Multiaxial thermomechanical deformation utilizing a non-unified plasticity model. Peter Kurath, University of Illinois; and Jason Howard Jones , Hughes Space and Communi- cations . The ability to model inelastic deformation is of practical interest in many design applications, especially with the current emphasis on lighter weight structures and components operating at higher temperatures. Thermomechanical deformation poses several chal- lenges in the sense that material properties change with temperature, and at higher temperatures time-dependent phenomena such as creep and/or stress relaxation are active deformation mechanisms. Due to recent success modeling many time-independent plastic deformations, recent modifications of the Armstrong-Frederick-type plasticity formulations are utilized as a basis for the current model. The choice to implement as non-unified model is based on the notion that distinct or independent mechanisms govern time- dependent or independent plastic deformations. The literature also suggests a similar scenario with regard to the damage accumulation. Furthermore, it was deemed desirable to maintain the tensorial nature in both time-independent and "creep" stress-strain behavior especially for more complex multiaxial thermomechanical loadings such as those that may be encountered when analyzing residual stresses resulting from welding. A Sherby-Dorn creep stress power law relationship is utilized to model time-dependent deformation, along with a separate nontranslating creep yield surface. Uniaxial isothermal experiments are employed to fit the modeling constants. Uniaxial, torsional and axial-torsional thermomechanical loadings are analyzed with three constraint conditions. Additional isothermal relaxation tests are examined to verify the basic concepts of the model. Omission of an adequate primary creep model is seen to inhibit the predictive capability at some temperature regimes, but the overall qualitative capabilities of the model are in agreement with the experimental results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2000-01-2753. (P-358) Dynamic modeling of brake friction coefficients. Wei-Yi Loh , R. Hecht Bäsch, D. Li, and P. Sanders, Ford Motor Co. Friction behavior is one of the most critical factors in brake sys- tem design and performance. For up-front design and system model- ing it is desirable to be able to describe a lining's frictional behavior as a function of the local conditions, such as contact pressure, tem- perature and sliding speed. Typically, frictional performance is assessed using brake dynamometer testing of full-scale hardware, and an average friction value is used during brake system develop- ment. This traditional approach yields an average brake friction coefficient that is hardware-dependent and fails to capture in-stop friction variation; it is also unavailable in advance of component testing, ruling out true up-front design and prediction. To address these shortcomings, a scaled inertial brake dynamom- eter was used to determine the frictional characteristics of candidate lining materials. Dynamic modeling techniques were then applied to develop a hardware-independent, empirical friction function with respect to contact load, rotor temperature and rotor speed. It was demonstrated that a growth model can be used for dynamic predic- tion of the instantaneous friction coefficient and rotor temperature during simulated braking events. Nonlinear regression and numeri- cal optimization techniques were applied to solve the dynamic equa- tions that describe local friction and temperature as a function of ini- tial load. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2000-01-2760. (P-358) Ultra Q™ process. Anwar R. Daudi and Wes Dickerson, Hayes Lemmerz International, Inc. Hayes Lemmerz has made an enormous leap in technology by creating a new '4 in 1' disc rotor that solves brake industry noise, dimension accuracy, thermal diffusivity and 'hot spot' rotor prob- lems. By closely adhering to a disciplined system of concurrent planning, product development and production feasibility studies (which included material development and CAE design and dyna- mometer and vehicle tests), Hayes has solved the brake industry's top four warranty concerns. Development of several propriety man- ufacturing methods, production system/equipment and quality assurance procedures followed to bring this product from the Devel- opment Laboratory to the Production Plants. Hayes 'new brake rotor is designed with damped iron composi- tion, 72 curve fin rotor geometry and is then processed using Hayes 'patented ULTRA-Q process. The 72 curve fin rotor design, developed through previous Hayes efforts creates a 100 degrees F cooler running rotor. Hayes now adds the strength of the ULTRA-Q process to create a highly damped, thermal diffused and dimension- ally accurate rotor. In this paper, Hayes summarizes high damping, one of the four impressive characteristics of its patented rotor: (1) high cooling (2) high damping (3) high thermal diffusivity and (4) highly accurate dimensions. Customers interested in resolving one or more of the above issues may purchase Hayes'rotor with any of these characteristics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2000-01-2763. (P-358) Cost effective Aluminium MMC brake discs. Claes Kuylenstierna, Volvo Technological Development Corp.; and Torkil Stor stein, Norsk Hydro ASA. A substantial amount of work has been carried out trying to reach the targets for MMC-brakes. The challenge has been to both meet the function and cost demands. A significant improvement of the transfer layer stability has now been achieved by a treatment of the surface of the disc material. This treatment makes it possible to operate at relatively high temperatures without exceeding 20% SiC in the matrix. When taking the improvements in the NVH area in consideration, the MMC discs offer a cost-effective solution for future cars. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2000-01-2770. (P-358) Generating 3-dimensional animations of vehicle brake noise. Chris Talbot, Kamal Al.Banawi, and John D. Fieldhouse, University of Huddersfield. Brake noise investigations using the whole body visual technique of double pulsed holographic interferometry have been extended so that a series of interferograms may be recorded over a cycle of exci- tation providing information about the amplitude, direction, phase relationship and the mode of vibration of the principal component parts of the brake. This work investigates the possibility of automat- ically interrogating the holographic images and creating an ani- mated 3 dimensional image of a brake generating noise. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0001. Performance improvement by space-efficient on-glass mounting technique for integrated antenna electronics. Gerd Gottwald, Hirschmann Electronics GmbH &amp; Co. Modern cars are more and more equipped with integrated antenna systems providing a growing number of RF services (AM, FM, TV, RKE, mobile phone, GPS, etc.). After reflecting the state- of-the-art mounting and the connection technique of the electronics and its disadvantages this paper presents a new on-glass mounting technique which is meanwhile installed in the new Audi A4. The most important features of this new concept are high modularity, improvements of RF reception properties, and significant reduction in the overall system costs. 2001-01-0002.

The impact of multiple sample rates on multi- media system design. James L. Czekaj , Visteon Corp. Within the modern automotive multimedia system there can be a variety of applications utilizing digital audio data at various sam- ple rates. Examples of this are CD audio, MPEG-1 Layer III audio and synthesized speech. Furthermore the requirements of a synchro- nous multimedia network and the distributed nature of some systems can greatly impact the system's architecture. These factors mandate a careful evaluation of sample rate conversion requirements as well as a judicious implementation of the sample rate conversion process. Various scenarios exhibiting these features are examined along with potential architectural solutions. An asynchronous sample rate conversion algorithm, based on b-splines and implemented on a DSP, is also examined and evaluated with regards to output total harmonic distortion plus noise levels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0006. Pheripheral SDAR interoperability. Robert Hjelmeland and Chris Ols, Delphi Automotive Systems. Radio broadcasting has entered the digital era, where services are delivered from the studio to the listener entirely in the digital domain. The Satellite Digital Audio Receiver Systems (SDARS) being developed provides the means to receive high-quality digital radio services. The SDARS receiver will be a peripheral component to the existing audio system in the vehicle for the first generation. Subsequent generations of the product will examine the opportunity for up-integrating the SDARS receiver into the modules of existing entertainment system. This paper will outline a set of common oper- ating characteristics that may be used in peripheral SDAR applica- tions. If adhered to, this will allow the XM Satellite Radio service and Sirius Satellite Radio service to co-habitat on the same audio system or be interchangeable at a receiver module level. Many of the points discussed in this paper are not specific to or under the con- trol of the SDARs service providers. Some items require compliance with existing vehicle practices while others are new to the automo- tive environment. 2001-01-0008. Dual antenna system for mobile SDARS appli- cation. Ron Marino and Andreas Fuchs, RecepTec LLC. The development of the mobile SDARS (Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service) dual function (satellite and terrestrial) antenna has been focused on a design, that is both spec compliant and estheti- cally pleasing, which has the capability of being mass-produced in the automotive industry. Numerous antenna concepts have been evaluated and tested in this development process. The results of the evaluation study along with the detailed design and performance (both measured and simulated) of a current production antenna (patent pending) will be presented. 2001-01-0011. S.C.A.R.E.S. - Satellite car audio reception evaluation system. Andreas Fuchs and Sven Conrad, RecepTec L.L.C. During 2001, vehicle owners will subscribe to new services pro- vided by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc., and XM Radio, Inc., who offer coast-to-coast, digital quality radio programming via satellite. Vehi- cles will be equipped with a unique reception system (receiver and antenna), initially dealer installed or purchased in the retail after- market, but shortly available as original equipment from vehicle manufacturers. The introduction and application of this new technology in a rela- tively short timeframe poses special challenges to service providers, vehicle manufacturers and system suppliers in terms of measuring, evaluating and validating the quality of broadcasts and the perfor- mance of system components under various critical conditions. This paper presents an innovative method for simultaneously recording satellite reception characteristics under those conditions and for evaluating reception quality in a repeatable and documented manner. 2001-01-0013. Measurement and evaluation of distortion in vehicle audio systems. Mark Ziemba, Matsushita Communication Industrial of U.S.A. Vehicle audio system designers attempt to achieve the maximum SPL possible with a tolerable amount of distortion.

Some novel measurement techniques are explored and evaluated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0015. (SP- 1587) Metrics in software development. Larry Leveille, Pacific Information Design, Inc. Software development is at best a difficult to manage process. Development progress is often hard to measure. In part this is due to the 'soft' nature of the task, with inadequate measurements, con- tinual changes in definition, and an inconsistent measurement meth- odology all playing a part. Metrics provide a basis for measuring meaningful progress (or the lack of it) on a project. The impact of requirement changes can be tracked and reported, and the use of a set of metrics over several projects gives consistency to the mea- surement and reporting process. This paper presents the need for metrics in software develop- ment. Several possible metrics are discussed, including their appli- cability to specific uses. Additionally, 'real- world' cases illustrating the use of metrics are presented. Specifically, the use of metrics in the software estimating process is addressed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0016.

(SP- 1587) Customer requirements and requirements analysis example. Ronald P. Brombach , Ford Motor Co. Customers want new and exciting features in their vehicles. As the cost of implementing features goes down, OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are eager to provide customers with these new "toys." Because being "Fast to market" is paramount, there is a tendency to shortcut the development process. If the Cus- tomer Requirements are not clearly understood, problems can occur late in the design process. This causes production delays and lost revenues. It is easier and more cost effective to identify and correct problems before finalizing the design. During initial development of a vehicle, engineers are given a list of performance requirements or feature behaviors. Careful analysis of requirements early in the design process will minimize software defects and incorrect behavior. This paper provides an example of Customer requirements and a process to analyze those requirements. The example used is an illuminated entry control system for auto- motive application. 2001-01-0019. (SP-1587) Software lessons learned the hard way. James M. Weinfurther, Allen E. Fenderson , Daniel M. King , and Ronald P. Brombach, Ford Motor Co. This paper introduces several requirements that have been cre- ated based on lessons learned at Ford Motor Company. This is not a collection of requirements already addressed by MISRA. These are requirements which address repeated or costly problems that have been observed at Ford Motor Company in their Electronic Body Modules. Real- world examples of why they were needed will be highlighted as well as the principles used to create them and con- firm compliance. Electronic Body Modules at Ford Motor Company usually con- trol Interior Lighting, Exterior Lighting, Chime, Wipers, Power Mirrors, Power Seats and other features related to passenger com- fort. These modules typically use less than 32 K of ROM and are written in C. While some modules are connected to a vehicle net- work, others are stand-alone. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0022. (SP-1587) Foundations for rapid embedded development. Joseph J. Lemieux , EDS Embedded Solutions. When an architect designs a building, the foundation is designed first, then the structure, and finally the details of the building. In embedded development, the foundation is the basic software upon which the program is built, such as the startup code and operating system. The walls and the details are similar to the actual software application and user interface. In order to build embedded applica- tions rapidly, a standard foundation must be in place. This allows the application developers to focus their creative energies on how the application will "look and feel." This paper will describe the methods for building a software foundation to streamline embedded systems development. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0024. (SP-1587) Connecting Simulink to OSEK: Automatic code generation for real-time operating systems with TargetLink. Lutz Köster , Thomas Thomsen, and Ralf Stracke, dSPACE. This paper describes how one further step towards integrating the complete software development process of embedded real-time sys- tems in Simulink and Stateflow is achieved. Automatic code genera- tion in production quality is already possible with dSPACE' s Tar- getLink. The next step is true integration of real-time operating sys- tems into the code generation process. The OSEK standard is applied for this purpose and briefly described at the beginning. The article then focuses on concepts and techniques used by TargetLink to achieve OSEK-compliant code generation. It is shown, how oper- ating system functions and properties are specified on a block dia- gram level, how code of different sample rates is bundled into differ- ent tasks, how tasks can communicate among each other and how all this can be simulated on a target system. The paper also gives striking evidence of how powerful standards can boost tool develop- ment and how they can help integrate different tool systems, which had been completely separated before. 2001-01-0025. (SP-1587) A case study in applying a product line approach for car periphery supervision systems. Steffen Thiel, Stefan Ferber, Thomas Fischer, Andreas Hein, and Michael Schlick, Robert Bosch GmbH. Car Periphery Supervision (CPS) systems comprise a family of automotive systems that are based on sensors installed around the vehicle to monitor its environment. The measurement and evalua- tion of sensor data enables the realization of several kinds of higher level applications such as parking assistance or blind spot detection. Although a lot of similarity can be identified among CPS applica- tions, these systems are traditionally built separately. Usually, each single system is built with its own electronic control unit, and it is likely that the application software is bound to the controller's hard- ware. Current systems engineering therefore often leads to a large number of inflexible, dedicated systems in the automobile that together consume a large amount of power, weight, and installation space and produce high manufacturing and maintenance costs. This paper reports on an initiative undertaken by the Bosch Group in applying a product line development approach to develop CPS systems economically. Product line development represents a multi-system engineering approach which takes common and vari- able aspects between systems in the same application domain into account. It provides a basis to develop a line of products economi- cally based on a common system architecture and reusable compo- nents. A product line allows the degree of reusability to be optimized across different systems while simultaneously preserving the overall quality. This supports the need to develop more integrated and flexi- ble multi-functional systems quickly and cost-effectively. The pur- pose of this paper is to report on the experiences and results obtained from a case study in developing a product line of CPS systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0029. (SP-1587) Information technology - A chal- lenge for automotive electronics. Karlheinz Topp and Jens Weber, Robert Bosch GmbH. In the automotive industry, a steadily growing number of mono- functional electronic control units (ECUs) with increasing complex- ity on the one hand and restrictive requirements for power consump- tion and mounting space on the other hand are forcing changes in car electronics. This tendency is enforced by increasing require- ments on security, comfort, fuel consumption and emission. In lux- ury cars, we are now at up to 80 more or less independent electronic units with low potential for synergies between functions (pan- functional services). The actual assembly of electronic units is cer- tainly easily expandable, has very low error propagation but it also involves lots of logistic and bulky cabling with unwanted weight as well as extensive space and power consumption. If trends are properly interpreted, synergies between functions for more comfort, additional safety and security as well as minor air pollution are required in the future at least at unchanged costs in the vehicle's electronics. To be cost effective this requires as far as pos- sible software implementation. Therefore, the current multi-unit electronics solution might be replaced in a long-term range by a fully networked client/server-architecture built up from component technology and an IT conform layering structure with basic func- tions, middleware and applications. 5</page><page sequence="5">2001-01-0016-2001-01-0036 The client/server-architecture uses the clients for real time and safety features and to provide limp-home functionality; the server(s) implement(s) higher level services, i.e., pan-functional services, telematic services and a common user interface. An increasing num- ber (depending on server capabilities) of the former non-real-time control units can be totally replaced by pure software solutions on the server(s). This new electronic structure promises easy installa- tion of new functions and additional pan-functional services on a settled architecture and opens an attractive after sales market. On the other hand, the requirement for a settled new electronics architecture introduces an ambitious systems-engineering challenge to prepare an integration concept based on a commonly agreed Reference Architecture in the automotive industry. In this paper, the proposed client/server architecture and corre- sponding software architecture will be described in detail and the distribution of functions will be discussed. The problems coming up with a possible new electronics architecture will be addressed and proposals to overcome them will be given. 2001-01-0030. (SP- 1578) Advanced progress in the numerical analysis of car antenna systems. Gerd Gottwaldy Markus Pfletsch- inger, and Peter Riedhof er, Hirschmann Electronics GmbH &amp; Co., KG. In this paper, a new hybrid method for the numerical simulation of antennas placed on large objects with respect to the wavelength (especially on cars) is presented. The fields in the vicinity of the actual radiating element are calculated by the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method, which allows an easy treatment of different dielectric and metallic materials. To simulate the open boundary the PML (perfect matched layers) method is used. Apply- ing Love's equivalence principle, the calculated fields on the surface of the FDTD calculation region can be used as excitation sources in the remaining unbound volume. In this region, the Method of Moments (MoM) is applied so it is not necessary to divide the com- plete space into small elements. The presented examples show the validity of this numerically efficient approach. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0031. (SP- 1578) A parametric model to generate subsystem constitutive laws for a vehicle ride model. Derek K. Hogland, General Motors Corp.; and C. W. Mous seau. University of Toledo. In conventional system modeling, some constitutive laws gov- erning the performance of a major subsystem must be derived by testing existing hardware. However, if a system model is to be employed in the early stages of vehicle development, then separate models are required to generate the necessary subsystem constitu- tive laws strictly from basic design parameters and very simple com- ponent tests. This paper demonstrates how a computer model can generate the same complex kinematic data generated by a test for a vehicle sus- pension subsystem, and how these results can be integrated with a system-level, vehicle ride model. The suspension model presented is constructed primarily from design parameters, with some use of easier-to-obtain empirical data (such as load/deflection relationships of the jounce bumpers). This paper also discusses an improved approach to modeling the coil spring in a double A-arm suspension. This effort successfully generated the quasi-static responses used for suspension parameters in the ride model without requiring com- plex empirical data. Relationships such as load vs. vertical deflec- tion at the spindle and kinematic path of the spindle in jounce and rebound are presented. The model is completely parametric allow- ing the user flexibility to explore design change concepts or to apply it to an entirely separate vehicle. The model presented could be use- ful at any stage of vehicle and suspension development by different engineers, as it requires minimal understanding of the modeling software itself. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0032. (SP-1578) Dynamic stress analysis of a vehicle frame by flexible multibody dynamics simulation. Kwon-Hee Suh, Kia Motors Corp. ; and Yoon-Ki Lee and Hi-Seak Yoon, Chon- nam National Univ. This paper presents the CAE technique to estimate the dynamic stress in a vehicle structure at an early stage in the vehicle design process, using modal stress superposition. Dynamic joint reaction forces are obtained by flexible multibody dynamics simulation using DADS. Stress influence coefficients are computed through the inertia relief analysis using MSC/NASTRAN. A test vehicle was run over a zigzag bump course with a constant speed of 40 km/hr, and the results of the numerical analysis were compared to those of the test. 2001-01-0033. (SP-1578) Use of CAE technology in DENSO A/C development. Hideo Asano, Motohiro Kitada, and Shigeyoshi Nagaya, DENSO Corp. In view of the shorter development period for new automobiles, we have developed a computer-aided engineering (CAE) system to aid in commensurately speedy development of automotive air con- ditioners. This system consists of three tools: one that calculates var- ious design specifications instantaneously, one that enables design- ers to easily examine air-conditioner shape, and one that converts shape data into calculable model data to enable 3D (three- dimensional) processing. Effective use of these tools cuts air- conditioner development lead time to half that of the conventional process. 2001-01-0034. (SP-1578) Development and implementation of simulation tool for vehicle brake system. Tsuyoshi Yamada and Masashi Sawada, AISIN SEIKI Co., Ltd. A simulation tool has been developed to predict pressure charac- teristics and performances of the brake system. This simulation tool includes model libraries of brake components which are described using the MATLAB®/SIMULINK™. Engineers can visually and easily make simulation models using these model libraries since programming is not necessary. Vehicle dynamics model is also included in the model libraries to simulate vehicle behavior due to the brake system. Characteristics and performances of the brake sys- tem can be evaluated whether vehicle requirements are satisfied or not as a whole vehicle. We have extremely reduced the development period for the brake system since the development efficiency is increased using this simulation tool. 2001-01-0035. (SP-1578) Contact mechanics simulation for hot spots investigation. D. Suryatama, D. J. Stewart, S. C. Mey- land, and L. J. Hou, DaimlerChrysler Corp. Rapid wear out of a disk brake due to phenomena commonly known as hot spots is one of various problems faced by brake manu- facturers. Hot spots are localized high temperature areas generated on the frictional surface of a disk brake during braking. The non- uniform surface expansion caused by hot spots on the disk surface may cause pedal pulsation or known as thermal judder. This effect in die long run will shorten a brake's life. Numerical simulation of a disk brake requires the use of nonlinear contact mechanics approach. The simulation is computationally very expensive and difficult to perform. A computer simulation technique has been developed at the DaimlerChrysler Brake Core Group to investigate the hot spot phenomena since 1997. The technique was imple- mented on 3-D finite element models to simulate frictional contacts between the disk and its pads. Computer code ABAQUS is used for these analyses and computations are performed in Silicon Graphics, Origin 2000 machines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0036.

(SP- 1578) An automatic mesh generator-based CFD system to be used as a design tool. Tatsuhito Matsushima, Software Cradle Co. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) system is presented. The system, called SCRYU/Tetra, is based on an automatic tetrahedral mesh generator and has been developed as a design tool for engi- neers who are not necessarily fluid dynamics specialists, but are seeking better designs of their equipment through CFD analysis. In order to make the system useful for non-specialists, efforts are taken so that the system can handle complicated geometry from CAD sys- tems, does not require any special skill which is not essential for the understanding of the flow phenomenon itself, and is accurate enough to correctly identify the best design candidate from others. Microsoft WINDOWS PC's are chosen as the main hardware plat- form to make the analysis cost low. The system has demonstrated an ability to complete analysis in a very short time (typically a few days) with satisfactory accuracy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0038. (SP- 1578) Co-simulation: Developing a virtual vehicle modeling capability. J. G. McManus and S. R. Anderson , Ricardo , Inc. Many general-purpose and specialized simulation tools have been developed to assist engineers analyzing vehicle systems such as the engine, transmission, or control systems. Analyses have typi- cally been carried out using these tools individually to address spe- cific design and development issues. This divided approach limits the treatment of integrated system dynamics that may be important in refining dynamic system or control designs. Increasingly, these modeling tools have become more flexible, allowing analyses to be carried out simultaneously and in a coupled way using co- simulation. This paper describes a typical development process and the ways in which co-simulation may be valuable in analyzing sys- tems. A co-simulation example applied to a transmission develop- ment is given in which a complete vehicle is modeled using three simulation tools running simultaneously. This enables the strengths of the individual, specialized simulation tools to be exploited, with- out compromising model fidelity, while the system interactions are fully represented. 2001-01-0039. (SP-1578) A numerical model for passenger car ride comfort studies. Paulo C. Greco, Jr., Clovis S. de Barcel- los, and Aristóteles da Rosa Neto, Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. A Matlab-based numerical model of a complete vehicle was developed for ride comfort studies. The objective of the paper is to present a comparison between numerical and experimental results. The experimental work was conducted on a rough road, on a smooth road and on a standard profile composed of a flat road with a square metallic obstacle. Vibration data was collected on a few vehicle points necessary for the vibration transmission analysis. To develop a full vehicle model several representations of the main vehicle parts, associated with vibration transmission and absorption, were implemented. Numerical results and experimental data showed good correlation for the impulsive disturbance on the standard profile test. Results for the random disturbance on smooth and rough roads showed better correlation for a point of contact tire model than for a fixed contact length tire model. 2001-01-0040.

In recent years, the perceived quality of powered seat adjusters based on their sound during operation has become a primary con- cern for vehicle and seat manufacturers. Historical noise targets based on overall dB(A) at the occupant's ear have consistently proved inadequate as a measure of the sound quality of a seat adjuster. Significant effort has been devoted to develop alternative sound quality metrics that can truly discriminate between "good" and "bad" seat adjusters. These new metrics have been successfully applied for some years by product development engineers in test labs. However, in the assembly plant the sound quality of the seat adjuster is still assessed subjectively by an operator at the end of the assembly line. The main problem with this approach is not only the lack of consistency and repeatability across large samples of seat tracks, but also the fact that the only feedback provided from the end-of-line to the product development team is of subjective nature. This subjective information is of little help for the engineers who have to diagnose and remedy the problem. Additionally, since sound quality has become one of the main reasons for rejection at the end of the assembly line, there is the need for integrating sound quality performance checks with the standard quality control or functional checks in the manufacturing environment. Therefore, the new chal- lenge for the seat adjuster manufacturer is to implement at the end of the assembly line an automated Sound Quality-based inspection system that relies exclusively on objective parameters. The authors of this paper have devoted a lot of effort toward developing such a system, and this paper will describe and discuss the main issues related to its design, implementation and validation. 2001-01-0041. (SP-1578) Optimizing the effects of body attachment stiffness on steering column in-vehicle modes. Kumar B. Kulkami and Ravi S. Thyagarajan, Visteon Corp. This paper presents an unambiguous and intuitive method for identification of steering column resonant (SCR) mode of vibration. One simple but overlooked technique to determine the SCR mode in-vehicle is to provide local stiffnesses of the body locations where the instrument panel (IP) attaches, to the IP suppliers to be used in their design and development. This paper describes how this tech- nique is useful in predicting the first few important in-vehicle steer- ing column modes for different classes of vehicles, with examples presented in each class. The results obtained from such analyses are compared against those from direct in-buck simulations. This tech- nique is not limited to its application in developing IP systems, but can easily be extended to include other systems such as seats, fuel tanks, etc. Also it is shown that a design optimization analysis may be performed using these attachment stiffnesses as design variables resulting in a system level solution. 2001-01-0042. (SP-1578) Modeling of nonlinear elastomeric mounts - Part 1: Dynamic testing and parameter identification. Y a Pu and Hartono Sumali, Purdue Univ.; and Christophe L. Gail- lard, ArvinMeritor. A methodology for modeling elastomeric mounts as non-linear lumped parameter models is discussed. A key feature of this meth- odology is that it integrates dynamic test results under different con- ditions into the model. The first step is to model the mount as a lin- ear model that is simple but reproduces accurately results from dynamic tests under small excitations. Frequency Response Func- tions (FRF) enables systematic calculation of the parameters for the model. Under more realistic excitation, the mount exhibits non- linearity, which is investigated in the next step. For nonlinear struc- tures, a simple and intuitive method is to use time-domain force- displacement (F-x) curves. Experiments to obtain the F-x curves involve controlling the dis- placement excitation and measuring the induced forces. From the F-x curves, stiffness and damping parameters are obtained with an optimization technique. 7</page><page sequence="7">2001-01-0036-2001-01-0048 The paper also discusses the variation of stiffness and damping parameters with mean force and amplitude. Analytical expressions for spring constants and damping factor are obtained as functions of preload, amplitude and velocity. This paper is the first of two papers describing the research effort on the elastomeric mount. The companion paper will discuss numer- ical modeling to validate and improve the relationship between the experiment results and the analytical model. 2001-01-0043. (SP-1578) Modeling of nonlinear elastomeric mounts - Part 2: Comparing numerical model and test results. Ya Pu and Hartono Sumali , Purdue Univ.; and Christophe L. Gail- lard, ArvinMeritor. This paper presents the continuation of the modeling work described in a companion paper "Modeling of Nonlinear Elasto- meric Mounts. Part 1: Dynamic Testing and Parameter Identifica- tion" by the same authors. That paper discussed a dynamic test pro- cedure and an optimization methodology to identify and model an elastomeric mount as a non-linear lumped parameter structure. This paper discusses a numerical modeling methodology to confirm or improve the agreement between the dynamic test results and the input-output relationship of the analytical model generated in the companion paper. In this paper, the model developed in the companion paper and the model parameters are input into a dynamic simulation model using a commercial simulation package. The model is then run to produce the numerical force-versus-displacement (F-x) curves of the mount. The numerical F-x curves are compared with the F-x curves obtained from the experiments. The comparison shows good agreement between the two sets of results, indicating that the model represents the elastomeric mount with accuracy. The paper also discusses the effect of different optimization objective functions on the accuracy of the parameter estimation and the simulation results. 2001-01-0044. (SP- 1591) The effect of drinking on driver's visuospatial working memory. Kong Fansen, Jilin Univ.; Sui Jie, Northeast Normal Univ.; Sui Jie, Hsin, Guan; and Sui Jie, Jilin Univ. Working Memory (WM) span is highly associated with complex cognitive tasks. Since driving is a complex cognitive task, it is sug- gested that working memory is highly associated with it. To verify this hypothesis, We designed five tasks, namely, two memory span tasks(visuospatial WM task and visuospatial memory task)and three reaction time tasks(simple reaction time?select reaction time and successive reaction time).By testing, we proved that: (1) Drinking had a great effect on driver's visuospatial WM, and the effect was mainly on information processing. (2) Driving is a complex cogni- tive manipulation activity. WM was a critical factor to predict com- plex cognitive manipulation activities. Therefore, we can use visuospatial WM as an important factor in driver selection and the evaluation of driving performance. 2001-01-0045. (SP- 1591) Driver characteristics at signal- controlled intersections. Thomas F. Fugger, Jr., Jesse L. Wobrock, and Bryan c. Randies, Accident Research and Biomechanics, Inc.; Anthony C. Stein, Safety Research and Associates, Inc.; and William C. Whiting, California State Univ. Vehicle acceleration rates and driver perception/reaction times exist in the accident reconstruction literature. However, scant data are available characterizing drivers in "real-world" situations. This study analyzes the perception/reaction times of drivers and initial acceleration rates of vehicles at signal-controlled intersec- tions in "real-world" situations. Collection and assessment of these data facilitate evaluation of human factors characteristics and safety- related issues at these intersections. The purpose of this paper is to employ a new methodology for obtaining and analyzing "real-world" driver data. These data were analyzed to determine perception/reaction time of drivers, from sig- nal change to initial forward movement, and vehicle acceleration rates, from a stationary position. 2001-01-0046. (SP- 1591) Mandatory air bag warnings: A human factors analysis of their development. Alan L. Dorris and Nathan T. Dorris, Dorris and Associates, Inc. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has twice mandated air bag warning labels. This paper reviews and analyzes NHTSA's activities in both the 1993 and 1996 rulemaking procedures against the framework of the available human factors engineering (HFE) and warning literature. It utilizes the filli record of the rulemaking process including Federal Register notices and docket submissions to identify the analyses and decisions made by the agency in developing these rules. This analysis concludes that in both the 1993 and 1996 rulemak- ing procedures, NHTSA developed labeling requirements that appropriately addressed the respective injury prevention policies and strategies of those timeframes. In most regards, the agency properly identified and responded to HFE criteria although some methodological improvements could be obtained. More signifi- cantly, the HFE literature is found to inadequately meet the needs of regulatory agencies or others who would develop precautionary labeling. 2001-01-0047. (SP- 1591) The smell of success - Exploiting the leather aroma. Robert Van Lente, Garden State Tanning; and Ste- phen J. Herman, AFF International. The sense of smell has profound importance for humans. The scent of pine reminds us of Christmas; the smell of turkey brings back memories of Thanksgivings past. There is a scientific reason that happens. Our olfactory and limbic systems collect, transmit and decode aromas into emotions and even into behavior. We can't see or physically feel this facet of consumer satisfaction. But it has a strong influence. Consumers care as much about their new car's smell as its horsepower. Automakers have indirectly changed the new car smell through the evolution of materials used in automotive interiors. They have also directly changed it through attempts to amplify the leather smell and, in some recent cases, to actually engineer a total interior smell. The direct techniques have had varying degrees of success, mea- sured as consumer ratings of "that new car smell" in annual J.D. Power and Associates Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout (APE AL) studies. Leather is the only interior material that carries the burden of sat- isfying a consumer's expectation for a specific smell. Yet, when leather is the only interior aroma that is controlled, the results can be undesirable. Other interior smells can mix poorly with the aroma chosen for the leather, to offset or minimize the intended effect. Evaluation of annual new car smell ratings and proprietary con- sumer research have led two suppliers to propose a new approach in exploiting leather's unique olfactory powers. 2001-01-0048. (SP- 1591) The perfectly silent car - An engi- neering goal? Hans Martin Gerhard, Porsche AG. A look at the car development of today shows that even strictly cost-oriented cars try to give their customers comfort and calm rid- ing. High value cars explain themselves as a substitution for your home when you are on the road. Even from the environmental point of view, people, governments and many associations claim for more reduction of the noise emitted by vehicles. So can it be really a question that the main scope of engineering should be the development of cars as silent as possible? Noise or sound is something that is present even if it seems to be silent. Information are exchanged and emotions controlled. The answer to the above question is not only a technical one but also is touched by marketing and political issues. 8</page><page sequence="8">200 1 -0 1 -0048-200 1 -0 1 -0054 On the way through the global vehicle noise vibration and harsh- ness (NVH) the following lecture shows that sound design and engi- neering, acoustic quality, customers expectations and noise legisla- tion are the important areas to define the noise behavior of a car. 2001-01-0049. (SP- 1591) Minimizing driver demands and data acquisition errors in trailer testing. M. Mark Leonard, Ste- ven M. Tuskan, and Dutch Johnson , Exponent Failure Analysis Associates. In testing to determine the yaw oscillation response of a vehicle- trailer combination, the vehicle combination is driven in a straight line, at a specified speed; then a rapid, fixed-amplitude, short- duration pulse is applied to the steering wheel, while maintaining a constant speed. These requirements often result in multiple test runs to ensure an acceptable minimum variability in the damping ratio estimate for the vehicle-trailer combination. This paper investigates techniques for relieving the demands placed on the driver and for acquiring and processing the data required for analysis from this test. The testing used two different vehicle-trailer combinations, two different drivers, and an Auto- mated Steering Controller (ASC). Damping ratio estimate compari- sons were made between drivers, drivers and the ASC, transducers, data filtering, and calculation methods. The use of the ASC signifi- cantly reduced the demands placed on the test driver, provided more consistent data at each test speed, and reduced the number of test runs required at each test speed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-0050. (SP- 1591) Air bags and infants - The need for placing rear-facing infants in the back seat brings about acci- dent-causing distractions. Dan Goor, Xportation Safety Concepts , Inc.; and Lee Stucki, Stucki Engineering and Information Services. There is little or no doubt that air bags save lives in accidents. Passenger-side air bags are generally effective safety devices; how- ever, in special cases there are damaging side effects. Damaging and unintended by-products of [passenger side] air bags include, but are not limited to, injuries such as abrasions, bro- ken bones, and damaged knees. Passenger air bags are especially threatening to short people (generally under 4' 10"), to those who allow the passenger seat to be placed too close to an air bag, to vari- ous size children, and especially to rear-facing infants. Placing the passenger seat too close to an air bag can be classified as "misuse." Misuse also include those who may place their feet on the dash, and then either lose, or have legs severely damaged when the air bag deploys. Even though air bags were designed to take into account as much of the population as possible, anomalies do exist. Air bags, when properly used and when they interact with more- or-less typical size people, do work. As early as 1991, the author was put in a position to have personal verification of air bag effec- tiveness. While having crash tests conducted by the National Test- ing Laboratories (NTL), in Virginia, the author was privileged to see the two now famous 1991 Chrysler Lebaron vehicles which hit each other head-on, while the two lady drivers were unscathed and sitting beside the cars talking to each other when the state trooper arrived. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words; the two Chryslers at NTL offered just such a picture. The cars were severely damaged, if one did not know what actually transpired, the only con- clusion that could have been reached would clearly suggest major injuries, if not more. Air bags do work, but air bags have shortcom- ings, and as they are now, only deal with a limited portion of the population who fit in the "typical" part of the population bell curve. All that notwithstanding, it is time to examine those who are par- ticularly in harms way when riding in a car. Adult short people who face air bag danger, can, and do speak for themselves, they have a political voice, lobbies, and advocacy groups. This scenario holds true to other adults to whom an air bag is a potential for harm. The group that is most threatened by air bags, however, is a group of people who cannot yet fend for themselves, it is made up of infants who must ride rear-facing in a car. Infants, obviously, are a special group of air bag endangered occupants whose seating situation is determined by parents or care- takers. Contrary to recommendations that infants be placed in the rear seat, many parents and caretakers feel that for emotional, physi- cal, health, or most importantly for less distraction, their infant should be in the front seat by them. Our mission in this paper is to offer some insight and visibility to the problems rear-facing infants face in travel. 2001-01-0051. (SP- 1591) Comfort and usability of the seat belts. Rana Baici and Alicia Vertiz , Delphi Automotive Systems ; and Wenqi Shen, Sprint PCS. Seat belts are the primary occupant-protection devices for vehi- cle crashes. Field statistics show that proper usage of seat belts sub- stantially contributes to decreases in the fatality rate and injury level. To collect first-hand information regarding seat belt comfort and usability, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The most sig- nificant problems were found as belt trapping in the door, awkward negotiating with clothes, belt twisting, belt locking up, and difficulty to locate the buckle. The survey results indicated that drivers who are over 40 years old have more complaints than younger drivers. When the driver's age increases to 55 and above, belt pulling force and inappropriate and loose fitting of the belt on the body become major issues. Female drivers have more complaints than male driv- ers. Short statured drivers need both hands to pull and guide the retracting of the belt. The participants who are over 66th percentile in terms of their weight have complaints about belt twisting. The coupe type of vehicles have the least comfortable seat belts com- pared with other vehicle types. The most comfortable seat belts are found in sedan and SUV type vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0052. (SP- 1591) Driver- vehicle interface require- ments for a transit bus collision avoidance system. Stephen J. Reinach and Jeffrey H. Everson, Foster-Miller , Inc. This paper discusses the development of driver- vehicle interface (DVI) requirements for an inner-city transit bus collision avoidance system (CAS). In 1998, there were over 23,000 transit bus collisions resulting in over 20,000 injuries. Using structured interviews with transit bus operators and naturalistic observation, the transit bus operating environment was characterized. Then, a set of CAS func- tional requirements was generated. Lastly, a set of human factors DVI requirements for a transit bus CAS was developed. The DVI requirements focused on the physical aspects of the display and the display's cognitive demands on the bus operator. 2001-01-0053. (SP- 1591) Development of a power window switch with improved ergonomics. Takashi Shinzato, Hideaki Hayakawa , Masato Nishikawa , and Eiji Matsuoka, Tokai Rika Co., Ltd. This paper explains a methodology to develop a Power Window Switch (PWS) that is easy to operate. Many PWS knobs use a pivot movement. The most popular shapes are: 1 .Pull-up/Push-down, 2. Rocker, and 3. Toggle. In the Pull-up/Push-down PWS, the knob motion matches the window motion. Since the design of the knob prevents an object or a part of clothing from catching, and pulling the knob up, potential injury from the window coming up is avoided. The knob top surface of the pull up PWS is pushed down to open the window, and the knob front surface is pulled up to close it. One weakness of this design is that the operating finger posture changes each time the window direction changes, the finger will often become tired with the repetitive posture changes. Another weakness of the Pull-up/ Push-down PWS is the flush top surface of the knob to the bezel. The size of the knob and corresponding finger well limits the size of the finger and length of the fingernail. 2001-01-0054.

Kazumoto Morita and Ichiro Sakamoto, Traffic Safety and Nuisance Research Institute. 9</page><page sequence="9">2001-01-0048-2001-01-0065 When a driver views the display device, there are two ways to read the information displayed: repeatedly diverting his attention to the display device for short periods of time or reading the informa- tion through, all at one time. The authors investigated differences in the amount of information retained for both of these reading methods by carrying out experiments indoors. This experiment showed that even when the amount of time that the subject was actu- ally viewing the display was the same, the amount of data acquired by the subject from reading the display repeatedly was greater than the amount of information acquired by reading the display through at one time. 2001-01-0058. (SP- 1594) A study of evaluating the real-time property for engine control software. Hideaki Suganuma and Koji Sato, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Hiroaki Takada, Toyohashi Univer- sity of Technology. Recently, the role of ECU (Electronic Control Unit) on vehicles has been becoming more important year by year in order to meet the requirements for safety and the environmental matters. Particu- larly, the ECU of Engine Management Systems has been becoming indispensable in order to realize high performance, low fuel con- sumption and low exhaust emission. Therefore, the size of software has also been increasing, and been becoming more complex and complicated. As the ECU software size becomes large and complex, the verifi- cation and validation of the software by using the current develop- ment method has been becoming more difficult. Especially it has been becoming more difficult to validate the real-time property of the software. The real-time property means whether the execution of the software is in time for the deadline which is decided on the software design. This paper describes the methods that make it possible to verify the real-time situations of the Engine Control Software by applying the informational theory called RMA (Rate Monotonie Analysis) and experimental analysis in the early stage of the software design. 2001-01-0059. (SP- 1594) TTP/A: A low-cost, highly efficient, time-triggered fieldbus architecture. Ralf Schlatterbeck, Ti l ech Computertechnik AG; and Wilfried Eimenreich, Technical Univer- sity Vienna. TTP/A is the fieldbus protocol of the Time Triggered Architec- ture (TT A). It provides periodic transmission of real-time data and allows for on-line configuration, diagnostics, and maintenance by use of an interface file system. It is well integrated with the TTP/C protocol and is designed to meet the requirements of a low-cost sen- sor/actuator bus. TTP/A is a master-slave protocol where the master establishes a common time base within a TTP/A cluster. Since the master establishes the time base prior to the communication of slaves, the protocol can be implemented with low-cost on-chip RC oscillators for the slaves. Using a standard UART-based serial inter- face as physical layer, the slave TTP/A protocol can be implemented in very low-cost Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware. 2001-01-0060.

The current SAE classification system for serial data communi- cation protocols encompasses Class A, Class B, and Class C catego- ries. Because of the proliferation of applications and new protocols these three groups are not enough. This paper will introduce and dis- cuss several new categories which are Diagnostics, SafetyBus, Mobile Media, and X-by-Wire. The serial data protocols that fall under these categories are for the most part brand new and will serve distinct and unique tasks. All existing common vehicular multiplex protocols (approximately 40) will be categorized using the SAE convention plus the new groupings. Top contenders will be pointed out along with a discussion of the protocol in the best position to become the industry standard in each category. Future vehicle appli- cations having up to seven different data networks will be presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0061. Automated test system for electronic control units and prototypes of them in vehicle networks. Michael Grimm and Jochen Wiedemann, EKES, Research Institute for Auto- motive Engineering and Vehicle Engines. The number of electronic control units (ECU) in modern automo- biles has steadily increased lately. Joining them in a vehicle network causes complex bus structures, in which ECU's of different suppli- ers have to cooperate. In order to keep the development effort as small as possible, the automobile industry would rather have the possibility of testing these bus structures in an early state of devel- opment. This was the reason why we created a test system for the network management of a CAN-Low-Speed network, which sup- ports the test of an electronic control system in many states of devel- opment. This test system is able to check different network struc- tures and to search errors in the ECU's by checking the network management. This is done by an automatic test that generates an evaluation and a report. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0062.

(SP-1594) A study of DeviceNet technology for the low quantity vehicle industry. K. H. Tang, C. L. Ong, and R. T. McLaughlin, University of Warwick; and C. P. Quigley, Warwick Control Technologies Limited. The popularity of CAN (Controller Area Network) in the produc- tion vehicles is well established. As a result, CAN has been devel- oped for use in many non-automotive applications. This gave rise to the development of an open higher layer CAN protocol known as DeviceNet. With the popularity of DeviceNet for Automation Systems, this technology has drastically decreased in cost. Although DeviceNet is quite complex to develop, it easier to implement than SAE J 1939 due to the large number of commercial off-the-shelf product that is available. Also, there are many configuration and diagnostic tools available by the same means. There are more than 300 vendors of DeviceNet product. Researchers at the University of Warwick have built a vehicle demonstrator using CAN/DeviceNet modules. This paper will illus- trate the ease of vehicle system integration utilising this popular technology. Some of benefits highlighted will be: Drastic reductions of installation times; Highly sophisticated, but simple, means of end-of-line testing; A radical improvement of diagnostics; Signifi- cant reduction of turnaround times for build changes for customer specifications. This paper focuses on the low quantity-build vehicle industries, e.g., agricultural machinery, buses, construction vehicles, military vehicles, sanitation vehicles, etc. Also a brief cost analysis of the system will be reviewed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0065.

(SP- 1594) Integration of a structuring concept for vehicle control systems into the software development pro- cess using UML modeling methods. P . Torre Flores, A. Lapp, W. Hermsen, J. Schirmer, and M. Walther, Robert Bosch GmbH; and T. Bertram, and J. Petersen, University of Duisburg. The demand for more security, economy, and comfort as well as for a reduced environmental impact increases the importance of electronic components for vehicles. The development of such sys- tems is determined by the requirement of an improved functionality and co-requisite the demand for limited costs. In order to fulfill these demands and taking into consideration the increase of complexity and the melting together to a car wide web, Bosch is developing a structuring concept called CARTRONIC®. This concept is supposed to be open and neutral regarding automotive manufactures and sup- pliers. The analysis of vehicle control systems via this method is based on formal rules for structuring and modelling. The function-related aspect of CARTRONIC® was represented already at the SAE'98 World Congress. Furthermore the safety-related feature was intro- duced in more detail at the SAE'99 World Congress. The result of the analysis is an object structure of logical compo- nents with defined interfaces. The mapping of these structure in the object oriented Unified Modeling Language (UML) completes the analysis phase of the software development. Thereby also dynamic aspects are considered. To reduce time and costs of the product development a continuous automated computer aided development process will be necessary. The paper describes the process summarised above using an example out of a global view of the powertrain functionalities. 2001-01-0067. Web-based vehicle remote access and its appli- cation to in-vehicle network integrated fleet management. Yongxi Ni and Christopher Nwagboso, University of Wolverhamp- ton ; and Jim Samuel, Dearborn Electronics (UK) Ltd. The demands for effective and efficient management of commer- cial vehicles and freight transport have led to the increasing needs for sophisticated fleet management systems (FMS) for reducing the operation cost of commercial vehicle operation, improving custom service and asset management as well as maintaining the safety and security. The availability and declining costs of telecommunications and information technologies afford opportunities for using real- time information to achieve these targets and the emergence of inter- net technology make it possible to transfer updated real-time infor- mation through more widely available communication media. This paper introduces the web-based remote-access concept for the real-time information acquisition, which has been used to enhance functionality of a dynamic fleet management system. When integrated with in-vehicle network, the information from other intel- ligent transport system (ITS) devices, along with vehicle electronic control modules, can be made available for a web-based remote fleet management system of vehicle fleet. The structure of an intelligent event engine has been proposed on the vehicle-side for monitoring and controlling of vehicle operations through the combination of web-based communication media and vehicle network technology. The implementation of the proposed method on a Truck System Concept Verifier has been used to demonstrate feasibility of the web-based remote access to enhance functionality of a dynamic FMS. 2001-01-0068. Dynamic message prioritization for its using fuzzy neural network technique. A. Zhang and C. Nwagboso, Uni- versity of Wolverhampton. The increasing number of electronic and communication devices used as part of Intelligent Transport System (ITS), brings with it an increasing importance for the employment of message prioritization technique within in-vehicle networks. As the integration of these devices increases within the vehicle network, there is a requirement for intelligence within the message prioritisation system. The ques- tion that arises is, under the increasing ITS nodes within vehicle net- works, how can the device messages be prioritized. Especially when there is an occurrence of incidents on-board or off-board the vehicle. Therefore, an incidence-based expert system is needed. This paper presents an intelligent message prioritization system using FNN (fuzzy neural network) techniques for deciding data priority. Such a system is aiming to provide message priority dynamically, espe- cially when a new device is introduced into an in-vehicle system network and when there is a prioritised incident. The application of FNN into the system results in many useful features. The suggested system is expected to be able to provide message prioritisation on any given incident or occasion. 2001-01-0069.

Tsui, University of Michigan. This paper describes a case study led by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) of Dayton, OH USA and Dear- born Group Inc. to prove the feasibility of employing Telematics technologies to the vehicle test and measurement industry. Many test functions can be automated through the use of secure wireless technologies. For example, vehicle data can be dynamically monitored on the vehicle and data meeting pre-determined criteria could be downloaded via the wireless communications center. Addi- tionally, central, real-time wireless monitoring of vehicle fleets pro- vides the vehicle fleet manager with the ability to manage multiple tests simultaneously, thus improving efficiencies and potentially reducing manpower costs and compressing test schedules. GPS enabled wireless systems also provide the vehicle engineer with insight of how test vehicles are driven, their location (whether the vehicles are staying within the prescribed test area), and what the effects are of altitude and terrain conditions on performance. 2001-01-0070. (SP- 1594) The application of low-cost CAN bus load transducer technology. C. P. Quigley and A. Roxburgh, Warwick Control Technologies Limited ; and K. H. Tang and R. T. McLaughlin, University of Warwick. A low-cost CAN bus load transducer, requiring only a few low- cost components, has been developed. Traditionally, to ascertain CAN bus loading, an algorithm based upon a number of assump- tions executed on a microcontroller is required. This has many dis- advantages that include being potentially costly, inaccurate and can take up a significant amount of processing, especially under higher bus load situations causing a higher number of interrupts. However, the CAN bus load transducer developed, is connected to the CAN bus and outputs a varying signal proportional to bus loading. A microcontroller can then simply be used to read the bus load signal and covert it into percentage bus loading as often as is required. The method is inexpensive, accurate and provides a continuous signal for CAN bus loading measurement that does not become expensive in terms of processing under higher bus load conditions. 11</page><page sequence="11">2001-01-0070-2001-01-0076 In this paper, the application of the CAN bus load transducer technology is explored. This includes applications using bus load such as data logging during control system development, on-line CAN bus diagnostics, CAN bus traffic control and distributed con- trol system feedback confidence analysis. However, the same tech- nology can be applied to additional applications not requiring bus load such as baud rate detection and frame scheduling analysis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0071. (SP- 1594) An investigation into the future of automotive in-vehicle control networking technology. C. P. Quigley , Warwick Control Technologies Limited ; and F. H. P. Tan , K. H. Tang , and R. T. McLaughlin , University of Warwick. The Controller Area Network (CAN) has seen enormous success in automotive body and powertrain control systems. However, there is a change in emphasis arising in the industry in which CAN is seen as too powerful and expensive for simple digital body control appli- cations, but not robust or fast enough for more safety critical appli- cations such as the envisaged Drive-by-Wire systems of future pas- senger cars. The emerging protocols Local Interconnect Network (LIN), the Time Triggered Protocols (TTP/A, TTP/C), Time Trig- gered CAN (TTC) and Byteflight are examined in terms of their application and likelihood for future success. The paper is con- cluded with comments concerning a newly announced protocol known as FlexRay. 2001-01-0072. (SP- 1594) LIN bus and its potential for use in distributed multiplex applications. John V. DeNuto, Stephen Ewbank, Francis Kleja , Christopher A. Lupini , and Robert A. Per- isho , Jr., Delphi Automotive Systems. The increasing features and complexity of today's automotive architectures are becoming increasingly difficult to manage. Each new innovation typically requires additional mechanical actuators and associated electrical controllers. The sheer number of black boxes and wiring are being limited not by features or cost but by the inability to physically assemble them into a vehicle. A new architecture is required which will support the ability to add new features but also enable the Vehicle Assembly Plants to easily assemble and test each subsystem. One such architecture is a distrib- uted multiplex arrangement that reduces the number of wires while enabling flexibility and expandability. Previous versions have had to deal with issues such as noise immunity at high switching cur- rents. The LIN Bus with its low cost and rail-to-rail capability may be the key enabling technology to make the multiplexed architecture a reality. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0073. (SP- 1594) Time-triggered CAN (TTCAN). Thomas Fuehrer , Bernd Mueller, Florian Hartwich, and Robert Hugel, Robert Bosch GmbH. Connecting microcontrollers, sensors and actuators by several communication systems is state of the art within the electronic archi- tectures of modern vehicles. The communication among these com- ponents is widely based on the event triggered communication on the Controller- Area-Network (CAN) protocol. The arbitrating mechanism of this protocol ensures that all messages are transferred according to the priority of their identifiers and that the message with the highest priority will not be disturbed. In the future some mission critical subnetworks within the upcoming generations of vehicle systems, e.g., x-by-wire systems (xbws), will additionally require deterministic behavior in communication during service. Even at maximum bus load, the transmission of all safety related messages must be guaranteed. Moreover it must be possible to determine the point of time when the message will be transmitted with high precision. One way to solve this issue using CAN is the extension of the standard CAN protocol to a time-triggered protocol TTCAN. The communication is based on the periodic transmission of a reference message by a time master. This allows to introduce a system wide global network time with high precision. Based on this time the dif- ferent messages are assigned to time windows within a basic cycle. A big advantage of TTCAN compared to classic scheduled systems is the possibility to transmit event triggered messages in certain "ar- bitrating" time windows as well. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0074. (SP- 1594) Hardware independent software framework for in-vehicle information systems. Hass Machlab, James C. Griffin, Jr., Ron E. Stahlberg, and Greg A. Dils, Diversi- fied Software Industries, Inc. New technologies are being incorporated into vehicles more rap- idly then ever before. These products require a display to present information, and a reliable in-vehicle network to communicate. Speed to market is critical. In order to compete, manufacturers, sup- pliers and third-party developers must have a dynamic, robust test- ing and development environment for these products. Any inte- grated environment must facilitate easy creation and on-going sup- port of devices that interface with in-vehicle networks and digital displays. Such devices will shape the future of transportation. The In- Vehicle Information System (I VIS) framework allows vehicle manufacturers to integrate, test, and maintain on-board information systems. A new system is assembled from software and hardware components, interconnected using desktop graphical design tools, and tested in both simulated and bench environments. 2001-01-0075. (SP- 1594) Diagnostic and control systems for automotive power electronics. Stefan Mueller and Wolfgang Troeger, Infineon Technologies AG. The recent improvements in automotive electronics have had a tremendous impact on safety, comfort and emissions. But the con- tinuous increase of the volume of electronic equipment in cars (rep- resenting more than 25% of purchasing volume) as well as the increasing system complexity represent a new challenge to quality, post-sales customer support and maintenance. Identifying a fault in a complex network of ECUs, where the different functions are get- ting more and more intricate, is not an easy task. It can be shown that with the levels of reliability common in 1980, an upper-range automobile of today could never function fault-free. On-Board- Diagnostics (OBD) concepts are emerging to assist the maintenance personnel in localizing the source of a problem with high accuracy, reducing the vehicle repair time, repair costs and costs of warranty claims. Further benefits are an early warning to the driver, who can then take corrective measures Based on network and system models and learning algorithms, microcontrollers are taking over diagnostics, failure identification and even prevention. Software incorporates all the rules for acting and reacting to the system status and providing limp home function- ality wherever possible. In order to reliably and identify a failure, more detailed status information on the network and the individual nodes is needed. Potential causes for failures, such as overvoltage, overtemperature, overcurrent, etc., need to be monitored to prevent damage. When a fault occurs to be identified accurately and signaled to the system's brain with minimal latency. Sensing the relevant sig- nals and physical parameters, though, adds to the system costs and complexity. Recent advances in smart power semiconductors open new ways of integrating the diagnostics functions needed for signal sensing, communication and self-protection in a very cost-efficient way. This paper discusses the actual situation and advanced possi- bilities of diagnostic and control functions in Automotive Power Electronics and shows how smart technologies and architectures can efficiently contribute to improve reliability, quality and safety of passenger cars. 2001-01-0076.

Robert Koehr, Porsche Engineering Services, Inc. 12</page><page sequence="12">2001-01-0076-2001-01-0082 Following the success of the UltraLight Steel Auto Body (ULSAB) in 1997, the UltraLight Steel Auto Closure (ULSAC) Consortium representing steel producers from all over the world was founded. Porsche Engineering Services, Inc., (PES) was commis- sioned to conduct a concept study for the development of UltraLight Steel Auto Closure concept designs for all types of automotive clo- sures that were structurally sound at affordable cost. The Validation Phase began in November 1998. In spring 2000, the ULSAC DH Door Structures featuring stamped Door Outer Pan- els were built and tested for structural performance, dent resistance and oil canning. The tested doors show state-of-the-art structural performance compared to today's frameless door structures, and the mass reduction ranges from 22 to 42% compared to the normalized mass of benchmarked doors. In the Validation Phase, a cost model was developed and the cost to produce the ULSAC frameless door structure was calculated. The results of this cost estimation show that the ULSAC door can be manufactured in high- volume produc- tion with no cost penalty. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0077.

The aim of this paper is to compare how hot-dip pure zinc- galvanized and iron-zinc galvannealed-coated steel sheets can fit the car industry requirements and to illustrate the metallurgical features responsible for their particular behaviors. Metallurgical routings for the elaboration of these coatings are first compared and their differences in microstructure are pointed out. Relationships between their microstructures and their behaviors at the customer plant during press-forming, welding, phosphating and ED-painting are discussed and compared. End users properties like paint appearance, paint adhesion and corrosion resistance are also compared and related to the coating microstructures. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0078. (SP-1614) High strength steels for automotive safety parts. D. Cornette, T. Hourman, O. Hudin, J. P. Laurent , and A. Reynaert, Usinor Research . Energy savings are among the most important goals of steel users. Usinor proposes a wide range of very high strength steels (HSLA, DP, TRIP, etc.) for weight reduction and impact resistance. This text deals with the mechanical testing and different design solu- tions associated with these steel grades. Tensile and formability properties are presented first by means of basic tests (drawing, stretching, bending, etc.) in order to classify the different steels. A specific part of the text deals with a ultra-high tensile strength pre- coated boron steel for hot forming. In addition to this, the crash resistance is investigated by using a dynamic axial compression test and a dynamic three-point bending test on structural components with closed and open cross sections. For each steel grade, the esti- mated weight saving potential is compared with respect to parts manufactured in high drawability steel. Finally, two different designs are presented with steel solutions for safety parts. The first one shows the advantage of the use of TRIP steel and a hydroform- ing technique for a crash box instead of using a conventional form- ing technique. The second one deals with the design of a cross fron- tal sill with a complex cross section, formed using a profile rolling technique. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0079. (SP-1614) Formability and performance of steel-plastic-steel laminated sheet materials. Todd M. Link , U. S. Steel Research. Steel-plastic-steel (SPS) laminated sheet materials can be uti- lized in certain automotive applications to achieve significant weight savings over "conventional" sheet steels. Three SPS lami- nates were produced using various combinations of light gage steel skins and polypropylene cores. Compared to homogeneous steels, density reductions of 35 to 46 percent were achieved. Benefiting from the ductility of their steel skins, SPS laminates can posses ade- quate formability for typical automotive sheet applications. Further- more, the forming limit curves can be predicted using the work hard- ening exponent and thickness of the composite laminate. In three- point bending, the elastic stiffness of SPS laminates is nearly equiv- alent to that of monolithic steels of the same thickness. Thus, weight reductions similar to those of aluminum alloys can be achieved uti- lizing laminates in stiffness-critical applications. The quasi-static dent resistance of SPS laminates is improved by increasing the plas- tic core thickness, by increasing the steel skin strength, and by utiliz- ing bake hardenable steel skins. These results provide an indication of the suitability of SPS laminates for potential use in automotive applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0080. (SP-1614) Influence of dry film lubricant on press formability of steel sheets. Kazuhiko Hi gai, Sachiko Suzuki , Shigeru U mino, Kazuo Mochizuki, and Chiaki Kato , Kawasaki Steel Corp. We have developed a new dry film lubricant with friction proper- ties superior to those of conventional dry film lubricants by optimiz- ing the glass transition temperature of the binder resin and adding polyethylene wax and inorganic lubricants. As described in this paper, the new dry film lubricant was applied as a coating on hot- rolled steel sheets and galvannealed steel sheets in thicknesses rang- ing from 1 .5 to 2.5 pm. The influence of the dry film lubricant and a rust preventive lubricant oil on the press formability of these steel sheets was investigated. A comparison of the press formability of high-strength steel sheets with the dry film lubricant and sheets with the rust preventive lubricating oil suggested that application of the new dry film lubricant expands the use of high-strength steel sheets and galvannealed steel sheets in automotive body panels. Further- more, these steel sheets with the dry film lubricant showed the same alkaline degreasability, phosphatability and spot weldability as steel sheets with rust preventive lubricating oil. These results suggested also that steel sheets with the dry film lubricant can be used widely in automotive body panels. 2001-01-0081. (SP-1614) New friction model for sheet metal- forming. Gregory Dalton , TribSys Inc. Much effort has been spent optimizing sheet surface roughness for improved pressworking performance. However, comparatively little attention has been given to the problems associated with stamping coated steel sheets. It has been assumed that the surface roughness of the substrate dominates. Consequently, problems with sheet coatings have been mainly addressed on the press shop floor with lubricants and die surface treatments. An extensive study on the effects of lubricants and lubricant additives on zinc-coated sheet revealed anomalous behavior particu- larly with the soft zinc coatings that could not be readily explained with tribological theory, namely Coulomb friction and the Stribeck curve. A later study examined the effects of lubricant weight on press performance with various zinc-coated steels. Once again ano- malies appeared that were repeatable yet defied explanation. This paper examines these anomalies and proposes an explana- tion for differences in stamping performance of zinc-coated sheet. A model of the sheet surface is presented to support this explanation. This model combines sheet roughness, sheet hardness, and dynamic fill volume as factors to consider. Conclusions are made with respect to the application of this model, and future work is outlined. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0082. (SP-1614) Effects of pre-strain on properties of low-carbon sheet steels tested over a wide range of strain rates. Mareio Milititsky , David K. Matlock , and John G. Speer, Colorado School of Mines ; and Carl M. Cady, and Martin C. Mataya, Los Alamos National Laboratory. 13</page><page sequence="13">2001-01-0082-2001-01-0091 Knowledge of high strain-rate deformation behavior of automo- tive body structural materials is of importance for design of new vehicles with improved crash-energy management characteristics. Since a large range of plastic strains is encountered during the form- ing process prior to assembly, the mechanical behavior of sheet steels under high strain rate deformation conditions must be under- stood after pre-straining, in addition to the as-produced condition. This paper presents the compression testing methodology employed to examine these properties, and focuses on the effects of quasi- static pre-strains (from 0 to 20%) on the subsequent behavior of a low carbon interstitial free steel tested over a broad range of strain rates (from 10~2 to lOV1). The results suggest that the increase in yield stress associated with increasing strain rate is not substantially influenced by prior cold work. The work hardening rate is strongly influenced by strain rate, however, and this occurrence is attributed to a combination of 1) thermal softening due to adiabatic heating, and 2) a likely change in dislocation interactions resulting from high rate deformation. The combined effects of forming strains and adia- batic heating diminish work hardening rate to a greater extent at high strain rates. The implications of these results are also discussed. 2001-01-0083. (SP-1614) Effect of forming strain on fatigue performance of a mild automotive steel. Benda Yan , Ispat Inland Inc.; and Paul Belanger and Ken Citrin, DaimlerChrysler Corp. The effect of forming strains on the fatigue behavior of an auto- motive mild steel, interstitial free steel, was studied after being pre- strained by balanced biaxial stretch and plane strain. In the long life region, higher than 5xl05 reversals, prestrain improves fatigue resis- tance. In the short life region, prestrain reduces fatigue resistance. At even shorter fatigue lives, the detrimental effect of prestrain diminishes. For plane strains, the fatigue behavior is anisotropic. In the direction perpendicular to the major strain, the steel exhibits much better fatigue resistance than in the direction parallel to the major strain. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0084. (SP-1614) The role of "cratering" in the pro- cessing and properties of galvannealed steel sheet. Peter M. Hale and Roger N. Wright, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and Frank E. Goodwin, International Lead Zinc Research Organization. Craters in galvannealed coatings on steel sheet are depressions caused by non-uniform diffusive growth. Correlations have been sought between "crater" densities in galvannealed sheet steel and friction, powdering, and paint adherence, as relevant to the appear- ance, corrosion resistance and processing of auto body panels. Cra- ter densities were established on a series of samplings from major producers, and related to frictional measurements from a binder- radius simulator, powdering levels from bend testing, and paint adherence assessments from a stone-chipping test. Results suggest that increased crater density decreases powdering, but does not aid in lubrication. In fact, decreased powdering could be correlated with increased friction levels. A strong correlation was found between increased crater density and increased paint adherence. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0085. (SP- 1621) An experimental and analytical study of the fatigue life of weldments with longitudinal attach- ments. S. D. Dimitrakis, Parsons Brinckerhoff, Inc. ; and F. V. Law- rence, University of Illinois. Both the experimental results and the analytical predictions of this study confirm that the poor fatigue performance of weldments with longitudinal attachments is due to poor weld quality which in turn leads to either a cold-lap or a very small weld toe radius, as well as to the combination of a very high 3-D stress concentration, and very high tensile residual stresses. Consequently, a specially designed stress-concentration-reducing part termed "stress diffuser" incorporated in the wrap-around welds at the ends of the longitudi- nal attachments increased the fatigue strength of longitudinal attach- ments to equal that of transverse attachments but only when cold- laps were eliminated. The fatigue life predictions made using the a two-stage Initiation- Propagation (IP) model were in good agreement with the experi- mental results. Procedures for correcting for the curved shape of the crack path are investigated. Cold-lap defects were predicted to elim- inate the fatigue crack initiation life but to affect very little the fatigue crack propagation life. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0086. (SP- 1621) A robust structural stress procedure for characterizing fatigue behavior of welded joints. Pingsha Dong, Battelle, Columbus. This paper summarizes some recent results on fatigue evaluation of welded joints. A mesh-insensitive structural stress procedure was discussed and employed to characterize geometric stress raiser effects at welded joints. Existing weld fatigue data published in the open literature were analyzed using the structural stress parameter. Even though the fatigue data were from various industries, materi- als, and gauge thicknesses, the structural stress based interpretation of the existing data has demonstrated the following: (1) The mesh- insensitive structural stresses serve as an effective stress parameter to correlate fatigue S-N data and provide the data transferability between various joint types (2) The large number of weld S-N curves classified per joint type with the current weld category based approach can be significantly reduced, for instance, potentially to a single curve for weld toe failure. (3) Such a structural stress parameter can be effectively used to gain insight on fatigue behavior of welded joints. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0090.

Christy, ALCAN Kingston Research and Development Center ; and J. A. Clarke, ALCAN Global Automotive Products. The present work investigates weld failure modes during forma- bility tests of multi-gauge aluminum Tailor- Welded Blanks (TWBs). The limiting dome height test is used to evaluate forma- bility of TWBs. Three gauge combinations utilizing aluminum alloy 5754 sheets are considered (2 to 1 mm, 1.6 to 1 mm and 2 to 1.6 mm). Three weld orientations have been considered: transverse, lon- gitudinal and 45°. Interaction of several factors determines the type of failure that occurs in a TWB specimen. These factors are weld orientation, morphology and distribution of weld defects, and the magnitude of constraint imposed by the thicker sheet to the thin sheet. The last factor depends on the difference in thickness of the sheet pair and is usually expressed in terms of gauge ratio. In general TWBs show two different types of fracture: weld failure and failure of the thin aluminum sheet. Only the former will be discussed in this paper. Both optical and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used during the study of failure initiation and damage in the weld region of TWBs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0091.

In this paper, the formability of AA5754 aluminum laser-welded blanks produced by Nd:YAG laser welding is investigated under biaxial straining conditions. The mechanical behavior of the laser- welded blanks is first examined by uniaxial tensile tests conducted with the weld line perpendicular to the tensile axis. Shear failure in the weld metal is observed in the experiments. Finite element simu- lations under generalized plane strain conditions are then conducted in order to further understand the effects of weld geometry and strength on the shear failure and formability of these welded blanks. The strain histories of the material elements in the weld metal obtained from finite element computations are finally used in a theo- retical failure analysis based on the material imperfection approach 14</page><page sequence="14">2001-01-0091-2001-01-0101 to predict the failure strains for the laser- welded blanks under biax- ial straining conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0092. (SP- 1621) Deformation mode analysis of form- ing limit diagrams for tailor-welded blanks. S. M. Chan , L C. Chan, and T. C. Lee, Hong Kong Polytechnic Univ. This paper presents an analysis of deformation modes of Form- ing Limit Diagrams (FLDs) for tailor- welded blanks (TWBs) through designed experiments. Cold rolled steel sheets of different thickness combinations are used in this study. One-step forming of TWBs has the advantage of cost reduction and body weight reduc- tion. Recently, TWBs are being commonly used in car-body panel manufacturing. Most of the previous research work focused only on the effects of laser welding parameters and material properties on the formability of the TWB. However, effects on the FLDs of TWBs are still uncertain. For this reason, a kick-off study on the analysis of different thickness combinations of 0.7mm, 0.8mm and 1.0mm steel sheets was carried out after butt- welding by Nd-YAG laser. Circular grid patterns were printed on the surface of specimens for different testing, like tensile testing and Swift Round-bottom test- ing. The experimental results show that the FLCs of TWBs are lower than those of base metals which indicates that TWBs have a lower formability than base metal. For TWBs with larger thickness combination difference, the failure occurred at the lower major strain Ei value, which implies that they have a lower formability. Hence, the FLD of TWBs should be beneficial to car-body panel manufacturing industry. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0093.

(SP-1575) Correlating stressed environmental testing of structural composites to service. S. George Luckey, Jr. and Dan Q. Houston, Ford Motor Co.; John M. Henshaw, Univer- sity of Tulsa ; and Ed M. Hagerman, General Motors Corp. A compact in-situ tensile stress fixture was designed for the study of the combined effects of stress and automotive environments on structural glass fiber-reinforced composite materials. With this fixture, a standardized 300-hour laboratory screening test was devel- oped to compare the residual property loss of composite materials due to concurrent exposure to stress and environment. It is of great importance that the data gathered in the laboratory have correlation to on-vehicle (in-service) performance, and that both lab and real- world data be taken with a test system (in-situ test fixtures) capable of providing accurate and consistent results under either test condi- tion. For the correlation of the 300-hour screening test results of a P4 (programmable powdered preform process) chopped-glass-fiber material to actual vehicle service conditions, stressed (within fix- ture) and unstressed tensile samples of P4 chopped-glass-fiber auto- motive structural composite were placed on a semi-truck for one year. The stressed composite specimens were loaded to 25% of the ultimate strength of the material. During that year, the truck logged over 100,000 miles, experienced all four weather seasons, and trav- eled through every region of the contiguous United States. Further in-situ fixture durability testing of the chopped-glass composite was conducted on the roof of a laboratory located in Dearborn, Michigan for one year. The on-roof test was conducted to investigate the influ- ences of environment, stress, and UV exposure. With one exception (rooftop modulus), the on-vehicle and rooftop durability tests showed no significant change in tensile properties in either the stressed or unstressed specimens when compared to material base- line tensile properties. Furthermore, the two one year durability tests indicated slightly less degradation than observed for the 300-hour screening test results of the chopped-glass-fiber composite. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0098. High consistency glass mat reinforced thermo- plastic (GMT): Thin wall structural applications with surface requirements. Charles W. Peterson, Azdel bv; Dennis O. Spencer, Azdel Inc.; and Jonathan Rosin and Enamul Haque, Azdel Inc. Glass fiber mat reinforced thermoplastics (GMT) are now able to be designed for lightweight applications with lower than ever before wall thicknesses and high surface finish. This is made possi- ble as result of new material developments using the Azdel chopped fiber technology. Highly isotropic in-plane material properties are now attainable over very long material flow trajectories in combina- tion with the thinnest wall sections. This breakthrough has been enabled by an economical method to maximize the macroscopic fiber-fiber interaction, without loss of mechanical, flow and other performance properties. Further, the fiber content and part weight distribution capability are of the highest quality available, further ensuring that molders and OEMs may design reliably at the lowest part weight. 2001-01-0100. Development of low density glass mat thermo- plastic composites for structural applications. Venkat Raghaven- dran and Enamul Haque, AZDEL, Inc. The need for a lightweight, fuel efficient automobile that is envi- ronmentally friendly and affordable has spurred a lot of develop- ment in the field of composites. Composites made from lightweight thermoplastics, glass and carbon fibers or low density metal alloys inherently fit the industry requirements. Glass Mat Thermoplastic (GMT) composites made from continuous strand or chopped glass fiber web have been used for over two decades in automotive struc- tural applications like bumper beams, skid plates, running boards, etc. Typically GMT weighs 4 to 5 Kg/m2 and are flow molded in a compression press. A low density, lightweight GMT composite containing long chopped fiber strands was developed by AZDEL, Inc., for use in headliner and other automotive interior applications. The low density GMT weighs between 0.5 to 2Kg/m2. This paper presents further development of the low density GMT for automotive structural applications. This new thermoformable material has several advantages over other traditional materials like steel and thermoset composites. The low density GMT offers design flexibility, low weight, high rigidity, excellent energy absorption characteristics, faster cycle times and an environmentally friendly manufacturing process. The design flexibility and application of these low density GMT composites in automotive industry and the advantages of applying these composites over the other materials in structural and modular applications will be discussed. 2001-01-0101. (SP-1575) A new level of performance is reached with fabric reinforced glass mat thermoplastics. Ronnie Törnqvist, Symalit AG. This paper concentrates on the current potential and new devel- opments of Glass fiber Mat reinforced Thermoplastics (GMT). It is illustrated through examples of applications where an improved per- formance to cost balance of the system has been obtained through the use of new GMT materials. The latest material developments have resulted in higher material properties and more possibilities in the design of parts. Combina- tions between local fabric reinforcements and a higher glass fiber content in GMT has enabled the use of the material in structurally very demanding parts. In this area, great savings of both cost and weight can be achieved through the use of GMT in the place of alu- minum or steel. 15</page><page sequence="15">2001-01-0101-2001-01-0116 Special versions of the material have been developed which have resulted in an improved surface quality, colored products, tempera- ture resistant and flame retardant grades. The use of natural fibers instead of glass result in "green materials" and have advantages to GMT in terms of a lower density and better sound absorbing proper- ties. Common for all these new types of materials is that they can be processed on traditional GMT (and SMC) equipment. The flow molding process allows complex shaped parts to be produced in short cycle times, this combination often results in an advantageous system cost. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0102.

Several possibilities are available to decrease the mass of an exhaust system, thus contributing to a reduced fuel consumption of the vehicles. The use of cost competitive composites is possible thanks to a side-branch layout of a Helmholtz resonator, allowing for lower gas temperatures. Special attention is paid to the material itself, in order to avoid noise radiation and to reach durability tar- gets, and to the manufacturing process.

(SP-1575) A novel use of a composite material to limit the loads in windshield wiper systems. James P. Penrod , Yaomin Dong , and H. Charles Buchanan , Valeo Wiper Systems. Using a thermoset polyester/glass fiber pultruded composite material, and taking advantage of column post-buckling behavior, a rigid/perfectly-plastic member can be approximated. Employment of the composite material is essential to realize an appreciable reduction in length of the member, while staying within the elastic range of the material. Utilizing this member as the connecting rod of 4-bar linkages found in automotive windshield wiping systems can limit the peak system loading occurring as a result of snow/ice pack above the cowl screen. This technology holds the potential for reliability, wipe quality, and cost improvement along with mass reduction in windshield wiping systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0105. (SP-1575) An innovative processing answer for low cost and high performance polymer composites. Philippe Dumazet, Marie-Pierre Buron , and Yohan Vallet, Faurecia Indus- tries. Thermoplastic composites are well adapted to fit the require- ments of the automotive industry (low density, short cycle time, good recycling). In order to broaden their fields of applications, sev- eral developments have been performed to obtain economical and versatile process. Both economical and versatility targets are reached with the "one shot" extrusion-compression molding process XRE™ developed by FAURECIA. This process allows the combination of any kind of thermoplastic resin with a wide range of fibers, additives or fillers tailored to attempt the product profile of the parts. This patented pro- cess is already used by FAURECIA for the industrial production of the front-end of the Peugeot 206. 2001-01-0106.

The subject of this paper is centered on ongoing Common Soft- ware Architecture for Ground-based Military Vehicle Systems dis- sertation research at Naval Postgraduate School. It is through data research, simulation and evaluation of architecture models that today's Crusader Combat Vehicle Program's RTCOE (Real-time Common Operating Environment) Software Architecture can be made THE BEST common software architecture model for all Com- bat, Tactical and Utility Ground-based Military Vehicle Systems with critical, real-time modifications and technological guideline recommendations . 2001-01-0110. (SP-1587) Software development for multiple OEMs using tool configured middleware for CAN communica- tion. Pascal Jost , University of Stuttgart; and Stephan Hoffmann, Vector CANtech Inc. Years ago car manufacturers started using reusable software components for the development of ECU applications. As commu- nication between ECUs is not a competitive advantage, there has been a lot of standardization efforts, especially in Europe. Whereas the standards for Operating Systems and Network Managements are widely accepted and used, all major OEMs created their own ver- sions of Communication Modules, which presents a major road- block for OEM independent ECU development. We show how the OEM specifics can be hidden by using a tool configured middleware. 2001-01-0115. (SP- 1596) An assessment of narrow object frontal impact calculation methods. Steven E. Meyer, Joshua D. Hay den, and Stephen Forrest, Safety Analysis &amp; Forensic Engineer- ing (SAFE). This paper evaluates the historical array of available methodolo- gies for analysis of narrow object frontal impacts and addresses each method's accuracy in determining collision characteristics. Several previously reported methods spanning the last 25 years of research are considered and each method's assumptions are examined in assessing impact speed, change in velocity and/or equivalent barrier speed as compared to crash test data. Those methods that have become technologically dated are discussed. Analytical methods are recommended which are proven to demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in predicting collision characteristics of narrow object frontal impacts. Comparison of each method's analytical predictions leads to a discussion of potential errors and/or limitations of the var- ious analytical models. Recommendations are made based upon cur- rently available crash test data. Finally, a real-world accident sce- nario is presented in which evaluation of such a collision is consid- ered utilizing each of the aforementioned methodologies and results are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0116. (SP-1596) Vehicle seating - An overview of how advanced airbag regulations will effect non-FMVSS test procedures. P. Michael Miller and Suzanne Phillips, MGA Research Corp. Recently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) revised the Final Rule for Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS 208) - Occupant Crash Protection. This rule, which will first take effect during the 2004 model year, specifies a number of new compliance test requirements that advanced frontal 16</page><page sequence="16">2001-01-01 16-2001-01-0122 protection airbags will have to meet. The goal of the new standard is to reduce the risk of serious airbag induced injuries, particularly for small women and young children, and provide improved frontal crash protection for all occupants. In response to this new rule, vehicles in the future will have elec- tronic sensors located in the seat and other advanced sensor systems. These sensors will be designed to measure critical data, such as occupant weight and size, which will be used to control the airbag. The reliability of the sensors through the entire life of a vehicle is critical to its overall safety characteristics. Tests that were con- ducted in the past strictly for quality evaluation, are now being done for safety-related reasons. The use of durability tests to ensure the reliability of a particular safety feature has resulted in the develop- ment of enhanced durability evaluations and "in-plant" or produc- tion test and calibration procedures. This paper will provide a general overview of changes in the non- FMVSS testing field as a result of new airbag regulations. As safety systems are designed with more complex electronic components, changes will have to be made to testing practices to ensure reliability of the system through the entire life of a vehicle. Readers of this paper will gain a much broader understanding of the effects that new airbag regulations will have on testing practices intended to evaluate the reliability and durability of safety-related vehicle components. 2001-01-0117. (SP-1596) Improved ATD positioning proce- dures. Matthew P. Reed , Miriam A. Manary, Carol A. C. Flanna- gan, and Lawrence W. Schneider , University of Michigan Transpor- tation Research Institute; and Raul A. Arbalaez, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . Current anthropomorphic test device (ATD) positioning proce- dures for drivers and front-seat passengers place the crash dummy within the vehicle by reference to the seat track. Midsize-male ATDs are placed at the center of the fore-aft seat track adjustment range, while small-female and large-male ATDs are placed at the front and rear of the seat track, respectively. Research on occupant positioning at UMTRI led to the development of a new ATD posi- tioning procedure that places the ATDs at positions more represen- tative of the driving positions of people who match the ATD' s body dimensions. This paper presents a revised version of the UMTRI ATD positioning procedure. The changes to the procedure improve the ease and repeatability of ATD positioning while preserving the accuracy of the resulting ATD positions with respect to the driving positions of people matching the ATD anthropometry. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0118. (SP-1596) Displacement measurements in the Hybrid IU chest. Jonathan Butcher, Greg Shaw, Cameron Bass, Richard Kent, and Jeff Crandall, University of Virginia. This paper presents an analysis of the displacement measurement of the Hybrid III 50th percentile male dummy chest in quasistatic and dynamic loading environments. In this dummy, the sternal chest deformation is typically characterized using a sliding chest potenti- ometer, originally designed to measure inward deflection in the cen- tral axis of the dummy chest. Loading environments that include other modes of deformation, such as lateral translations or rotations, can create a displacement vector that is not aligned with this sensi- tive axis. To demonstrate this, the dummy chest was loaded qua- sistatically and dynamically in a series of tests. A string potentiome- ter array, with the capability to monitor additional deflection modes, was used to supplement the measurement of the chest slider. Results indicated that the Hybrid III chest behaved in a rigid manner in fron- tal crash environments, but in a less rigid manner when denuded of its skin and subjected to highly localized quasistatic deflections. Chest slider measurements deviated from those of the supplemental instrumentation in loading environments where the upper chest received the maximum deflection. This indicates that the chest slider may not accurately characterize the motion of the sternum when lat- eral translations and rotations occur, and therefore its data cannot be interpreted correctly. Further, the differences in local and sternal slider measurements are discussed for typical air bag and seat belt thoracic loading for both drivers and passengers in automobile crashes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0119. (SP-1596) The studies of crash characteristics according to chassis frame types. Cheon-Hong Jeong, Nak-Seung Jung, In-Ho Choi, and Seog-Ju Cha, Hyundai Motor Co. There are various tests for evaluating how well a vehicle protects people in a crash. The frontal and offset crash test is one of the most important tests that evaluate the crashworthiness of a vehicle. In this paper, we will discuss some parameters that have a major effect on the amount and pattern of intrusion into the occupant compartment during the frontal and offset crash test. And the characteristics of impact are described according to the types of chassis frame, T-type frame and #-type frame. The T-frame has worse performance than #-frame in crash, so it is necessary to make stronger dash compart- ments in T-frame. We will design a vehicle which has optimized body, chassis structure and material selections by controlling major parameters of frontal crash performance. 2001-01-0121. (SP-1596) A headform development for neck calibrating tests of the SID-IIs side impact dummy. Youmei Zhao, Michael J. Salloum, Sarath Kottur, Steve Moss, and Joshua Y. Zhu, First Technology Safety Systems. The SID-IIs side impact dummy is a newly designed dummy as an anthropomorphic test device for small-size person to be used in side impact crash testing. The head and neck are one of the key com- ponents for SID-IIs dummy designing, manufacturing, and testing. This paper is focused on the development of a Headform to be used for neck calibration of the SID-IIs side impact dummy. It will be very difficult in neck calibration measurement of the SID-IIs dummy if its head is used for the test directly. The Head- form is one of the methods to solve this problem. However, the Headform must be consistent in achieving equivalent functional per- formance as the dummy head and associated physical properties. A 3-D head model has been developed for obtaining initial basic infor- mation. The offset can be controlled within 3% during the engineer- ing design of the Headform. The neck dynamic test has been done before the Headform test. The neck movement has also been analyzed by using the high-speed video system at testing. More tests have been conducted to evaluate the Headform performance at various calibration laboratories. Test results indicated that the performance of the Headform is consistent with the design concept of SID-IIs Headform. Based on the test results analysis, the new Headform has yielded stable and repeatable results to match the calibration requirements. The Headform can therefore be used for the neck calibrating tests of the SID-IIs side impact dummy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0122. (SP-1596) Side impact structural characteriza- tion from FMVSS 214D test data. Donald E. Struble and Kevin J. Welsh, Struble -Welsh Engineering; and John D. Struble, Georgia Institute of Technology. Due to the upgrade of FMVSS 214 and the emergence of side NCAP tests, there is a growing body of crash test data on vehicle side structures. Such data would be very useful to reconstructionists, except that the struck vehicle behavior is masked, in part, by the use of a deformable moving barrier in the test. The post-impact dynam- ics and the energy absorption by the barrier itself must be accounted for if the desired vehicle structural characterization is to be extracted. Attempts prior to this paper to achieve a side structure character- ization have dealt with these issues by invoking various simplifying assumptions. Unfortunately, these have not been supported by a foundation in either physics or measurement. Questions have also been raised whether prior characterizations of the barrier face are 17</page><page sequence="17">2001-01-0122-2001-01-0137 appropriate, in view of the prior crash modes being so unlike the FMVSS 214 test. To address these issues, crash tests of the barrier itself, in an appropriate crash mode, have been conducted. The properties of the barrier face in this mode have been determined. The paper shows how to use those properties, in combination with results from crabbed moving deformable barrier tests, to extract the structural characteristics of the side-struck vehicles. Such characteristics are presented for 43 vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0123. (SP- 1596) Child restraint durability in high- speed crashes. Susan L. Meyerson and Adrian K. Lund, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety installed a variety of infant, toddler, and booster restraints in vehicles subjected to high- speed frontal offset crash tests to assess the effects of severe crashes on the structural integrity of the restraints and their associated hard- ware (harnesses, buckles, clips, etc.). The child restraints were inspected before and after each test, and all damage was recorded. In some of the tests, forces and accelerations were recorded on the appropriate size child dummy properly secured in the child restraint. After a single severe crash, most restraints had sustained some dam- age, albeit minimal. Repeated tests indicated that these child restraints could withstand the forces of an additional crash with only minor additional damage. Dummy injury results suggest that current injury risk curves overstate the risk of neck injury to most properly restrained children. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0125.

Rollover propensity evaluation of an SUV equipped with a TRW VSC system. Ali Y. Ungoren and Huei Peng, University of Michigan; and Danny R. Milot, TRW Inc. In this paper, a simulation-based dynamic rollover evaluation procedure is described. This work is based on the worst-case meth- odology developed at the University of Michigan, and is the result of a collaborated research project between the University of Michi- gan and TRW Inc. The target vehicle studied in this paper is a large production volume SUV. This vehicle is equipped with a produc- tion-intent TRW Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system. The main goals of this paper are to (i) study the rollover propensity of this SUV, as influenced by vehicle and environment parameters such as vehicle speed, road condition, etc.; and (ii) investigate whether, and by how much, does the VSC system influence the rollover propen- sity of this SUV. The modeling, evaluation procedure, and prelimi- nary evaluation results are reported. 2001-01-0131. Results from NHTSA's experimental exami- nation of selected maneuvers that may induce on-road untrip- ped, light vehicle rollover. W. Riley Garrott, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; J. Gavin Howe, Transportation Research Center, Ine ; and Garrick Forkenbrock, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper summarizes the results of test maneuvers devised to measure on-road, untripped, rollover propensity. Complete findings from this research are contained. Twelve test vehicles, representing a wide range of vehicle types and classes were used. Three vehicles from each of four categories: passenger cars, light trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles, were tested. The vehicles were tested with vehicle characterization and untripped rollover propensity maneuvers. The vehicle characteriza- tion maneuvers were designed to determine fundamental vehicle handling properties while the untripped rollover propensity maneu- vers were designed to produce two-wheel lift for vehicles with rela- tively higher rollover propensity potential. The vehicle characteriza- tion maneuvers were Pulse Steer, Sinusoidal Sweep, Slowly Increasing Steer, and Slowly Increasing Speed. The rollover propen- sity maneuvers were J-Turn, J-Turn with Pulse Braking, Fishhook #1 and #2, and Resonant Steer. The degree of two-wheel lift produced for each vehicle/ maneuver/steer direction combination was given a score based on whether the lift was minor, moderate, or major. No two-wheel lift was given a zero score. The individual vehicle/maneuver/steer direction scores were combined to produce two ratings: a Steering Maneuver Score and a Pulse Braking Score. The Steering Maneuver Score was based on J-Turn, Fishhook #1, and Fishhook #2 results, while the Pulse Braking Score was based on J-Turn with Pulse Brak- ing results. The Steering Maneuver Scores were found to be related to the rollover stability metrics of the vehicles. The Pulse Braking Score was related more to whether the vehicle was equipped with a four- wheel antilock brake system (4WAL) or not. For those vehicles without 4WAL, the Pulse Braking score related to the rollover sta- bility metrics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0133. (SP- 1602) Passenger car stability under ran- dom wind excitation. Walid A. H. Oraby, University of Helwan; and David A. Crolla, University of Leeds. The directional stability properties of passenger cars under high- speed, straight running conditions form a major contributory factor in overall subjective ratings of vehicle handling, comfort and drivea- bility. The aim of the paper is to investigate the links between straight running properties under random wind loading and vehicle design parameters. A linear, three-degree-of-freedom vehicle model was selected, to which a simple driver model could be incorporated as necessary. The wind loading excitation was modeled using a quasi-static approach, involving a randomly varying side wind with statistical properties taken from existing literature. The response properties of the vehicle with and without driver were characterized by perfor- mance indices such as root mean square values of vehicle motions. Finally, these results were analyzed to search for correlation between the performance indices and vehicle chassis design features such as tires, steering system and suspension kinematics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0137. (SP- 1602) Development of vehicle stability control system based on vehicle sideslip angle estimation. Akitaka Nishio and Kenji Tozu, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd.; and Hiroyuki Yamaguchi, Katsuhiro Asano, and Yasushi Amano, Toyota Central R&amp;D Laboratory, Inc. For the vehicle stability control system, which improves vehicle yaw stability for limit driving condition, accurate vehicle sideslip angle detection is one of key issues to confirm the system perfor- mance. In this paper, an estimation method of vehicle sideslip angle is described. It is necessary that the vehicle sideslip angle estimation must be robust against road surface condition change, road bank, sensor error, brake force effect, driver's operation and so on. We have developed the sideslip angle estimation method for compensat- ing the driving condition changes which disturb the sideslip estima- tion. The vehicle sideslip angle estimation using a combination of vehicle model observer and pseudo integral is proposed. The vehicle model observer includes tire non-linear characteristics for fitting actual tire characteristics. Moreover, road- tire friction, road bank 18</page><page sequence="18">2001-01-0137-2001-01-0143 and vehicle spinout judgments are developed for increasing the esti- mation accuracy. The developed sideslip estimation method is eval- uated through full-scale vehicle tests. It was verified that this side- slip estimation experimentally confirms the system performance and robustness. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0138.

This paper discusses the development of combination vehicle stability program (CVSP) at Visteon. It will describe why stability control is needed for combination vehicles and how the vehicle sta- bility can be improved. We propose and evaluate controller structures and design meth- ods for CVSP. These include driver's intent identification, combina- tion vehicle status estimation and control, and fault detection/ tolerance. In this paper, the braking and steering dynamics of car- trailer and tractor-semitrailer combinations, and the brake systems which should be used extensively to increase the stability of combi- nation vehicles are presented. Also our development platform is introduced and the combination vehicle simulation results are pres- ented. The definition of combination vehicles in this paper includes car-trailer and commercial tractor-semitrailer combinations since their vehicle dynamics are based on the same equations of motion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0139.

Demonstrate the accuracy of two vehicle simulations by comparing their predicted responses to experimentally observed vehicle responses and metrics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-0140. Parameter determination and vehicle dynam- ics modeling for the NADS of the 1998 Chevrolet Malibu. Mohamed Kamel Salaani, Transportation Research Center Inc.; Gary J. Hey dinger, S.E.A., Inc.; and Paul A. Gry gier, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The paper discusses the development of a model for a 1998 Chevrolet Malibu for the National Advanced Driving Simulator's (NADS) vehicle dynamics simulation, NADSdyna. The Malibu is the third vehicle modeled for the NADS, and this is the third paper dealing with model development. SAE Paper 970564 contains details of the model for the 1994 Ford Taurus and SAE Paper 1999- 01-0121 contains details of the model for the 1997 Jeep Cherokee. The front and rear suspensions are independent strut and link type suspensions modeled using recursive rigid body dynamics for- mulations. The suspension springs and shock absorbers are modeled as elements in the rigid body formulation. To complement the vehi- cle dynamics for the NADS application, subsystem models that include tire forces, braking, powertrain, aerodynamics, and steering are added to the rigid body dynamics model. The models provide state-of-the-art high fidelity vehicle handling dynamics for real-time simulation. The methodology for generating the 1998 Chevrolet Malibu data is presented, as is all of the data for the chassis and sub- system models. This paper also adds some of the developments achieved lately to solve "zero speed" wheel spin dynamics, aerodynamics disturb- ing forces, and steering torque feedback. These issues need to be resolved and implemented for the proper operation of a high fidelity simulator like the NADS. 2001-01-0141. Model validation of the 1998 Chevrolet Malibu for the National Advanced Driving Simulator. Mohamed Kamel Salaani, Transportation Research Center Inc.; Paul A. Gry gier, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and Gary J. Heyd- inger, S.E.A., Inc. This paper presents an evaluation of a complete vehicle dynam- ics model for a 1998 Chevrolet Malibu to be used for the National Advanced Driving Simulator. Vehicle handling, braking and powertrain dynamics are evaluated and simulation results are com- pared with experimental field-testing. NADSdyna, the National Advanced Driving Simulator vehicle dynamics software, is used. The Malibu evaluation covers vehicle directional dynamics that include steady-state, transient frequency response, and vehicle lon- gitudinal dynamics composed of acceleration and braking. Also, analyses of the effects of modified tire parameters on vehi- cle dynamics response is performed. The effects of wind gusts gen- erated by a tractor-trailer and a bus on the Malibu vehicle directional dynamics are analyzed. For the steering system feel, we compare the handwheel torque feedback with the measured data during both high-speed dynamics and in the very low speed tire stick-slip regime. 2001-01-0142. (SP- 1608) An experimental investigation on the spray characteristics of dimethyl ether(DME). Xu Sidu, Yao Mingfa, and Xu Junfeng, Tianjin Univ. A series of tests were conducted using scattered laser light pho- tography to study the spray characteristics of DME and diesel fuel. The photographs show that, compared with diesel fuel, DME spray displays a slower penetration, much faster evaporation, and a wider spray angle by a factor of about 2, although its general appearance is similar to that of diesel spray. Another series of tests were per- formed with shadow photography, in which the detailed DME spray characteristics were investigated. The results of high-speed photog- raphy show that the spray breakup time of DME is 0.2~0.4ms, which is shorter than that of diesel fuel. Increasing the ambient den- sity resulted in a shorter breakup time, a wider spray angle, and rapid reduction in the spray penetration and spray tip velocity. With decreasing the orifice diameter, both the spray penetration and the spray angle decrease. The results show that the needle valve opening pressure almost has no effect on the DME spray penetration. Decreasing the needle valve opening pressure leads to a decrease in the spray angle at the beginning of the spray development, but it almost has no effect at the end of spray development. Testing was also run in engine-like ambient temperature ranging from 573K~773K, in which no big change in the spray penetration was found with increasing either the ambient temperature or the ambient density. The James model was used to investigate the mixing characteris- tics of DME spray. The calculation results agreed well with the experimental results, and showed that the DME spray has a higher air fuel equivalence ratio than diesel spray, indicating a better mix- ing with air in DME spray. This is one reason that DME emits low pollutant emissions. Also, the calculation results showed that increasing the ambient density or decreasing the orifice diameter would cause an increase in the air fuel equivalence ratio of DME spray. 2001-01-0143.

The lean-burn gas engine ignited by pilot oil is a promising alter- native combustion system. First, pilot flame is auto-ignited, then ignition source propagate toward lean gas mixture. Despite much research work conducted experimentally, little phenomenological understanding has been made on ignition characteristics of this com- 19</page><page sequence="19">2001-01-0143-2001-01-0149 bustion system. This makes improvement of engine performance a difficult task. The main objective of the present study is to reveal the combustion phenomena and ignition characteristics by visualiz- ing the combustion chamber while the engine is operated under the dual-combustion mode and the pure diesel mode at the same amount of light diesel-oil. An open-chamber-type single-cylinder research engine is employed, together with an endoscope suitable for observing a small space. Endoscope was inserted into the combustion chamber to allow continuous observation of the very fast combustion phenome- non that was photographed using a high-speed video camera. From the experimental results, ignition of pilot fuel was found to occur near the nozzle tip and, the location of the pilot flame was fixed at the nozzle tip by a later stage of combustion duration. And this pilot flame, possessing a 60-70J higher energy level than SI ignition energy, contributes to improve combustion stability in an ultra-lean mixture with a lambda of approximately 2.0. Furthermore, it is proved that ignition delay of the dual condition become longer than that of diesel condition at the same injection timing. A partial pressure of oxygen lowers due to including flammable gas in pre- mixture compared with diesel condition. So this makes the reaction pilot diesel oil with oxygen inhibit under the dual condition. So it further delays ignition timing in the dual mode than that occurring in the diesel mode. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0144. (SP- 1608) The development of gas (CNG, LPG and H2) engines for buses and trucks and their emission and cycle variability characteristics. Stanislav Beroun , Techn. Univ. Liberec ; and Jorge Martins , Univ. Minho. Few diesel vehicles engines from Czech production have been converted into gas (LPG, CNG)-fuelled SI engines. The higher power engines (peMAX &gt; 1 MPa) used the concept X »1 in turbochar- ging-intercooler and with oxidation catalysts mode with total (max) efficiency of about 38%. For lower power engines (peMAX &lt; 1 MPa) the more suitable concept was using X=1 in naturally aspirated (atmospheric) mode with 3-way catalysts. Most of the work included the development of the engines to work on Natural Gas (CNG) and LPG for buses and medium trucks. Some laboratory tests were done also with Hydrogen and Natural Gas on the labora- tory single-cylinder engine. The measurements consists of standard emissions (CO, HC, NOx, CO2, PM) but Polycycle Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH and their carcinogenic derivatives PAHcarc) were also investigated. Com- bustion stability was assessed by means of Coefficient of MIP (indi- cated mean effective pressure) Variation (VARpj) for lean and very lean gas-fuelled engines. The effect of Rate of Heat Release on VARpj was also investigated. Finally, the development of the combustion chamber design for a bus gas engine during a period of 7 years is shown and discussed, showing the improvements in various areas such as total efficiency, power and emissions. 2001-01-0145. (SP- 1608) The studies of an electronically con- trolled CNG system for dual fuel engines. Youtong Zhang , Xinghua Liu, Qing Yang, Xiukun Han, and Changgi Cheng, Beijing Institute of Technology. In order to improve the engine's emission performance and con- vert diesel engine to dual fuel engine, an electronically controlled natural gas injection system is developed for the X6130 naturally aspirated bus diesel engine. The system includes gas supply, elec- tronic control unit(ECU) and auxiliary systems, which consists of harness, sensors, mechanical diesel control system and diagnostic system. The injection natural gas pressure is 1 MPa and six high- speed solenoid valves(HSV) are used to control natural gas injection timing and quantity of each cylinder at each work cycle. The ECU is based on the MC68HC81 1 Al microcontroller unit(MCU) and the system software is edited by MOTOROLA assembly language. The test results show that the system has great advantage in the aspects of emission and economy. Adopting multi-point electronic control injection for dual fuel system can get as high as 92% of CNG substi- tution at rated power and reduce NOx and PM emissions greatly. Then we conduct the environment test for ECU and make road- running test on bus. The test results show that the dual fuel system is a practical system and that using dual fuel system to convert diesel engine is an important way to exert the advantage of natural gas in improving the emission of a bus engine. 2001-01-0148. (SP- 1608) Effects of advanced fuels on the par- ticulate and NOx emissions from an optimized light-duty CIDI engine. Patrick G. Szymkowicz, Donald T. French, and Chris C. Crellin, General Motors Corporation R&amp;D and Planning. A compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) engine was used to evaluate the engine-out emissions from four advanced CIDI fuels that define a broad range of properties. The fuels include a market- averaged California fuel (designated CARB) to serve as a bench- mark, a petroleum-based low sulfur, low aromatic hydrocracked fuel (LSHC), the LSHC fuel blended with 15% dimethoxy methane (DMM15), and a neat Fischer-Tropsch fuel (FT100). Engine-out particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and performance data were collected at 5 steady- state operating con- ditions. The engine calibration was optimized for each fuel and operating condition. Fuel injection timing was optimized for best fuel economy and the injection pressure was optimized for mini- mum smoke. The PM-NOx trade-off for EGR dilution was estab- lished for each fuel and operating condition with the optimum injec- tion timing and pressure. Modal-averaged mass emission results were computed for each fuel using a weighted combination of the data from each of the 5 operating conditions. Weighted results simplified the relative emis- sion comparisons and improved the confidence in the statistical analysis. Dunnett statistical techniques, for multiple-comparisons to a benchmark, were applied to the weighted results. Compared to the CARB fuel, the engine-out Total PM increased by 10% for LSHC, decreased by 24% for DMM15 and decreased by 31% for FT 100 for the engine operating at conventional EGR rates. When operating the engine at the maximum EGR rates, the engine-out Total PM increased by 25% for LSHC; decreased by 16% for DMM15 and decreased by 15% for FT 100. Engine-out NOx was slightly lower for the advanced fuels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0149. (SP- 1608) Evaluation of some alternative die- sel fuels for low emissions and improved fuel economy. Timothy P. Gardner, Scott S. Low, and Thomas E. Kenney, Ford Motor Co. This paper reports on Ford's participation in the PNGV 'Ad Hoc' Diesel Fuel Test program - Phase I. The purpose of this program was to assess the potential benefits of various fuel properties aimed at reducing engine-out emissions of NOx and particulates to meet LEV2 and Tier 2 emission standards. Four alternative fuels were evaluated using a Ford 1.2L DIATA diesel engine: 1) California Certification fuel (CARB), 2) low sulfur hydro-cracked fuel (LSHC), 3) LSHC fuel with a 15% Dimethoxy Methane blend (DMM), and 4) neat Fischer-Tropsch (FT100) fuel. Design of Experiments (DOE) and conventional techniques were used to evaluate the fuels at five speed and load conditions. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), injection rail pressure, and beginning of injection (BOI) timing were controlled during the tests. Steady-state engine performance, emissions, and cylinder pressure (combustion) data were recorded for each fuel. The results show that fuel properties can significantly affect die- sel combustion and exhaust emissions by altering the ignition delay and the relative proportion of premixed and diffusion burning. The results also show the importance of proper engine/fuel calibration in order to take advantage of the fuel property benefits. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 20</page><page sequence="20">2001-01-0150-2001-01-0154 2001-01-0150. (SP- 1608) An advanced diesel fuels test pro- gram. Salo J. Korn, DaimlerChrysler Corp. This paper reports on DaimlerChrysler' s participation in the Ad Hoc Diesel Fuels Test Program. This program was initiated by the U.S. Department of Energy and included major U.S. auto makers, major U.S. oil companies, and the Department of Energy. The pur- pose of this program was to identify diesel fuels and fuel properties that could facilitate the successful use of compression ignition engines in passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the United States at Tier 2 and LEV II tailpipe emissions standards. This portion of the program focused on minimizing engine-out particulates and NOx by using selected fuels, (not a matrix of fuel properties,) in steady-state dynamometer tests on a modern, direct injection, com- mon-rail diesel engine. Four fuels were chosen for this program: a specially blended fuel that reflected the typical diesel fuel available in California was used as a reference, a low sulfur hydrocracked fuel, a blend of 15% dimethoxy methane and 85% low sulfur hydrocracked fuel and a neat Fischer-Tropsch fuel. These three advanced fuels had low sul- fur and low aromatics. Tests were performed on a prototype Chrysler 1.9L, 4- valve, direct-injected, turbocharged and after-cooled common-rail diesel engine at four steady-state speed - load points chosen to represent the urban driving cycle: 1500 RPM - 42 Nm, 2000 RPM - 32 Nm, 2300 RPM - 67 Nm, and 2500 RPM - 140 Nm. Injection timing and rail pressure were optimized for minimum fuel consumption and smoke. In addition, a second series of tests were performed with injection timing retarded to produce a 2% fuel consumption penalty. As EGR was varied, the trade-off between total particulates and NOx emissions was obtained and the trade-off between solid partic- ulates and NOx emissions was estimated. At high EGR rates, only the F-T fuel showed a significant reduction in total particulates. However, both the 15% DMM fuel and the F-T fuel showed signifi- cant reduction in estimated solid particulates. Furthermore, there were indications that both the 15% DMM fuel and the F-T fuel may offer a significant smoke reduction at heavy-load, off-cycle conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0151.

Korn , DaimlerChrysler ; and Patrick G. Szymkowicz, General Motors Corporation R&amp;D and Planning. The future of diesel-engine-powered passenger cars and light- duty vehicles in the United States depends on their ability to meet Federal Tier 2 and California LEV2 tailpipe emission standards. The experimental purpose of this work was to examine the potential role of fuels; specifically, to determine the sensitivity of engine-out NOx and particulate matter (PM) to gross changes in fuel formulation. The fuels studied were a market-average California baseline fuel and three advanced low sulfur fuels (&lt;2 ppm). The advanced fuels were a low-sulfur-highly-hydrocracked diesel (LSHC), a neat (100%) Fischer-Tropsch (FT 100) and 15% DMM (dimethoxy meth- ane) blended into LSHC (DMM 15). The fuels were tested on mod- ern, turbocharged, common-rail, direct-injection diesel engines at DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors. The engines were tested at five speed/load conditions with injec- tion timing set to minimize fuel consumption. Data from each fuel and test engine were statistically analyzed at each speed/load condi- tion. The results were weighted and combined to provide an esti- mate of cycle average engine-out emissions at two EGR levels: 0% EGR and moderate EGR (which corresponds to the inflection region of the PM-NOx tradeoff curve). The projected reductions in engine- out NOx and PM were used to assess the remaining technical task for compliance with LEV2 and Tier 2 Bin 5 and Bin 8, considering a 70 mpg lightweight vehicle and a 30 mpg light-duty vehicle. There was a high degree of data variability among the fuels and engines in terms of their effect on PM and NOx emissions. The results indicate that, even under the most optimistic circumstances, fuel reformulation alone is not sufficient to reach Tier 2 or LEV2 tailpipe standards. Relative to the base fuel, these advanced fuels did not change the level of EGR that could be used before PM emissions significantly increased. Consequently, an overall systems approach (considering engine design, aftertreatment system, controls, calibra- tion strategy and fuel properties together) and technical break- throughs will be needed to address the challenges posed by future tailpipe standards. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0152. (SP- 1608) Reduction of NOx and PM from die- sel engines by WPD emulsified fuel. Phong Hai Vu, Osami Nishida, Hirotsugu Fujita, and Wataru Harano, Kobe University of Mercantile Marine; Norihiko Toyoshima, Nippo Sangyo K.K; and Masami Iteya, WOS-21 CO., Ltd. Blending pyrolitic oil (or Waste Plastic Disposal) produced from household and industrial plastic wastes with Marine Heavy Fuel Oil (C.Oil) reduces the viscosity of the heavy oil significantly. The experimental results indicated that, the WPD mixing ratio of 20 vol.% reduces the experimental heavy fuel oil viscosity 90% from 177 cSt to 20 cSt at 50°C. The blended oil has been applied to a small size high-speed single-acting 4-stroke diesel engine (16 horse- power, 2,200 rpm) without preheating the oil. However, NOx emis- sion slightly increases so that the WPD emulsified fuel oil has been tested with the aid of capsule-typed additives. The experimental WPD emulsified fuel oil (WPD Emulsified F.O) of 10 and 20 vol.% water and 0.3 vol.% additives indicates stability and helps reduce NOx emission by 30 and 50%. In order to compare with the NOx and particulate matter emis- sion when WPD is not used, emulsified fuels, in which only water and heavy fuel oil were blended at 10:90 and 20:80 volume ratios, were made with the aid of the same additive and applied to the engine. The experimental results have also shown a stable perfor- mance of the engine and a NOx reduction by 32% and 50% at the mixing ratios of 10:90 and 20:80 respectively. 2001-01-0153. (SP- 1608) Experimental investigations on a Jatropha oil methanol dual fuel engine. M. Senthil Kumar, A. Ramesh, and B. Nagalingam, Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Use of vegetable oils in diesel engines results in increased smoke and reduced brake thermal efficiency. Dual fuel engines can use a wide range of fuels and yet operate with low smoke emissions and high thermal efficiency. In this work, a single-cylinder diesel engine was converted to use vegetable oil (Jatropha oil) as the pilot fuel and methanol as the inducted primary fuel. Tests were conducted at 1500 rev/min and full load. Different quantities of methanol and Jatropha oil were used. Results of experiments with diesel as the pilot fuel and methanol as the primary fuel were used for comparison. Brake thermal efficiency increased in the dual fuel mode when both Jatropha oil and diesel were used as pilot fuels. The maximum brake thermal efficiency was 30.6% with Jatropha oil and 32.8% with diesel. Smoke was drastically reduced from 4.4 BSU with pure Jatropha oil operation to 1.6 BSU in the dual fuel mode. Hydrocar- bon and carbon monoxide emissions were higher in the dual fuel mode with both fuels. Heat release pattern in the case of neat Jatropha oil operation showed a smaller premixed combustion phase and a larger diffusion combustion phase as compared to diesel oper- ation. These phases were not distinguishable in the dual fuel mode. 2001-01-0154. (SP- 1608) Thermochemical characteristics of dimethyl ether - An alternative fuel for compression-ignition engines. Ho Teng, James C. McCandless, and Jeffrey B. Schneyer, AVL Powertrain Technologies, Inc. 21</page><page sequence="21">2001-01-0154-2001-01-0163 This paper analyzed chemical and thermophysical properties of dimethyl ether (DME) as an alternative fuel for compression- ignition engines. On the basis of the chemical structure of DME and the molecular thermodynamics of fluids, equations have been devel- oped for most of the DME thermophysical properties that would influence the fuel-system performance. These equations are easy to use and accurate in the pressure and temperature ranges for CI engine applications. The paper also pointed out that the DME spray in the engine cylinder would differ significantly from that of diesel fuel due to the thermodynamic characteristics of DME. The DME spray pattern will affect the mixing and combustion processes in the engine cylinder, which, in turn, will influence emissions from combustion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0155. (SP-1615) The effects of belt use and driver characteristics on injury risk in frontal airbag crashes. Donald F. Huelke, N/A. From the crash investigation files at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), the crashes involving deployed airbags were reviewed. The total number of deployments is 898 of which 764 are frontal crashes with the principal direction of force (PDF) at 11-1 o'clock. Of the drivers in these frontal crashes 83% were using the belt restraint. Overall, seven of ten drivers have an AIS-0 or 1 level injury as the maximum or highest injury severity level (MAIS). Of the survi- vors, one in six had a moderate level injury (AIS-2) as their most significant injury and one in nine had an MAIS 3 or greater injury. Fatalities are rare. There is a difference between injury severity frequencies of belted versus non-belted drivers. Three-quarters of the belted drivers had minor injuries compared to only half of those not belted. A dif- ference was also noted at the AIS-2 level-belted versus unbelted 14% versus 23%. Of the belted drivers 10% had an AIS 3-5 injury level compared to 20% of the unbelted. Drivers with AIS 3, 4 or 5 as their highest AIS level, whether belted or not, have the lower extremity as the body region most often injured. Belted drivers have a slightly higher frequency of upper extremity injuries. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0156. (SP-1615) Analysis of driver fatalities in fron- tal crashes of airbag-equipped vehicles in 1990-98 NASS/CDS. David S. Zuby and Susan A. Ferguson , Insurance Institute for High- way Safety; and Michael X. Cammisa, Association of International Automobile Manufacturers , Inc. This study, which is an extension of an earlier study, examined an additional 64 frontal crashes of airbag-equipped vehicles in the 1997-98 National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/ CDS) in which the driver died. The principal cause of death in each case was determined based on an examination of the publicly available case materials, which primarily consisted of the crash narrative, the injury/source summary, and photographs of the crashed vehicle. Results were consistent with the earlier anal- yses of the 1990-96 NASS/CDS files. In the combined data set (1990-98), gross deformation of the occupant compartment was the leading cause (42 percent) of driver deaths in these 116 frontal crashes. The force of the deploying airbag (16 percent) and ejection from the vehicle (13 percent) also accounted for significant portions of the driver deaths in these frontal crashes. There continues to be little or no evidence that airbags deploy with too little energy. In contrast to previous analyses, there were 5 crashes in 1997-98 in which the driver's fatal injuries may have resulted from bottoming the airbag. However, there were equally plausible, alternative expla- nations for these fatal injuries, including the possibility that they were caused by the airbag itself in 4 of the 5 cases. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0157. (SP-1615) Advanced air bag systems and occu- pant protection: Recent modifications to FMVSS 208. John E. Hinger and Harold E. Clyde , Exponent® Failure Analysis Asso- ciates , Inc. Because of a rising number of air-bag-related injuries and spe- cific Congressional instructions, FMVSS 208 was revised in March 1997. At that time, the changes allowed manufacturers to quickly implement redesigned air bags that were less powerful with the goal of reducing air-bag-related injuries. The legislature has since man- dated additional revisions to FMVSS 208 to ensure use of new tech- nologies for the protection of occupants of varying stature. This paper presents an overview of some of the more significant modifi- cations to FMVSS 208 and discusses some of the challenges for advanced air bag systems. 2001-01-0158. (SP-1615) Design targets of seat integrated restraint system for optimal occupant protection. Rongrong Zhou , Wei Hong , and Venkat Lakshminarayan , Ford Motor Co. Unlike the conventional seat belt system wherein the shoulder belt upper anchor is mounted on the vehicle body, Seat Integrated Restraint (SIR) system has the shoulder belt upper anchor mounted on the top of seat back frame. During a vehicle frontal impact, the stiffness of seat and that of the floor underneath the seat play a sig- nificant role in the performance of the restraint system in providing protection to the occupants. In this study the effect of the stiffness of seat and floor on the restraint system is investigated with other restraint parameters such as retractor load limit, fire time lag of dual stage inflator and air bag vent size. The stiffness of seat and floor is varied to determine the range of best occupant protection. This study attempts to establish feasible design targets of seat and floor stiffness for optimal restraint performance. 2001-01-0159. (SP-1615) Robust automated airbag module calibration. Peter J. Schubert , Delphi Delco Electronics Systems. Increasing sophistication of electronic safety systems requires more advanced tools for design and optimization. Systems of safety products already being designed are becoming too interdependent to calibrate as stand-alone modules. Compounding this difficulty is the trend towards fewer test crashes and more sophisticated regula- tory requirements. This paper presents a unified calibration approach to produce robust performance. First, the set of crash sam- ples are extended using statistical techniques. Then an automated calibration tool using Genetic Algorithms is used to provide robust performance against deployment requirements. Finally, an expert systems is employed to ensure logical behavior. Together, these powerful methods yield calibrations which out-perform manual cali- brations and can be completed in far less time. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0163. (SP-1615) A preliminary look at occupant sensing and child restraints. Wendy Pewinski, Kevin Ventura , and John Sadek , Magna Seating Systems. Manufacturer-supplied child restraint systems were positioned on a current production automotive seat. Data were collected to determine current footprint pressure data plots. Based on these data, two easily identifiable footprint configurations were developed in the investigation of reproducible sensor mat classifications based on a common footprint. Testing for visual comparison and procedural confidence was carried out using both the normal and modified con- figurations. The completed prototypes were subsequently tested in a seat out- fitted with an occupant classification sensor for learning and system verification capability. Data were collected in four scenarios; a 0, 15, 30, and 45 degree skew across the seat cushion centerline for all three footprint configurations. Each scenario was incrementally loaded at 9.1, 13.6, and 18.2 kg (20, 30, and 40 lbs.). This preliminary investigation showed that although more testing and collaboration needs to take place, the mat type sensing system has the potential to characterize the base, or footprint, of a child 22</page><page sequence="22">2001-01-0163-2001-01-0169 restraint system.

(SP-1615) Influence of air bag folding pattern on OOP-injury potential. Yiqin Mao and Hermann Appel, Institute of Automotive Technology. Four different air bag folding patterns are discussed in this paper. The influence of air bag folding pattern on inflation characteristics and occupant OOP-injuries is simulated and evaluated. The results indicate that different folding patterns strongly influence their aggressiveness. Compared with the other foldings, the leporello- folding, corresponding to the high opening pressure and high "punch out"-, "bag slap"-, "membrane loading"-effect is proved to be a critical folding pattern for the OOP-Injuries. This study also shows that the combination of design, test and simulation provides a comprehensive and effective tool to investi- gate the influence of air bag design parameters on the OOP-injury and to develop the "Advanced Air Bags." 2001-01-0165. Theoretical evaluation of the requirements of the 1999 advanced airbag SNPRM - Part one: Design space constraint analysis. Tony R. Laituri, N. Sriram, Brian P. Kach- nowski, Brion R. Scheidel, and Priya Prasad, Ford Motor Co. In the 1999 Supplemental Notice for Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) for Advanced Airbags, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sought comments on the maximum speed at which the high-speed, unbelted occupant test suite will be conducted, i.e., 48 kph versus 40 kph. To help address this question, an analysis of constraints was performed via extensive mathematical modeling of a theoretical restraint system. First, math models (corre- lated with several existing physical tests) were used to predict the occupant responses associated with 336 different theoretical dual- stage driver airbag designs subjected to six specific Regulated and non-Regulated tests. Second, the pertinent, predicted occupant responses for all 336 designs were compared with a set of generic acceptance criteria for the six distinct performance constraints (where two of the six represented the aforementioned "high-speed" unbelted occupant test suite and where "high-speed" was set equal to either 48 or 40 kph). Finally, statistics were generated to help evaluate the stringency of the various performance constraints. Results from the assessment for a modeled, prototype, mid-sized passenger car included the following: (1) None of the 336 theoreti- cal dual-stage driver airbag designs satisfied the generic acceptance criteria set when the unbelted rigid fixed barrier testing constraints were run at 48 kph, (2) 21 of the 336 satisfied the generic acceptance criteria set when the unbelted rigid fixed barrier testing constraints were run at 40 kph, and (3) When considering the discarded designs, nearly all of them were predicted to not comply due to (at least one of) the unbelted occupant performance constraints of the generic acceptance criteria set. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0167. (SP- 161 6) US and UK field rollover character- istics. Chantal Parenteau, Delphi Automotive Systems; and Pete Thomas and James Lenard, Loughborough Univ. In this study, US and UK accident data were analyzed to identify parameters that may influence rollover propensity to analyze driver injury rate. The US data was obtained from the weighted National Automotive Sampling System (N ASS-CDS), calendar years 1992 to 1996. The UK pre-roll data was obtained from the national STATS 19 database for 1996, while the injury information was collected from the Co-operative Crash Injury Study (CCIS) database. In the US and UK databases, rollovers accounted for about 10% of all crashes with known crash directions. In the US and UK data- bases, most rollovers occurred when the vehicle was either going straight ahead or turning. The propensity for a rollover was more than 3 times higher when going around a bend than a non-rollover. In the UK, 74% of rollovers occurred on clear days with no high winds and 14% on rainy days with no high winds. In the US, 83% of rollovers took place in non-adverse weather conditions and 10% with rain. In the US and the UK, more than 50% of rollovers hap- pened during daylight. However, compared with non-rollover inci- dents, US and UK rollovers had a higher propensity to occur with sleet/fog or snow and in the dark without streetlights. In the UK, 76% of rollovers took place on roads with a speed limit of 50 mph (80 kph) and above, while in the US, the rate was 51%. In the US, drivers were most often distracted by people inside and outside their vehicle or when eating and/or drinking, and falling asleep. The results indicate that pre-rollover characteristics are some- what similar in the US and in the UK. Rollovers were more likely to occur with sleet/fog or snow and in the dark than non-rollover crashes. Vehicles that were traveling straight on a highway or going around a curve were most likely to roll. In this study, the overall injury distribution was similar in US and UK drivers. For belted and unbelted drivers, serious injuries were most frequent in the head and in the thorax, emphasizing the need to provide protection in both these areas. The pre-rollover and injury information obtained in this study may thus be useful for the devel- opment of global preventive measures. 2001-01-0168. (SP- 1616) Rear-end impact testing with human test subjects. Thomas A. Braun, Janet H. Jhoun, Michael J. Braun, Brad M. Wong, Thomas A. Boster, Ted M. Kobayashi, Frank A. Perez , and Gary M. Hesler, Boster, Kobayashi &amp; Asso- ciates. Low speed rear-end aligned bumper-to-bumper impact tests were conducted. Bullet vehicle impact speeds ranged from 3.2 - 10.5 kph (2.0 - 6.5 mph) and produced target vehicle changes in velocity ranging from 2.4 - 7.2 kph (1.5 - 4.5 mph). Seven human volunteers participated in the testing. The volunteer group included both male and female subjects ranging in age from 29 to 61 years. All partici- pants were considered to be in good health prior to the start of the testing. Two test subjects were seated in the target vehicle and one subject drove the bullet vehicle for each of the seven tests. Occupant kinematic response was monitored via videotape and test subjects were interviewed immediately post-impact to record subjective impressions. The majority of the participants experienced no symp- toms or injury as a result of this testing. Three of the participants that had multiple exposures had minor neck stiffness, but not pain, that resolved without treatment in one day. The vehicle restitution response was analyzed. The results indicate a coefficient of restitu- tion in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 for the range of impact speeds and vehicles tested. The duration of impact was found to be in the range 0.090 - 0.124 seconds. 2001-01-0169. (SP- 1577) Effect of Hybrid III leg geometry on upper tibia bending moments. David S. Zuby, Joseph M. Nolan, and Christopher P. Sherwood, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The knee and ankle joint pivots of the Hybrid III dummy's leg are positioned in approximately the same orientation as the knee and ankle joint rotation centers of a human in a normal driving posture. However, the dummy's leg assembly is not simply a straight mem- ber between these two pivots. It is a zigzag-shaped solid link com- posed of one long straight section in the middle and short angled sections at either end, which form the pivots. The upper and lower tibia load cells are mounted on the straight middle section, making the upper tibia load cell location anterior to the line between the ankle and knee pivots and the lower tibia load cell location slightly posterior to the line between the pivots. Hence, an approximately vertical force on the foot can act along the line behind the upper tibia load cell and in front of the lower tibia load cell, creating bending moments. The upper tibia moment would bow the leg forward (neg- ative Y moment by SAE J211 convention), and the lower tibia moment generated would bow the leg rearward (positive Y moment). Such spurious bending moments, particularly at the upper 23</page><page sequence="23">2001-01-0169-2001-01-0173 tibia, can be large enough to suggest a significant risk of proximal tibia fracture that likely would not exist in humans subjected to the same forces. Several instances of forward bending of the proximal tibia coincident with axial loading on the lower tibia have been iden- tified among the data recorded in 64 km/h (40 mi/h) frontal offset crash tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The ratio of upper tibia bending moment to measured tibia axial force was approximately equal to the distance between the center of the upper tibia load cell and the line connecting the knee and ankle pivots. In addition, other measures recorded on the same leg indicated the proximal tibia bending was due predominantly to an upward force on the foot. This paper describes how the potentially erroneous indications of proximal tibia fracture risk were identified and suggests a method for estimating more realistic moments at the upper and lower load cell locations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0170. (SP- 1577) Interaction of the hand and wrist with a door handgrip during static side air bag deployment: Simulation study using the CYS/ATB multi-body program. Brian M. Boggess, Edwin M. Sieveka, Jeff R. C randall, and Walter D. Pilkey, University of Virginia Automobile Safety Laboratory ; and Stefan M. Duma, Virginia Tech Impact Biomechanics Laboratory . This paper presents a parametric study that utilized the CVS/ ATB multi-body simulation program to investigate the interaction of the hand and wrist with a door handgrip during side air bag load- ing. The goal was to quantify the relative severity of various hand and handgrip positions as a guide in the selection of a test matrix for laboratory testing. The air bag was represented as a multi-body system of ellipsoidal surfaces that were created to simulate a proto- type seat-mounted thorax side air bag. All simulations were set in a similar static test environment as used in corresponding dummy and cadaver side air bag testing. The occupant mass and geometric properties were based on a 5th percentile female occupant in order to represent a high-risk segment of the adult population. The upper extremity model consisted of wrist and forearm rotations that were based on human volunteer data. In particular, ellipsoids were added to model the thumb that was needed to simulate the hand engaged in the handgrip. Parameters that were varied included the handgrip length, angle, and spacing, the initial position and orientation of the distal forearm and hand, the inclusion of pronation and supination in the forearm, and the relative motion of the shoulder joint com- plex. The simulations showed that the inclusion of a handgrip does increase the compressive forearm loading when compared to the matched position, no handgrip simulation. The results also showed sensitivity to initial hand position and wrist orientation with respect to the handgrip. Increasing the length of the handgrip resulted in an increasing trend of peak forearm compressive forces. With regards to the handgrip angle relative to the plane of the armrest, the peak forearm compressive loads were similar in the range of 10° to 45° from the horizontal; however, the forearm compressive loads were lower for the extreme cases of 0° and 90°. Simulations that allowed forearm pronation and clavicle translation resulted in lower wrist loads than those with dummy-like joint properties. Further, the lower loads calculated for the allowed pronation simulation suggests that in order to not over predict loads from ATD testing, pronation may need to be incorporated. 2001-01-0171.

Eubanks, Automobile Collision Cause Analysis; and Eero Pasanen, Helsinki City Planning Department. Pedestrian collisions are primarily a disease of urban streets and intersections, where both pedestrian and automobile traffic are in high volume. City engineers and planners are plagued with the prob- lem of mitigating the number of pedestrian/vehicle collisions while maintaining traffic flow. In an attempt to study the problem in depth, city engineers in Helsinki, Finland placed a camera in a bus station clock tower overlooking a busy downtown intersection in February of 1991. The camera was placed at the intersection to study pedes- trian and vehicle behavior at the intersection and to quantify the speeds of the respective parties. Since its installation, the camera has witnessed fifteen pedestrian/vehicle accidents. Detailed measurements of the intersection were taken for analy- sis of the accidents. The intersection was also calibrated with the camera in place for use of the digitizing system. The videotape foot- age was analyzed using digitizing motion analysis software to quan- tify the pre-impact and post-impact trajectories of both the vehicle and the pedestrian for each accident. The data were then compared with existing crash test information regarding the trajectory of cadavers and dummies. A comparison to many of the existing pedestrian throw equations was also performed as part of this study. 2001-01-0172. (SP- 1577) Modalities for constructing 3D mod- els of head and neck anthropometry, spinal cord and vertebral structures of infants to adolescents - For application to crash test dummy design. Nadine R. Levick, Melyappan Solalyappan, Jennifer Gentry, Christopher Kabrhel, and Jurek G. Grabowski, John Hopkins Univ. Current anthropometric data of pediatric head and neck are based on discrete linear measurements and limited primarily to 2D projec- tions. Also available anthropometry identifies limited surface dimensions without regard for the neck segment as a dynamic struc- ture. There has been recent focus on adult anthropometry for the development of the WorldSID, similarly representative data from pediatric populations is very limited. These 2D linear data have lim- ited correlation to the morphologic dimensions of the internal struc- tures of the spinal cord and vertebral column and do not include con- sideration of the changes in the head and neck morphology or dimensions which occur during movement from extension through neutral position to flexion. There are a number of modalities in use in the healthcare and related industries which could be applied to the determination of these anthropometric parameters and structural relationships. This paper describes three potential modalities to enable such information to be collected, and their relative benefits and limitations. The modalities include simple 2D linear measure- ment, 3D infrared digitized surface scanning and 3D Magnetic Res- onance imaging. The age groups of the subjects included ranged from infants to adolescents (4 weeks to 14 years). The three modali- ties demonstrated that a detailed digital 3D reconstruction of the pediatric head and neck morphology can be performed based on child human volunteer subjects, and that Magnetic Resonance Imag- ing 3D reconstruction was effective in relating the surface anthropo- metric form to the morphologic dimensions of the spinal cord and vertebral structures. These modalities can be applied to the develop- ment and design of crash test dummies and related computer models. 2001-01-0173.

A gap in protection appears to exist for older children who have outgrown booster seats and are placed in some adult, 3-point belts with fixed shoulder belt anchorage points. Boys on average do not reach the 50th percentile adult, male seated height until age 15 and 1/2 and the average girl never reaches this height. The published minimum seated height and weight thresholds for use of three-point belts alone are inconsistent with the official recommendations by The National Transportation Safety Board and the majority of state seat belt laws. A shoulder belt with a fixed upper anchorage, which is typical in the rear occupant space, may create torso belt routing that can allow rollout from the shoulder belt in frontal oblique colli- sions. A belt trajectory that passes across the neck of an older child may create an artificial fulcrum in the cervical spine resulting in quadriplegia. Excessive webbing lengths can promote child occu- pant excursion, rebound and injurious head contact. The differences 24</page><page sequence="24">2001-01-0173-2001-01-0177 in older child protection reported in U.S. versus Australian car crashes suggest that safety improvements may be achieved with more rigorous state legislation and improved torso belt restraints, which appropriately accommodate both children and adults (i.e., "size-appropriate restraints") in all positions occupied by child pas- sengers. Further studies are indicated to fully elucidate the scope of the problem in U.S. crashes and the effectiveness of recommended design and public policy interventions. 2001-01-0174. (SP- 1577) High speed measurement of contact pressure and area during knee-to-instrument panel impact events suffered from frontal crashes. Jesse V. Benny , Himamshu B. Marigowda, and Patrick J. Atkinson , Kettering Univ.; and Ed Clancy , Randal Gosk , Tom Jett , and Mike Jendrowski, BREED Technologies. Numerous human cadaver impact studies have shown that acute injury to the knee, femoral shaft, and hip may be significantly reduced by increasing the contact area over the anterior surface of the knee. Such impact events are common in frontal crashes when the knee strikes the instrument panel (IP). The cadaveric studies show that the injury threshold of the knee-thigh-hip complex increases as the contact area over the knee is likewise increased. Unfortunately, no prior methodology exists to record the spatial and temporal contact pressure distributions in dummy (or cadaver) experiments. Previous efforts have been limited to the use of pres- sure sensitive film, which only yields a cumulative record of con- tact. These studies assumed that the cumulative pressure sensitive film image correlated with the peak load, although this has never been validated. A temporal record of the varying contact pressures would thus be helpful in validating models studying high-speed con- tact events (i.e., knee impact) incurred during automotive crashes. Thus, the aim of the current study was to present a new methodology to study the contact mechanics of the knee-IP impact event. This was achieved by using specially designed electronic pressure mats capable of transducing the corresponding contact area and pressure magnitudes at a sampling frequency of 1,340 Hz. Sled tests were performed at different delta- V' s using a Hybrid III, 5th percentile female dummy. The instrument panels were simulated with blocks of different padding materials of varying stiffness. This produced a variety of contact pressures, areas, and femur loads. The impact load values as recorded by the load cell in the femoral shaft of the dummy, were correlated with the corresponding contact area and contact pressure values to investigate if the peak load at the knee also corresponds with the cumulative pressure distribution. The cur- rent study showed that the center of pressure migrated approxi- mately 13 mm suggesting that the temporal pressure distribution is a better measurement than a cumulative image if the true contact area is needed. 2001-01-0175. (SP- 16 16) Responses of human surrogates to simulated rear impact: Velocity and level dependent facet joint kinematics. Brian D. Stemper , Narayan Yoganandan, and Frank A. Pintar , Medical College of Wisconsin and VA Medical Center. The objective of the present study was to determine the kinemat- ics of the human head-neck complex with specific reference to pos- terior facet joints as a function of rear impact acceleration. Six intact human head-neck complexes were prepared by fixing the first tho- racic vertebra in polymethylmethacrylate. The specimens were ori- ented such that the Frankfurt plane was horizontal and the cervico- thoracic disc was at an angle of 25 degrees to simulate the normal driving position. Retroreflective targets were inserted to the cervical vertebrae. The specimens were subjected to simulated rear impact accelerations using a minisled apparatus. A series of tests were con- ducted with velocities of 2.1, 4.6, 6.6, 9.3, and 12.4 km/h. In this study, to achieve the objective, results are presented on the facet joint motions at the C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7 levels as a function of change in velocity. Data were extracted from high-resolution high- speed video photography such that the compressive and sliding motions of the facet joints at the three levels were quantified and compared using statistical techniques. Results indicated that the cer- vical facet joints demonstrate compression of the most dorsal regions accompanied by distractions of the most ventral regions. Data demonstrated monotonically increasing variations of peak compression and peak sliding kinematics with increasing changes in velocity. However, C5-6 facet joints responded with higher mag- nitudes of compression at higher changes in velocity than their adja- cent counterparts, but lower magnitudes at lower changes in veloc- ity. These data may be of value in the determination of local changes in spinal component kinematics secondary to varying changes in rear impact acceleration. 2001-01-0176. (SP-1616) Near- and far-side adult front pas- senger kinematics in a vehicle rollover. Chantal Parenteau and Madana Gopal, Delphi Automotive Systems; and David Viano , Saab Automobile , AB. In this study, U.S. accident data was analyzed to determine inte- rior contacts and injuries for front-seated occupants in rollovers. The injury distribution for belted and unbelted, non-ejected drivers and right front passengers (RFP) was assessed for single-event accidents where the leading side of the vehicle rollover was either on the driver or passenger door. Drivers in a roll-left and RFP in roll-right rollovers were defined as near- side occupants, while drivers in roll- right and RFP in roll-left rollovers were defined as far-side occu- pants. Serious injuries (AIS 3+) were most common to the head and thorax for both the near- and far-side occupants. However, serious spinal injuries were more frequent for the far-side occupants, where the source was most often coded as roof, windshield and interior. Based on the injury sources for both situations, head injuries seem to occur from contact with the roof, windshield (in particular for unbelted occupants) and pillars, while thoracic injuries resulted from contact with steering assembly and the interior. The field injury data was compared with the Hybrid III responses obtained from simulated mathematical rollovers to better understand occupant kinematics and injury biomechanics. These simulations were validated using laboratory tests. The laboratory tests included the FMVSS 208 dolly rollover, the ADAC corkscrew, curb and soil- trips, bounce-overs and fall-overs. Based on the mathematical simulations, the kinematics of the front far-side occupant differed from that of the near-side. For the belted far- side occupant, the torso often slipped out of the belt which allows excursion towards the near-side occupant. For the belted near-side occupant, the shoulder belt remained on the upper body during the initial roll phase. The occupant nonetheless moved up and outwards and the head could contact the roof-rail and header areas depending on the rollover condition simulated. The near-side occupant's head crossed the window plane more frequently than the head of the far-side occupant. Dummy kinematics from the simula- tion help explain the frequency of serious head and thorax injuries reported in the field. Field data analysis and mathematical simula- tions are useful in understanding injury biomechanics and providing guidance for future testing. 2001-01-0177. (SP-1616) Investigation of restraint function on male and female occupants in rollover events. Carley C. Ward , Hrire Der Avanessian, Parris Ward , and Jacqueline G. Paver , Biodynamics Engineering , Inc. Factors influencing neck loading in rollover events were identi- fied in a series of spit tests where vehicles were inverted. Drivers included both male and female human volunteers, as well as seated standard and standing pedestrian 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummies. The passenger sides of the vehicles were rotated down first, simulating the most dangerous rotation for the driver, a far-side roll. The variables investigated during the spit tests included body shape, pre-roll body position and vertical seat velocity. Conditions causing shoulder belt webbing to pass through to the lap belt were investigated together with the corresponding body kinematics. Early in the far-side rolls, the belt tended to slip off the shoulder and the 25</page><page sequence="25">2001-01-0177-2001-01-0185 slack was immediately passed through to the lap belt, increasing body excursion toward the roof. An alert position (i.e., sitting more upright prior to the roll) increased the body excursion in the roll and, correspondingly, the risk of neck injury. Chest geometry and com- pressibility caused some women to experience excessive motion toward the roof, increasing their risk of neck injury. Neither dummy adequately simulated the excursions experienced by the volunteers. Latch plates that restricted webbing pass-through to the lap belt reduced the body excursion and thus, provided better neck protec- tion. Computer simulations using the MADYMO occupant simula- tor program were also performed to study the dynamic interaction of the head, torso, and roof during contact with the ground, a study which was not possible using volunteers. 2001-01-0178. (SP- 1616) Developing a passenger movement simulation method to reduce whiplash injuries. Shigeki Maehara and N oboru Shimamoto, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.; and Noriyuki Hayamizu, Toyota Central R&amp;D Lab., Inc. In recent years minor injuries from auto collisions continue to be a problem in terms of QOL (Quality Of Life). One of them is a whip- lash injury which is caused by rear impacts. The Daihatsu Motor Company succeeded in developing a new seat structure for reducing whiplash injuries. In this paper, we describe a rear impact simulation model used to develop new seat structures. We first constructed an actual rear impact simulation model using a normal seat. Seat characteristics were measured by compo- nent tests. We next calculated a computer simulation model using the seat incorporating an anti-whiplash mechanism. We found the computer simulation model had the same effect as the experiment in reducing injury. Finally, in parameter studies, the OOP (Out Of Position) cases were found to correspond well with the experiment and could be applied to various purposes. 2001-01-0179. (SP-1577) Air bag loading on in-position Hybrid III dummy neck. Jian Kang, Venkatesh Agaram, Guy Nusholtz, and Gregory Kostyniuk, DaimlerChrysler Corp. The Hybrid III family of dummies is used to estimate the response of an occupant during a crash. One recent area of interest is the response of the neck during air bag loading. The biomechani- cal response of the Hybrid III dummy's neck was based on inertial loading during crash events, when the dummy is restrained by a seat belt and/or seat back. Contact loading resulting from an air bag was not considered when the Hybrid III dummy was designed. This paper considers the effect of air bag loading on the 5th percentile female Hybrid III dummies. The response of the neck is presented in comparison to currently accepted biomechanical corridors. The Hybrid III dummy neck was designed with primary empha- sis on appropriate flexion and extension responses using the corri- dors proposed by Mertz and Patrick. They formulated the mechani- cal performance requirements of the neck as the relationship between the moment at the occipital condyles and the rotation of the head relative to the torso. The deformation of the neck was due to the motion of the head relative to torso, when the torso was restrained either by the seat belt or the seat back. Air bag loading is significantly different from belt or seatback loading, because there is more than one load path on the head. During air bag loading, the dummy neck shows significantly different responses from those seen in the Mertz and Patrick tests. The neck experiences second mode bending during air bag loading as opposed to the first mode bending seen in seat belt and/or seat back loading. The Hybrid III 5th percentile female dummy is frequently used to estimate the response of small stature occupants to air bags. This paper examines the Hybrid III 5th percentile female dummy's neck responses due to air bag loading. The neck responses were found to be highly dependent on how the air bag interacts with the dummy. Three modes of air bag-neck interaction were observed and studied: air bag directly loading the head, air bag trapped under the chin dur- ing the deployment process and air bag trapped behind the jaw of the dummy head. This paper also presents the results of some exper- imental modifications to the head/neck design of the Hybrid III 5th percentile female dummy to prevent air bag entrapment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0180. (SP-1577) Knee and hip displacements of vehi- cle occupants restrained by seat belts in frontal impacts. Michael Araszewski, Amrit Toor, and Andrew Happer, INTECH Engineering Ltd. This study presents an efficient method for forensic engineers to determine the expected forward knee and hip displacements of auto- mobile occupants who are restrained by seat belts during frontal impacts. The amount of knee displacement sustained by an occupant in a vehicular collision must be determined in order to assess seat belt usage and benefit. The results of this study may be referenced to model the lower body motion of vehicle occupants in frontal impacts for a range of impact severities. Previous research has empirically determined hip and limited knee displacements for sub- jects restrained in frontal impacts of specific severities; however, these research results have not been directly compared to produce a simple and practical model that is applicable for a range of colli- sion severities. 2001-01-0183. (SP- 1581) Global trends in diesel emissions regulation - A 2001 update. Michael P. Walsh, Consultant. Across the entire globe there has been tremendous movement toward the further control of diesel vehicle emissions over the past 1 to 2 years. With regard to heavy-duty vehicles, the EU in late 1999 finalized requirements for Euro 3, Euro 4 and Euro 5, to be phased in by 2008. These requirements are expected to require the introduc- tion of advanced PM and NOx controls. The US EPA has adopted even more stringent requirements to be introduced in 2007 along with very low sulfur (&lt;15 PPM) diesel fuel. Japan is in the process of an intense review which will likely reduce fuel sulfur levels to at least 50 PPM and introduce substantially tighter PM requirements by 2005. They are also developing a major diesel retrofit program. With regard to light duty vehicles, the California Air Resources Board has established the principle that diesel fueled vehicles should meet the same standards as gasoline fueled vehicles and the US EPA followed suit with its Tier 2 program. These and other efforts will be described in the paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0184. (SP- 1581) Diesel emission control in review. Timothy V.

Nonthermal plasma discharges in combination with catalysts are being developed for diesel aftertreatment. NOx conversion has been shown over several different catalyst materials. Particulate removal has also been demonstrated. The gas phase chemistry of the plasma discharge is described. The plasma is oxidative. NO is converted to NO2, CH3ONO2 and HNO3. Hydrocarbons are partially oxidized resulting in aldehydes and CO along with various organic species. Soot will oxidize if it 26</page><page sequence="26">2001-01-0185-2001-01-0191 is held in the plasma. When HC is present, SO2 is not converted to sulfates. Suitable plasma-catalysts can achieve NOx conversion over 70%, with a wider effective temperature range than non-plasma cat- alysts. NOx conversion requires HC and O2. Electrical power con- sumption and required exhaust HC levels increase fuel consumption by several percent. A plasma catalyst system has demonstrated over 90% particulate removal in vehicle exhaust. The plasma catalyst system is the subject of active research and knowledge is growing rapidly. Significant questions remain about the mechanisms of plasma catalysis both for NOx and particulates. The development is very early and rapid progress is being made. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0186. (SP- 1581) Impact of future exhaust gas emis- sion legislation on the heavy-duty truck engine. Franz X. Moser , Theodor Sams , and Wolfgang Cartelliera AVL List GmbH . Emission standards as proposed in Europe and the United States for heavy-duty diesel engines will require a NOx and particulate reduction of more than 90%. This cannot be achieved by internal engine measures alone. Aftertreatment systems, for either one or both emission components, plus sophisticated electronic control strategies will be required. Various strategies to comply with EU 4, 5 and US 2007 are discussed, also showing their impact on engine performance. For typical 1 and 2 liter per cylinder engines, emission reduction concepts are assessed to identify the most suitable tech- nology for major worldwide markets. The assessment is based on thermodynamic studies, test-bed results and estimates on cost and infrastructure implications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0187. (SP- 1581) Particulate trap selection for retro- fitting vehicle fleets based on representative exhaust tempera- ture profiles. A. Mayer, TTM; P. Nöthiger, LogLink; R. Zbinden, INFRAS ; and R. Evéquoz , Buwal. A methodology for correctly matching trap systems to the vehi- cle types was developed within the scope of a feasibility study to retrofit the entire Swiss fleet of on-road HDV. Representative test vehicles from 11 vehicle categories were equipped with high- capacity data loggers during a period of 4-6 weeks. Statistical evalu- ation of exhaust temperatures indicate that data on averages, peaks and frequency distributions alone can be misleading, because these tend to over-estimate the available exhaust enthalpy. Analysis of dwell time intervals, at certain temperature levels, is a better method to assess the energy available for the regeneration. Such verification of duty cycles is indispensable before retrofitting traps and choosing either active or passive regeneration systems. 2001-01-0188. Diesel vehicles emissions control and its emis- sions benefits in Hong Kong. Wing-tat Hung and Chun-shun Cheung, Hong Kong Polytechnic Univ.; and Danny Y au, Allan Hung, Matthew Tsang, Kong Ha, and W. C. Mok, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Diesel vehicles emission is the main contributor to the air pollu- tion in Hong Kong accounting for almost all the particulate and 75% of nitrogen oxides emissions from vehicles. The control strategy of the Hong Kong Environment Protection Department is: Introducing the most stringent practicable emissions and fuel standard; Introduc- ing clean alternatives to reduce the reliance on diesel vehicles; Strengthening the inspection on the emissions of motor vehicles; Stepping up the enforcement against smoky vehicles; Retrofitting of in-use vehicles with locally practicable technology; Promoting environmentally friendly driving behavior and awareness of proper vehicle maintenance. This paper summarizes the progress of all the control measures and also reports in detail the results and the way forward of the vari- ous trials of diesel vehicles retrofit technologies including small par- ticulate traps, oxidation catalysts and ultra-low sulfur diesel. The objectives of these trials were to determine the feasibility, effective- ness and acceptability of these technologies by the concerned vehi- cle operators. Over 100 private and government vehicles from the transport trade and franchised bus companies were involved in these trials and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University was responsible for the emission testing. With the implementation of the vehicle emission control mea- sures, ore target is to reduce the particulate and nitrogen oxides emissions from vehicles by about 80% and 30% respectively by 2005. 2001-01-0189. (SP- 1582) New approaches to catalyst sub- strate application for diesel engines. M e ike Reizig , Rolf Brück, Roman Konieczny, and Peter Treiber, Emitec GmbH. Nearly all real diesel engine operation is leading to low exhaust temperatures. Standard catalyst technique remains therefore for sig- nificant time below light off. To improve the conversion behavior two approaches were made: placement of tailor-fitted catalysts as close as possible to the engine exhaust port before turbocharger and usage of closed coupled catalysts with the so-called hybrid design. Both measures are providing visible progress in reducing diesel engine emissions. Tests were made with modern diesel engines both for passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles. 2001-01-0190. Thermal durability of wall-flow ceramic diesel particulate filters. G. A. Merkel, W. A. Cutler, and C. J. Warren, Corning, Inc. The maximum use temperature of a diesel particulate filter is often thought to be limited only by the melting point of the filter material itself. This paper suggests that the maximum practical use temperature for filters is limited not by the intrinsic filter melting temperature, but by the temperature at which the metal oxide ash collected from the engine exhaust sinters and adheres to the filter wall, or the temperature at which the filter undergoes eutectic melt- ing by reaction with the ash. Ash sintering and adherence without reaction with the filter material may result in loss of filter permeabil- ity and a permanent pressure drop increase. Chemical reactions between the ash and the filter can result either in pinholes through the walls, which compromise filtration efficiency, or glazing on the surface of the walls, which increases back pressure. These metal oxide deposits that comprise the ash are derived from engine wear, oil additives, fuel additives, and corrosion of the manifold and other exhaust system components. Excessive temperatures can be avoided by employing sophisti- cated regeneration controls and/or by employing filters that have a high volumetric heat capacity and/or a high thermal conductivity. Several new monolithic DPFs are under development that exhibit a unique combination of high thermal shock resistance and high vol- umetric heat capacity. Temperatures generated within these filters during uncontrolled regenerations are substantially lower than those observed for other ceramic oxide filters, resulting in little or no reac- tion between the filter and ash under severe operating conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0191. (SP- 1582) Effect of SiC-DPF with high cell density for pressure loss and regeneration. Noriyuki Taoka, Kazushige Ohno, Sungtae Hong, Hiroki Sato, Yutaka Yoshida, and Terno Komori, Ibiden Co., Ltd. One technology for removing PM discharged from diesel- powered vehicles is the DPF system. The DPF system brings about increases in pressure loss because PM accumulates in the filter. DPF with a high cell density shows low pressure loss when PM accumu- lates because of the large filtration area, and in addition, it makes it possible to thin the cell wall because it has a high thermal diffu- sion ability. For the catalyzation of SiC, the pore size and porosity of the base material were changed. Even when a catalyst is born, pressure loss which DPF changed pore structure hardly changes. 27</page><page sequence="27">2001-01-0191-2001-01-0198 This verification was done based on the theory and by means of experimentation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0192. (SP-1582) Diesel particulate filters made of newly developed SiC. S. Miwa, F. Abe , T. Hamanaka , T. Yamada, and Y. Miyairi, NGK Insulators , Ltd . This paper presents the performance and durability test results of a newly developed diesel particulate filter (DPF) made of silicon carbide (SiC). While SiC offers thermal resistance that is superior to cordierite, it requires a complex, multi-segment bonded design structure due to the thermal expansion coefficient that is higher than cordierite, which leads to a higher thermal stress during regenera- tion. This company has developed a honeycomb slit-type DPF made from a newly developed SiC through the application of its own hon- eycomb forming technology and material technology, and has also succeeded in controlling the cost of the product through a simplified design. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0193. (SP-1582) Effects of microstructure and cell geometry on performance of cordierite diesel particulate filters. G. A. Merkel , D . M. Beali, D. L. Hickman, and M. J. Vernacotola, Corning Incorporated. Cordierite has been the cost-effective material of choice for die- sel particulate filters (DPFs) for heavy-duty vehicles due to its com- bination of excellent thermal shock resistance, filtration efficiency, and durability under most operating conditions. However, it has been observed that under some conditions of uncontrolled regenera- tion at moderately high soot loading, localized regions of melting in cordierite DPF bodies can occur. A new cordierite monolithic diesel particulate filter has been developed for medium- and heavy-duty trucks for OEM and retrofit applications. Through modification in pore microstructure and filter cell geometry, this new DPF provides improved survivability during uncontrolled regenerations, reduced pressure drop, and improved thermal shock resistance and strength. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0194.

Wang Xiancheng and Gao Xiyan, Dalian University of Technology ; Rong Hua, Dlian University of Technology; and Wang Shuyi, Armored Force Engineering Institute. A new kind of diesel particulate after-treatment system (EDPF) has been developed. It uses stainless steel nets as the particulate trapping part and uses reverse blowing unit combining with centrifu- gal collector as the regeneration part. In order to improve the filter- ing efficiency of stainless steel nets, corona-discharging technology is applied to charge particles before the stainless steel nets. The test result on the 6110 Diesel bench scale shows that the filtering effi- ciency of the EDPF system can reach to about 70% and the EDPF system is successful. 2001-01-0195. (SP- 1592) Effects of multiple injections and flexible control of boost and EGR on emissions and fuel con- sumption of a heavy-duty diesel engine. D. T. Montgomery and R. D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin. A study of the combined use of split injections, EGR, and flexi- ble boosting was conducted. Statistical optimization of the engine operating parameters was accomplished using a new response sur- face method. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the emissions and fuel consumption capabilities of a state-of-the-art heavy-duty diesel engine when using split injections, EGR, and flex- ible boosting over a wide range of engine operating conditions. Pre- vious studies have indicated that multiple injections with EGR can provide substantial simultaneous reductions in emissions of particu- late and NOx from heavy-duty diesel engines, but careful optimiza- tion of the operating parameters is necessary in order to receive the full benefit of these combustion control techniques. Similarly, boost has been shown to be an important parameter to optimize. During the experiments, an instrumented single-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine was used. A prototype mechanically actuated (cam driven) fuel injection system was used to provide multiple injections. Flexi- ble control of boost and EGR was accomplished by controlling the pressure of the intake and exhaust surge tanks. The operating condi- tions studied include operation close to the peak torque condition and at high speed at a medium and at a low load condition. The vari- ables considered in the optimization process included injection pres- sure, boost pressure, EGR rate, injection timing, and split injection parameters. Using the new response surface optimization scheme, the engine could be optimized rapidly, yielding both reductions in emissions consistent with future heavy-duty standards, and also a substantial reduction in fuel consumption compared to the same engine using an electronic unit injector calibrated for 1998 emis- sions levels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0197. (SP- 1592) Emissions trade-off and combustion characteristics of a high-speed direct injection diesel engine. Naeim A. Henein, Ming-Chia Lai, Inderpal Singh, Dahai Wang, and Liang Liu, Wayne State Univ. The emissions trade-off and combustion characteristics of a high- speed, small-bore, direct-injection, single-cylinder, diesel engine are investigated at three different load conditions. The experiments cov- ered a wide range of parameters including the injection pressure, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and swirl ratio (Sw). The effects of each parameter on the ignition delay (ID), apparent rate of energy release (ARER), NOx, Bosch smoke unit (BSU), CO and hydrocarbons are investigated. The results show that the NOx emis- sion dropped continuously with the increase in EGR (up to 55%), but with increasing smoke emission in a classical trade-off relation- ship. The increase in injection pressure generally reduced smoke with NOx penalty; however, the NOx penalty decreased at higher EGR. There also appears to be an increase in the cool flame intensity at the high EGR rates. Applying swirl at high EGR rate and high injection pressure conditions further reduced smoke emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0198. (SP- 1592) The effect of EGR on the perfor- mance and pollutant emissions of heavy-duty diesel engines using constant and variable AFR. D. A. Kouremenos and D. T. Hountalas, National Technical University of Athens; and K. B. Binder, DiamlerChryslerAG. Pollutant emissions and specifically NO and soot are one of the most important problems that engineers have to face when develop- ing heavy-duty DI diesel engines. Two main strategies exist as options for their control, reduction inside the engine cylinder using advanced combustion and fuel injection technologies and use of after-treatment systems. In the present work it is examined the use of EGR to control the formation of NO inside the cylinder of an engine with extremely high peak pressure. The work is applied on a single-cylinder truck test engine developed under a project funded by the European Community focusing on the improvement of heavy-duty DI diesel engine efficiency using increased injection timing. Use is made of a simulation model to predict the effect of more advanced injection timing on engine performance and emis- sions. The model has been modified to include the effect of EGR used to control the formation of NO which is considerably increased at high injection timings. Experimental results from the engine with- out EGR at various engine operating conditions and injection tim- ings have been used to determine the baseline for evaluating the effect of EGR on engine performance and emissions and to validate the model used. Various engine conditions are examined covering the operating range of the engine. Using the simulation model results are produced concerning engine performance, i.e., cylinder pressure, heat release, BSFC and tailpipe values for NO and soot. For each engine operating condition various percentages of EGR are examined and their impact on engine BSFC and pollutant emissions is determined. As observed the use of EGR results to a slight increase of BSFC, a reduction of NO and an increase of soot emis- 28</page><page sequence="28">2001-01-0198-2001-01-0202 sions. Due to the last it was decided to examine using the simulation code the possibility for increasing boost pressure to maintain the overall AFR the same as in the case without EGR. The findings of the investigation are interesting since it is revealed that using an increased boost pressure soot is not increased seriously with EGR, BSFC is maintained fairly the same while the reduction of NO is slightly lower but in any case very significant compared to operation without EGR. Results are also provided concerning the distribution of thermodynamic parameters and pollutants inside the fuel jet revealing the actual effect of EGR on their formation. Especially important is the information obtained when comparing values under EGR operation at constant AFR with the ones obtained with a cons- tant boost pressure since a better explanation for the observed results is provided helping us understand the actual effect of EGR on the pollutant formation mechanism. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0199. (SP- 1592) Using advanced injection timing and EGR to improve DI diesel engine efficiency at acceptable NO and soot levels. D. A . Kouremenos and D. T. Hountalas , National Technical University of Athens; and K. B. Binder , A. Raab, and M. H. Schnabel , Daimler-Chrysler AG. The direct-injection diesel engine is one of the most efficient thermal engines known to man. For this reason DI diesel engines are widely used for heavy-duty applications and especially for the pro- pulsion of trucks. Even though the efficiency of these engines is cur- rently at a high level there still exist possibilities for further improvement. One way to accomplish this is by increasing the injec- tion timing which usually improves, depending on the operating conditions, the indicated efficiency of the engine. On the other hand advanced injection timing has a negative effect on peak pressure causing a serious increase of its value, a negative effect on NO emis- sions which are also seriously increased and a positive effect on Soot emissions which are reduced. In the present work, a theoretical and experimental investigation is presented to determine the effect of more advanced injection timing on engine performance and pol- lutant emissions. The theoretical work is conducted using a multi- zone combustion model describing in detail the combustion mecha- nism and formation of pollutants inside the engine cylinder. The experimental investigation is conducted on a heavy-duty single- cylinder truck test engine developed under a European Project. As revealed from the modeling and the experimental findings injection advance has a positive effect on engine efficiency which is greater at higher engine operating speeds and loads. On the other hand, a serious increase of NO emissions is observed leading to values that are higher than the limits set by European legislation. For this reason it is examined the use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to control NO emissions. From the analysis of theoretical and experimental findings it is revealed the required percentage of EGR at various engine operating conditions to maintain NO at acceptable levels. The use of EGR causes a sharp reduction of NO and an increase of soot emissions, which is partially compensated by its reduction due to the more advanced injection timing. On the other hand, EGR results to a slight reduction of engine efficiency and maximum com- bustion pressure which in any case does not alter the benefits obtained from the high injection timing. As observed it is possible to increase brake efficiency considerably for the specific engine using a combination of more advanced injection timing and EGR while maintaining pollutants at acceptable levels. In this case, the maximum combustion pressure rises to values around 220-230 bar, while a further increase does not result to significant improvement of efficiency. An important issue is that the findings of the theoreti- cal investigation agree with the ones of the experimental one reveal- ing the importance of modeling for similar applications since it can provide assistance during engine development, speeding up the entire process and also a better understanding of the experimental findings. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0200. (SP- 1592) Ultra-clean combustion technology combining a low-temperature and premixed combustion con- cept for meeting future emission standards. Shuji Kimura, Osamu Aoki, Yasuhisa Kitahara , and Eiji Aiyoshizawa , Nissan Motor CO., Ltd. Experimental investigations were conducted with a direct- injection diesel engine to improve exhaust emission, especially nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), without increas- ing fuel consumption. As a result of this work, a new combustion concept, called Modulated Kinetics (MK) combustion, has been developed that reduces NOx and smoke simultaneously through low-temperature combustion and premixed combustion, respec- tively. The characteristics of a new combustion concept were inves- tigated using a single-cylinder DI diesel engine and combustion photographs. The low compression ratio, EGR cooling and high injection pressure was applied with a multi-cylinder test engine to accomplish premixed combustion at high load region. Combustion chamber specifications have been optimized to avoid the increase of cold-start HC emissions due to a low compression ratio. The results indicate the possibility of obtaining ultra-clean internal com- bustion engines capable of meeting Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) regulations in the 21st century. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0201. (SP- 1592) Single-stage dilution tunnel perfor- mance. Qiang Wei, David B. Kittelson, and Winthrop F. Watts, Uni- versity of Minnesota. A one-stage dilution tunnel has been developed to sample and dilute diesel exhaust. The tunnel has the capability of simulating many aspects of the atmospheric dilution process. The dilution rate and overall dilution ratio, temperature, relative humidity, and resi- dence time in the tunnel, as well as residence time and temperature in the transfer line between the tunnel and exhaust sampling point may be varied. In this work we studied the influence of the exhaust transfer line, tunnel residence time, and dilution air temperature on the exhaust particle size distribution. The influences of fuel sulfur content on the size distribution and on the sensitivity of the size dis- tribution to dilution and sampling conditions were also examined. We do not suggest an optimum dilution scheme, but do identify crit- ical variables. The final choice of dilution schemes must be informed by comparisons between particle measurements made in the plumes of vehicles in the atmosphere and those made in the labo- ratory. Such work is currently underway in the CRC E-43 program and will be reported in future publications. A long residence time in the transfer line from the engine to tun- nel was shown to decrease formation of nuclei mode particles which were mainly in the 8 to 30 nm diameter range. The likely explana- tion is that particle precursors like sulfuric acid and hydrocarbons are adsorbed onto existing particles and the walls of the transfer line. Increasing residence time in the tunnel itself led to a modest increase in the number particles measured in the nuclei mode even at very high dilution ratios. Decreasing dilution air temperature markedly increased formation of nuclei mode particles. Neither tunnel resi- dence time nor temperature influenced the concentration of particles in the accumulation mode (roughly the 30 to 300 nm diameter range). Increasing the fuel sulfur content increased the formation of nuclei mode particles but did not significantly influence the accumu- lation mode. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0202.

Daisuke Kawano, Jiro Senda, Kazuya Kawakami, Atsushi Shimada, and Hajime Fujimoto, Doshisha Univ. In the present study, we have proposed a novel fuel design con- cept in order to achieve low emissions and combustion control in engine systems. The fuel design concept is based on the combustion control that could be realized by using a mixed fuel with a lower boiling point fuel, such as gasoline or gaseous fuel components and a higher boiling point fuel, such as gas oil or fuel oil components. 29</page><page sequence="29">2001-01-0202-2001-01-0210 According to the fuel design concept proposed in this work, the characteristics of vaporization during mixture formation process as well as of combustion can be reasonably improved due to the forma- tion of two-phase region. The heat release analysis was conducted to compare the temporal history of heat release for both a mixed fuel and a single component fuel that has the same transport properties of mixed fuels. In addition, the two-color method, which simulta- neously allows the measurements of temperature distribution and soot concentration, is applied to the combustion field for mixed fuels. The several experiments were conducted in Rapid Compres- sion &amp; Expansion Machine (RCEM). The experimental results related to fuel distribution and combustion process shows that the fuel design concept proposed in the present study can be applied to the combustion system for low emission and combustion control. 2001-01-0204. (SP- 1592) The transient storage and blow-out of diesel particulate in practical exhaust systems. G. E. Andrews , A. G. Clarke , and N. Y. Rojas , University of Leeds; and T. Sale , and D. Gregory , Ford Motor Company Ltd. Previous work on the transient storage of particulate in diesel exhaust systems (SAE 2000-01-0508) was carried out mainly at conditions where storage in the exhaust would dominate the process. The test involved a preconditioning of the engine the previous day with about 4 hours of engine idling. This ensured that the exhaust had a significant level of deposits. The following day low-power cold starts were investigated and the movement of particulate between the two silencer boxes was determined as well as the net blow out of deposited particulate. Continuing deposition if particu- late was also shown even in the presence of net blow out. The present work extends this previous work to higher power blow out conditions. Also investigated was the preconditioning of the engine at high power the previous day so that the exhaust was in a much cleaner condition. The previous tests were then repeated. This showed that deposition in the exhaust pipe was greater, but that blow out of particles still occurred at high-power conditions. It took typically 30 minutes before the deposition and release of particles in the exhaust stopped occurring. This coincided with the exhaust reaching an equilibrium temperature after the cold start. The work was carried out using four simultaneous constant tem- perature exhaust particulate sampling systems. 2001-01-0205. (SP- 1592) Experimental investigation on the use of water diesel emulsion with oxygen-enriched air in a DI diesel engine. K. A. Subramanian and A. Ramesh, Indian Institute of Technology Madras. A single-cylinder, direct injection diesel engine was run on water diesel emulsion at a constant speed of 1500 rpm under variable load conditions. Water-to-diesel ratio of 0.4 on the mass basis was used. Tests indicated a considerable reduction in smoke and NO levels. This was accompanied by an increase in brake thermal efficiency at high outputs. HC &amp; CO levels, ignition delay and rate of pressure rise went up. The heat release rate in the premixed burn period was higher. When the oxygen concentration in the intake air was enhanced in steps up to 25% along with the use of water diesel emul- sion, the brake thermal efficiency was improved and there was a fur- ther reduction in the smoke level. HC and CO levels also dropped. NO emission went up due to increased temperature and oxygen availability. An oxygen concentration of 24% by volume was opti- mal as the NO levels were near about base diesel values. With this percentage of oxygen and water diesel emulsion as fuel, the smoke level reduced from 5.3 BSU to 1.3 BSU at the maximum output tested. HC level was lower than diesel values and CO emission showed a similar trend at high outputs. 2001-01-0207. (SP- 1592) Single-stage dilution tunnel design. Qiang Wei , David B. Kittelson, and Winthrop F. Watts , University of Minnesota. A single-stage dilution system has been designed to simulate the process of engine exhaust dilution in the atmosphere. An exhaust sample stream is introduced into a partial flow tunnel where it is diluted at a controlled rate. Temperature, relative humidity, dilution ratio and rate, and residence time are all adjustable. The system includes a turbulence generator to adjust the intensity of turbulence in the tunnel and a wake disk to control the initial mixing rate. Numerical methods were used to simulate flow fields, velocity fields, and mixing profiles for gases and particles. Mixing profiles for a gaseous tracer and particles of different sizes were also deter- mined experimentally and compared with the model predictions. Critical parameters that influence mixing profiles and dilution rates predicted by modeling were demonstrated experimentally. Predicted and measured normalized mixing profiles were found to be in good agreement. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0208. (SP-1588) A dyno data acquisition system for lean NOx trap investigations. Joseph R. Asik, Robert J. Beier, and Quingjun Zhang , Ford Motor Co. A flexible, easily configuration data acquisition system was designed and built for detailed studies of the steady state and dynamic properties of lean NOx traps for an engine dynamometer environment. The system is based on the industry standard VXI backplane. The overriding design philosophy was to design and develop a data acquisition system that was user friendly and could be operated easily by engine laboratory technicians, as well as by test engineers. The primary requirements guiding the design were the following: (1) the ability easily to configure, save, recall, mod- ify, and print test configurations. (2) The ability to configure the gain, channel name, and engineering units for each analog channel. (3) The ability to trigger from one analog input channel. (4) A provi- sion for numeric auto-incrementing of data file names. (5) The abil- ity to save data in Excel™ compatible ASCII format. (6) The utiliza- tion of off the shelf VXI hardware. The primary user interface dis- play is written in Labview™. It includes the real time displays and the primary control display. The Test Manager™ software is written in C++, and provided the interface to manage tests and store test configurations. The Test Manager™ is modeled after Windows Explorer™ and has the capability to create, copy, save, and modify tests; set trigger conditions; and define other test parameters. The application of this novel data acquisition system to the study and characterization of lean NOx traps is briefly discussed. 2001-01-0209. (SP-1588) Error analysis of various sampling systems. Michael T. Sherman, Karyn Lennon, and Richard E. Chase, Ford Motor Co. Numerical models for a variety of vehicle emission measurement systems have been developed using Mathematica® software. The sampling systems evaluated include the Constant Volume Sampler (CVS) and the Bag Mini-Diluter (BMD). The CVS system was eval- uated as the conventional fixed flow rate system and in a number of configurations designed for improved performance. The enhanced CVS system employs flow rate switch between phases and heated dilution air. This system with various other enhancements was also evaluated. The additional enhancements included propor- tional ambient sampling, dilution air refinement, heating of system including bags, and heated system with dilution air refinement. Lastly, the Bag Mini-Diluter system was evaluated. The purpose of these models is to help determine which system will be the most effective strategy for Ford Motor Company to utilize for SULEV and below emission measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0210. (SP-1588) Application of a magnetic sector- type hydrogen analyzer for engine emission measurement. Shigeru Nakatani, Feibo Wang, Masaaki Ishihara, Masayuki Adachi, and Kozo Ishida, Horiba, Ltd. 30</page><page sequence="30">2001-01-0210-2001-01-0215 A new hydrogen analyzer using a magnetic sector mass spec- trometer (MS) has been developed to perform continuous analysis of hydrogen gas concentrations in exhaust gas. This method is insensitive to substances other than hydrogen gas ions and so is not easily affected by the presence of other molecules. In addition, this analyzer has a fast response compared to conventional hydrogen analyzers, which employ other measurement principles. The T90 response time is about 1 second. The minimum sensitivity is few tens of ppm. Because of these characteristics, the sector MS method has significant potential for analyzing hydrogen concentrations in exhaust gas continuously. In this study, the authors performed continuous emissions mea- surement of several kinds of gasoline engine vehicles in a chassis test cell using the hydrogen gas analyzer in combination with other gas analyzers. Transient measurement of hydrogen offers beneficial information that may be used to improve a combustion system and reduce harmful exhaust compounds. The results of the vehicle emis- sions testing, the technique of the measurements, and the capability of the application for an engine measurement system are also described in detail. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0211. (SP-1588) Simulation of low-level vehicle exhaust emissions for evaluation of sampling and analytical sys- tems. Michael Landry , Mark Guenther , Kimberly Isbrecht , and Gary Stevens , Ford Motor Co. The Vehicle Exhaust Simulator was developed to emulate emis- sions from low-emitting gasoline vehicles. Federal Test Procedure (FTP) 3-phase bag values (THC, CO, CO2, and NOx) from an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) have been used for most of the testing. The Simulator consists of five Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs), a ±15 volt power supply, a mixing chamber, stainless steel plumb- ing, a 2.83 m3/min centrifugal blower, and a laptop computer with Lab VIEW™ software and analog input/output capability. A custom Lab VIEW™ program sends independent 0-5 volt signals to each MFC to control the amount of each emissions constituent (bottled gases) to be injected. The software also records 0-5 volt output sig- nals from each MFC proportional to the MFC's metered flow. The emissions targets and known bottled gas concentrations (1% NIST traceable) are used to accurately simulate the exhaust of the vehicle with high repeatability. The gases are combined in a mixing tube, which closely resembles a vehicle tailpipe with a marmon flange. A moveable cart houses the equipment and is used on the emissions test site in place of a vehicle. The investigations discussed in this paper were designed to (1) quantify the repeatability and accuracy of the vehicle exhaust simu- lator "constant mass" injection mode, and (2) determine the feasibil- ity of using the Vehicle Exhaust Simulator as a means for aldehyde/ keytone sampling system prove out. This paper will also discuss MFC flow calibration standards, and recommended simulator enhancements and future investigations. 2001-01-0212. (SP-1588) Refinement of a bag mini-diluter system. Mark Guenther , Kristin Brown , Michael Landry, and Michael Sherman, Ford Motor Co.; and Dien-Yeh Wu, Floriba Instruments, Inc. As automakers begin to develop and certify vehicles that meet the California Air Resources Board LEV II and Environmental Pro- tection Agency Tier II Regulations, the study/usage of the Bag Mini-Diluter (BMD, or Mini-Diluter) sampling system continues to increase. Previous papers have provided an overview of the BMD and compared the measurements from the BMD to the measure- ments from a traditional constant volume sampler (CVS). These papers have suggested that the BMD approach offers new opportu- nities to improve the quality of vehicle exhaust measurement at very low levels, which will be crucial for accurate measurements on vehi- cles meeting LEV II SULEV standards (NMOG =10 mg/mile, NOx = 20 mg/mile). This paper continues the effort to study and implement the BMD sampling system as the optimal sampling system for SULEV mea- surements. Based on the results from previous testing, a number of investigations have been initiated to improve the quality and under- standing of BMD measurements. To improve understanding of the Mini-Diluter concept, the critical components are divided into "functionality modules." The "functionality modules" include; (1) control of the fixed dilution ratio using critical flow Venturis, (2) exhaust flow measurement using an Ultrasonic Meter, (3) bag fill and proportionality control using a mass flow controller, and (4) gas analysis and material selection for gas preservation. Each of the "functionality modules" are discussed in detail, including estimated errors due to the current state of performance, recent investigations to improve the understanding of the module, and recent improve- ments in each module's performance. Suggestions to improve the measurement accuracy of the BMD (these revisions are to be adopted during the redesign of the BMD for implementation into a new SULEV Test Cell) and to identify areas where technical improvements will be beneficial to BMD measurements are pres- ented. The paper concludes by presenting Mini-Diluter test data from a Prototype SULEV Test Cell. This Mini-Diluter data supports the position that the BMD is the most effective sampling system for accurate SULEV measurements, with potential for further improve- ments in the future. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0213. (SP-1588) Evaluation of a UV analyzer for NOx vehicle emission measurement. J. D. Baronick, B. Heller, and G. Lach, Volkswagen AG; F. Bogner, U. Gerspach, H. Schimpl, and D. Gruber, AVL List GmbH; and W. Fabinski, M. Moede, and M. Zöchbauer, ABB Analytical. Chemiluminescense detectors (CLD) represent well-established instruments to measure the concentrations of the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in raw as well as diluted automotive exhaust in accordance with the regulations in the United States of America and the Euro- pean Community. Although the CLD offers the benefits of wide measuring ranges down to low concentrations with a fast response time, its drawbacks are characterized by quenching effects caused by carbon dioxide and water, by an adverse cost-benefit ratio, by the fact that ozone, a highly toxic gas, is necessary for operation, and by additional components needed, such as vacuum pumps and deo- zonizer. As a consequence, car manufacturers and agencies are look- ing for alternative analyzers for the measurement of NO in raw exhaust gas. Ultraviolet (UV) analyzers have potential to replace the CLD, as they offer advantages like low noise, no water and CO2 interference, less equipment for operation and reduced costs. This paper presents investigations on a new UV-analyzer for analysis of NOx and its potential for the detection of other com- pounds. A detailed comparison of NOx measurements operating on an UV-spectroscopy based analyzer parallel to a standard CLD device is given. The experiments are performed under realistic conditions on an engine and chassis test cell at various applications. Long-run data on t90-times, drift, repeatability, etc are presented and dis- cussed. Moreover, both instruments have been tested at both, steady state and transient tests. A discussion of the respective data is pres- ented and the correlation is analyzed. Additionally the analyzer specifications are determined and compared against the CLD device. 2001-01-0215.

Burtscher, Uni- versity of Applied Science ; N. Bukowiecki , Paul Scherrer Institute; and A. Mayer , Technik Thermische Maschinen. Swiss EPA and European occupational health authorities have sponsored the development of a new sampling and measuring sys- tem designed to fulfill future requirements of differentiated particle analysis in field use and for certification purposes. The system sup- presses the formation of condensates by applying hot dilution. Solid carbonaceous particles are distinguished from ash particles by means of two different sensors. Particles are size classified by their mobility; their active surface is measured. The measurable size ranges from less than 10 nm to 1 micrometer. The detection limit corresponds to a mass concentration of elemental carbon (EC) of about 0.1 pg/m3. The time resolution of 1 second is suitable for on- line analysis of particulate emission during all types of transient cycles, even no-load acceleration. The system includes a compact diluter with tuneable dilution factor from 30 to 3000. The instrument is applicable for engine certification, field control and ambient mea- surement. Currently it is used for trap specification and field control in Switzerland and in Canadian mines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0217. (SP-1588) Issues for measuring diesel exhaust particulates using laser induced incandescence. S. Gupta , R. Poola , and R. Sekar, Ar gonne National Laboratory. A number of studies in the recent past have identified Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) as a versatile technique for measure- ment of soot concentration in flames. Recently, a number of researchers have focused their attention in adapting this technique to measure particulates in diesel exhausts. However, the agreement with established physical sampling techniques, such as the EPA rec- ommended filter paper collection method, was found to be less than ideal. This paper reports our efforts to adapt this technique for diesel exhaust characterization. Many of the factors affecting LII signal were identified through computer modeling. Parameters that could not be determined through such a model were determined experi- mentally following a parametric study. Subsequently, LII measure- ments were performed in the exhaust of a modified lab burner, with conditions close to that of diesel engine exhausts. Such measure- ments show excellent agreement with those performed through filter paper collection by a TEOM. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0218. (SP-1588) An alternative technique for low particulate measurement. Hirokazu Fukushima , Hiroshi Uchi- hara, Ichiro Asano , Masayuki Adachi, Shigeo Nakamura , Masahiko Ikeda, and Kozo Ishida, Horiba, Ltd. For the purposes of environmental protection, regulations of par- ticulate matter are becoming more stringent year by year. Accord- ingly, engine systems have been improved and particulate emissions are much lower compared to those of previous engine systems. The automotive industry generally uses a gravimetric method to quantify particulate emissions. It is becoming increasingly difficult to quantify particulate emissions using a conventional gravimetric balance because the amount of particulates continues to decline. In order to overcome this problem, a new method has been devel- oped that uses gas analyzers to measure potentially as much as sev- eral micrograms of particulates. Furthermore, with this method, it is possible to simultaneously analyze volatile organic fraction (VOF), soot, and sulfates. The particles collected by a quartz filler are placed in a furnace at a specific temperature, and VOF and sulfates are vaporized in an inert atmosphere. The organic fraction is oxidized and measured by a gas analyzer as CO2. Vaporized sulfate is converted to SO2 under high temperature and measured by a gas analyzer. These gas con- centrations are then used to determine the VOF and sulfate mass. Subsequently, O2 is fed into the furnace, the soot is oxidized, and the CO2 concentration is measured to determine soot mass. This paper investigates the performance of this new method of using a gas analyzer and discusses the experimental results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0219.

This paper describes a new sampling concept for particle emis- sion measurements. The purpose is to produce repeatable and repro- ducible conditions for nucleation phenomena. The exhaust is sam- pled and instantaneously diluted by inserting a porous tube diluter inside the tailpipe. This is carried out in order to prevent uncon- trolled sample transformations in sampling lines. The sampling sys- tem was tested in size distribution measurement of light duty diesel vehicle. The tests showed a clearly bimodal size distribution with distinguished nuclei and accumulation modes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0220. (SP-1588) A study of the dilution effects on particle size measurement from a heavy-duty diesel engine with EGR. Arvind Suresh and John H. Johnson , Michigan Technological Univ. A study of particle size distributions was conducted on a Cum- mins Mil 1995 engine using the Scanning Mobility Par-ticle Sizer (SMPS) instrument in the baseline and downstream of the Catalyzed Particulate Filter (CPF). Measurements were made in the dilution tunnel to investigate the effect of primary dilution ratio and mixture temperature on the nuclei and accumulation mode particle forma- tion. Experiments were conducted at two different engine modes namely Mode 1 1 (25% load - 31 1 Nm, 1800 rpm) and Mode 9 (75% load - 932 Nm, 1800 rpm). The nanoparticle formation decreased with increasing dilution ratios for a constant mixture temperature in the baseline as well as downstream of the CPF II for Mode 1 1 condi- tion. At Mode 9 condition in the baseline, the dilution ratio had a little effect on the nanoparticle formation, since the distribution was not bimodal and was dominated by accumulation mode particles. However, the effect of dilution ratio on nanoparticle formation could be clearly seen downstream of the CPF II at Mode 9 condition and the nanoparticle formation decreased with increasing dilution ratios. The dilution ratio had no significant effect on the accumula- tion mode particle formation at both the modes in the baseline and downstream of the CPF II. The mixture temperature had no signifi- cant effect on the nanoparticle and accumulation mode particle for- mation for a constant dilution ratio at two different modes in the baseline and downstream of the CPF II. It was concluded that for the MTU dilution tunnel, the nanoparticle formation decreases at higher dilution ratios (&gt;40:1) and in addition to making measure- ments at lower dilution ratios (&lt;15: 1), the future particle size mea- surements will also be made at higher dilution ratios where less nanoparticles are formed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0221.

This paper assesses the impact of the cold start phase of light duty vehicle use on energy use based on a review of large set of vehicle emissions test data from Canadian and U.S. Government databases. The data indicate that, at 24°C test ambient, a 20% increase in fuel use is measured in the "cold" Bag 1 driving com- pared with the "hot" Bag 3. Lower ambient conditions increase this penalty in a linear manner such that at the -6.7°C test condition, the penalty rises to 40-80%. The paper then integrates the laboratory tests data with vehicle demographic and usage data gathered from consumer driving studies. Included in this data are results from a small pilot survey in Vancouver, which directly measured instantaneous fuel consump- tion of vehicles in consumer use.

As regulations on exhaust gas become stricter, it is desirable that catalytic converters be mounted directly under the engine. Accord- ingly, in order to improve the reliability of the alumina mat specifi- cations under dynamic load conditions, the compatibility between the vibration conditions and the alumina mat specifications was examined. Through this examination, it was found out that the compatibility could be adjusted by vibration load applied per alumina mat, regard- less of the shape of the catalytic carrier. Further, it was found that the fatigue life of the alumina mat complies with that of the ceramic materials. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0225.

Lym- burner, John Li, George Wu, Haren Gandhi , Reggie Zhan, Weijian Han, Lifeng Xu, and Dennis Schuetzle, Ford Motor Co.; and Huang Ronghuang, and Deng Deguo, Kunming Institute of Precious Met- als. Low-cost automotive catalysts have been developed that contain 20-30% of the precious metals (7-15 g/ft3) commonly used in con- ventional catalysts, while providing a high efficiency of emissions control and durability for vehicles operating in emerging market countries. These catalysts were reformulated by replacing the Pd, Pt and Rh mixtures with optimized mixtures of rare-earth oxides (REOs). Laboratory studies demonstrated that these aged REO cata- lysts (80,000 km) with unleaded Chinese fuels reduce vehicle emis- sions by an average of 99%, 80% and 92% for CO, HC and NOx, respectively, when operating as a three-way catalyst in a closed-loop control mode at a stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio. REO catalysts with 7.6g/ft3 of precious metals were tested on in-use Chinese Volk- swagen Santanas with carbureted engine. Several strategies for air injection were tested on these vehicles. Emissions were reduced by an average of 70% for CO, 55% for HC and 30% for NOx using the ECE 15.04 drive cycle. The retrofit of in-use vehicles with REO cat- alysts can be effective when a system approach that includes a vig- orous I/M program, the right catalyst for a required conversion rate, proper location to place the catalyst and fuel quality. 2001-01-0226.

This paper describes the development and tests of a combined CO/O2 zirconia sensor for on-board diagnosis of oxidation catalysts. To achieve accurate measurements, preliminary model scale experi- ments have been carried out. These tests consist in careful calibra- tions with synthetic gases, measurements in exhaust gas from a lab- oratory scale lean premixed methane-air burner, and comparisons with classical and FTIR gas analyzers. Accordingly, a new sensor has been designed and prototyped. Held in a spark plug type hous- ing, it simultaneously monitors the CO, and O2 content of the exhaust gas. Over the wide O2 range of interest, model scale tests of the sensor with burnt gases have shown good agreement with lab- oratory analyzers. Closed loop experiments carried out with the same burner also demonstrate the CO/O2 probe potential for com- bustion control. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0227. (SP- 1590) High frequency measurements of pressure and temperature fluctuations in an automotive exhaust system during steady-state and transient driving conditions. J. R. McBride, P. W. Husak, J. A. Lockwood, and K. E. Nietering, Ford Research Laboratory. Environmental concerns have prompted increasingly stringent government legislation regulating automotive fuel economy and emissions. Recent rules not only mandate lower total emissions, but also require on-board diagnostics which monitor the vehicle exhaust systems. In order to satisfy these requirements, new and improved exhaust gas sensors are continually being developed to serve as part of the engine feedback control and emissions monitoring systems. Before we can properly design these new sensors, we must attempt to better understand the harsh environment in which they will oper- ate. In this paper, we examine the high frequency nature of pressure fluctuations found in the exhaust system for both steady state and transient engine operating conditions. We also investigate tempera- ture fluctuations, but restrict these measurements to the sampling environment found in the packaging of a Ford Si-based microcalori- meter. Results from these studies elucidate the physical limitations imposed by the sampling environment and should help to better define design specifications for new sensors. 2001-01-0228.

In preparation for compliance with California's SULEV standard and Euro STAGE 4 standard, which will take effect in 2002 and 2005, respectively, we have developed a laminated planar oxygen sensor. The developed sensor has the following characteristics: high thermal conductivity and superior dielectric characteristic, due to direct joining of the heater element alumina substrate and the sensor element zirconia electrolyte; low heat stress at temperature rise, due to optimized heater design; superior sensor protection from water droplets, and improved sensor response, due to optimized arrange- ment of intake holes in the sensor cover. With these characteristics, the developed oxygen sensor can be activated in 10 seconds after cold start. 33</page><page sequence="33">2001-01-0228-2001-01-0237 This report describes the technologies we used to develop the early-activation oxygen sensor. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0229. (SP- 1590) History of emissions reduction: Nor- mal emitters in FTP-type driving. Scott Austin and Marc Ross , University of Michigan. Information is readily available on how a vehicle model's emis- sions system performs under certification conditions, but it is not widely known how it performs after years of use. This study predicts the odometer dependence of in-use car emissions, in grams per mile (gpm), over many model years. To do this, model years are analyzed starting in the mid 1980s until the mid 1990s. High emitters are eliminated from the study using a vehicle probability distribution technique. Emissions data was obtained from EPA' s long-term Fed- eral Test Procedure (FTP) survey, AAMA, CARB's Light Duty Vehicle Surveillance Program (LDVSP 14), and University of Cali- fornia Riverside CMEM database. The UCR data includes second- by-second engine-out and tailpipe-out emissions. Emissions system durability was found by comparing the emissions of vehicles of the same model year at different odometer readings. This data was fit to a linear function, enabling the emissions of vehicles to be deter- mined at any odometer reading. The emissions of in-use vehicles were compared to the EPA certification standards at 50,000 and 100, 000 miles, enabling evaluation of the artificial aging process of vehicles tested in the FTP. Tailpipe and engine-out emissions data are used to model the Catalyst Pass Fractions (CPFs) and cold start performance. In addition, certification FTP performance is com- pared to the corresponding EPA emissions standards. From this comparison, the amount of "headroom" (normalized difference between tested emissions and emissions standards) is computed. We put the gpm emissions of normal emitters, which we have been dis- cussing, into context by briefly presenting estimates of emissions from the other sources: high emitters and driving patterns other than FTP-type. Thus we present an estimate of total "real-world" gpm emissions. 2001-01-0232. (SP- 15 89) Transient measurement in a gaso- line fuel cell fuel processor. Paul J. Berlowitz and Frank Hersh- kowitz, ExxonMobil Corporate Strategic Research; and Robert N. Carter and William Pettit, General Motors Corporation Global Alternative Propulsion Center. Fuel-cell-powered vehicles offer the potential of ultra-low or zero emissions along with very high efficiency. The major practical barrier to widespread introduction has been the need to provide hydrogen to the fiiel cell. On-board hydrogen storage is not practical at the current time, leading to a large research and engineering effort in developing fuel processors that convert a hydrocarbon fuel such as gasoline, methanol or methane into a hydrogen-rich reformate. A key component of these systems, all of which have multiple cata- lytic reactors, is the processor response to transient operation that is inherent to vehicle use. This paper reports on a research reactor system designed to measure the transient response of fuel proces- sors, and reports preliminary measurements of transient response for the primary reformer reactor of a gasoline fuel processor. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0233. (SP-1589) Integrated air supply and humidifi- cation concepts for fuel cell systems. S. Pischinger and C. Schön- felder, RWTH Aachen ; and W. Bornscheuer , H. Kindl , and A. Wiar- talla , FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. In this paper, different air management system concepts includ- ing mechanical superchargers and turbochargers are analyzed with regard to their suitability for fuel cell applications. Therefore a simu- lation model which takes the main mass, energy and heat flows in the fuel cell system including fuel evaporation, reformer, gas clean- ing, humidification, burner and compressor/expander unit into account was setup. For a PEM system with methanol steam reformer the best system efficiencies at rated power can be achieved with a turbocharger in combination with a tailgas burner for operating pres- sures between 2.5 and 2.8 bar. For pure hydrogen systems the best system efficiency is obtained with an electric driven supercharger for a maximum pressure of 2 bar and an appropriate pressure strat- egy during part load operation in the complete operating range. The increase of system efficiency for pressurized stack operation is mainly attributed to advantages with regard to water management. The inertia of the compressor significantly affects the air flow after a load step and thereby the dynamic system behavior. An integrated air supply and humidification concept offers significant potential with regard to the improvement of fuel cell systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0234. (SP-1589) New powerful catalysts for auto- thermal reforming of hydrocarbons and water-gas shift reaction for on-board hydrogen generation in automotive PEMFC appli- cations. Stefan Wieland, Frank Baumann, and Karl A. Starz , dme2 Degussa Metals Catalysts Cerdee AG. Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC) systems are clean and efficient power sources for mobile applications. The required anode feed gas hydrogen can either be stored as such or generated on- board the vehicle. The on-board reforming of hydrocarbon fuels like gasoline, diesel or light naphtha to generate the required hydrogen is attractive due to the existing production and infrastructure. Lack of the latter is a drawback for the use of hydrogen or methanol as energy source. One focus of research and development at dmc2 (Degussa Metals Catalysts Cerdee AG) is on catalyst systems for hydrogen generation and purification for mobile PEMFC applica- tions, particularly for autothermal reforming (ATR) of gasoline and methane, and for water gas shift (WGS) reaction. This paper reports on hydrogen productivity, selectivity, opera- tional stability, and dynamic response upon load change of precious metal-based catalysts for ATR and WGS reaction. The catalysts are supported on carriers like monoliths, foams or metallic substrates perfectly suitable for mobile applications, resulting in high specific activities to achieve high space-time yields. 2001-01-0236.

An ADVISOR model of a large sport utility vehicle with a fuel cell/battery hybrid electric drivetrain is developed using validated component models. The vehicle mass, electric traction drive, and total net power available from fuel cells plus batteries are held fixed. Results are presented for a range of fuel cell size from zero (pure battery EV) up to a pure fuel cell vehicle (no battery storage). The fuel economy results show that some degree of hybridization is ben- eficial, and that there is a complex interaction between the drive cycle dynamics, component efficiencies, and the control strategy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0237.

Methanol has many advantages as a fuel for fuel cells compared with hydrogen. The direct methanol type system consists of simple and compact equipment, and suited for automobile use. This research analyzed characteristics of power output and thermal effi- ciency in a direct methanol fuel cell.

The objective of this SAE paper is to discuss a power stage parti- tioning which will provide a cost effective and flexible Infineon Technologies solution to control future E- Valve applications.

(SP- 1599) Meta-CVD system - An electro- mechanical cylinder and valve deactivation system. Peter Kreuter , Peter Heuser, Joachim Reinicke-Murmann, Rüdiger Erz , Peter Stein, and Ulrich Peter, Meta Motoren- und Energie-Technik GmbH. A variable valve actuation mechanism suitable to activate and deactivate the intake and exhaust valves of reciprocating engines will be presented within this paper. This system called the "CVD System" (Cylinder and Valve Deactivation) allows a reliable activa- tion and deactivation of the valves of conventional cam-controlled valve trains within one engine cycle, independent of the oil feeding system. The system can be used for both the deactivation of single valves of multi-valve engines - e.g., to increase the in-cylinder charge motion -or the deactivation of complete cylinders of multi- cylinder engines. Different to the well known hydraulic valve shifting or switching devices the CVD system represents an electromechanical device with an unlocked (deactivated) position being mechanically offered to a solenoid operated coupling lever once per cam revolution. If valve deactivation is required the solenoid is switched on to cut the force line between cam and valve. This system can principally be applied to both types of rocker-arms valve trains, the overhead valve train and the push rod valve train. This paper describes the principle function of the CVD mecha- nism, showing examples for different applications. Results of simu- lations and experimental investigations will be presented to evaluate the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the system. The potentials of cylinder deactivation with the CVD system will be discussed on the base of thermodynamic test bench experiences and vehicle results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0241. (SP-1599) Single-cylinder engine tests of a motor-driven, variable-valve actuator. Rassem R. Henry, Delphi Research Labs. A novel mechanism concept for a fully flexible, motor-driven, cam-actuated engine valve was reported. It is capable of i) variable valve timing, ii) variable lift and iii) individual valve phasing con- trol. To check the validity of the concept in real engine environment, engine tests were performed using a single-cylinder of a modified six-cylinder 3.8-liter production engine, with the new motor-driven mechanisms replacing both valves. Firing tests of this engine, with equivalent valve profiles to the production profiles, yielded similar fuel consumption, lower NOx emissions but higher IMEP COV and HC emissions. Motoring tests demonstrated variable timing capabil- ity, low cycle-to-cycle valve lift-profile variation as well as low seating velocity and noise. Lessons learned from testing the system in a real engine environment are discussed in details and suggestions for future variable- val ve actuation concepts' requirements are offered. 2001-01-0243. (SP-1599) A study of a continuous variable valve event and lift (VEL) system. Shinichi Takemura, Shunichi Aoyama, Takanobu Sugiyama, Tsuneyasu Nohara, and Katsuya Moteki, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Makoto Nakamura, and Seino- suke Hara, UNSIA JECS Corp. A new variable valve actuation system that varies valve lift and timing events continuously has been devised and confirmed to sub- stantially improve power and reduce fuel consumption when applied to an SI engine. The variable valve event and lift (VEL) system is a simple mechanism consisting of oscillating cams and linkages, enabling it to operate the valves smoothly even at high speed. Its compact size facilitates application to direct-acting valve trains and its ability to vary valve lift from a deactivated state (0) to a large lift amount allows the system to be used with a wide range of engine concepts. In this study, VEL was combined with a phase shifting function to enable the valve lift characteristic to be varied virtually arbitrar- ily, and test results showed that fuel consumption of an SI engine was reduced by nearly 10%. This effect is attributed to lower friction loss due to the use of extremely small valve lift- timing events and reduction of pumping loss resulting from effective use of internal exhaust gas recirculation. The VEL system substantially improves combustion because the extremely small valve lift-timing events increase the intake air flow rate, which is also expected to be effective in reducing cold-start HC emissions. These results indicate that the VEL system has the poten- tial to achieve an SI engine that provides both low fuel consumption and low emissions. This paper describes the newly developed VEL mechanism and its effect on the performance of a V6 test engine fitted with the system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0244. (SP-1599) A continuous variable valve event and lift control device (VEL) for automotive engines. Makoto Nakamura, Seinosuke Hara, Yoshihiko Yamada, Keisuke Takeda, Naoki Okamoto, and Tsutomu Hibi, UNISIA JECS Corp.; and Shinichi Takemura, and Shunichi Aoyama, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes a new variable valve control device called VEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift Control Device), which enables continuous control of both valve events (opening duration) and valve lifts, from the lowest lift or deactivation state (0) to a long event and high lift state. VEL is composed of two subsystems. One is a mechanical valve train system, which converts crankshaft rotation into output cam oscillation via a transmission mechanism involving a rocker arm. The valves are moved by the output cam oscillation. The other is an electric-powered actuator system, which varies valve events and lifts according to driving conditions by controlling the angular posi- tions of a control shaft. This control shaft has a eccentric control cam inserted into the fulcrum cylinder of the rocker arm, so as to change the state of the transmission mechanism and the output cam. In VEL, the combination of a unique transmission mechanism and state change mechanism, make it possible to gain a great adjust- ment range of events and lifts. In addition, it involves a compact sys- tem that can be installed on existing DOHC direct-acting valve train engines without the need for any major cylinder head modifications. Furthermore, the adoption of the so-called desmodoromic (forced drive) principal for the transmission mechanism makes it possible to avoid additional springs or spring loads other than the existing DOHC valve train, so as to realize a simpler system structure. In addition, this principal and the improvement of the cam profile of the output cam make it possible to achieve smooth valve motion 35</page><page sequence="35">2001-01-0244-2001-01-0250 even at high speed, so as to increase the maximum power. Low valve spring loads based on this principal and low energy loss of the output cam oscillating make it possible to reduce driving friction at low speed in combination with small valve lift control, thus reduc- ing fuel consumption. VEL was actually applied to a V6 engine. Test results verified that the characteristics mentioned above are possible and that the actuator system provides excellent response for controlling valve events and lifts. This paper gives a concrete technical explanation, along with an account of verification results as well as evaluation results regarding VEL. In addition, the accompanying paper also gives an account of the effect of VEL on engine performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0245.

VarioCam Plus, by combining switchable valve lift curves with variable valve timing, allows a variable engine(two-in-one engine concept) to be realized, which yields maximum power and torque on the one hand and low pollutant emissions and fuel consumption on the other. This concept has been designed to largely exploit the inherent potential of fully variable valve timing systems. The dura- bility of the new mechanical components has been optimized and a new Motronic engine management system has been developed to account for the various control functions for the variable valve lift switching system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0246. (SP- 1599) A high dilution stoichiometric com- bustion concept using a wide variable spark gap and in-cylinder air injection in order to meet future CO2 requirements and worldwide emission regulations. Eric Olofsson, Per Alv estig, Lars Ber g sten, Martin Ekenberg , Anders Gawell , Anders Larsen, and Raymond Reinmann , Saab Automobile AB. Continuously Variable Cam Phasers (CVCP) controlling both the exhaust and intake camshaft phasing in combination with air assist direct fuel injection and a wide variable spark gap is utilized to reduce the fuel consumption for a 4- valve Turbo Charged (TC) Spark Ignition (SI) engine. The spark plug and the air-assisted direct fuel injector are inte- grated into one unit in order to facilitate packaging in a modern 4-valve combustion chamber. This integrated component is referred to as the Spark Plug Injector (SPI). CVCPs are used to reduce pumping work by diluting the charge with large amounts of residual exhaust gas. This strategy, along with stoichiometric homogeneous operation enables the use of a Three Way Catalyst (TWC), considered to be a prerequisite to meet the emission standards of Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV) II and beyond. The ignition quality deteriorates with increasing levels of resid- ual exhaust gas dilution. This is solved by applying a high energy ignition coil and a variable spark gap. The spark gap can be varied between 1 to 4 mm. In order to achieve an acceptable overall burning angle, a small amount of air, at 750 kPa absolute pressure, is injected into the com- bustion chamber via the SPI in the middle of the compression stroke. Results show that part-load Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) is decreased by approximately 10%.

Both the vari- able intake and exhaust control valves are operated by one servomo- tor. For high engine speeds, the exhaust collector pipe design for merging of each exhaust gas flow at 180 degrees phase difference is used. For mid engine speeds, the design for merging of each exhaust gas flow at 360 degrees phase difference is used. Two modes are provided to the intake control, and three modes are pro- vided to the exhaust control.

(SP- 1574) A keynote on future combustion engines. Hiromistu Ando and Kazunari Kuwahara, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. A characteristic mechanism of in-cylinder combustion is "time- domain mixing" which mixes up unburned gas, products in the dif- ferent stages of combustion process, and burned gas, by "eddy," a flow component with its scales of several to 10 mm. It seems to play a role in completing the combustion. Now that direct injection is a central engine technology, a keyword to combustion control is "freedom of mixing," that is, no restriction on mixture formation, realized by direct injection. Various kinds of combustion control technologies utilizing it, have been presented. After combustion control for a premixed leanburn gasoline engine, and a direct injec- tion gasoline engine, was achieved by turbulence control, and mix- ing control, respectively, the next target of combustion control will be ignition control. It will be possible, by controlling some boundary condition on combustion and fuel chemistry. Time-domain mixing and freedom of mixing will support it. A keyword to the future will be "freedom from boundaries" between combustion and fuel chemistry. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0249. (SP- 1574) Particularities of combustion in direct injection spark ignition engines. Cornel Stan, West Saxon University of Zwickau. The development of advanced techniques for an improved con- trol of scavenging, mixture formation and thereby of the combustion in IC engines is more and more supported by numerical simulation models. However, the benefits in reducing the specific fuel con- sumption and the pollutant emission are not spectacular. On the other hand, the recent evolution of the fuel cell systems - which let expect a commercial application for automotive propulsion in the next years - demonstrates a remarkable efficiency. There appears a challenge for the IC engines, considering the utilization of similar energetic sources for both systems. This imposes an accelerated optimization of the processes in thermal engines - the central prob- lem being the control of combustion. In this context, the basic mod- els should be reconsidered. The paper presents and discuss the spe- cific aspects of advanced mixture formation techniques by direct injection in SI engines, which could form the base of new combus- tion models - as initial configuration of numerical simulation. The main specific aspects for more realistic modeling are the non homo- geneity of components and phases during mixture formation, the mixture structure depending on load and speed, the partially super- posed processes of mixture formation and combustion, the complex heat transfer in different zones, the controlled autoignition process as well as multifuel applications. 2001-01-0250.

Calculations have been done under various conditions including both perfectly homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases, changing the degree of inhomogeneity. The results show that intake gas temperature is more dominant on ignition timing of HCCI than equivalence ratio and that there is a possibility to control HCCI by introducing appropriate temperature inhomogeneity to in-cylinder mixture. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0251. (SP- 1574) Controlled combustion in an IC- engine with a fully variable valve train. Don Law , Dan Kemp , Jeff Allen , Gary Kirkpatrick, and Ted Copland ', Lotus Engineering Ltd. Two methods have been achieved of facilitating controlled auto- ignition (CAI) combustion in a 4-stroke engine. This has been accomplished without the need to pre-heat intake air and was made possible through the use of the Active Valve Train (AVT) system. AVT was used to vary the amount of trapped exhaust gasses (other- wise known as exhaust residuals) inside the cylinder prior to the compression stroke. Both methods represent examples of internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). It was observed that the amount of internal EGR determined the combustion initiation point as a function of crank angle, thus demonstrating that both methods are controllable reproducible processes. Initial results (taken at 2000rpm and 3.5bar IMEP) show that this combustion significantly reduces NOx emissions to ultra-low levels compared to conven- tional spark ignition combustion. Data presented here represents the first published results of our internal EGR methodologies. At pres- ent, this combustion is being investigated across a wide range of engine speed and load points. This data will be published in the near future. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0252. (SP- 1574) Combustion characteristics of H2-CO-CO2 mixture in an IC engine. Toshio Shudo and Yasuo Nakajima , Musashi Institute of Technology ; and Koichiro Tsuga, JATCO Transtechnology Co. Reformed fuel from hydrocarbons or alcohol mainly consists of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The composition of the reformed fuel can be varied to some extent with a combination of a thermal decomposition reaction and a water gas shift reaction. Methanol is known to decompose at a relatively low temperature. An application of the methanol reforming system to an internal com- bustion engine enables an exhaust heat recovery to increase the heat- ing value of the reformed fuel. This research analyzed characteris- tics of combustion, exhaust emissions and cooling loss in an internal combustion engine fueled with several composition of model gases for methanol reformed fuels which consist of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Experiments were made with both a bottom view type optical access single-cylinder research engine and a constant volume combustion chamber. The thermal decomposition reaction produces lmol of carbon monoxide and 2mol of hydrogen from lmol of methanol, and the water gas shift reaction produces the same amount of hydrogen and carbon dioxide from carbon monoxide and water. Therefore, an increase in hydrogen means an increase in carbon dioxide, an inert gas with large heat capacity, and a decrease in the heating value of the fuel. This research cleared a balance of the combustion promo- tion by the increased hydrogen and the demerit by the increased heat capacity of mixture due to the increased carbon dioxide. The highest overall thermal efficiency including the exhaust heat recovery is obtained in the combustion of the methanol-reformed fuel with just the thermal decomposition reaction, which consists of 33% of hydrogen and 67% of carbon monoxide. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0253.

The present study is mainly motivated to investigate the vapor- ization, auto-ignition and combustion processes in the high-pressure engine conditions. The high-pressure vaporization model is devel- oped to realistically simulate the spray dynamics and vaporization characteristics in high-pressure and high-temperature environment. The interaction between chemistry and turbulence is treated by employing the Representative Interactive Flamelet (RIF) Model. The detailed chemistry of 114 elementary steps and 44 chemical species is adopted for the n-heptane/air reaction. In order to account for the spatial inhomogeneity of the scalar dissipation rate, the mul- tiple RIFs are introduced. Numerical results indicate that the RIF approach together with the high-pressure vaporization model suc- cessfully predicts the ignition delay time and location as well as the essential features of a spray ignition and combustion processes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0254.

Yasuki Tamura, Seiji Kikuchi, Koujiro Okada, Kazuo Koga, Takashi Doga- hara, Osamu Nakayama, and Hiromitsu Ando, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. An extensive effort has been made, at Mitsubishi Motors, in the technology field of new catalysts and of the catalyst reaction control for the purpose of further improvement of the emission control with the GDI engines. A new NOx-trap catalyst has been developed to satisfy the required higher catalyst performance under high- temperature condition. The new catalyst contains potassium (K) of excellent NOx-storage capacity under high-temperature region in the catalytic atmosphere, and to retain K stability zeolite is mixed in the catalyst layer as well as the substrate is coated with silica (SÌO2). This new catalyst has been proven of the improved NOx conversion efficiency, and solved the long-pending problems partic- ularly those experienced under high-temperature operation. In addi- tion to the NOx-trap catalyst, a new dual-layer three-way catalyst (hereinafter referred to TWC), using platinum (Pt) effective for HC emissions control, has been developed with the aim of improving HC emissions reduction in lean-combustion region, which fre- quently occurs in the GDI engine. In the field of the activation-control technology, several innova- tive technologies have also been created such as the controls of strat- ified slightly-lean combustion for faster catalyst light-off, of the purge-pulse injection and of oxygen (02)-storage control to improve the catalyst-activity efficiency, and of the assisted catalyst tempera- ture-rise to extended the sulfur-poisoning resistivity of the catalyst. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0255. (SP- 1574) Electronic controls - Breeding new engines. Richard K. Stobart, Bernard J. Challen, and Rob Bowyer, Arthur D Little/Cambridge Consultants. Internal combustion engines evolve based on the technical and economic pressures that surround their design and manufacture. Today, the perspective is one of overall effectiveness and not just specific technical performance. From the earliest internally fuel-burning engines, the process has been continually refined. Modern demands on both efficiency and emissions have raised the requirements significantly. Stricter perfor- mance limits, involving very accurate systems control, have has- tened the evolution of new forms of design. Electronic systems have become the heart of the unit, coordinating overall operation. We look forward here towards the next stages of evolution, where the powerplant is enabled almost entirely by software, making a new balance between the engine mechanical design and the control strat- 37</page><page sequence="37">2001-01-0255-2001-01-0261 egy. The level of engineering effort and time allocated to accom- plish the higher performance levels is reducing. The engineering process must therefore become more effective and more efficient - another challenge. We look at the future as involving a range of non-traditional operational schemes. Some are re-inventions, appearing since they are now achievable using electronic systems, others may be entirely new concepts that again are enabled through the greater reach that we have as a result of mechatronic systems (ones where there is an inseparable collaboration between the mechanical and the electron- ics.) One such example is HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition), which as an emerging engine technology offers the possi- bility of such a co-design approach. The control needs are accentu- ated by the absence of any "ignition" actuation. The engine requires precise control of temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio such that during the compression stroke, the burn occurs at the required point. Predictive approaches to control are thus essential, but the control system and the design of mechanical parts must be devel- oped synchronously. There is a further step forward, where the cali- bration process is developed and optimized alongside the design. 2001-01-0256. (SP- 1574) Engine control using a real-time combustion model.

The combination of physical models of an advanced engine con- trol system was proposed to obtain sophisticated combustion control in ultra-lean combustion engines, including homogeneous compres- sion-ignition and activated radical combustion with variable intake valve timing and a supercharger. Physical models of intake, com- bustion (including engine thermodynamics), and transmission were incorporated, in which the effects of residual gas from prior cycles on intake air mass and combustion and the effects of ineffective fuel on engine power were taken into consideration. Control of the in- cylinder air/fuel ratio, ignition timing and intake pressure was inves- tigated using simulations. 2001-01-0257. (SP- 1574) Controlling cyclic combustion vari- ations in lean-fueled spark-ignition engines. L. I. Davis , Jr., L. A. Feldkamp , J. W. Hoard , F. Yuan , and F. T. Connolly , Ford Research Laboratory; and C. S. Daw, and J. B. Green, Jr., Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This paper describes the reduction of cyclic combustion varia- tions in spark-ignited engines, especially under idle conditions in which the air-fuel mixture is lean of stoichiometry. Under such con- ditions, the combination of residual cylinder gas and parametric variations (such as variations in fuel preparation) gives rise to signif- icant combustion instabilities that may lead to customer-perceived engine roughness and transient emissions spikes. Such combustion instabilities may preclude operation at air-fuel ratios that would oth- erwise be advantageous for fuel economy and emissions. This approach exploits the recognition that a component of the observed combustion instability results from a noise-driven, nonlinear deter- ministic mechanism that can be actively stabilized by small feed- back control actions which result in little if any additional use of fuel. Application of this approach on a test vehicle using crankshaft acceleration as a measure of torque and fuel pulse width modifica- tion as a control shows as much as 30% reduction in rms variation near the lean limit. 2001-01-0258. (SP- 1574) IC engines for 100 miles/gallon cars. Herbert Heitland and Gerhart Rinne, Institut für Fahrzeugbau; Michael Willmann and Robin Vanhaelst, Forschung Volkswagen A.G.; and Krzysztof Wislocki, Technical Univ. The task of "around the world in 80 days on 1,000 liters of fuel" was successfully accomplished on the 3rd of August 2000. Volk- swagen has set up a formidable record with its Lupo 3L TDI, the world's first ever 3 liters car. In 80 days this car traveled 33,333 kilometers across 5 continents using only 792.57 liters of fuel. 2.38 liters per 100 kilometers, equal to 98.9 miles/gallon, at an average speed of 85.6 km/h, what has never been done before. Beside other features of the car and the drive train, credit must be given to the 1.2-liter diesel engine equipped with Unit Injectors. Further improvement of the fuel consumption and emissions might be reached with diesel-like and S.I.-like Stratified Charge engines as discussed in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0259. (SP-1585) Eliminating maps from engine fuel- ing control algorithms. David J. Stroh , Purdue Univ.; Matthew A. Franchek, Purdue University; and James M. Kerns, Ford Motor Co. Presented in this paper is an adaptive steady state fueling control system for spark-ignition internal combustion engines. Since the fueling control system is model based, the engine maps currently used in engine fueling control are eliminated. This proposed fueling control system is modular and can therefore accommodate changes in the engine sensor set such as replacing the mass-air flow sensor with a manifold air pressure sensor. The fueling algorithm can oper- ate with either a switching type O2 sensor or a linear O2 sensor. The steady state fueling compensation utilizes a feedforward controller which determines the necessary fuel pulsewidth after a throttle tran- sient to achieve stoichiometry. This feedforward controller is com- prised of two nonlinear models capturing the steady state character- istics of the fueling process. These models are identified from an input-output testing procedure where the inputs are fuel pulsewidth and mass-air flow signal and the output is a lambda signal. These models are adapted via a recursive least squares method to accom- modate product variability, engine aging, and changes in the operat- ing environment. This proposed fueling control system is demon- strated on a Ford 4.6L V-8 fuel-injected engine maintained at the Purdue Engine Research Facility/Engine Control Technology laboratory. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0260. (SP-1585) A production wide-range AFR con- trol algorithm for direct-injection gasoline application. Peter J. Maloney, Delphi Energy &amp; Chassis Systems. A wide-range Air-Fuel-Ratio (AFR) control algorithm was developed for production application in Direct Injection Gasoline (DI-G) powertrains. The algorithm controls AFR to a scheduled tar- get by modifying open-loop fuel injection timing duration using a Wide-Range AFR sensor measurement for feedback. A physically based hybrid State Estimator design was used to account for event-based engine delays and time-based sensor mea- surement characteristics to determine the error between target and measured AFR. The State Estimator was designed to minimize algo- rithm size, calibration burden, and engine controller throughput demand. A time-based, gain-scheduled Proportional-Integral control algorithm design was used to correct AFR errors. Non-physical estimation and control functions were designed for application with time-based updates to minimize engine controller throughput demand. Signal generator capabilities were built into the algorithm to facilitate three-way catalyst perturbation during stoichiometric con- trol, simulate unknown control system disturbances during algo- rithm calibration, and perform automatic catalyst efficiency sweeps. 2001-01-0261. (SP-1585) Active damping of engine idle speed oscillation by applying adaptive PID control. Bader Badreddine, Alex Zaremba, and Jing Sun, Ford Motor Co. ; and Feng Lin, Wayne State Univ. This paper investigates the use of an adaptive proportional- integral-derivative (APID) controller to reduce a combustion engine crankshaft speed pulsation. Both computer simulations and engine test rig experiments are used to validate the proposed control scheme. The starter/alternator (S/A) is used as the actuator for engine speed control. The S/A is an induction machine. It produces a supplemental torque source to cancel out the fast engine torque 38</page><page sequence="38">200 1 -0 1 -026 1 -200 1 -0 1 -0267 variation. This machine is placed on the engine crankshaft. The impact of the slowly varying changes in engine operating conditions is accounted for by adjusting the APID controller parameters on- line. The APID control scheme tunes the PID controller parameters by using the theory of adaptive interaction. The tuning algorithm determines a set of PID parameters by minimizing an error function. The error function is a weighted combination of the plant states and the required control effort. The tuning procedure is automatic and requires no human intuition or intervention. The algorithm is simple and can be easily implemented on-line as well as off-line. Two ver- sions of the tuning algorithm are presented and applied to the prob- lem of engine speed pulsation damping. One of them does not require the knowledge of the plant to be controlled; therefore, the control scheme becomes robust to plant changes. This type of tuning technique can be applied to a large class of linear and non-linear systems. 2001-01-0262. (SP- 1585) Air-to-cylinder observer on a turbo- charged SI engine with wastegate. Per Andersson and Lars Eriks- son , Linköping Univ. Observers for air mass flow to the cylinder is studied on a turbo- charged SI engine with wastegate. A position change of the waste- gate influences the residual gas mass and causes the volumetric effi- ciency to change, which produces a transient in the air mass flow the cylinder. Two standard methods of estimating air-to-cylinder are investigated. A new nonlinear air-to-cylinder observer is suggested with two states: one for intake manifold pressure and one for the off- set in in-cylinder air mass compared to expected through the volu- metric efficiency. The observers are validated on intake manifold pressure data from a turbocharged spark-ignited production engine with wastegate. 2001-01-0263. (SP-1585) High performance idle speed control applying the sliding mode control with H robust hyperplane. Mitsunobu Kajitani, Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd.; and Kenzo Nonami, Chiba Univ. The idle speed reduction is one of the important solutions for fuel economy improvement. However the idle speed reduction requires to improve the performance of idle speed control to prevent from the malfunctions such as the engine stall. In the mass production engines, the PID control is mainly used for the idle speed control because of easiness of the design. Recently there are many studies applying the linear control theory such as the LQG and H-infinity control to improve the performance. However there are few studies applying the nonlinear control theory, never- theless the idle speed control (ISC) system has non linear character- istics. So we have aimed to develop the high performance ISC applying the sliding mode control (SMC) representative in the non- linear control theory. In this study, first we experimentally identified the low order model of the ISC system. Second we designed three controllers applying the PID control, LQG control and SMC. Finally we com- pared them and consequently we could confirm that the controller applying the SMC with H-infinity robust hyperplane has the highest performance. 2001-01-0264. (SP-1585) Secondary O2 feedback using pre- diction and identification sliding mode control - Second report. Yuji Yasui, Shusuke Akazaki, Masaki Ueno, and Yoshihisa Iwaki, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. The Honda Accord is the world's first automobile meeting the SULEV category criteria in the LEV-II exhaust emissions standards. An improved accuracy engine control system and catalyst account for the automobile's extremely low emissions. The accuracy engine control system includes double adaptive air-fuel ratio feedback loops composed of STR (Self-Tuning Regulator), for primary air- fuel ratio control, and PRISM (Prediction and Identification Sliding Mode Control), for secondary O2 feedback. The basic algorithm of the latter was presented at SAE 2000. However, two issues required further PRISM algorithm improve- ments in order to apply the double adaptive loops to an actual vehi- cle. One such achievement is both the compensation for engine dynamic characteristics by PRISM and the avoidance of the recipro- cal interference with two adaptive loops. Another improvement is the identification of an exact controlled object model that provides the same frequency characteristics as that of a controlled object from the UEGO sensor upstream of the catalyst to the HEGO sensor downstream. Consequently, several algorithm improvements were introduced to the double adaptive loops discussed in this paper in order to resolve these issues. 2001-01-0265. (SP-1585) Impact of the proportional factors of electronic speed governor on diesel engine performance. Jerzy Larisch, Technical University of Lodz; and Maciej Sobie szczanski, Automotive Research and Development Center "BOSMAL". In the paper some experimental results concerned the influence of some electronic speed governor parameters on efficiency, exhaust smoke, exhaust emission, and dynamic behavior of diesel engine, have been presented. The research object was a six-cylinder direct injection diesel engine (100 kW at 2600 rpm, 6.54 dm3 swept vol- ume) with electronically controlled in-line fuel injection pump. Impact of proportional intensifying of fuel charge in relation to engine speed on engine performance has been studied. Four experi- mental tests were carried out for following engine operational condi- tions: idle, acceleration, rapid torque changes, and cycling torque changes. Following parameters have been analyzed: changes in engine speed, changes and vibrations of fuel rack, exhaust smoke, CO, HC, and NOx emissions, and some dynamic parameters. As the result, significant influence of the proportional factor value of elec- tronic speed governor has been proved. It has been concluded that the proportional factor has different qualitative and quantitative impacts on the considered parameters. It has been shown how the proportional factor values should be chosen according to diesel engine requirements. 2001-01-0266. (SP-1585) Further development of an Ion Cur- rent Combustion Control System (ICCS). Morito Asano, Atsushi Ito, Tetsuo Kuma, and Mitsunobu Kajitani, Daihatsu Motor Co.; and Manabu Takeuchi, Yoshiyuki Fukumura, and Mitsuhiro Izumi, Diamond Electric Co. As we developed Ion Current Combustion Control system (ICCS), we began to discover some issues of the ion current system. Depending upon combustion scenarios, the noise contributed to weak output characteristics and output variations making the com- bustion unstable. This paper intends to present methods developed to overcome these issues: SYSTEM HARDWARE - In the previous report, we described the issues on the detection sensitivities and noise proof characteris- tics. In this study, we further reviewed the system component designs to address those challenges. SYSTEM SOFTWARE - We have reported a learning method for the stable knock control for varying output characteristics. How- ever, there was a limitation in the application. Hence, we further analyzed the ion current characteristics, then developed a new algo- rithm to resolve this issue. This new system with the knock control and the misfire detection was introduced in 2000 MY. 2001-01-0267.

The basic torque structure is independent on the type of fuel and can be used for gasoline, diesel, or CNG injection systems. This allows better use of custom specific algorithms and facilitates reusability, which is supported by the graphical design tool that creates all mod- ules using automatic code generation. Injection specific algorithms can be linked to the software by simply setting a software switch. 2001-01-0268. (SP-1585) Preparing for CARTRONIC- Interface and new strategies for torque coordination and con- version in a spark ignition engine-management system. Bernhard Mencher, Holger Jessen , Lilian Kaiser , and Jürgen Ger- hardt , Robert Bosch GmbH. A major trend in modern vehicle control is the increase of com- plexity and interaction of formerly autonomous systems. In order to manage the resulting network of more and more integrated (sub) systems Bosch has developed an open architecture called CAR- TRONIC for structuring the entire vehicle control system. Structuring the system in functionally independent components improves modular software development and allows the integration of new elements such as integrated starter/generator and the imple- mentation of advanced control concepts as drive train management. This approach leads to an open structure on a high level for the design of advanced vehicle control systems. The paper describes the integration of the spark-ignition (SI) engine management system (EMS) into a CARTRONIC conform vehicle coordination requiring a new standard interface between the vehicle coordination and the EMS level. The main variable in this interface is the torque demand, which must be realized by the engine within a specified time interval. A set of characteristics contains further information about the desired vehicle action e.g., predicted torque, driver's request and desired speed. For the realization of an EMS compatible with the CARTRONIC interface the torque structure of the EMS must be modified. This means that torque demands independent of engine characteristics have to be processed on a vehicle coordination level while engine specific demands remain on the level of EMS coordination. Separating the source of torque demands from the path of torque conversion opens ways to improve torque conversion strategies. A suitable approach for such strategy is the selection of the actuating path based upon the torque related time interval using a charge dynamics model. The structure proposed in this paper defines the inter-face between vehicle coordination and a CARTRONIC compatible engine management system. Additionally, smart torque conversion strategies are introduced, which open up potential for improved driving comfort and further reductions in fuel consumption. 2001-01-0269. (SP-1585) An approach to torque-based engine management systems. N. Heintz, M. Mews , and G. Stier, Ricardo GmbH; A. J. Beaumont, Ricardo Inc.; and A. D. Noble, Ricardo Consulting Engineers. The ever-growing number of interacting electronic vehicle con- trol systems requires new control algorithms to manage the increas- ing system complexity. The paper describes a torque-based engine control architecture which uses a central torque demand variable to control the regulating qualities. This torque demand variable is the result of the coordination of all torque requests throughout the vehi- cle. Therefore, the system manages the whole process of prioritizing the torque demands of the different subsystems such as electronic stability or transmission control. If further vehicle subsystems have to be integrated, the structure can be easily extended as the torque demand variable is the only interface between the engine control algorithms and other vehicle control systems. 2001-01-0271. The case for new divided-chamber diesel com- bustion systems - Part one: Critical analysis of current DI and past significant divided-chamber engines. José F. Regueiro, Regueiro Engine Technologies, Inc. This first of three papers discusses the Diesel Industry's potential survival vis-a-vis future environmental demands; and why Divided Chamber systems may be warranted. Ignitability and startability are linked to valve-timing more than to Nominal Compression Ratio (CRn) or chamber design. A proper Air-Cycle is key, as overlap and I VC affect the Effective Compression Ratio (CRe) and Trapped Air- Mass (TAM). An in-depth historical review reveals why some Divided-Chamber engines started and idled well, while others did not; and how much the operational characteristics were penalized by poor prechambers, injection systems and valve-timing events. 2001-01-0272. Efficiency characterization of centripetal tur- bines under pulsating flow conditions. J. M. Lujan, J. Galindo, and J. R. Serrano, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia. A theoretical-experimental study is presented in the paper, whose objective is to propose a method that allows determining the average efficiency of the radial turbines, usually employed in the internal combustion engines, under real operating conditions. Due to the unsteady behavior of the exhaust gasses flow, the effi- ciency information obtained from steady flow tests cannot be con- sidered when the turbine is connected to an internal combustion engine. The efficiency differences between steady and unsteady flow patterns, can be obtained by testing the turbine, connected to the engine, under real pulsating flow conditions. For the correct turbine workflow characterization, a wave action model has been used, together with information obtained from engine tests. The engine test cell includes a specific measuring device for this purpose. The results obtained have been compared with those provided by the turbine manufacturer. In this way, it has been possible to quantify the efficiency differences due to the pul- sating behavior of the exhaust gases flow. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0273. Variable geometry system turbocharger for passenger car diesel engine. Akiko Kawamoto, Yukio Takahashi, Takaaki Koiken, and Fusayoshi Nakamura, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. The problem of the relationship between automobile emission and environmental pollution has attracted considerable attention lately. The variable swallowing capacity turbocharger becomes essential technology to cope with emission regulations and to decrease fuel consumption, while meeting the demand for increas- ing engine power output. A turbocharger with new structure has been developed for passenger car applications, the RHF series Vari- able Geometry System (VGS) turbocharger. The object of VGS tur- bocharger is to improve engine performance, over a broad engine speed range, by changing the swallowing capacity of turbine with a variable geometry nozzles. This paper describes the details of structure, performance and control of RHF series VGS turbocharger. Furthermore, a high tem- perature tribological study about the driving link is also discussed. 2001-01-0274.

Proposal of new supercharging system for heavy-duty vehicular diesel and simulation results of transient characteristics. Naoharu Ueda , Isuzu Motors Ltd.; Naohisa Mat- suda , Minoru Kamata, and Hiroshi Sakai, University of Tokyo ; and Hiroshi Kanesaka, Kanesaka Institute of Technology. Supercharging system is obviously a necessary technology for heavy-duty vehicular diesel to meet future stringent emission regu- lation as well as to improve fuel consumption characteristics. Although the conventional exhaust turbocharger system improves fuel consumption, there are some problems such as having a diffi- culty in improving starting acceleration and smoke emission charac- teristic because the response of an exhaust supercharger is not enough. On the other hand, the conventional mechanical superchar- ging system seems to be a quite effective aid for acceleration ability. However, it does not satisfy demand for low fuel consumption characteristic. 2001-01-0278. The case for new divided-chamber diesel com- bustion systems - Part three: Problems with current DI engines and divided-chamber solutions for future diesel engines. José F. Regueiro, Regueiro Engine Technologies, Inc. This paper discusses today's Dl-engine problems with fuel- injection hydraulics, swirl, improper valve-timing and Air Cycle; and the threats they pose to the industry. We believe that fresh Divided-Chamber designs, with new thinking on valve timing, injection, and the combustion process itself, can solve those prob- lems. This paper presents all-new four- val ve designs, with radial valves and radically-new central Prechambers or Energy-Cells; the last with new injection concepts; all with optional Variable Valve Timing/Variable Effective Compression Ratio (VVT/VECR). These approaches are designed to increase output with reduced fuel con- sumption, emissions and noise; providing, quickly and economi- cally, the alternative solutions needed for future engines. 2001-01-0279. Design and implementation of a new genera- tion of turbo charger test benches using hot gas technology. Detlef Naundorf and Holger Bolz, Kratzer Automation AG; and Michael Mandel, 3 K-Warner Turbosystems GmbH. Test benches equipped with hot gas generators are used for the development and optimization of turbochargers. The main compo- nent of a new turbocharger test system is a double fluted hot gas generator. This generator has the precision and flexibility to keep the temperature at the turbine inlet at a constant level and to guaran- tee constant mass flow and uniform pressure. The overall test sys- tem functions fully automatically. In what follows, we describe the construction of the new turbo- charger test bench and the equipment necessary for operating turbo- charger test benches in the context of an R&amp;D test center.

Mariti Larmi and Sten Isaksson , Helsinki University of Technology; and Seppo Tikkanen and Mika Lammila, Tampere University of Technology. A dual-piston, two-stroke, compression ignition free piston engine has been simulated with zero- and one-dimensional perfor- mance simulation codes. The simulation models used in the codes have been developed to analyze and improve the internal combus- tion engine process of a hydraulic free piston engine prototype. The prototype was designed and constructed in Tampere University of Technology at the Institute of Hydraulics and Automation. Perfor- mance simulation analyses were conducted in Helsinki University of Technology at the Internal Combustion Engine Laboratory. The zero-dimensional model is used for the simulation of piston dynam- ics. The one-dimensional model is used for performance simulation, especially for the simulation of gas exchange process. The simula- tion results were verified through prototype engine measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0281. Dynamic characteristics of viscous-friction dampers by simultaneous vibration displacement measurement at two points. Tomoaki Kodama, Katsuhiko Wakabayashi, and Yosuhiro Honda, Kokushikan Univ.; and Shoichi Iwamoto, W asada Univ. The dynamic characteristics of conventional viscous-friction dampers are investigated in this paper by adopting simultaneous vibration measurement method at two points. The vibration dis- placements of the damper casing and the inertia ring can be simulta- neously measured in this method. It has become possible that the more detailed dynamic characteristics of the viscous-friction damper can be grasped by the method. Especially, it is an effective method to grasp the behaviors of the inertia ring and the damper cas- ing for clarifying the effect of the silicone fluid on the torsional vibration of crankshaft system. The damper casing was made of acrylic resin in order to measure the behavior of the inertia ring on engine operation. It is possible to measure the torsional vibration displacements waveforms by the optical signals from pulse tapes stuck in both peripheral sides of the damper casing and the inertia ring. And, the dynamic characteristics of the silicone fluid were investigated by changing the viscosity of the silicone fluid and the clearance between the damper casing and the inertia ring. As the experimental results, it is shown in detail that the torsional vibration of the engine crankshaft system is greatly influenced by the periph- eral gap, the lateral gap and the viscosity of silicone oil of the vis- cous damper, and that the values of the peripheral and lateral gaps between the outside of the annular seismic - mass and the inside of the damper casing given by the widely-adopted BICERA's empiri- cal formula are not always optimum on the every viscosity of the filled silicone fluid of the viscous damper. 2001-01-0284. Cabin heat transfer and air conditioning capacity. You Ding and Robert Zito, Behr America, Inc. This paper describes a first-order differential equation that relates the cabin heat transfer coefficient, discharge panel temperature and discharge volumetric air flow to the average interior temperature. The solution to this equation leads to an overall understanding of automotive air conditioning designs and tests. Use of this solution in transient form can provide a relationship between interior temper- ature changes versus time during a typical cool down or idle test. Use of this solution in steady-state form provides the same under highway speed test conditions. Most importantly, this solution pro- vides a means to determine experimentally the overall heat transfer coefficient of any vehicle body style with different type of insulation materials. It is otherwise quite impossible to accomplish due to the complicated automotive body designs. Once the overall heat transfer coefficient is thus determined, it becomes a link between the demand from the air side and the supply from the refrigerant- side. The use of this methodology is four fold. First, the capacity of refrig- erant-side (sizing of components) can be determined based on the demand from the air side (functional objectives). Secondly, the actual A/C performance of an existing system can be evaluated from the components that are already in use by employing this method in reverse. Unless the performance of certain components is increased, repetitive testing does not improve system outcome. It bears some very significant economic considerations. Thirdly, this method also leads the establishment of unified validation procedures and requirements to various components. Lastly, an integrated approach can be developed to enhance computer simulation in both velocity and thermal fields. 2001-01-0287. The effects of air vents locations on the inter- nal climate control of vehicles. A. Aroussi and S. Aghil, University of Nottingham. The ventilation flow inside a one-fifth-scale model of a typical mid- size passenger compartment with a driver present has been investigated experimentally and computationally. In this study only one ventilation mode has been evaluated, namely the defrost mode in which air is discharged from two vents in the form of slits located 41</page><page sequence="41">200 1 -0 1 -0287-200 1 -0 1 -0295 along the top of the dashboard. The fluid measurements were taken using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique to acquire the velocity distribution of the model interior. The Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis have been implemented and simulated by using the commercial CFD code FLUENT as a tool to investigate the flow of the compartment's interior. Comparisons of the pre- dicted velocity field with experimental data show good agreement and were qualitatively consistent. The prediction of the velocity dis- tribution within the compartment show that the results obtained can be useful for optimizing the ventilation performance in the initial design stage to improve the thermal comfort of passengers. 2001-01-0289. An assessment of vehicle side-window defrost- ing and demisting process. A. Aroussi , A. Hassan , and B. R. Clay- ton, University of Nottingham; and B. S. AbdulNour, Ford Motor Co. The thermal comfort of passengers within a vehicle is often the main objective for the climate control engineer; however, the need to maintain adequate visibility through the front and side windows of a vehicle is a critical aspect of safe driving. This paper compares the performance of the side window defrosting and demisting mech- anism of several current model vehicles. The study highlights the drawbacks of current designs and points the way to improved pas- sive defrosting mechanisms. The investigation is experimental and computational. The experi- ments are carried out using full-scale current vehicle models. The computational study, which is validated by the experiments, is used to perform parametric investigation into the side window defrosters performance. The results show that the current designs of the side- defroster nozzles give maximum airflow rates in the vicinity of the lower part of the window, which yields unsatisfactory visibility. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0290. Condenser air pre-heating stand for develop- ment, validation, and continuous improvement testing of cli- mate control systems. James E. Ditsworth, Alexander V. Moul- tanovsky, and Bradley J. Yocum, Bergstrom Climate Systems, Inc. In the operation of vehicular air-conditioning systems, the tem- perature of the condenser inlet air has significant effects on system performance and operating characteristics. In some vehicles, engine cooling module (ECM) inlet air is supplied from the engine com- partment, subjecting the ECM to inlet air that is hotter than the ambient environment. In addition, vehicles in idle operation are sub- ject to ECM air recirculation that can also elevate the ECM inlet air temperature. In order to conduct development, validation, and continuous improvement testing of Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems under conditions simulating "real-life," a con- denser air pre-heating stand was built. 2001-01-0291. Some aerodynamic aspects of centrifugal fan characteristics of an automotive HVAC blower. Eui-Yong Kwon, Kyung-Wook Baek, and Nam-Hyo Cho, Institute for Advanced Engi- neering; and Han-Kyung Kim, and Ik-Jin Jung, Korea Delphi Auto- motive Systems Corp. Experimental and numerical approaches were adopted to under- stand flow behavior and performance of centrifugal fans in an auto- motive HVAC blower system. This work is directed at improving the performance of a conventional forward-curved centrifugal fan for a given small scroll casing. Recent requirements in the design of the multiblade centrifugal fan being used in automotive HVAC blowers are not only higher pressure rise and lower noise, but also better packaging in the automobile cabin. In order to meet these requirements, among various well-known design factors affecting the fan performance, principal parameters related to the rotor shape were modified and detailed flow analysis was carried out. Measure- ments have been made by means of a miniature five-hole probe and a pressure scanning system connected to an online data acquisition system. Computational results gave reasonably good predictions at the best efficiency operating point and verified the reliability of the present numerical approach. Based on the inspection of both mea- sured and predicted results of the conventional fan, design improve- ments were carried out in an acceptable operation range, giving con- siderable insight into what features of flow behavior were most important. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0292. Development of cabin air quality system. Yuji Honda, Hitoshi Ninomiya, and Yukiya Sassa, Denso Corp. In recent years, concern among car users regarding air quality has been steadily increasing. Pollen and diesel vehicle exhaust gases entering the cabin and smoke from fellow passengers not only reduce the quality of experience for everyone in the car, but are also harmful to the health. Therefore, we developed: 1 . A low pressure loss, dust-removing, selectively deodorizing filter that effectively absorbs malodor from diesel vehicle exhaust gas, without affecting A JC performance. 2. An automatic intake door control system that excludes outside exhaust gas 3. An optic catalytic air purifier with germ removal and long life deodorizing functions. We here report on the system combining these functions. 2001-01-0293. Analysis of factors affecting rainwater inges- tion into vehicles HVAC systems. S. A. A. Abdul Ghani and A. Aroussi, University of Nottingham; and E. Rice, Visteon Automotive Systems. The penetration of rainwater through the heating ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) of a vehicle directly affects the provision of thermal comfort within the vehicle passenger compart- ment. Present vehicle designs restrict considerably the air- management processes due to reduced space and tighter packaging. The motivation for the study is to get an insight into factors affecting the water ingress phenomenon when a stationary vehicle is sub- jected to water loading such as heavy rain when parked or waiting in a traffic light or when in a car wash. The test program made use of a compact closed circuit full-scale automotive climatic wind tun- nel that is able to simulate wind, rain and road inclination. The tun- nel was developed as part of the collaborative research between the Flow Diagnostics Laboratory (FDL) of the University of Notting- ham and Visteon Climate Control Systems. The study revealed some interesting findings and successfully draws conclusions and gives practical recommendations. 2001-01-0294. PIV measurement and numerical simulation of airflow field in a road vehicle HVAC cowl box. A. Aroussi and S. A. A. Abdul Ghani, University of Nottingham; and E. Rice, Visteon Automotive Systems. The analysis of airflow in an automotive HVAC cowl box is complicated by the cross sectional variations and abrupt changes in airflow direction. In this study, the complex three-dimensional tur- bulent flow found in a generic road vehicle cowl box is investigated experimentally and computationally. An optical anemometer is used to acquire the experimental data within a white metal sheet of a cowl box. The results are then used to validate and tune a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical cowl model. 2001-01-0295. Testing issues of automotive air-conditioning systems using R-744 (carbon dioxide) refrigerant. Thomas M. Głogowski, Donald T. Bracey, and Robert W. Ilecki, Sverdrup Tech- nology, Inc. Global environmental issues require that new alternatives to R-134a refrigerant be investigated by the automotive air- conditioning (A/C) industry. Test facilities must be able to handle the challenges that these refrigerants pose. One refrigerant currently under investigation is Carbon Dioxide (CO2). The high pressure and toxicity of CO2, require the test facility to institute more stringent 42</page><page sequence="42">2001-01-0295-2001-01-0301 guidelines and add equipment to safeguard personnel. The operating characteristics of this refrigerant, and the additional equipment needed for the test A/C system, necessitate more complex auto- mated test data acquisition and control. The addition of an internal heat exchanger in the CO2 A/C system is an example of the changes required. Different thermal characteristics introduced by this refrig- erants mean that new measurement devices such as higher-pressure transducers are required. Compatibility between test stand sealing materials, hose assemblies, etc., and the refrigerant must be addressed. Due to the research nature of R-744 refrigerant, the test facility must be flexible and robust enough to accommodate engi- neering challenges and changes in program direction. 2001-01-0296. Analysis of air ventilation performance based on aerodynamics simulation. Fuyuki Oshio , Kenichi Kurosaka, and Kenji Okumura, Daihatsu Motor Co ., Ltd. The shape and configuration of the air ventilation system deter- mines the ventilation performance while influencing the design and structure of a car. It is therefore necessary to decide the configura- tion of the air ventilation system in the early stages of design. We tried to analyze the pressure level of the ventilation ducts from the aerodynamics simulation results added to the cowl top which had the ventilation intake duct, and so on. Thus we succeeded in design- ing a new development process that can be used to predict the venti- lation performance in a shorter time without the use of prototypes. 2001-01-0297. Technical potential for thermally driven mobile A/C systems. Munther Salim, General Motors Corp. Aqua-ammonia absorption refrigeration cycle and R-134a Vapor jet-ejector refrigeration cycle for automotive air-conditioning were studied and analyzed. Thermally activated refrigeration cycles would utilize combustion engine exhaust gas or engine coolant to supply heat to the generator. For the absorption system, the thermo- dynamic cycle was analyzed and pressures, temperatures, concen- trations, enthalpies, and mass flow rates at every point were com- puted based on input parameters simulate practical operating condi- tions of vehicles. Then, heat addition to the generator, heat removal rates from absorber, condenser, and rectifying unit, and total rejec- tion heat transfer area were all calculated. For the jet-ejector system, the optimum ejector vapor mass ratio based on similar input parame- ters was found by solving diffuser' s conservation equations of conti- nuity, momentum, energy, and flow through primary ejector nozzle simultaneously. Then, similar to the absorption system, various parameters were computed and preliminary sizing of nozzle and dif- fuser throats was also presented. For the absorption system, genera- tor high-grade energy requirements were compared to the engine's exhaust heat energy. It was concluded that the exhaust heat is enough to activate the generator to produce cooling power up to 1 .4 tons of refrigeration. On the other hand, the jet-ejector system gener- ator heat requirement, which could be either from engine jacket low- grade coolant or high-grade exhaust gas, was compared to waste heat energy from both sources. It was found that the engine jacket coolant is superior to exhaust heat energy in generator activation. The engine jacket coolant contains enough energy to activate the generator for all of the engines considered while the exhaust heat energy was able only to produce cooling loads up to 1.4 tons of refrigeration. Based on the analysis, it is clear that both systems are possible future candidates as a replacement to vapor compression system. However, the jet-ejector system might be advantageous and more promising method over the absorption system when consider- ing factors such as waste-heat energy availability, complexity, tox- icity, mass, leakage, refrigerant choice, reliability and COP. 2001-01-0298. (SP- 1595) Evaluation of high-intensity dis- charge automotive forward lighting. John Van Derlofske, John D. Bullough, and Claudia M. Hunter, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. An experimental field investigation is described that compares off-axis (peripheral) visual performance between high-intensity dis- charge (HID) forward lighting and halogen systems. The goal of the investigation is to determine if the higher off-axis intensity levels combined with the spectral properties of HID lamps provide any benefits to visual performance over conventional tungsten halogen lamps. In this study three current production European headlamp sys- tems, one HID and two halogen, are compared. These systems are used to illuminate a fixed scene. Subjects perform a visual tracking task, cognitively similar to driving, while simultaneously small tar- gets located at various angles in the periphery are activated. Subjects release a switch upon detection and reaction times and missed sig- nals are measured. From the results, comparisons are made among the HID and halogen systems in terms of reaction time to signals at different peripheral angles, and in terms of numbers of missed signals. The results are compared to a model that predicts visibility at nighttime (mesopic) light levels. Potential implications of the results on driv- ing safety and on the development or refinement of forward lighting standards are discussed. 2001-01-0299. (SP- 1595) System strategies and technology for improved safety and comfort with adaptive headlamps. Michael Hamm and Ernst-Olaf Rosenhahn, Automotive Lighting. The introduction of innovative new technologies is related to aspects of safety and to human factors as comfort level and visual appearance. The intelligent headlamp system that is currently being developed allows the combination of the different aspects of driving comfort and safety. The top performing headlamp generations of the future will be the successors of the today's standard low beam. By using the sensor information available in the car, the light distribution will be adapted to different driving situations and generate an optimized light distribution. Relaxed and safe driving is the goal. Investiga- tions concerning adaptive headlamps are presented. Highway, coun- try road, curves and turning situations are examined by investigating detection distances of standard objects and by rating safety and com- fort. Photometric measurements rating glare effects during curve road driving for different headlamp control algorithms are carried out. This investigations show that adaptive curve lights can reduce glare by using suitable curve light parameters. On the basis of all results the improved safety and comfort for nighttime driving by using intelligent adaptive headlamps can be quantified. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0300. (SP- 1595) Calculation of nighttime road image under automotive headlamp lights. Hyun-Ju Song and Kuk Sakong, Samlip Industrial Co., Ltd.; Cheol-Hee Lee, Kyungwoon Univ.; and Yeong-Ho Ha, Kyungpook National Univ. This study proposes a new calculation method for generating real nighttime lamp-lit images. In order to improve the color appearance in the prediction of a nighttime lamp-lighted scene, the lamp-lit image is synthesized based on spectral distribution using the esti- mated local spectral distribution of the headlamps and the surface reflectance of every object. The principal component analysis method is introduced to estimate the surface color of an object, and the local spectral distribution of the headlamps is calculated based on the illuminance data and spectral distribution of the illuminating headlamps. HID and halogen lamps are utilized to create beam pat- terns and captured road scenes are used as background images to simulate actual headlamp-lit images on a monitor. As a result, the reproduced images presented a color appearance that was very close to a real nighttime road image illuminated by single and multiple headlamps 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0301. (SP- 1595) Evaluation of automotive stop lamps using incandescent and sweeping neon and LED light sources. John D. Bullough, John Van Derlofske, and Hua Yan, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 43</page><page sequence="43">2001-01-0301-2001-01-0310 This paper describes a study of visual responses to center high mounted stop lamps (CHMSLs) using a newly developed sweeping neon lamp. This study compares sweeping neon, incandescent, and light-emitting diode (LED) technologies. The incandescent CHMSL was a conventional after-market CHMSL brake light. The sweeping neon CHMSL used a novel controller whereby the luminous signal started at the center of the neon tube and grew in a "sweeping" motion outward toward the ends of the tube at an adjustable rate. The sweeping LED CHMSL had a segmented display simulating the sweeping characteristics of the neon CHMSL. Both the neon and LED CHMSLs had faster onset times than the incandescent CHMSL. Experimental subjects performed a tracking task cogni- tively similar to driving, and released a flip switch upon detecting the onset of the CHMSLs, which were mounted so as to be seen peripherally. Reaction times and missed signals for incandescent and for sweeping neon and LED CHMSLs are presented for simu- lated daytime driving conditions. Such data permit comparisons among CHMSL technologies to examine if sweeping neon technol- ogy result in any visual benefits, and to optimize signal characteris- tics for minimizing reaction time and the likelihood of missed signals. 2001-01-0302. (SP- 1595) Measurements and ratings of HID headlamp impact on traffic safety aspects. Ernst-Olaf Rosenhahn and Michael Hamm , Automotive Lighting. High intensity discharge lights (HID) are the innovation step that is now beginning to penetrate in all car classes. Investigating driv- ers, all results show that the benefits are visible to them and posi- tively accepted. The quantification of the improvements has yet been insufficiently examined. In this article some of the aspects will be highlighted. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0303. (SP- 1595) Evaluation of adaptive light distri- butions with AFSim. Alexander von Hoffmann , Volkswagen AG. European car manufacturers, setmakers and research institutes have been working for the last decade on Adaptive Frontlighting Systems (AFS). Due to the fact, that an AFS is no longer a single part of the car, it will have to be regarded in systems context with sensor and control devices resulting in a rising complexity. In order to help the engineer in developing an AFS, the software- tool AFSim has been programmed providing functions to swivel and to dim the light-distribution of a headlight on a freely programmable road with curves. The software package AFSim has been recently expanded with further functions facing the range of a headlight. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0306. (SP- 1579) Supply chain management: Responding to 'offsite' environmental management. Steven B. Young , Kevin Brady , and Andrea J. Russell, Five Winds Interna- tional. Product manufacturers are placing new and detailed environmen- tal requirements on their suppliers. These supply-chain management (SCM) initiatives include both compulsory and voluntary require- ments, such as requirements for Environmental Management Sys- tems (EMS), Design-for-Environment (DfE) programs, restricted material conformant, take-back commitments, or performance dis- closures. In effect, environmental management is no longer limited to site-specific concerns of emissions and waste. Newer product- focused issues now cover issues beyond the site, from product com- position, materials selection, recyclability, product-use, to product take-back. In addition, supplier verification of requirements is becoming an important consideration. These trends are illustrated based on experiences and databases with existing company pro- grams in automotive, electronics, telecom, consumer goods and other sectors. A framework for SCM environmental information is outlined, with an eye to demonstrating opportunities and value-added. 2001-01-0307. Shredder residue treatment and use today and in the future. Frank E. Mark, Dow Europe SA; and Pierre Picot, IXAS Conseil.

Lam, M. Sher- wood, and L. H. Shu, University of Toronto. This paper describes the development of a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) modified to support design for remanu- facture. The results of the waste-stream analysis of an automotive remanufacturer were used for this FMEA. The remanufacturer waste stream was assessed to determine factors that impede the reuse of parts. The use of the modified FMEA allows consideration of fac- tors such as ease of detection and repair of failure, in conjunction with contribution to the waste stream of each failure mode, to develop priorities in design for remanufacture. 2001-01-0309. Oriented polypropylene for automotive appli- cations. Walter Michalchuk, Stewart Hughes, Jeff Ross, and Phil Bates, Royal Military College of Canada; and Frank Maine, SHW Technologies Inc. An exploratory study was performed to determine the feasibility of using oriented polypropylene rods as a replacement for metal in side impact beam applications. The study was divided into four phases: (i) laboratory testing of the impact and tensile properties of oriented polypropylene coupons, (ii) design of an oriented polypro- pylene side impact beam of comparable rigidity to that of a metal beam but with significant weight savings, (iii) development of a means of attaching the polymeric bar to the vehicle and (iv) flexural testing of a scaled down prototype. The oriented polymeric and metal beams exhibited comparable stress-strain behavior during scaled down testing. Although more research is required to validate the design of an oriented polymer side impact beam, the encourag- ing results suggest that oriented polymers should be considered for use in automotive components that can make use of their high spe- cific strength and stiffness. 2001-01-0310. Material model development for impact analy- sis of oriented polypropylene foam structures. Scott T. Burr and Gavin D. Vogel, Dow Automotive. Federal legislation for head impact protection in upper automo- tive interiors (FMVSS 20 1U) has presented a unique energy man- agement problem for the automotive industry. Due to extremely tight packaging conditions, energy absorbers are required to have efficiencies which exceed those of traditional foam materials, and force the development of new methods of energy absorption. The push toward shortened design cycle times has required the use of predictive engineering tools such as finite element analysis. Predictive tools which can accurately drive design direction reduce design cycle times, costs associated with multiple prototype part builds, and costs associated with physical testing. Over the last few years, the inclusion of FMVSS 201U energy absorbing countermea- sures in the upper interior trim has been largely experimental in nature, yielding solutions which are costly in both time and money. This paper presents a characterization for a class of oriented poly- propylene foams which have orthotropic properties, and exhibit energy absorption efficiencies in the range of 80%-90%. Material characterization data was processed for input into the LS-DYNA® explicit finite element code. Completed material models were used to generate predicted response characteristics of oriented foam structures under FMH (free motion headform) testing, allowing comparison between predicted and experimentally measured responses. 44</page><page sequence="44">200 1 -0 1 -03 1 3-200 1-01-0319 2001-01-0313. Development of a technique to strengthen body frame with structural foam. Kyoso Ishida, Mitsugi Fuka- hori, Katsunori Hanakawa, Hideaki Tanaka , and Kenji Matsuda, Mazda Motor Corp. A technique to strengthen body frame with a polymeric structural foam has been developed with benefits of reducing vehicle weight and improving drivability and fuel economy. The idea of this new technology was evolved from the concept that body frame strength will increase drastically if the body frames are prevented from fold- ing on collision. The energy of a collision impact would be effec- tively absorbed if weak portions of body frames are reinforced by a high strength structural foam. The new technology composed of the high strength structural foam and a light-weight frame structure with partial foam filling is reported here. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0314. Modeling methodology of tearseams for invisi- ble PSIR systems. J ay a Das , GE Plastics. Automotive interiors are undergoing rapid transformation with the introduction of invisible PSIR integral systems. This styling trend requires continuous class A surface for the Instrument Panel (IP). This introduces complexities in the design and analysis of PSIR integral systems. The most important criterion for airbag doors is that it must open as intended, at the tearseam, within the deploy- ment temperature range and without fragmentation. Consequently it is imperative that in analytical simulations, the finite element model of the tearseam is accurate. The accuracy of the model is gov- erned by (a) optimal level of refinement, (b) surface geometry repre- sentation and (c) material model. This paper discusses modeling methodology for tearseams with respect to mesh refinement and the effect of geometry. To accurately predict impact performance and failure of the tearseam, the material at the tearseam and the entire IP system has to be characterized and its failure criteria included in the analytical material model. The methodology for creating an accurate analytical material model has been discussed in "Material Characterization for Predicting Impact Performance of Plastic Parts." Molded-in tearseams are subject to thin-wall molding conditions and this has been explored in "Predict- ing Material Processing Degradation." 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0315. Material and process options in pre-colored soft interior thermoplastics. Ryan T. Truong, Vi-Chem Corp. Contemporary interior designs make increasing use of soft feel and color harmony to provide a more luxurious and attractive envi- ronment for the driver and passengers. At the same time, progress in part manufacturing methods has increased the need for materials designed to work well in a variety of processes, such as injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, rotational molding and others. The focus of this paper will be on materials which are pre- colored to match OEM standards and are therefore capable of pro- ducing "ready-to-install" components without expensive post- operations like painting. The materials discussed will be in the 55-90 Shore A hardness range typically preferred by designers today, thereby avoiding the undesirable hard, "plastic" impression some other materials require as a trade-off. Plasticized PVC is often used in these applications for its good balance of performance and cost. This paper will also cover alternate materials for designs where multiple material compatibility, part performance or non-technical reasons favor other selections. 2001-01-0316. Air-bag pillar covers. José Guedes , Fernando Vilaça , and Cristina Veloso , Plasfil (PT); and Baranda Ribeiro , University of Coimbra (PT). The curtain air-bags dissemination requires that a new generation of pillar cover should be defined and developed. Those new cover pillars should complete all the requirements of the car industry for those security parts but also have a fair price. The US 571.201 norm and the Recycling European Parliament and Council Proposal for vehicles in useful end of life (2000/5 3/CE) should also be considered. That was the task that Plasfil (Portugal) imposed on itself. To define a product and its production process that could allow the introduction of the cover pillar even in low price cars, so that Plasfil, after testing some alternative possible "orienta- tion," defined the technologies. For that Plasfil has required techni- cal cooperation and development support to some raw material pro- ducers and to some reinforcement material and fabrics and leather companies and also to a mold maker (Portugal) and to two Universi- ties. The presentation will show the development process that allows us to start fixing the specification and how we must find the solution that includes materials, part design, mould and process. The cover pillars price produced with this technology will be 10-20% cheaper than those produced with back injection molding/in mold lamination. 2001-01-0317. (SP- 1595) A 360x226 pixel CMOS imager chip optimized for automotive vision applications. Frank J. Schauerte , John R. Troxell , and Randy A. Rusch , Delphi Delco Electronics Sys- tems; and Larry M. Oberdier, and Marie I. Harrington , Delphi Research Labs. Multiple automotive systems are now being developed which require an imager or vision chip to provide information regarding vehicle surroundings, vehicle performance, and vehicle passenger compartment status. Applications include lane departure, lane track- ing, collision avoidance, as well as occupant position, impaired driver, and occupant identification. These applications share many requirements, including robust design, tolerance for the automotive environment, built in self-test, wide dynamic range, and low cost. In addition, each application has unique requirements for resolution, sensitivity, imager aspect ratio, and output format. In many cases, output will go directly to vehicle systems for processing, without ever being displayed to the driver. Commercial imager chips do not address this wide spectrum of requirements. A CMOS imager chip has been designed to address these unique automotive requirements. An automotive grade, 1.2 micrometer minimum feature size pro- cess, which offers proven automotive environmental durability, has been used to fabricate two prototype imager chips. Results for both 128x128 pixel array chips and 360x226 pixel array chips are docu- mented. Both chips incorporate capabilities for enhanced dynamic range, near infrared light sensitivity, and support for on-chip vision processing functions. Chip images are documented using Lab VIEW®. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0318. (SP- 1595) Automatic vehicle high-beam headlamp control system. Joseph S. Stam, Gentex Corp. Automating the task of high beam switching will significantly improve nighttime driving safety, especially for pedestrians, by pro- viding the maximum amount of illumination possible for a given driving condition while not exposing an oncoming or preceding driver to an uncomfortable level of glare. While there have been many prior attempts to perform this task, these systems have been plagued by their inability to detect distant taillamps and by their ten- dency to switch to low beams for reasons other than the presence of other vehicles. This paper will describe a new device which over- comes these limitations through the use of an image processing sys- tem which detects other traffic and switches the high beams accordingly. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0319.

The primary colors red, green and blue are enhanced with increased saturation, making them easier to see at low levels of illu- mination. Preliminary results indicate that "spots in your eyes" are reduced in intensity and in duration in the visual field. Apparent glare is reduced by a factor of 6 to 7 compared with standard lamps. 2001-01-0320. (SP- 1595) Driving in snow: Effect of headlamp color at mesopic and photopic light levels. John D. Bullough and Mark S. Rea, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute . Many individuals believe that yellow headlights are preferable to white headlights when driving at night during a snowfall. Although evidence exists to support the claim that yellow light can be perceived as less "glaring" or "distracting" than white light of equal luminance, it is not clear whether backscattered light of differ- ent colors are differentially effective for driver comfort or for driver performance. This study investigates a potential mechanism that could support the supposed benefit of yellow headlamps for reduc- ing the detrimental effects of backscattered light to drivers at night. The results suggest that under low light levels when the visual field is dominated by a dynamic field of visual "noise" (like that caused by backscattered light from falling snow), performance of a tracking task similar to driving is reduced in accordance with the scotopic (rod-stimulating) content of the visual noise. Contrary to conven- tional understanding, rods might affect performance up to lumi- nances of 65 cd/m2. 2001-01-0321. (SP- 1595) Non-planar rearview mirrors: The influence of experience and driver age on gap acceptance and vehicle detection. Alexander P. de Vos and Richard van der Horst, TN O Human Factors ; and Michael Perel, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Non-planar driver's side rear-view mirrors provide a wider field- of-view than planar mirrors, but produce a minified image. A field experiment was conducted to measure the performance of drivers when making lane change decisions based on mirror information. Four mirror types were included: a planar mirror, a spherical convex mirror and two aspherical mirrors (radius of curvature 1400 and 2000 mm, respectively). Non-planar mirrors improved drivers' detection of adjacent vehicles due to wider fields of view. Drivers' experience with non-planar mirrors did not generally compensate for the negative effect of accepting smaller gaps, with the exception of drivers who were accustomed to spherical convex mirrors. No increase in the visual workload was required to process information in non-planar mirrors. The conclusion was that the relative benefits of non-planar mirrors should be greater than the negative effects. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0322. (SP- 1595) The role of binocular information for distance perception in rear-vision systems. Michael J. Flan- nagan, Michael Sivak, and Julie K. Simpson, University of Michi- gan. New developments in the use of two-dimensional displays to supplement driver vision have made it more important to understand the roles that various distance cues play in driver perception of dis- tance in more conventional ways of viewing the road, including direct vision and viewing through rearview mirrors. The current study was designed to investigate the role of binocular distance cues for perception of distance in rearview mirrors. In a field experiment, we obtained data to estimate the importance of binocular cues for distance judgments under conditions representative of real-world traffic. The results indicate that, although binocular cues are poten- tially available to drivers, these cues probably play little or no role in distance judgments in rearview mirrors in normal driving situa- tions. The present results therefore suggest that the lack of stereo- scopic depth cues in two-dimensional displays used as alternatives to rearview mirrors is not likely to have negative effects on drivers' judgments of distance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0323. Dynamic property response of polyurethane foam as a function of test frequency. Brian L. Neal, Bayer Corp. Comfort performance has developed into a central theme of vehi- cle seating design due to the role of the seat as the interface between the vehicle and the human. These comfort performance require- ments exercise considerable influence over the specifications of the polyurethane foam that serves as a primary load-bearing material in the seat assembly. Various test protocols have been established to measure and predict comfort performance for polyurethane foam. One of the most important test methods is the vibration transmissiv- ity test, used to characterize the response of a material to vibration of varying frequency and energy. This test methodology measures the performance of polyurethane foam alone to the performance of a fully assembled seat in a vehicle driven on a road surface. As such, there are a variety of test conditions employed to characterize trans- missivity performance. However, the results from these various tests can be quite differ- ent depending on the test conditions employed. Furthermore, most tests measure comfort properties at some standard deflection, or pressure, which is nominally designed to represent the average pop- ulation that will be riding on the seat. Missing from these tests is a recognition that foam comfort properties are not the same at all deflections, and thus performance and perceived comfort will change as a result of the size and shape of the person riding the seat. This research presents information demonstrating the dependence of comfort properties, such as vibrational transmissivity and quasi- static hysteresis, on foam thickness. In addition, the effect of pres- sure is demonstrated using various masses for the transmissivity testing. Finally, two commonly employed transmissivity test proto- cols' results will be compared. This work will be analyzed and dis- cussed from the perspective that comfort properties may need to be defined relative to the sitting pressure of the person riding on the vehicle seat. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0324. All thermoplastic lightweight structural rear- seat-back. Vika s Gupta, Mick Heckert, Jane Palmieri, Greg Korch- nak, Eric Kurtycz, and Mansour Mirdamadi, Dow Automotive. An innovative seat back design for fold down split-rear seat backs has been developed for application in SUV's, MPV's and hatchbacks. The all-thermoplastic seat back design meets US and European government regulations such as, the FMVSS 210, 207 in the US, and ECE 17 (luggage retention) in Europe. It is also expected to meet the newly introduced FMVSS 225 (child seat belt tether load) requirement. Currently application of the blow-molded seat back is limited to sedans where the seat belt anchor loads are transmitted to a steel package shelf. For applications where the seat-belt anchor loads are transmitted to the seat back, hefty steel frame and reinforcements are required which add weight and cost to the seat back. The same is true for seats that need to comply with the European luggage retention requirement. This newly developed thermoplastic seat back solution meets the above-mentioned requirements along with delivering significant cost and weight savings as compared to the traditional steel designs. The paper presents the design details, analytical prove out of the design, economic, and manufacturing considerations. 2001-01-0325. Advances in polyurethane foam property con- trol. James T. McEvoy, Johnson Controls Inc. Historically, polyurethane foam has been classified and deter- mined by IFD (Indentation Force Deflection) and density. The IFD test measures the load-bearing property of the foam at a given deflection. However, the expectation of the automotive specifica- tions is that these properties will also define durability and comfort of the foam when used in complete seat applications. Today's auto- motive customers are asking for vehicles that last longer, with higher expectations in comfort, appearance, and durability perfor- mance. New targets are vehicles that will have satisfactory perfor- 46</page><page sequence="46">200 1 -0 1 -0325-200 1 -0 1 -0332 mance for 150,000 to 200,000 miles. We at Johnson Controls believe that to achieve these types of customer performance stan- dards, new definitions of the molded foams are required. This paper will explain how a new test measurement, called hys- teresis loss, is required to meet these new customer requirements. This paper compares the hysteresis loss test, and IFD test, for gauge repeatability, time from manufacture to reliable test results and as a measure of durability. In addition, the paper will discuss how to make identical foams using different technologies, different manu- facturers and locations, and modeling how to change the hysteresis loss. The conclusion of the paper is that as we attempt to achieve the customer's higher expectations of a better more durable seat, we need to utilize the hysteresis test method, rather then IFD and den- sity to grade performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0326. (SP- 1620) Saturn engine stop-start system with an automatic transmission. Goro Tamai , Tony Hoang , Joel Tay- lor , Christopher Skaggs , and Bob Downs , General Motors Corp. Due to environmental and legislative concerns, less polluting and more efficient vehicle powertrain systems must be developed. A first step is a simple, low-cost system such as the presented Engine Stop-Start (ESS) system. A 1.9-liter four-cylinder spark-ignition engine with a four-speed automatic transmission was modified to enable fuel off-on transitions during decelerations and stops. Addi- tional hardware includes a 7 kW electric motor-generator, a power electronics module with an inverter and a DCDC converter, a 36 Volt nominal battery system, and minor modifications to the trans- mission. A control scheme was developed which takes advantage of the system's fuel saving potential while minimally affecting drivea- bility.

Hiroshi Hosoi, Yukio Nakamura, Kunihiko Sato , Katsuhiko Aoyama, Norikazu Kodama, Kazuhiro Iwahashi, and Tarou Ikeya, Toyota Motor Corp. The design of the newly developed Toyota AZ series 4-cy linder engine has been optimized through both simulations and experi- ments to improve heat transfer, cooling water flow, vibration noise and other characteristics. The AZ engine was developed to achieve good power performance and significantly reduced vibration noise. The new engine meets the LEV regulations due to the improved combustion and optimized exhaust gas flow. A major reduction in friction has resulted in a significant improvement in fuel economy compared with conventional models. It also pioneered a newly developed resin gear drive balance shaft. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0328. (SP-1620) Development of Nissan's new gener- ation 4-cylinder engine. Shunichi Inamijima, Toshihiro Ninomiya, Shinji Kawai , Takashi Igarashi, and Sadayuki Yonetamari, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes the new inline 4-cylinder QR engine series that is available in 2.0-liter and 2.5-liter versions. The next- generation QR engine series incorporates new and improved tech- nologies to provide an optimum balance of power, quietness and fuel economy. Its quiet operation results from the adoption of a com- pact balancer system and the reduced weight of major moving parts. Power and fuel economy have been enhanced by a two-stage cool- ing system, a continuous variable valve timing control system, a dual close coupled catalyst system, electronic throttle control and an improved direct-injection system. The latter includes an improved combustion chamber concept and improved fuel spray characteris- tics achieved by driving the injector by battery voltage. A light- weight and compact engine design has been achieved by adopting a high-pressure die-cast aluminum cylinder block, resin intake man- ifold and rocker cover and a serpentine belt drive. 2001-01-0329. (SP-1620) Development of a new high- performance Nissan V8 engine. Toshiyuki Okuzumi, Koichi Amari, Seiji Ishihara, Hisao Okawa, and Keiichi Murata, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes a new 4.5-Liter V8 engine, VK45DE, which was developed for the use in the Infiniti Q45 sporty luxury sedan. The VK45DE engine, the replacement of the VH41DE for the Infiniti Q45 2000 model, is a new generation V8 engine that pro- duces high output power at top-end speed and also generates ample torque at low and middle engine speed. Furthermore, this engine achieved best in class quietness that is pleasing the customer throughout the range of loads and speeds. Development efforts were focused on how to highly balance the need for performance with the need for quietness and smoothness. This paper provides details of this VK45DE engine as well as highlights of individual technologies that support highly balanced performance of this engine. 2001-01-0330.

The inline configuration provides an elegant solution to meeting customer demands with premium technology. Features include dual overhead cams - four valves per cylinder, variable exhaust valve timing, all aluminum construction for the cylinder block and cylinder head, and electronic throttle control. The engine is being produced at a com- pletely new manufacturing facility, the Flint Engine South Powertrain Plant in Flint, Michigan. This paper provides details of the product design and specifica- tions, an overview of the engineering processes used during devel- opment of the engine, as well as highlights of the manufacturing sys- tem and facility. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0332. Engine control using intake, combustion and transmission models. Yoshishige Ohyama, Hitachi Car Engineer- ing Co., Ltd. The combination of physical models of an advanced engine con- trol system was proposed to obtain sophisticated combustion control in ultra-lean combustion engines, including homogeneous compres- sion-ignition and activated radical combustion. Physical models of 47</page><page sequence="47">200 1 -0 1 -03 3 2-200 1-01-0337 intake, combustion (including engine thermodynamics), and trans- mission were incorporated, in which the effects of residual gas from prior cycles on intake air mass and combustion were taken into con- sideration. Control of the in-cylinder air/fuel ratio, exhaust tempera- ture and engine speed during start, post- start and gear shifting phases was investigated using simulations. 2001-01-0333. Development of a detailed friction model to predict mechanical losses at elevated maximum combustion pressures. D. A. Kouremenos, C. D. Rakopoulos , D. T. Hountalas, and T. K. Zannis, National Technical University of Athens. Engineers use phenomenological simulation models to determine engine performance. Using these models, we can predict with rea- sonable accuracy the heat release rate mechanism inside the engine cylinder, which enables us to obtain a prediction of the pressure his- tory inside the engine cylinder. Using this value and the volume change rate of the combustion chamber, we can then estimate the indicated power output of the engine. However, in order to obtain the brake engine power output we must have an indication for the mechanical losses, a great part of which are friction losses. Up to now various correlations have been proposed that provide the fric- tional mean effective pressure as a function mainly of engine speed and load. These correlations have been obtained from the processing of experimental data, i.e., experimental values for the indicated and brake power output of engines. Using these correlations we can get an acceptable prediction of the friction mean effective pressure and thus, estimate the engine brake power output from the correspond- ing indicated value. The process is especially important when ana- lyzing the performance of engines on the field where the brake power output cannot be measured directly or when developing new engines. A serious problem associated with the use of these correla- tions is that in the relevant expressions exist coefficients that are usually unknown. For this reason, these models have to be calibrated using known values, which is a disadvantage. Another problem is that these models predict in a very rough manner the effect of the maximum combustion pressure which nowadays has been increased considerably in production DI diesel engines; in some cases values around 170-180 bar have been reported. To overcome the previous problems and mainly to examine the effect of maximum combustion pressure on frictional losses, in the current work a detailed model for the estimation of all frictional forces from the moving elements of the engine is developed. Using the developed model, it is made possible to predict the history of the various forces during an engine operating cycle and mainly friction mean effective pressure and mechanical efficiency. The model has been applied on a modern die- sel engine with high maximum combustion pressures at three differ- ent engine-operating speeds and two different loads. As revealed, the model predicts with good accuracy the frictional losses at all engine operating conditions examined and the effect of the maxi- mum combustion pressure. The contribution of the last one is revealed not to be very significant at high values, despite initial expectations. 2001-01-0334. Feasibility of detailed vehicle modeling. Paul Bowles and Michael Tiller, Ford Motor Co. ; Hilding Elmqvist, Dag Brück, Sven Erik Mattsson, Andreas Möller, and Hans Olsson, Dynasim AB; and Martin Otter, German Aerospace Research Establishment. A feasibility study is presented concerning detailed vehicle mod- eling, including submodels for engine, transmission mechanics and hydraulics, as well as three-dimensional chassis behavior. The study was conducted jointly by Ford Motor Company, Dynasim AB and DLR. The results demonstrate that complex behavioral models of each subsystem can be developed, used and validated independently from each other, and finally assembled together to an overall model. Therefore, this approach could be the basis to establish modeling standards that allow collaboration between model developers throughout the automotive industry. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0335. Web-based vehicle performance simulations using Microsoft Excel. Dale A. Frank, University of Michigan- Dearborn ; and Shan Shih, ArvinMeritor Inc. Although computer models for vehicle and sub-system perfor- mance simulations have been developed and used extensively in the past several decades, there is currently a need to enhance the overall availability of these types of tools. Increasing demands on vehicle performance targets have intensified the need to obtain rapid feed- back on the effects of vehicle modifications throughout the entire development cycle. At the same time, evolution of the PC and development of Web- based applications have contributed to the availability, accessibility, and user-friendliness of sophisticated computer analysis. Web engineering is an ideal approach in supporting globalization and is a cost-effective design-analysis integration business strategy. There is little doubt that this new approach will have positive impacts on product cost, quality, and development cycle time. This paper will show how Microsoft Excel and the Web can be powerful and effective tools in the development process. To demon- strate the technique, a vehicle wide-open-throttle acceleration per- formance simulation example will be presented. Basic equations and assumptions will be reviewed, followed by a discussion on the consideration of several special conditions. Applicable programming techniques will be presented. An example of Web-based execution is provided. 2001-01-0336. Design and development of a model-based feedback controlled cooling system for heavy duty diesel truck applications using a vehicle engine cooling system simulation. Chad Lehner, General Motors Corp.; and Gordon Parker, Oner Arici, and John Johnson, Michigan Technical Univ. A thermal management system for heavy duty diesel engines is presented for maintaining acceptable and constant engine tempera- tures over a wide range of operational conditions. It consists of a computer controlled variable speed coolant pump, a position con- trolled thermostat, and a model-based control strategy. An experi- mentally validated, diesel engine cooling system simulation was used to demonstrate the thermal management system's capability to reduce power consumption. The controller was evaluated using a variety of operating scenarios across a wide range of loads, vehicle speeds, and ambient temperatures. Three metrics were used to assess the effects of the computer controlled system: engine temperature, energy savings, and cab temperature. The proposed control system provided very good control over the engine coolant temperatures while maintaining engine metal temperatures within a desired range. Less power is needed for the coolant pump which now provides lower and variable coolant flow rates based on engine operating conditions, and the fan power was also reduced in most cases. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0337. Six Sigma Program yields dramatic improve- ment through application of lean manufacturing methods in the printed circuit board industry. Marek L. Winiarz, GE Operation Services ; and James Fang and Howard Fuller, Solectron Corp. The GE Operations Services and Solectron Corporation Six Sigma Program improved printed circuit board (PCB) throughput, response time, and capacity through the use of Lean Manufacturing concepts and the application of Lean Manufacturing techniques. This paper illustrates how Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma com- plement each other for maximum benefit. The issues confronting the PCB industry include capacity and responsiveness to customer delivery demands. Rigorous Six Sigma Methods of Measurement and Analysis pointed towards Lean Man- ufacturing solutions. Lines were unbalanced, WIP clogged the flow and used valuable space, material flow interfered with operations, and non- value-added (NVA) time exceeded 95% in some cases. Graphical techniques and time studies pointed toward sensible flow, reduction of bottlenecks and proper allocation of space and human resources. 48</page><page sequence="48">2001-01-0337-2001-01-0345 The resulting improvement allowed for 142% capacity increase and 47% cycle time reduction.

Integrating impregnation, traditionally a batch process, into a lean manufacturing environment. Michael Potts , Ultraseal America Inc. The confrontation between the lean, clean, fast and compact demands of an advanced manufacturing environment and the tradi- tional parameters of impregnation are enormous. Impregnation is a sealing process, typically where hundreds of parts are manually packed into a process basket, and subsequently transferred between a series of large tanks, over a one- two hour cycle. Achieving the integration of impregnation into a lean manufac- turing environment addresses: batch sizes, process times, equipment foot print, plant layout and mobility, environmental waste and auto- mated component handling. Documented by case studies, a new generation of equipment and materials were developed. These advancements were the result of a systematic approach combining process, equipment and chemicals to enable a traditional batch pro- cess to be integrated onto the lean manufacturing shop floor. 2001-01-0340. Production decisions and lot sizing for auto- motive stamping. P. J. Campbell and M. J. Cardew-Hall , Austra- lian National Univ.; and P. D. Hodgson , Deakin Univ. A discrete event model was used to examine the effect of machine downtime and operating policy on the long-run average cost of an automotive stamping line. Operating policy refers to the selection of a target batch size and the circumstances under which a line stoppage will lead to the current batch being abandoned. It is assumed that the abandon/resume decision is based solely on the severity of the problem (i.e., repair cost) and the fraction of the batch completed. A method of identifying low-cost operating policies is presented using data obtained from a real stamping plant. It is found that, within a single part framework, this approach results in signifi- cantly lower average costs than are currently achieved. It is also demonstrated that by varying the model parameters it is possible to measure the potential benefits arising from process modifications (e.g., decreased die-set times). This can be used to identify the areas where improvements will have the greatest impact on cost and is particularly useful when assessing the expected return on a potential investment. A multiple-part extension to the model is suggested and the potential benefits discussed. 2001-01-0341. (SP- 1579) Environment-friendly fluxless sol- dering process for high sealing ability on pressure sensors. Takao Yoneyama, Hiroyuki Okada , Katsuhiro Izuchi, and Fumio Kojima, Denso Corp. In a conventional soldering process, solvents, such as chloro- fluorocarbons (CFCs), have been necessary to remove the flux- residue after soldering. A new CFC-free fluxless soldering process has been developed to obtain high sealing ability even in a small soldering area. This new process utilizes a reducing atmosphere with an appropriate load and assembly orientation to solder the parts. Under this fluxless con- dition, it is found that appropriate loading and good solder- wettability of the upper part increase the wettability of the lower part. 2001-01-0343. (SP- 1579) Wet versus dry turning: A compari- son of machining costs, product quality, and aerosol formation. Nathan King , Lucas Keranen, Kenneth Gunter , and John Suther- land , Michigan Technological Univ. The use of cutting fluid in machining operations not only poses a health risk to workers but also creates environmental challenges associated with fluid treatment and disposal. In an effort to mini- mize these concerns and eliminate the costs associated with cutting fluids, e.g., purchase, maintenance, and treatment, dry machining is increasingly being considered as an alternative. This paper is focused on comparing dry and wet machining approaches from sev- eral perspectives, including air quality, product quality, and eco- nomics. Both experimental and analytical work is presented. Experi- ments have been performed to determine the effect cutting fluid has on product quality and aerosol generation in the wet and dry turning of gray cast iron. To compare costs in wet and dry turning, a cost model, which includes cutting fluid-related components, has also been established. The model predictions and experimental observa- tions are compared/contrasted to other recent reports from the tech- nical literature. 2001-01-0344. (SP- 1603) GMBOND™ process: An environ- mentally friendly sand binder system. Scott R. Giese and Gerard Thiel , University of Northern Iowa Metal Casting Center; and Rich- ard M. Herried and Jeremy D. Eastman , Hormel Foods Corp. Automotive engineers are challenged with increasing fuel econ- omy in transportation vehicles by reducing weight. Aluminum cast- ings are replacing cast iron components as one way to reduce weight in cars. Many of the aluminum castings produced for automobiles today are made with a sand core to form the internal cavity of the automotive component. Currently, the most popular choice of sand binder system in core making is the phenolic urethane cold-box binder system. This system, however, was not designed for use at aluminum pouring temperatures. The collapsibility of a phenolic urethane cold-box core is not suf- ficient for expedient shakeout in an aluminum casting. Because of this, many aluminum castings must undergo secondary core removal processes. This reduced shakeout effectiveness limits the designer in the casting geometries available and adds cost to the part. The protein-based binder system was designed to replace current binder systems as an environmentally friendly sand binder and to improve the shakeout characteristics of the sand core. Detailed benefits of the protein-based binder process include excellent shakeout effectiveness, recyclability, and cost savings because of the reduced solid waste and labor expenditures. More applications for aluminum casting replacements will become avail- able as the awareness of this new process grows. Dissemination of the state of technology of the protein-based binder process to the automotive engineer would allow for more timely advancement of casting design and metal casting technology. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0345. (SP- 1603) Recovery of waste polystyrene gen- erated by lost foam technology in the automotive industry. Jeremy Pletka and Jarosław Drelich , Michigan Technological Univ. In the automotive industry, lost foam casting is a relatively new technology, which is gaining popularity among manufacturers. Lost foam casting is a process in which an expanded polystyrene pattern is formed into the shape of the part to be cast. More complex parts are fabricated by simply gluing several simple patterns together. The pattern is then coated with a refractory material consisting of a min- eral mixture and binders. Finally, hot metal is poured into the pat- tern, evaporating the expanded polystyrene and taking shape of the coating shell. However, the automotive industry has observed that a significant number of these fabricated, coated patterns are dam- aged, or do not meet specifications prior to casting. These are not reusable and inevitably are landfilled. It is the goal of this project to develop a simple, reliable, and inexpensive technology to recover expanded polystyrene from the glue and coating constituents. This study includes an investigation of the size distributions of each com- ponent (polystyrene, coating, and glue) upon shredding, air separa- tion/classification, and the effectiveness of impact milling. Separa- tion testing has recovered as high as 96% of the polystyrene, while the level of contaminants did not exceed 5 wt% in the final product. These results indicate that a promising technological approach has been selected and that realization of a separation technology is feasible. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 49</page><page sequence="49">2001-01-0347-2001-01-0354 2001-01-0347.

The as-sintered and the sintered and tempered transverse rupture and tensile properties of seven recently developed high performance PM compositions are reviewed. Two are improved versions of the well-known diffusion-alloyed grades according to MPIF Standard 35. Two others are likewise improved versions of more highly alloyed analogs of the latter that have only recently been introduced. The remaining three are all new compositions that take advantage of the powerful alloying effects of silicon. The silicon is added by a proprietary method that greatly reduces its susceptibility to oxida- tion during sintering, an effect that has heretofore limited its use. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0348. (SP- 1610) Nondestructive measures of struc- tural integrity in powder metal parts using resonance - Case study. Patrick M. Bowen , Quasar International , Inc. Nondestructive test methods have focused on specific and nar- row properties of critical dimension, hardness, visual indications, or localized crack detection, while missing significant structural char- acteristics not apparent without destructive test. Multi-frequency resonant inspection is a new technology, which accomplishes a quantitative, whole-body, structural analysis using natural mechanical resonances of a powder metal part. The technol- ogy is applicable to a wide range of product size and geometries, and has been used successfully on powder metal connecting rods, timing gears, ABS rings, exhaust flanges, gerotors, and more. This paper describes measurement and application fundamentals in context of a connecting rod study on production parts. Data is presented which demonstrate the ability to detect structural defects in sintered powder metal parts. 2001-01-0349. (SP-1610) Metal injection-molded components in automotive applications. Brian P. Hetzel and Peter A. dePoutil- off, SSI-Sintered Specialties. Metal Injection Molding (MIM) has become an established pro- cess over the past 20 years for producing small complex metal parts. A variety of industries have benefited from the capabilities of the MIM process. Some examples include orthodontic brackets, medi- cal instruments, firearm components, lock mechanisms, and elec- tronic data storage devices. More recently (over the past 5 years) the MIM process has found applications in the automotive industry in a variety of systems including steering columns, seat mechanisms, sunroof systems, ignition locks, airbags, and engines. This paper discusses some of the benefits that the MIM process has brought to these automotive applications. 2001-01-0350. (SP-1610) Creating innovation in torque trans- fer systems through optimization of powder metallurgy compo- nents. Timothy R. Weilbaker , BorgWarner Automotive Powdered Metals Corp.; and Earl R. Lumpkins, Jr., Hoeganaes Corp. This paper will describe the BorgWarner Interactive Torque Management (ITM) system for FWD-based AWD systems as well as the utilization of P/M technology for critical components within this system. The ITM is an electro-mechanical coupling device. The device consists of an electromagnet, ball ramp and wet clutch sys- tem. The system can be mounted anywhere in the drive line as well as integrated into components such as transfer cases and transaxles. The clutch actuation force is dependent on the current applied to the electromagnetic coil, providing a truly variable torque transfer device. The decision to make extensive use of P/M technology in the structural portion of this system was based on the net shape capa- bility and weight reduction combined with the ability to chose from a wide range of engineered materials that resulted in the most eco- nomical total system package. 2001-01-0351. (SP-1610) Machinability and performance of precision powder-forged connecting rods. Timothy Geiman, Denis Christopherson, Michael Marra , and Raymond Williams, GKN Sinter Metals. Connecting rods manufactured by the Precision Powder-Forged (P/F) process offer several distinct advantages over those produced by all other methods including the state-of-the-art forged steel pro- cess. Precision P/F connecting rods have mechanical properties equivalent to those made from forged steel, with the added benefits of greater design flexibility, superior dimensional and weight preci- sion, simplified finish machining and assembly, better machinabil- ity, and increased consistency because of highly stable metallurgy and a robust and reliable manufacturing process. The inherent flexi- bility of the P/F process also facilitates tailoring materials to achieve the optimal balance of strength and machinability for a given appli- cation. In combination, these advantages result in a product that requires less capital investment for finish machining, is more envi- ronmentally conscious by generating substantially less waste, exhib- its better total performance, and has lower total cost. This paper describes the key advantages of Precision P/F connecting rods with a focus on precision, machinability and mechanical property optimization. 2001-01-0352. A finite element material model and method for predicting the cumulative behavior of energy absorbing components in thermoplastic bumper systems subjected to mul- tiple impacts. Frank J. Ferfecki, GE Plastics. The paper describes a finite element procedure and material model that can be used to predict the post-impact geometry of a ther- moplastic bumper energy absorber. The material used in the study is a thermoplastic PC/PBT blend. The methodology presented deter- mines the final geometric shape based on a new finite element mate- rial model. The material model uses a secant return modulus that is a function of the plastic strain. The conversion of material data into a finite element material model, along with a finite element proce- dure for analyzing multiple impacts, is discussed. Comparisons of finite element predictions to test data are also presented. 2001-01-0353. An approach to front-end system design for pedestrian safety. Pádraig Naughton and Peter Cate, Dow Auto- motive?. An approach to a solution to conflicts of interest posed by new pedestrian safety requirements is presented here. The effects of vari- ous design parameters on pedestrian safety, and the resulting influ- ence on other requirements are examined. Limitations and possible solution envelopes are determined with regard to styling, packaging and functionality. Material choice and the stiffness of the structure are used as variables to fine-tune the system. The paper explores the effects of using current front-end materials and new material options versus what can be achieved by modifying or developing designs and structures to fulfill the set of conflicting requirements. Com- puter Aided Engineering (CAE) techniques are used extensively for this work, in order to determine the sensitivity of the behavior of front-end systems to design and material characteristics. Finally an overall approach to solutions is presented, involving a theory of stiffness distribution to meet the pedestrian safety requirements, while continuing to address the current needs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0354.

(SP- 1591) Evaluation method for verbal inter- face while driving from the viewpoint of safety. Shin-ichi Kojima, Yuji Uchiyama, Hiroyuki Hoshino, and Takero Hongo , Toyota Cen- tral R&amp;D Labs., Inc. This study proposes an evaluation method for a verbal interface while driving. In this method, the reaction time is measured and the rate of the delayed reaction time trial is used as an index. We have designed a new reaction time test procedure that contains stimulus, perception, attention, choice and response. Based on results of an actual vehicle experiment, we indicate that our method has better examination capability than using the average reaction time as an index and that we can find the time that tends to delay the reaction during a verbal task by processing the delayed reaction time trial. 2001-01-0357. (SP- 1591) Research on a brake assist system with a preview function. Minoru Tamura, Hideaki Inoue, Takayuki Watanabe, and Naoki Maruko, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Traffic accidents in Japan claim some 10,000 precious lives every year, and there is seemingly no end to the problem. In an effort to overcome this situation, vehicle manufacturers have been pushing ahead with the development of a variety of advanced safety technol- ogies. Joint public-private sector projects related to Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are also proceeding vigorously. Most accidents can be attributed to driver error in recognition, judgment or vehicle operation. This paper presents an analysis of driver behavior characteristics in emergency situations that lead to an accident, focusing in particular on operation of the brake pedal. Based on the insights gained so far, we have developed a Brake Assist System with a Preview Function (BAP) designed to prevent accidents by helping drivers with braking actions. Experimental results have confirmed that BAP is effective in reducing the impact speed and the frequency of accidents in emer- gency situations. 2001-01-0358.

This paper describes the cluster analysis technique and how it can be used to support menu interface design for in-vehicle multi- media applications. Cluster analysis and similar types of classifying techniques have proven effective for developing simple menu inter- faces. This paper extends the use of the cluster analysis technique to a more complex system that consists of 201 generic functions. These functions are representative of those being incorporated into near-term multimedia products. Study results show promise for using cluster analysis as a tool for incorporating the user's organiza- tional structure into the design of a complex menu architecture. Cluster analysis may also benefit the automotive menu designer by providing a means for partitioning menu tasks into chunkable units that can be easily accessed by the driver in single glances. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0360. Innovative thermoplastic polyolefin paint pro- cess. Sawako Kamei, Kazuo Igarashi, and Michael Wiseman, Honda R&amp;D Americas, Inc. The desire to increase production and reduce cost while increas- ing environmental consciousness, is a constant challenge in the ther- moplastic olefin (TPO) paint industry. Typically, TPO substrates are painted with an adhesion promoter for durability, and top coats for appearance. Although the adhesion promoter has an important func- tion, the intrinsic value is not significant compared to top coats. A process and material was developed to eliminate conventional adhe- sion promoter spray application. By incorporating a novel adhesion promoter into the aqueous pretreatment system, many of the stresses of high production volumes, and operating costs were addressed while improving environmental awareness. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0361. Development of recycling technology for water-borne paint - Development/practical use of recyclable paint for parts. Seiji Yokoi, Takeshi Bessho, and Tadayuki Sakai, Toyota Motor Corp. The transfer efficiency for painting processes utilizing water- borne materials is low, and the residual paint is disposed of as waste. In this study, we focused on a recycling system to collect and dis- solve the paint over- spray in the booth water, and to concentrate and regenerate it by means of an ultra filter (UF). Paint adaptable to the recycling system has been developed by providing compatibility between the high hydrophilicity of liquid paint and the high hydro- phobicity of the paint film, in order to ensure the recyclability and the high anti-corrosion performance required of paint on automobile underbody parts.

The Auto/Steel Partnership established the Light Truck Frame Project Group in 1996 with two objectives: (a) to develop materials, design and fabrication knowledge that would enable the frames on North American OEM (original equipment manufacturer) light trucks to be reduced in weight, and (b) to improve corrosion resis- tance of frames on these vehicles, thereby allowing a reduction in the thickness of the components and a reduction in frame weight. To address the issues relating to corrosion, a subgroup of the Light Truck Frame Project Group was formed. The group comprised rep- resentatives from the North American automotive companies, test laboratories, frame manufacturers, and steel producers. As part of a comprehensive test program, the Corrosion Subgroup has com- pleted tests on frame coatings. Using coated panels of a low carbon hot rolled and pickled steel sheet and two types of accelerated cyclic corrosion tests, seven frame coatings were tested for corrosion per- formance. The coatings included those that are currently in use for frames, such as the hot-melt waxes and E-coat, as well as those for potential future applications. One type of cyclic test was a proving ground corrosion trailer test (100 cycles) carried out on a test track at the General Motors Proving Ground test facility. The second type of cyclic test was based on the SAE J2334 laboratory corrosion test (80 cycles), modified to include a bake step at an elevated tempera- 51</page><page sequence="51">200 1 -0 1 -0363-200 1 -0 1 -037 1 ture (93°C, 121°C or 149°C) and an exposure to shot blast in the cycle. The modifications were designed to simulate corrosion under conditions of exposure of the coating to elevated temperatures from the automotive exhaust system and the damage to the coating by the road gravel impact. Both tests revealed differences in the perfor- mance of the frame coatings. Details of the test cycles, procedures for the evaluation of corrosion and the reasons for the performance differences are presented in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0364. Surface properties and utilisation of pre- coated and pre-painted steel: Existing products and new devel- opments. Cécile De Medeiros , Usinor. Usinor has developed organic and inorganic films, for many automotive applications. The surface post-treatments made by the coil-coater provide additional functions to the metallic coated steel, such as lubrication or corrosion protection, and offer an excellent compromise between car manufacturing, steel utilisation and costs saving. Even though the organic coating thickness can reach 8 jam, steel products can be welded and electro-painted, thanks to metallic pigments within the coating, which make the polymer conductive. In some particular cases, where high flexibility and formability are required, the best solution is organic non-pigmented systems with lower thickness from 1 to 2 pm. Other pre-painted steel systems with thicker organic coatings have the potential to replace ED-paint or to remove Primer-Surfacer on paint lines by the car manufacturer. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0365. (SP- 1620) Performance comparison between chain and belt cam-drive systems. Kyoyul Oh, Matthew Plauman, Jerry Romanick , and Ian Farmer, Gates Rubber Co.; and Michael Aimone, and David Barnaby, Ford Motor Co. Cam-drive system performance was experimentally evaluated between chain and belt drive systems. The production Ford Duratec 3. 0L 4- val ve engine that is chain drive system was used as a refer- ence and it was retrofitted with the belt drive system. The perfor- mance differences between the two systems were compared by observing the cam-drive system NVH, difference in power-loss and drive efficiency. The experimental study showed significant advantage of the belt cam-drive system in the NVH measurement, and this showed an average of 2-3 dBA improvement in the overall sound pressure level. There were more significant NVH improvements when observing the sound pressure level in the meshing order when com- paring the belt cam-drive system to the chain drive system. Addi- tionally, the comparison between the chain and belt cam-drive sys- tems revealed a drive torque efficiency improvement of 1% to 1.25% in the average for the belt cam-drive system. 2001-01-0366.

(SP- 1620) Mechanical performance of v-ribbed belt drives (theoretical modeling). S. M. Tabatabaei and G. H. Payganeh, University of Shahid Rajaee; and T. H. C. Childs, University of Leeds. A v-ribbed belt is assumed to be a combination of a flat belt and a v-belt with the same radial movement of the two parts. Based on these assumptions a new theory is developed for the mechanical per- formance of v-ribbed belt drives, which gives a new modification to Euler' s equation (capstan formula). The experimental and theo- retical results comparison show that the radial movement of the v-ribbed belt with rib bottom/groove tip contact is slightly less than the values without contact. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0368.

The purpose of this study is to find the suitable working condi- tions of a Pressure Wave Supercharger (PWS) that is coupled to a gasoline engine experimentally. The working condition is validated by stationary measurements on an engine dynamometer. To achieve an easier system structure, it was examined to use the engine output for driving of PWS. As a result, it was confirmed that the engine coupled with PWS could be driven by making the ratio of the PWS rotor speed and the engine speed constant. 2001-01-0369. (SP- 1620) Approximation of IC engine valve acceleration from proximity probe displacement data. Brian Johnson, Daryl Retzke, Derek Dewitt, Robert L. Norton, and John R. Hall, Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This study utilizes an eddy current proximity probe to approxi- mate the acceleration of a valve in a SOHC valve train. Several tech- niques are discussed for extrapolating acceleration data from dis- placement data through numerical differentiation. The data were compared to acceleration data as measured by an accelerometer mounted on the valve face. It was found that valve train acceleration behavior can be reasonably approximated using displacement data as measured by a proximity probe when differentiated using a three- point Lagrangian interpolation. But the frequency response of the proximity probe is severely restricted by the limitations of the mea- surement and data collection instrumentation, the limitations of the differentiation method and the continuity of the base measured data. 2001-01-0370. Discriminating tests for automotive engine air filters. T. J. Ptak, Puenpit Richberg, and Thierry Vasseur, Purolator Products Inc. Test standards for evaluating filters should provide uniform methods for the quantitative performance evaluation. Currently, automotive air induction filters are tested according to the SAE J726 standard. This standard recommends measurement of the gravimet- ric initial and final efficiencies. Measurement of gravimetric effi- ciencies provides limited information on filter behavior, since the information about the size of particles penetrating the filter is not included. In addition, the measurement of the initial gravimetric efficiency does not provide sufficient information on the initial stage of filtration. Determination of the efficiency at the initial stage of filtration is critical, since at this stage filters show their lowest effi- ciency, which can have an adverse effect on engine wear. To overcome this problem and to obtain more knowledge on the initial stage of filtration, the initial gravimetric efficiency was mea- sured at different levels of dust loading. The initial gravimetric effi- ciency measured at the dust loading of 5 grams was in the range of 90%, well below the recommended value of 99%. Additional infor- mation about this stage of filtration and the size of particles penetrat- ing filters was obtained from the fractional efficiency measure- ments. Current filters remove approximately 40% of particles larger than 1 micron and 80% of particles larger than 2.5 microns. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0371. Development of a new air cleaner filter. Kouichi Oda and Minoru Honda, Toyoda Boshoku Corp. A recent trend in the auto industry has been an increasing focus on the environment, which demands that product designs be "eco- friendly". For this it is important to design products that can be eas- ily disassembled of formed of combustible materials. Accordingly, forming parts using a single kind of recyclable material is the most effective way to satisfy the above-described requirement. We there- fore took this approach with the development of an air cleaner filter. 52</page><page sequence="52">200 1 -0 1 -037 1 -200 1 -0 1 -0379 While a conventional air cleaner filter for an engine is generally composed of three parts, that is, filter medium, sealing material, and frame, we developed a recyclable air cleaner filter formed only of the filter medium. To do so, however, it was critical that both seala- bility and durability of the filter medium be maintained. In order to achieve this, a thermoplastic non-woven fabric was used to produce the filter. We constructed a flange to be durable by compressing the outer periphery of the filter to a high density, and succeeded in obtaining sufficient sealability by compressing the outermost peripheral portion of the flange to a low density. This makes it possi- ble not only to produce the filter medium using only the thermoplas- tic non- woven fabric, but also to reduce its weight compared with the conventional filter. The newly developed filter is thus called the "Full Fabric Air Filter". 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0372. Advances in automatic transmission cleanli- ness. John G. Eleftherakis and Abrahim Khalil, Fluid Technologies, Inc.; and Doug Parnell, Bill Pizzo, and Dan Haggard, SPX Filtran. This paper presents the rationale and underlying logic for auto- matic transmission filtration contaminant control (ATFCC). This approach relies upon an integrated filtration system as opposed to simply sandwiching in a piece of filter media or metal screen in the traditional transmission oil sump area. Most significantly, quantita- tive filtration system design and specification will result from imple- mentation of a thorough ATFCC approach. A new transmission filter test procedure is also presented which closely represents the field operation of these types of filters. Test results are presented which compare the new test procedures results' with more traditional Multipass Filter test results. 2001-01-0374. Quality - The next step is getting to the level of behavior. Jim Spigener, Behavioral Science Technology, Inc.

FMERA - Failure modes, effects, and (finan- cial) risk analysis. Carl D. Tarum, Delphi Automotive Systems. Continuous Improvement activities are often based on a list of top concerns, such as highest RPN (Risk Priority Number) on the PFMEA (Process Failure Modes and Effects Analysis), warranty items, or scrap rates. But a company is in business to make a profit for its stockholders. Therefore, money should be considered, rather than just technical engineering tools and RPNs. Current PFMEA methodology focuses on delivering quality parts to the customer. The financial impact of various potential pro- cess problems is not considered directly. A new and extended tech- nique called FMERA (pronounced Fuh-MAIR-uh) can identify and prioritize the process part of potential problems that have the most financial impact on an operation. Alternatives can be evaluated to maximize the financial benefits. FMERA is a method for getting the voice of the stockholder into process decisions. This methodology should not be used to justify risk when there are issues such as human safety, product safety, company policy, or regulatory concerns. These types of issues should be addressed using other guidelines, such as design specifications and product testing. FMERA is useful for comparing and selecting process alter- natives that reduce the potential financial cost of a particular process alternative. 2001-01-0376. Mechanical verification of customer interfaces in automotive component manufacturing. Paul Novak, Robert Irwin, and Jim Glusic, Delphi Delco Electronics Systems. The best efforts to create a highly engineered, technologically advanced, and elegant automotive component will be lost if the component does not physically fit into the customer's vehicle at the assembly plant. One of the principles of mechanical verification (also called poka-yoke or error proofing) is that every part is verified every time. Mechanical verification is not based on statistical sam- pling, and it is not the same thing as, nor is it designed to reintro- duce, incoming inspection. In this paper we will discuss some of the methods used at Delphi Delco Electronics to mechanically verify customer interfaces without adding labor or processes to the produc- tion line. Most of the methods used are very "low tech," and they are based on common sense. We will also go beyond the verification methods used and discuss the process we used to implement a mechanical verification system. One of the key points to successful implementation was starting very early in the product development cycle. Another key was involvement of people from many different backgrounds, including our customers and suppliers. A detailed description of a mechanical verification matrix is included in the paper. This matrix is the main tool and scorecard used during the development of our mechanical verification system. 2001-01-0377. A heuristic method for product reliability esti- mation. Wenwei Song, Joan Partridge, and Alex Greene, TRW Automotive. Traditionally, reliability of a product is estimated or predicted using known constant failure rates of components or assumed proba- bility distributions. There can be significant differences between predictions and actual product performance. In this paper, an alter- native reliability prediction approach is developed. The reliability of a system is estimated with upper and lower boundaries. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0378. The end of quality control. Andrew J. Varga, TriniTech Group, LLC. Quality is taken as the suitability of purposeful activity to the needs and expectations of customers. Identifying, quantifying and controlling the characteristics by which customers judge suitability of output is the essence of controlling quality and customer satisfac- tion. Manufacturing companies are large entities requiring intricate systems to coordinate internal activities. Many systems have been developed to document procedures, collect performance data and facilitate communications. Each system, good in itself, may focus too narrowly on specific activities. Comprehensive systems pro- moted by the CEO are required for a company to function as one. This paper describes the integration of existing quality disci- plines into one, coherent plan that directs company activity toward customer satisfaction. This is the end of quality control. 2001-01-0379. Tangential computed tomography for indus- trial inspection. Nand K. Gupta and Bruce Isaacson, Omega Inter- national Technology, Inc. Industrial computed tomography has developed from a medical technology base. As such industrial systems reflect medical require- ments which are not necessarily efficient for industrial applications. The Tangential CT scanner is truly a volume scanner system designed for industrial inspection. The part motions required for CT data collection are efficient and fit well with part handling motions normally used by industrial inspection equipment. The part enters the system, moves through the scanning station and exits with a sin- gle linear motion. The detectors are designed for industrial applica- tions to maximize sensitivity while minimizing electronic and x-ray scatter noise. The system can be easily programmed for different size parts with different resolution requirements. The result is a data set that is acquired efficiently and has the required volumetric data for Flaw detection, Metrology or Reverse Engineering. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 53</page><page sequence="53">200 1 -0 1 -03 8 1 -200 1 -0 1 -03 88 2001-01-0381. (SP- 1591) A study of drivers' fatigue mecha- nisms during long hour driving. Nanae Michida, Hiroshi Oki- yama, Kazuo Nishikawa, and Takahide Nouzawa , Mazda Motor Corp . Drivers' fatigue during long hour driving comes from various causes. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanisms of drivers' fatigue in relation to seat performance. The drivers' posture was examined on the assumption that an optimal seating posture against fatigue should exist. As a first step, laboratory test was con- ducted to grasp fatigue analysis viewpoints. Then, as a next step, road test with seat pressure distribution (S.P.D.) and Electromyo- gram (EMG) was implemented to clarify fatigue process. Results show that seat support condition is found to be one of the factors behind uncomfortable postures and physical burdens, which leads to subjectively felt fatigues. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0382. (SP- 1591) Variables influencing shoulder belt positioning of four-point safety belts. Tiffani Natalini and Kirsten Carr, Ford Motor Co.; and Marilyn Vala and William Boroughf Lear Corp. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal location of the shoulder belts for a suspender style four-point safety belt sys- tem. This optimal location must satisfy two conditions. First, the shoulder belts must properly fit over the occupant's shoulders for safety performance. Second, the shoulder belts location on the occu- pant's body must be acceptable to the occupant. To determine the optimal acceptable location of the shoulder belts, forty-four subjects were recruited by height and tested in a reconfigurable test seat. The results showed that avoiding an interac- tion between the shoulder belts and the occupant's neck improved the acceptability of the system. Variables that affected this interac- tion included the horizontal and vertical position of the shoulder belts and the occupant's weight, clothing, and gender. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0383. (SP- 1591) The Soft &amp; Firm Seat: How innova- tion in automotive seating can improve the user's well being. Gérald Millet and Denis Pignè de, Faurecia. Comfort is more than ever one of the major factors of car perfor- mance. The seat, a central component of the vehicle interior, con- tributes heavily to this perception. The increasing partnership between car manufacturers and automotive system equipment man- ufacturers pushes Faurecia to propose not only standard components but also a complete seat, with its functional and safety criteria, as well as those including comfort. This last aspect is what we will treat here. We are going to show you how the Soft &amp; Firm Seat, a technical innovation developed by Faurecia, improves seat tactile and contact comfort behavior perceived by customers. This innovation has been designed according to Faurecia comfort methodology, using subjec- tive assessment, objective measurements and simulation. Its valida- tion concerns tactile and contact comfort, interactions with other comfort aspects and consequently the improvement of overall comfort. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0384. (SP- 1591) Dynamic ride quality investigation and DB of ride values for passenger and RV cars. Taehyung Kim , Younggun Cho, and Yong-San Yoon, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ; and Sejin Park , Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science. The ride values of seven cars (six passenger car and one RV car) are evaluated for 4 subjects based on the vibration of the bodies. And the seat qualities are investigated with the SEAT (seat effective amplitude transmissibility) value. The evaluated values are arranged as DB in html files. Since one of the most important parameters for ride comfort is the level and duration of the root mean square accel- eration experienced, the acceleration responses of subjects are mea- sured at 8 points on their bodies (3 Translational axes on the seat surface, 3 translational axes at the feet and 2 axes (x,z) at the back- rest) when the subjects are excited by driving a vehicle on the road. The ride values such as the overall ride value, the component ride values and the seat effective amplitude transmissibility based on acceleration root mean square are evaluated for different seven vehi- cles using frequency weighting functions and axis multiplying fac- tors. The posture of the subject is important for measuring the human vibration. The change in posture may alter the human response. So the ride values according to the variation of seating posture (the angle of backrest) are evaluated. The ride quality according to the driving velocity are also studied. 2001-01-0386. (SP- 1591) Heavy vehicle ride and driver com- fort. Rayya Hassan and Kerry McManus , Swinburne University of Technology. The ride environment of the heavy vehicle driver is the product of the applied excitation and the response properties of the vehicle. Road surface roughness is considered as a major source of excita- tion. However, road sections with similar roughness values may have different roughness characteristics and ride qualities. This study showed that the perceived ride quality of truck drivers is influ- enced by the roughness content in the waveband 4.8- 19.5m. Accord- ingly, a new roughness index was developed that gives good predic- tions of the perceived truck ride and correlates well with the levels of whole body vibrations transmitted through the driver's seat while traversing the test sections. 2001-01-0387. (SP- 1591) Objective evaluation of seat lateral support for cornering. Hiroshi Okiyama, Nanae Michida , Kazuo Nishikawa , and Takahide Nouzawa , Mazda Motor Corp. For an automobile seat, lateral support is considered to be one of the most essential elements for comfort. This report examines lat- eral support with two selected seats. Driver's movement while cor- nering was observed by seat pressure distribution (S.P.D.), and mus- cle activity was simultaneously recorded in electromyogram (EMG). S.P.D. showed larger lateral movement of driver and EMG showed higher muscle activity on a poor lateral support seat than on a good lateral support seat. The higher muscle activity on the poor seat was explained as an effort to compete against the larger lateral movement of the body. Thus, poor lateral support was proved to lead to heavier physical burden. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0388. (SP- 1591) Development of the evaluating sys- tem for ride comfort and fatigue in vehicle. Se Jin Park and Byung-Chan Min , Korea Research Institute of Standards and Sci- ence; and Jong-Kwang Lee and E-Sok Kang, Chung-Nam National Univ. The ride comfort in road vehicles and the drivers' fatigue are dependent on a complex combination of variables, including the vibration. In many studies, ride comfort and driving fatigue are stud- ied as an independent research area respectively. A subjective mea- sures, as a general method, are used in evaluating them. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the factors affecting drivers' ride com- fort and fatigue in a scientific and systematic manner in order to pro- vide the drivers with more safely operated automobiles and to pre- vent the traffic accidents due to fatigue. An evaluating system for ride quality and fatigue in vehicle is constructed. This system con- sists of a 12 axis vibration measurement module, an electromyogra- phy (EMG) measurement module and an ultrasonic 3D motion ana- lyzer. In this study, we investigated the overall ride value of seven types of vehicle so as to choose the two vehicles which have a good or bad ride quality. Then using these two vehicles, we investigated the influences for the degree of ride quality on fatigue. Experimental results about both the ride quality based on the root mean square acceleration and fatigue based on the EMG signal and the motion of driver are provided to show the effectiveness of the constructed system. 54</page><page sequence="54">2001-01-0389-2001-01-0397 2001-01-0389. (SP- 1591) Continuous passive lumbar spinal motion: The BackCycler® system for preventing low back dis- comfort, stiffness and fatigue during sitti. Rowland G. Hazard ', University of Vermont &amp; Ergomedics, Inc. Low back pain is the most common physical complaint of motor vehicle drivers and passengers. Various seat back contours have been developed to improve low back comfort, and lumbar support has some advantages. Recently, a series of experiments have dem- onstrated that a continuously inflating and deflating (BackCycler®) lumbar support bladder system can reduce low back discomfort, stiffness and fatigue in drivers with and without clinical back prob- lems. As demonstrated by radiographic movies, this system works by gently keeping the user's lumbar spine moving through greater and lesser forward curves (lordosis). The purpose of this paper is to present the efficacy research and to review the proposed mecha- nisms of action for this emerging seating comfort technology. 2001-01-0390. (SP- 1591) A vehicle seat suspension with hybrid control system. A. M. A. Soliman, Minia Univ. Although active suspensions are well known to provide improved performance over passive systems, their two main draw- backs are the required energy input levels and the high component costs. A hybrid control system is proposed which addresses these two drawbacks. Its performance is examined theoretically in a sim- ple application in which it is used as a seat suspension coupled to a quarter car model representing the general properties of vehicle ride dynamics. The hardware for the hybrid control system is based on DC motors and a condenser, and the strategy is to store the dissi- pative energy obtained in the dissipative cycles for later use in the active cycles when input power is required. Practical issues are transferring the rotary motor motion to linear motion and electric components of the energy regenerative damper. These are chosen to give a practical damping coefficient value and to control the seat actuator. The performance of the hybrid control system is compared with passive and semi-active systems. The hybrid control system per- forms better compared with passive and semi-active suspension sys- tem. Although several implementation issues remain with the pro- posed hardware, the work has demonstrated the potential benefits of this system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0392.

Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT) values can be obtained from direct measurements at seat track and top or estimated from transmissibility data and seat track input. Vertical transmissi- bility was measured for sixteen seats and six subjects on the Ford Vehicle Vibration Simulator, and these 96 functions used to esti- mate the seat top response for rough road input. SEAT values were calculated, and good correlation to values computed from direct seat top measurements obtained (R2 of 0.86). Averaging transmis sibili- ties and direct seat measurements over the 6 subjects to obtain corre- lations for the 16 seats improved R2 to 0.94, validating this approach. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0393. (SP- 1591) ERL, a CAD-based model of human occupants. Herbert M. Reynolds and Raymond R. Brodeur, ERL. LLC; and Sam Aljundi, General Motors Corp. A new CAD-based model of the occupant/driver for interior and seat design has been developed. Unlike traditional automotive itera- tive design methods that begin with a 2D human manikin in an envi- ronment based on the location of H-point, the 3D ERL manikins determine the initial design positions of multiple occupants based on the simulated interactions of seat, driver package, skeletal link- age system and deflected human tissue. The 3D ERL human body representations come from measurements of posture-critical skeletal landmarks on 102 test subjects combined with measurements of "de- flected human tissue" data from 60 test subjects. The result is a set of three dimensional, posture-biofidelic manikins that a computer algorithm optimizes the driver's workplace environment to fit the population range of sizes and postural preferences. In summary, this design optimization creates interior specifications for the seat, steer- ing wheel, pedals, and IP in their 3D location for the population of drivers that operate the vehicle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0395.

(SP-1610) Machinability of sintered distaloy HP-1 components. Chin Chang, Graham Smith, and Guy Littlefair, Southampton Institute. Powder metallurgy (P/M) industry has been known for the capa- bility of producing near-net- shape parts. Its specific characteristics have resulted in lower production costs and eliminating many sec- ondary machining. However, more and more P/M parts do require additional operations to fulfil their complex geometry features and surface roughness. Many of the machining factors that influence the machinability of cast and wrought steel parts, such as cutting speed, feedrate, cool- ant, tool geometry and shape, are also considered in the machining of P/M parts. However, composition, structure, and porosity of P/M are additional factors to be considered. Porosity in the P/M structure can decrease the machinability and shorten the tool life. Different variables have been considered in the material composition. Mate- rial densities and the free-machining additive manganese sulphide (MnS) are the two main factors of material composition, which dominate the machining performance. This paper will demonstrate the essential considerations of cut- ting parameters and the microstructure of P/M components. Turning operations have been tested to show the relationship between the cutting forces and surface finish. This study shows that the manga- nese sulphide powder can improve the machinability of these alloys under different machining conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 55</page><page sequence="55">200 1 -0 1 -0398-200 1 -0 1 -0403 2001-01-0398.

Moreover, tool manufacturers have often neglected the P/M industry to a point that it is still very difficult to find guide- lines regarding tool selection, surface speed and feed rate required for performing various machining operations. Even though quantita- tive data derived from "drilling tests" are increasingly available, their interpretation cannot readily be applied to other machining pro- cesses or types of powder.

This study compares the green and ejection characteristics of binder-treated FC-0205 mixes containing either a new high green strength lubricating system or conventional EBS wax. The compari- son was carried out on TRS specimens and gears pressed from 6.8 to 7.2 g/cm3 on laboratory and production scale presses. The influ- ence of these lubricating systems on green machining was also determined on gear shape specimens pressed to 6.8 and 7.0 g/cm3. Results showed that mixes containing the new lubricating system exhibit similar compressibility and a better lubrication behavior than mixes admixed with the conventional EBS wax. Moreover, the green strength of gears produced with the new lubricating system was sufficiently high to enable machining in the green state. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0400. (SP- 1610) New structures of brush and brush- less DC motors using soft magnetic composites for automotive applications. P. Viarouge, J. Cros, and Y. Chalifour, Selem Electro- technologies Inc.; and C. Gélinas, Quebec Metal Powders Limited. The original brush and brushless DC motor structures presented in this paper make use of a special winding technique which pres- ents several advantages: the copper volume of the motor is mini- mized, the mechanical structure is well adapted to the pressing pro- cess because the armature is designed with a small number of rela- tively wide slots and the winding process is easier. The isotropic properties of soft magnetic composites are also used to design a magnetic circuit where the magnetic flux is circulating in three dimensions. It is then possible to maximize the torque-to-weight ratio and to minimize the total axial length of the motor. This paper describes an efficient use of a new technology of magnetic material that needs a new structural design approach taking into account the advantages and constraints of the material, and that the direct replacement approach is usually not optimal. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0401. (SP-1610) Powder metal bearings and gears with steel-like performance. D. Sarafinchan, P. Jones, K. Buckley- Golder, and H. David, Stackpole Limited. Advanced powder metal technology is capable of producing car- burized, low alloy steel bearings and gears that deliver mechanical performance comparable to conventional steel. This quantum leap in PM technology has been accomplished by applying cold work densification to surfaces that require enhanced durability in the application. Using various test methods, core and surface properties are com- pared for the PM and conventional steel materials; namely tensile, impact toughness, bending fatigue, and contact fatigue. A back-to- back durability test for automotive manual transmission gears has been used to compare PM gears with conventional steel gears. Test data show that PM gear teeth can endure equivalent contact stress and, by employing design benefits which are exclusive to PM tool- ing related gear tooth manufacture, similar tooth loading as conven- tional gears. PM manufacturing can achieve AGMA 10 gear quality. Along with the economic design benefits of PM gears, the design limita- tions, namely component size and tooth geometry, are reviewed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0402. (SP-1610) Permanent mold gravity casting cyl- inder block with hypereutectic aluminum liners. G. Crivellone, Teksid Tech Center ; A. Fuganti, Centro Ricerche Fiat; C. Mus, Tek- sid Tech Center; and D. Salinas, Teksid Aluminio De Mexico. A new category of hypereutectic aluminum liners, made by PM route is now available on the market (SILITEC) and it is success- fully applied to high-pressure die-casting process to produce open deck cylinder blocks. The claimed achievable engine performances over cast-iron liners (weight saving, reduction of oil consumption, optimal heat transfer, wear and friction losses reduction) justify the interest of automotive industry in developing such a technology. The paper will present the experience and the achieved results in permanent mold gravity casting with Silitec liners, where metal flow definition and temperature distribution control make the cast- ing technique more challenging for the manufacturing of closed deck cylinder blocks. A full experimentation based on Design Of Experiment (D.O.E.) methodology was carried out by adopting different process parame- ters and different external surface of the liners to maximize the met- allurgical bonding between liners and crankcase without having liner melting and deformations. A FEM thermo-structural analysis of the engine was performed in order to evaluate the influence of bonding on the engine performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0403. (SP-1610) Impact of decarburization on the fatigue life of powder metal forged connecting rods. E. Ilia, MascoTech Sintered Components; and R. A. Chernenkoff, Ford Motor Co. A main requirement for a satisfactory function and service life of a forged powder metal connecting rod is the fatigue strength. Fatigue strength mainly depends on design, material, microstruc- ture, and surface condition. Much work has been accomplished to optimize these factors, but still a variety of surface defects such as localized porosity, roughness, oxide penetration, decarburization, etc., can be developed during manufacturing. These surface defects impact the fatigue strength in various ways. The impact of the decarburized layer depth on the fatigue life of a forged powder metal connecting rod is the focus of this work. Several connecting rods were submitted to a Weibull test at the same loading pattern. After the fatigue tests, the connecting rods were divided into groups with different decarburized layer depths. Both Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) and Rank Regression (RR) techniques were used to analyze test results from all the groups obtained. Several methods were applied in order to test data sets for significant differences. Considering the results of this study, it can be said that decarbu- rized layer depths up to 0.400 mm do not significantly impact the fatigue life of a forged powder metal connecting rod. For decarbu- rized layer depths higher than 0.400 mm, the fatigue life decreases. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 56</page><page sequence="56">2001-01-0404-2001-01-041 1 2001-01-0404. (SP- 1610) Newly developed P/M materials to replace malleable and ductile cast irons. Michael C. Baran , Fran- cis G. Hanejko, W. Brian James , and K. S. Narasimhan , Hoeganaes Corp. Malleable and ductile cast irons are used extensively in automo- tive applications such as clutches, gears, carriers, shafts, bearings, cam, racers, hubs, etc. Recently developed P/M materials can be processed cost efficiently to replace malleable and ductile iron cast- ings. An UTS in excess of 1240 MPa and a YS in excess of 825 MPa can be achieved with one of these new materials. These tensile prop- erties can be coupled with elongations over 2% and impact energies over 25 Joules. This presentation will cover processing routes for these new materials and will identify parts that may benefit from this new tech- nological advancement. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0405.

The rapid pace of change in the transportation industry is leading design and product engineers to reconsider traditional notions in the design of both new and existing components and systems. The need to remove weight from vehicles to improve gas mileage and meet stringent pollution control regulations while achieving higher per- formance are some of the major challenges confronting the engineer today. 2001-01-0406. (SP- 1603) Mechanical properties of high per- formance aluminum castings. Alan P. Druschitz, Thomas E. P rucha, Adam E. Kopper , and Thomas A. Chadwick , Internet Corp. Squeeze casting and semi-solid metal forming produce alumi- num castings with exceptional properties. This paper compares the mechanical properties and microstructures of a production compo- nent processed by a variety of casting processes and heat treatments. Note, in all cases, the current insert tool used for squeeze casting was adapted to be utilized in the various semi-solid metal forming processes. The results showed that semi- solid metal forming produced con- sistently better mechanical properties compared to squeeze casting. Defects, primarily oxide films, were determined to be responsible for the lower and less consistent properties of the squeeze cast material. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0407.

(SP- 1603) An ADI crankshaft designed for high performance in TVR's Tuscan Speed Six sports car. Kristin R. Brandenberg , Applied Process Inc.; John Ravens croft, TVR Engineering Ltd.; Arron Rimmer , ADI Treatments Ltd.; and Kathy L. Hayrynen, Applied Process Inc. The TVR Tuscan Speed Six, (produced by TVR Engineering in Blackpool, England) is a high-performance automobile, by any measure. This low- volume sports car weighs 1,100 kg (2,420 lbs) and is powered by a 4-liter in-line six-cylinder engine that develops over 350 bhp and 310 ft-lb of torque. TVR Engineering selected an Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI) crankshaft for its combination of low cost, low weight and high torsional strength. Not since Ford dabbled with ADI in its race cars in the 1980' s has a manufacturer chosen ADI for its crankshafts. Although virtually all the major automotive producers and the Motor Industries Research Associa- tion (MIRA) have investigated ADI for use in crankshafts, this is the only known production application of ADI crankshafts in auto- mobiles. ADI presents a useful set of properties for the design engineer. With ever increasing specific power requirements for new engine designs, new material/process combinations for engine components are being explored. This paper will discuss the properties of ADI, the reason for its selection for this crankshaft, and its suitability for this application. 2001-01-0409.

Daeth, Ford Motor Company Ltd.; and U. Reuter and H . Schulz , University of Darmstadt. The influence of graphite shape, pearlite content and chemical composition have been investigated to determine their effect on the machinability of compacted graphite iron (CGI). In the comparison to gray iron, the reduced sulfur content of CGI prevents the benefi- cial formation of a protective manganese sulfide layer on the cutting insert. This accounts for much of the difference in tool life during high-speed continuous cutting. Beyond this critical mechanism, the machinability of CGI can be optimized by providing a consistent, low nodularity microstructure with a minimum of tramp elements such as titanium and chromium that form abrasive inclusions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0410.

Prucha, INTERMET Corporation Headquar- ters; and Joe Barry and David Patterson, INTERMET Stevensville Plant. In each aluminum structural casting process, inherent limitations are exhibited either in performance or manufacturing cost. These processes include well documented technologies, such as low pres- sure, vacuum-assisted casting, combinations of low pressure and vacuum, and squeeze casting. In most cases, performance is hin- dered by non-uniform metal flow, entrainment of gases during the mold filling process, or segregation of impurities during solidifica- tion. 57</page><page sequence="57">2001-01-041 1-2001-01-0420 The development of the pressure counter pressure casting pro- cess eliminates these deficiencies by controlling mold fill to insure true metal flow uniformity, preventing the entrance of gases during filling and providing for both directional and uniform solidification. This results in outstanding strength and ductility for components, such as steering knuckles, produced by the PCPC process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0412.

Sachdev, General Motors Corporation R&amp;D Center. The fundamental relationship between semi-solid processing and microstructure and their effect on the flow characteristics of semi- solid metals have been studied for several years. However, how the process related microstructure influences fatigue properties has not been given the same attention. This study examines the influence of process-related microstructure on the fatigue properties of semi- solid formed A357 alloys. High-solid-fraction (62% solid) and low- solid-fraction (31% and 36% solid) semi-solid formed A357 was tested in axial fatigue with a stress ratio (R) equal to -1. The high- solid-fraction (HSF) material had better fatigue properties than the low-solid-fraction (LSF) material. This is attributed to the fatigue crack initiation mechanisms, as related to the fatigue crack initiation features and the strengths of the materials. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0414.

Barone, Teksid; Gary Scholl, Metal Casting Technology; and Graziano Mortori, Idra Presse. The Hot Isostatic Pressing process on a commercial basis has been applied only to high cost castings (aerospace and racing). Porosity elimination is the application purpose, saving a casting from unacceptable levels of porosity. H.I.P. is very expensive. Man- ufacturing cost of aerospace and racing castings is very high so H.I.P. is accepted because economically convenient. This paper reviews and discusses: 1) The development of an innovative Hot Isostatic Pressing process named Liquid Hot Iso- static Pressing with the goal to overcame the cost issue of gas H.I.P., 2) L.H.I.P. effect on Mechanical Properties of Treated Specimens versus not treated and Comparison of Treated Castings versus not treated, 3) Range of Components this process can be applied to. The potential of high-strength, very light and cost-effective alu- minum casting production can be achieved by utilization of the L.H. I.P. process. 2001-01-0415. (SP- 1622) Magnesium casting applications in the automotive industry. Roderick J. Esdaile, Australian Magne- sium Corp. The last ten years has seen the North American automotive industry increasing its use of magnesium castings at an annual rate of around 15% and this rate of growth is expected to continue for at least the next ten years. The main driving force for this increasing use of magnesium is the need to reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel economy. Magnesium alloys are amongst the lightest structural materials available, however, they do cost more per unit mass than competing materials such as steel and aluminum and the automotive industry is reluctant to pay a premium for weight saving. However, in spite of an apparent cost penalty, magnesium castings are cur- rently used in a number of automotive body, chassis and powertrain applications and this paper will review these applications. There is also a significant potential for future growth in the use of magne- sium casting by the automotive industry where there may be little or no cost penalty. This is being brought about by a better under- standing of the casting design optimization process, the behavior of magnesium during the casting process, particularly the high pressure die casting process, and the development of new and improved mag- nesium casting alloys. Recent developments in these areas will also be reviewed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0419. (SP- 1622) Study, simulation and optimization of the induction reheating of a magnesium billet cast by Thixomag® process. Severine Suk and Philippe Vars, Valeo Wiper Systems; and Jean Collot, Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris. Semi-solid metal forming processes are of large industrial inter- est for the production of various components. Reduction of macro- segregation, reduction of porosity, possibility of near net shape are the principal advantages over casting, forging and powder metal- lurgy techniques. This paper gives a brief description of the Thixomag® process applied to a AZ91D magnesium alloy. As it is well known, special material properties are required for the thixoforming process. It is especially necessary to homogenize the temperature along the billet during the induction reheating. This homogenization of temperature enables to avoid the coarsening of the primary solid phase and defects in the final part. To determine the optimum conditions and to reduce the process duration, numerical simulation has been used. A 2D model, where thermal and electromagnetic are coupled, was built. ANS YS, a commercial and multi-physic simulation software with the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method was chosen to solve this problem. This study helps us to decrease the process development dura- tion. After measurements and validation, a parametric study was carried out. Thanks to design of experiment methods, the process could be optimized in term of duration. The most significant param- eters among heating step, heating time, voltage, length and number of phases, etc., could be pointed out from this design of experiments methods. Comparison between simulation results and experimental data such as a study with Infrared camera device was performed and shows good agreement. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0420. (SP- 1622) Study of mechanical properties of both magnesium alloys AZ91D and AM50A cast by Thixomag® process influence of microstructure. Severine Suk, Valeo Wiper Systems; and Jean Collot, Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris. The forming of alloys from the liquid state can be realized thanks to various casting technologies where the temperature of the metal is high enough to fill a given die correctly. A variety of casting defects often occur in the final part, such as gas porosity, shrinkage porosity and hot cracking. In the case of the magnesium foundry, all handling of molten metal requires serious safety precautions to avoid explosion and burning. Protective gas mixtures (SFö, SO2, CO2) are used to mini- mize the ignition risks but have a bad impact on the environment. The semi-solid forming operates using a lower temperature in the solidus-liquidus range and seems to be interesting, in particular, for the quality requests of the die caster and for safety and a clean envi- ronment. The purpose of this paper is to present the mechanical results of tensile tests carried out on magnesium standard samples, which are cast by Thixomag® process from the semi-solid state. Two magne- sium alloys AZ91D and AM50A are characterized. 58</page><page sequence="58">200 1 -0 1 -04 1 1 -200 1 -0 1 -0426 The static and dynamic elastic modulus are determined by tensile tests equipped with an extensometer and by an ultrasonic method respectively. In the case of semi-solid samples, the mechanical properties increase and, in particular, the Young's modulus. The porosity ratio of semi-solid parts is lower than that of conventional parts, cast by conventional process. The microstructure and the X-ray analysis display aluminum segregation between the globular particles and the eutectic phase. The aluminum content is around 20 wt% in the eutectic phase. This means that the aluminum is supersaturated in the eutectic and precipitated discontinuously like thin lamella of MgnAli2. This is an intermetallic cubic structure. The size and the shape of globules influence the mechanical properties. This study confirms the first results announced two years ago on the wiper parts. The presence of MgnAl^ lamella reinforces the solid solution, having a hexagonal structure, and improves the Young's modulus. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0421.

It is necessary to evaluate coating systems that are applied on magnesium prior to component assembly. Furthermore, the interaction between coating systems and methods for galvanic corrosion prevention should be considered carefully.

Tiwari, General Motors Research and Development Cen- ter. A family of low-cost, creep-resistant magnesium alloys has been developed. These alloys, containing aluminum, calcium, and stron- tium are designated as "ACX" alloys. Developed for engine blocks and transmissions, the "ACX" alloys have at least 40% greater ten- sile and 25% greater compressive creep resistance than AE42, and corrosion resistance as good as AZ91D (GMPG 9540P/B corrosion test). These alloys are estimated to cost only slightly more than AZ91D and have as good castability. Creep data up to 200°C, tensile properties at room temperature and 175°C, corrosion results and microstructure analysis are presented and discussed. These alloys have the potential to enable the extension of the substantial weight reduction benefits of magnesium to powertrain components. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0423.

This paper describes the tensile creep and microstructure of Mg- Al-Ca-based ACX magnesium alloys being developed for powertrain applications. Important creep parameters, i.e., secondary creep rate and creep strength, for the new alloys are reported. Ten- sile creep properties of the newly developed ACX alloys are signifi- cantly better than those of AE42 alloy, which is the benchmark creep-resistant magnesium die casting alloy. Creep mechanisms for different temperature/stress regimes are proposed. A new intermet- allic phase, (Mg,Al)2Ca, was identified in the microstructure of the ACX alloys, and is proposed to be responsible for the improved creep resistance of the alloys. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0424.

Pierre Labelle, Mihriban Pekguleryuz, and Don Argo, Nor anda Inc.; and Mike Dierks, Todd Sparks, and Ted Waltematte, Spartan Light Metal Products. A new family of heat-resistant alloys has been developed by Noranda Inc. This new alloy system is based on the Mg-Al-Sr sys- tem. The three compositions evaluated in this system, namely (Mg- Al-Sr)l, (Mg-Al-Sr)2 and (Mg-Al-Sr)3, hereafter referred Al, A2 and A3 demonstrate excellent creep and mechanical properties in the 150°C to 175°C temperature range. They possess excellent salt- spray corrosion resistance, comparable to AZ91D and AM type alloys and are superior to AS41 and the aluminum alloy A3 80. This combination of properties makes these alloys suitable for automatic transmission casing, crankcase, oil pump body, oil pan, belt pulley, cylinder cover, engine fan applications as well as other under-the- hood components. The present paper summarizes the mechanical and corrosion properties and die casting of the alloys. The bolt-load- retention test results are also discussed. Diecastability has been improved using a modified alloy composition (A4). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0425. (SP- 1622) Bolt-load retention behavior of a die cast magnesium-rare earth alloy. Ian P. Moreno, Keun Yong Sohn, and J. Wayne Jones, University of Michigan; and John E. Allison, Ford Motor Co. The need for improved understanding of new magnesium alloys for the automotive industry continues to grow as the application for these lightweight alloys expands to more demanding environments, particularly in drivetrain components. Their use at elevated tempera- tures, such as in transmission cases, presents a challenge because magnesium alloys generally have lower creep resistance than alumi- num alloys currently employed for such applications. In this study, a new die-cast magnesium alloy, MEZ, containing rare earth (RE) elements and zinc as principal alloying constituents, was examined for its bolt-load retention (BLR) properties. Preloads varied from 14 to 28 kN and test temperatures ranged from 125 to 175°C. At all test temperatures and preloads, MEZ retained the greatest fraction of the initial imposed preload when compared to the magnesium alloys AZ91D, AE42, AM50, and the AM50+Ca series alloys. The BLR behavior of MEZ did not show significant sensitivity to temperature within the range examined, whereas the other alloys displayed a clear decrease in bolt-load retention with increased temperature at a given preload. Retained bolt-load decreased for MEZ with increas- ing preload in a manner similar to the behavior of other alloys. The higher BLR can be attributed to the greater resistance to creep and arises mainly from the Mg-RE phases present at cell and grain boundaries and the relatively high solidus temperature (Ts) of MEZ. Additional means of improving BLR by varying geometrical dimen- sions in the bolted assembly for AZ91D and AM50 was investigated and no significant improvement were observed in the limited studies that were performed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0426. (SP- 1621) The effect of high mileage spot weld degradation on vehicle body joint stiffness. E. Y. Kuo, M. M. Jayasuriya, and P. Wung, Ford Motor Co. Joint stiffness is a major contributor to the vehicle body overall bending and torsional stiffness which in turn affects the vehicle NVH performance. Each joint consists of spot welds which function as load paths between adjacent sheet metal. Spot welds tend to lose structural integrity as a result of fatigue, loosening, aging, wear and corrosion of parts as a vehicle accumulates mileage. Experimental methods are used to identify potential degradation mechanisms associated with a spot weld. A CAE model which simulates a vehi- cle body joint genetically is used to determine the effects of each individual degradation mode of a spot weld on joint stiffness.

(SP- 1621) Spot weld failure loads under com- bined mode loading conditions. S.-H. Lin and J. Pan , University of Michigan; and S. Wu, T. Tyan , and P. Wung , Ford Motor Co. Failure loads of spot welds are investigated under static and impact loading conditions. A test fixture was designed and used to obtain maximum loads of spot welds under a range of combined opening and shear loads with different loading rates. Optical micro- graphs of the cross sections of spot welds before and after failure were obtained to understand the failure processes under various loading rates and different combinations of loads. The experimental results indicate that under nearly pure opening loads, the failure occurs along the nugget circumferential boundary. Under combined opening and shear loading conditions, the failure starts from the ten- sile side of the base metal near the nugget in a necking/shear failure mode. The effects of sheet thickness and combined load on the load carrying behavior of spot welds are investigated under static and impact loading conditions based on the experimental results. An engineering failure criterion is proposed to characterize the failure loads of spot welds under combined opening and shear loads for both static and impact loading conditions. The engineering failure criterion is expressed as a function of the nugget size, the sheet thickness, the loading angle for characterization of combined loads, and an empirical coefficient for a given loading rate. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0431. (SP- 1621) An experimental and computational study of the dynamic characteristics of spot-welded sheet metal structures. Yi Wang and Teik C. Lim , University of Alabama. In the present study, several welded beam and plate specimens are fabricated using an electrical resistance type spot welder and studied experimentally applying the frequency response function approach. The experimental data is used to guide the dynamic finite element modeling effort, and to determine the weld joint representa- tion that most accurately characterizes the measured dynamic response. The results reveal the compliant nature of the spot welds at higher frequencies and in applications consisting of more com- plex geometrical structures and boundary conditions. This finding shows the inadequacy in the classical rigid element representation that is widely used in current dynamic modeling practices. 2001-01-0432. (SP- 1621) Recent developments in analysis and testing of spot welds. Shicheng Zhang , DaimlerChrysler AG. The recent developments in analysis and testing of spot welds are briefly reviewed in general and the solutions, stress formulas and strain gauge techniques that may be applied to the analysis and test- ing are elaborately introduced in particular. The local stress parame- ters such as notch stress, stress intensity factors and J-integral at a spot weld are generally expressed by the structural stresses around the spot weld. The determination of these parameters are then sim- plified as determining the structural stresses that can be calculated by a spoke pattern for spot welds in finite element analysis. The approximate stress formulas for the structural stress, notch stress and stress intensity factor are given for common spot-welded speci- mens. With the aid of the formulas the test data in terms of the origi- nal load can be easily transformed into the data in terms of the struc- tural stress, notch stress or stress intensity factor at the spot weld. The formulas also facilitate the transfer of the test data across differ- ent specimens. The strain gauge technique developed for a tensile- shear specimen shows that all the structural stress, notch stress, stress intensity factors and J-integral at the spot weld can be deter- mined by two strain gauges attached only to the outer surface of one sheet.

This paper presents and validates a model of fatigue crack propa- gation in resistance spot- welded joints; this model is called the "Structural Stress Model" (SSM). Important features of the SSM are that it is based on the physical evidence of fatigue in spot-welded joints and on well-accepted descriptors of fatigue more generally. Furthermore, it is usable by designers evaluating fatigue response of structures containing multiple welds. Underlying assumptions of the SSM are also reviewed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0435. (SP- 1621) Fatigue analysis of spot welds sub- jected to a variable amplitude loading history. M. E. Barkey and J. Han , University of Alabama. A multiaxial spot weld damage parameter and a basic load-life approach are applied to proportional shear and peel loading for a standard SAE variable amplitude loading history. Miner's rule and the rainflow cycle counting method are used to calculate fatigue damage using constant amplitude load-life test data for various ratios of the combined loading. The calculations are compared to test results for an HSLA galvannealed sheet steel obtained by using the DaimlerChrysler Spot Weld Design Committee multiaxial spot weld test fixture. The applicability of the methods are discussed, as are the crack initiation and propagation behavior of the specimens. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0437.

(SP- 1575) Optimizing mechanical perfor- mance of injection molded multiple gated rotating thermoplas- tic components: Part 1 - Consideration of structural analysis and knit line effects. Val A. Kagan, Julie Mazza, and Igor Palley, Honeywell International. Engineering thermoplastics were successfully utilized in the design of injection molded rotating parts such as the impellers, wheels, and cooling fans of commercial air-cooled chillers, and gas and diesel engines. Complex aerodynamic and mechanical performance of impellers and cooling fans are very important for the efficiency of integrated air-movement, climate control and cooling systems of various types of engines of vehicles, cars, heavy-duty tractors and trucks. The transportation and automotive industries have developed a culture of reliability and cost effectiveness, in which high risks and adven- tures are not encouraged. Due to the wide and ever-increasing application of thermoplas- tics for the transportation and automotive industries, the perfor- mance of the under-the-hood parts depend upon optimized design 60</page><page sequence="60">2001-01-0438-2001-01-0443 and processing technology and properties of polymer-based materi- als. The mechanical properties of the injection-molded thermoplastic components depend on the part and the molding tool design. For injection molding of the multi-blade fans and various rotating plastic parts, the complex of multiple gating injection molding tools were used. Both the design of the various rotating parts (including the industrial and automotive cooling fans), and the molding tool design are very important to get optimum flow patterns and to predict the locations of stress-bearing areas and knit lines (planes). For non-reinforced or non-filled nylon, the mechanical perfor- mance in the knit lines (planes) areas are approximately equal to the mechanical performance of the resin (polyamide) used. Fiber-glass reinforced and fiber-glass/mineral nylons have mechanical proper- ties of plastic in the knit (weld) line (plane) and is different from basic mechanical properties of reinforced plastic due to flow pat- terns and local fiber- glass re-orientation in the weld plane areas. Due to the above changes, the weld planes (lines) become likely areas of crack initiation and propagation and possible molded part failure or damage. In this investigation, we are presenting the results of analytical structural analysis and design optimization of various multiple gated rotating thermoplastic parts such as wheels, impellers, and multi- blade fans with an external ring under the influence of mechanical parameters of fiber-glass reinforced plastic in local knit (weld) plane areas. For determination of these mechanical properties in local (weld plane) and bulk (molded part) areas, the influence of molding (melt and mold temperatures, shear rate, etc.), and end-use (strain rate, temperature, moisture, etc.) conditions should be taken in to account. The results from this study should help designers to accurately interpret the results of structural analysis and complex tensile (as basic) properties, such as strength, deformation and fatigue of nylon based plastics and to utilize these important material parameters at end-use conditions for a part life assessment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0439.

Nylon (polyamide)-based plastics are used widely for automotive cooling fans and various under-the-hood injection- molded components.

Both the design of the various rotating parts (including industrial and automotive cooling fan, and the molding tool design are very important to get optimum flow patterns and to predict the locations and interaction of stress-bearing areas and knit lines (planes or inter-phases). The mechanical performance of the injection-molded thermoplastic components depends on the pecu- liarity of the part and the molding tool design. In Part 1 of this paper, we are presenting results of structural design analysis (comprehensive analytical and linear FEA) and design optimization of a multiple gated rotating components with a ring under the influence of the design parameters. In Part 2 of this paper, we are discussing the mechanical properties of fiber-glass- reinforced thermoplastic in local (weld plane) and bulk (molded part) areas with the influence of molding and end-use conditions. The analysis of this study shows, that for non-reinforced or non- filled nylon, the mechanical performance in the knit-line (weld plane) areas are approximately equal to the mechanical performance of used resin (polyamide). For fiber-glass reinforced and fiber-glass/mineral nylons, the mechanical properties of plastic in the knit (weld) line (plane) are different from the basic mechanical properties of reinforced plastic due to flow patterns and local fiber-glass re-orientation in the weld plane areas.

(SP-1575) Vibration welding of glass-filled nylon 66 - Effect of part geometry. Jack MacDonald and Phil Bates, Royal Military College of Canada; and Hua Liang, DuPont Canada. The purpose of this study was to determine the adequacy of butt and T-shape welds in predicting the burst strength of realistic nylon 66 parts. This study assessed the effects and interactions of vibration welding process parameters using a central composite design of experiment on selected part geometries. The results confirm that butt- welded plaques exhibit higher weld strengths under tensile load than T-welded plaques and simple cup-plaque parts. These latter two welds were typically 50% weaker than butt welds. A compari- son of weld strengths suggests that the lab-scale T-joint geometry more closely models more complex vibration welded parts. 2001-01-0441. (SP-1575) Forward to better understanding of optimized performance of welded joints: Local reinforcement and memory effects for polyamides. Val A. Kagan, Honeywell International A comparative study of the mechanical performance of welded polyamide joints is evaluated. Under optimized welding (linear and orbital vibration, hot plate, transmission laser) conditions, the tensile strength of welded polyamide/nylon (filled and fiber-reinforced) is close or slightly higher (up to 14%) than the tensile strength of the base polymer (non-filled polyamide). In this study, the influence of two important effects (local rein- forcement and "memory") on the mechanical performance of poly- amide/nylon welds is analyzed and discussed. The results presented in this study will help plastic part designers, material developers and manufacturers, choose optimized welding conditions for polyamide/ nylon parts in a wide range of industrial applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0442. Performance of long glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic automotive part by surface finishing/compression molding process. Stephen McCarthy, Qing Guan, Shawn McCar- thy, Malar Rohith Shetty, and Thomas Ellison, University of Massa- chusetts; and Arthur Delusky, ValTek LLC. The Valyi surface finishing/compression molding process (SFC) has successfully been used to produce large structural panels with Class A finishing films under low pressure using short glass/carbon fiber reinforced materials and engineering materials. The material used in the SFC process must meet certain performance require- ments in order to fully exploit the capability of the process. This paper reports the mechanical properties and rheological properties of short and long glass and carbon fiber reinforced materials. The fiber distribution in the parts produced by SFC have been compared to that from conventional injection molding. The long fiber rein- forced PP resins show enhanced stiffness and impact strength. The methods of improving appearance due to long fiber read through have been investigated in this paper. 2001-01-0443. New weatherable film technology to eliminate painting of automotive exteriors. Venkatakrishnan Umamaheswa- ran, GE Plastics; and Abeer Truesdail, GE Structured Products. 61</page><page sequence="61">200 1 -0 1 -0443-200 1 -0 1 -0448 Automobile manufacturers are currently searching for ways to eliminate the traditional painting process employed in assembly plants to decorate and protect the exterior of an automobile. The entire paint facility in a typical assembly plant runs anywhere from $200,000,000 to $600,000,000 and can occupy 50% or more of the factory floor. Add to this the cost of environmental compliance, energy, raw materials and labor and it's easy to see why elimination of the paint operation can be a high benefit to car manufacturers. GE Plastics has recently developed a novel polymeric film that can eliminate the need to paint. The film is based on a new polymer invented recently at GE CR&amp;D in Schenectady, NY. This polymeric film can be applied over a variety of thermoplastic and thermoset substrates through an in-mold decoration (IMD) process to yield Class A, pre-finished exterior panels and trim that can then be assembled without the need for painting. Plastic body panels can also reduce mass, offer designers a greater degree of freedom with shapes, geometry and colors, enable customization, and provide a damage-resistant and corrosion-free exterior to the end user. This paper will outline the performance attributes of SOLLX® film as compared to paint and other alternatives. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0444. New scratch measurement technique for exte- rior body systems. P. Rangarajan , V. H. Watkins, K. Harding , and M. Blohm, GE Corporate Research &amp; Development; and Venkatakrishnan Unamaheswaran, GE Plastics. This paper will describe a novel method for quantifying the per- ceived scratch and mar susceptibility of polymer surfaces. For auto- motive applications the relevant parameter that determines customer satisfaction is the visual perception of scratch and mar. Visual per- ception of a discontinuity on a surface is based on the contrast between the damaged area and its surroundings. The observed con- trast differences are a function of the way in which light is scattered from the damaged area, as well as the illumination and observation angles. We have developed an imaging system that uses two geome- tries to capture the major contrast elements differentiating a scratch from its surroundings. The data from the two geometries are pro- cessed to extract values for reflectivity of the sample surface as well as that of the damaged area under the two observation conditions. The optical imaging data will subsequently be related to data col- lected from visual assessments by test groups of people to generate a numeric assessment of Visual Quality. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0445. Predicting impact performance of painted thermoplastic exterior body panels. Joe Woods , Steve Patterson , and Cindy Roberts , GE Plastics. Automotive exterior paint systems can significantly affect the impact performance of thermoplastic body panels. To utilize the benefits of predictive engineering as a tool to assist in the design and development of thermoplastic body panels, thermoplastic body panel materials have been characterized with typical automotive paint systems for use for finite element modeling and analysis. Paint systems used for exterior body panels can vary from rigid to more flexible, depending on the vehicle manufacturer's specifica- tions. Likewise, thermoplastics for body panels, vary in mechanical properties, primarily depending on the heat performance require- ments of the application. To understand the effects of paint systems on impact performance of thermoplastic body panels, two different paint systems, representing "rigid" and "more flexible," were evalu- ated on two body panel grades of thermoplastics with different mechanical properties. A two-step process was followed to characterize the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic-paint system. First, the deformation properties of the thermoplastic materials were determined, including the modulus, yield stress, and post-yield behavior. Next, the failure criteria of the painted systems were determined by correlating experimental failure displacements of painted disk specimens with maximum principal stress levels obtained through finite element simulation of the disk impact tests. Unpainted disks, disks impacted on their painted side and disks impacted on their unpainted side were tested. Tests were performed at two temperatures, 23 °C and -30°C, over a range of strain rates. The results of the material char- acterization, deformation models, and failure criteria as a function of rate and temperature were incorporated into a user-defined mate- rial subroutine for use in finite element analyses. To validate the material model described above, fender impact testing was performed on full-scale fenders and load-displacement traces were recorded along with failure information. Next, finite ele- ment analyses were performed simulating the fender impact tests. The material model was evaluated based on its ability to predict the failure behavior of the fender as well as its ability to match the experimental load-displacement trace. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0446. Conductive polyphenylene ether/polyamide blend for Saturn exterior body panels. Vauhini Telikapalli, Gen- eral Motors Corp.; and Steve Patterson , GE Plastics. The evolution toward the use of electrostatic painting processes has been driven primarily by environmental legislation and efforts to improve efficiencies in the painting process. The development of conductive substrate material compliments the industry trend toward a green environment through further reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds during the painting process. Traditionally, electrostatic painting of thermoplastics requires that a conductive primer be applied to the substrate prior to topcoat application. The conductive polymer blend of polyphenylene ether, and polyamide provides sufficient conductivity to eliminate usage of conductive primers. Additional benefits include improved trans- fer efficiencies of the primer and top coat systems, uniform film builds across the part, and improved painting of complex geome- tries. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that this conduc- tive polymer blend provides painting performance equivalent to steel without compromising the finished product performance. Sta- tistical analysis of test data from plaques and parts was completed to assess the physical property performance of the material. Paint trials were conducted to measure paint transfer efficiency, film builds, and surface appearance. Additionally, studies were con- ducted on panel assemblies in a lab environment to evaluate dimen- sional stability through simulated environmental conditions. Test description, data, and conclusions are discussed in this paper. 2001-01-0447. (SP- 1595) Considerations in LED photometry. Scott Jennato and Greg McKee , Labsphere, Inc. Characteristics of light emitting diodes (LEDs), including physi- cal size, flux levels, spectrum and spatial distribution, separate them from typical element sources, which are generally employed and measured for photometric and radiometric quantities. With an LED it is often difficult to achieve a high level of photometric or radio- metric measurement accuracy, due to uncertainties within the mea- surement equipment and improper test setup. In addition, traditional photometers, because of their inability to simulate the response of the human eye at the ends of the visible spectrum, generate signifi- cantly flawed data when testing red, blue, and some styles of white LEDs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0448.

(SP- 1595) Solid light guide optics for thin lamp applications. Detlef Decker, HELLA KG Hueck &amp; Co. Today's requests from automotive manufacturers for innovative designs for signal and interior lamps are driven by three typical tasks: Saving space and depth in the lamp for easier and cost-saving integration in the body construction. Lamp thickness should be reduced to a technically achievable minimum. A homogeneous illu- mination needs to be realized with a minimum number of emitters (particular with LED). Line design should be supported by reliable technologies, enabling stylists to develop contour-driven designs. All these demands can be supported by "Solid Light Guide Optics." In this optical concept a solid light guide with the basic geometry of a tube receives the light from a light source (bulb or LED) directly, or via an additional flexible light guide. The rays are transmitted in the circular solid light guide by total internal reflec- tion and will be also coupled out partly with the aid of prisms or structures on the rear side of the longitudinal axis of the guide. Pre- cise optical calculation allows a homogenous illuminated line design to be developed, which can successfully achieve the requested light distribution for various signal functions and other illumination tasks. This paper will attempt to demonstrate the possibilities for sev- eral applications with realized concepts and additional demonstra- tions for future systems. 2001-01-0450. (SP- 1595) Modular surface mount led assem- blies for signal lighting. Bachi Bernhard and Hofmann Markus, OSRAM Opto Semiconductors; and Hackl Johannes, Swoboda GmbH Advancements in LED brightness have opened new applications in the field of exterior lighting. The properties of LEDs introduce new requirements in the areas of mounting and lamp-assembly design. Designs must take into account all interacting factors that can impact system performance, such as color, peak candela, off- axis light distributions and thermal management. In addition, designers want to contour the RCL (Rear Combination Light) around the corner in the X-as well as the Y-axis of the car to realize different 3-D shapes. The use of SMT High Flux LED is a new inno- vative submount technology that fulfills design freedom and ease of assembly into lamp housings. An additional advantage is low ther- mal resistance to drive the LED with the highest possible current allowing high optical efficiency. Furthermore, these solutions need to be very cost efficient. The advantages of this concept will be described in general, including production flow, as well as thermal and optical investigations. The mentioned solution based on so- called "submodules" that are sufficiently arranged can realize all wishes of the designer while fulfilling production and technical efforts. In addition, the production flow will be described. After- wards, possible applications for RCL and CHMSL will be shown. Also mentioned is a new Super Flux SMT LED (used also for indi- rect lighting) driven with a current &gt;300 mA and a Flux of about 25 to 40 lm. This is possible due to new technologies allowing low thermal resistance assembly methods. Examples will be given to show how this kind of module can help solve heatflow problems in this case. 2001-01-0451. (SP- 1595) High efficiency light source for dis- tributive lighting systems (DLS). Thomas Luce, Arnold Stout, and Josef Schug, Philips Automotive Lighting. DLS offers exciting new possibilities for design and performance of headlamps. The powerful HID source technology is ideally suited to serve as light source for such a DLS, combining the benefits of both technologies to a completely new headlighting concept. The intention of the paper is to give an impression of the effi- ciency and performance of the system and to point out the prerequi- sites and parameters for the light source that influence the perfor- mance. Starting from the performance of present HID headlamps and based on sound considerations of losses of the various components of a DLS, the beam requirements are traced back to the necessary properties of a HID light source and bulb driver dedicated for DLS. From both calculations and measurements an estimation of the overall performance for the system is derived, with focus on incou- pling efficiency. 2001-01-0452.

"The diversification of headlamp lens surface designs in con- junction with changes in automobile style and the demand for brighter headlamps." In recent years, as automobile designs have become more diverse, the shapes of headlamps have also changed and novel designs have become popular. However, if these new types of headlamps are designed using conventional methods, it is hard to make them satisfy basic headlamp performance requirements, and thus it has been considered difficult to provide both novelty of design and adequate safety in the same lamp. However, at the 1999 SAE Convention the authors reported on the development of an ultra-thin "Line-Beam Headlamp" with a height of 30 mm. The report elicited numerous responses from the automobile industry, and many of these concerned the demand for a vertical type of "Line-Beam Headlamp" design. The authors sought to evolve the "Line-Beam Headlamp" technology further and have succeeded in developing a "Vertical Shape Line-Beam Headlamp" that satisfies the demand. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0455. (SP- 1595) Signal image enhancement of pro- jection-type headlamps by additional optics. Henning Weinhold, Doris Boebel, and Heike Fröhlich, Automotive Lighting. The percentage of cars using a projection- type headlamp is grow- ing quickly. Lens diameters of 40 mm, 60 mm, and 70 mm are being used in combination with halogen bulbs and gas discharge lamps. The signal image of such projection systems can be improved by increasing the light-emitting area with additional optics around the lens. This results in a more comfortable appearance of the headlamps from the viewpoint of oncoming cars. Different optical elements, e.g., Fresnel lenses, prisms, segmented reflectors, are used. 63</page><page sequence="63">2001-01-0455-2001-01-0463 A large set of existing projection systems with additional optics around the projection lens is examined and rated by test persons regarding glare, size of the signal image and homogeneity.

(SP- 1595) TIR reflectors for rear lamps. Pierro Salvatore, Automotive Lighting. Spherical, aspherical Fresnel lenses and pillow lenses have an extensive use in rear lamp design. These systems, using refraction or TIR (Total Internal Reflection), allow to control the geometrical spread and the photometry of the luminous flux. A transparent system guarantees a homogeneous and uniform light distribution, attractive appearance, lower costs and reduced overall dimensions. Nevertheless a simple lens system hasn't enough efficiency in collecting luminous flux. Generally the solid angle subtended by lens is small and to improve the optical efficiency, designers use reflectors. TIR reflectors are transparent segmented surfaces, which match the traditional lens performances with high efficiency and new style. This paper discusses the principles, features and performances of TIR reflectors. It also presents the new software developed to design these systems, showing the achieved results. 2001-01-0457. (SP- 1595) Design of reflector optics with smooth surface for automotive lamps. Jung-Hyang Park, Samlip Co. Ltd.; and Jong-Youb Sah, Yeungnam Univ. ACRs (All Clear Reflectors), also widely referred to as FFRs (Free Form Reflectors), were designed in general and intelligent ways using a NURBS surface for the mathematical modeling of the reflector shape and artificial intelligence as the optimum design algorithm. An ACR, which consists of a continuous surface reflector and clear outer lens, offers styling advantages and provides a high quality light performance. The clear outer lens of an ACR remains efficient even with a highly inclined shape, as in the design of a sports car, plus the complete clearness of the reflector surface elimi- nates the nuisance of stray light caused by the steps between individ- ual segments of multi-faced reflectors. The design technique of an ACR was also successfully applied and tested with all types of lamps, including low beams, high beams, fog lamps, and turn signal lamps. 2001-01-0458. (SP- 1595) Double reflection concept applied to rear lamps design. Luca Sardi and Maria Teresa Dalmasso, Auto- motive Lighting. When designing new rear lamps the hardest effort is to create something that satisfies the sake of novelty of the car maker. Main tasks of rear lamps are as follows: they must fulfil photometrical requirements, be as cheap as possible, fit into the vehicle body and appear "interesting" under the stylistic point of view. This is the case of "second reflection rear lamps": the light of the lamp is collected by a primary reflector that deviates it on a secondary segmented reflector, the conjunction of the first and second reflector gives the needed angular deviation. These devices offer the novelty of a hid- den source and of an innovative outer aspect when compared to the "single reflection rear lamps" due to the fact that some sectors appear brilliant and some dark. In this paper, different mathematical concepts of the double reflection reflectors for rear lighting are explained as well as the dif- ferent approaches used to calculate them and the SW tools used. The wide range of style results are illustrated by means of concrete examples. 2001-01-0459. (SP- 1595) The low-beam design guidelines for The U.S. market.

Power and Asso- ciates 1998 Initial Quality Study (IQS) - ("Headlights not aimed properly" question). We investigated beam patterns that ranged from high to low customer preference.

George latan, Bernard Caire, and Frédérique Pichot, DBM Reflex Enterprises Inc. 4 &amp; 5 mm reflex prisms are newborn options in automotive light- ing design. They are very useful for new styling configurations, especially when mixed with optics. But 4 &amp; 5 mm reflex patterns can create defaults directly linked to these prisms' size. These defaults can be sink marks or surface distortions. They affect the photometrical output and the overall aspect of molded lenses. Thus the 4 &amp; 5 mm reflex prisms' use requires an increased pre- cision regarding the effective optical angles in order to obtain a pho- tometrical quality comparable to the one with conventional size of prisms (2.38 mm). 2001-01-0461. Simulating rear-end collision warnings using field operational test data. Richard A. Glassco and Daniel S. Cohen, Mitretek Systems. This paper discusses the definition and performance of the warn- ing algorithm in a potential Rear-End Collision Avoidance System (RECAS). Given vehicle range, velocity, and leader deceleration data, the warning algorithm computes whether imminent braking is required to prevent a collision with a vehicle directly ahead, and determines whether a warning should be given to alert the driver. The result of the study is an estimate of the number of warnings per hour under normal driving conditions for various types of drivers. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0462.

Forward collision warning (FCW) systems are intended to pro- vide drivers with crash alerts to help them avoid or mitigate rear-end crashes. To facilitate successful deployment of FCW systems, the Ford-GM Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP) developed preliminary minimum functional requirements for FCW systems implemented on light vehicles (passenger cars, light trucks, and vans). This paper summarizes one aspect of the CAMP results: minimum requirements and recommendations for when to present rear-end crash alerts to the driver. These requirements are valid over a set of kinematic conditions that are described, and assume success- ful tracking and identification of a legitimate crash threat. The results are based on extensive closed-course human factors testing that studied drivers' last-second braking preferences and capabili- ties. The paper reviews the human factors testing, modeling of results, and the computation of FCW crash alert timing requirements and recommendations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0463.

This paper extends earlier work on the small female and mid-sized male Hybrid Ills to new work on the 6-year-old Hybrid III. Testing was conducted with 6-year-old chil- dren human volunteer subjects using three sensor technologies, capacitive, electric field, and ultrasonic. This testing was conducted in the laboratory with the sensors mounted at the face/chest level of the children. The capacitive and electric field sensor responses to the 6-year-old Hybrid III and children were more similar than the response of the sensors to the 5th percentile female and 50th percen- tile male Hybrid III crash test dummies to the comparable adult human subjects. The ultrasonic test results for child human subjects and 6-year-old Hybrid III followed the same pattern as that found in the adult test results. 2001-01-0468. (SP- 1596) Investigation of alternative data compression/transmission methodologies. Matthew G. Bevan, David D. Stott, and Paul D. Schwartz , Johns Hopkins Univ. This paper examined existing data acquisition technologies and proposes an alternative method to gather and store data. This pro- posed method significantly reduces the size of the cable bundle that interconnects the crash test dummy with the control room, vehicle or sled mounted to five wires, three for power, two for the communi- cations bus. A systems analysis reviewed the requirements for data acquisition for crash test dummies and determined that the proposed system, a distributed data acquisition system, was a promising solu- tion to the problem. This approach would replace one central data acquisition system with numerous data acquisition systems distrib- uted through out the dummy. Each distributed data acquisition mod- ule would have eight channels and could be used singly or in groups. At the core of each module would be an Analog Devices ADuC812 component that handles the analog to digital conversion, data acqui- sition control, memory management, and the communications bus. The project took this component and designed the power, signal conditioning, and memory circuits needed to support the ADuC812. Most of the design was assembled into a breadboard and electrically tested to measure its performance. Its performance met expectation and showed that this approach would be successful. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0469. (SP- 1596) Meeting interior head impact requirements: A basic scientific approach. Val A. Bellora and Ryan Krauss, Johnson Controls, Inc.; and Lambert Van Poolen, Calvin College. FMVSS201U is a Federal Regulation intended to reduce head injury of occupants in motor vehicle collisions. Thus far the industry has made efforts to understand and implement measures to pass the specification. Our team has benchmarked current work, developed the fundamental physics, and then tested our theories in the labora- tory and in actual vehicles. The Force versus Deflection Curve (FDC) is the primary tool used to understand performance of a given hit as well as countermeasure (CM) material/structure design. Spe- cific parameters such as the shape, length, and height of the FDC are used as design criteria. Physical limits are presented as well as reasonable expectations of real data. A procedure is presented to design for passing the FMVSS201U test. The intent of this paper is to provide readers with a way to methodically step through the design, test and analysis and thus eliminating a random and expen- sive attempt to pass the test. The strategy to pass FMVSS201 becomes shaping the FDC so that the area under the curve (which is a constant of 102 J) is as narrow (lower deflection) as possible without exceeding a height of 6.2 kN. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0470. (SP- 1596) Advancements in testing methodolo- gies in response to the FMVSS 201U requirements for curtain- type side airbags. Helen A. Kaleto, David Winkelbauer, Chris J. Havens, and Michael Smith, MGA Research Corp. Vehicle manufacturers are developing dynamically deploying upper interior head protection systems to provide added occupant protection in lateral crashes. These devices are used to protect the head and neck areas and to prevent ejection from the vehicle. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has established requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 201 for these systems. This paper will discuss testing methodologies in the areas of component testing of curtain-type side airbag systems and full-scale side impact testing of a vehicle into a rigid pole. These testing methodologies have been created as a direct result of the development phase of several airbag systems. Prior to pole impact testing, tests have been developed which evaluate these types of systems for characteristics such as inflation time, fill capacity, and how long the system stays inflated during side impact and rollover simulations. Also, temperature effects and impact configurations have been investigated in order to clearly understand the dynamics of such systems. As a result, several new component-level tests are being conducted which investigate these issues. Concerning side impact pole crash testing, the method of vehicle towing is very important. Two methods of towing vehicles laterally will be compared; sliding the vehicle with low friction pads and roll- ing the vehicle on pneumatic wheel dollies. Photographs and dia- grams will be presented showing the equipment used for each method. Data will be presented showing the variation in impact points and angles at impact. A comparison of data with two identical vehicles using the two methods will be presented. Both methods presented are used throughout the automotive industry. The condition of the test track has a great influence on which method is most effective. For tracks with minor imperfec- tions, greater flexibility is available in choosing a method. For tracks with surface variations, the wheel dolly method appears to perform best. The wheel dolly method also allows the vehicle to be towed at angles up to 25 degrees from perpendicular. This is very benefi- cial for accident reconstruction/ simulation purposes. Readers of this paper will gain a much broader understanding of curtain airbag development testing procedures, equipment, and pole impact crash testing practices in general. 2001-01-0471. (SP- 1596) Dynamic tensile tests on foams. Susan I. Hill, University of Dayton Research Institute. 65</page><page sequence="65">2001-01-0471-2001-01-0476 Crash simulation models require dynamic material property data to produce realistic predictions. The models often have to simulate multi-layered components that can contain polymers, foams, and metals. This paper describes a pilot study on the dynamic tensile properties of energy absorbing foams. The first phase consisted of the development of tensile test proce- dures suitable for high rate testing of foams. The second phase involved dynamic tensile tests on foams at rates up to 3.0 m/s. A half-scale ASTM D 1623 Type A cylindrical tensile dog-bone was used for the dynamic tests. The pilot study showed that dynamic tests on foam were possi- ble. The dynamic ultimate tensile strength, failure strain, and stiff- ness of three foams at various rates were measured. The groundwork has been laid for the development of a foam tensile test standard for the automotive industry, with the potential of generating shared databases. The project was financed by General Motors Corporation (GM) pursuant to an agreement between General Motors Corporation and the U. S. Department of Transportation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0472. (SP- 1596) Constitutive modeling of polymers subjected to high strain rates. Peter G. Martin and Jeff R. Cran- dall, University of Virginia. A biaxial test procedure is used to assess the constitutive proper- ties of polymers in tension. The constitutive constants are derived for high strain rate applications such as those associated with crash- worthiness studies. The test procedure is used in conjunction with a time- and strain-dependent quasi-linear viscoelastic constitutive law consisting of a Mooney-Rivlin formulation combined with Maxwell elements. The procedure is demonstrated by describing the stress versus strain relationship of a rubber specimen subjected to a step-relaxation input. The constitutive equation is transformed from a non-linear convolution integral to a set of first order differen- tial equations. These equations, with the appropriate boundary con- ditions, are solved numerically to obtain transient stresses in two principal directions. Material constants for use in the explicit LS- Dyna non-linear finite element code are provided. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0473. (SP- 1596) Effect of epoxy-based structural foam on energy management: An experimental and analytical investigation. Jamil M. Alwan, Chi-Chin Wu, and Clifford C. Chou, Ford Motor Co. The effect of epoxy-based structural foam on strength, stiffness, and energy absorption of foam-filled structural components is inves- tigated and implemented to formulate design guidelines that can be used in enhancing weight reduction and engineering functions of systems. An experimental approach is first utilized to identify design vari- ables such as foam density, gage and foam layer thickness, that are needed to enhance the weight/performance ratio of structural hat- section components. A CAE approach using nonlinear, large defor- mation finite element analysis is used to model the hat-section com- ponents. An acceptance level of confidence in the CAE analytical tools is then established based on comparisons of results between the two approaches. Upon that, the CAE analytical tools are deployed in a sensitivity study to quantify the crush/crash character- istics of foam-filled hat-section components with respect to the changes in the aforementioned design variables. Design charts are presented, from which design variables can be selected for particular applications in order to establish the weight effectiveness of foam reinforcement. In the foam thickness range investigated (5-8 mm), the axially absorbed energy increased between 50-125%, while the maximum axial strength increased by 10-25% only. On the other hand, the flexural energy absorption increased from 10-40%, while the maxi- mum bending load registered an increase ranging from 25 to 80%. Therefore, the use of thin gages accompanied by foam layers in the 5 to 8 mm range would result in the most efficient energy-absorbing axial structural components. In addition, maximum bending strength can also be increased with almost no weight penalty, by deploying similar thicknesses of the epoxy-based foam in beam components. The cut-off gages for the efficiency of the epoxy-based foam (in the studied foam thickness layers of 5-8 mm) ranges from 1.4-1.8 mm for flexural applications and from 2.0-2.2 mm for axial applications. The enhancements in the structural characteristics of columns and beams through structural foam deployment, is due to a delayed local buckling mechanism. On the other hand, foam deployment in beams has to be enhanced in density and location, where plastic hinges are likely to form. This enhancement in location will mini- mize the total weight of the component thus maximizing the total specific energy gain per that member. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0474. (SP- 1596) Methodology on the testing of the automobile mount dynamic response. Yijung Chen, Xiaodong Zhang, Tau Ty an, and Omar Faruque, Ford Motor Co. This paper reports the latest development of methodologies for testing and CAE modeling of the automobile mounts. The objective of this study is to provide dynamic mount properties for product evaluation and CAE modeling guideline for crashworthiness simu- lations. The methodology is divided into component, subsystem and full system levels. The study at the component level is to extract the dynamic parameters of mounts, such as stiffness and damping coef- ficient, based on the component tests. Furthermore, such parameters are employed to investigate the interaction between mount and con- necting structures at the subsystem level. A robust connection mech- anism from mount to surrounding structures is also developed dur- ing this process. Finally, the results from full vehicle system tests are compared with the CAE simulations to verify the methodology at the component and subsystem levels. A robust component test methodology is the first key element of this study. This paper mainly focuses on the development of a uni- versal test fixture with required instrumentations to achieve acquisi- tion of accurate data from which the mount dynamic properties are identified, and processed. Extracted results are then reduced to appropriate input formats for CAE modeling. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0475. (SP- 1596) Test method for simulating vehicle rollover. Mike Rossey, Autoliv North America. The on-going industry effort to improve occupant safety during a rollover event has created the need to re-examine how rollover testing is conducted. The demand for a repeatable technique of test- ing vehicles and their safety systems has forced the automotive industry to create new test methods. This paper will review a non-destructive, repeatable method to test vehicle rollover susceptibility subjected to a lateral deceleration pulse. This methodology provides for efficient development of the vehicle, the rollover-sensing algorithm, and the safety system performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0476.

Curzon and Brian J. Smyth, Exponent Failure Analy- sis Associates, Inc.; and Kenneth F. Orłowski, Safety Analysis, Inc. Rollover crash and accident studies identify significant roof-to- ground impacts adjacent to the vehicle occupant as a potential cause of severe injuries. It is not possible with existing dynamic rollover test methods to specifically repeat or recreate a particular roof-to- ground impact in a controlled fashion. Variations associated with tire-to-dolly, tire/wheel-to-ground, and vehicle- to-ground interac- tions early in current rollover test methods tend to produce unpre- dictable and unrepeatable roof-to-ground impacts later in the test. A new test device now enables researchers to bypass the uncer- tainty of these first ground interactions by beginning each test with the desired roof-to-ground impact conditions as a test input.

The roll, pitch and yaw angles, translational and vertical velocities, and roll velocity of the vehicle for the first roof-to-ground interaction is repeatable from test to test. However, the subsequent vehicle dynamics are not repeat- able as the vehicle rolls to rest.

(SP- 1597) Hydraulic power steering system design and optimization simulation. Tom Wong , Delphi Saginaw Steering Systems. Hydraulic rack and pinion power steering is a high bandwidth servo with stringent performance requirements on accuracy, reliabil- ity, and cost. Design of such a system can be best achieved by using a validated and user-friendly computer simulation program. Hydrau- lic integrated power steering (HIPS) program has been developed using basic concepts from science and engineering. HIPS provides a design and test environment for the integrated steering and suspen- sion system subjected to disturbance forces, which may be induced by pump flow oscillations and tire loads. Two real- world automo- tive hydraulic steering systems are simulated with HIPS. The simu- lation results agree closely with the dynamometer test results. The application of HIPS for design optimization is also demonstrated. 2001-01-0480. (SP- 1597) Design of lane-keeping control with steering torque input for a lane-keeping support system. Masayasu Shimakage, Hiroshi Kawazoe, On Sadano, and Takuya Murakami, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes the method used to design the basic control algorithm of a lane-keeping support system that is intended to assist the driver's steering action. Lane-keeping control has been designed with steering torque as the control input without providing a minor loop for the steering angle. This approach was taken in order to achieve an optimum balance of lane-keeping control, ease of steer- ing intervention by the driver and robustness. The servo control sys- tem was designed on the basis of H2 control theory. Robustness against disturbances, vehicle nonlinearity and parameter variation was confirmed by j 1 analysis. The results of computer simulations and driving tests have confirmed that the control system designed with this method provides the intended performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0481.

(SP- 1597) The effects of front suspension parameters on road wheel toe dynamics. Dexin Wang and Yuting Rui, Ford Motor Co. Front road wheel toe dynamics directly affects tire wear and steering wheel vibration, which in turn negatively impacts customer satisfaction. Though static toe can be preset in assembly plants, the front road wheels can vibrate around steering axes or kingpin axes due to tire mass unbalance and nonuniformity. The frequency of the vibration depends on the wheel size and vehicle speed, while the amplitude of the vibration is not only dictated by the tire forces, but also by suspension and steering parameters. This paper presents a study on the sensitivities of the front road wheel toe dynamics to the parameters of a short-long-arm suspension (SLA) and a parallelo- gram steering system. These parameters includes hard point shift, steering gear compliance, gear friction, control arm bushing rates, friction in control arm ball joints, and compliance in tie rod outboard joints. The simulations were performed using the multibody dynam- ics analysis package ADAMS, while the tests were conducted on a chassis roll. The simulation and test results are well correlated, showing the effects of the friction and compliance parameters on the toe angle amplitude. The study provides valuable information in developing design strategies for minimizing the toe vibration caused by the tire imperfection. 2001-01-0483. (SP- 1597) An Advanced Electrical Power Steering Motor. Toshinori Tanaka, Akihiro Daikoku, Akihiko Imagi, and Yoshio Yoshikuwa, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. Recently, EPS (Electrical Power Steering) is being widely applied in order to reduce fuel consumption and decrease installa- tion problems of the power steering system. EPS also decreases development time and cost of the steering system due to its ease of tuning. As we mentioned in the former paper "2000-01-0824," the larger output motors are required. Upon developing the higher output motors, Mitsubishi realized that the EPS Systems brought about high acoustic noise, vibration, large torque ripple and friction loss. We have developed a very silent motor based on our unique tech- nology. This involved a very unique electromagnetic force and mechanical vibration analysis method. Our super silent motor is so quiet, that the occupants of a vehicle can not distinguish the motor noise even when the motor is installed in the vehicle cabin. 2001-01-0484. (SP- 1597) A new electric current control strat- egy for EPS motors. Masahiko Kurishige, Kouji Fukusumi, Nori- yuki Inoue, Takayuk Kifuku, and Shigeki Otagaki, Mitsubishi Elec- tric Corp. This paper presents a new motor current control strategy for Electric Power Steering (EPS) to reduce current fluctuation. Such current fluctuation may cause undesirable steering torque ripple and acoustic noise, if an inexpensive microprocessor is used. Using a DC-motor, current fluctuation associated with change in the battery voltage, etc., may occur. We have developed a new current control strategy which effectively alleviates current fluctuations of the motor without using higher performance microprocessors. The new controller is based on the estimation of disturbance voltage and compensation for this disturbance voltage. We have bench-tested the performance of this control strategy and confirmed that current fluctuation is reduced below that using conventional PI controller. The PI gain for the proposed controller is the same as that for the conventional controller. Hence, no higher performance processor is necessary because no increased sampling time for the controller is required. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0485.

Mathematical modeling of the mesh friction of a rack and pinion system has been carried out in order to predict the mesh friction of a steering gear. The three dimensional gear geometry and force dia- gram of a rack and pinion gear is represented in vector form. With proper boundary conditions applied to the equations, the mathemati- cal model simulates the friction forces resulting from the mesh. An experimental apparatus was also built to measure mesh fric- tion between a rack and pinion. A number of rack and pinion steer- ing gears have been tested under several load conditions.

Tsugiharu Matsunaga, Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Labs., Inc.; and Toshiyuki Tanaka and Shinji Nishi- mura, Toyoda Machine Works , Ltd. A mathematical model for a hydraulic power steering system was constructed and numerical analysis was performed for self-excited vibration caused by rapid steering in the power steering system. From the examination, the guide of the prevention against the vibra- tion was derived, such as positioning the rather long hose at near the power steering gear in the supply line, and the mechanism of the prevention was clarified. Moreover, the mathematical model and the guide of the prevention were verified by bench tests. 2001-01-0490. Front wheel vibrations: A hydraulic point of view - Models and first results. MarcAlirand, Michel Lebrun , and Claude William Richards, IMAGINE. Even if the brake judder is an often analyzed problem from the mechanical point of view, its influence on the hydraulic elements such as the braking and steering systems is not fully established. The aim of this paper is to present models of the hydraulic components connected to a model of the front suspension and thus having a view of the influence of these hydraulic elements on the amplification of the brake judder vibrations. Each models of the front suspension, the braking circuit and the hydraulically powered steering assistance are validated separately versus or measurements or other softwares. The introduction of the disc thickness variation (DTV) generates the braking judder of interest. Some first simulation results are shown to see couplings or influence of hydraulic components on vibration propagations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0491. (SP- 1597) Kinematics and compliance of sports utility vehicles. Peter Holdmann and Frank Berger, ZF LEMFÖRDER Fahrwerktechnik AG &amp; Co. KG. For concept and design of modern suspension systems many dif- ferent demands have to be considered. Beside package and light- weight construction especially the real scopes of a suspension sys- tem, kinematics and compliance, are getting more and more impor- tant to fulfill all technical needs coming from the automotive mar- ket. In particular the development of suspension systems for Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) has to satisfy very high demands and strong characteristics criteria coming from the On-Road and Off-Road driving. As many different load cases have to be taken into account, an analytic approach can only be used for first concept steps to design a SUV-suspension system. After that it is necessary to verify and tune all suspension and bushing characteristics by the use of multi- body simulation tools like, e. g., ADAMS. Therefore adequate mod- els of all suspension components have to be available. In this paper the main kinematics and compliance effects for an independent SUV suspension system will be explained and illus- trated: Explanation of different load cases coming from the individ- ual purposes of a Sports Utility Vehicle, Off-Road and On-Road; Illustration of the K&amp;C influences coming from the use of active systems to control roll and pitch angles or the individual wheel loads; Development of an analytic approach to solve the kinematic and compliance needs; Simulation description and results to verify the suspension design; Analysis of vibration problems resulting from current suspension system concepts. 2001-01-0492.

The University of Texas Center for Electro-mechanics (UT- CEM) has been developing active suspension technology for high- speed off-road applications since 1993. The UT-CEM system uses controlled electromechanical actuators to control vehicle dynamics with passive springs to support vehicle static weight. The program is currently in a full vehicle demonstration phase on a military high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV). This paper presents detailed test results for this demonstration vehicle, com- pared to the conventional passive HMMWV, in a series of tests con- ducted by the U.S. Army at Yuma Proving Grounds. Extensive data in plotted form are discussed, including accelerometer readings from 6 vehicle-mounted accelerometers, corner displacement trans- ducers, and current and power plots for the actuators. Results indi- cate significant mobility improvements offered by the UT-CEM system, including over five-fold reductions in driver absorbed power (a measure of driver vertical acceleration loading) and a more than 100% increase in cross-country ride-limiting speed. 2001-01-0494.

The method creates a body model based on the charac- teristics extracted by modal analysis of the results of a vibration test- ing of an actual vehicle.

(SP- 1597) NC control point estimator for shape-controlled coil spring. Shinichi Nishizawa, Maiko Ikeda, Hideto Enomoto, and Naoshi Sato, NHK International Corp.; Jiro Oy ama, NHK-Associated Spring Suspension Components, Inc.; and Toshio Hamano, NHK Spring Co, Ltd. Friction caused by side force on a damper axis results in riding discomfort. In order to cancel the side force, accurate shape control for coil springs have been recently become crucial. After designing a target coil shape using a finite element analysis (FEA), actual coil- ing processes can be done by a NC coiling machine(C/M). The prob- lem with this method is that the NC coiling machine has its own characteristics which coiling experts have to consider when adjust- ments are made to the control points of the NC machine. This adjust- ment process usually takes significant amounts of time in order to meet the target coil shape, because the coiling experts do their adjustments by a conventional method based on their experience. This paper describes how to automate the control point design process to reduce the coiling effort and to save time. An ARMA model is used for the coiling machine modeling and its dimensions are determined by the physical dimension of the actual coiling machine. Our own algorithm based on a linear descent method for control point adjustment is then proposed in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0496.

Akihiko Kumagai, California State University, Sacramento; Shinichi Nishizawa, Maiko Ikeda, Toru Tom Sugi- yama, Hideto Enomoto, and Naoshi Sato, NHK International Corp.; and Toshio Hamano, NHK Spring Co, Ltd. Traditionally coil springs were used for applications to exert one- dimensional force along a given spring coil axis. However, in recent years, there has been an increasing trend in using coil springs to pro- vide forces in a multi-dimensional space. In this paper, an approach to construct a model of a coil spring for suspension systems using a spatial six degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism is presented. In kinematics and dynamics simulation, the use of a parallel mecha- nism to model a coil spring allows a designer to simulate six degrees of freedom spring characteristics with vehicle kinematics without using FEA feature embedded in the simulation software. This requires a significant amount of computational load and maybe a file 68</page><page sequence="68">200 1 -0 1 -0496-200 1 -0 1 -0502 format converter. If an actual parallel mechanism is available and inserted into an experimental suspension system in place of a coil spring, it can be used as a device to generate various forces and torques between the upper and lower spring seats to study desirable characteristics useful for designing coil springs.

(SP- 1597) Development of L-shape coil spring to reduce a friction on the McPherson strut suspension system. Toshio Hamano and Takahiro Nakamura, NHK Spring Co, Ltd.; and Hideto Enomoto, Naoshi Sato, Shinichi Nishizawa, and Maiko Ikeda, NHK International Corp. As for the McPherson strut, a force from the tire acts on the shock absorber producing a bending moment, which causes an increase in the friction acting on the shock absorber. Reducing the friction is one of the most important issues to improve the riding comfort of an automobile. The bending moment can be reduced by controlling the load axis of the coil spring assembled with the shock absorber. In order to control the load axis, several types of coil springs have been recently reported. This paper proposes another shape-controlled coil spring, called L-shape. The L-shape spring has the following advantages: (1) The load axis can be precisely controlled with ease; (2) Additional space is unnecessary; (3) Manufacturing tractability is increased. The pro- posed L-shape spring is validated analytically and experimentally in this paper. The effect of the L-shape spring for reducing the fric- tion on a shock absorber is also experimentally confirmed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0498. (SP- 1597) Prediction of suspension fundamen- tal mode frequency with extraction of dynamic properties of automotive shock absorbers and tire. Seung-Kab Jeong and Jin- Kawn Suh, Hyundai Motor Co. The automotive shock absorber has various functions in car per- formance. Particularly, it is a dominant tuning parameter to get good primary and secondary ride characteristics within l-35Hz ranges in car development. Thus, understanding of characteristics of shock absorber in this frequency range is indispensable to both test and analysis engineers for an effective and systematic approach. In this study, tire is also investigated from the same point of view. Fre- quency dependent stiffness and damping coefficient are extracted by discrete sine swept test under constant velocity of 25, 50, 100mm/ sec which represent typical road surface conditions. The responses are analyzed on frequency domain and the basic theoretical back- ground for this approach is introduced. Also, frequency dependent stiffness and damping coefficient of the shock absorber and tire are interpolated by 1st or 2nd order function of frequency and used for prediction of fundamental suspension mode frequency with simple calculation. The results of this calculation are compared with test results to verify its usefulness. 2001-01-0499.

Prior theoretical work relating barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) and change in vehicle velocity, gDV, has either neglected restitution or mischaracterized its role. Based on fundamental structural dynamics principles, improved relationships between BEV, AV, coefficient of restitution, and vehicle mass and stiffness are formu- lated. These corrected relationships are then utilized in the assess- ment of four classes of vehicular impact testing: vehicle to vehicle (VTV), vehicle to infinitely massive rigid barrier (VRB), vehicle to infinitely massive compliant barrier (VCB) and vehicle to finite mass movable rigid barrier (VFMB). 2001-01-0500. (SP- 1572) Stiffness and crush energy analysis for vehicle collision and its relationship to Barrier Equivalent Velocity (BEV). Nicholas J. Carpenter, Collision Dynamics Analy- sis; and Judson B. Welcher, Biomechanical Research &amp; Testing, LLC. Accident reconstruction typically requires estimating the change of velocity (Delta- V) imparted to vehicles during collision. Estimat- ing Delta-V commonly involves measuring or estimating the defor- mation of the vehicles involved in a collision. Material coefficients, which relate barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) to deformation for the two vehicles, are then interpolated or extrapolated from barrier crash test data. Finally, the Delta-V for each of the two vehicles is usually calculated using single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) impact mechanics formulas. This paper presents a derivation of SDOF impact mechanics for- mulas applicable to one-dimensional vehicle collisions. The govern- ing equations presented are new, more complete and more efficient than previously published efforts. In particular, Newton's third law of physics concerning collision force is proportionally expressed as the product of vehicle weight, crush progression behavior and BEV. Relative closing speed and Delta-V are then related to BEV by a fac- tor that is efficiently a function of relative vehicle weight and rela- tive crush progression behavior. The mechanics derivations reveal the proper relationship for predicting coefficient of restitution for vehicle-to-vehicle collision. Previous literature has assumed that restitution can depend on relative vehicle weight. It is shown that the prediction of restitution depends strictly on relative vehicle stiff- ness, not relative weight. 2001-01-0501. (SP- 1572) Determination of bi coefficients from lower and higher speed impacts using peak force. Peter M. Burkhard, Burkhard Analysis and Methods Corp. There is considerable published vehicular crash data, with much of the testing being associated with higher impact severities. Crash coefficients derived from these impact tests have been utilized by accident reconstructionists to simulate the behavior of vehicles in other situations. However, the suitability of these coefficients for the analysis of lower severity collisions has not been determined. The use of rigid, massive barrier impact testing can provide a measure of the bi coefficient and stiffness for that particular vehicle. In addi- tion, if the effective bi coefficient for a vehicle is known, the effec- tive bi coefficient of a second vehicle can be determined from vehi- cle to vehicle impact testing. Measurement of peak force at a given closing velocity during a collision yields the system natural frequency. If the vehicle is impacted into a rigid, massive barrier, the measured peak force will directly yield the natural frequency and the effective bi coefficient for that particular vehicle. Crash test data, extracted from the published technical literature as well as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) database, is examined for a limited set of vehicles in both the lower and higher severity impact regimes. Comparisons between the bi coefficients derived in the lower and higher severity impact regimes are made for a given vehicle. A striking phenomenon is noted from this limited set of vehicles. Namely, the effective bi coefficient determined from peak force measurements at lower impact severities is very similar in magnitude to the bi coefficients derived from higher speed impact severity testing using both a Campbell model approximation and peak forces, for a given vehicle. The use of bi coefficients derived from higher severity impacts could be instrumental in the determination of collision forces and changes in vehicle speed in lower and moderate severity impacts, where minimal, if any, permanent crush is developed. 2001-01-0502. (SP- 1572) Stiffness parameters for vehicle col- lision analysis, an update. Gustav A. Nystrom, Amador Newtonian Engineering. 69</page><page sequence="69">2001-01-0502-2001-01-0508 At the 1991 SAE Congress, a paper entitled "Stiffness Parame- ters for Vehicle Collision Analysis" was published. The section that attracted the most interest dealt with various methods to relate the CRASH stiffness parameters (A and B) to the SMAC stiffness parameter (KV). The discussion immediately following the paper presentation revealed one more method (developed by Fonda) to relate the CRASH and SMAC parameters consistently with regards to crash energy. These last ten years there have been three significant develop- ments concerning a consistent CRASH-SMAC conversion. Firstly, a greater range of software providers has developed more variations of each basic computer program. Secondly, the CRASH algorithm has been extended so that it treats rebound more like the old SMAC. And thirdly, two completely different versions of SMAC have been released which provide for a bilinear force-displacement curve like the old CRASH. The lack of clarity regarding the various crash algo- rithms became evident during the 2000 SAE Congress, when a paper was presented which concluded that to achieve consistent results for a crash between two vehicles, the CRASH "A" values for the two vehicles needed to be the same. This paper re-visits the question of how to relate CRASH to SMAC calculations. Because the crash algorithms have become more complicated, the re-visit employs numerical integrations, which were not required for the paper ten years ago. The calculated results clearly show under what conditions the various CRASH and SMAC algorithms will yield consistent results for frontal in-line col- lisions. A new set of force-crush relations based upon elastic-plastic the- ory is introduced. Compared to previously published force-crush relations, the new one is found to be simpler, easier to handle numer- ically, and lead to somewhat more realistic crash pulses. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0503. (SP- 1572) SIMON: A new vehicle simulation model for vehicle design and safety research. Terry D. Day and Sydney G. Roberts , Engineering Dynamics Corp.; and Allen R. York , A.R. York Engineering. SIMON is a new vehicle dynamic simulation model. Applica- tions for SIMON include single- or multi-unit vehicle handling sim- ulation in severe limit maneuvers (including rollovers) and 3-dimen- sional environments. Applications also include vehicle-to- vehicle and vehicle-to-barrier collisions. This paper provides the technical background for the SIMON engineering model. The 3-dimensional equations of motion used by the model are presented and explained in detail. The calculations for suspension, tire, collision, aerody- namic and inter-vehicle connection forces and moments are also developed. The integration of features available in the HVE Simula- tion Environment, such as DyMESH, the Driver Model, Brake Designer and Steer Degree of Freedom, is also explained. Finally, assumptions and limitations of the model are presented. 2001-01-0504. (SP- 1572) Non-linear damage analysis in acci- dent reconstruction. Ronald L. Woolley, Woolley Engineering Research Corp. Frontal, side, rear, pole and offset car-to-car data sets are exam- ined using familiar damage analysis models: constant stiffness, bilinear stiffness, and force saturation. In addition to these, a non- linear power-law formulation is introduced and compared to the oth- ers. The power-law provides a nonlinear stiffness coefficient that transitions between a constant force model and constant stiffness model as the power goes from 0 to 1 . It also provides a continuous, single valued function that is easily integrated and used in the analy- sis. Power-law non-linearity can be used to smoothly fit low through high crush data. Geometric integral parameters are developed which represent irregular crush profiles. These permit graphical comparison of tests with non-uniform crush data (such as offset, side, and narrow object) with uniform crush test data. They also provide a means for comparison of accident damage with the test data set. Force-deflection data supplements energy-residual crush data to define non-linear crush stiffness coefficients for accident recon- struction damage analysis. Improved modeling results for both low crush levels and for extrapolation to damage profiles well beyond the test data level. Load cell barrier data is provided in some NCAP frontal barrier tests in the NHTSA database. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0505. (SP- 1572) PC-Crash and HVE, an overview of similarities and differences. Richard Fay , Rie Robině tt e, John Scott , and Patrick Fay , Fay Engineering Corp. HVE and PC-Crash have been the subject of numerous SAE papers. Both programs have been offered to reconstructionists for the purpose of analyzing vehicle accidents and presenting the result- ing motions in 3D graphical form. This paper will give an overview of the theoretical basis for the two computerized accident reconstruction and simulation tools, the user interfaces, the way they present the results, and how they com- pare in the analysis of different types of accidents. 2001-01-0507. (SP- 1572) Reconstruction of twenty staged col- lisions with PC-Crash's optimizer. William E. Cliff, Maclnnis Engineering Associates (MEA); and Andreas Moser, Dr. Steffan Datentechnik (DSD). When vehicle collisions are reconstructed using a discrete kinetic time forward simulation program, many trials have to be performed to reach a point where the simulation results are close to the actual ones. The pre-impact speeds and directions of travel of each vehicle are the main variables that affect the post-impact motion of the vehi- cles. However, other factors, such as the exact resultant position where the impact forces are exchanged, the vehicle positions with respect to each other at impact, and the coefficient of restitution are important variables that also affect the results. When a number of impact parameters are unknown, a reconstruction can take a great deal of time. An optimizer tool in PC-Crash is designed to minimize recon- struction time and error by automatically varying a selected number of impact parameters, comparing the resulting simulation for each combination of parameters with the actual incident. For each simu- lation, it calculates a weighted total error that is based on differences between the actual vehicle positions and angles and those obtained in the simulation. In each subsequent simulation, it changes values in an attempt to minimize the weighted total error. Hundreds of dif- ferent combinations can be compared in a few minutes. Twenty staged collisions were reconstructed with the optimizer tool in PC-Crash. These staged collisions had been previously reconstructed with a combination of manual linear momentum cal- culations combined with the trajectory model in an earlier version of PC-Crash. Differences between the reconstruction simulations and the actual collisions, and methods for minimizing reconstruction errors, are discussed. 2001-01-0508. (SP-1581) NOx adsorber desulfurization under conditions compatible with diesel applications. Michel Molinier, ASEC Manufacturing. One of the main drawbacks of the NOx adsorber technology ver- sus the other leading approach for high level NOx conversion, namely selective catalytic reduction, is its high sensitivity to sulfur. In spite of the likely availability of ultra-low sulfur fuel and protect- ing devices like sulfur traps, and furthermore taking into consider- ation additional sulfur sources such as engine oil and lubricants, a desulfurization strategy will be essential to the commercial imple- mentation of NOx adsorber catalysts on diesel vehicles. The results presented in this paper were obtained on NOx adsorbers with proven thermal durability and efficiency in diesel engine exhaust. They show NOx performance recovery following severe sulfur poisoning, after desulfation under temperature and air/fuel mixture conditions compatible with diesel engine operation. In addition, different desulfurization tactics, tested on a synthetic gas bench simulating diesel exhaust, are depicted and discussed. 70</page><page sequence="70">200 1 -0 1 -05 1 0-200 1 -0 1 -05 1 3 2001-01-0510. (SP-1581) Development of a desulfurization strategy for a NOx adsorber catalyst system. Sam Geckler and Dean Tomazic, FEV Engine Technology , Inc.; Volker Scholz , FEV Motorentechnik GmbH; Margaret V. Whalen, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Dale McKinnon, MECA; John Orban, Battelle ; Robert A. Gorse , Ford Motor Co.; Owen Bailey, ASEC; and James C. Hoelzer, Detroit Diesel. The aggressive reduction of future diesel engine NOx emission limits forces the heavy- and light-duty diesel engine manufacturers to develop means to comply with stringent legislation. As a result, different exhaust emission control technologies applicable to NOx have been the subject of many investigations. One of these systems is the NOx adsorber catalyst, which has shown high NOx conversion rates during previous investigations with acceptable fuel consump- tion penalties. In addition, the NOx adsorber catalyst does not require a secondary on-board reductant. However, the NOx adsorber catalyst also represents the most sul- fur sensitive emissions control device currently under investigation for advanced NOx control. To remove the sulfur introduced into the system through the diesel fuel and stored on the catalyst sites during operation, specific regeneration strategies and boundary conditions were investigated and developed. To achieve the required exhaust temperature under slightly rich conditions, a pre-catalyst may be required. Under constant engine operating conditions, the duration of the desulfurization process was varied to determine the required desulfurization period. In addition, the catalysts were aged and peri- odically desulfurized to determine the influence of multiple desul- furization events on long-term catalyst performance. The test results show that using a pre-catalyst, the NOx conver- sion capability of a NOx adsorber catalyst can be restored even after multiple desulfurizations. However, a decline in conversion effi- ciency can be observed over time. In anticipation of future catalyst improvements, it can be concluded, that the adsorber catalyst is a promising technology for future vehicle applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0511. (SP-1581) Performance and durability evalua- tion of continuously regenerating particulate Alters on diesel- powered urban buses at NY city transit. Thomas Lanni, New York State; Sougato Chatterjee, Ray Conway, and Hassan Windawi, Johnson Matthey CSD; Deborah Rosenblatt, Environment Canada; Christopher Bush and Dana Lowell, NY City Transit; James Evans, Equilon Enterprises LLC; and Robert McLean, Corning Inc. Particulate emission from diesel engines is one of the most important pollutants in urban areas. As a result, particulate emission control from urban bus diesel engines using particle filter technol- ogy is being evaluated at several locations in the US. A project enti- tled "Clean Diesel Demonstration Program" has been initiated by NY City Transit under the supervision of NY State DEC and with active participation from several industrial partners. Under this program, several NY city transit buses with DDC Series 50 engines have been equipped with continuously regenerat- ing diesel particulate filter system and are operating with ultra low sulfur diesel (&lt;30 ppm S) in transit service in Manhattan since Feb- ruary 2000. These buses are being evaluated over a 8-9 month period for operations, maintainability and durability of the particu- late filter. In addition, an extensive emissions testing program is being carried out under transient cycles on a chassis dyno to evalu- ate the emissions reductions obtained with the particle filter. The on-road operational data over eight months showed stable exhaust back pressure with the particle filters, indicating successful filter regeneration. No adverse operational or maintenance issues were observed which can be attributed to the filter system. The emissions results from the first phase of testing exhibited &gt;90% reductions in CO, HC and PM with the particulate filter. In addition, &gt;99% reductions in Carbonyls and up to 80% PAH and 94% NO2-PAH destructions were also achieved. In this paper, the operational and emissions testing data from the NY City Clean Diesel Demonstration Program are discussed in detail. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0512. (SP-1581) Emission reductions and opera- tional experiences with heavy-duty diesel fleet vehicles retrofit- ted with continuously regenerated diesel particulate filters in Southern California. Sougato Chatterjee, Carl McDonald, Ray Conway, and Hassan Windawi, Johnson Matthey; Keith Vertin, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Chuck A. LeTavec, BP; and Nigel N. Clark, and Mridul Gautam, West Virginia Univ. Particulate emission control from diesel engines is one of the major concerns in the urban areas in California. Recently, regula- tions have been proposed for stringent PM emission requirements from both existing and new diesel engines. As a result, particulate emission control from urban diesel engines using advanced particu- late filter technology is being evaluated at several locations in Cali- fornia. Although ceramic-based particle filters are well known for high PM reductions, the lack of effective and durable regeneration sys- tem has limited their applications. The continuously regenerated diesel particulate filter (CRDPF) technology discussed in this pre- sentation, solves this problem by catalytically oxidizing NO present in the diesel exhaust to NO2 which is utilized to continuously com- bust the engine soot under the typical diesel engine operating condi- tion. A one-year technology validation program is being run on vehi- cles from several diesel engine fleets in Southern California to eval- uate emissions reductions using this CRDPF system and ultra-low- sulfur diesel fuel. Under this program, vehicles such as fuel tanker trucks, school buses, sanitation trucks, grocery trucks and transit buses have been retrofitted with CRDPFs and are being operated with ultra-low-sulfur diesel. The program was started in September 1999. As a part of the program, these retrofitted vehicles are being evaluated for on-road operation and emissions reductions. In addi- tion to drivability and maintenance, the on-road exhaust back pres- sure and temperature with the CRDPFs are being monitored to eval- uate successful operation. The emissions testing program involves chassis dyno testing of several vehicles from each fleet to examine the emissions reductions due to the use of ultra low sulfur diesel and the installation of continuously regenerated particle filters. To date, the results indicate very successful operation of all the vehicles retrofitted with the catalytically regenerated particulate fil- ters. Initial emissions testing show &gt;90% reductions in PM, HC and CO, compared to C ARB -fueled vehicles with no particulate filter. Particle sizing analysis also indicates &gt;99% reduction in particle count with the CRDPF. 2001-01-0513. (SP-1581) Maximizing the effectiveness of water-blended fuel in reducing emissions by varying injection timing or using after-treatment device. Deborah A. Langer, Nich- olas K. Petek, and Elizabeth A. Schiferl, Lubrizol Corp. Water-emulsified diesel fuel technology has been proven to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) simulta- neously at relatively low cost compared to other pollution-reducing strategies. While the mechanisms which result in these reductions have been postulated, the development of new analytical tools to measure in-cylinder soot formation using optically accessible engines can lead to a deeper understanding of combustion and the chemical and physical mechanisms when water is present during combustion. In this study, an optically accessible single cylinder engine was used to study how water brought into the combustion chamber via an emulsified fuel changes the combustion process and thereby reduces emissions. In-cylinder measurements of relative soot concentrations were used to determine the effect of water- emulsified fuel on soot formation. Results of this experiment show that the water not only physically changes the way combustion occurs, but more importantly, modifies the chemical kinetics of the 71</page><page sequence="71">200 1 -0 1 -05 1 3-200 1 -0 1 -05 25 combustion process. The physical changes (i.e., temperature) lead to lower NOx levels, analogous to what happens when timing is changed. The chemical kinetics changes, however, also lead to reduced particulates independent of the temperature change. This kinetic change is robust to timing adjustments, thereby breaking the correlation between NOx reduction and PM increase that typically occurs when engine adjustments are made to reduce emissions. To further understand these process changes, emulsified fuels with varying water levels (0 to 20%) were evaluated in a multi- cylinder marine engine using three different timing of injections. This testing in an actual engine confirms that as the water level is increased the amount of NOx and PM are reduced without compro- mising engine performance. Furthermore, changing the timing of injection can be done in conjunction with using an emulsified fuel to further optimize the engine performance and decrease emissions. In addition to engine optimization, water emulsified fuel in combi- nation with a DOC was tested and was shown to reduce particulate emissions greater than each technology separately and nearing the level typically offered with a diesel particulate trap. 2001-01-0514.

Crocker , dmc2. The LEV II and EURO V legislation in 2007/2008 require a high conversion level for nitrogen oxides to meet the emission levels for diesel SUVs and trucks. Therefore, U.S. and European truck manu- facturers are considering the introduction of urea SCR systems no later than model year 2005. The current SCR catalysts are based mainly on systems derived from stationary power plant applications. Therefore, improved washcoat-based monolith catalysts were devel- oped using standard types of formulations. These catalysts achieved high conversion levels similar to extruded systems in passenger car and truck test cycles. However, to meet further tightening of stan- dards, a new class of catalysts was developed. These advanced type of catalytic coatings proved to be equivalent or even better than standard washcoat formulations. Results will be shown from ESC, M VEG and US -FTP 75 tests to illustrate the progress in catalyst design for urea SCR. The new catalyst systems show a very good aging performance and will be the next generation of urea SCR cata- lysts for mobile applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0515.

Calis , Delft University of Technology. A catalytic deSoot-deNOx system, comprising Pt and Ce fuel additives, a Pt-impregnated wall-flow monolith soot filter and a vanadia-type monolithic NH3 - SCR catalyst, was tested with a 2-cy linder DI diesel engine. The soot removal efficiency of the filter was 98-99% (mass), the balance temperature (stationary pressure drop) was 315°C at an engine load of 55%. The NOx emission at high loads is around 15% lower than those of engine running with- out fuel additives. The NOx conversion ranged from 40 to 73%, at a NH3/NOx ratio of 0.9, both measured at a GHSV of 52,000 1/1/h. The maximum NOx conversion was obtained at 400°C. No deactiva- tion was observed after 380 h time on stream. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0516.

As part of a California Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) sys- tem demonstration and evaluation project, the authors and their industrial partners have conducted engine dynamometer emissions tests of SCR systems. The transient Federal Test Procedure (FTP) cycle and 13 Mode European Stationary Cycle (ESC) were con- ducted using certification diesel fuel with 300-500 ppm of sulfur. This paper reviews the performance of the first system to meet the goal of attaining 1 g/bhp-hr NOx emissions in the transient FTP cycle on a 1999 DDC Series 60 engine that has an initial 4 g/bhp-hr level. This paper discusses key characteristics of a typical automo- tive SCR system and then presents the results and analysis of the engine dynamometer emission testing of a SCR system. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges involved in on-road operation of the system. 2001-01-0517. (SP-1581) Combined silencers and urea-SCR systems for heavy-duty diesel vehicles for OEM and retrofit markets. Pär Gabrielsson, Ioannis Gekas, and Peter Schoubye, Haldor Tops0e A/S; and S0ren /E Mikkelsen, and Svend Frederik- sen, Silentor A/S. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) with NH3 or urea is one of the most effective methods for removal of NOx in exhaust from HD diesel engines with potential for achieving more than 90% NOx- reduction measured in the European transient or a US HD FTP test cycle. The present paper describes the following two systems; One OEM UREA-SCR SILENCER, comprising a silencer with built-in catalyst. The system was tested on a Scania DC 1205 320 kW diesel engine, which was calibrated for the Euro II emission standard. The test results showed that it is possible to reduce more than 85% of the NOx emission with an insignificant NH3 slip in the ETC tran- sient test cycle. The pressure-drop of the system was measured at 80% of that of the engine's original silencer and the silencing per- formance was improved for low frequencies below 125 Hz. One RETROFIT UREA-SCR SYSTEM for HD engines, comprising a silencer with built-in catalyst, an electronic urea injection control system, urea injection and a urea tank. The importance of injection strategy and the relation between urea/NOx ratio, ammonia slip and obtained NOx-removal was elucidated by transient tests with a 10- liter 190 kW Volvo HD excavator engine on test rig. NOx removals of 77 to 88% were demonstrated in ETC and the European ISO 8178C1 off-road test cycles with essentially no ammonia slip. 99.7% NOx reduction was obtained with a high NH3-slip of about 100 ppm, illustrating the potential of the urea SCR technology. The silencer contained 29-liter catalyst. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0519. (SP-1581) Development of urea-SCR system for light-duty diesel passenger car. Sung-mu Choi, Young-kee Yoon, Seok-jae Kim, and Gwon-koo Yeo, Hyundai Motor Co.; and Hyun-sik Han, Heesung Engelhard Corp. Urea-SCR system consisted of combined deNOx catalysts with wide range of temperature window, injector, sensor and injection controller. Synthetic gas activity test and NOx conversion efficiency test on the engine bench were carried out to evaluate and improve the performance of this system. To better suit the application of the urea-SCR system without engine modification, temperature of cata- lyst and engine RPM were used as input data to control amounts of urea aqueous solution that reacts with NOx. We concentrated on designing types of deNOx catalysts and controlling amounts of urea solution under different driving conditions to achieve higher NOx reduction and wider temperature window. Designed urea-SCR sys- tem showed substantial NOx reduction performance and relatively wide temperature window under different driving conditions. 2001-01-0525.

(SP-1583) Influence of pre- and post-injection on the performance and pollutant emissions in a HD diesel engine. Jesús Benajes , Santiago Molina , and José M. García , Universidad Polit, cnica de Valencia. The work presented here focuses on the influence of pre- and post-injection on the development of the combustion process and on engine efficiency and pollutant emissions. Tests were performed with a heavy-duty 1.8-liter single-cylinder engine. The study combines performance and emissions measure- ments together with heat release law analysis. Four representative operating conditions from the European Steady-state test Cycle (ESC) have been considered. For each one, the fuel quantity of the pre- and post-injection has been varied between 12 and 20 mg/cc, and the delay of the pre- and post-injection respect to the main injec- tion has been modified too. With a pre-injection strategy it has been possible to reduce the fuel consumption with little soot penalty but causing an increase in NOx levels in most engine modes. The post- injection strategy has been demonstrated to be efficient in soot reduction without NOx emission and fuel consumption penalty. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0527. Measurement of the rate of multiple fuel injec- tion with diesel fuel and DME. Tadashi Ikeda, Yukimitsu Ohmori, and Akio Takamura, ONO SOKKI Co., Ltd.; Yoshio Sato, Traffic Safety and Nuisance Research Institute; Li Jun, Jilin University of Technology; and Takeyuki Kamimoto, Tokai Univ. The accuracy of the injection rate meter based on W. Zeuch' s method in the measurement of multiple injection rate and amount was calibrated using a small cam-driven piston that is driven by an electric motor. For the pre- or early-injection, a sensor with a high sensitivity can be applied to measure the small pressure increase due to the small injection amount. In case of the multiple injection that has the post and/or late injection, a pressure sensor with a low sensi- tivity must cover not only the large pressure increase due to the main injection but also the small pressure increase due to the post and/or late injection because the output of the high sensitivity sensor is sat- urated after the main injection. So the linearity of the low sensitivity pressure sensor was calibrated with the cam-driven piston prior to the experiment with the actual injection system. Then the measure- ment of the rate of multiple fuel injection was made successfully up to 3 stages per cycle and the reliability of the system developed was demonstrated. The injection rate meter is also applied to the measurement of the injection rate of DME that is regarded as one of the future alternative fuels for Diesel engines. As its material characteristics such as boil- ing temperature or bulk modulus of elasticity of volume are different from the conventional diesel fuel, the dimensions of measuring sys- tem may have to be modified appropriately to achieve the reliable results. Some of the results of the preliminary test to measure multi- ple injection with a common-rail injection system using DME are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0528. (SP-1583) Development of micro-diesel injec- tor nozzles via MEMS technology and effects on spray charac- teristics. S. Baik, J. Blanchard, and M. Corradini, University of Wisconsin. Micro-machined planar orifice nozzles have been developed and used with commercially produced diesel injection systems. Such a system may have the capability to improve the spray characteristics in DI diesel engines. The availability of a MEMS (Micro-Electro- Mechanical-Systems) processing sequence supported the construc- tion of micro-planar orifice nozzles, and micro-systems technology was also employed in our macro-instrumentation. To demonstrate this process, fourteen MEMS nozzles were fabri- cated with deep X-ray lithography and electroplating technology. The circular orifice diameters were varied from 40 to 260 microns and the number of orifices varied from one to 169. Three plates with non-circular orifices were also fabricated to examine the effect of orifice shape on spray characteristics. These nozzles were then attached to commercial injectors and the associated injection sys- tems were used for the spray experiments. Given these novel injec- tion systems, jet spray characteristics of micro-machined nozzles were investigated experimentally at two different injection pres- sures. Current test results show the expected qualitative trends in spray kinematics and drop size, but the quantitative magnitudes of the behavior are less dependent on geometry than first anticipated. Specifically, high pressure data shows only modest gains with a multi-hole configuration. Non-planar configurations are expected to show improved performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0529. (SP-1583) The influence of injector parameters on the formation and break-up of a diesel spray. R. Morgan and J. Wray, Ricardo ; and D. A. Kennaird, C. Crua, and M. R. Heikal, University of Brighton. The influences of injector nozzle geometry, injection pressure and ambient air conditions on a diesel fuel spray were examined using back-lighting techniques. Both stills and high-speed imaging techniques were used. Operating conditions representative of a mod- ern turbocharged aftercooled HSDI diesel engine were achieved in an optical rapid compression machine fitted with a common rail fuel injector. Qualitative differences in spray structure were observed between tests performed with short and long injection periods. Changes in the flow structure within the nozzle could be the source of this effect. The temporal liquid penetration lengths were derived from the high-speed images. Comparisons were made between different noz- zle geometries and different injection pressures. Differences were observed between VCO (Valve Covers Orifice) and mini- sac noz- zles, with the mini-sac nozzles showing a higher rate of penetration under the same conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0530. (SP-1583) Flame lift-off on direct-injection die- sel sprays under quiescent conditions. Dennis Siebers and Brian Higgins, Sandia National Laboratories. Ambient gas temperature and density, injection pressure, and ori- fice diameter effects on the flame lift-off length on a direct-injection (DI) diesel spray under quiescent conditions were experimentally investigated. The impacts of the observed lift-off length variations on air entrainment upstream of the lift-off location, soot formation, and the relationship between fuel vaporization and combustion were also examined. The research was conducted in a constant-volume combustion vessel using a common-rail fuel injector and a Phillips research grade #2 diesel fuel. The lift-off length measurements show that lift-off length decreases with increasing ambient gas temperature or density, and increases with increasing injection pressure or orifice diameter. The sensitivity of lift-off length to a change in either temperature or den- sity was non-linear, with the sensitivity to either parameter decreas- ing as it increased. The increase in lift-off length with increasing injection pressure was linearly dependent on injection velocity. Esti- mates of the air entrainment upstream of the lift-off length, show that the amount of fuel-air premixing upstream of the lift-off length is dependent on the combined effects of many of the above men- tioned parameters on air entrainment and the lift-off length. Cou- pling the air entrainment estimates with soot incandescence mea- surements indicates that there is a strong link between the fuel-air mixing upstream of the lift-off length and soot formation. Soot incandescence was observed to decrease as the amount of fuel-air 73</page><page sequence="73">2001-01-0530- 2001-01-0537 premixing upstream of the lift-off length increased, with no signifi- cant soot incandescence (i.e., no significant soot) being observed when enough air was entrained to reduce the average equivalence ratio at the lift-off length to a value less than approximately two. Finally, comparison of the lift-off lengths with previously measured liquid lengths indicates that the relationship between fuel vaporiza- tion and combustion is strongly affected by ambient gas and injector parameters. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0531. (SP- 1583) X-ray measurements of high pres- sure diesel sprays. Christopher F. Powell , Yong Yue, Ramesh Po ola, and Jin Wang , Ar gonne National Laboratory; Ming -Chia Lai , Wayne State Univ.; and Johannes Schaller, Robert Bosch GmbH. A quantitative and time-resolved technique has been developed to probe the fuel distribution very near the nozzle of a high-pressure diesel injector. This technique uses the absorption of synchrotron x-rays to measure the fuel mass with good time and position resolu- tion. The penetrating power of x-rays allows measurements that are difficult with other techniques, such as quantitative measurements of the mass and penetration measurements of the trailing edge of the spray. Line-of-sight measurements were used to determine the fuel density as a function of time. The high time resolution and quantita- tive nature of the measurement also permit an accurate measure of the instantaneous mass flow rate through the nozzle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0532. (SP-1583) Effect of gas density and the number of injector holes on the air flow surrounding non-evaporating transient diesel sprays. Dong-Ryul Rhim and Patrick V. Farrell, University of Wisconsin. The effect of ambient gas density and the number of injector holes on the characteristics of airflow surrounding non-evaporating transient diesel sprays inside a constant volume chamber were investigated using a 6-hole injector. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the gas velocities surrounding a spray plume as a function of space and time. A conical control surface surrounding the spray plume was cho- sen as a representative side entrainment surface. The positive nor- mal velocities across the control surface of single-hole injection sprays were higher than those of 6-hole injection sprays. An abrupt increase in velocities tangential to the control surface near the cham- ber wall suggests that the recirculation of surrounding gas is acceler- ated by spray wall impingement. The accumulated mass of laterally entrained gas of the single-hole injection sprays seems to be larger than that of 6-hole injection sprays mainly due to the higher positive normal velocities for the case of the single-hole injection sprays. Under the non-evaporating transient spray conditions, large differ- ences between the total spray volume and the accumulated gas vol- ume entrained laterally indicated that a significant portion of the gas entrainment into spray plume took place near the liquid spray tip, for the range of variables studied by the authors. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0533. (SP-1583) Investigation on measurement of diesel spray breakup length by using doppler signals. Katsumasa Kurachi, Takeshi Serizawa, and Kou Wada, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. ; and Satoru Kato, and Hiroshi Ito, Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Labs., Inc. New measuring methods of diesel spray characteristics were investigated by using laser doppler signals, when diesel spray was injected into a high pressure vessel at room temperature (injection under the high pressure means the simulation of injection atmo- sphere of diesel engine). We describe two methods of breakup length measurement, and these have great advantage compared with the conventional method using spray photographs. First, spray tip penetration was measured by the delay time of doppler signals from injection start to spray tip arrival at each mea- suring point (measuring volume of Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV)), traversing the measuring point along the spray axis center line or offset line of the center line from nozzle hole towards down- stream. Spray breakup length was measured as the inflection point of the curve drawing the delay time of doppler signals versus the measuring points. Each measured data of diesel spray was compared with the data estimated from spray photographs. Finally, we found that the result of this method is well agreeing with the conventional one. Second, we found that spray breakup length was estimated by measuring standard deviation of the delay time of Doppler signals which indicated spray tip arrival time, because spray tip arrival time was of uneven after spray was broken up. This measuring method about breakup length was also verified to be adequate. Moreover, while concerning the residual spray at downstream of the breakup length, we found that spray droplets number density and spray droplets number flux could be estimated by measuring the data-rate of Doppler signals. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0535. (SP- 1589) Balancing stack, air supply, and water/thermal management demands for an indirect methanol PEM fuel cell system. David J. Friedman, Anthony Eggert, P. Badrinarayanan, and Joshua Cunningham, University of Califor- nia. This work presents a method to maximize the net power output of an indirect methanol PEM fuel cell system. This method estab- lishes an operating strategy for the air supply based on the stack, air supply and water and thermal management (WTM) sub-system characteristics -holding anode conditions constant. It is shown that operating strategies based on individual components result in the inefficient operation of the overall system. Inclusion of the WTM modifies the optimal operating conditions for both low and high pressure systems. However the results for high pressure show an efficiency gain through reducing air pressure and increasing airflow, the opposite of what is expected. This work also outlines the compo- nents and issues not included and their importance in system operation. 2001-01-0536. (SP- 1589) Fuel cell auxiliary power systems: Design and cost implications. Carole J. Read, Jan H. J. S. Thijssen, and Eric J. Carlson, Arthur D. Little, Inc. In addition to high-profile fuel cell applications such as automo- tive propulsion and distributed power generation, the use of fuel cells as auxiliary power units (APU) for vehicles has received con- siderable attention. APU applications may be an attractive market because fuel cells offer some attractive features for APU applica- tions and the APU market offers a true mass-market opportunity that does not require some of the challenging performance and cost tar- gets required for propulsion systems for vehicles. In this paper we discuss the technical performance requirements for PEM and SOFC APUs, as well as the current status of the tech- nology and the implications for fuel cell system configuration and cost. 2001-01-0537.

This paper deals with the analysis of a hydrogen-air fuel cell sys- tem based on a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack. The goal of the analysis is to understand the impact of stack water and thermal management on the system both during steady state and dynamic operations. The stack level study is done in terms of liquid and water vapor flows and distribution via a detailed stack water management model. An analysis of the stack and the system level implications of varying the anode saturation temperature is per- formed. It is shown that increasing the anode saturation temperature 74</page><page sequence="74">200 1 -0 1 -05 37- 200 1 -0 1 -0544 potentially enhances stack performance but need not improve sys- tem performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0538. (SP- 1589) A comparison of high-pressure and low-pressure operation of PEM fuel cell systems. Joshua M. Cun- ningham , Myron A. Hoffman , and David J. Friedman , University of California. Equivalent PEM DHFC stack peak power values can be obtained using both high-pressure and low-pressure air supply systems. For each air supply configuration, air mass flow and pressure operating conditions can be found that result in an equal value of the oxygen partial pressure at the cathode catalyst layer surface. However, at the system level, the required air supply power needed to achieve the same DHFC stack performance values can be drastically different for high and low pressure operation. In order to compare the two systems, an optimal air supply control strategy is first developed to obtain the desired stack operating conditions with minimal parasitic loads based on each air supply configuration. Sec- ond, the resulting air supply parasitic loads are compared directly between the two configurations - both comparisons are set in the context of the system performance. In other words, the systems are sized such that the peak net power values are equal while the stack gross power may be different. The results of the study demonstrate the well-known fact that equivalent DHFC peak net system power values (86kW) can be obtained with both types of air supply configurations but require dif- ferent stack sizes. For the blower application, the stack size had to be increased by 16.3% (500 versus 430 cells in this example) for a peak net power of 86kW. Differences are also apparent with the WTM sub- system. Quantitative results will be presented for both the high pressure and the low pressure applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0539. (SP- 15 89) Steam reformer/burner integration and analysis for an indirect methanol fuel cell vehicle fuel pro- cessor. Meena Sundaresan, Sitaram Ramaswamy , and Robert M. Moore , University of California. This paper focuses on the impact of proper thermal integration between two major components of the indirect methanol fuel cell vehicle fuel processor (reformer and burner). The fuel processor uses the steam reformation of methanol to produce the hydrogen required by the fuel cell. Since the steam reformation is an endother- mic process, the required thermal energy is supplied by a catalytic burner. The performance of the fuel processor is very strongly influ- enced by the extent of thermal integration between the reformer and burner. Both components are modeled as a set of CSTRs (Continu- ous Stirred Tank Reactors) using Matlab/Simulink. The current model assumes no time lag between the methanol sent into the reformer and the methanol sent into the burner to generate the neces- sary heat for the reformer reactions to occur. However, a time lag between these flows can affect the temperature distribution of the thermally integrated components, possibly jeopardizing reformer catalyst integrity, decreasing methanol conversion and increasing carbon monoxide production. Preliminary results for a lag to a step response are discussed, and there appears to be minimal effect on this limited set of parameters. 2001-01-0540.

Sadler, A. J. Stapleton, R. P. G. Heath, and N. S. Jackson, Ricardo. If fuel cell vehicles are to compete in the same marketplace as conventional vehicles, then they must provide the consumer with the same, or improved, levels of convenience, comfort, refinement and performance at the same, or lower, price. In 2003/4, several vehicle manufacturers are planning to launch their first commercial fuel cell vehicles onto the market. In this remarkably short timeframe, many systems must be integrated into a vehicle including the fuel cell sys- tem plus thermal and water management, cabin heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, control and on-board diagnostics, power elec- tronics, electric motor and gearbox, suspension, steering, braking, refinement and crash protection. This paper presents a range of modeling techniques which allow the user to design and develop key systems, including the power management system, compressed air supply, thermal management and control algorithms. These techniques are illustrated by applica- tion to a hydrogen-fueled PEM fuel cell-powered Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) concept. 2001-01-0543. (SP-1589) The hybridized fuel cell vehicle model of the University of California, Davis. Karl-Heinz Hauer, R. M. Moore, and S. Ramaswamy, University of California. Vehicle manufacturers claim that fuel cell vehicles are signifi- cantly more fuel efficient and emit fewer emissions than conven- tional internal combustion engine vehicles. A computer model can help to explore and understand the underlying reasons for this poten- tial improvement. In previous published work, the UC Davis Vehi- cle Model for the case of a load-following Indirect Methanol Fuel Cell Vehicle (IMFCV) has been introduced and discussed in detail. Because of possible technical barriers with load following vehi- cles, as well as near term cost issues, hybrid fuel cell vehicle con- cepts are widely discussed as another fuel cell vehicle option. For load following vehicles, the questions of fast start up and fuel pro- cessor dynamics in extreme transient situations, (e.g., during phases of hard acceleration) are not totally resolved at this time. For both of these performance issues, a hybrid design could offer at least an interim solution. To investigate the potential of the Indirect Methanol Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicles (IMFCHV) further, the original model for the load following IMFCV has been expanded. First, a battery component model has been added (including a model of a battery controller). Second, a dc-dc converter component model has been included between the fuel cell stack and the battery (to ensure the proper inte- gration of the battery into the overall operation of the electrical sys- tem). The purpose of this work is to explain the underlying modeling philosophy, as well as the algorithms for the hybrid case. The approach followed in this IMFCHV model allows parametric studies to be made over a large range of configurations, and simpli- fies the effort involved in deciding the optimal design for a given scenario. Several examples are given to illustrate the capabilities of the model. However the paper is not meant to exhaustively answer spe- cific questions about fuel economy or other vehicle properties. Instead the focus is primarily on the explanation of the algorithms of the simulation, in order to allow a better understanding of the model itself. 2001-01-0544. (SP-1589) Simulated performance of an indi- rect methanol fuel cell system. Anthony Eggert, David Friedman, Sitaram Ramaswamy, Karl Hauer, Joshua Cunningham, and Robert Moore, UC-Davis. A detailed simulation of a load-following indirect methanol fuel cell (IMFC) system was performed by the University of California -Davis fuel cell vehicle modeling program (FCVMP) in order to determine the realistic steady-state and dynamic performance of such a system. The first part of the paper includes a basic description 75</page><page sequence="75">2001-01-0544-2001-01-0549 of the model and the control of the system. The interaction between the fuel processor and the anode side of the stack is shown to have dynamic load following limitations and a subsequent control strat- egy is described to solve this problem. The interaction between the air supply, the cathode side of the stack and the water recovery is shown to have several optimization opportunities. In the second part of the paper, we find that the steady-state effi- ciency of the system peaks at approximately 52% at around 5% of full power. The 25% of full power steady-state system efficiency is approximately 45% and the full-power efficiency is approximately 27%. This compares with the DOE goals for an IMFC system of 48% and 38% respectively. To determine the dynamic efficiency that could be expected from a load-following IMFC system, simula- tions were performed over the relatively anemic FUDS and then the more aggressive US06 drive cycles. Additionally, for each drive cycle, an expected steady-state efficiency is calculated. The expected steady-state efficiency is the efficiency of the system over the cycle assuming it could operate along the steady-state efficiency curve. The FUDS simulation gives a dynamic cycle efficiency of 43% versus an expected steady-state efficiency of 47%. The US06 gives a dynamic cycle efficiency of 37% versus an expected steady- state efficiency of 43%. We find the discrepancy between the expected steady-state and actual dynamic efficiencies is primarily attributed to the fuel processor. 2001-01-0545. (SP- 1574) Idling stop system coupled with quick start features of gasoline direct injection. K. Ueda, K. Kai- hara, K. Kurose , and H. Ando , Mitsubishi Motors Corp. The gasoline direct-injection engine starts significantly faster than a conventional engine. Fuel can be injected into the cylinder during the compression stroke at the same time of cranking start. When the spark plug ignites the mixture at the end of compression stroke, the engine has its first combustion, that is, the first combus- tion occurs within 0.2 sec after the start of cranking. This unique characteristic of quick startability has realized a idle stop system, which enables drivers to operate the vehicle in a natural manner. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0546. (SP- 1574) Hydrogen fueled engines in hybrid vehicles. Jay Keller and Andrew Lutz , Sandia National Laborato- ries. This paper describes the motivation for developing hydrogen- fueled engines for use in hybrid electric vehicles of the future. The ultimate motivation for using hydrogen as an energy carrier is car- bon management. However, air quality concerns also provide moti- vation for developing hydrogen-fueled vehicles. For this reason, we discuss the position of the hydrogen-powered hybrid vehicle within the California Air Resources Board requirement for Zero Emission Vehicles. We describe the expected performance of an electrical generation system powered by a four-stroke, spark-ignited, internal combustion engine for a hydrogen-powered hybrid vehicle. The data show that the engine-out emissions of NOx will allow the vehicle to operate below the Super Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle standard set by the California Air Resources Board. The engine can run on either hydro- gen or blends of hydrogen and natural gas. The engine can be opti- mized for maximum efficiency with low emissions. The target design for the engine-generator set is an indicated thermal efficiency of 47 % with emissions below 5 PPM of NOx. We estimate the over- all efficiency will be 40 %, yielding 60 miles per equivalent gallon of gasoline. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0547. (SP- 1574) Diesel engine combustion chamber geometry optimization using genetic algorithms and multi- dimensional spray and combustion modeling. D. D. Wickman , P. K. Senecal, and R. D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin. The recently developed KIVA-GA computer code was used in the current study to optimize the combustion chamber geometry of a heavy-duty diesel truck engine and a high-speed direct-injection (HSDI) small-bore diesel engine. KIVA-GA performs engine simu- lations within the framework of a genetic algorithm (GA) global optimization code. Design fitness was determined using a modified version of the KIVA-3V code, which calculates the spray, combus- tion, and emissions formation processes. The measure of design fit- ness includes NOx, unburned HC, and soot emissions, as well as fuel consumption. The simultaneous minimization of these factors was the ultimate goal. The KIVA-GA methodology was used to optimize the engine performance using nine input variables simultaneously. Three chamber geometry related variables were used along with six other variables, which were thought to have significant interaction with the chamber geometry. The input variables include the piston bowl radius, the piston bowl depth, the piston crown height, the start of injection (SOI) timing, the percent of cooled exhaust gas recircula- tion (EGR), the swirl ratio (SR) at intake valve closure (IVC), the duration of injection (DOI), the fuel injection nozzle hole size, and the angle of a fuel injection plume with respect to the cylinder axis. Both engines were optimized at a medium-speed, high-load condi- tion with a similar global equivalence ratio. The results show impressive reductions in both exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0548. (SP- 1574) High-energy spark-flow coupling in an IC engine for ultra-lean and high EGR mixtures. Michael A. V. Ward, Combustion Electromagnetics Inc. The role of high-energy ignition in the combustion of ultra-lean and high EGR air-fuel mixtures has been misunderstood as a result of neglecting a critical component to ignition: the coupling of the spark to a flowing mixture. Coupling of a suitably designed high- energy spark to the mixture flow in an engine not only increases spark energy delivery but significantly increases the lean burn capa- bility of an engine. Tests in a single-cylinder, two- val ve, homoge- neous charge gasoline engine designed with high squish flow and dual high-energy spark plugs located in the high flow field have resulted in considerable extension of the lean misfire limit of the engine to 30-to-l air-fuel ratio (k= 2), with significantly improved fuel economy at light engine loads and lower emissions throughout the entire engine operating range. 2001-01-0549. (SP- 1574) Use of dynamic valving to achieve residual-affected combustion. N. B. Kaahaaina, A. J. Simon, P. A. Caton, and C. F. Edwards, Stanford Univ. Studies have been conducted to assess the potential of variable valve actuation to initiate homogeneous charge compression igni- tion (HCCI) through reinduction of exhaust from the previous com- bustion cycle. As opposed to strategies which induce HCCI through use of either intake or exhaust throttling, use of exhaust reinduction incurs no pumping penalty, making it particularly attractive as a method for achieving efficient, light-load combustion. Using a fully flexible electrohydraulic valve actuation system, tests were con- ducted on a single-cylinder research engine using three strategies: late exhaust valve closing, late intake valve opening (used in con- junction with the exhaust valve being left open throughout the intake stroke), and a combination of the two. Results show that IMEP val- ues from - 30-55% of unthrottled SI combustion output could be obtained by varying the valve timings used to implement reinduc- tion. Phasing of autoignition was found to depend strongly on exhaust valve closing time. Peak pressures during HCCI were as large as those found for unthrottled SI combustion (at MBT timing) despite the fact that only a fraction of the work output was produced in HCCI mode. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 76</page><page sequence="76">200 1 -0 1 -05 50- 200 1 -0 1 -05 56 2001-01-0550. (SP- 1574) Mixing control and combustion in gasoline direct injection engines for reducing cold-start emis- sions. Shigeo Yamamoto , Dai Tanaka, Jun Takemura , Osamu Nakayama , and Hiromitsu Ando , Mitsubishi Motors Corp. A two-stage combustion is one of the Mitsubishi GDI™ technol- ogies for a quick catalyst warm-up on a cold start. However, when the combustion is continued for a long time, an increase in the fuel consumption is a considerable problem. To solve the problem, a stratified slight-lean combustion is newly introduced for utilization of catalysis. The stratified mixture with slightly lean overall air-fuel ratio is prepared by the late stage injection during the compression stroke. By optimizing an interval between the injection and the spark timing, the combustion simultaneously supplies substantial CO and surplus 02 to a catalyst while avoiding the soot generation and the fouling of a spark plug. The CO oxidation on the catalyst is utilized to reduce the cold-start emissions. Immediately after the cold-start, the catalyst is preheated for the minimum time to start the CO oxidation by using the two-stage combustion. Following that, the stratified slight-lean combustion is performed. The combustion induces the powerful CO oxidation on the catalyst. The oxidation warms up the catalyst and also promotes the HC oxidation. This strategy results in improvement of the fuel economy while reducing the cold-start emissions because the two-stage combustion is almost replaced to the stratified slight-lean combustion, which drastically decreases the fuel consumption. The stratified slight-lean combus- tion is rapid and stable even when the spark timing is retarded after the TDC. The characteristics are also utilized for the catalyst warm-up without using the two-stage combustion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0551.

Johnson, B KM Inc.; and Kuhl. A. L., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. A study of the influence of dilution, attained by air excess, upon the dynamic stage of combustion - the nucleus of a work producing cycle - in a diesel engine, is reported as a sequel of SAE 2000-01- 0203. While the latter has been restricted to variation in dilution obtained by bleeding air compressed by the supercharger, here the scope of engine tests was expanded by incorporating an additional stage of compression. Besides revealing the mechanism of the dynamic stage, the paper demonstrates that its effectiveness is a lin- ear function of the air excess coefficient, irrespectively how it is attained. 2001-01-0552. (SP-1585) Fuel evaporation parameter identi- fication during SI cold start. J. E. Pakkala and J. B. Burl, Michi- gan Technological Univ. The stochastic properties of continuous time model parameters obtained through discrete least squares estimation are examined. Particular attention is given to the application of estimating the fuel evaporation dynamics of a V-8 SI engine. The continuous time parameter distributions in this case are biased. The bias is shown to be a function of both measurement noise and sampling rate selec- tion. Analysis and experimental results suggest that for each particu- lar model, there is a corresponding optimum sampling rate. A bias compensation formula is proposed that improves the accuracy of least squares estimation without iterative techniques. 2001-01-0553. (SP-1585) Dynamic EGR estimation for pro- duction engine control. Martin Müller, Peter M. Olin, and Bart Schreurs, Delphi Automotive Systems. A dynamic EGR State Estimator (ESE) intended for production engine management systems (EMS) implementation is presented. It better describes the development of external exhaust gas recircula- tion (EGR) concentration at the engine intake ports during EGR transients than traditional models. The dynamics of EGR concentra- tion time and spatial development in the intake manifold are described as a perfect mixing model in the intake manifold plenum volume and non-mixing plug flow in the intake manifold runners. The time scale of EGR transients precludes the use of traditional EGR measurement techniques for model verification. Instead a wide range air fuel (WRAF) sensor is used. Results are shown for a large variation in operating conditions and compared to the performance of a traditional model. The introduction of an exhaust inert ratio model converts the EGR estimate into the inert EGR concentration, the distinction between total and inert EGR concentration being of relevance for lean operating engines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0554. (SP-1585) A model-based environment for production Engine Management System (EMS) development. Carl Cao, Donn Shull, and Ed Himes, Delphi Automotive Systems. This paper describes an environment for the development of pro- duction Engine Management Systems (EMS). This includes a for- mal framework and modeling methodology. The environment is based on using Simulink/Stateflow for developing a control system executable specification and a plant model. This allows for simula- tions of the system to be performed at the engineer's desk, which is identical performance with production software. We provide the details for incorporating production legacy code into the Simulink/ Stateflow control system. The system includes a multi-rate, and event driven operating system. This system is developed to facilitate new algorithm development and automated software testing. Based on Simulink/Stateflow this specification will be suitable for use with commercial automatic code generation tools. The executable speci- fication is structured to move smoothly from simulation on the desk- top to rapid prototyping in the development vehicle using a dSPACE AutoBox and a development electronic control unit. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0555. (SP-1585) Modeling and validation of traveling resistance for heavy trucks. Tony Sandberg, SCANIA CV AB. Low fuel consumption is very important for a heavy truck. Doing measurements of fuel consumption in a real vehicle is though com- plicated and very time-consuming. The main problem is that mea- surements are not repeatable. By use of computer simulations an ideal but repeatable result of fuel consumption and emissions can be created and differences between vehicles can be studied. A computer program to simulate fuel consumption and emissions for heavy trucks in long haulage has been created, using the object- oriented software DYMOLA. It has a longitudinal vehicle model and an engine model based on steady-state measurements. In this paper the validation of external forces, like air resistance and rolling resistance, is presented. This has been achieved by equipping a heavy truck with strain gauges to measure the torque on the propeller shaft. Several tests have been run at various cons- tant speeds on flat road. After modification of the powertrain modules, mainly the rolling resistance, a difference between simulations and measurements of only 0.015 Nm at all speeds has been reached. The vehicle model should therefore have all prerequisites to make good calculations of fuel consumption. 2001-01-0556.

(SP-1585) Object-oriented modeling of intake air flow control system. T. Carlsson and A. Sokolov , Mecel AB; and A. Idebrant and M. Jirstrand, MathCore AB. The paper demonstrates object-oriented physical modeling of SI engine control system components. The intake airflow control sys- tem is chosen as a typical example including multiple physical domains such as fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, mechanics, and electromagnetics. The model can be used for balancing the design of system components. Design models of different actuators such as a DC motor and a bi-directional solenoid are included and analyzed. The focus is on the multi-domain aspects of modeling of the flow control system and actuator components. The modeling effort with an object-oriented environment is mainly reduced to adequate model representation and creation of a component library. A new object library has been developed using Modélica language in addition to the standard Modélica library. The modeling and simulation software MathModelica has been used for implementing the component library. MathModelica has a conve- nient interface and operational functionality allowing fast imple- mentation of libraries if an object-oriented representation of a sys- tem has been achieved. Models can be created by connecting already available components graphically in a model editor or use so called notebooks for textual modeling. The models are equation-based, i.e., inputs and outputs are not fixed by design in the model (acausal modeling) but depend on how the model is connected to other mod- els. This makes it reusable in a variety of different contexts. This paper reveals the difficulties of the object-oriented represen- tation of the thermo-fluid and electromagnetic physical systems and demonstrates solution approaches. A flow model across the throttle plate has been developed in accordance with the object-oriented paradigm. Different electromagnetic actuators have been modeled to drive the throttle plate. Among them are DC motor and bi-directional solenoid considered in the paper as an alternative design option to throttle control. Although this actuator is less power-efficient com- pared to the common DC motor actuator it has a cost-effective design. 2001-01-0558. (SP-1585) A production wide-range AFR sen- sor response diagnostic algorithm for direct-injection gasoline application. Peter J. Maloney , Delphi Energy &amp; Chassis Systems. A wide-range Air-Fuel Ratio sensor (WRAF) response diagnos- tic algorithm was developed for production application in Gasoline Direct Injection (Gas-DI) powertrains to fulfill On Board Diagnostic (OBD) legislative requirements for wide-range oxygen sensors. The algorithm measures the response of a wide-range air-fuel ratio (AFR) sensor signal to an input AFR signal of known amplitude to determine whether degradation in sensor responsiveness is severe enough to cause a failure of legal emissions requirements. A practical IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) digital bandpass fil- ter design was used in series with a rectifier and low-pass filter to process the AFR sensor signal for comparison to a reference signal amplitude. The IIR filter was designed with a moveable pass-band to enable the algorithm to be used at variable frequencies during intrusive and non-intrusive sensor diagnostic tests. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0559. (SP-1585) OBD engine fault detection using a neural approach. Carlo N. Grimaldi and Francesco Mariani , Uni- versity of Perugia. The present work is the continuation of the research activity developed by the same authors in last years about the use of recent technologies (Artificial Neural Networks) for the set up of "software redundancy" modules to be implemented on board for the use in Diagnostic Systems. In the present work, a system based on Artificial Neural Net- works models for automotive engines Fault Diagnosis and Isolation purposes is set-up and analyzed. Four sensors/actuators (throttle valve, rotational speed, torque and intake manifold pressure) are considered, and the respective acquired data are used to train and test four ANN modules correlating the different quantities. An FDI scheme is presented which generates fault codes sequences by suitably treating the primary residuals, obtained by comparing experimental data with the calculated ones by the ANN modules. The robust fault isolation capabilities of the proposed FDI system are presented and discussed. The proposed model architec- ture appears as suitable to solve either OBD problems or quality controls at factory engine production lines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0560. Strategies for handling the fuel additive prob- lem in neural network-based ion current interpretation. Stefan Byttner, Thorsteinn Rögnvaldsson, and Nicholas Wickström , Halm- stad Univ. With the introduction of unleaded gasoline, special fuel agents have appeared on the market for lubricating and cleaning the valve seats. These fuel agents often contain alkali metals that have a sig- nificant impact on the ion current signal, thus affecting strategies that use the ion current for engine control and diagnosis, e.g., for estimating the location of the pressure peak. This paper introduces a method for making neural network algorithms robust to expected disturbances in the input signal and demonstrates how well this method applies to the case of disturbances to the ion current signal due to fuel additives containing sodium. The performance of the neural estimators is compared to a Gaussian fit algorithm, which they outperform. It is also shown that using a fuel additive signifi- cantly improves the estimation of the location of the pressure peak. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0561. (SP-1585) Information based selection of neu- ral networks training data for S.I. engine mapping. Ivan Arsie, Fabrizio Marotta, Cesare Pianese, and Gianfranco Rizzo, Univer- sity of Salerno. The paper deals with the application of two techniques for the selection of the training data set used for the identification of Neural Network black-box engine models; the research starts from previous studies on Sequential Experimental Design for regression based engine models. The implemented methodologies rely on the Active Learning approach (i.e., active selection of training data) and are ori- ented to drive the experiments for the Neural Network training. The methods allow to select the most significant examples leading to an improvement of model generalization with respect to a heuristic choice of the training data. The data selection is performed making use of two different formulation, originally proposed by MacKay and Cohn, based on the Shannon's Statistic Entropy and on the Mean Error Variance respectively. These techniques have been applied to assist the training of artificial Neural Networks for the estimation of engine torque and exhaust emissions of an S.I. engine, to be embedded into a powertrain dynamic model for the optimal design of engine control strategies (O.D.E.C.S.), now in use at Magneti Marelli. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0562.

Xi Gang, Zhang Jianwu, and Chen Li, Shanghai Jiaotong Univ. 78</page><page sequence="78">2001-01-0562-2001-01-0573 A flat neural network is designed for the on-line state prediction of engine.

Simulation of the piston/cylinder behavior for diesel engines. Peter Reipert and Marco Voigt , KS Kolbenschmidt GmbH. When developing diesel engines, some key points will always exist: minimizing noise, reducing internal friction - ultimately fuel consumption - and preventing liner cavitation. To reach economi- cally these targets, the assistance of sophisticated simulation tools is necessary. By means of some selected examples, the simulation procedures and the quality of their results are demonstrated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0565. A methodology to simulate piston secondary movement under lubricated contact conditions. Günter Offner , TU Graz ; and Hubert M. Herbst and Hans H. Priebsch, AVL List GmbH. The authors want to introduce a general methodology for the simulation of the dynamics of the piston-liner contact considering a realistic oil film at inner liner wall. Because of the complexity of this problem and in order to minimize computing time a twin model was developed. Firstly, a simplified model is used to compute piston motion trends and piston ring lubrication in minimum simulation time. Secondly a very detailed model simulating multi-body dynam- ics, surface vibrations and elasto-hydrodynamic contact is applied. Both, the theoretical background of the twin model and the advantages of the coupled simulation procedure given in the wide range of considerable influences are discussed. The result examples focus on interaction effects of piston secondary movement and the influence of the available oil film. Finally, the status of verification of the models using measured results is shown. 2001-01-0566. Effects of lubricating oil supply on reductions of piston slap vibration and piston friction. Sunao Teraguchi, Wataru Suzuki , and Masaaki Takiguchi, Musashi Institute of Tech- nology; and Daijiro Sato , Isuzu Motors Ltd. This study has been conducted aiming at reductions of piston slap noise and piston friction loss, and effects of lubricating oil sup- ply between the piston skirt and cylinder on diesel engine have been verified through a series of experiments. Namely, lubricating oil was supplied forcibly into the piston skirt from outside of engine, and its effects on the cylinder block vibration, piston friction force, slap motion and oil consumption have been measured. As a result, it has been verified that the supply of a small amount of oil (6mL/min) to the piston skirt reduces about 50% of the block vibration caused by the piston slap motion in idling operation, and about 20% of the pis- ton friction loss in full load operation. Furthermore it has verified without giving any significant adverse effect on oil consumption. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0569. Analytical and empirical methods for optim- ization of cylinder liner bore distortion. Franz Maassen, Franz Koch , and Markus Schwaderlapp , FEV Motorentechnik GmbH; and Timo Ortjohann , and Jürgen Dohmen , RWTH Aachen. Beside the traditional prediction of stresses and verification by mechanical testing the optimization of cylinder liner bore distortion is one of today's most important topics in crankcase structure devel- opment. Low bore distortion opens up potentials for optimizing the piston group. As the piston rings achieve better sealing characteris- tics in a low deformation cylinder liner, oil consumption and blow-by are reduced. For unchanged oil consumption and blow-by demands, engine friction and subsequently, fuel consumption could be reduced by decreasing the pre-tension of the piston rings. From the acoustical point of view an optimization of piston-slap noise is often based on an optimized bore distortion behavior. Apart from basics to the behavior of liner bore distortion the paper presents advanced analytical and empirical methods for detailed prediction, verification and optimization of bore distortion taking into account the effective engine operation conditions. In that matter design features and other important influence parameters for bore distortion will be discussed and evaluated. 2001-01-0571. Contact pressure distribution of piston rings - Calculation based on piston ring contour. Michio Okamoto and Itsuro Sakai , Teikoku Piston Ring Co ., Ltd. The piston ring design using low tangential force to reduce fric- tion loss has become a general trend in engine development - especially in passenger car engine - in recent years. This trend emphasizes the importance of stable sealing function that does not require much tangential force. Thus, it is important to grasp the cor- rect pressure distribution between the ring and the cylinder. Reliable and accurate calculation to understand the pressure distribution has been an issue for many years among the engineers. In this report, we propose a new calculation method based on the piston ring contour in a free condition. Generally, the piston ring contour is calculated to achieve its correspondence to a given pres- sure distribution. By analyzing inversely, the pressure distribution is calculated when a ring contour is given. But as is well known, the solution is often unstable in inverse analyses. We introduced the idea of the method of least squares to avoid this problem. In our investigation, the ring contour was obtained from our originally developed equipment using a laser displacement meter. The calculated results were compared with different types of rings - the strong contact type and weak contact type in the gap direction. The results showed the good agreement for both ring types. 2001-01-0572. Piston ring pack and cylinder wear modeling. Eduardo Tomanik and Francisco E. B. Nigro , Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnológicas. Wear of piston ring and cylinder was modeled through a com- puter code that calculates the hydrodynamic and roughness contact pressures acting on the contact surfaces. Both pressures are fully and coupled solved through, respectively, Reynolds equation and Green- wood-Williamson model. Piston secondary motion and piston groove thermal deformations are considered. The latter was discov- ered to be fundamental in defining the top ring worn profile. Due to the rough contact pressures, the model predicts material removal from both piston ring and cylinder surfaces and recalculates the sys- tem, hence simulating the evolution of the worn sliding surface of both parts. The predicted wear of the piston ring pack and the cylin- der wall are compared with a medium-duty diesel engine tested for 750 hours in dynamometer. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0573. Exploring PVD coatings for cylinder liner applications. Padma Kodali and Nicole Stahley, Cummins Engine Co. A number of wear resistant coatings has been developed using physical vapor deposition(PVD) process. However this coating pro- cess has not yet been widely used in the automotive industry. The purpose of this work was to evaluate thin PVD coatings such as dia- mond like carbon doped with tungsten (W-DLC), molybdenum- disulfide doped with aluminum (M0S2-AI), and chrome nitride (CrN). Some of these coatings were previously found to have low friction, high wear resistance, or both when tested in unlubricated conditions. In the present work, the experiments were conducted using a Cameron-Plint apparatus in lubricated conditions. The ring counterfaces used were Cr-plated and gas-nitrided compression 79</page><page sequence="79">2001-01-0573-2001-01-0579 rings. Our data also indicated that some PVD coatings with thick- nesses in the same order of magnitude as the surface roughness of the liners did show some improvement in liner wear resistance. The suitability of thin coatings for liner applications needs additional study. In addition, the process cannot be immediately applied to large diameter cylinders. 2001-01-0574. (SP- 1606) A method to reduce the calculation time for an internal combustion engine model. Klaus Allmend- inger ' DaimlerChrysler AG; Lino Guzzella and Adrian Seiler , ETH Zürich; and Otmar Loffeld , University Siegen. Coming along with the present movement towards the ultimately variable engine, the need for clear and simple models for complex engine systems is rapidly increasing. In this context, Common-Rail Systems cause a special kind of problem due to of the high amount of parameters which cannot be taken into consideration with simple map-based models. For this reason models with a higher amount of complexity are necessary to realize a representative behavior of the simulation. The high computational time of the simulation, which is caused by the increased complexity, makes it nearly impossible to implement this type of model in software in closed loop applica- tions or simulations for control purposes. In this paper, a method for decreasing the complexity and accelerating the computing time of automotive engine models is being evaluated which uses an opti- mized method for each stage of the diesel engine process. Except for the gas exchange phase, this approach works analytically and independent of engine maps. Investigations result in the capability of the above mentioned approach to perform engine simulations while reducing the computing time. 2001-01-0575. (SP- 1606) Modeling SI engines for hybrid vehicles. Petter Strandh and Rolf Egnell, Lund Institute of Technol- ogy. One of the most attractive features of hybrid vehicles powered by SI engines with three-way catalysts is the potential of reaching extremely low emissions. In conventional dri vētrains, limitations in the air/fuel control result in lambda excursions during transients. These deviations from the ideal lambda result in increased emis- sions. In a hybrid vehicle, rapid load and speed changes of the SI engine could be limited to an acceptable level as the battery acts as a power buffer. However, the efficiency of charging and discharging the bat- ter is rather low, which means that excessive power buffering will increase the fuel consumption of the vehicle. Thus it is of great importance to know what degree of speed and load changes that air/ fuel control system could cope with without an increase in emis- sions. Most SI engine models for hybrid vehicles are quasi stationary, which means that data achieved at stationary load conditions are assumed to be representative for transient operation as well. In this paper, a concept is presented in which stationary engine data is used, but corrected for the effects of lambda excursions. In the present paper the model is described in depth and some calculated experiments are presented. It is found that load changes in the range of 20% to 90% at fre- quencies higher than 0.5 Hz will result in lambda excursions that probably will result in unacceptable emissions. 2001-01-0576. (SP- 1606) The design of turbocharged engines using ID simulation. David Gurney , Cosworth Technology Ltd. ID wave action simulation has been used to construct models of a number of turbocharged spark ignition engines. This paper describes how the models have been applied in the development of those engines. The simulation has been used to optimize a number of compo- nents including the inlet and exhaust manifolds, the valve timing and the turbo match. The models have been validated against test data. The method of modeling unsteady flow is described and the behavior of the turbocharger in unsteady flow investigated. 2001-01-0577. (SP- 1606) Evolution-strategy based, fully auto- matic, numerical optimization of gas-exchange systems for IC engines. W. Zücker , R. R. Maly, and S. Wagner , DaimlerChrysler AG. Today, a number of simulation codes are available for pre- designing gas exchange systems of IC engines with good accuracy (e.g. PROMO, WAVE, GT-Power). However, optimizing such sys- tems still requires numerous time-consuming and inefficient trial and error runs. Also, accounting for constraints as size, volume, peak combustion pressure etc., multiplies the necessary efforts addi- tionally. Hence there is a strong need for efficient procedures for finding optimum designs automatically and reliably. To automatically find the global optimum design parameters under a given set of real constraints of a practical case, a multi- membered evolution-strategy based optimization code was devel- oped. The code which efficiently finds the true optimum dimensions of gas exchange systems (duct lengths, duct diameters, volumes) of an IC engine. The code can be readily generalized, and adapted to arbitrary optimization problems. The code is built around an evolution strategy based on 4 parents and 20 descendants. The properties of the descendants are statisti- cally varied in each generation with a standard deviation of 0.2. As a test case a 3-valve single-cylinder test engine was used with 10 free parameters of the gas exchange system. After a maximum of 3500 calls of the 1-D flow code (worst case), the global optimum is automatically found in all tests. Usually, optimum results are obtained for far less calls. Cross checks of the performance of optimization strategies were carried out with gradient methods (fastest, if uni-modal) and 2-membered evolution- strategies (for cases of low complexity). Whereas the gradient methods fail in multi-modal (i.e. normal) cases, the 2-membered evolution strategy is attractive only for low numbers of free parameters (e.g., &lt; 4). Experimental checks with conventional trial and error optimized engines showed that these engines could all be optimized further by implementing the global optimum design parameters predicted by our code. In this paper the evolution-based optimization strategy is pres- ented in detail and compared to other optimization strategies. The main features of the code are discussed and the results are shown for two typical cases. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0578. (SP- 1606) Computer simulation of a four- stroke spark ignition engine. G. H. Abd Alia, Al-Ain Technical School. This paper introduces the preliminary simulation of a four- stroke spark ignition engine. An arbitrary heat release formula was used to predict the cylinder pressure, which was used to find out the indi- cated work done. The heat transfer from the cylinder, friction and pumping losses also were taken into account to predict the brake mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel consumption. Most of the parameters that can affect the perfor- mance of the four stroke spark ignition engines such as equivalence ratios, spark timing, heat release rate, compression ratios, compres- sion index and expansion index are studied. The use of a real com- bustion curve has a profound influence on the similarity of the pres- sure-volume profile to that seen for the real engine. The modeling process is obviously getting closer to reality and is now worth pursu- ing as a design aid. 2001-01-0579. (SP-1606) The quasi-propagatory model: A new approach for describing transient phenomena in engine manifolds. Roberto Cipollone and Antonio Sciarretta, University of L'Aquila. 80</page><page sequence="80">200 1 -0 1 -0579-200 1 -0 1 -0586 The Quasi-Propagatory Model (QPM), a new approach to simu- late fluid transients in duct systems, is presented in this paper. The model fills the gap existing between lumped-parameter and distrib- uted-parameter models, allowing the simulation of propagátory effects, even in a compact, lumped-parameter framework. The model, previously developed for homentropic flows, is extended here to include the presence of section variations, friction and heat flows. This is done without substantially altering the model architecture. A theoretical and an experimental validation of the QPM have been carried out. Test cases have been run and the results compared with those yielded by the Method of Characteristics, which was taken as a reference model. Moreover, the model predictions were also compared with experimental data measured in a pipe test rig. 2001-01-0580. (SP- 1606) Transient phenomena in one- dimensional ducts. Roberto Cipollone and Carlo Villanie , Univer- sity of L'Aquila. In reciprocating IC engines, very precise predictions of the mass of air inducted are required in order to improve engine design. To achieve this goal, a deeper knowledge of the boundary conditions on intake and exhaust manifolds must be obtained. A set of very accurate experimental data is also needed to perform model valida- tion. In this paper an experimental activity has been performed on a pipe test-rig which guarantees high reproducibility of the fluid- dynamic transients. Basing on the obtained data, the authors intro- duced two parameters, which are able to improve the precision of the dynamical models of the flow past valves and through sudden enlargements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0581. (SP- 1606) Air charge estimation in camless engines. M. J. van Nieuwstadt ; I. V. Kolmanovsky, M. Haghgooie , and M. Hammoud, Ford Motor Co. An electromechanically driven valve train offers unprecedented flexibility to optimize engine operation for each speed load point individually. One of the main benefits is the increased fuel economy resulting from unthrottled operation. The absence of a restriction at the entrance of the intake manifold leads to wave propagation in the intake system and makes a direct measurement of air flow with a hot wire air meter unreliable. To deliver the right amount of fuel for a desired air-fuel ratio, we therefore need an open-loop estimate of the air flow based on measureable or commanded signals or quanti- ties. This paper investigates various expressions for air charge in camless engines based on quasi-static assumptions for heat transfer and pressure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0582. Comparison of performance between several vehicle windshield defrosting and demisting mechanisms. A. Aroussi , A. Hassan , and B. R. Clayton , University of Nottingham; and B. S. AbdulNour, Ford Motor Co. The safety and comfort aspects of passenger cars are significant sales argument and have become a topic of rising importance during the development process of a new car. The objective of this study is to compare the performance of several current model vehicles, highlight the drawbacks of current defrosting/demisting systems and point the way to improved passive mechanisms. The investigation is experimental. The experiments are carried out using full-scale current vehicle models. The results show that the current designs of the defroster nozzle give maximum airflow rates in the vicinity of the lower part of the windshield, which decrease gradually towards the upper parts of the windshield. This hinders and limits the vision of the driver, particularly at the top of the windshield, which can be uncomfort- able and indeed dangerous. 2001-01-0583. Conditions for incipient windshield fogging and anti-fog strategy for automatic climate control. L. I. Davis, Jr. and G. A. Dage, Ford Motor Co.; and J. D. Hoeschele, Visteon Corp. This paper describes a strategy, suitable for use in a climate con- trol ATC (Automatic Temperature Controller) for predicting the onset or existence of fog (or misting) conditions and automatically taking action to avoid or reduce such conditions. Two variables cur- rently measured by the ATC, cabin air temperature and ambient (outside) temperature are combined with cabin air relative humidity information provided by an additional sensor to allow the calcula- tion of a degree of likelihood of windshield/window fogging. As fogging conditions are approached, a staged alteration of climate control strategy can relieve or even avoid altogether windshield fogging. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0584. A parametric approach for rapid design and analysis of automotive HVAC defrost systems. William R. Hill and Sriram Sringari, General Motors Corp. The overall vision of this project was to develop a new technol- ogy that will be an enabler to reduce design and development time of HVAC systems by an order of magnitude. The objective initially was to develop a parametric model of an automotive HVAC Wind- shield Defrost Duct coupled to a passenger compartment. It can be used early on in the design cycle for conducting coarse packaging studies by quickly exploring "what-if ' design alternatives. In addi- tion to the packaging studies, performance of these design scenarios can be quickly studied by undertaking CFD simulation and analyz- ing flow distribution and windshield melting patterns. The validated geometry and CFD models can also be used as knowledge building tools to create knowledge data warehouses or repositories for pre- cious lessons learned. 2001-01-0585. Development and application of an integrated dew point and glass temperature sensor. Thomas M. Urbank, Sean M. Kelly, Timothy O. King, and Charles A. Archibald, Delphi Automotive Systems, Inc. With the optimization of HVAC system controls for comfort, air quality and energy efficiency the potential for fogging the glass has increased. To maintain occupant safety, a method to predict when such fogging conditions exist is necessary to be able to execute proactive control corrections to prevent fogging. Windshield fog conditions are predicated on windshield surface temperature, cabin relative humidity and the reference temperature of the humidity sen- sor. This has driven a joint development project between Delphi Automotive Systems divisions to develop an Integrated Dew Point and Glass Temperature (IDGT) sensor. This sensor is a combination of three elements: a glass temperature sensor, a relative humidity sensor, and a humidity reference temperature sensor. Using this sen- sor package, the cabin dew point is calculated from the relative humidity and humidity reference temperature for comparison with the windshield glass temperature. When the windshield glass tem- perature drops to or is below the cabin dew point temperature, fog will form on the windshield. Utilizing this information, a proactive automatic climate control system implements corrections before the occurrence of fogging. This paper discusses the following issues concerning this new technology: Sensor design and development. A comparison between the existing technologies and the new sensor design. Vehicle/system integration of the sensor. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0586.

Transitional effective temperature, which is new index of thermal sensation, is proposed and verified to correspond with subjects' thermal sensation votes. The simulation system has two advantage beside the prediction of thermal sensa- tion; automatic generation of a computational model and coupling analysis of temperature including an analysis of temperature distri- bution inside a cabin, refrigerating cycle, solar radiation, and so on. It was verified that this system well predicts occupant's thermal sen- sation in a short time. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0587. Automotive A/C system integrated with elec- trically controlled variable capacity scroll compressor and fuzzy logic refrigerant flow management. X. Zeng and G. A. Major , General Motors Corp.; and T. Hirao , M. Sekita , and M. Fujitani, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. This paper describes the recent efforts on developing an automo- tive climate control system throughout integrating an electrically- controlled variable capacity scroll compressor with a fuzzy logic control-based refrigerant flow management. Applying electrically controlled variable capacity compressor technology to climate control systems has a significant impact on improving vehicle fuel economy, achieving higher passenger com- fort level, and extending air and refrigerant temperature controlla- bility as well. In this regard, it is very important for automotive cli- mate control engineers to layout a system-level temperature control strategy so that the operation of variable capacity compressor can be optimized through integrating the component control schemes into the system-level temperature control. Electronically controlled expansion devices have become widely available in automotive air conditioning (A/C) systems for the future vehicle applications. An electronic expansion valve (EXV), similar to the mechanically actuated thermostatic expansion valve (TXV), is a flow control device whose operational goal is to throttle and reg- ulate the refrigerant flow rate. Principally, TXV regulates the refrig- erant entering the evaporating equipment in response to the super- heat variation. Comparing to the mechanical actuation mechanism of TXV, the electronically modulated EXV gives the additional flexibility to apply the microprocessor-based intelligent control. Accordingly, a fuzzy logic algorithm of EXV has been incorporated to the A/C system control in order to achieve a high efficiency and optimal operation. The primary objectives of this paper are to (a) present the design features and control mechanism of an electrically-controlled vari- able capacity scroll compressor; (b) describe the temperature control system architecture of refrigeration circuit and air flow manage- ment; (c) describe the architecture of fuzzy logic control of a refrig- erant flow control; and (d) discuss and analyze the results obtained in bench testing. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0588. Virtual thermal comfort engineering. Taeyoung Han, Linjie Huang, and Sean Kelly, Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems; and Charlie Huizenga, and Zhang Hui, Univer- sity of California. Simulation of passenger compartment climatic conditions is becoming increasingly important as a complement to wind tunnel and field testing to help achieve improved thermal comfort while reducing vehicle development time and cost. Delphi Harrison Ther- mal Systems has collaborated with the University of California, Berkeley to develop the capability of predicting occupant thermal comfort to support automotive climate control systems. At the core of this Virtual Thermal Comfort Engineering (VTCE) technique is a model of the human thermal regulatory system based on Stolwijk's model but with several enhancements. Our model uses 16 body seg- ments and each segment is modeled as four body layers (core, mus- cle, fat, and skin tissues) and a clothing layer. The comfort model has the ability to predict local thermal comfort level of an occupant in a highly non-uniform thermal environment as a function of air temperature, surrounding surface temperatures, air velocity, humid- ity, direct solar flux, as well as the level of activity and clothing type of each individual. VTCE takes into account the geometrical config- uration of the passenger compartment including glazing surfaces, pertinent physical and thermal properties of the enclosure with par- ticular emphasis on glass properties. Use of Virtual Thermal Com- fort Engineering (VTCE) will allow for exploration of different cli- mate control strategies as they relate to human thermal comfort in a quick and inexpensive manner. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0589. Stationary model to predict performance of the car air conditioning system using only standard components data. Vito Melisurgo, Centro Ricerche Fiat. A stationary model of a car air conditioning system was devel- oped to evaluate refrigerant, mechanical power and all the fluid properties along the circuit. The model requires only the characteris- tics of the constituents, which are normally available from suppliers. This approach enables estimation of system performance with satisfactory accuracy, already during the design approach, and allows to determine the most appropriate components in order to meet target requirements with a satisfactory balance of the refriger- ant circuit. 2001-01-0590. New approach to climate control system com- ponents evaluation. Alexander V. Moultanovsky and Brett Herr- mann, Bergstrom Climate Systems, Inc. During the design phase of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air- Conditioning (HVAC) unit, many factors play a key role in the eval- uation of system performance. However, the most decisive factors are the actual performance of each component. These components include evaporator, heater, and blower package. Any one of these components can have a dramatic impact on the overall system per- formance. Current performance evaluation techniques do not allow for the all-around comparison of each component. The special formulas and, respectively, special numerical values have been created for each component comparison problem. These numerical values are either Common Comparison Coefficient (CCC) for component comparison, which this paper centers on or Degree of Comparison for comparison of sealing capabilities. The comparison of test results shows significant advantages and convenience of proposed approach for components evaluation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0591. Automatic climate control of the recreation vehicle with dual HVAC system. M. H. Kim, Y. M. Yang, H. T. Jeong, G. S. Kwon, and J. A. Jung, VDO Halla Korea; G. Y. Jang, Mando Climate Control; and K. W. Kim, and D. W. Shin, Hyundai Motor Co. In this paper, we deal with the automatic climate control for Rec- reational Vehicle (RV). The HVAC system used for RV was com- posed of front side and rear side. And, the HVAC system of front side differed from that of rear side in the characteristic of HVAC system. This system was economically optimized for automatic control over 2 separated zones. The development procedure of automatic climate controller was as follows. The first stage was to derive con- trol equation from characteristic analysis of HVAC system and the structural characteristic of vehicle interior. In the second stage, the software (S/W) was designed and programmed to operate micropro- cessor which calculated previously mentioned equation. Finally, the hardware (H/W) design and building were performed to operate the HVAC system with the calculation results from microprocessor. The control performance of this automatic climate control algo- rithm and system was evaluated by experimental method. The automatic climate controller in this paper controlled front and rear side with 10 input variables and 11 output variables. This system was controlled by 'Proportional Feed Forward Control The- ory.' It was generally used in automatic climate control of vehicle. The basic control equation was induced from a thermal balance 82</page><page sequence="82">200 1 -0 1 -059 1 -200 1 -0 1 -0602 equation of the cabin interior. The control performance of this sys- tem has satisfied the conventional specifications. The HVAC system installed in the rear side had an evaporator and a heater separately. Therefore, it had a big difference from nor- mal 'reheat air mixing system.' That was why the stability and cli- mate control capacity of system were compared and optimized. This paper should be a milestone the automatic climate control for RV and Multi-zones. 2001-01-0592. Entropy-minimized optimization of an auto- motive air conditioning and HVAC system. Ali Heydari and Saeed Jani , Sharif University of Technology . This paper describes an integrated engineering approach for a mathematical modeling of an automotive air-conditioner system and method for performing heating and cooling load calculations of a vehicle shell assembly for designing an HVAC system for a passen- ger vehicle. In addition, there is presented a physical optimization technique based on minimization of the total entropy generation for the vehicle air-conditioner and HVAC system. Simultaneous solution of the automotive air-conditioning, air handling and the passenger cabin thermal model provide the tran- sient temperature history for consideration of passenger comfort conditions. The validity of the mathematical model was confirmed using experimental data. Optimization of the developed model is performed based on min- imization of the total entropy generation of the air-conditioning air- handling system. Further minimization of the system entropy gener- ation with respect to parameters of the air-conditioner or the HVAC system as well as those of the vehicle passenger compartment pro- vide an optimization path for proper design and selection of the vehicle air-conditioning, HVAC and passenger compartment com- ponents. The result of this work assists the automotive industry with pro- viding them with a mathematical tool for analysis of vehicle air- conditioning and HVAC system design and optimization. 2001-01-0594. (SP- 1576) Mixed H-inflnity and fuzzy logic controllers for the automobile ABS. Farhad Assadian, Centre Technique PSA ( Peugeot-Citroen ). A mixed of two different control strategies are proposed for sta- bility and performance enhancement of the vehicle Antilock Brak- ing Systems (ABS). The first is based on the H-infinity control the- ory in order to devise a robust control methodology for stabilizing the system under various road conditions. The second is based on the Fuzzy Logic concept for performance enhancement of the afore- mentioned system. The results of the mixed controllers are com- pared to the ideal condition for which access to the maximum tire- road coefficient of friction is available. 2001-01-0595. (SP- 1576) A model-based brake pressure esti- mation strategy for traction control system. Qingyuan Li, Keith W. Beyer, and Quan Zheng, Delphi Automotive Systems. This paper presents a brake pressure estimation algorithm for Delphi Traction Control Systems (TCS). A control-oriented lumped parameter model of a brake control system is developed using Matlab/Simulink. The model is derived based on a typical brake sys- tem and is generic to other types of brake control hardware systems. For application purposes, the model is simplified to capture the dominant dynamic brake pressure response. Vehicle experimental data collected under various scenarios are used to validate the algo- rithm. Simulation results show that the algorithm gives accurate pressure estimation. In addition, the calibration procedure is greatly simplified. 2001-01-0596. (SP- 1576) Comparison of control methods for electric vehicle antilock braking/traction control systems. P. Khatun, C. M. Bingham, and P. H. Mellor, University of Sheffield. The alleviation of environmental problems associated with per- sonal, public and commercial transport in urban areas has become an important issue for both policy makers and the automotive indus- try. Future legislation in Europe and the USA is expected to intro- duce strict limits in vehicle emissions, and both electric and hybrid vehicles are considered to be strong contenders for meeting low/zero emissions targets. As a result, research into electrically driven powertrains, which have similar performance attributes as ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles, has led to the development of electrically actuated wheel technologies, with increasing attention being focused on research into novel antilock braking/traction con- trol (ABS/TCS) strategies. This paper describes a comparison of traction control schemes using real-time observer based estimates of jLi-slip characteristics. In particular, a 'bang-bang' type strategy will be evaluated against fuzzy-based control schemes to facilitate torque production from the powertrain to produce optimal traction. Simulation studies and experimental trials on a laboratory test facility and simulation studies on a prototype electric vehicle will be used to evaluate and compare the response of the proposed tech- niques in real driving situations. Furthermore, the paper will demonstrate that the application of observer techniques are appropriate for the on-line determination of the peak adhesion coefficient for different tire-road surface condi- tions, and the fuzzy-based techniques offer substantial potential for optimal control of wheel traction. 2001-01-0598. (SP- 1576) The development and testing of a prototype electromagnetic ABS for drum brakes. J. Andrew Rid- nour and Frank H. Speckhart, University of Tennessee. This paper describes a new design for ABS drum brakes. The design uses some components associated with electric trailer brakes. Similar to electric trailer brakes, a cam is rotated by the friction force of an electromagnet acting on the brake drum. The cam releases the brakes in proportion to the rotation of the cam. The design has the advantage of providing proportional reduction in brake torque and fast response times. Expensive components such as pumps are not required and no pedal vibration is introduced. Test data and testing procedure is included. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0599. (SP- 1576) An investigation into fuzzy control for anti-lock braking system based on road autonomous identifi- cation. Li Jun, Zhang Jianwu, and Yu Fan, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ. Automatic identification of road profiles ensures primarily right working condition of an anti-lock braking system (ABS). This paper presents a practical strategy to identify road conditions according to braking pressure, wheel slip ratio and angular deceleration. A fuzzy controller is designed to follow the target wheel slip ratio deter- mined by road conditions. Simulation tests have been undertaken respectively on single and variable adhesion road surfaces by using a 7-DOF nonlinear vehicle model, accounting for nonlinearity of suspension and tire. It is shown that the ABS fuzzy controller can identify changes of road conditions precisely and therefore modulate the control scheme, so as to obtain the maximum road friction and good lateral stability. In comparison with a conventional PID con- troller, the present fuzzy controller possesses of more robustness and better performance. 2001-01-0602.

The main contribution is the on-line estimation of the tire force which is needed for control. The concept of relaxation length describes the wheel-slip variation as a first-order model. From this 83</page><page sequence="83">2001-01-0602-2001-01-0610 concept a differential equation of tire force is proposed to design a controller based on nonlinear observer. Only longitudinal dynamics are considered in this study. Stability analysis in closed-loop is proved by Lyapunov's method. Sufficient conditions for applying sliding mode based control are derived. The proposed control is ver- ified through one-wheel simulation using "Magic formula" tire model. The robustness of control is tested by including errors in the parameters and by changing value of tire adhesion. A comparison of the proposed approach of control with PD control is given. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0603.

Christian BUrgy and James H. Garrett @aJr., Carnegie Mellon Univ.; Markus Klausner, Robert Bosch Corp.; and Jürgen Anlauf and Günter Nobis, Robert Bosch GmbH. Vehicle inspection in repair shops is often still based on paper forms. Information Technology (IT) does not yet support the entire inspection process. In this paper, we introduce a small wearable IT device that is controlled by speech and enables service technicians to wirelessly access relevant data and to perform on-site communi- cation. Users can carry this device in a pocket and use a small head- set to enter speech and receive audio feedback. This system provides a completely speech-enabled functionality and thus offers a hands- free operation. After showing the applicability of wearable comput- ers in this environment, we developed a proprietary hardware sys- tem consisting of a thin-client connected via a Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) link to a standard Personal Computer (PC) that runs a speech engine and hosts a database. Sev- eral field tests in garages helped us during the evolution of our pro- totypes where service technicians critiqued the prototypes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0607. New serviceability metrics for future design programs. Brian L. Torma, DaimlerChrysler Corp.

Influence of nozzle geometry on spray atom- ization and shape for port fuel injector. Wei-Min Ren and Hamid Sayar, Siemens AG. Understanding the disintegration process and geometric effects on spray characteristics are of importance in the design of a high quality injector, because improving fuel atomization and targeting has been proved to be an effective way to reduce the exhaust hydro- carbon emissions for gasoline engines. To reveal the relationship between the internal flow and the spray characteristics, particle size measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were combined to analyze a set of orifices. The flow field inside the nozzle, as well as the direction and shape of the liquid jet in the vicinity of the nozzle exit, was numerically pre- dicted. Spray droplet sizes were then measured for the same orifices. Interesting links were discovered between nozzle geometry and spray characteristics. The results indicate that the secondary flow inside the orifice hole, due to Vena Contracta phenomena, contrib- utes greatly to the atomization and shape of the liquid jets. Atomiza- tion quality can be significantly improved by controlling the orifice hole location and its length to diameter ratio (L/D). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0609. Implementation of fuel film compensation algorithm on the Lamborghini Diablo 6.0 engine. Nicolò Cavina and Giorgio Minelli, University of Bologna; and Massimo Cecca- rani, Automobili Lamborghini. This paper presents the experimental work and the results obtained from the implementation of a transient fuel compensation algorithm for the 6.0-liter VI 2 high-performance engine that equips the Lamborghini Diablo vehicles. This activity has been carried out as part of an effort aimed at the optimization of the entire fuel injec- tion control system. In the first part of the paper the tests for fuel film compensator identification are presented and discussed. In this phase the experi- mental work has been conducted in the test cell. An automatic cali- bration algorithm was developed to identify the well-known fuel film model X and x parameters, so as to define their maps as a func- tion of engine speed and intake manifold pressure. The influence of engine coolant temperature has been investigated separately; it will be soon presented together with the air dynamics compensation algorithm. In the second part of the paper, the performance of the fuel dynamics compensation algorithm is analyzed. The measured Air-Fuel Ratio (AFR) distribution, especially during selected por- tions of the USA driving cycle, has been chosen as a yardstick to evaluate the performance improvement of the new injection control strategy. The experimental tests have been conducted using Lam- borghini' s chassis dynamometer laboratory. The comparison between the AFR values, measured before and after the introduction of the new strategy using a linear oxygen sensor, clearly shows the efficiency gain in terms of AFR control due to the transient fuel compensation algorithm. 2001-01-0610. Stratification of in-cylinder mixture distribu- tions by tuned port injection in a 4-valve SI gas engine. Tadao Yamato, Hirofumi Sekino, Tomohiro Ninomiya, and Masaru Hayashida, Kubota Corp. In order to realize the stratification of mixture within a port injec- tion gas engine, an experimental engine having two intake ports (i.e., swirl and straight port) per cylinder was prepared and investi- gations were made to see the effect of injection position on in- cylinder fuel distribution. To understand the flow within the engine, CFD calculation and PIV measurement were carried out and the effects were examined. Also firing tests and the measurement of in- cylinder fuel distribution by LIF method were conducted with the various injection positions to verify the predictions. As a result, it was found that the performance of the engine was affected by the injection position and proper charge stratification was realized by injection into a certain area of the intake port. 84</page><page sequence="84">2001-01-0612-2001-01-0622 2001-01-0612.

One of the key elements of vehicle safety requires a constantly uninterrupted visible view especially during unexpected weather conditions. Our present development of a light reflection type rain sensor is a key device of our automatic windshield wiper system. The design concept of the sensor is based on the quantification on both detected rainfalls and wiping modes in order to match the wiping mode in an operator's mind by optimizing the optical sensing system and establishing an algorithm for controlling wiping. In addition, auto- initialization of the system has been achieved first in the world. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0613.

George Saikalis and Shigeru Oho , Hitachi America , Ltd.; Takashi Kadohiro , Hitachi Automotive Products (USA), Inc.; and Kimitaka Yamane, Musashi Institute of Technology. A new hydrogen flow sensor was designed and evaluated based on the concept of hot wire anemometry. This sensor is designed to measure the mass flow rate of hydrogen gas used in (but not limited to) proton exchange fuel cell, PEFC. The conceptual evaluation was initiated by deriving an electro-thermal model of the hot wire required for sensing hydrogen velocity. The modeling is done via a mechatronics software tool, Saber™. This model was validated using air as a medium. Simulated and experimental performance results and safety issues are presented and discussed in this paper. Fail-safe methods and effectiveness have been investigated along with hydrogen ignition temperatures with varying hydrogen- to- air ratios. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0614. (SP- 1609) A nozzle-integrated flow sensor for common-rail injection systems. U. Schmid, G. Krötz, H. Öing, and G. Renner, DaimlerChrysler AG; and D. Schmitt-Landsiedel, Tech- nical University Munich. We are the first to report about a micromachined flow sensor directly integrated in the Common Rail injection nozzle body between the double guidance and the tip of the nozzle. The thermal measurement principle is chosen, because it enables a very precise and fast detection of gaseous and liquid mass flows. Additionally, the velocity field in the nozzle is only slightly influenced by the inte- gration of the sensor in the nozzle body due to the negligible height of the sensitive layer. For a hot film anemometer, a high pressure stable ceramic substrate can be used, fabricated in a low cost batch process. The technology, to fabricate the sensor, as well as the first flow measurements, carried out at a high pressure test set up, are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0615. Impact identification using smart material sensors. Saravana M. Peelamedu and Nagi G. Naganathan, Univer- sity of Toledo. The crash performance of an automobile largely depends on the ability to identity impact damage, maintain the passenger safety through deployment of various safety restraint systems, and steer away the vehicle from impact. So, this work is focused on the impact response of an automobile structure so as to find the location, mag- nitude of impact and asses the severity of damage. The results of the developed generalized forward plate model compared within 2% for FEM and previous other theoretical approaches. The inverse model compared within 7% for location and reconstructed force. Damage severity assessment is also investigated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0616.

(SP- 1609) Magnetostrictive dynamic strain sensor. Mehmet H. Uras, Lawrence Technological Univ. The Magnetostrictive Dynamic Strain Sensor is a permanent- magnet constant-flux excitation sensor and thus requires no other electrical excitation or power source. It does not require any signal conditioning. Since it is a constant-flux dynamic sensor, it does not generate any offset voltage and it does not exhibit temperature or drift problems. Furthermore, the sensor is rugged, simple and inex- pensive. The sensor's time-averaged output is constantly zero. The sensor detects only dynamic events such as impact, crash, firing (or misfir- ing) of an engine cylinder, piston slap, vibrations of a machine com- ponent, vehicles passing through a bridge, etc. Therefore, the sensor has many promising automotive applications including crash and misfire detection. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0618.

Several shortcomings of mechanical door checks are overcome using a magnetorheological damper. Because the damper is electri- cally actuated, it can check in any desired position. The logical deci- sion to activate or release the door check can be made either by pas- sive circuitry based on input signals from switches attached to door handles or under microprocessor control, in which case the decision can take into account a variety of unconventional input factors, including the magnitude of the force applied to the door, the rate of change of the applied force, and the angle of door opening. With the addition of an appropriate proximity sensor, the controllable damper can prevent the door from inadvertently hitting a nearby obstacle. Details of the damper mechanism are described, and several imple- mented control strategies, both passive and microprocessor based, are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0622.

(SP- 1579) The influence of an oil recycler on emissions with oil age for a refuse truck using in service testing. Gordon E. Andrews and Hu Li , University of Leeds; and J. Hall , A. A. Rahman , and P. Mawson , Top High UK Ltd. A method of cleaning lubricating oil on line was investigated using a fine bypass particulate filter followed by an infra red heater. Two bypass filter sizes of 6 and 1 micron were investigated, both filter sizes were effective but the one micron filter had the greatest benefit. This was tested on two nominally identical EURO 1 emis- sions compliance refuse trucks, fitted with Perkins Phazer 210TÌ 6 liter turbocharged intercooled engines and coded as RT320 and RT321. These vehicles had emissions characteristics that were sig- nificantly different, in spite of their similar age and total mileage. RT321 showed an apparent heavier black smoke than RT320. Com- parison was made with the emissions on the same vehicles and engines with and without the on-line bypass oil recycler. Engine exhaust emissions were measured about every 400 miles. Both vehi- cles started the test with an oil drain and fresh lubricating oil. The two refuse trucks were tested in a different sequence, the RT320 without the recycler fitted and then fitted later and the RT321 with the recycler fitted and then removed later in the test and both without any oil change. The RT320 was also the one with the finer bypass filter. The test mileage was nearly 8,000 miles both trucks. The air/ fuel ratio was worked out by the exhaust gas analysis. The correla- tion between air/fuel ratio and emission parameters was determined and appropriate corrections were made in the case of that the air/fuel ratio had an effect on emissions. The results showed that the on line oil recycler cleaning system can reduce the rate of increase of the NOx with oil age. There appeared little influence of the oil recycler on carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. The rate of increase in particulate emissions was reduced by 50% for RT320 and an immediate decrease in particulate emissions was seen on RT320 test after fitting the recycler. The black smoke was reduced by 30% for RT320 in terms average value and an immediate decrease in smoke after fitting the recycler on RT320 test and an immediate increase in smoke after the removal of the recycler on RT321 test were shown. 2001-01-0625.

Bert Bras , Scott Duncan , Matt Franz, Tom Graver, Yong-Hee Han, Leon McGinnis, Sandra Velasquez, Brian Wilgenbusch, and Chen Zhou, Georgia Institute of Technology; and Dave Gustashaw, Inter- face Americas, Inc. In this paper, we describe our work and experiences with inte- grating environmental and economic performance monitoring in a production facility of Interface Flooring Systems, Inc. The objective of the work is to create a "dashboard" that integrates environmental and economic monitoring and assessment of manufacturing pro- cesses, and provides engineers and managers an easy to use tool for obtaining valid, comparable assessment results that can be used to direct attention towards necessary changes. To this purpose, we build upon existing and familiar cost management principles, in par- ticular Activity-Based Costing and Management (ABC &amp; ABM), and we extend those into environmental management in order to obtain a combined economic and environmental performance mea- surement framework (called Activity-Based Cost and Environmen- tal Management). Furthermore, we enhance the response time of performance measurements by integrating data gathering capabili- ties from manufacturing process sensors. In this paper, we describe our motivation for this approach, as well as the lessons learned in the implementation. 2001-01-0626. (SP- 1600) Pressure-sensitive paint technology applied to low-speed automotive testing. Edward Duell, Sverdrup Technology, Inc.; Douglas Everstine, Ford Motor Co.; Rabindra Mehta and James Bell, NASA Ames Research Center; and Mark Perry, Lockheed Martin Low Speed Wind Tunnel. Pres sure- sensitive paint (PSP) technology is a technique used to experimentally determine surface pressures on models during wind tunnel tests. The key to this technique is a specially formulated pres- sure-sensitive paint that responds to, and can be correlated with the local air pressure. Wind tunnel models coated with pressure- sensitive paint are able to yield quantitative pressure data on an entire model surface in the form of light intensity values in recorded images. Quantitative results in terms of pressure coefficients (Cp) are obtained by correlating PSP data with conventional pressure tap data. Only a small number of surface taps are needed to be able to obtain quantitative pressure data with the PSP method. This tech- nique is gaining acceptance so that future automotive wind tunnel tests can be done at reduced cost by eliminating most of the expen- sive pressure taps from wind tunnel models. A significant advantage of PSP is a much higher spatial resolution mapping of the pressure field than that given by the discrete data available from pressure taps, even when the taps are closely spaced. Experiments were conducted with the main objective of deter- mining whether PSP could produce useful results on an automotive model at low test velocities. These wind tunnel tests were performed on a 4/10 scale 1995 Ford Transit van. Results were obtained throughout the yaw range of -15° to +15° and between dynamic pressures of 16 psf and 60 psf (766 Pa and 2872 Pa). At higher dynamic pressures (above 40 psf or 1914 Pa), the PSP measure- ments can determine the model surface pressure distribution with 'reasonable' (±0.2 Cp with 95% confidence) quantitative accuracy. At lower dynamic pressures, the images have lower signal-to-noise ratios and thus decreased quantitative accuracy. However, the basic trends in the data seen at high dynamic pressures are also evident at low dynamic pressures. This indicates that PSP measurements are capable of qualitatively determining the model surface pressure dis- tribution at dynamic pressures as low as 16 psf (766 Pa). PSP tech- nology was also demonstrated to be very useful for flow diagnostics. A-pillar vortex regions, separated flow regions behind 'backward- facing steps,' flow reattachment lines, and the effects of model changes and yaw angle could be identified from the PSP results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0627. (SP- 1600) Pressure-sensitive paint for automo- tive aerodynamics. Jean-Luc Aider and Laurent Elena, PSA Peug- eot Citroen; and Yves Le Sant, Florence Bouvier, Marie-Claire Merienne, and Jean-Luc Peron, ONERA. Measurement of static pressure over an automotive body is tedious work. The preparation of the model can be long and the spa- tial resolution in high curvature regions, where separations occur, is poor. To overcome these intrinsic drawbacks it is necessary to use another non-intrusive experimental technique. We show in this paper that the Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) fulfills the require- ments and is reliable for automotive applications. We consider a simplified 1/4-scale model of a Peugeot 206 with a modified back slant to enhance the longitudinal vortices. The PSP measurements are compared to standard pressure ports measurements and to CFD computations. We find good quantitative agreement between pres- sure ports and PSP measurements and a good qualitative and quanti- tative agreement between PSP and the computations over the entire slant surface. The high spatial resolution and high sensitivity of this technique allows very good description of the flow over any com- plex surfaces even at low velocity. Considering that PSP does not need any particular instrumentation of the car, it is well adapted to the constraints of the automotive industry and appears to be a very attractive improvement of the traditional pressure taps. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 86</page><page sequence="86">2001-01-0622-2001-01-0633 2001-01-0628.

Velocity profiles for air flowing under a vehicle body are deter- mined by analyzing videotapes of neutrally buoyant soap bubbles using motion analysis software and equipment. What had heretofore been primarily a qualitative flow visualization technique has been extended to provide quantitative data. The light sources, cameras, and bubble generator, mounted on the vehicle, are powered by the vehicle's electrical system, making it possible to compare under- body velocities measured in a wind tunnel with those over the road. Results are presented for a heavy-duty 4x4 pickup truck at speeds up to 25 m/s (55 mph). The velocity profiles in the tunnel and on the road were quite similar. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0629. (SP- 1600) Hyundai full-scale aero-acoustic wind tunnel. Moo-Sang Kim, Jung-Ho Lee, Jung-Do Kee, and Jin- Hyuck Chang, Hyundai Motor Co. A new Hyundai Aero-acoustic Wind Tunnel (HAWT) has been opened in the Nam-yang Technical Center of Hyundai Motor Com- pany (HMC) since August 1999. This wind tunnel has a 3/4 semi- open jet test section and a closed circuit in order to improve aerody- namic and wind noise and thermodynamic characteristics of vehi- cles. The HMC technical center had started the feasibility study of full-scale wind tunnel in 1995, to improve the aerodynamic charac- teristics and to meet fuel consumption regulations. The main pur- pose of this facility is conduct various kinds of tests on customer driving conditions, including aerodynamic and aero-acoustic tests and engine cooling simulations, etc. The technical specification was made on the basis of HMC engineers' experience of their own model scale and full-scale wind tunnels (like MIRA or DNW) dur- ing last 10 years. After two years of feasibility studies, a basic design, detailed design work, and the on-site construction work started from spring 1997 and finished at the end of January 1999. After the construction was completed, the commissioning test was started and finished at the end of July 1999. In this paper, the wind tunnel design, development procedure, technical specification, and commissioning test results are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0630.

This paper describes a program of coastdown and wind tunnel tests conducted with the objective of establishing a correlation between the aerodynamic drag force measured at the Lockheed- Martin Low-Speed Wind Tunnel (LSWT) and that inferred from coastdown results on the test track. The result of this correlation establishes, in principle, the capability to project what the aerody- namic drag force inferred by a future coastdown test will be (for a future, as-yet unavailable property) based on a current database of wind tunnel results. The correlation is accompanied by a rigorous uncertainty analysis to assess the quality of the correlation and its supporting data. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0631. (SP-1600) Effect of test section configuration on aerodynamic drag measurements. Jeffrey Hoffman, Bill Mar- tindale, and Stephen Arnette, Sverdrup Technology, Inc.; and Jack Williams, and Stan Wallis, Ford Motor Co. Aerodynamic measurements in automotive wind tunnels are degraded by test section interference effects, which increase with increasing vehicle blockage ratio. The current popularity of large vehicles (i.e., trucks and sport utility vehicles) makes this a signifi- cant issue. This paper describes the results of an experimental inves- tigation carried out in support of the Ford/Sverdrup Driveability Test Facility (DTF), which includes an aero-acoustic wind tunnel (Wind Tunnel No. 8). The objective was to quantify the aerody- namic interference associated with two candidate test section con- figurations for Wind Tunnel No. 8-semi-open jet and slotted wall. The experiments were carried out at 1/11 -scale in Sverdrup labora- tories. Four automobile shapes (MIRA models) and six Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) shapes representing blockages from 7% to 25% were used to evaluate changes in measured aerodynamic coefficients for the two test section configurations. This blockage range is appropri- ate for the 200ft2 nozzle in Wind Tunnel No. 8. All results were obtained at zero model yaw, over a Reynolds number range of 7x1 05 to lxlO6 based on model length. In addition to the open jet and slot- ted wall measurements, Sverdrup' s sub-scale adaptive wall tunnel was used to acquire additional reference data. The results highlight the influence of test section configuration on aerodynamic measure- ments. Drag results are presented here, respective of their impor- tance to automotive development. For the MIRA models, the refer- ence results compare well to those from independent experiments. Comparison of the open jet, slotted wall, and reference results shows the open jet offers less aerodynamic interference than the slotted wall. This, coupled with the acoustic advantages of an open jet, drove the decision to strictly employ an open jet configuration in Wind Tunnel No. 8. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0632. (SP-1600) Practical application of the two- variable blockage correction method to automobile shapes. Robert Ranzenbach, Jewel B. Barlow, and Hossein Esmaili, Univer- sity of Maryland. The flow conditions in a closed test section wind tunnel are not the same as in freestream due in part to the constraints imposed by the wind tunnel walls. Boundary correction methods can be applied to wind tunnel results to estimate the effects of wind tunnel wall constraints. One such scheme, the two- variable method, which is a measurement-based scheme used to estimate a particular class of wind tunnel wall constraints known as solid and wake blockage, is described herein. The Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel (GLMWT) has implemented the two-variable method and has applied it previously for large models in a variety of applications, primarily in the evalua- tion of yacht's offwind sail performance. This paper describes the application of the two-variable method to simplified fastback style three-dimensional automobile shapes at zero yaw angle. Models ranged in size from 2.75% to 5.53% of the tunnel's cross- sectional area. The results obtained using this method are compared to the results obtained when using two other commonly applied blockage correction schemes, namely the continuity method and the area ratio method. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0633. (SP-1600) On the application of classical wind tunnel corrections for automotive bodies. Gerhard Wickern, AUDI AG. The classical theory of wind tunnel corrections calculated from potential flow theory is revisited. In this context a flow model uni- formly valid for all types of test sections is developed for the correc- tion of drag in automotive wind tunnels. To define and size the sin- gularities setting up the flow model only geometrical properties of the model and measured force coefficients will be used. To achieve a correct representation of the flow about a vehicle body a number of improvements to the classical approach are proposed. Based on the uniformly valid flow model, correction formulae for closed wall, open jet and slotted wall test sections are given. For the open jet and slotted wall case it is shown, that the presented formulae are still incomplete, whereas for the closed wall case the correction is ready to use. The correction approach is validated step by step by compari- son with appropriate experimental data. Possible benefit of the correction is not only the ability to correct for unwanted wall interference effects, but also an improved under- standing of wind tunnel test section design items. This can be uti- lized for an optimized design for new tunnels as well as for improve- ments of existing facilities. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 87</page><page sequence="87">2001-01-0634-2001-01-0640 2001-01-0634. (SP-1578) Finite element shape optimization of a steering knuckle for a heavy truck - A case study. Murali M. R. Krishna , Dana Corp. A case study of the application of shape optimization techniques to reduce the weight of a steering knuckle of a heavy truck suspen- sion has been presented. Design analysts, who work with finite ele- ment shape optimization, face a daunting task while handling such complicated parts - uneven shape, multiple load cases and element distortions during shape optimization, etc. A baseline analysis con- firmed that the knuckle was overweight. A shape optimization anal- ysis was undertaken to bring down its weight and at the same time keep the stresses within design limits. A numerical interpolation method has been used to generate shape vectors. The weight of the knuckle was brought down by 12.7% and the final design was veri- fied using II order solid finite elements. 2001-01-0636. (SP-1578) Shape optimization of an exhaust system. Kendra Eads and Kamyar Haghighi, Purdue Univ.; and Joe Fuehne , ArvinMeritor Inc. Using a finite element approach, a technique for optimization of an exhaust system design was developed. This technique involved the creation of the parameterized model, implementation of the loading and finally the optimization of the model. In the creation of the finite element model, pipe elements were used. Parameters were assigned to the structure using coordinate relations between nodes, instead of the positions of the nodes in coordinate space. The model was then verified using modal analysis. A random vibration analysis was used as a loading criterion for the model, as well as static gravi- tational loading. The optimization of the design focused primarily on the shape characteristics of the structure and secondarily on each component thickness. Using only thickness parameters, a 15% reduction of the weight of the system was achieved, with an addi- tional 2-3% decrease in weight possible through shape optimization. 2001-01-0637.

The integrated process of UG, ICEMCFD, and FLUENT was accomplished using iSIGHT for vehicle Aero/Thermal applications. Process integration, CFD solu- tion strategy, optimization algorithm and the practicality for real- world problem of this process have been studied, and will be dis- cussed in this paper. As an example of this application, the results of an underhood thermal design will be presented. The advantage of systematical and rapid design exploration is demonstrated by using this integrated process.

(SP-1578) A modeling approach on modeling of nonlinear system for functional development of automobile. Shizuo Sumida, CATEC, Inc.; and Masao Nagamatsu, Hokkaido Institute of Technology. To shorten the term of automobile development, recently the numerical experimental system are focused as the compensation methods of real experimentations. These systems are based on the accurate modeling method, and simulate actual motions of mecha- nism sufficiently accurate to predict the results of actual experimen- tation and to be the alternative of it. The automobile mechanisms involve various nonlinearity in its motion because of its complex mechanic structure, fluid existence and thermo utilization nature. Therefore the modeling method applied to automobile mechanism is particularly required the accu- racy on nonlinear action. There were mainly two modeling methods well known. One is the Bondgraph method which simulates energy flow of dynamic system. As the all-physical phenomenon is recognized as embodi- ment of energy behavior, this method is to be excellent in accuracy as calculation of physical phenomenon. However this method is generally poor at representing complex mechanism in detail because of its rough notation. Another method is commercial software widely spread. This method has notation code consisting of the com- ponents representing simple mathematical calculations, therefore is adaptable for various phenomenon. However this method is regard- less of energy flow. This means incomplete modeling of physical phenomenon. In this method, a phenomenon may be represented as the change of one visually measurable value. It will be insufficient to analyze the physical phenomenon particularly if the phenomenon make the supply or loss of energy, it frequently occurs in nonlinear process. To overcome this dilemma, the new method, Functional Model- ing Method is formerly proposed. This method has detailed notation code like conventional commercial software, and also is regardful of energy flow. In this paper, the solution of how to describe the nonlinear phe- nomenon precisely without physical abstraction is explained. Fur- thermore the examples of solution of modeling about actual automo- bile mechanisms are presented. 2001-01-0639. Accounting for the effects of induction harden- ing in the modeling of automotive parts. Philippe B. Auburtin and Joseph Fansi, PSA Peugeot Citroën ; and Cyril Legiot, Systus Inter- national. This paper describes a method to account for the effects of induc- tion hardening in computer simulation of automotive parts. This method, which is currently being used at PSA Peugeot-Citro%n, enables the rapid optimization of shapes and heat treatments (usu- ally for weight reduction purposes). It is a two-stage method. The first stage is based on simple topological geometries accounting for the heat treatment, which are implemented directly in the finite ele- ment model Abaqus®. This first stage allows for a succession of quick iterations. The second stage of the method consists of linking the various relevant process simulation softwares (Forge3®, Sysweld®, etc.) and Abaqus®, in order to confirm the optimized shape and treatment obtained in the first stage. Simulation of trans- mission auto parts will be presented as illustrations of this method. 2001-01-0640. (SP-1614) Development of high corrosion resistant stainless steels for automotive mufflers based on con- densate corrosion test and field investigation. Junichiro Hira- sawa, Takumi U jiro, Susumu Satoh, and Osamu Furukimi, Kawa- saki Steel Corp. Automotive exhaust gas condensate causes severe corrosion inside mufflers. Corrosive condensate became a problem following the introduction of three-way catalytic converters in exhaust sys- tems. The authors previously established a new laboratory test method that simulates condensate corrosion. This test method con- tributed to the development of new stainless steels for automotive mufflers. The addition of molybdenum (Mo) and copper (Cu) to fer- ritic stainless steels was found to be effective in improving conden- sate corrosion resistance, and the effect was arranged using the index [%chromium (Cr)+3x%Mo+1.5x%Cu]. A field test was car- ried out to investigate the corrosion behavior of mufflers under actual conditions. Aluminized steels showed severe damage by gen- eral corrosion. On the other hand, 19%Cr-Cu ferritic stainless steel exhibited excellent corrosion resistance. The corrosion behavior in the field test showed good agreement with the results of the labora- tory test. Based on these results, Type 436L (18%Cr-1.2%Mo) and Type 430J1L (19%Cr-0.5%Cu) stainless steels were developed for muffler materials. 88</page><page sequence="88">200 1 -0 1 -0642-200 1 -0 1 -0648 2001-01-0642. (SP-1614) Thin walled steel tube pre-bending for hydroformed components - Bending boundaries and pre- sentation of a new mandrel design. Thomas Flehmig , Klaus W. Bliimel , and Martin Kibhen , ThyssenKrupp Stahl AG. For auto-body structures, thin- walled hydroformed and laser- beam-welded hollow steel sheet sections are recommended as a replacement for mainly spot-welded box-shape components. Such components have the same strength but a lighter weight. Pre-bending into the required shape prior to the hydroforming step is difficult to realize in the case of thin wall thicknesses in com- bination with small bending diameters and relatively large tube diameters. There are bending limits with respect to buckling or cracking which have still to be clearly defined. The boundaries for the cold rotary draw bending process are fixed in the so-called "bending diagram." This diagram in itself is insufficient. Based on simple equations in combination with numeri- cal calculations, an analytical equation was drawn up to better define the boundary conditions. This also takes into account the influence of the material. Furthermore, a new and low-cost mandrel is presented which enables the realization of the pre-bending process under extreme conditions. One of the characteristic features of such a bending man- drel is the in-line calibration of the tube to clamp very thin walls and eliminate the ovality. For example, we are currently working on tubes with an outer diameter of 60 mm, a wall thickness of 0.5 mm and a bending radius of 99 mm. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0644. (SP-1614) High-performance alternative to hexavalent chromium passivation of plated zinc and zinc alloys. Alan Gardner and John Scharf, MacDermid, Inc. Hexavalent chrome passivates have been used for improving the corrosion resistance of sacrificial zinc and zinc alloy coatings on fer- rous substrates for many years. However, forthcoming legislation and corporate policies are beginning to curtail the use of hexavalent chrome compounds and replacements are actively being sought. Comparative corrosion resistance data is presented here. The data shows that the corrosion resistance of the trivalent passivates do not significantly diminish after thermal shock, as is the case with hexavalent chromâtes. This makes it particularly suitable for com- ponents that are subjected to high ambient temperatures. No changes to the dimensional characteristics of the components occur. Recommended application areas include the engine compart- ment, brake components, fasteners of all sizes and fluid system com- ponents. When used in conjunction with certain final finishes, these hex- avalent chrome free passivates have the potential to replace more expensive alloy or dip spin type coatings. 2001-01-0645. Development of liquid surface conditioner. Nakayama Takaomi, Shimoda Kensuke, Takagi Yasushi, and Mat- sushita Tadashi, Nihon Parke rizing Co., Ltd. Conventional surface conditioners for use during zinc phosphat- ing of auto bodies use a Ti colloid. The Ti colloid is very effective as a surface conditioner, however due to the instability of the col- loid, the pH range and quality of water that can be used is limited. As a result of our substantial research on surface conditioners, we have succeeded in developing a completely new and improved sur- face conditioner. The new surface conditioner utilizes completely different components to the Ti colloid conditioner, exhibits a high degree of stability, and is far more effective in accelerating the pho- sphating reaction than the conventional conditioner. With the new conditioner it is possible to create extremely fine zinc phosphate crystals which could not have been created with the conventional technology, the zinc phosphating treatment time is shorter, pho- sphatability of difficult-to-treat substrates is improved and the pho- sphatability of the inside of box sections in auto bodies is also improved. Furthermore, due to the excellent stability of the new sur- face conditioner, the effectiveness of the conditioner is not affected by the quality of the water used in the surface conditioner bath. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0646. A vehicle micro corrosion environmental study of field and proving ground tests. Tie Wang, Guilian Gao, John Bomback, and Mark Ricketts, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents the progress of an ongoing vehicle micro cor- rosion environment study. The goal of the study is to develop an improved method for estimating vehicle corrosion based on the Total Vehicle Accelerated Corrosion Test at the Arizona Proving Ground (APG). Although the APG test greatly accelerates vehicle corrosion compared to the field, the "acceleration factor" varies con- siderably from site-to-site around the vehicle. This method accounts for the difference in corrosivity of various local corrosion environ- ments from site-to-site at APG and in the field. Correlations of vehi- cle microenvironments with the macroenvironment (weather) and the occurrence of various environmental conditions at microen- vironments are essential to the study. A comparison of results from APG versus field measurements generated using a cold-rolled-steel- based corrosion sensor is presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0647. (SP- 1608) Effects of alternative fuels and intake port geometry on HSDI diesel engine performance and emissions. Daniel D. Corgard and RolfD. Reitz, University of Wis- consin. This research explored methods to reduce regulated emissions in a small-bore, direct-injection diesel engine. Swirl was used to influ- ence mixing of the spray plumes, and alternative fuels were used to study the effects of oxygenated and water microemulsion diesel fuels on emissions. Air/fuel mixing enhancement was achieved in the running engine by blocking off a percentage of one of the two intake ports. The swirl was characterized at steady-state conditions with a flowbench and swirl meter. Swirl ratios of 1.85, 2.70, and 3.29 were studied in the engine tests at full load with engine speeds of 1303, 1757, and 1906 rev/min. Increased swirl was shown to have negative effects on emissions due to plume-to-plume interactions. Blends of No. 2 diesel and biodiesel were used to investigate the presence of oxygen in the fuel and its effects on regulated emissions. Pure No. 2 diesel fuel, a 15% and a 30% biodiesel blend (by weight) were used. The effects were investigated at full load with engine speeds of 1303 and 1757 rev/min and a swirl ratio of 1.85. The results showed that the particulate emissions were reduced signifi- cantly with the use of oxygen in the fuel. A study was also per- formed using a water-diesel microemulsion fuel to assess the poten- tial for additional NOx reduction of advanced fuels compared to a California Reference diesel fuel. The microemulsion contained 10% by volume, 20-30 nm diameter water droplets, and was run at part and full loads at 1757 rev/min. The results overall showed great reductions in regulated emissions, indicating that this new fuel con- cept holds significant promise for future applications. 2001-01-0648.

Experiments to study the effects of oxygenated fuels on emis- sions and combustion were performed in a single-cylinder direct- injection (DI) diesel engine. A matrix of oxygen-containing fuels assessed the impact of weight percent oxygen content, oxygenate chemical structure, and oxygenate volatility on emissions. Several oxygenated chemicals were blended with an ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel and evaluated at an equivalent energy release and combustion phasing. Additional experiments investigated the effectiveness of oxygenated fuels at a different engine load, a matched fuel/air equiv- alence ratio, and blended with a diesel fuel from the Fischer-Tropsch process. Interactions between emissions and critical engine operat- ing parameters were also quantified. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was used to evaluate particle size distributions, in 89</page><page sequence="89">2001-01-0648-2001-01-0653 addition to particulate matter (PM) filter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) measurements. The oxygenated diesel fuels were found to decrease the volume fraction of particles, but did not alter the total number of particles emitted. The reduction was a function of the fuel's weight percent oxygen content and oxygen containing functional group. Agreement was achieved between the relative trends observed with the inte- grated SMPS particle volume fraction and filter-based mass mea- surement. Preliminary physical and chemical characterization of particulate matter from the reference and oxygenated fuels did not reveal any significant morphological or compositional differences. 2001-01-0649. (SP- 1608) Reduction of NOx and smoke emis- sions in a diesel engine fueled by biodiesel emulsion combined with EGR. Yasufumi Yoshimoto and Hiroya Tamaki, Niigata Insti- tute of Technology. Transesterified fuels (biodiesel fuels; BDF) from vegetable oils are alternative fuels for diesel engines, they are renewable and offer potential reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Many studies have reported that exhaust from BDF has equal or higher NOx concentra- tions while HC and PM emissions are significantly lower than with gas oil. The aim of the present investigation is to achieve drastic reductions in NOx emissions. Performance tests of a single-cylinder DI diesel engine were conducted using water-emulsified fuels from BDF and gas oil with varying water addition rates combined with cooled EGR. The result showed that at a rated output, the emulsified gas oil with water to base fuel volume ratio of 30% reduced NOx (from 1020ppm) to 190ppm with the 21% EGR condition maintain- ing the minimum BSEC value achieved with EGR free gas oil oper- ation. However, the smoke density increased by 28%. The combined operation of 21% EGR and emulsified BDF with 30% water showed significant reductions in NOx (to 170ppm) without worsening smoke emissions, although the BSEC increased by 4%. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0650. (SP- 1608) The emissions performance of oxy- genated diesel fuels in a prototype DI diesel engine. David L. Hil- den, General Motors Research and Development Center ; and John C. Eckstrom and Leslie R. Wolf BP. As part of a cooperative development program, six diesel fuels (a reference and five blends containing oxygenates) were evaluated under four steady-state conditions using a prototype 1.26-L 3-cylin- der four-valve common-rail DI diesel engine. All of the fuels con- tained low sulfur (mostly &lt; 5 ppm by mass), and they were chosen to determine the impacts of oxygenate volatility, concentration, and chemical type (paraffinic or aromatic) on exhaust emissions - with particular emphasis on particulate emissions. In addition to HC, CO, NOx and PM emissions measurements, emissions of the volatile portion of the PM and particle size were determined. Relative to the very low sulfur reference fuel, the oxygenated fuels reduced PM and NOx under some operating conditions, but produced little effect on either HC or CO emissions. Aliphatic oxygenates at 6 wt. percent oxygen in the reference fuel reduced simulated FTP PM emissions by 15 - 27 %. Of the variables studied, EGR level generally affected the particle size. The fuels, test protocol and results are described. Finally, significant differences in fuel effects are reported on the basis of statistical analyses of the data. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0651. (SP- 1608) Comparison of heat release and NOx formation in a DI diesel engine running on DME and diesel fuel. Rolf Egnell, Lund Institute of Technology. Although there seems to be a consensus regarding the low emis- sion potential of DME, there are still different opinions about why the low NOx emissions can be obtained without negative effects on thermal efficiency. Possible explanations are: The physical proper- ties of DME affecting the spray and the mixture formation; Different shape and duration of the heat release in combination with reduced heat losses. In this paper an attempt is made to increase the knowledge of DME in relation to diesel fuel with respect to heat release and NOx formation. The emphasis has been to create injection conditions as similar as possible fdr both fuels. For that purpose the same injection system (CR), injection pressure (270 bar), injection timing and dura- tion have been used for the two fuels. The only differences were the diameters of the nozzle holes, which were chosen to give the same fuel energy supply, and the physical properties of the fuels. During the experiments, the start of injection was kept constant, and changing the time for the end of injection varied the duration. This was done in order to study the contribution of the total NOx and other emission at full load from the different stages of the com- bustion. The corresponding heat release rates were used as input to a zero-dimensional multizone combustion model where the local equivalence ratios were adapted so that the calculated NOx emis- sions corresponded with those measured. It was found that the general shape of the heat release rates was about the same for the two fuels. Emissions of CO and HC were higher and soot considerably higher with diesel fuel than with DME. Emissions of NOx were about the same, but the relation between the fuels varied with injection duration. The results from the calcula- tions with the multizone combustion model indicate that the average local equivalence ratio was quite high (&lt;]»1) and about the same for the two fuels. As the injection pressure used was considerably lower than normal for diesel fuel operation with a CR injection system, it is assumed that the mixing between the diesel fuel and air was worse than in the normal case. This is also manifested in the higher soot emissions. Thus one explanation why DME yields lower NOx emis- sions, as compared with diesel fuel injected at considerably higher pressures, is that the local equivalence ratio is higher, giving lower local oxygen concentration and NOx formation. Some differences between the two fuels were observed regarding the fuel injection. The needle opening speed was somewhat slower with DME and the amount of fuel injected at a given duration varied between the fuels. One reason for that was found to be throttling in the needle valve seat in the DME case. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0652. (SP- 1608) Development of a liquid-DME fuel tank - A two-fluid thermodynamic pump. James C. McCandless, Ho Teng, and Jeffrey B. Schneyer, AVL Powertrain Technologies, Inc. A novel fuel tank for storing liquid dimethyl ether (DME) has been developed. This fuel tank was made of cast aluminum with a water capacity of 40 liters. It contains two fluids: liquid DME and a vapor-liquid mixture of propane. A diaphragm separates the two fluids. The propane in the tank is a pressurizing fluid that pressurizes DME into a subcooled-liquid state; and, it also functions as a driving fluid that pumps the liquid DME from the tank to the injection pump using its vapor pressure. These features characterize the tank as a thermodynamic pump. Several hundred hours of tank tests at vari- ous temperatures have been conducted. Results of tank filling- discharge cycles simulating those in vehicle applications demon- strated that the concept of the two-fluid thermodynamic pump works and that the tank design is successful. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0653.

(SP- 1592) A comparison and model of NOx formation for diesel fuel and diethyl ether. Dale R. Tree , Brigham Young Univ.; and William B. Cooley, Ricks College. Exhaust NOx and particulate measurements were obtained at equivalent operating conditions in a direct-injection compression ignition engine for diesel and diethyl ether fuel. Particulate levels for diethyl ether were very low relative to the diesel fuel and did not increase significantly until the fuel to oxygen equivalence ratio was above 0.8. The log of fuel specific NOx for both the diesel and diethyl ether fuel were found to correlate well with the inverse of adiabatic flame temperature as has been observed by others in previ- ous research. A newly defined heat release averaged, adiabatic flame temperature improved the correlation of both fuels. Differ- ences in the correlations of the two fuels with this newly defined temperature were smaller than the scatter of the data. A simple model based on the assumptions of a NOx formation zone propor- tional in volume to the rate of heat release was successful at predict- ing fuel specific NOx over a range of simulated EGR conditions, speeds, and loads to within approximately ± 30%. The results sug- gest that the differences in NOx obtained with different fuels are a result of the fuels effect on flame temperature and not a fundamental change in kinetic reaction or mixing rates. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0655. (SP- 1592) Mechanism of the smokeless rich diesel combustion by reducing temperature. Kazuhiro Akihama, Yoshiki Takatori, and Kazuhisa Inagaki, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs. Inc.; Shizuo Sasaki, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Anthony M. Dean, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Co. Recently, the smokeless rich diesel combustion had been demon- strated. This can realize smokeless and NOx-less combustion by using a large amount of cooled EGR under a near stoichiometric and even in a rich operating condition. We focus on the effects of reduc- ing diesel combustion temperature on soot reduction. In this paper, the smoke suppression mechanism in the smokeless rich combus- tion, where the temperature is reduced by higher EGR rate, is ana- lyzed by the following procedure. ^(equivalence ratio) - T (temperature) map, which shows soot formation tendencies as a function of (1) and T, was made using zero- dimensional calculations with a detailed chemical kinetic model including PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) formation, soot particle nucleation, growth and surface oxidation. The combustion processes of the smokeless and conventional diesel combustion were simulated by the 3D-CFD KIVA2 code. In-cylinder conditions of smokeless and conventional combus- tion predicted by 3D-CFD were plotted on the &lt;|)-T map to investi- gate their behaviors and differences on the map. The following results were obtained, (a) According to 3D-CFD, there is little difference in mixture formation between the smokeless and conventional combustion. It is calculated that the temperature of the smokeless combustion with higher EGR rate is significantly reduced compared with that of conventional one. (b) The smokeless combustion proceeds so as to avoid soot formation regions on the &lt;|)-T map in contrast to the conventional one, due to this significant temperature reduction, (c) The smoke suppression is realized by the combustion taking place at temperatures below that needed to form soot. In such lower temperature region, the soot formation itself can be suppressed because the reactions forming soot particles from PAH do not progress even if the rich combustion occurs. This shows the reason why the smokeless rich combustion was realized without regard to the improvement of the mixture formation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0656.

Haj ime Ishii, Yuichi Goto, and Matsuo Odaka, Traf- fic Safety and Nuisance Research Institute; Andrei Kazakov, Prince- ton Univ.; and David E. Foster, University of Wisconsin. Simulations of DI diesel engine combustion have been per- formed using a modified KIVA-II package with a recently devel- oped phenomenological soot model. The phenomenological soot model includes generic description of fuel pyrolysis, soot particle inception, coagulation, and surface growth and oxidation. The com- putational results are compared with experimental data from a Cum- mins N14 single-cylinder test engine. Results of the simulations show acceptable agreement with experimental data in terms of cyl- inder pressure, rate of heat release, and engine-out NOx and soot emissions for a range of fuel injection timings considered. The numerical results are also post-processed to obtain time-resolved soot radiation intensity and compared with the experimental data analyzed using two-color optical pyrometry. The temperature mag- nitude and KL trends show favorable agreement. Then, simulation results have been visualized to present spatial distributions of tem- perature, fuel vapor, precursors, growth species, soot, and NOx. This visual interpretation of the model predictions is consistent with the experimental observations of diesel spray combustion reported by Dec in 1997. 2001-01-0657. (SP- 1592) Experimental investigation on soot and NOx formation in a DI common rail diesel engine with pilot injection. M. Badami, F. Millo, and D. D. D Amato, Politecnico di Torino. The influence of pilot injection timing and quantity on soot, NOx, combustion noise and bsfc has been analyzed on a passenger car DI diesel engine prototype equipped with a common rail fuel injection system. The investigated engine operating points were 1500/5, 2000/2, 2500/8 rpm/bar, which are quite typical of EC driving cycles. For each of these operating conditions, the pilot injection quantity was varied by up to 15% of the total injected quantity and the pilot injec- tion timing was varied between 32° and Io crank angle degrees. The principal combustion characteristics were determined on the basis of the heat release, and a thorough statistical analysis was per- formed to infer the correlation between the combustion parameters and soot and NOx emissions. The obtained results allow an evaluation of the impact of differ- ent injection strategies on the combustion process taking into account not only the thermodynamic effects of the pilot injection, but also the effects of the hydraulic and mechanical behavior of the injection system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0658. Innovative secondary air injection systems. Michael W. Kochs, Martin Kloda, and Guenter van de Venne, Pier- burg AG; and John E. Golden, Pierburg Inc. For years, secondary air injection systems have been used to reduce hydrocarbon exhaust emissions for a short period after engine cold start. In the beginning, passive secondary air systems were used, with the airflow driven by the pressure pulsations in the exhaust system. Since 1990, for most applications, active secondary air systems (i.e., systems where air is injected into the hot exhaust gases by a pump) have been employed. Secondary air injection into the hot exhaust gases is realized by a d-c motor driven turbine pump, i.e., a secondary air pump, and a control valve. Numerous factors, including raw engine emissions during cold start and warm up, driveability requirements and the need to adapt to different emissions legislation, dictate the use of secondary air injection systems. The development of other exhaust aftertreatment systems, e.g., close-coupled or heated catalysts as well as packaging and cost factors will influence the market penetration of secondary air systems. 91</page><page sequence="91">2001-01-0658-2001-01-0665 The transition from LEV to ULEV and from EU 3 to EU 4 will cause a considerable increase in the use of secondary air injection with port injection SI engines. The technical improvements of secondary air injection systems are mainly related to increased airflow performance and enhanced acoustical properties of the secondary air pumps. With a new type of secondary air valve, the number of system components and thus the system cost can be significantly reduced. A new demand- responsive secondary air pump allows further improvement in the efficiency of the exhaust after treatment and facilitates OBD by allowing direct verification of the secondary airflow rate. 2001-01-0659. Advanced low platinum group metal three- way catalysts for Tier 2 and LEV II compliance. Steve J. Golden, Andrew D. Polli, Randal Hatfield, Michael G. Cotton, and Timothy J. Truex, Catalytic Solutions, Inc. A breakthrough catalyst technology utilizing new mixed metal oxides in conjunction with Platinum Group Metals has been devel- oped. Stable synergies are designed into the catalyst washcoat that enable high performance and durability to be achieved at low Plati- num Group Metal usage. Extensive vehicle data is reported on cata- lysts aged using a variety of high-temperature accelerated aging cycles. Vehicle performance at the LEV, ULEV and LEV-II levels is discussed in the context of unique calibration-catalyst interac- tions. Conclusions concerning further areas of improvement and future applications are also reviewed. 2001-01-0660. Development of the automotive exhaust hydro- carbon adsorbent. Takaaki Kanazawa and Kazuhiro Sakurai, Toyota Motor Corp. The hydrocarbon adsorption volume character of zeolite was studied. Specifically, the relationship between aluminum content and zeolite hydrocarbon adsorption was investigated, as a potential hydrocarbon adsorbent for exhaust gas. The study also analyzed the relationship between hole diameter and zeolite hydrocarbon adsorp- tion. It was found that hydrocarbon adsorption increased with decreasing aluminum content. Zeolite with a pore size approxi- mately 0. 1 nm greater than the diameter of hydrocarbon molecules showed the best performance. Zeolites with two different pore sizes were mixed, and succeeded in adsorbing hydrocarbons of carbon number 3 and above. Silver (Ag) ion exchanged zeolite was also used to increase the adsorption of exhaust gas hydrocarbons, includ- ing those of carbon number 2. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0661. (SP- 1620) Finite element simulation and experimental validation of V-ribbed belt tracking. Minjie Xu, James B. Castle, Yuelin Shen, and K. Chandrashekhara, University of Missouri; and William F. Breig, and Larry R. Oliver, Dayco Products Inc. A general three-dimensional finite element model was built to simulate the tracking conditions inherent in automotive front-end accessory drives, specifically, serpentine V-ribbed belt drives. Com- mercial finite element code ABAQUS was used for the simulation. The analysis is based on a hyper-elastic material model for the belt, and includes the effect of the reinforced cords and fibers in the rub- ber compound. The model can be used to study different parameters of the belt drive system such as rib number, pulley misalignment, drive wrap angle and drive speed. Experiments were used to validate the finite element model. Belt misalignment force of two-, four- and six-ribbed belts under different misalignment conditions was obtained from experiment and compared with the results from the finite element model. Good correlation between these results brings confidence to the finite element model. Finally, typical FEA simula- tion results for a six-ribbed belt are presented. 2001-01-0662. (SP- 1620) Experimental modal analysis of automotive exhaust structures. Heiner Storck, Hartono Sumali, and Ya Pu, Purdue Univ. Experimental modal analysis (EMA) provides many parameters that are required in numerical modeling of dynamic and vibratory behavior of structures. This paper discusses EMA on an exhaust sys- tem of an off-road car. The exhaust structure is tested under three boundary conditions: free-free, supported with two elastomeric mounts, and mounted to the car. The free-free modal parameters are compared to finite element results. The two-mount tests are done with the mounts fixed to a rigid and heavy frame. The rigidity of the frame is verified experimentally. The on-car test is done with realistic boundary conditions, where the exhaust structure is fixed to the engine manifold as well as the two elastomeric mounts. The two-mount and the on-car tests result in highly complex mode shapes. Details discussed in the paper include obtaining the measurement point coordinates, a method to attach triaxial accelerometers to align with coordinate axes, methods to ensure rigidity of the mounting frame, and the effects of non-proportional damping from the elasto- meric mounts. Results from EMA provide data and validation to numerical models such as finite element models. 2001-01-0663. (SP- 1620) Air management flap with inte- grated electrical actuator. Robert Vaculik, Filterwerk MANN+HUMMEL GMBH. Modern air intake systems require active air management to solve the contrary development goals of a high-performance engine and to comply with sound emission regulations. Therefore at various locations in the air ducts, flaps and other switching devices tune the air management system according to the engine performance. The conventional vacuum actuators are more and more replaced by elec- trical systems due to assembly and packaging advantages and the lack of vacuum in critical engine situations. The development goal was to design a highly integrated system where the actuator is located inside the switching device in the first case a butterfly flap. The design consists of a fixed stator shaft with integrated coils, connectors and injection-molded fasteners and bearings. The system is designed for extreme packaging require- ments, because outside no additional device has to be assembled. The system is promising significantly lower costs than conventional systems. First applications investigated will be resonance flaps in intake manifolds, water protection flaps before the air flow meter and vari- able acoustic resonators. 2001-01-0665. (SP- 1620) Secondary air charger - High inte- grated secondary air system for intake manifolds. Karl-Ernst Hummel and Stephan Wild, FILTERWERK MANN+HUMMEL GMBH. Increasing population and a rising necessity for mobility and transportation require a growing environment protection. In the USA and in Europe legislative concluded new emission limits to reduce cold start emissions for passenger cars. An effective method to reduce HC and CO during the cold start of combustion engines is secondary air injection. Secondary air injection mixes fresh air into the exhaust gas during cold start and achieves an oxidation of HC and CO. This exothermal oxidation ele- vates the exhaust gas temperature and decreases light-off time of the catalyst. A new compact secondary air injection system for integration in the intake manifold, the so called Secondary Air Charger was devel- oped. In principle the secondary air charger works as a turbocharger, driven by the pressure drop at the throttle valve. This system was analyzed on test rigs, engine test bench and pas- senger car, successfully. Performance of the secondary air charger was comparable to the performance of commercial secondary air systems. Compactness and minimum weight of the new secondary air charger enables integration of the whole secondary air injection system in the intake manifold. 92</page><page sequence="92">2001-01-0666-2001-01-0672 2001-01-0666. (SP- 1620) Twin turbo strategy operation. Codrin-Gruie Cantemir, Technical University " Gh . Asachi" lasi. The paper is focused on possibilities to increase low- or medium- speed torque developed by a twin turbocharged engine, under full- load operation. Sequential operation mode is analyzed from the point of view of compressor and possibilities to control transition area. A modality to reduce actual technological complications for a sequential turbocharger operation (STO) is presented by the pro- posal of a new simplified configuration and a new binary Controlled Blow-off Valve (CBV). More, a new turbocharger topology schema, able to operate in series or parallel connection of the compressors (SPCO) is presented. Comparison with the sequential turbocharger operation mode (STO) reveals the SPCO 's mechanism, which can increase in a decisive way the low-, and medium-speed torque, increase turbochargers' life and simplify the transition operation mode. Solutions presented for a V6 spark ignition engine may be used without any hesitation for all twin turbo engines, including diesel. 2001-01-0667. (SP- 1599) Thermodynamic analysis of vari- able valve timing influence on SI engine efficiency. Davide Moro and Fabrizio Ponti , University of Bologna; and Gabriele Serra , Magneti Marelli. The large number of mechanical, electro-magnetic and oleo- dynamic systems for variable valve actuation developed by automo- tive suppliers demonstrates the great interest that is being devoted to their potential application on internal combustion engines. In the paper, a possible strategy to realize an original engine load control by means of both intake and exhaust variable valve timing (VVT) is briefly presented and the thermodynamic analysis of the performance obtainable with this solution is carried out. The pecu- liarity of this strategy is that it is possible to directly recirculate the desired mass of exhaust gas with less limitation with respect to the external duct architecture. To highlight its potentiality this solution has been compared with two different engine architectures: a tradi- tional Spark Ignition (SI) engine, where the load control is demanded to the throttle body; an engine equipped with a VVT sys- tem only on the intake valves, where the load control is performed by means of the well-known Early Intake Valve Closing (EI VC) strategy. The proposed engine load control technique shows a relevant efficiency increase at partial load, with respect to both throttled and EI VC engines. The obtained results are certainly overestimated, due to the theoretical thermodynamic approach used to compare the dif- ferent engine architectures, but the relevant efficiency increase shown in the paper seems to leave a good possibility to find in real experimentation a still appreciable improvement with respect to a throttled engine. 2001-01-0668. (SP- 1599) Efficient layout and calibration of variable valve trains. Karsten Roepke and Michael Fischer , IAV GmbH. Today it is relatively common for modern SI engines to have dual continuously controlled camshaft phasing. To achieve less fuel consumption and emissions the optimal valve timing has to be cho- sen for every operating point. Conventional grid measurement leads to unacceptably long duration of measurement. This paper shows that statistical experimental methods - like Design of Experiments (DoE) -can shorten test expenses and development time by more than the factor of ten without quality loss. Different layout strategies are applied and compared using the same data set. Using this method the complex relationships of full variable valve trains can be treated, which was not possible until now. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0669. (SP- 1599) Characterization of the dynamic response of a cylinder deactivation valvetrain system. Quan Zheng , Delphi Automotive Systems. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental study of a cyl- inder deactivation valvetrain system for the integration into an Engine Management System (EMS). A control-oriented lumped parameter model of the deactivation valvetrain system is developed and implemented using Matlab/Simulink, and validated by experi- mental data. Through simulation and experimental data analysis, the effect of operating conditions on the dynamic response is captured and characterized, over a wide range of operating conditions. The algorithm provides a basis for the calibration of the deactivation hardware. The generic characterization of the dynamic response can simplify the calibration parameters for the implementation in engine management systems. 2001-01-0670.

Caraceni , ELASIS S.C.p.A. A wide experimental investigation on a 16 valves, 1242 cm3 SI- engine is reported. Experimental data were collected in correspon- dence with about 250 different operating conditions of the engine. This allowed to deeply assess the accuracy of a simulation model (IDime code), developed by the authors, based on a one- dimensional computation of the gas flow in the manifolds, and on a quasi-dimensional fractal approach for combustion simulation. The model is then employed to theoretically verify the advantages that can be exploited from the adoption of various VVT (Variable Valve Timing) or VVA (Variable Valve Actuation) systems, includ- ing those realizing a throttle-less operation of the engine. The gains predicted in terms of torque profile at WOT, and of BSFC or NOx emissions at part load are quantified and discussed. The main objec- tive is the development of a methodology, which can substantially reduce experimental activity and help the definition of optimal con- trol strategies of a VVT-equipped engine. 2001-01-0671. (SP-1599) Variable valve - Control systems for spark ignition engine. Niculae Negurescu, Constantin Pana , Marcel Ginu Popa , and Alexandru Racovitza , Politehnica Univer- sity Bucharest. The present paper presents the results of both theoretical and experimental research carried out on a mono-cylinder engine equipped with an original hydraulically actuating distribution sys- tem, which determines variable valve timing (VVT). There are pres- ented the construction and the operation of the hydraulic system for which a mathematical and physical simulation pattern was created. The variable timing system enables permanent variation of both valve's timing and lifting. The results obtained by using the mathe- matical and physical simulation pattern are presented by simulating VVT engine operation and load control through the inlet valve. When the VVT engine is running, the fresh charge admission veloc- ity into the cylinder is maintained at a high level for the entire range of load variation. The admission velocity is high under small part- loads and the turbulence intensity level is also highly maintained which enables the development of the combustion process. Simulta- neously in small part-loads by load control through the inlet valve the pumping losses decrease. Thus a 10% up to 29% increase of the efficiency of the VVT engine is obtained comparatively to the case when the classic engine (the throttled one) is used. Valve timing improvement when using model mentioned above was based on the decrease of residual exhausted gases and pumping losses. The VVT system designed by the authors was tested on a mono- cylinder engine with the following characteristics: S (stroke)/D (bore) = 81/76 [mm/mm]. 2001-01-0672.

Fault tolerant distributed architectures for in- vehicle networks. Syed Misbahuddin, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; and Nizar Al-Holou, University of Detroit Mercy. The increasing trend of automotive electronics mandates the introduction of multiple processors in automotive electronics. The automotive electronic systems have to operate in harsh environ- ments having a high temperature range, high humidity, unpredict- able vibrations and rapid voltage variation. In such environment, the automotive electronic systems become vulnerable to intermittent and transient failures. Depending upon the importance of the tasks performed by the processor, a processor's failure inside automotive electronic system may lead to serious consequences. Fault tolerant computing techniques are used to keep the computer systems run- ning in spite of one or more processors' failures. The concept of fault tolerant is well known in many applications such as airplanes, industry, and military. However, the question of fault tolerant design has drawn little attention in automotive electronics. In this paper, various fault tolerant architectures for automotive applications have been proposed. In these schemes, fault tolerant is achieved by assigning the task of a failing processor to another processor in the system. In this way, the automotive electronic system may continue to function with multiple processors' failure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0674. A comprehensive hazard analysis technique for safety-critical automotive systems. Sänket Amberkar, Barbara J. Czerny , Joseph G. D'Ambrosio , Jon D. Demerly, and Brian T. Murray , Delphi Automotive Systems. Hazard analysis plays an important role in the development of safety-critical systems. Hazard analysis techniques have been used in the development of conventional automotive systems. However, as future automotive systems become more sophisticated in func- tionality, design, and applied technology, the need for a more com- prehensive hazard analysis approach has arisen. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive hazard analysis approach for system safety programs. This comprehensive approach involves applying a number of hazard analysis techniques and then integrating their results. This comprehensive approach attempts to overcome the narrower scope of individual techniques while obtain- ing the benefits of all of them. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0675.

Tolerating arbitrary node failures in the time- triggered architecture. Hermann Kopetz and Günther Bauer, Vienna University of Technology; and Stefan Poledna, TTTech Computertechnik AG. The Time-Triggered Architecture (TT A) is a distributed architec- ture for high-dependability real-time systems such as break-by- wire or steer-by- wire systems. This paper is devoted to the fault-tolerance and fault-handling capabilities of the TTA. We will present the architectural and algorithmic features of the time-triggered commu- nication protocol TTP/C that allow isolation of arbitrary failures of a node-computer in the distributed system. Having node failures iso- lated, the introduction of redundant nodes accompanied by voting services located in a generic fault-tolerance layer makes the archi- tecture tolerant to Byzantine failures of node-computers. We will also present the mechanisms that detect multiple failure scenarios at the communication system level and provide means for rapid han- dling of and deterministic recovery from such situations. Based on a sample brake-by-wire application we will provide some figures concerning the performance of the architecture and discuss how the system engineer benefits from the inherent properties of the TTA. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0678. (SP-1618) Evaluation of tailpipe emissions and cold start performance of E85 vehicles from the 2000 Ethanol Challenge. Karen Aubin, Envrionment Canada ; and Heather Smith, Natural Resources Canada. The transportation industry has been investigating ethanol as an alternative fuel for many years. Ethanol provides a clean alternative to gasoline, though widespread use of this fuel has been limited due to a number of technical challenges, such as poor cold-start perfor- mance and reduced vehicle range, and economic competitiveness with gasoline. To address the technical issues surrounding the use of ethanol, a group of university engineering teams were selected to participate in the Ethanol Vehicle Challenge by converting 1999 Chevrolet Silverado trucks to dedicated E85 operation (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline). The goals of the Ethanol Vehicle Challenge con- centrated on significantly lowering emissions and improving the cold- start performance, fuel efficiency and overall vehicle perfor- mance of the trucks. This report examines the emissions and cold- start performance results from the competition and the approaches taken by the teams to address these issues. 94</page><page sequence="94">200 1 -0 1 -067 8-200 1 -0 1 -0684 In May 2000, the Challenge vehicles underwent emissions test- ing at Environment Canada's Environmental Technology Center in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The vehicles were placed on chassis dyna- mometers and tested according to the Federal Test Procedure 75. Exhaust emissions were collected and analyzed for nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ethanol, aldehydes, and non- methane hydrocarbons. Teams incorporated novel approaches to changing the fuel delivery system to improve the vehicle's power, fuel economy, and emissions. The technologies that demonstrated an impact on emission reductions were secondary air injection, phase change material insulated catalytic converters, PCM adjust- ments, and EGR. These developments led one team to achieve the California Air Resources Board Ultra-Low Vehicle Emissions level for light-duty vehicles and another team to demonstrate improved cold starting and better driveability compared to the stock vehicle operating on gasoline. 2001-01-0679.

Edward Kane, Yiqun Huang, Darius Mehta, Courtney Frey, Michael Tillerson, Zak Chavis, Shrik Aithala, Ron Matthews, and Matt Hall, University of Texas. The University of Texas 2000 Ethanol Vehicle Challenge team remains focused on cold start, cold drivability, fuel economy, and emissions reduction for our 2000 Ethanol Vehicle Challenge entry. We used the stock PCM for all control functions except control of an innovative cold-start system our team designed. The primary modifications for improved emissions control involved ceramic coating of the exhaust manifolds, use of close-coupled ethanol- specific catalysts, use of a modified version of the California Emis- sions Calibrated PCM, and our cold- start system that eliminates the need to overfuel the engine at the beginning of the FTP. Addition- ally, we eliminated EGR at high load to improve power density. Major modifications, such as increasing the compression ratio or pressure boosting, were eliminated from consideration due to cost, complexity, reliability, or emissions penalties. Our major effort was aimed at refining our unique solution to the cold start and cold driva- bility problems associated with E85. 2001-01-0680.

The fuel called E-85 can be burned effectively in engines similar to the engines currently mass-produced for use with gasoline. Since the ethanol component of this fuel is produced from crops such as corn and sugar cane, the fuel is almost fully renewable. The different physical and chemical properties of E-85, however, do require cer- tain modifications to the common gasoline engine. The Windsor - St. Clair team has focused their attention to modifications that will improve fuel efficiency and reduce tailpipe emissions. Other modifi- cations were also performed to ensure that the vehicle would still operate with the same power and driveability as its gasoline counterpart. 2001-01-0681.

The University of Maryland team converted a model year 2000 Chevrolet Suburban to an ethanol-fueled hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) and tied for first place overall in the 2000 FutureTruck com- petition. Competition goals include a two-thirds reduction of green- house gas (GHG) emissions, a reduction of exhaust emissions to meet California ultra-low emissions vehicle (ULEV) Tier II stan- dards, and an increase in fuel economy. These goals must be met without compromising the performance, amenities, safety, or ease of manufacture of the stock Suburban. The University of Maryland FutureTruck, Proteus, addresses the competition goals with a powertrain consisting of a General Motors 3.8-L V6 engine, a 75-kW (100 hp) SatCon electric motor, and a 336-V battery pack. Additionally, Proteus incorporates several emissions-reducing and energy-saving modifications; an advanced control strategy that is implemented through use of an on-board computer and an innova- tive hybrid-electric drive train. Preliminary computer modeling, using ADVISOR, an advanced vehicle simulator, predicted that Pro- teus would achieve a reduction in exhaust emissions, a fuel effi- ciency increase of 28%, and a decrease in 0-60 mph time of 0.5-s. In the first year of the competition, Proteus achieved a 35% reduc- tion in greenhouse gas emissions, a 20% increase in fuel economy, and reduced regulated tailpipe emissions to less than the stock vehi- cle in all categories. Continuing development and optimization of Proteus' systems will lead to an even further reduction in emissions and will significantly improve fuel economy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0682.

Atkinson, West Virginia Univ. As a part of the FutureTruck 2000 advanced technology student vehicle competition sponsored by the US Department of Energy and General Motors, West Virginia University has converted a full-size sport utility vehicle into a high fuel efficiency, low emissions vehi- cle. The environmental impact of the Chevrolet Suburban SUV, in terms of both greenhouse gas emissions and exhaust emissions, was reduced through hybridization without losing any of the function- ality and utility of the base vehicle. The approach taken was one of using a high efficiency, state-of-the-art direct injection, turbochar- ged diesel engine coupled to a high output electric traction motor for power assist and to recover regenerative braking energy. The vehicle employs a state-of-the-art combination lean NOx catalyst, oxidation catalyst and particulate filter to ensure low exhaust emis- sions. Specific attention was paid to maintaining the off-road and four-wheel-drive capability of the vehicle, as well as its load carry- ing and towing features. The result is a readily manufacturable, safe and crashworthy vehicle that retains the consumer acceptability attributes of the stock vehicle. The WVU FutureTruck represents a significant step forward in the design of low environmental impact sport utilities and light trucks for the 21st century, noting that these vehicles now constitute over 50% of all new vehicles sold in the US. 2001-01-0684. CAE approach for thermal-acoustical protec- tive shields. Mark Boogemans, Colin Chen, Calin Matias, Marsha Minkov, Ryan Moffatt, and Frank Popielas, Dana Corp. Today, Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) is a feature that becomes more and more essential in the development of Thermal- Acoustical Protective Shields (TAPS). The development cycle of TAPS needs to be reduced while simultaneously reducing costs. The performance, functionality and visual appearance need to be improved as well. This paper will describe our general CAE approach, which is based on the use of different CAD systems and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). We will describe how we use the results of our approach in the development of new TAPS. Because this approach is based on the knowledge of the parame- ters that exist and how they influence a TAPS function, we will first discuss the most important of these parameters. Here we split our discussion into 'What is a TAPS,' 'What are the main steps of mak- ing a TAPS - Designing, prototype,' and 'How a TAPS works in an engine.' We will then explain the different FEA utilization's. Here we will describe how we obtain the information about thermal shielding, acoustical behavior, obtaining the blanket shape, the forming process, and how we can optimize process and function.

Nakaoka, M. Kameike, S. Ono, T. Abiko, and T. Takeda, NOK Corp. A seal ring of PEEK material was developed and shown to with- stand high pressure and high shaft velocity. This was made possible by cooling the ring material using leakage through an engineered passage at the cut junction. The cooling effect of leakage rate was modeled thermodynamically, and calculated leakage rates were compared to measured results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0686. The selection of elastomer compounds through correlation of rubber properties to seal life. Boris Dinzburg, Chi- cago Rawhide SKF. Predictive life determination of elastomer compounds is becom- ing increasingly important due to shortened development time and reductions in cost. Currently to select rubber compounds the auto- motive industry uses different specifications. In the USA and in most European countries these specifications are based on ASTM D 2000, and in Japan the specifications are based on JIS-B 2402. These test methods are mostly related to single point measurement. Unfortunately, from decades of long experience, engineers know that the real life time of elastomeric parts cannot be derived from these currently used specifications and test methods. During investi- gation of the sealing mechanism performed by Chicago Rawhide for many years, the basic rubber properties responsible for seal life have been established. Using both standard ASTM and new methods for measuring the change in rubber properties during oil immersion aging, correlation was established between the kinetics of such changes and seal life. The paper describes the rubber properties, test methods and test pro- cedures which can help engineers to develop and select rubber com- pounds without using the dynamic seal bench test. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0687. Sealing rougher surface finishes using con- formable rubber coating on MLS. Jeff A. Foster, Dana Corp. Some engineers in the U.S. are still hesitant to change from graphite cylinder head gaskets to MLS designs due to surface finish capabilities at engine plants and in the aftermarket. Sealing these various hardware surface finishes is accomplished via a rubber on the surface. The coating's ability to conform to various surface irregularities while withstanding high temperatures, long-term cool- ant and oil exposure, and joint shearing forces is paramount to long- term sealing. This paper will explore the sealing capabilities of a highly conformable flouro-polymer rubber coating developed spe- cifically to seal rougher surface finishes. 2001-01-0688.

Transmission manufactures have been required of performance improvement and miniaturization for the AT (automatic transmis- sion) or CVT (continuously variable transmission) unit from car manufactures. Current unit is composed of Aluminum piston, O-ring (or D-ring) and drift ball. We changed design from O-ring to lip type seal and aluminum piston to high strength steel plate pis- ton in order to miniaturize. On the other hand, we changed drift ball to canceler in order to make faster response. At this time, we selected new lip design and developed high tensile strength ACM to keep as same oil pressure resistance and durability as current O-ring. In addition, we could have lower friction with new design of lip shape. 2001-01-0689. Investigation into the effect of gel hardness on solder joints.

This paper reports an investigation into the effect of low viscos- ity silicone gel potting on Ball Grid Array (BGA) solder joints and surface mount resistor solder joints showing it to be relative to the hardness of the encapsulant. Failures in BGAs and resistor solder joints negatively affect the reliability of electronic modules in any high temperature environment, especially the automotive underhood environment. The empirical testing shows the effect of the gel hardness on sol- der joints by continuously monitoring the circuit continuity using an Anatech® Tester during various thermal environmental tests that simulate underhood conditions. The pass/fail criteria used will be two-fold. The first will be actual event failures registered on the Anatech cataloging solder joint failure and the Salt Water Immer- sion Test proving water intrusion. The second, a more subjective discourse, will concern the visual failures such as bubbles or areas lacking adhesion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0690. Thermal simulation of the electrical distribu- tion box. T. Ikeya, N. Ito, A. Chiriku, M. Okada, Y. Miyazawa, and N. Mochizuki, YAZAKI Corp. Our paper describes our R&amp;D results regarding thermal simula- tion of the electrical distribution box (EDB). We have developed simulation techniques by using the finite element method (FEM). In order to achieve a high level of accuracy in the thermal simulation, we built an appropriate model of the EDB. Because bus-bars and connectors with wires play important roles in the EDB, the bus-bars used in the model were exact replicas of those used in the EDB. As a result, a high accuracy, (± 5 degrees Celsius,) was achieved in the simulation. We simulated another EDB model using the same simu- lation conditions, which we have defined. The accuracy of the simu- lation achieved was ± 5 degrees Celsius as well. Our study suggests that our thermal simulation technology is certainly a powerful tool for the design of EDB. Optimal thermal conditions achieved by changing both the size and materials of the bus-bars and connectors based on the simulation results will provide high quality, including improved reliability, for various EDB products. 2001-01-0691. Embedded electronics in electro-mechanical systems for automotive applications. Bruce A. Myers, Jeff H. Burns, and Joseph M. Ratell, Delphi Delco Electronics Systems. The extensive use of electronics has revolutionized the imple- mentation and scope of many of the features and functions in a mod- ern automobile. This automotive electronic revolution has signifi- cantly improved the performance, reliability and comfort of the automobile. In some cases, electronics have also simplified compo- nent fabrication and automotive assembly. However, the full poten- tial that electronics have for reducing the assembly complexity of the automobile has yet to be realized. More extensive use of elec- tronics embedded into mechanical components and mechatronic systems will significantly simplify automotive assembly in the future. This paper examines three current and future applications of embedded electronics in automotive applications. These examples illustrate the advantages and challenges associated with embedded electronic concepts. Future applications, new technology develop- ment needs, and changes in automotive component sourcing, are discussed. Given the significant advantages of embedding electronic functions into automotive system enclosures, it is clear that this trend will gain momentum in the future. The end result will provide significantly higher value and higher reliability transportation for the consumer. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0692. Board level reliability of ceramic CSP in harsh temperature cycling test condition.

For the CSP mounting on organic PWB, Thermal Coefficient of Expansion (TCE) and Young's modu- lus of components, solder joint and temperature cycling condition affect to the reliability. In this study, Ceramic CSP was subjected to -40/+ 150 degree C temperature cycling test condition that is typi- cal automotive requirement for harsh thermal circumstances. Varie- ties of test matrix were prepared. Flip chip and wire bonding options for die-carrier interconnection, different board materials and differ- ent solder joint structure on CSP were also evaluated as a part of the matrix.

E-modularization of rear closures: Integration of new generation of electrical systems. P. Reilhac and J. P. Eus- tache , Vale o Wiper Systems ; J. Leleve, Valeo Lighting Systems; and P. Bayeux, Valeo Security Systems. This paper presents the potential for rear closure sub-modules. Side door modules and lightweight rear closures have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However the characteristics of future liftgates allow the design of specific mechatronic sub-modules (e-modules™). Beside structure, rear closures satisfy three main functions: rear vision, rear signaling and rear access. All are undergoing a genera- tion change that will be outlined in the first part of this paper, system by system. Each time the rationale behind modular integration, whether electronic or mechanical, will be reviewed. The second part presents examples of e-modules™ that illustrate the potential gains in terms of ease of assembly, packaging optim- ization and network integration. 2001-01-0694. (SP- 1579) Development of the chemical recy- cling technology of glass fiber-reinforced PA6 parts. Kaoru Inoue and Yuichi Miyake, Toyota Motor Corp. Recently, the plastic material is positively introduced for auto- motive parts due to the needs of vehicle weight reduction and cost saving. On the other hand, the countermeasure for scrapped car is a big subject to need to consider as a car maker. Therefore, the development of recycling technology for plastic parts has been nec- essary. In this study, we tried to develop recycling technology for glass fiber reinforced Polyamideö (PA6) which is applied to various automotive parts like an air intake manifold. As a recycling tech- nique, we focused on the chemical recycling which can reclaim raw material of PA6(e-caprolactams) from the post-consumer automo- tive parts. The chemical recycling we selected can be put on a higher priority because it has possibility to utilize the limited resource repeatedly. As a result, we could retain high purity of e-caprolactams using our following two techniques which make possible to recycle Polyamide 6 materials. One is to separate PA6 from glass fiber. To optimize pressure is important after decreasing the resin viscosity with optimized organic acid. Another is to depolymerize PA6 continuously using phosphoric acid which sepa- rated the glass fiber. Recycled PA6 which we synthesized from using e-caprolactams from the above method showed same level of physical property as original PA6. 2001-01-0696. The concept of end-of-life car recycling system in Russia. Roman L. Petrov , AVTOVAZ Inc. Dismantling and utilization of end-of-life vehicles (ELV) greatly influences the total ecological parameters of the vehicle in terms of its complex impact on human beings and nature. So far in Russia there are no specialized centers with ELV utili- zation capabilities. Further there are no laws regulating ELV issues. At the same time, in some developed Russian regions, having a high population density, the ELV utilization problem becomes more and more critical. AVTOVAZ is the biggest producer of passenger cars (trade mark: LADA) in Russia. AVTOVAZ has developed a concept for a ELV recycling system for the Samara region (the plant's location). The system starts with ensuring that legislation is in place to define responsibilities for addressing the major participants of the ELV cycle: Car manufacturer, the last car owner, EVL stacking center, dismantling and recycling center, residue disposal shredder center and Regional Environment Committee on vehicle-environment inspection. AVTOVAZ together with the Samara region's Environment Committee and other companies form an infrastructure, that is expected to provide arrangement, technical and financial support during implementation of the ELV recycling system in Samara region. AVTOVAZ R&amp;D specialists also are working on comparative analysis of all LADA cars dismantling, materials in-use (holders and fasteners), developing appropriate catalogues on recycling and instructions on dismantling of all cars in production. Another field of activity is improving the ecological safety of new LADA cars. These specialists define the direction of environment safety improv- ing and recyclability of new LADA cars. 2001-01-0697. (SP- 1579) Size reduction and material separa- tion technologies for the recovery of automotive interior trim ABS and PP plastics from dismantled end-of-life vehicles: Pre- liminary research into continuous processing. Michael M. Fisher , American Plastics Council ; Michael B. Biddle , MBA Polymers , Inc.; and Chris Ryan, Metech International. The life-cycle benefits of plastics in automotive applications are significant and continue to expand. Achieving cost-effective recy- cling of interior plastic components obtained from end-of-life vehi- cles (ELVs) remains a formidable technical and economic challenge worldwide. The American Plastics Council (APC) has pioneered large-scale process development work toward advancing environ- mentally and economically sound recovery technologies for plastics from ELVs. Groundbreaking studies have focused on the recovery of ABS and PP interior trim plastics. A combination of dry and wet processing of over 50,000 pounds of interior trim parts obtained through selective dismantling has been completed and streams of ABS and PP isolated. This work included the evaluation of fast mid- infrared plastics ID technology to facilitate the separation and purifi- cation process. Both sorted and unsorted trim was processed. The overall program objective was to obtain both of these recovered plastics in acceptable form for possible reuse in automotive or other applications. Detailed information on process equipment and plant design along with process strategies and detailed material balance data is presented. This work quantified the limitations of density separation to achieve clean streams of unfilled PP, filled PP, and unfilled ABS interior trim plastics from end-of-life vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0698. (SP- 1579) Masticated Rubber: A recycling success story. Andrew Haber, NRI Industries Inc. The term Masticated Rubber has become synonymous with a mixture of recycled rubber and fiber derived from passenger car tires. Masticated Rubber has been used for over 15 years by a variety of OEMs for air &amp; water management applications in the transporta- tion industry. Its success is a result of being able to offer value- added solutions to recycling car tires and low price/high perfor- mance characteristics. The objective of this paper are to provide an update on the advances made in the manufacture of Masticated Rubber com- pounds, to present data for typical applications and to present data showing the environmental benefits associated with using this mate- rial. Not only are fewer passenger car tires being burned for fuel or 97</page><page sequence="97">2001-01-0698-2001-01-0705 sent to landfills, but factory greenhouse gas emissions are also reduced (when compared to other rubber manufacturing processes). 2001-01-0699. (SP- 1579) Improvements in lubricating oil quality by an on-line oil recycler for a refuse truck using in ser- vice testing. Gordon E. Andrews and Hu Li, University of Leeds; M. H. Jones, Swansea Tribolo gy Services Ltd.; and J. Hall, A. A. Rahman, and P. Mawson, Top High UK Ltd. A method of cleaning lubricating oil on line was investigated using a fine bypass particulate filter followed by an infra red heater. Two bypass filter sizes of 6 and 1 micron were investigated, both filter sizes were effective but the one micron filter had the greatest benefit. This was tested on two nominally identical EURO 1 emis- sions compliance refuse trucks, fitted with Perkins Phazer 210TÌ 6 liter turbocharged intercooled engines and coded as RT320 and RT321. These vehicles had lubricating oil deterioration and emis- sions characteristics that were significantly different, in spite of their similar age and total mileage. RT321 showed an apparent heavier black smoke than RT320. Comparison was made with the oil quality and fuel and lubricating oil consumption on the same vehicles and engines with and without the on-line bypass oil recycler. Engine oils were sampled and analyzed about every 400 miles. Both vehicles started the test with an oil drain and fresh lubricating oil. The two refuse trucks were tested in a different sequence, the RT320 without the recycler fitted and then fitted later and the RT321 with the recy- cler fitted and then removed later in the test and both without any oil change. The RT320 was also the one with the finer bypass filter. The test mileage was nearly 8,000 miles both trucks. The amount of fresh oil top up was monitored and the results corrected for this dilution effect. The results showed that the on-line bypass oil recy- cler cleaning system reduced the rate of fall of the TBN by 23% and 49% for two trucks respectively. A 73% reduction in the rate of increase of the TAN incurred for one of the trucks. The soot in oil was reduced by -70% on average for both trucks. The reduction in the rate of carbon accumulation in oil was 55% for the refuse truck with heavy smoke emissions. There was a 56% reduction in iron. The rate of oxidation, nitration and sulfation of oils was significantly reduced. There was an improvement of the fuel economy of about 3%. The lubricating oil consumption was reduced by 40% for 1 micron recycler filter and 30% for 6 micron filter. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0700.

This paper presents some of Renault's know-how in modeling aerodynamic flows obtained in an operational environment on development configurations. The methodologies, developed from Navier Stokes equations averaged for turbulence, are used indeed to size openings and body elements, determine positions and opti- mize the geometry of the various air inlets and outlets, reduce pres- sure losses in the cab ventilation circuits, improve exchanger effi- ciency, optimize the underhood architecture devise encapsulation solutions, model windscreen de-icing, reduce aerodynamic noise and improve the understanding of certain physical processes associ- ated with fouling. 2001-01-0701. (SP- 1600) On the calculation of external aero- dynamics: Industrial benchmarks. B. Basara, AVL List GmbH; V. Przulj, AVL UK Ltd.; and P. Tibaut, AVL AST. The paper presents the-state-of-the-art numerical simulation of the flow around vehicles by examining a number of various indus- trial benchmarks. A selection of results, obtained by a finite volume numerical code based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach, illustrates the capability of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to provide accurate and reliable solutions in the area of external car aerodynamics. Benchmarks presented here are Peugeot 405 model, SAE Notchback Reference Body and VW-CFD model. Due attention was given to the reduction of both numerical as well as turbulence modeling error. This also includes the use of second-order accurate differencing schemes for convection terms and the full Reynolds-stress model to model Reynolds stresses. The computations showed a substantial difference in the flow patterns predicted by the standard k-e model and by the full Reynolds-stress model. The Reynolds stress model predictions of the pressure distri- bution on the car body agree extremely well with the measurements. Some other details of the flow around car models are also well captured. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0702.

Time-averaged velocity profiles are computed and compared with the experiments and show good agree- ment. The separation length and the base pressure coefficient are presented. The predicted pumping process in the near wake occurs with a Strouhal number St = 0.073, compared with St = 0.069 in the experiment.

(SP-1600) Numerical flow simulations of a detailed car underbody. Simone Sebben, Volvo Car Corp. The airflow around a detailed car underbody has been simulated using a commercial CID software. Moving ground and rotating- wheel boundary conditions were applied in order to allow compari- sons of Cd and dCd values with experimental data from a wind tun- nel fitted with moving ground facilities. The calculated Cd and dCd figures compared very well with the available experimental results. Four configurations were tested and the maximum difference between experimental and numerical Cd values was 0.009. The indi- vidual contribution of different parts of the vehicle to the total drag was calculated and is discussed in this paper. This paper also describes in detail the numerical technique used to perform the computations. 2001-01-0704.

The aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle underbody are one of the critical components to achieve efficient fuel-economical vehicles. On the other hand, computer memory and time make it dif- ficult to make the complex geometry of the underbody of an actual vehicle including the engine room. In this paper, we have investi- gated a new CFD analysis method using the automatic tetrahedral/ prismatic cell generation tools for the analysis of an underbody flow. The CFD analysis results are compared with experimental data. This new method also contributes to reducing the development term of the aerodynamics characteristics with underbody. 2001-01-0705.

Validation studies often contains uncertainties due to boundary condition differences between computational fluid dynamics, CFD-, and experimental fluid dynamics, EFD-, in the setup for the cases involved. The present study is in two parts where the first part is a 2D para- metric study of two geometrical parameters and their variation with blockage. The parameters were radius in the transition region from the windscreen to the roof and the angle of attack for the wind- screen. A mesh blending technology has been used where an inter- polation between two meshes is conducted on a vertices level for 98</page><page sequence="98">2001-01-0705-2001-01-0712 the creation of a mix between the two grids. Many CFD simulations have been done of which some are presented. The windscreen angle was more sensitive to blockage in the sense that trends in drag from two configurations may be errone- ously predicted if large blockage is encountered. The front radius seems to be not so much sensitive in that respect and trends in drag and especially absolute drag levels changes only at very large block- age ratios. A separate study of blockage correction factors in the Volvo wind tunnel, hereafter-denoted PVT after its Swedish name, is ongo- ing, and for this study CFD simulations will be used for investiga- tion of blockage effects for a full-scale car in this wind tunnel. The initial stage of this work which is more or less being able to simulate a slotted wall wind tunnel are presented. Comparisons are done with a car in a free stream, e.g., a very large solid- wall wind tunnel. 2001-01-0707. The development of tools for the automatic extraction of desired information from large amounts of engi- neering data. Jianrong Dong, Gabriella Cerrato-Jay, and Chih- Hung Chung, MTS Systems Corp. Product development processes generate large quantities of experimental and analytical data. The data evaluation process is usu- ally quite lengthy since the data needs to be extracted from a large number of individual output files and arranged in suitable formats before they can be compared. When the data quantity grows extremely large, manual extraction cannot be done in a limited time- frame. This paper describes a set of tools developed by MTS engi- neers to automatically extract the desired information from a large number of files and perform data post-processing. The tools greatly improved both speed and accuracy of the evaluation process during the development of a sound quality-based end-of-line inspection system for seat tracks. It allowed engineers to quickly gather a com- prehensive understanding of the relative importance of individual design parameters and of their correlation to the subjective percep- tion of the sound quality of the seat track. 2001-01-0708. (SP- 1578) System functional safety through automated electrical design analysis. David D. Ward, MIRA; and Chris Price, University of Wales, Aberystwyth. This paper describes the use of electrical design analysis soft- ware to automate electrical design analysis techniques such as fail- ure mode and effects analysis and sneak circuit analysis. It illustrates the type of reports that an automated electrical analysis can produce and compares them with those produced by an engineer unaided. The main advantage of the electrical design analysis software is that it significantly reduces the amount of effort needed to complete a competent design analysis report. This makes it possible to per- form design analysis much earlier in the design process, at a stage where it is still relatively cost-effective to resolve problems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0709. (SP-1578) TREASURI: An innovative simula- tion method for the vibro-acoustic design of passenger compart- ments. Juergen Ochs and Klaus Bohnert, Dr. Ing. h.c. F.Porsche AG; and Hermann Paetzold, Rieter Automotive Switzerland. The accuracy of nowadays CAE tools for simulation of sound pressure level distributions in the passenger compartment of vehi- cles is not satisfactory because of the simplify models, especially with regard to the description of common passive acoustical treat- ments. This report describes the application of the TREASURI method on a complete vehicle, equipped with; sound deadening treatment; sound absorbing material; sound insulation treatment; and interior trim material (e.g., instrument panel, seats, center console). In order to validate the method, the simulation results were com- pared with the measurement results from the corresponding vehicle. The evaluation shows that the TREASURI approach yields consid- erable improvements in simulation accuracy up to 300 Hz compared to classical approaches. This method now enables reliable predic- tions of acoustical influence on structural modifications and changes of the sound package. 2001-01-0710.

To help our customers to design their parts, USINOR Research Center, with the collaboration of DOVAL, develop HYDROPUNCH, a finite element software to estimate quickly the difficulties of hydroformed parts without taking into account the process parameters. HYDROPUNCH is based on a simplified computing method, which provides the evaluation of the geometrical difficulties of the prebent and hydroformed tubes as soon as the product design stage and which may help the tool design office for the definition of the hydroforming process. The interest of this method, the speed of execution and several functionalities will be illustrated by different examples. 2001-01-0712. (SP-1578) Open interfaces for bridging the steps in the chain of a totally simulation-based software develop- ment. Kave Kianer, Uwe Finis, Thomas Pusch, and Siegbert Slopi- anka, AFT Atlas Fahrzeugtechnik GmbH. This paper proposes a new approach towards achieving a totally simulation-based software development process for electronic con- trol units (ECU) in automotive applications. It introduces a tool- based methodology to support the system software designer right from inception through the chain by bridging the main steps of soft- ware development, i.e., "Simulation/ Automatic Code Generation," "Compilation" and "Measurement &amp; Calibration." The coherent linkage of these steps to each other by means of flexible open inter- faces (conform with ASAM-MCD and OSEK) is addressed in this paper. One can consider the stages of a simulation-based software development as being similar to the representation of a three- stage waterfall model, in which the following nodes comprise the devel- opment stages: System Simulation (e.g. by using Matlab/Simulink) and function Auto-code Generation (e.g., by using TargetLink) Compilation, Linkage and Download Measurement &amp; Calibration (e.g., by using MARC I of AFT) The usual problem of a totally simulation-based software devel- opment for ECU is how to establish interfaces between the develop- ment stages, so that a consistent linkage and smooth development flow is assured regardless of the tools used at these stages. This is a non-trivial problem if the employed tools at the development stages are expected to exchange data and come from different ven- dors. This paper introduces two powerful software tools to bridge the aforementioned stages. In fact, these software tools are a means to "dock" the three aforementioned phases. The first and the second development stage are interfaced by means of AFT Controller Inter- face (ACI), whereas the second and the third stage ("Compilation" and "Measurement &amp; Calibration") are interfaced to each other by an A2L-Generator. ACI is a library of digital, analogue and CAN- specific Blocksets to produce a comfortable interface for the OSEK- conform ECU-OS and cascading TargetLink sub-systems for per- forming various tasks. A2L-Generator, which is composed of a Par- ser, a Merger, and a Configuration Description Language (CDL), is a tool for automatic generation of calibration interface software, which is ASAM-MCD-conform. The automatically generated A2L- file can subsequently be used for measurement and calibration pur- poses. We demonstrate how open interfaces such as ACI and A2L- Generator ease the process of simulation-based software develop- ment and resolve the shortcoming of incompatibility in data exchange if different simulation tools are "chained" together. 99</page><page sequence="99">200 1-01 -07 1 A - 200 1-01 -07 24 2001-01-0714. Information support of scalable supply chain configuration: Generic methodology and reusable knowledge management. Charu Chandra , University of Michigan; and Alex- ander V., St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian. The purpose of a supply chain (SC) is to transform incomplete information about market and available resources into coordinated plans for production and replenishment of goods in the network formed by cooperating units. One of the major characteristics of this organization type is scalability. Data and knowledge in the SC can be shared via Internet, Intranet, and Extranet for business-to- consumer, business-to-business service, and business-to-business goods transactions.

(SP-1616) A methodology for measurement and analysis of head-to-B-pillar contact pressure and area response. Himamshu B. Marigowda, Jesse V. Benny, and Patrick J. Atkinson, Kettering Univ.; and Kurt Schulz , Randal Gosk, Ed Clancy, and Ricky Broughton, BREED Technologies. Government accident statistics show that approximately 35% of all car accident victims suffer an injury to the head and face. Such injuries are common during frontal, side, and rollover accidents as the head may impact the steering wheel, side pillars, windshield, or roof. Further, non-threatening injuries (i.e., abrasions) may be suf- fered due to contact with the deployed airbag, or, in the case of an out-of-position occupant, a deploying airbag. While the forces and accelerations measured internal to the head are known to correlate with serious head injury (i.e., concussion, skull fracture, diffuse axo- nal injury), it is currently not possible to record how the loads are distributed over the head and face with the current ATD. Ultimately, such data could eventually be used to provide improved resolution as to the probability of superficial, soft tissue damage since past cadaver studies show that the distribution of contact pressures are related to such injuries. In the current study, we present a methodol- ogy to record the contact pressures and area between a Hybrid III, ATD head-neck complex and the B -pillar. This contact event repre- sented one exemplar impact event, which typically results in soft tis- sue damage in the field. The ATD head /neck subassembly was mounted transversely on a carriage and propelled along a track to a given pre-impact velocity and was stopped by a rigid mounted B-pillar structure. The head/neck was propelled to three different velocities prior to impact: 7.9, 12.1 and 14.3 kph. The contact pres- sure and area at the interface of the head were recorded digitally using an electronic pressure transducer both with and without a side air curtain. At each impact velocity, the air curtain was statically inflated to pressures of 13.8, 20.7, 27.6, 41.4 &amp; 55.1 kPa to deter- mine the effect of bag pressure on head-pillar contact mechanics. The pressure mat transducer recorded the contact pressure and area at 1,340 Hz. It was found that direct contact of the head against the B-pillar produced large contact pressures centered at the point of contact which migrated as the head rotated laterally during the con- tact event. The introduction of the side air curtain produced a signifi- cant reduction in contact pressures and head g forces. These data show one method of determining how the head surface is loaded over time, and how that load is distributed over the head. 2001-01-0720.

(SP-1616) Sled system requirements for the analysis of side impact thoracic injury criteria and occupant protection. Richard Kent, Jeff Crandall , and Jon Butcher, Univer- sity of Virginia Automobile Safety Laboratory; and Russell Morris, Autoliv, Inc. This paper discusses struck-side occupant thoracic response to side-impact loading and the requirements of a sled system capable of reproducing the relevant motions of a laterally impacted vehicle. A simplified viscoelastic representation of a thorax is used to evalu- ate the effect of the door velocity-time profile on injury criteria and on the internal stress state of the thorax. Simulations using a pre- scribed door velocity-time profile (punch impact) are contrasted against simulations using a constant-velocity impact (Heidelberg- type impact). It is found that the stress distribution and magnitude within the thorax, in addition to the maximum thorax compression and viscous response, depend not only on the door-occupant closing velocity, but also on the shape of the door velocity-time profile throughout the time of contact with the occupant. A sled system capable of properly reproducing side-impact door and seat motion is described. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0723. (SP-1616) Occupant injury patterns in side crashes. Abdullatif K. Zaouk, Ana Maria Eigen, and Kennedy H. Digges, George Washington Univ. This paper presents an analysis of the National Automotive Sam- pling System (NASS) and the Fatal Accident Reporting Systems (FARS) data for the combined years 1988-97 with respect to side impacts. Accident variables, vehicle variables, occupant variables and their interactions have been considered, with special emphasis on occupant injury patterns. The crash modes considered are car-to- car, car-to-LTV (light trucks and vans) and car to narrow object, with special emphasis on the latter two. This study was undertaken to obtain a better understanding of injury patterns in lateral impacts, their associated causation factors, and to obtain information that will assist in prioritizing crash injury research problems in near side impacts. Of particular interest is the increase in the population of light trucks and vans and their influ- ence on side impact priorities. Conclusions will be drawn regarding the frequency and injury severity of car-to-LTV s and car to narrow objects. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0724.

This paper describes the influence of the arc discharge 100</page><page sequence="100">2001-01-0724-2001-01-0732 on connector terminals, and the very promising solution, which is anew type of connector for 42V automotive electrical system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0725. (SP- 16 19) 42V PWM conversion and control technologies and E/EDS architecture. Kang Li, Jeff Berryhill, Jylain Echols, and Ronald Tejero, Yazaki North America, Inc. The automotive industry is transitioning from the present 14V electrical system to a 42V system. This voltage evolution is due to the number of new systems (safety, fuel economy and customer con- venience) being developed which require increased electrical power that a 14V system cannot deliver. During this transition, it will be necessary to control 14V subsystems in a 42V architecture. This paper presents 42V PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) voltage con- version and control technologies as a solution to control these 14V subsystems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0726. (SP-1619) Driving small motors at 42V Power- Net. Frank Klotz and Alfons Graf, Infineon Technologies AG. The following article discusses various proposed solutions, for driving small motors from the existent 12V or 24V supply voltage system at the 42V PowerNet by using dc-dc converters or pulse width modulation (PWM) for voltage- and power-matching with respect to the EMI behvior. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0727. The future possibilities of fuse systems for increased power management capabilities in future 42V archi- tecture. Henning H. Schulte, Jürgen Scheele, Claudia Schniotalla, Bärbel Witt, and Uwe Hill, Wilhelm PUDENZ GmbH; and Thomas J. Stack, COOPER Bussmann. Future automotive fusing concepts will have, with regards to the upcoming change in the voltage (42V instead of 12V) and to fulfill power-management capabilities, more features than today's fusing concepts. The new systems will include high-power current- distribution with back-up-melting-elements and switching-off- features which can be activated when ever the "car-control-system" gives the order to do. Additionally the total concept can be used as a sensor for power-management, as individual current- sensors are part of this system. 2001-01-0728. (SP-1619) Belt-driven starter-generator for future 42-volt systems. Rassem R. Henry, Bruno Lequesne, and Shaotang Chen, Delphi Research Labs; and Jeffrey J. Ronning, and Yanhong Xue, Delphi E&amp;C Energenix Center. This paper explores issues related with the design and implemen- tation of belt-driven starter-generators for future 42- V systems. Belt-driven starter-generators can offer many advantages including smooth restarts, high efficiency, and convenient packaging. Future vehicle systems require these characteristics to enable fuel economy functions like "engine off at idle" and "x-by-wire." Belt-driven starter-generators are often easier to package in contrast with fly- wheel-mounted systems, which require powertrain modifications and in many cases a longer package. A prototype system based on a belt-driven induction machine mounted on a small, European engine is described in the paper. Test results for both cranking and generation are shown and analyzed. Efficient, high-power genera- tion was confirmed and high-speed (beyond 400 engine rpm) crank- ing was demonstrated down to the targeted -20° C. The paper also provides comparisons with various engine-starting, machine ther- mal, and electrical model results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0729. Development of vapor reducing fuel tank sys- tem. Tomoyasu Arase, Takashi Ishikawa, Masahide Kobayashi, Yoshihiko Hyodo, Masahiro Kasai, and Nobuhiro Nakano, Toyota Motor Corp. In succession to the world-first introduction of a mass production gasoline hybrid passenger car into the Japanese market in 1997, Toyota also has introduced an enhanced version of the above to the US and European markets in 2000. Upon introduction of Toyota Hybrid System (THS) into the US market, a drastic reduction of gasoline vapor evaporation from the fuel tank was necessary, in order to meet the most stringent exhaust emission (SULEV) and evaporative emission standards in the world. In order to meet this requirement, a fuel tank system named "Vapor Reducing Fuel Tank System" was developed. This is the first commercial application in the world to use a variable tank vol- ume to drastically reduce gasoline vapor generation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0730. Estimating real time diurnal permeation from constant temperature measurements. Marek Lockhart, Mark Nul- man, and Giuseppe Rossi, Ford Motor Co. Using the results of Constant Temperature (CT) Permeation Measurements to estimate Real Time Diurnal (RTD) permeation emissions has a number of practical advantages. In particular, Cons- tant Temperature measurements are easier to set up and control in a laboratory environment, and Constant Temperature measurements provide for data checks using simple self-consistency tests that are not possible with Real Time Diurnal measurements. Furthermore, there is no need to repeat permeation measurements for each sepa- rate real-time temperature profile of interest. The same two Constant Temperature measurements can be used to estimate permeation per- formance for many different temperature cycles - for example, the temperature cycles prescribed by CARB, EPA, and EEC, or the dif- ferent temperature profiles experienced by separate fuel system components during a vehicle SHED test. This paper reviews the sci- entific basis for the procedure, discusses both its strengths and its limitations, and explains the applicability of Constant Temperature measurements to situations involving multi-component fuels and to fuel subsystems made of several different polymer materials. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0731. Evaluation of the ignition hazard posed by onboard refueling vapor recovery canisters. Dale Andreatta, Gary J. Hey dinger, and Ron Bixel, S.E.A., Inc.; Joonhong Park, Ohio State Univ.; and Scott W. Jorgensen, General Motors Corp. ORVR (Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery) canisters trap vapors during normal operations of a vehicle's engine, and during refueling. This study evaluates the relative risks involved should a canister rupture in a crash. A canister impactor was developed to simulate real- world impacts and to evaluate the canisters' rupture characteristics. Numerous performance aspects of canisters were evaluated: the energy required to rupture a canister; the spread of carbon particles following rupture; the ease of ignition of vapor- laden particles; the vapor concentration in the area of ruptured, vapor-laden canisters; and the potential of crashes to rupture and ignite canisters. Results from these five items were combined into a risk analysis. 2001-01-0732. A numerical study of automotive gas tank filler pipe two phase flow. R. Banerjee and K. M. Isaac, University of Missouri; and L. Oliver and W. Breig, Day co Technical Center. Automotive refueling is gaining greater importance because fuel vapors released during refueling are believed to increase ozone levels in urban areas. As a step towards On-Board Refueling Vapor Recovery (ORVR) designs, vapor generation and transport during refueling needs to be understood to develop recovery techniques. The objective of the present study is to understand the fluid flow inside the automotive gas tank filler pipe using commercially avail- able Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. This effort is 101</page><page sequence="101">2001-01-0732-2001-01-0736 expected to yield detailed flow field information, including air entrainment. The phenomena of well-back, the process of fuel flood- ing the filler pipe and flowing backwards at the filler pipe mouth, and the pressure transients inside the tank leading to premature noz- zle shut-off were examined. The current work includes unsteady CFD simulation with gaso- line and air as the working fluids. The fuel tank was modeled with a vent pipe, and due to its small diameter, pressure build-up inside the tank was observed. To simulate multiphase flow, Volume of Fluid (VOF) model was used. Three flow rates were considered: 15, 30,45 and 60 liters/min (1pm). Turbulence modeling was done using RNG k-e model. The results show that air entrainment depends on gasoline flow rate. Design of the vent pipe and the tank pressure were found to be important variables that affected air entrained dur- ing the refueling process. The simulation successfully showed well- back when the tank was completely filled with gasoline. The simulation results show good agreement with previous experimental work, demonstrating that C¥D can be used as a design tool to shorten the design, development and cost reduction cycle of nozzle, filler pipe and tank system. 2001-01-0733. Impact and control of canister bleed emis- sions. Roger S. Williams and C. Reid Clontz, Westvaco Corp . Current EPA and CARB regulations allow a maximum of 2.0 g/test for Hot Soak + Diurnal evaporative emissions. The State of California has adopted LEV II regulations that will decrease the evaporative emissions standard to 0.5 g/test starting in the 2004 model year. These regulations also include a Zero Emission Vehicle or ZEV program. The ZEV program allows car manufacturers to substitute vehicles that meet the SULEV tail pipe emission stan- dards and have zero fuel evaporative emissions for electric vehicles. The increased stringency of these regulations has necessitated sig- nificant decreases in hydrocarbon emissions from evaporative emis- sion canisters. For example, canister vent emissions may be at levels of 100-300 mg/test for a vehicle that meets the current regulations. However, canister emission targets should be 50 mg/test and less for LEV II and 10 mg/test and less for zero evaporative emission vehi- cles. Emissions at this level are not due to a lack of adsorptive capacity in the canister, but rather are due to diffusion of hydrocar- bon species. These emissions are often referred to as bleed emis- sions. A technique was developed to study the level of bleed emissions specifically from canister vent ports. Canister design and purge vol- ume were shown to have a significant impact on bleed emissions. Further, the incorporation of a small auxiliary chamber in series with the primary canister was shown to decrease bleed emissions significantly. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0734. (SP-1584) A study of stratified charge combus- tion characteristics in new concept direct injection SI gasoline engine. Tatsushi Nakashima, Kimitaka Saito , and Masatoshi Basaki , Nippon Soken , Inc.; and Shigeo Furuno, Toyota Motor Corp. A new stratified charge system has been developed for direct injection gasoline engines. The special feature of this system is employment of a thin fan-shaped fuel spray formed by a slit nozzle and a shell-shaped piston cavity. This system, basically classified into the wall-guided mixture preparation concept that leads air/fuel mixture to the spark plug periphery by means of spray penetration and piston cavity configuration without an extra intake air flow con- trolling system, obtained wide engine operating area with stratified combustion and high output performance. This report presents the characteristics of stratified mixture for- mation and combustion, especially the important factor for achiev- ing stable stratified combustion in the high-speed region, which have been clarified through analytical studies. For mixture forma- tion analysis, spray behavior was observed by photographing the forward-scattered light from spray particles; local fuel mixture con- centration in the piston cavity was measured using a fast response FID. For combustion characteristics analysis, flame propagation was measured by the ion current analysis, and frame behavior was observed by radical luminescence measurement using a high-speed multi-spectral video camera. Furthermore, in-cylinder air flow dynamics, which have a significant influence on mixture formation, were measured by the Particle-Image-Velocimetry(PIV) method using endoscope observation. These analyses have revealed that, the newly developed system achieves stable stratified combustion in the high-speed region due to optimized the piston cavity shape and fuel spray characteristics, especially suitable spray penetration with high injection pressure which provides ensuring the mixture formation to be "robust" against air flow and accelerating mixture diffusion in the cavity. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0735. (SP-1584) Vehicle application of a 4-cylinder tumble DISI engine. Henning Baumgarten , Peter Bozelie, José Geiger , and Peter Wolters, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. SI engines with gasoline direct injection are currently the focus of development for almost all car manufacturers. After the introduc- tion of DISI engines, first to the Japanese market and after a short time delay also in Europe, a broad variety of technical solutions for efficient stratified concepts can be stated. The targets of the development activities in this field are defined by legislation and customer's demands. The potential reduction of fuel consumption with stratified operation has to be combined with a further improvement of the full load potential of the DISI engine. A substantial part of the development activities are the fulfillment of current and future emission standards. Therefore, in order to real- ize a highly efficient lean operation, new technologies and strategies in the field of exhaust gas aftertreatment and vehicle application are required. This paper presents characteristic results of the development pro- cess of a tumble based DISI combustion system obtained in different projects. Some important aspects of the combustion system will be discussed, but the presented results will concentrate mainly on the vehicle application of the DISI engine. Here, the specific potential and requirements of the DISI concept will be illustrated and dis- cussed in detail. 2001-01-0736. (SP-1584) Turbocharging a gasoline direct injection engine. Alain Ranini and Gaetan Monnier, Institut Fran- çais du Pétrole. Gasoline direct injection is one of the best way to reduce fuel consumption of spark-ignited engines. Stratified combustion has the advantage of drastically increasing the SI engine efficiency. However, whereas future pollution stan- dards become more restricting, it makes after-treatment of NOx emissions more difficult, especially since NOx traps require very low sulfur level in fuel. Thus, engines working with this type of combustion are expensive to be after-treated and actual consumption benefits on the urban cycles are significantly lower than theoretical expectations without any pollution constraint. Homogeneous stoichiometric conditions present lots of advan- tages. Aftertreatment can be easily achieved without too expensive systems and applications of this combustion mode on current natu- rally aspirated engines show high volumetric efficiency and com- pression ratio in comparison with intake port injection. Gasoline direct injection engine has a lower knocking sensitivity, which is a main advantage in supercharging applications which allow to pull down consumption levels by downsizing. This paper presents a development based on the Renault 2.0-liter "IDE" engine with a new type of turbocharger using twin-scroll housing and fixed turbine geometry. Two high compression ratios and several intake valve timings with early and late valve openings have been considered to study their respective influence on perfor- mances, fuel consumption and pollutants emissions levels. The high 102</page><page sequence="102">2001-01-0736-2001-01-0742 torque obtained at low engine speeds contribute to reduce vehicle fuel consumption by using longer gear ratio. Following are the whole results at part and full load of the engine with a reduced engine displacement of 1.8 liter. Thus, this engine with high knock resistance would be able to overtake a typical 3.0- liter naturally aspirated engine performance. It has to be noticed that BMEP higher than 22 bar at 2000 rpm have been reached with a compression ratio of 10.0:1. 2001-01-0737. (SP-1584) Combustion improvement and exhaust emissions characteristics in a direct injection natural gas engine by throttling and exhaust gas recirculation. Yuichi Goto and Yoshio Sato, Ministry of Transport. A natural gas direct injection test engine equipped with a newly developed natural gas injector was built. High total hydrocarbon (THC) emission at part-load and high NOx emission at high-load remain as problems for direct injection natural gas engines. THC reduction and combustion improvement by throttling and NOx reduction by EGR were investigated. The following results were obtained: (1) the combustion at light- and medium-load conditions is improved by throttling. It is possible to improve the thermal effi- ciency at light-load in spite of the pumping loss by throttling. THC emissions are greatly decreased in this condition; (2) a large NOx reduction can be obtained without combustion deterioration by appropriate EGR at high-load conditions; and (3) it is possible to decrease both THC and NOx emissions by both throttling and EGR at part-load conditions. 2001-01-0738. (SP-1584) Numerical study of mixture forma- tion and combustion processes in a direct injection gasoline engine with fan-shaped spray. Yoshihiro Nomura, Hiroshi Miya- gawa, and Taketoshi Fujikawa, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc.; and Terutoshi Tomoda, Masato Kubota, and Shizuo Abe, Toyota Motor Corp. Numerical 3-D simulations are performed for the improvement of the new direct injection gasoline engine. A solution based local grid refinement method has been developed in order to reduce the CPU time. This method has been incorporated into the CFD pro- gram (STAR-CD) with in-house spray and combustion models. Cal- culation results were compared with the experimental data taken by the LIF technique, and good agreement was obtained for the mixture formation and combustion processes. Some calculations were car- ried out for the fuel-air mixture formation process during late injec- tion stratified combustion and the following results were obtained. The unburnt fuel has a tendency to remain in the side of the piston cavity at the latter part of the combustion period. To reduce the amount of unburnt fuel, it was shown that the combination of a thin thickness fan spray and compact cavity forms a spherical mixture, suitable for combustion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0739. (SP- 1611) Self-bonding liquid silicone rubber technology for various rigid substrates. Frank Burkus and Adam Conklin, General Electric Silicones ; and Stefan Bosshammer and Enno Henze, General Electric Bayer Silicones. Liquid silicone rubber (LSR) typically displays superior physical properties relative to other soft or flexible materials (e.g., thermo- plastic elastomers), but highly efficient production of rigid parts with silicone rubber over-molded as a flexible coating has been dif- ficult to achieve based on the adhesion characteristics of silicone elastomers. Historically this difficulty has been overcome by incor- porating external adhesion promoters and/or mechanical locks into the manufacturing process of the part. Based on recent work, the need for external adhesion promoters or mechanical fasteners has been eliminated by the development of new LSR formulations that exhibit primer-less adhesion to a large variety of substrates. This paper will describe three new self-bonding LSR grades and includes adhesion data for a variety of different rigid substrates used in auto- motive applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0740.

J. Mitchell, DuPont Canada, Inc. Ethylene/acrylic elastomers (AEM) are used in automotive appli- cations requiring resistance to service fluids over a broad tempera- ture range. Developments are underway to modify AEM elastomers to extend their performance capabilities. Modifications are directed at enhancing low-temperature flexibility, resistance to service flu- ids, and adhesion to reinforcing fibers without sacrificing existing performance characteristics. Other modifications are directed toward improved damping characteristics and the development of fast-curing copolymers that can be formulated to eliminate the need for post cure. The results and status of these developments are reviewed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0741. (SP- 161 1) A comparison of methods for testing rubber materials in automatic transmission fluids. S. J. Mecham, H. Aguilar, and B. L. Lang, ACADIA Polymers. Rubber material testing in automatic transmission fluids is tradi- tionally done using ASTM D471. This test was designed to be an accelerated test and does not best simulate the transmission environ- ment. An initial comparison of the ASTM test to three specially designed tests is presented here. The objective is to evaluate the tests with data from different fluids and rubber materials and identify the best laboratory method of determining the long-term behavior of a rubber compound in an automotive transmission. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0742. (SP-1611) Compression stress relaxation testing - Comparisons, methods, and correlations. Paul Tuckner, Dyneon. Compression Stress Relaxation (CSR) continues to be an impor- tant attribute in the evaluation of materials and seal configurations for their ability to provide sealing force retention under a range of conditions. As the emphasis on sealing becomes more important with increasing emphasis on performance capability and long term durability, the importance of accurate CSR performance becomes a primary concern. The objective of this work is to develop accurate, reproducible tests for CSR that are scaleable and can be used to predict long-term sealing performance. Although compression set resistance has been used in the past to provide useful comparisons of materials or to insure quality control of materials, it does not accurately reflect seal- ing force retention as it relates to actual applications. Some compari- sons between these two tests will be discussed. CSR data is only of value if different test fixtures, using different samples, with different test equipment provide the same results. Unless CSR data can be shown to be consistent over all these vari- ables, it is questionable whether it can be used for comparison or specification purposes. Data will be presented to compare these variables. SAE Paper 2000-01-0752 described the advantages and limita- tions of different CSR testers and jigs, along with some comparisons of preliminary test data. This paper will present actual CSR compar- isons using different test jigs in a few fluids at different tempera- tures. Comments will be made with respect to the performance of each of the jigs and samples, and how they compare. Throughout this paper I will be referring to different CSR test jigs and samples. The samples from left to right in the foreground are the 29 mm disc, 19 mm washer, -214 O-ring, and 13 mm disc. In the same order are the Jones-Odom (JO), Shawbury Wallace (SW), Jamak, Modified Wykeham Farrance (Dyneon) O-ring, and the Dyneon test jigs.

(SP- 1611) Application of thermoplastic elasto- mers as sealing materials. Shipra Kothari, Vi-Chem Corp.; and Franck Ruel , Thermoplastiques Cousin Tessier. In recent years, thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs), due to their ease of processability, performance and lower part cost, have begun to replace conventional thermoset rubbers. The functional advan- tages are due to the materials themselves as well as the design advantages these materials offer over thermoset materials. This paper will examine some material properties relevant to the part performance. Most specifications for sealing applications are based on short-term compression set. The paper will show the criti- cality of appropriate time and temperature specifications for elasto- meric behavior. Data of Vi-Chem' s Sevrene TPE will be used to demonstrate the suitability of this type of material for different sealing applications. 2001-01-0744. (SP- 1611) Wear indicator for wiper blades. F. Broszniowski , Vale o Wiper Systems. For wiper systems, rubber-wiping elements are one of the key components ensuring excellent wipe quality and, therefore, satisfy- ing driver visibility, security and comfort. In order to track the rub- ber element wear precisely and to know when the blades have to be changed, a wear indicator for the rubber element has been devel- oped. The indicator is made of a black plastic material with an adhe- sive, pressure sensitive, backing located on the main bow. With time and external stresses, the sticker turns a green color at mid life, and yellow at the end of life. Yellow color indicates to the driver, the end of the effective life of the wiper blade. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0745. Dynamic wheel load measurements on real road surfaces - What accuracy to expect? Walter Weiblen, Inter- national Consulting Engineering Services (ICES); Hans Burkard, Andreas Sidler, and Peter Wolfer, Kistler Instrumente AG; and Wolfgang Mayer , Research Institute of Automotive Engineering and Vehicle Engines (FKFS). In recent years we have seen drastic improvements of the accu- racy of wheel force transducer (WFT) systems. These systems in most cases are calibrated just statically. What is the dynamic behav- ior of the sensor? What can we expect towards the accuracy of the measured loads on real road surfaces as they are influenced by a number of parameters? In the present paper, quantitative results are reported out of a broad investigation of the effects of the following parameters: road surface, rim stiffness, tire air pressure, velocity, and wet road condi- tions. The unique Wheel and Tire Testing Vehicle ("Universal Skid Resistance Measurement Device") of Stuttgart University was used for the measurements on two highways. The WFT-signals are refer- enced to the multiaxial force sensing of this vehicle. These findings are compared to results derived from a rolling road flatbelt test stand. With the reported results dynamic wheel load measurements can be more precisely evaluated from an engineering standpoint. Thus innovation and optimization in the fields of WFT application will be further fostered. 2001-01-0747. New dynamic tire model in multi-body envi- ronment. Federico Mancosu, Carlo Savi, and Paolo Brivio, Pirelli Pneumatici; and GianClaudio Travaglio, and Isabel Ramirez, SEAT. A new Tire Model suitable for Tire Dynamic Representation on uneven road and in general high-frequency handling excitations has been developed in a multi-body code. The tire representation is both empirical and physical: contact forces between contact patch and road are achieved from numerical Pacejka formulation but applied to a physical structure representation instead of to a simple spring- damper element. Such a physical tire model enables the simulation of the dynamics up to 100 Hz and vibration due to high frequency handling maneuver or on uneven road contact excitation. Valida- tions with experimental results are of course included both for tire tests on suitable testrigs and for full vehicle maneuvers. 2001-01-0748. Tire modeling for misuse situations.

The design and processing of cast aluminum wheels for impact performance. Charles J. Russo, Amcast Auto- motive. This paper examines some processing and design factors which affect the impact performance of cast A356 aluminum wheels, as measured by SAE J175(13° lateral impact test). Wheel impact per- formance is discussed with respect to two different failure criteria: (a) failure due to cracking in the hub or spokes, and (b) failure due to total loss of tire air pressure. The general influence of heat treat- ment on impact behavior is described, and then examined in light of a particular wheel example. Peak-aging heat treatments are com- pared with underaging treatments, in terms of the critical link between processing, material properties of strength and ductility, and their influence on wheel impact behavior. The effects of the rim flange geometry and other design features are then explored, and illustrated with examples. Evaluation of wheel designs using dynamic, nonlinear FEA to calculate plastic strain is addressed throughout; and the use of high-speed video for analyzing failures and identifying crack initiation sequences is described. 2001-01-0750. Development of tooling for a lightweight steel Kühl wheel. Frank Fitz, Epilogics Group; and Thomas Heck, Hayes-Lemmerz International. Kühl Wheels utilize a system of offset, sheet steel spokes to form the structure between hub and rim. This allows a wheel with ade- quate strength to sustain radial, cornering and torque loads while providing weight as well as styling advantages. Initial development of welded prototype wheels is described, including laboratory and field test results. The development of a single piece, steel, stamped wheel center based on the early prototypes is described. Critical aspects of the design are shown and geometric requirements are dis- cussed. Wheel model analyses carried out by finite element methods are presented. Development of tooling and ultimately stamped pro- totypes is discussed and shown. Finally, test results from wheels assembled from the stamped wheel centers are presented and com- pared with the analytical predictions. 2001-01-0751. A study of tire lag property. Yongping Hou, Yujin Hu, and Chenggang Li, Huazhong University of Science and Technology ; and Konghui Guo, Jilin Univ. Tire lag property is a basic property of tire dynamics, and it has significant influence on the performance of vehicle dynamics. In distance domain, the side force and moments produced by a massless tire are basically displacement or path frequency depen- dent, rather than time dependent. In the paper, on the basis of the stretched-string model, the first-order filtering of deflection for the front point of the contact print and the first-order filtering of side force have been introduced. Tire system can be regarded as a first- order linear system under small slip angle. The force response of tire has the characteristics of the responses of first-order linear system under small angle. The relaxation length is an important parameter 104</page><page sequence="104">200 1 -0 1 -075 1 -200 1 -0 1 -076 1 in studying tire lag property. It decreases with increasing slip angle. It plays an important role in the study of tire transient properties. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0753. Improvement of hydroplaning performance based on water flow around tires. Tadashi Suzuki and Tatsuo Fujikawa , Japan Automobile Research Institute. The objective of this study is to improve tire hydroplaning per- formance by examining the arrangement of the tread grooves, based on water flow. It is important to smoothly channel the water through the tread grooves to improve performance. For this purpose, flow around the tire contact area was visualized by particle tracing. The velocity and the direction of flow in front of the contact area became clear as a vector map. This vector map indicated that the direction of the flow depends primarily on the lateral position, i.e., the dis- tance from the tread center. Tread grooves parallel to the flow vector were designed based on this result. The visualization of the improved tire demonstrated that water flowed smoothly along the grooves. In addition, a drum test indicated increased cornering force at high speed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0755. Testing study of temperature field in a rolling tire at various operating conditions. Qingnian Wang, Ziliang Zhao, Youde Li, Li Jie, and Liang Chu, Jilin University of Technol- ogy ■ The objective of this study is to explore the temperature distribu- tion characteristics of a tire at various operating conditions (includ- ing speed, load, inflation pressure and ambient temperature) in prac- tice and to analyze the influence of operating conditions on tempera- ture rise of the tire. So, a new test system is demonstrated to measure temperature distribution in a rolling tire, with which the external surface temperature field of a domestic bias tire (9.00-20 14PR) has been measured at various operating conditions. The inside tempera- tures of particular points in the tire are measured by inserting ther- mocouple into drilled holes at the tire. Based on experimental results, the influence of operating conditions on tire temperature characteristics is analyzed. The experimental formula between the temperature rise and time at the shoulder on tire external surface is developed by regression analysis. 2001-01-0756.

This work outlines the evaluation of static and dynamic dent resistance of medium scale structural assemblies fabricated using AA6111 and AA5754. The assemblies fabricated attempt to mimic common automotive hood designs allowing for a parametric study of the support spacing, sheet thickness and panel curvature. Closure panels of AA61 1 1, of two thicknesses (0.8, and 0.9mm), are bonded to re-usable inner panels fabricated using AA5754 to form the struc- tural assemblies tested. While normal practice would use the same alloy for both the inner and the outer, in the current work, AA5754 was adopted for ease of welding. Numerical simulations were per- formed using LS DYNA. A comparison of experimental and numer- ically simulated results is presented. The study attempts to establish an understanding of the relationship between structural support con- ditions and resulting dent depths for both static and dynamic loading conditions. The differences between static and dynamic loading conditions are highlighted. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0758. A new FEA method for the evaluation of a body joint. Yuzhao Song, Dave Flanigan, Cliff Rivard, Behrooz Shahidi, and Christina Nguyen, Ford Motor Co. A finite element analysis method has been developed to assess the design of an automobile body joint. The concept of the coeffi- cient of joint stiffness and the force distribution ratio are proposed accordingly. The coefficient of joint stiffness reveals whether a joint is stiff enough compared to its joining components. In addition, these parameters can be used to estimate the potential and the effec- tiveness for any further improvement of the joint design. The model- ing and analysis of the proposed process are robust. The coefficient of joint stiffness could be further developed to serve as the joint design target. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0759. Analysis of a front integration frame. Paul Edward Cottrell, Hella-Behr Vehicle Systems, Inc. The purpose of this article is to provide a methodology in analyz- ing the Front Integration Frame (FIF). Since this structure is a key component to closing out the Body in White, one needs to analyze this structure as a singular and integral part of the front body struc- ture. A Design Verification and Report is a common methodology used to prove out a design before marketing. The more computer simulations that are adopted, in the analysis of the FIF before proto- typing, the less revisions will be needed due to design failure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0760. Analysis of different closeout structures for a FEM. Paul Edward Cottrell, Hella-Behr Vehicle Systems, Inc. The purpose of this analysis is to provide an understanding of the fundamentals of front structure deflection within four basic load cases; lateral, torsion, upward, and downward. Each case was ana- lyzed with eight different structure configurations. This provided understanding in the deflection behavior when certain structural members are removed. This imperative information will provide the essential structural characteristics of a front integration frame (FIF). This frame is the backbone of the front-end module design philosophy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0761. Car front end module structure development regarding pedestrian protection and other mechanical con- straints. Emmanuel Glasson, Valérie Maistre, and Claude Laurent, Faurecia. Vehicle front ends have evolved over the last 10 years into light- weight, low cost, high performance complete modules. Now, the development of such modules implies considering not only customers styling trends but also conflicting mechanical con- straints at different speeds. In one hand, a front end module must control fast loading under an insurance crash test in order not to deform the car structure, to minimize components damage and therefore reduce collision repair 105</page><page sequence="105">2001-01-0761-2001-01-0767 costs, whereas in the other hand, the front end module must provide enhanced occupant and pedestrian safety by absorbing energy in the most efficient way (vehicle to pole tests, EEVC WG 17 proposed subsystem tests). Still, the bumper must meet customers specifica- tions under low speed impacts. Faurecia, based on its wide experience and know-how in front end module design, has adapted its development tools in order to take into account occupant and pedestrian protection in the same time as low speed and insurance tests specifications. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the development of a front end module structure regarding pedestrian protection and to put for- ward the possible conflicts between pedestrian protection and struc- ture performance in crash when the vehicle environment (structure/ style) is more or less imposed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0762. A numerical approach of the problem of the safety model correlation in early design phase. Jean-Yves Jaskul- ski, Faurecia. In early design phase, model simulations are intended to repre- sent the global behavior of the investigated system. For this purpose, in the last decade, the use of multibody models has become general- ized in automotive safety. Nevertheless, the definition of these mod- els is not easy and need to be validated with experimental results (crash tests). Indeed, some of the model parameters are not directly identified with experimental procedures (subsystem tests) and those parameters need to be determined with the help of engineer know- how in a trial and error procedure. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a numerical approach employed in the parameter identification and in the correlation of the model on crash results. In the first part, we describe the modeling process which is employed in early design phase of vehicle interiors components. We then provide a description of the parameter identi- fication problematic and show what is at stake in the complexity management of the model correlation. In order to manage this com- plexity, we propose a numerical method based on a functional approach. This method is explained and, then, applied on different safety model correlations. 2001-01-0763. A method to improve the finite element repre- sentation of joints in hybrid models of vehicle structures. S. Edward Law, DaimlerChrysler Corp. An overview of some traditional and common techniques used in representing body and frame joints in finite element models will be presented. A historical review will be given on the evolution of different joint representation techniques. There are mainly two cate- gories of joint representations, matrix form and non-matrix form, but there are many variations. Advantages and disadvantages of each technique from the two categories will be discussed. The pur- pose of parametric models will be reviewed and ways to improve its effectiveness in influencing the design during the early concept stage will be discussed. An improved joint representation technique will be outlined which uses static condensation to a matrix with improved beam / shell element interface. The use of this matrix to arrive at a correc- tion matrix is proposed that can be added to any joint representation that the analyst prefers. This is a hybrid approach because it uses a non-matrix representation with a correction matrix. The advan- tages of such an approach will be discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0764. Effective computer-aided engineering in the automotive product development stages. Robert G. Dubensky, DaimlerChrysler. This paper shows how the automotive product development pro- cess is presented in four distinct stages. The specific type of task, to be presented at each stage, is discussed. Specific CAE (Comput- er- Aided Engineering) tasks, such as FEA (Finite Element Analy- sis), to be used at each stage are discussed. Detailed steps to follow are presented, as well as a check list of tasks are included. The changes and increased effectiveness (developed over 15 years of uti- lization) are discussed. 2001-01-0765. Modeling of bicycle rider collision kinematics. Stephen Werner, William Newberry, and Robert Fijan, Exponent Failure Analysis Associates, Inc.; and Mark Winter, Rock Shox, Inc. A MADYMO simulation model was created to analyze the kine- matics of a bicycle rider during a frontal collision with a rigid object. The model was validated using a series of crash tests in which rider trajectory was captured with high-speed photography. The test bicy- cles were equipped with either traditional fixed or suspension front forks. Impact speeds varied from 22.5 to 31.0 kph to cover a range of fork response from minor bending to significant bending and fracture. The predictions of simple particle trajectory analysis were found to approximate rider motion. Rider motion was relatively unaffected by hand and foot "connections" to the bicycle. Further- more, the rider connection to the bicycle was insufficient to create any significant rider deceleration as a result of bicycle fork deformation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0766. Machinabilty of advanced ceramic for CAD- CAM applications. K. L. Chelule, Staffordshire Univ.; T. Coole, Buckinghamshire Chilterns Univ.; and D. G. Cheshire, Stafford- shire Univ. In almost all-manufacturing processes, there is a trade-off between cost and quality. Parameters that indicate quality include surface texture, dimensional accuracy, mechanical properties and uniformity of physical appearance. Unfortunately, parts with good surface finish, precise geometry and high mechanical strength are usually the most expensive to produce. In order to achieve high quality components at reasonable cost, optimization of machining is essential. This is usually accomplished by judicious selection of proper cutting tool, cutting method, and the various cutting parame- ters that control the process. It is the intention of this paper to demonstrate research efforts aimed at characterizing and machining of C APT AL' 90', a hydrox- yapatite (HA) material-suitable for human bone tissue replacement. It is expected that experimental knowledge gained and the results will form basis for modification of hydroxyapatite material for bet- ter machining performance. Guidelines for future machining of hydroxyapatite and other related advanced ceramic materials are proposed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0767. An investigation of thermal effects on the Hybrid III thorax utilizing finite element method. Matthew J. Pettibone, Gary Heydinger, and Dennis A. Guenther, Ohio State Univ.; and C. Brian Tanner, and John F. Wiechel, S. E. A., Inc. The advent of the Hybrid III crash test dummy marked the begin- ning of biofidelic anthropomorphic test devices. During the devel- opment of its critical components, notably the head, neck, knee, and thorax, biomechanical cadaver test results were incorporated into the design. The result was a dummy that represented the 50th per- centile male during idealized impacts. In order to achieve a more biofidelic response from the compo- nents, many exotic materials and unique designs were utilized. The thorax, for instance, incorporates a spring steel rib design laminated with a viscoelastic polymeric composite material to damp the response. This combination results in the proper hysteretic losses necessary to model the human thorax under impact loading condi- tions. The disadvantage of this design is that the damping material properties are highly sensitive to temperature. A variation of more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit dramatically affects the response of the thorax. Under the hot photographic lights associated with crash test- ing, it is difficult to maintain the mandated 70 degree to 72 degree Fahrenheit dummy temperature window. 106</page><page sequence="106">2001-01-0767-2001-01-0777 To examine the cause of temperature dependence, physical test- ing was performed on individual Hybrid III ribs to characterize the damping material, and a finite element model was formulated. Results from both the physical testing and the simulations using the finite element model showed 20 to 30% variation in sternal deflec- tion over a temperature of 63 to 78 degrees Fahrenheit. Close exami- nation of the damping material characterization showed that its Young's Modulus dropped nearly an entire order of magnitude across the temperature range. This variation greatly affected the overall stiffness of the rib during impact and is the leading cause of the thorax temperature dependence. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0768. First order analysis - New CAE tools for auto- motive body designers. Hidekazu Nishigaki, Shinji Nishiwaki, Tat- suyuki Amago , and Yoshio Kojima , Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc.; and N oboru Kikuchi , University of Michigan. Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) has been successfully uti- lized in automotive industries. CAE numerically estimates the per- formance of automobiles and proposes alternative ideas that lead to the higher performance without building prototypes. Most automo- tive designers, however, cannot directly use CAE due to the sophis- ticated operations. In this paper, we propose a new breed of CAE, First Order Analysis (FOA), for automotive body designers. The basic ideas include (1) graphic interfaces using Microsoft/Excel to achieve a product-oriented analysis (2) use of mechanics of materi- als to provide the useful information for designs, (3) the topology optimization method using function oriented elements. Further, some prototypes of software are presented to confirm the method for FOA presented here. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0769. E-tools for automotive engineers. Randy May- nard and Todd A. Hoff, GE Plastics Automotive. The Internet is changing the way the automotive industry does business and how automotive suppliers are supporting the automo- tive OEM's. This paper will discuss some "e-tools" that are cur- rently available for automotive engineers to use, and the direction that future "e-tools" such as these are heading. These "e-tools" or "wizards" compliment traditional CAE system analyses by dissect- ing the problem into smaller, geometrically and mathematically sim- pler analyses that can be done quickly using the Internet. This paper will discuss a few of these "wizards" and where, when and how these tools can be applied to the tasks that automotive prod- uct engineers face on a daily basis. Examples will be used to demon- strate the speed, versatility, and functionality of these "wizards." 2001-01-0771. The impact of new technologies and tools on the vehicle and engine development process. U. Oligschläger and Th. Wagner , FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. Technological progress opens the door for the development of new tools to be used for the development of vehicles and engines. This offers the opportunity for an optimization of the entire work- flow on one hand, and an improvement of single tasks on the other hand. This paper describes the actual status of the development pro- cess, describes new directions of tool evolvement and finally gives an outlook into the future. Redline AD APT-SIM is a tool for driver and vehicle simulation, which was developed primarily for ECU application, but can also be used for other dynamic testing tasks. The introduction of this tool leads to better controllability and therefore also repeatability of tests. 2001-01-0773. Analysis tools for design engineers. Paul M. Kurowski , Design Generator Inc. The successful use of analysis by design engineers during the product development process strongly depends on the choice of those analysis tools that offer easy integration with CAD and pro- vide reliable results, while not requiring an in-depth expertise in analysis. The intention of this paper is to assist in choosing those tools that are best suited for use by design engineers. We start with a summary of differences between analysis performed by a design engineer and by an analyst. Next, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of commercially available analysis methods, from the point of view of design engineers. In conclusion we recommend that design engineers use either the p method of the Finite Element Analysis or the Precise Solids Method and offer hints as to which one is advantageous depending on particular analysis problem. 2001-01-0775. Vibration of automotive bucks to 500 Hz and higher. Robert M. Turner , Environmental Screening Technology , Inc.; and R. Christopher Trendov , DaimlerChrysler Corp. This paper describes a new process for vibrating large automo- tive bucks (body in white) to 500 Hz and higher. This process uti- lizes multiple electrodynamic shakers driving large magnesium mounting plates. The vertical axis utilizes three large head shakers driving a common magnesium plate 12 ft. long x 4 ft. wide. The shakers are dynamically matched, and the input a feedback signal is paralleled. This approach coupled with a closed loop digital vibra- tion controller offers excellent dynamic uniformity to better than 500 Hz to the buck under test. The fore/aft and lateral utilize two shakers driving a common 12 ft. x 4 ft. magnesium slip plate. In the lateral, the shakers are side by side; and in the fore/aft, they are in a push-pull configuration. This approach offers control and spec- trum tailoring to 500 Hz or higher. This method is dynamically superior over single shaker input and four poster shakers because the buck under test is seeing homogeneous vibration to 500 Hz. Dynamically it looks like two or three small plates rather than one large plate, without severe anti-resonances and resonances within the 500 Hz range. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0776. Battery simulation. Peter Schintag, Wolfgang Reimann , and Ingo Krüger , IAV GmbH. Battery simulation by a DSP-controlled high current power sup- ply is used to improve repeatability and comparability of starting tests, especially at low temperatures. The simulator's algorithm cal- culates the internal resistance of the battery by a timely constant resistor and a variable resistor representing the actual discharge his- tory. The output voltage of the simulator is set as a function of inter- nal resistor and load current with temperature and state of charge as setup parameter. 2001-01-0777. A verification study for cam phaser position control using robust engineering techniques. Jeffrey Pfeiffer , Matthew J. Kulpa , Ken Simpson , Dennis Reed , and Joon-Ho Yoo , Delphi Automotive Systems. This paper describes the verification and comparison of position control algorithms for a continuously-variable cam phaser. Robust Engineering techniques are used. Two non-linear PID control algo- rithms are designed to control cam phaser position. The first algo- rithm is a more complex control strategy while the second is a thrifted approach that seeks to reduce throughput requirements. An Lis orthogonal array is established with noise factors that affect the quality of cam phaser control. Using the orthogonal array, the num- ber of experiment test points required to characterize the control algorithm response is reduced from 8,748 to thirty-six. The test points of the orthogonal array are investigated experimentally on a motored engine outfitted with cam phaser hardware. The desired and actual cam position data are compared and analyzed for all points in the orthogonal array. Both control algorithms result in sim- ilar signal to noise ratios for the bench testing, showing the thrifted control algorithm to perform similarly overall. A final verification of the control algorithms is performed on a vehicle with a complete 107</page><page sequence="107">2001-01-0777-2001-01-0794 engine management system. The more complex control algorithm is shown to yield superior performance in the vehicle-level evaluation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0779. An accelerated test method for automotive wiper systems. Sandrine Lesterlin and Frédéric Surdel, Valeo Wiper systems. This paper will present an Accelerated testing method, which has been developed for wiper systems. The main objectives are to run the product to failure in a minimal time period and to reproduce the typical life test failures. A better understanding of the correlation between the damage (leading to the defection of the product) and the operating conditions (speed, temperature...) was the basis of this test method. In this paper, the main focus was on the arm and blade sub-system. Field test and Laboratory test data dictate the require- ments for the assembly of a test bench. This test bench system allows us to control the influential experimental parameters and occupies a small room area, while testing a large number of samples. The displacement (motion) of the samples is created using pneu- matic actuators and the test conditions are computer controlled and monitored. The frequency, the duration, the shaft torque are recorded during the tests. The larger number of samples combined with computer control allowed a statistical treatment of the results and reliable calculations. Two methods have been adapted to ensure the reproduction of the field conditions on the test bench, these are utilization of strain gages and cracking varnish. Strain gages and cracking varnish showed the correlation between stress and effort on a partial car (buck) and on the test bench. 2001-01-0784. Electricity flow analysis in the series hybrid system by the charge-discharge tester. Morimasa Hayashida and Kazuyuki Narusawa, Traffic Safety and Nuisance Research Insti- tute; and Yushi Kamiya, Gunma Univ. In this study, the series hybrid electric system is recommended as suitable power systems of the motor vehicles in urban area. It is important for this system to improve the comprehensive energy effi- ciency when components are combined, and to evaluate it appropri- ately. In this report, the technique to grasp energy loss in detail that occurs when electric power flows complicatedly in the series hybrid power system has been examined and the energy efficiency of the series hybrid power system on urban driving has also been evaluated. 2001-01-0787. Optimizing load transducer design using com- puter-based analytical tools. Richard A. Meyer and Malcolm C. Sharp, MTS Systems Corp. Rapid development of advanced multi-axial load transducer sys- tems now requires the use of computer-based analytical tools to assist the development engineer optimize the design to meet often- conflicting design targets. This paper presents a case study based on the development of a wheel force load transducer to meet a chal- lenging set of performance goals including accuracy, repeatability, durability and insensitivity to the external environment. The paper also highlights the limitations of some of the current analytical tools when used for load transducer design, and how these limitations can be overcome by cost-effective combinations of analytical perfor- mance prediction and physical test confirmation. 2001-01-0790. Dynamic force measurement system (DFMS) for tires. Gerald R. Potts, Test Measurement Systems, Inc. ; and Eric F. Knuth, Bridge stone/Fire stone, Inc. Tire force generation and transmission properties have been stud- ied over the past 50 years with increased precision and fidelity, with the major physical limitation being the dynamic response bandwidth of the force measuring system. The principles and data presented demonstrate a method of vibration measurement that can allow the separation of machine and tire contributions to the load cell mea- sured forces, thus the extraction of tire signatures. This technique has produced calibrated force measurements that are flat from 0 - 1100 Hz. Tire test data and machine calibration data for passenger tires are shown, both with and without DFMS analysis, demonstrat- ing a significantly increased bandwidth in tire force measurements. 2001-01-0792. Inertia measurements of large military vehi- cles. Dale A. Andreatta, Gary J. Heydinger, Ronald A. Bixel, and David A. Coovert, S.E.A., Inc. This paper describes the design and operation of a facility for measuring vehicle center-of-gravity height; roll, pitch, and yaw moments of inertia; and roll/yaw cross product of inertia for a broad range of test specimens. The facility is configurable such that it is capable of measuring these properties for light, single axle trailers; long, heavy vehicles; and tank turrets. The design was driven by the need for accurate, repeatable measurement results and the desire to have a single facility capable of making measurements on a broad range of vehicle sizes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0793. Rotating wheel torque meter with telemetrie data transmission. Thomas Berther and Hans Burkard, KISTLER Instrumente AG Winterthur. A new system has been developed for measuring the driving and braking torques acting on passenger car wheels. The RWT (Rotating Wheel Torquemeter) is intended above all for vehicle dynamics applications, particularly the development of control systems for dynamic stability, traction control and ABS, as well as investiga- tions of brake fade, brake judder, measurement of transmitted power and determination of friction values, coast down characteristics, and safety tests. The modular system consists of three main components: The torque sensor, the transceiver head for telemetrie signal transmission and the control unit located in the vehicle. The torque-sensing device can be fitted to the vehicle with the aid of hub and rim adapt- ers. This allows rapid installation to different vehicles. The torque measurement is achieved via piezoelectric quartz force sensors. In addition to the torque signal, there is provision on the rotating ele- ment of the My sensor for installing four K-type thermocouple ele- ments, e.g., for monitoring temperatures on the brake disk. The measured data are sent from the transceiver head by telemet- rie signal transmission to the control unit in the vehicle. The trans- ceiver head includes all components for the data acquisition, teleme- try and telecommand. The power is supplied by batteries. The control unit consists of a 32-bit processor and digital-, serial-, CAN- and analogue interfaces. Radio frequency links, based on a DECT transceiver module, as used in cordless phones, are set up between the control unit and the transceiver heads attached to the system. One control unit can serve up to four transceiver heads. User access for commands and measured data is possible through CAN and RS232 interface. Analogue data output is also available. The layout of the measuring system, technical data and examples of typical measurements are presented. 2001-01-0794. Test-bench for measurement of leak-flow rate of MAC compressors. D. Clodic and F. F ay olle, Ecole des Mines De Paris. The Center for Energy Studies, with a financial support by ADEME (French Agency for Environment and Energy Manage- ment), has realized a test bench for the measurement of R-134a leak flow rates of Mobile Air Conditioning) MAC components. The test bench is equipped with an infrared spectrophotometer permitting thorough and fast measurements. The measurement prin- ciple is simple. R-134a pressure is generated in gas phase in the component to be tested (in the study, the compressor). This compo- nent is located in a leak tight control volume at atmospheric pres- sure. The control volume is filled in recomposed air as to prevent any external pollution. 108</page><page sequence="108">2001-01-0794-2001-01-0801 The control volume is swept by a continuous flow permitting continuous measurement of the R-134a concentration in the mea- surement cell. Knowing the concentration increase, the control vol- ume and the time, the concentration measure permits the calculation of the leak flow rate. One of the advantages of the measurement protocol is the contin- uous measure, which permits both the verification of the leak flow rate consistency and the accuracy improvement by longer measure- ment time. However first acceptable values can be obtained after 10 minutes and ± 10 % accuracy after two hours. The test bench was designed for the leak flow rate measurement of compressors both idle and rotating. The learning process led to design an additional cooling system of the control cell when the compressor is driven by the motor located in the control cell. Tests indicated very high resistant torques, in particular when the compressor is cold. This limited the maximum testing speed at 2500 rpm. However a series of key results have been obtained and are presented in this paper. 2001-01-0795. Development of high-quality multi-axial sens- ing system (MASS) for direct measurement of 4 directional forces and coefficient of friction in real time. Nagao Miyazaki , Shu Ueno , Hajime Tamaki, Ryoji Hironaka , Tomohiro Yamaguchi , and Chunliang Li, Japan Electronics Industry Ltd. A high-performance sensor system called Multi-Axial Sensing System (MASS) has been established through a complete new con- cept, which is able to measure both the coefficient of friction and the four directional forces in real time. A strain sensor designed to meet the requirement of the system, was installed in the Neutral Spots and provided with good sensing properties. A precise static test machine and a road /tire test vehicle for evaluating the system have been also developed and manufactured. Enough performance has been completed to obtain the crosstalk of one directional force to the other directional forces in less than 1 percentage, while the measurement data had be obtained in the interval of 0. 1 milliseconds precisely. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0796. Virtual sensors of tire pressure and road fric- tion. Fredrik Gustaf sson, Linköping Univ.; and Markus Drevo, 'Wrban Forsseil, Mats Lofgrën, Nielas Persson, and Henrik Quick- lund, NIRA Dynamics AB. The idea of a virtual sensor is to extract information of parame- ters that cannot be measured directly, or at least would require very costly sensors, by only using available information. Virtual sensors are described for the friction between road and tire, the tire inflation pressure and wheel imbalance. There are certain in-terconnections between these virtual sensors so they are preferably implemented in one unit. Results from a real-time implementation, using mainly sensor in-formation from the CAN bus, are given. 2001-01-0797. (SP- 1593) Development of a lane-keeping sup- port system. Hiroshi Kawazoe, Takuya Murakami, On Sadano, Katsuhiro Suda, and Hitoshi Ono, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes a lane-keeping support system that has been developed and implemented in a production model. This system uses a CCD camera unit to recognize white lane markers on the road ahead and to calculate the host vehicle's lateral displacement from the center of its lane. An electronic control unit calculates the amount of steering torque needed to keep the vehicle in the center and sends a signal to a steering actuator that steers the front wheels. The electronic control unit has been designed on the basis of analy- ses of vehicle behavior and drivers' steering behavior. A general outline of the system is presented along with the results of driving simulations and actual driving tests. The results of evaluations con- ducted on a proving ground course and with a driving simulator have confirmed that this system is effective in reducing the driver's workload. 2001-01-0798. (SP- 1593) Development of an adaptive cruise control system with stop-and-go capability. Yoshinori Yamamura, Masahiko Tabe, Minoru Kanehira, and Takuya Murakami, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. An Adaptive Cruise Control system with stop-and-go capability has been developed to reduce the driver's workload in traffic jams on expressways. Based on an analysis of driving behavior character- istics in expressway traffic jams, a control system capable of model- ing those characteristics accurately has been constructed to provide natural vehicle behavior in low-speed driving. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated with an experimental vehicle, and the results confirmed that it reduces the driver's workload. This paper presents an outline of the system and its effectiveness along with the experimental results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0799. (SP- 1593) Estimation of road configuration and vehicle attitude by lane detection for a lane-keeping system. Masafumi Tsuji, Ryota Shirato, Hiroshi Furusho, and Kiyoshi Akutagawa, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes an image-processing system for tracking a traffic lane by recognizing white lines on the road ahead. The system utilizes the features of the white lines and the Hough transformation to detect white line candidate points in images taken with a CCD camera. The parameters of the road configuration and vehicle atti- tude are estimated with an extended Kaiman filter. This system has been applied to achieve a lane-keeping assistance system that pro- vides steering control based on the host vehicle's lateral position in its lane. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0800. (SP- 1593) Fusion sensor for an assist system for low speed in traffic congestion using millimeter-wave radar and an image recognition sensor. Hirofumi Higashida, Ryuichi Nakamura, Masaki Hitotsuya, Kanako F. Honda, and Nobukazu Shima, Fujitsu Ten Limited. A traffic congestion support system is one of the remarkable driving safety features in ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) tech- nology. We have developed a fusion sensor, combining a millime- ter-wave radar and a stereo camera, for use as a forward recognition sensor that is an integral part of the system. The fusion sensor is introduced below. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0801. (SP- 1593) Remote-controlled vehicle platoon- ing via state estimation in a communication network. Jae W eon Choi, Tae Hyun Fang, and Young Ho Kim, Pusan National Univ. In this paper, a platoon merging control system is considered as a remotely located system with state represented by a stochastic pro- cess. In this system, it is common to encounter situations where a single decision maker controls a large number of subsystems, and observation and control signals are sent over a communication chan- nel with finite capacity and significant transmission delays. Unlike classical estimation problem where the observation is a continuous process corrupted by additive noise, there is a constraint that the observation must be coded and transmitted over a digital communi- cation channel with finite capacity. A recursive coder-estimator sequence is a state estimation scheme based on observations trans- mitted with finite communication capacity constraint. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic model for the lead vehicle in a platoon of vehicles in a lane considering the angle between the road surface and a horizontal plane as a stochastic process. In order to merge two platoons, the lead vehicle of the following platoon is controlled by a remote control station.

(SP- 1593) Platooning rear vehicle control using vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Kenji Amada , Kazuyuki Kobayashi , and Kajiro Watanabe, Hosei Univ. A new concept for communication for platooning of leader- follower vehicles is presented. The leader vehicle is equipped by a omni directional camera and laser radar. The omni directional cam- era can capture a omni directional views and the view information is used to autonomously control the leader vehicle. The laser radar set to the rear part of the leader vehicle detects the relative distance and angle of the follower vehicle. By the information of the relative position and angle of the follower vehicle, control instructions are generated and sent via vehicle-to-vehicle communication between the leader vehicle and the follower vehicle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0803. (SP- 1593) High reliability collision avoidance radar using FM-pulsed doppler method. Naohisa Uehara, Koichi Kai , Shinichi Honma , Toshiyuki Takahara, and Masahira Akasu, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. The vehicular collision avoidance millimeter-wave radar that uses an FM-pulse doppler method is proposed. This radar is consti- tuted with the FM-CW radar method and the pulse doppler radar method. This radar method has combined the advantages that the precision of the measurements of distance and speed of the target that the FM-CW radar method provides, and the low target mis- recognition probability that the pulse doppler radar method pro- vides. The millimeter- wave radar using this method was produced using comparatively simple circuits. The experimental data that was obtained with this radar and with the FM-CW radar are compared with each other. The effectiveness of the FM-pulse doppler method was investigated using data obtained from on the road environment using a target vehicle and some objects. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0804. (SP-1593) Conflicting uses of data from pri- vate vehicle data systems. E. A. Garthe and N. K. Mango , Garthe Associates. The disclosure by General Motors Corporation in the spring of 1999 that private passenger vehicles record crash event data has lead to numerous proposals for the use of this data for engineering, crash research, liability, enforcement, traffic safety and medical uses. Many of these applications are traditional "static" uses where the time frame in which the data is collected is not critical to the use (within the bounds of a few days or weeks). Medical use of the data, however, for activation of EMS services and triage is a new "dy- namic" use that requires immediate access to the data in order to achieve results. Currently the static and dynamic uses of the data may conflict, with use in one area potentially inhibiting use in the other. This arises in principal part because of protections generally provided to data secured and maintained incident to providing medical care. The lead author of this paper is a member of the NHTSA's Event Data Recorder Working Group serving as a representative of the state of Massachusetts. In this paper, the authors are expressing their own opinions regarding the uses of the crash data. The purpose of the paper is to illustrate the challenges and oppor- tunities that are presented by the introduction of crash event data recorded from private vehicles. Issues covered include: The philosophical divide between differ- ent technologies: systems that record crash event data within the vehicle (EDR type) versus Telematic (ACN type) systems in which no data is permanently stored in the vehicle. Viewpoints on the own- ership of the data (driver, vehicle owner, manufacturer or govern- ment), and how this fits with previous precedent for similar data such as 911 calls and patient care reports. Technical information on the current vehicle data systems. Data collection efforts underway from vehicle data systems. The potential benefits and challenges for medical use of the data including summary information from an analysis of EMS &amp; Air Medical utilization in Massachusetts. The potential conflicts between enforcement and medical uses with respect to medical records and privacy rights are also discussed. The potential challenges to enforcement use if not all vehicles are equally equipped with recording systems. 2001-01-0805. (SP-1593) Implementation of human-like driv- ing for autonomous vehicle. Aoi Kawashima, Kazuyuki Kobayashi , and Kajiro Watanabe, Hosei Univ. The sensing and control scheme of autonomous vehicle, learned from the human driving is considered. To implement human driving manners, we imitate "characteristics of the human eye" and "human driving rules extracted from driver's feeling." Following two approaches are considered; 1. Reduction of image processing load of FFT picture compression technique by the manner of human eye sensitivity. 2. Simplified driving rules extracted from the human driving manner correspond to the energy minimum optimal control. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0806. (SP-1593) Map reconstruction in the indoor environment for the purpose of autonomous vehicle using laser radar. Kazuyuki Kobayashi, Shigenori Sugishita, and Kajiro Watanabe, Hosei Univ. This paper proposes how to develop an autonomous vehicle for factor and/or storehouse use. Where the geometric arrangement changes frequently due to the turnover of the cargo. We apply the sensor fusion technique by use of the Omni directional image sensor and laser radar generate the map of such situations. We propose a new update algorithm called SMT (Shift Matching Transform) that obtains region segments with trusted semi-real-time geometric map. We demonstrate how to determine the absolute position of the vehi- cle by the position information of arbitrary wall. Experimental results on the corridor, show the semi-real-time map reconstruction with enough validity. 2001-01-0807. (SP-1593) Development of active contour extraction for autonomous vehicle lane detection at outdoor environment. Kei Odagiri, Kazuyuki Kobayashi, and Kajiro Watanabe, Hosei Univ.; and Hideo U mino, and Nakaho Numata, Mitsubishi Motor Co. The project of the ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) has been actively promoted researches and developments for the safe and efficient traffic. In the project, development of the lane detection algorithm is indispensable. Under outdoor environment, it is very difficult to detect a lane and to distinguish the various obstacles by vision systems, due to optical problems. Here we propose the Active Contour Model Method, which is known as the most robust method to detect the lane contour. The vehicle based on an electric wheel- chair for handicapped persons was used to examine the validity of the method. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0809.

Under the brand name "Communiport," Delphi has been intro- ducing many new products into the mobile multi-media infotain- ment market. To date, each of these products have been uniquely designed with software tailored to the specific application. To meet the rapid time to market requirements, to develop the myriad of new products while keeping development resources to a minimum, to maximize reuse, and to establish an open architecture demanded by our customers, DDES is developing an open computing platform 110</page><page sequence="110">2001-01-0809-2001-01-0821 (OCP) for its next generation "Communiport" products. This paper describes the OCP, from both a hardware and software perspective; how we got there and where we are heading. Included for reference is an analysis of eleven systems from various customers. The heart of the OCP is the Hitachi SH-4 computer and compan- ion IC, the QSSL QNX Neutrino operating system, the Win CE operating system, and the Hewlett-Packard Chai Java Virtual Machine. Because the architecture is open, application programs from within DDES as well as third party vendors are accommodated. 2001-01-0810. (SP- 1593) An experimental study of destina- tion entry with an example automobile navigation system. Dean P. Chiang , Aaron M. Brooks , and David H. Weir , Dynamic Research , Inc. An over-the-road study of driver destination entry using an example in-dash GPS-based navigation system was accomplished in traffic on urban surface streets and freeways. The evaluation used typical drivers, and a vehicle instrumented to record driver control inputs, vehicle response motions including lateral lane position, and driver eye glances and fixations. The primary task was to follow the routes in a safe manner, while moving with traffic and maintaining speed and lateral lane position. As a secondary task, the drivers entered the successive destinations while driving, using a touch screen, and at their own pace. They were told there was no hurry, nor was there a need to enter the destination quickly. Results are shown for number of keystrokes, total fixation times, number of fix- ations on the device, fixation duration, lane keeping performance, and subjective ratings related to ease of destination entry. Overall, the drivers were able to accomplish the destination entry tasks with acceptably short glance durations on the navigation display, and with satisfactory subjective ratings for ease of entry. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-0811. (SP-1593) Analysis of vehicle speed measure- ment using magnetic loops. Ghassan E. Shahine , University of Michigan. A magnetic loop may be used to compute vehicle speed. In this paper, we will analyze magnetic loops similar to those installed on Michigan highways, which are relatively wide and diamond shaped. Speed computation using one loop is dependent on vehicle length, which may vary widely among different cars. This would produce extremely inaccurate results. We analyze another approach that rec- ommends the installation of two loops in succession. The distance between the two loops should be known and the loop controller yields the times the loops turn on. This approach yields vehicle speed as a function of the distance between the loops, the time the controllers turn on, and the inter-arrival time between them and hence it is independent of vehicle length. We analyze the situation where some vehicles may trigger the loops earlier than others because of higher mass concentration of metal in the front of the vehicle, and the situation where the two loops may not be exactly similar. 2001-01-0812. (SP-1593) System specifications of an afford- able area, highway, or route-specific incident-alerting system using RDS. Ghassan E. Shahine , University of Michigan. In this paper, we explore the system requirements and specifica- tions of an affordable traffic alerting system that pertains mainly to traffic exceptions as incidents, construction, and warnings. It is fea- sible to implement such a system since the infrastructure needed to rapidly detect the occurrence of incidents is available on most high- ways. Our concern here is with the rapid dissemination of incident information to the affected commuters. We review our proposed traffic alerting service, and then focus on the RDS technology as an affordable medium for disseminating incidents information. We design a software application suited for a traffic center, investigate the different Open Data Application (ODA) require- ments of the RDS radio, and propose an RDS transmission group structure that will carry a specific incident information reliably under the RDS limited bandwidth constraint. We also look at the format of the routes list stored in the RDS radio, the receiver mem- ory requirements, the routes file generation, and the search algo- rithm within the RDS radio for detecting incidents. 2001-01-0816. ITS design decision supporting systems based on user requirements. F. Ma and C. Nwagboso , University of Wol- verhampton. The paper describes a computer-based user focused systems design technique of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The design methodology will be supported by the ITS decision support- ing systems based on user requirements, which treats the design pro- cess as a total systematic framework that allows the designer to nav- igate through an optimum design route that underpins a user-focused and cost-effective total systems outcome. The systems design meth- odology starts with a comprehensive definition of user require- ments, followed by total systems design requirements and subse- quently transforms them into a physical architecture through various stages that engender the examination and analysis of the technolo- gies and generation of alternatives to satisfy those requirements. 2001-01-0818. (SP- 1622) The effect of porosity size on the fatigue properties in a cast 319 aluminum alloy. James M. Boi- leau and John E. Allison , Ford Motor Company Scientific Research Laboratories. A study was conducted to determine how the fatigue life of a 319 aluminum alloy (W319) was affected by pore size. To perform this study, two sets of microstructurally similar castings with differing levels of microporosity were created. Following room temperature fatigue testing, the pores that initiated fatigue cracks were identified and quantified. The results indicate that doubling the average initiat- ing pore diameter yielded an approximate 30% decrease in run-out stress in the W319-T7 aluminum alloy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0820.

The microstructure and properties of wheels made from a direct electrolytic Al-Si alloy (DEASA) have been studied. DEASA is characterized by self-modification and structural inheritance upon remelting. A lower level of modifier additive is required relative to conventional Al-Si alloys to produce a fully modified structure, resulting in sound castings. The wheels made from DEASA contain- ing 0.17-0.21 % (wt) Fe have lower cost and excellent impact resis- tance and endurance limit due to casting soundness. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0821. (SP- 1622) Hard anodic oxide coating on the piston-ring groove of a Cu-rich aluminum piston with mixed acid electrolytes. Hirotaka Kurita, Hiroshi Yamagata, and Toshikatsu Koike, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd.; and Ikuo Mita, Alumi- num Surface Finishing Laboratory. Hard anodic oxide coating (hard anodizing) technology giving hardness values above HV300 was developed for a piston alloy con- taining a high Cu concentration (Al-12%Si-4Cu-0.5Mg). This tech- nology was developed to improve the result that the anodic oxide coating in a sulfuric acid bath on the alloy can give hardness values as low as HV200. The combination of mixed acid electrolytes (40gL_1 oxalic acid and sulfuric acid less than ISOgL'1) and periodic reverse electrolyzing enables the piston-ring groove to form a hard anodic oxide coating film having hardness values above HV300, coating thickness of 20 pm, and surface roughness of Ra 2.0 pm. This mixed acid electrolyzing was found to prevent the electrochem- 111</page><page sequence="111">2001-01-0821-2001-01-0830 ical dissolution of Cu.

(SP- 1622) Forming of aluminum tailor welded blanks. Brad Kinsey, Vikram Viswanathan , and Jian Cao, North- western Univ. Tailor- welded blanks offer an excellent opportunity to reduce manufacturing costs, decrease vehicle weight, and improve the qual- ity of sheet metal stampings. However, tearing near the weld seam is a concern in Tailor- Welded Blanks due to material changes in the fusion and heat-affected zones of the weld. Therefore, data is required such as the potential strain of the material in these areas to use in the process design. For example, Cao and Kinsey proposed a modification to the deep drawing process where segmented dies with local adaptive controllers clamp adjacent to the weld line dur- ing the forming operation thereby reducing the strain in the material near the weld seam and in turn the concern of tearing failure. In order to aid in the design process for this modification, an under- standing of the effects of the welding process on material changes near the weld seam is essential. In this paper, Limit Dome Height data for aluminum 5182-H00 is presented to provide the potential principle strain in the material as well as initial experimental imple- mentation results of the proposed process modification on a non- symmetric test panel verifying the potential strain results from the Limit Dome Height tests. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0823.

This paper investigates the application of standard formability testing results for aluminum alloy tailor-welded blanks (TWB) to full-size stampings. The limit strains obtained from formability test- ing are compared to measured strains in a larger scale part. The mea- sured strains in the full-scale part are also compared to predictions from finite element simulation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0824. (SP- 1622) Simulation of electromagnetic form- ing of aluminum alloy sheet. Dino A. Oliveira and M. J. Worswick, University of Waterloo ; and M. Finn, Alean International Limited. Electromagnetic forming of aluminum alloys provides improved forming limits, minimal springback and rapid implementation. The ability to predict the minimum energy required in electromagnetic forming is essential in developing an efficient process. Understand- ing the development of the strain distribution over time in the blank is also highly desired. A numerical model is needed that offers insight into these areas and the electromagnetic forming process in general that cannot easily be extracted from experiments. To address these concerns, ANSYS/EMAG is used to model the time varying currents that are discharged through the coil in order to obtain the transient magnetic forces acting on the blank. The body forces caused by electromagnetic induction are then used as the boundary condition to model the high velocity deformation of the blank with LS-DYNA, an explicit dynamic finite element code. At present a "loose coupling" is employed between ANSYS/EMAG and LS-DYNA to update geometry and body forces as loading proceeds. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0825. (SP- 1622) Effect of process variables on the static and fatigue properties of self-piercing riveted joints in alu- minum alloy 5754. Maofeng Fu and P. K. Mallick, University of Michigan. Self-piercing riveting is a relatively new process for joining sheet metals in automotive applications. Its importance is growing in the automotive industry because of its advantages over spot-welding aluminum alloys. One of these advantages is the higher fatigue strength, which is useful in designing body structures. This paper presents experimental data on the effects of several process vari- ables, such as rivet diameter, rivet length, rivet hardness, sheet thickness and die shape, on the static and fatigue properties of self- piercing riveted joints in aluminum alloy 5754. Statistical analysis has been performed to examine the relative importance of these vari- ables on the static and fatigue performance of the joints. 2001-01-0827. Development of pitting resistant steel for transmission gears. Tsuyoshi Nakamura and Tomoki Hanyuda, Daido Steel Co., Ltd.; Makoto Yoshida, JATCO Trans Technology Ltd.; and Yoichi Murakami, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. It was found that pitting resistance of gears is strongly influenced by resistance to temper softening of carburized steel. The investiga- tion about the influence of chemical compositions on hardness after tempering revealed that silicon, chromium and molybdenum are effective elements to improve resistance to temper softening and pit- ting resistance. Considering the production of gears, molybdenum is unfavorable because it increases hardness of normalized or annealed condition. Developed new steel contains about 0.5 mass% of silicon and 2.7 mass % chromium. The new steel has excellent pitting resistance and wear resistance. Fatigue and impact strength are equivalent to conventional carburized steels. Cold-formability and machinability of the new steel are adequate for manufacturing gears because of its ordinary hardness before carburizing. The new steel has already been put to practical use in automatic transmission gears. Application test results are also reported. 2001-01-0828. Design tool on fatigue for 3D components with consideration of residual stresses. K. Gong, A. Milley, and J. Lu, Université de Technologie de Troyes. This paper presents a fatigue design tool for three-dimensional components with taking the residual stresses into account. The residual stresses are present in many mechanical components and play an important role in the fatigue problem of structure. By using the cyclic behaviors of material, a simplified method to calculate residual stress relaxation has been proposed in the first part of this paper. Secondly, a method to predict fatigue life with taking the sta- bilized residual stresses into account is presented. This design tool is based on the finite element method. It has been applied to shot- peened 35NCD16 grade steel. The different fatigue parameters often used in material research are studied. An experimental investigation about this material had been done by Bignonnet. The results of study show that this design tool on fatigue developed by LASMIS is able to take into account different loading parameters. 2001-01-0829. Thermal fatigue of automotive components. Vladimir Ogarevic, nCode International; Bruce Whittle, Ford Motor Co.; and Xiaobin Lin and Robin Anderson, nCode Interna- tional. Modern approaches for thermal fatigue damage assessment in automotive components are discussed. Three prominent methods are reviewed, and issues with related material testing, numerical imple- mentations and applications to general thermal cycles are presented. In summary, the chosen methods can produce good thermal fatigue life predictions. Common difficulties include first, prolonged exper- imental programs to determine the required material parameters, and second, significant computational times involved in analysis of real- istic models and loading histories. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0830. Evaluation of stress intensity factor-based pre- dictive technique for fatigue life of resistance spot welds. Jinmiao Zhang and Pingsha Dong, Batte lie; and Yi Gao, Corns Automotive Engineering. This paper summarizes the results of a recent study on a fatigue predictive technique for spot- welded automotive structures. The technique makes use of an equivalent stress intensity factor (Keq) as 112</page><page sequence="112">2001-01-0830-2001-01-0840 fatigue parameter for life predictions. A series of fatigue tests were conducted by using different types of fatigue specimens and weld arrangements. Using the raw test data collected, fatigue properties were processed in the form of AKeq versus fatigue life by a fracture mechanics based stress intensity factor technique. It is demonstrated that the fatigue properties are consistent among all the specimens tested and relatively geometry-independent. With the stress intensity factor based fatigue properties, the predictive technique was applied to more complex specimens with non-symmetric weld configura- tions and non-uniform loading conditions (resulting in mixed-mode loading on each weld). The results indicate good correlation between life predictions and test data. Finally, the results of a series of sensitivity studies are presented concerning the effects of various FE modeling details on the accuracy of the predictive technique. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0831. High frequency fatigue crack propagation behavior of a spheroidal graphite cast iron. Z. D. Sun and C. Bathias, CNAM/ITMA. Owing to the combination of high strength and good ductility, spheroidal graphite cast iron (SGI) has been widely used in the auto- motive industry. The application of the damage-tolerance design approach to the mechanical parts subjected to high-frequency vibra- tion loading necessitates a more reliable determination of crack propagation threshold. In this study, the fatigue crack propagation behavior of a SGI (ferrite in matrix with about 5% pearlite) was investigated experimentally at a frequency of 20 kHz and the stress ratio of R=-l and R=0.1. The propagation threshold was determined at a very slow rate of 10" 11 m/cycle. The results of these tests have been compared with those of conventional fatigue test. Effects of cyclic loading frequency have been discussed. It is shown that the threshold stress intensity value is smaller at ultrasonic frequency. The observations of the fracture surface at SEM show that there is less oxidation at very high frequency in all propagation regimes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0833. Effects of fatigue calculation parameters on the resulting tests generated from fatigue-hased editing. Paul J. Lubiński, E. Gail Guynn, Christine M. Simms, and David R. Woerner, ArvinMeritor, Inc. Building fatigue tests for components or systems involves deter- mining the loading content to use to attain a desired amount of pro- jected damage. A test-building process using field/proving ground histories or simulations thereof as the loading basis involves several decisions during fatigue calculation steps that could affect final test content. This paper quantifies the relative effects of fatigue analysis parameter decisions on test loads and test time. The parameters dis- cussed here include fatigue property parameters, "cutoff' levels, and scaling or notch factor application to strain data. Specific cases are presented to show how all these parameters affect the end tests. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0834. Improvement of fatigue strength of nitrided high-strength valve springs by application of a new super fine shot-peening technology. Yoshiro Yamada, Keiichiro Teratoko, Tadashi Saitoh, Hironobu Sasada, and Takashi Yanagihara , Suncall Corp. The peening of fine steel beads with diameters less than 80pm (referred to as SS Treatment in this paper) on the surface of nitrided and then conventionally shot-peened (with 0.6mm diameter cut steel wires) high-strength helical springs made from developed high- strength valve spring wire, was found to effectively improve spring fatigue strength. This improved fatigue strength is mainly the result of very high compressive residual stress caused by work hardening of the spring surface layer without inducing deleterious surface qualities such as harmful surface micro-fissuring or surface roughness. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0835. Review of CAE fatigue analysis techniques for spot-welded high strength steel automotive structures. Yi Gao, Corns Automotive Engineering; Darren Chucas, University of Wales; Colin Lewis, Corns Research, Development and Technol- ogy ; and Iain J. McGregor, Corns Automotive Engineering. Durability assessment of automotive structures with resistance spot welds is an important part of automotive development. Down- gauging of vehicle body structures permitted by high strength steels brings added challenges to joint design. As a result, more accurate fatigue life analysis of joints is called for by automotive engineers, especially as part of the computer-aided engineering (CAE) evalua- tions in the early stage of model development. This paper will review, evaluate and compare spot-weld fatigue assessment techniques suitable for use in the CAE environment. Particular attention is paid to the process of generating technique- specific spot- weld fatigue property curves. The focus is then switched to two of the most promising techniques, which are evalu- ated in detail. The validity of the two techniques and the associated fatigue data are then demonstrated on fatigue life predictions of sim- ple and complex components. Practical issues related to the proper use of the techniques are discussed. Comments are made on the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Finally, areas of improving the CAE durability tools for welded vehicle structures are proposed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0837. A computational methodology for fatigue life prediction under multiaxial non-proportional loading. Raj Mohan, Rouge Steel Co. A methodology for predicting the fatigue initiation life in metals experiencing multiaxial non-proportional loading is presented. The methodology utilizes nonlinear finite-element analysis to determine the stress distribution of the loaded component. This distribution is used in conjunction with a physically based damage law to deter- mine the cycles to failure. The damage law is based on the fatigue prediction method introduced by Dang Van, and further developed by Papadopoulos and Morel. The fatigue damage initiation is treated as the persistent crystalline slip phenomenon taking place on the order of a grain or few grains. The damage variable is chosen to be the accumulated plastic strain at this scale. The initiation life is determined when the damage variable reaches a critical value. The developed methodology is applicable to both in-phase and out-of- phase loading, without any empirical adjustment parameter. In order to validate the methodology, the predictions are compared with the experimental results on tension-torsion of thin walled steel tubes by Fatemi and Stephens. Conservative predictions within a factor of 4 for proportional loading and slightly over a factor of 4 for non- proportional loading are obtained. Thus, this methodology shows promise as a practical tool that could be used in durability predic- tions of components experiencing complex loading conditions 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0839.

Engineering development of a fully-integrated polypropylene instrument panel concept. Gerhard Slik, Vikas Gupta, and Dave Chapman, Dow Chemical Co. In the present paper the engineering development of a structural instrument panel (IP) concept made of a Polypropylene (PP) rubber modified compound filled with 15% talc in which the metal cross car beam has been eliminated, is discussed. The design concept con- sists of three main injection molded shells which are vibration welded to each other to form a stiff structure. The steering column is attached to the BIW and plastic structure by means of a separate column support made of steel, aluminum, magnesium or fiber- reinforced plastic. The concept has been developed for the European market and is therefore not intended to meet the unbelted FMVSS 208 requirements. The total IP assembly has a substantially lower cost and weight than conventional cross car beam based IP struc- tures while meeting all of the performance requirements. The concept development was supported by static and dynamic numerical analyses using well established, widely used FEA codes. The NVH behavior of the structural IP was studied and opti- mized with use of NASTRAN®. Thermal expansion was studied with ABAQUS®. The behavior during an off-set deformable barrier test, head impact, side impact test and passenger airbag deployment loading has been studied with use of LS-DYNA3D®. The optimized design showed that compared with a baseline IP structure using a cross car beam a weight saving of 2.5 kg can be achieved. 2001-01-0842. Conceptual development and engineering vali- dation of a hybrid instrument panel, integrating the HVAC sys- tem. Eugenio Toccalino and Dagmar van Heur, Dow Chemical Co. ; and Maurizio Pettigiani, Magneti Marelli Integra. The platform strategy broadly used by OEMs across their differ- ent brands, as well as the increasing targets in terms of cost, weight and performance are driving forward since several years the modu- lar approach for a new generation of instrument panels. An innova- tive hybrid concept has been developed in order to integrate the HVAC system with the structural IP components, reducing cost and weight, improving thermal comfort and structural performance, with at the meantime high style flexibility. The integration of metallic and thermoplastic components, together with a structural use of plastic parts, has driven to the devel- opment of different modular concepts. Each of these concepts has been screened and optimized using engineering tools such as finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in order to assess the structural, noise- vibration-harshness (NVH), air- flow and cool-down performance. The virtual stage mentioned before has been followed by an experimental validation on physical prototypes in order to prove the final concept. 2001-01-0843.

The hidden airbag door presents several challenges to the design and analysis Engi- neer. Airbag deployments function as a system of components, act- ing in concert. Design optimization requires investigating the indi- vidual parts and their interactions as a structure.

(SP- 1575) Pressure-sensitive adhesives. Mike Szymberski, General Motors Corporation Truck Group. Pressure sensitive adhesives are used on a large number of auto- motive applications. The application can be anywhere on the vehicle - interior, exterior, or under the hood. PSA's can be rubber, acrylic, or silicone based. Acrylic-based formulations are the most common, based on cost, durability, and weathering resistance. PSA tapes come in different forms - transfer tape, single coated, double coated, and double-coated foam. Double-coated foam tapes can fill gaps and some foam chemistries can relieve bond stress. PSA's are used to bond both similar and dissimilar materials, and can be formulated to bond to low surface energy plastics. 2001-01-0845. (SP- 1575) Flame retardants in automotive plastics. David L. Edenburn, Albemarle Corp. Currently, at least 10% by weight of a modern car is plastic, this would is over 100 Kg of plastic in an average mid-sized car and is increasing every year. Clearly, the use of plastics in automotive applications is important. These plastics are used for various techni- cal and economic reasons. In the countless engineering decisions made to design and build a car, plastics were chosen because they were the best material for the task. Also important are the changing laws and requirements. Tougher emission standards mean lower weight, tougher impact require- ments mean stronger and more ductile materials. Environmental restrictions limit the material choices of the designer. In addition are the Federal standards for flammability in the U. S. and similar stan- dards in other countries. This paper will discuss the various flammability regulations required for cars and the types of formulations typically used to meet these requirements for the various plastics used. Also dis- cussed will be the impact various types of flame retardants have on the plastic and where compromises have to be made. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0846. (SP-1575) An advanced high flow PCABS for improving injection molding processes and cycles. Blair S. Patty, Dow Automotive/The Dow Chemical Co.; and Cheryl Weckle, Hoang Pham, and Dick Lauer, Dow Chemical Co. An advanced high flow PCABS was developed for improving the efficiency of injection-molding processes and cycle times. Propri- etary technology was used to develop this new blend while main- taining key properties (heat resistance and impact) necessary to meet end use part requirements. Significant rheological improvements in melt flow rate (MFR) and flow capabilities throughout the entire viscosity versus shear rate range were obtained. These improve- ments allowed for lower cooling times (21-27% reduction) and injection pressures. Molders using this resin have the potential to improve cycle times, improve processes, and save money. This paper will document cycle time and process improvements in automotive instrument panel applications with the new high flow PCABS blend, PULSE*2000EZ. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0847.

Accelerated development of the 2000 Saturn three-door coupe rear quarter panel. David A. Dean, GE Plas- tics ; and Steven Griffin, General Motors Corp. 114</page><page sequence="114">2001-01-0840-2001-01-0857 In 1990 Saturn Corporation began production of a vehicle line, including sedan and coupe body styles, utilizing polymer body pan- els. This polymer body panel system offers benefits to the end-use customer, including: Dent/ding resistance; Corrosion resistance; and Weight savings enabling increased fuel economy and vehicle perfor- mance. Saturn Corporation also benefits from this polymer body panel system through significantly reduced up-front investment cost and shortened tooling lead times. The design, development, and manufacturing of polymer body panels for the new Three-Door Coupe will be discussed in this paper. Saturn drew upon experience gained over the past 8 years to fake full advantage of the shorter lead times inherent in utilizing injection mold tooling. The shorter tooling lead-time enabled a suc- cessful fast vehicle development and launch. The Three-Door Coupe is an industry first for Saturn. Being fast to market with a new vehicle is considered to be a significant com- petitive advantage that can help to enable market share growth. This paper will explain in more detail the specific program elements in the development of the Three-Door Coupe rear quarter panel. 2001-01-0849.

Hoffman , Beaumont Runner Technologies , Inc.; and John P. Beaumont , Penn State Erie - The Behrend College. This paper presents results of studies which have found that a severe shear and thermal imbalance exists between cavities molded in the industry's traditional "naturally balanced" runner designs. The imbalance has been found to be the major cause of variations in multi-cavity injection molds -limiting product consistency, lower statistical Cpk values and the number of cavities which can be used in molding high precision automotive parts. A new technology developed and patented at Penn State University, provides a simple solution which strategically positions the shear induced melt varia- tions so that a true balance can be achieved. The resultant balance allows for higher cavitation tooling, improved Cpk values, an increased process window and reduced clamp tonnage. This new technology also shows promise in influencing flow of gas in gas- assist injection molding and warpage of molded parts by controlling the position of the higher sheared hot melt in a mold cavity. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0851. (SP-1575) Optimizing rubber products for the automotive industry via characterization of compounds and computer modeling. Ben Chouchaoui , Windsor Industrial Devel- opment Laboratory , Inc. Trends in the automotive industry to develop better products, faster and at a lower cost create a need for simulation rather than testing prototypes. Modeling requires a laboratory to characterize rubber and high-end software to carry out nonlinear analysis typical to rubber applications (contact, large deformations and hyper-elastic material response). This paper describes some tests on rubber necessary to building quasi-static models. It also presents several analytical studies WIDL completed on behalf of molders of rubber components for the auto- motive industry.

Libor Strambersky, David Vozenilek , and Jaroslav Purma, Visteon Corp. This article deals with the analysis of the opto-mechanical con- cepts of HID headlamps, which serve for the change of the light dis- tribution to achieve both the low beam and high beam functions. This article describes the mechanical solutions for changing of these functions for parabolic systems, projector systems and projector- parabolic systems. Each of these systems uses the movements of the optical components such as the shield in projector and projector- parabolic systems and likewise the movement of the optical refrac- tor, HID source or the reflector itself in the parabolic system. The goal of this article is to analyze the solution from the optical and mechanical point of view and the analysis of the advantages of each system. 2001-01-0853.

A GDHL capable of producing both high and low beams from a single gas discharge bulb was developed. Two principles of beam switching were tried: (1) shield driving whereby the quantity of light incident on the reflector is varied by driving a light shield in the for- ward-rearward directions using a solenoid actuator, and (2) bulb driving whereby the bulb position relative to the reflector is varied by driving the bulb in the forward-rearward directions. In this paper, we report the shield driving type that we commercialized earlier this year. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0854.

(SP-1595) Development of discharge headlamp ballast by applying hybrid IC technology. Yasutoshi Horii, Denso Corp. The popularity of discharge headlamps is increasing due to their higher luminous output and lower power consumption as compared with halogen headlamps. Discharge headlamps require a control unit called a "ballast" which ignites the lamp through high voltage dis- charge and controls power for the lamp during normal operation. Because there is limited space around the headlamp area and the total headlamp mass must be kept to a minimum, size and mass reduction were the key considerations in our ballast development efforts. Applying our in-house hybrid IC (integrated circuit) technology, we have developed a new, smaller ballast. As a result, we have achieved a ballast size and weight that is half that of the current design. This paper summarizes our technology and approach to the development of this new ballast. 2001-01-0857. (SP-1595) A market- weighted description of low-beam headlighting patterns in Europe.

The sample included 20 low-beam headlamps manufactured for use on the 20 best-selling passenger vehicles for calendar year 1999 in 17 European countries. These 20 vehicles represent 47% of all vehicles sold in these coun- tries. The lamps were purchased directly from vehicle dealerships, and photometered in 0.25° steps from 45° left to 45° right, and from 5° down to 7° up. The photometric information for each lamp was weighted by 1999 sales figures for the corresponding vehicle.

(SP- 1595) Automotive lighting thermal perfor- mance prediction methods. Thomas Poorman, Joseph Bielecki , Mojun Chang , Sharad Be Is are, and Fadi El-Khatib, North Ameri- can Lighting. Thermal performance of automotive lighting must be considered early in the design phase of any lighting program. Several tech- niques are used to determine if a new design will pass thermal requirements. Many automotive lamps are design from experience, where historical information is used to qualify a design. Quantitative methods for determining lamp thermal performance allow optimiza- tion of parameters, which can affect lighting cost. This paper will present a comparison between experimental based modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches for determining the viability of an automotive lamp design. 2001-01-0859. (SP-1595) Temperature measurement errors in automotive lighting. Russell Bloomfield, GE Plastics. This paper examines a variety of thermocouple and infrared mea- surement techniques as means of obtaining accurate and consistent temperature measurements within a headlamp system. While mea- suring temperature is straightforward in principle, in practice, these measurements are fraught with potential error. The paper summa- rizes a succession of experiments conducted at our Parts Design Center (formerly the Application Development Resource Center) in Pittsfield, MA. These experiments lead to the ability to accurately measure temperature at a given location within a lamp assembly. Using these studies and the resulting transfer functions as a founda- tion, a Design of Experiment (D.O.E.) is presented which explores the effect of a variety of headlamp design factors on the surface tem- perature of a headlamp reflector at a given location. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0860. (SP-1595) Development of a CFD model for simulating headlamp humidity clearing. Touichirou Shiozawa, Masatoshi Yoneyama, Koichi Sakakibara, and Shuichi Goto , Koito Manufacturing Co., Ltd.; Norihisa Tsuda, Nippon Steel Corp.; Tet- suo Saga and Toshio Kobayashi, University of Tokyo ; and William I. Moore and Frances K. Hilburger, Guide Corp. In order to improve thermal endurance, mechanical durability and ventilation performance in a headlamp, it is important to under- stand heat transfer and flow in an automotive headlamp. Especially in a design stage, understanding natural convection inside the headlamp will make it possible to shorten its development period, which can be fulfilled by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In the present study, a newly-developed method called Surface Heat Transfer (SHT) method, that is a unique technique for making an accurate estimate of temperature and velocity in the automotive headlamp without involving the couple of the fluid mechanics and the structural mechanics (the coupled fluid solid interaction), was investigated for practical use. An evaluation of SHT method was performed, and CFD results were compared with the experimental results. Consequently, the temperature results by CFD were within ±10 degrees as compared with the experimental results. 2001-01-0861 The use of vented automotive lamps while reducing cost can also result in moisture intrusion through the vent openings into the lamp. If the lamp internal air humidity approaches 100% water vapor may condense on the lens inner surfaces which detracts from the lamp appearance and quality of the light output. Headlamps are required to pass a humidity clearing test which is specified by the FMVSS108 procedure. Prior to the use of CFD predictive tools, lamp venting design was basically a trial and error process which could sometimes require several different prototypes before passing the test. Now by using CFD the venting design can be optimized without the need for prototypes which results in reduced design cost and faster time to market. By utilizing a combined external/internal flow CFD model with coupled heat and mass transfer, lamp vents can be placed in regions that will maximize the removal rate of humidity from the lamp interior. A headlamp FMVSS108 CFD model has been developed and the predicted lamp internal humidity correlated to within +/- 10% of experimental humidity measure- ments. With further CFD code developments and increased comput- ing speed it will be possible to explicitly model the formation and removal of water vapor in automotive lamps, thus allowing the designer to optimize the vent location to minimize the risk of con- densation occurring. This virtual design method will reduce design cost and dependence on prototypes while improving lamp performance. 2001-01-0861.

John Van Derlofske, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 116</page><page sequence="116">2001-01-0863-2001-01-0869 This paper examines the consequences of fabrication effects on the performance of injection-molded plastic light pipes for distribu- tive automotive lighting. It discusses the magnitude of these effects on propagating and output light. Molding errors, such as sinks, voids, flow lines, knit lines, and warpage, will be examined through computer modeling and measurement of sample distributive lighting systems. Two example light pipe systems will be presented, an instrument cluster pointer system and a regional distributive interior lighting system. For the pointer system, computer modeling results, such as total light output and output exitance distributions will be presented. Modeling results will be presented for both an error free system and system that include the aforementioned molding errors. These results will be compared to determine the output light loss and redis- tribution. For the regional interior lighting system, total output and exitance measurements of fabricated light pipe systems will be pres- ented for comparison and to illustrate the effects of errors. Since it is impossible or impractical to eliminate all injection molding fabrication errors from manufactured light pipe systems, this paper will conclude with a discussion of the circumstances under which individual errors should be diminished or eliminated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0865.

Yuma Miyauchi, Koji Fujii , Takayuki Nishino, Koichi Hatamura, and Toru Kurisu , Mazda Motor Corp. Reduction of transmission error by gear tooth profile optimiza- tion and tuning of gear resonance modes are known as effective methods for gear noise reduction. This paper concentrates on struc- turing a process for reducing gear noise using the latter method. The procedure comprises a study of gear noise mechanism from trans- mission error to radiation noise, an application of Steyer's method in gear frequency analysis and implementation of an invented device called "noise reduction ring." This inexpensive and practical ring reduces gear noise drastically by lOdB, which is predicted by the simulation and verified by the experiment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0866.

Inc.; and Koichi Okada, and Makoto Yasui, NTN Corp. This paper describes a new two-way, over-running mechanical clutch and electronic control for four-wheel-drive systems. This package is called the "Lock On Demand" (LOD) system. The LOD system is composed of a two-way over-running roller clutch, an electronic controller, and sensors. The controller actuates the roller clutch mechanism, putting the vehicle in 2WD or 4WD based on the information from sensors which measure speed, throt- tle position, brake activity, etc. The two-way roller clutch is composed of a cammed inner race, a cylindrical outer race, rollers and retainer. An electro-magnetic coil is used as the activating trigger for the mechanical clutch. In this paper, the LOD system is introduced, and details are given for the operation of the roller clutch and controller. In addition, the results from a finite element analysis (FEA) are included. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0867. (SP- 1598) Automatic transmission hydraulic system cleanliness - The effects of operating conditions, mea- surement techniques and high-efficiency filters. Pierre Nieuw- land, NTZ Nederland BV.; and Timothy A. Droste, Ford Motor Co. Malfunction due to solid particle contamination can be separated into two types. Type I malfunctions involve large particles (&gt;150 micron), most often the remnants of manufacturing, and generally lead to early life repairs. Type II contamination includes much smal- ler particles (&lt;50 micron), most of which are either generated wear debris, or particles ground up from larger Type I debris. These Type II particles are responsible for erratic valve performance, poor cool- ing and lubrication, and the accelerated degradation of Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF), all of which promote transmission mid- life failures. This paper focuses on Type II contamination only. Hydraulic system cleanliness has a significant impact on shift timing, feel and general transmission durability. In order to manage the system cleanliness, a uniform repeatable measurement system must be available. Further, the effects of operating conditions must be known and considered. Once operating effects are accounted for, and reliable measurement techniques can be applied, improvements in system cleanliness may be developed and evaluated in a methodi- cal manner. Using ultra-high efficiency (Ex = 99.96%) bypass micro filters dramatically reduces the contamination level of solid particles in the ATF. Intensive road tests with and without the additional applica- tion of such filters are compared. On average, the ATF cleanliness level was measured to be 4-5 points lower on the ISO 4406 standard scale when using NTZ filters. This is equivalent to a reduction by a factor of 16-32 in the number of solid particles responsible for Type II malfunctions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0868. (SP- 1598) PIV measurement on the flow field around a stator cascade of automotive torque converter. Yasunori Kunisaki, EXEDY Corp.; Toshio Kobayashi, Tetsuo Saga, Nobuyuki Taniguchi, and Shigeki Segawa, University of Tokyo; and Kouji Kajitani, Takao Fukunaga, and Tomohiro Tasaka, EXEDY Corp. The automotive torque converter is one of the most important component parts in the automatic transmission. In recent years, the design demands have been for both high performance and compact size. For the optimized design to satisfy with these demands, it is necessary to analyze the internal flow field of torque converters. The internal flow field around the stator of an automotive torque converter is investigated experimentally in this study by using Parti- cle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. The objective of this inves- tigation is to understand the flow field around the stator which has the important role to characterize the torque converter performance. The three-dimensional flow field is reconstructed by using the two- dimensional PIV results at two orthogonal planes. The stream lines (starting points of the stream lines are 3 [mm] upstream from leading edge of the stator blade) shows that the flow field is uniform and smooth along the stator blades profile in all the passage near both shell and core sides at the high-speed ratio condi- tion. However, the small flow diffraction near the core side and the large flow diffraction near the shell side can be observed at the low speed ratio condition. These flow diffractions indicate the flow sep- aration and reversed flow occurrence which may affect the torque converter performance. The existences of the clockwise secondary flow circulation at the stator mid-chord suction side can be seen clearly from the time aver- aged velocity vectors at the low-speed ratio condition. No secondary flow can be found at the high-speed ratio condition. The clockwise secondary flow circulation at the stator mid-chord is considered to be caused by inlet flow condition which is hard to simulate in the most widely used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software (Standard k-e model). The three-dimensional data obtained by this study can be used to optimize the stator design for torque converter performance improvement. It can be used to validate the accuracy of CFD also. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0869.

The clutch disk is slightly modified by incorporating several short metallic posts on two separate parts of the disk. Damper springs on the clutch disk act as the primary sen- sor. Damper springs deform when a torque is applied on the clutch disk. The deformation is directly proportional to the applied torque. Hence, one can acquire the torque information by measuring the deformation of the damper springs. The pick-up sensor is a non- contact magnetic reluctance type sensor. The torque sensor was installed on a small vehicle with a 3-cylin- der engine, and test data were acquired on the street during a normal driving. The test results indicate that the sensor is accurate, very sen- sitive to the extent that the torque variation during the ignition inter- vals are observable. As a byproduct, the rpm of the clutch disk, hence the transmission input shaft is produced. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0870.

Clutches and brakes are important elements in automatic trans- missions in terms of function, number of parts and design works involved. Among the many design options and variables involved in the clutch and brake design, selection of return and cushion spring types and their characteristics are important for positive disengage- ment and better shift quality.

In this paper, the functions and design requirements of return and cushion springs are reviewed. In order to provide some design guide lines for engineers, sample designs of return and cushion springs have been made using round wire coil, flat wire wave coil, disk and wave springs. A comparison of the results in terms of space, weight, cost and transmission performance is also provided. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0871.

Thirteen modes of operation are possible, including one motor- only mode, three power modes, one CVT/charging mode, four engine-only modes, and four regenerative braking modes. Because the design is based on conventional automatic transmission compo- nents, the design is simple, compact, relatively efficient, and reliable. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0876.

To optimize a shift transient during clutch engagement (third phase of a gearshift) it is fundamental to define the engine velocity reference and the more appropriate instant at which to begin the clutch engagement itself. An analytical procedure to calculate the engine velocity reference value during the third phase of a gearshift and the moment when to begin the clutch engagement is presented. Simulation results obtained considering upshift and downshift with engine torque either applied or not are presented. The analytical solution presented permits to tune the third phase of the gearshift in an easier way than previous strategy based on look-up tables. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0878. (SP-1598) Ford's PRODIGY hybrid electric vehicle powertrain weight reduction actions. Anthony G. Gra- bowski, Source Technology LLC; and Arun K. Jaura, Ford Motor Co. In the 21st century automakers are continually being challenged to meet a myriad of new government regulations regarding Safety, Emissions, and Fuel Economy, but must balance key requirements such as Customer Satisfaction, Shareholder Value, and Profits. Cus- tomers desire high Fuel Economy (FE) in their vehicle selection, but they prefer it not to result in a loss to a vehicle's performance, room- iness, and safety. Current advances in hybrid vehicle technology can significantly diminish these conflicting requirements. However, these come at a significantly higher cost to the customer. One solu- tion to improving both vehicle performance and FE is weight reduc- tion by the use of advanced materials. Reducing the mass of the vehicle will result in a lower rolling resistance that will allow the vehicle manufacturer to size the engine smaller for a particular vehi- cle. This will improve FE, acceleration, and handling performance. Ford in the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) has built a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), PRODIGY that makes use of advances in materials and design. The PRODIGY powertrain makes extensive use of aluminum, magnesium, titanium and other lightweight materials applications to significantly reduce weight. This paper summarizes the material selection, steps taken to achieve powertrain weight reduction and design optimization used to reduce the weight of the PRODIGY powertrain. The paper discusses the effects of powertrain and vehicle weight reduction on FE. In addi- tion, the paper presents a brief overview of vehicle weight reduction actions. 2001-01-0879. (SP-1598) The universal control and protec- tion hydraulic automation for hydromechanical transmissions. L. Krasnevski and M. Vysotski, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus; and V. Boikov, Belarusian State Polytechnic Academy. Modern hydromechanical transmissions are equipped with elec- tronic-hydraulic (mechatronic) control systems having much more functional capabilities compared to classic hydraulic systems. However, automatic hydraulic systems are widely used not only as the basic transmissions' control device and a mechanical part of mechatronic systems but also as an important facility providing reli- ability and safety of such systems. At the same time such an application has quite a number of restrictions, especially for transmissions with a great number of gearstages. One of the main reasons is the inability to control more than 3 or 4 stages of gears while using the vehicle's speed as a con- trol parameter. It deals with the parabolic characteristic of the output pressure of centrifugal governor used as the vehicle speed sensor. This restriction can be eliminated by using a hydraulic detector of torque converter's turbine (i.e., input shaft of gearbox) speed. The paper considers the operating principles, design and testing of such a hydraulic automaton capable of controlling converters' lock-up clutch. It may be used in hydromechanical transmissions as the sys- tem's back up and protection or as a self-sufficient hydraulic automaton. 2001-01-0880.

In the design of noncircular chain drive, the key problem is to design pitch line of noncircular chain wheel.

(SP-1598) The automated shift transmission (AST) - Possibilities and limits in production-type vehicles. Mathias Link , Burghard Voß, Erik Eggert, and Roland Nasdal, IAV GmbH. State-of-the-art powertrain concepts with automatic transmission must comply with increasingly stringent legislation on emissions and fuel consumption while fulfilling or surpassing customers' expectations as to driveability. In this respect, automated manual transmissions (AMT) and automated shift transmissions (AST) must compete with conventional automatic transmissions (AT) and con- tinuously variable transmissions (CVT). In order to exploit the theoretical advantages of ASTs and put them into practice, complex ECU functions are needed to coordinate engine and transmission. Adaptive control, sophisticated clutch management and an intelligent shifting strategy allow shifting qual- ity and shifting points to be simultaneously optimized to the effect that performance and comfort are increased while fuel consumption is reduced. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0882. (SP-1598) Application of transmission systems for different driveline configurations in passenger cars. Gerhard Wagner, ZF Getriebe GmbH. The most common driveline configurations in cars are the stan- dard drive with front longitudinal engine and rear-wheel drive and the front-transverse drive with east- west installed powertrain as well as all-wheel-drive variants derived from these. These driveline con- figurations are used in different vehicle segments. The transmission systems mainly used today are automatic transmissions with 4 or 5 speeds and manual transmissions with 4, 5 or 6 speeds. A small number of automated manual transmissions (AMT) and continu- ously variable transmissions (CVT) are in production. Various sys- tems of automated manual transmissions, powershift transmissions designed as double clutch transmissions and toroidal transmissions are currently being developed. A brief explanation will be given about the structure of all differ- ent driveline configurations and the transmission systems will then be considered for specific applications in these different drivelines. The installation situation with transmission structure and space, potential for fuel savings with overall ratio and efficiency, reduction of emissions and noise levels, performance, drive comfort, transmis- sion weight and manufacturing costs are considered as the main aspects within this paper. This leads to an assessment and recom- mendation for the use of certain transmission systems for the various driveline configurations. In the future, both 6-speed automatic transmissions and 6-speed manual transmissions will be used on a wider scale with standard drives. The use of continuously variable transmissions will increase for front transverse drive. In the field of manual transmissions the 5 -speeds will dominate in front transverse drive applications. The degree of automation will increase in this segment. For torque levels of up to approximately 1 80 Nm, preference will be given to the use of automated manual transmissions. The range of up to 350 Nm will be predominantly covered by CVT's, five and six-speed automatic transmissions will subsist in the segment above 350 Nm for trans- verse installation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 119</page><page sequence="119">2001-01-0883-2001-01-0890 2001-01-0883. (SP- 1598) An adjustable aluminum differen- tial. Badih A . Jawad, Daniella C. Marcuzzi , and William P. Can- ning , Lawrence Technological Univ. The 2000 Formula SAE Team at Lawrence Technological Uni- versity (LTU) has designed a chain-driven, three-piece aluminum differential unique from past years. This innovative design intro- duces an adjustable chain mount replacing conventional shackles. Made completely of aluminum, this device moves the entire rear dri- vetrain. The gear set remains to be limited slip with a student designed housing. The idea of an aluminum housing with manufactured gear set is a continued project at LTU. After cutting approximately 33% from the weight of the 1999 differential, the 2000 is geared toward a simpler, and smaller design, easier assembly and lighter weight. After reading this brief overview, the idea of this paper is to provide an understanding of the reasoning behind the choices made on the LTU driveline team. 2001-01-0884. (SP- 1598) Analysis of fluctuations in bearing preload and optimal design of tapered roller bearings for pinion shaft support in differential gearboxes. Yoshitaka Hayashi, Makoto Zenbutsu, and Hiroshi Suzuki , NSK Ltd. Regarding tapered roller bearings used on pinion shafts in differ- ential gearboxes, it has been observed that some cases of bearing failure, like flaking or seizure, occurred much earlier than expected. As to the cause of this kind of failure, it has been clarified that on the shaft system supported by a pair of tapered roller bearings, the actual bearing load, including the preload of the bearings, fluctuates not only under the dynamic state but also under the static state because of the temperature distribution around the bearings. This fluctuation of the actual bearing load and preload greatly affects rolling fatigue life, seizure performance and the stiffness of the shaft support system. This paper discusses optimal design concepts for improving the rolling fatigue life, frictional torque, rigidity and sei- zure performance of a pair of tapered roller bearings. The design concepts are based on analysis results of the dynamic preload situa- tion under actual operating conditions. Also introduced is a down- sized shaft support system devised with a pair of tapered roller bear- ings developed using these design concepts. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0885. Approach to the Army transformation utiliz- ing future combat systems. Clifton J. Boyd , David J. Busse , and Paul A. Decker , U.S. Army Tank-automotive &amp; Armaments Research , Development &amp; Engineer. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the cause, philosophy, timeline, goals, tools, and challenges the U.S. Army is addressing with regards to meeting the Army Transforma- tion utilizing the Future Combat Systems (FCS). The U.S. Army has been faced with many challenges in the past, and has recently been given a mandate by the Chief of Staff of the Army to develop a lighter, more déployable and survivable combat system to meet the needs/challenges of the Army's Objective Force. The Objective Force is the product of the Army's Transformation Process. How- ever, unlike past programs, the Army has taken a vastly different approach to meet this challenge. The Army is starting with a "clean sheet of paper" and intends to influence the design of the Future Combat Systems by harnessing the collective technology advance- ments in both the military and commercial worlds. By moving away from the traditional way of doing business, the U.S. Army will make a giant step with the Future Combat Systems in making the Army Transformation successful. 2001-01-0887. TARDEC's robotic technology integration strategy. Jeffrey J. Jaczkowski , U. S. Army Tank-automotive &amp; Armaments Command. This paper will discuss the U. S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Research, Development and Engineering Center's (TARDEC's) four (4) axis strategy for integration of robotics into the legacy, interim and objective forces. At the cornerstone of this strategy is the R&amp;D effort concentrating on autonomous perception and navi- gation, intelligent tactical behavior, command and control, and man- robot interface entailed in the Demo III and Robotic Follower pro- grams. Smart Manned Systems will focus on a systems engineering approach for robotic solutions into the interim force (Vetronics Technology Testbed and Crew integration &amp; Automation Testbed). In the near-term, application of robotics to the legacy force will be achieved through adapting commercial automation technologies, which address military requirements. Finally, Intelligent Mobility will investigate improving intrinsic platform mobility to lessen the burden on robotic sensing performance. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to advance the robotics technology state of the art to achieve off-road full autonomous operations for military systems in support of the objective force. 2001-01-0888. Innovative design and ballistic performance of lightweight composite integral armor. Bazie A. Gama and John W. Gillespie , Jr., University of Delaware Center for Composite Materials (UD-CCM); and Travis A. Bogetti and Bruce K. Fink , US Army Research Lab , Aberdeen Proving Ground. Recent developments in design of composite armor for light- weight ground vehicle applications is discussed. Composite integral armor (CIA) is a multi-functional hybrid material system that has been successfully demonstrated in the Composite Armored Vehicle. A typical CIA hull consists of a composite cover layer, a ceramic strike face and a thick-section composite backing plate. CIA pro- vides equivalent ballistic performance at reduced areal-density than monolithic armor. Future combat vehicles will require modular armor upgrades of the CIA hull to increase ballistic protection for specific missions. Finite element (FE) modeling has been performed to understand the through thickness wave propagation and the effect of non-linear material behavior in CIA. Innovative design, fabrica- tion and ballistic performance evaluation of a new generation armor utilizing metal foams have been presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-0889. Future heavy tactical truck. Mark Feury, Nance Halle , George Simon, and Margaret Stinson, U.S. Army Tank- Automotive and Armaments Command. The Future Heavy Tactical Truck (FHTT) project is a prelimi- nary look at the capabilities of a heavy class tactical vehicle designed from the ground up which integrates both commercial and military combat technologies. The program objective was to provide concept designs and analysis to assess the performance capabilities of a new truck and to establish a technology base program to support future truck innovations. Two vehicle concept designs were devel- oped. Concept One is a "high tech" version, which would incorpo- rate the most advanced technologies and designs available and the second version, Concept Two, is a scaled back version based on per- formance and cost tradeoffs. Based on the results of these efforts, the Army has established an applied research program creating a partnership of Advanced Concepts and National Automotive Center engineers and scientists to conceive the Army's plan for its heavy, medium and light class trucks of the future. 2001-01-0890.

(SP-1572) Coefficients of restitution for low and moderate speed impacts with non-standard impact configu- rations. C. Brian Tanner , John F. Wiechel, Ron A. Bixel, and Philip H. Cheng, S.E.A., Inc.; Dennis A. Guenther, Ohio State Univ.; and Michael P. Cassidy, Daimler Chrysler Corp. There have been a number of papers written about the dynamic effects of low speed front to rear impacts between motor vehicles during the last several years. This has been an important issue in the field of accident analysis and reconstruction because of the fre- quency with which the accidents occur and the costs of injuries allegedly associated with them. Several of these papers have dis- cussed the importance of the coefficient of restitution in the acceler- ations and speed changes that the vehicles undergo in such impacts. These discussions often include data showing the measured restitu- tion for impacts involving various bumper types and closing speeds. However, in most of these studies, the impacts are controlled so that direct bumper to bumper impacts occur. This paper will present the results of several rear impact tests with non-standard impact configurations. These configurations include several passenger car bumper to light truck and SUV trailer hitch impacts, and partial underride impacts to vehicles with rear mounted spare tires. The results of these tests will be compared with the findings from several tests with more standard impact configura- tions, and the coefficients of restitution for each of the impact sce- narios will be discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0892. (SP-1572) Dependence of a coefficient of resti- tution on geometry for high speed vehicle collisions. Joel W. Can- non, Washington and Jefferson College. I investigate how a coefficient of restitution (CR) (the pre-to post-collision ratio of relative center of mass speeds) varies with collision geometry (vehicle orientation at contact and impulse direc- tion). Based on the low CRs measured for in-line collisions and bar- rier crash tests, I argue that in other collisions the CR will be close to the minimum value consistent with the collision's geometry, and that this fact can be useful in reconstructing accidents. I derive a general equation for calculating the CR' s lower bound, and investigate, for the particular case of a rear-impact collision, its variation with impulse direction (PDOF) relative to incident relative velocity (0j), offset, and the orientation of the collision contact sur- face. The minimum CR calculated here does not depend on the com- mon-velocity assumption, it therefore offers promise for analyzing side-swipe collisions. The minimum CR depends most strongly on 0j, increasing with increasing 0j. For many collisions the minimum CR can be approxi- mately calculated from a knowledge of 0j alone. For [0j] &gt;10°, the minimum CR is approximately equal to the lower bound (valid for all collisions) e &gt; sin ([0j]). The CR manifests a weaker dependence on vehicle offset and the direction of the inter-vehicle impulse, increasing with increasing offset, and increasing as the inter- vehicle impulse departs from the direction normal to the contact surface. I demonstrate how this CR can be used to reconstruct a vehicle collision where lack of data prevents reconstruction by conservation of momentum. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0893. (SP-1572) Low-speed impact testing of pickup truck bumpers. Bradley E. Heinrichs, Jonathan M. Lawrence, Boyd D. Allin, James J. Bowler, Craig C. Wilkinson, Kurt W. Ising, David J. King, and Stephen J. Ptucha, Maclnnis Engineering Asso- ciates. The purpose of this paper was to compare the damage to pickup truck bumpers produced by vehicle-to-barrier and vehicle-to- vehicle collisions of a similar severity, in order to determine whether vehi- cle-to-barrier tests can serve as surrogates for vehicle-to-vehicle tests in accident reconstruction. Impact tests were conducted on the front and rear bumpers of five pickup trucks. Each truck was sub- jected to an impact with a fixed barrier and with a passenger vehicle. All impacts resulted in pickup truck speed changes of about 8 km/h. Damage produced in the barrier and vehicle-to-vehicle collisions was similar if both collisions resulted in bumper mount damage on the pickup truck. If there was no bumper mount damage, then the bumper beam deformation depended on the shape of the impactor. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0896.

Stein, Safety Research Associates, Inc.; and William C. Whiting, California State University, Northridge. Analysis and reconstruction of pedestrian accidents remains a difficult task for the accident analyst. Time-distance analyses rely on currently published pedestrian walking speed data. There is a lack of real- world data in the current literature that evaluates pedes- trian perception/reaction to a signal change and acceleration to a steady-state walking velocity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the behavior and gait response of pedestrians at signal-controlled intersections. Real- world observations were made at eight intersections throughout the greater Los Angeles area with a concentration on adults and elderly adults. Of particular interest was the elapsed time between the illu- mination of a pedestrian walk sign and gait initiation. The rate of acceleration, steady state velocity and the number of steps required to reach a steady state velocity were also measured. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0897.

This paper provides a reference for "real-world" walking speeds of young pedestrians. The subjects of the study were unaware ele- mentary school children crossing at marked crosswalks adjacent to elementary schools. The unaware pedestrians were videotaped at 30 frames/second with a camera hidden in a parked vehicle that was not visible from the crosswalks. The pedestrians' constant walking speeds were ascertained from analysis of the video recording. The walking speed data was categorized according to gender, estimated age, number of pedestrians in a group and time of day. The observed trends were compared to data from existing studies. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0898. (SP-1572) Throw model for frontal pedestrian collisions. Inhwan Han, Hong Ik Univ.; and Raymond M. Brach, University of Notre Dame. A planar model for the mechanics of a vehicle-pedestrian colli- sion is presented, analyzed and compared to experimental data. It takes into account the significant physical parameters of wrap and forward projection collisions and is suitable for solution using math- ematics software or spreadsheets. Parameters related to the pedes- trian and taken into account include horizontal distance traveled between primary and secondary impacts with the vehicle, launch angle, center-of-gravity height at launch, the relative forward speed of the pedestrian to the car at launch, distance from launch to a ground impact, distance from ground impact to rest and pedestrian- ground drag factor. Vehicle and roadway parameters include pos- timpact, constant- velocity vehicle travel distance, continued vehicle travel distance to rest with uniform deceleration and relative dis- tance between rest positions of vehicle and pedestrian. The model is presented in two forms. The first relates the throw distance, sp, to the initial vehicle speed, vco, that is, sp = f(vco). The second, intended for reconstruction, relates the vehicle speed, vco, to the pedestrian throw distance, sp, that is, vco = f(sp). The first form is used extensively in the paper as means of comparison of the model to over 14 selected sets of experimental data taken from the 121</page><page sequence="121">200 1 -0 1 -0898-200 1 -0 1 -0904 current literature.

(SP- 1572) Human occupant motion in rear- end impacts: Effects of incremental increases in velocity change. Judson B. Welcher , Thomas J. Szabo , and Daniel P. Voss, Biome- chanical Research &amp; Testing, LLC . Interest in the mitigation of whiplash associated disorders (WAD) has increased in priority over the last 10 years, and an increasing number of human subject rear-end collision tests have been conducted to assist in the understanding of WAD. Tradition- ally this testing has examined the effects of variations in occupant characteristics (age, height, gender, etc.), seat characteristics (geo- metrical and constitutive), and impact severity. This data has resulted in advancements in the understanding of WAD and has pro- vided occupant performance corridors at specific velocity changes, however no controlled study has examined the singular effect of incremental velocity change increases on occupant kinematics. Moreover, while vehicle velocity change is typically employed as a singular measure of impact severity, it is of interest to examine whether this or other impact-related parameters, such as energy or acceleration, are also correlated with occupant kinematics. A series of five instrumented human subject rear-end impact tests were conducted to monitor the effects of increasing impact severity on occupant motions and forces. A female subject who approxi- mated the stature of a 50th percentile ("average") female partici- pated in the study. Impact speeds were selected such that the station- ary target vehicle experienced velocity changes of 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, 6.4 and 8 km/h (1 to 5 mph). A minivan was the target vehicle and the minivan's original unmodified driver's seat and seat belt were used for all tests. Accelerometers were affixed to both the target vehicle and human subject. The subject's motions during impact were recorded by an onboard high-speed digital video camera. Target vehicle Delta V, average vehicle acceleration, peak vehi- cle acceleration, and vehicle kinetic energy change were evaluated for their influence on various occupant response parameters. Occu- pant parameters which have been suggested to be associated with WAD causation in prior literature were selected. All of the vehicle parameters correlated well with relevant maximal head and torso accelerations; head, torso and knee rearward (-X) displacements; head and torso upward (+Z) displacements; and neck injury criteria (NIC) (p&lt;0.05). Average vehicle acceleration, peak vehicle acceler- ation, and vehicle kinetic energy proved only slightly better predic- tors for maximum head and torso accelerations than Delta V. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0900. (SP- 1572) Vehicle and occupant response in heavy truck to passenger car sideswipe impacts. C. Brian Tanner and John F. Wiechel, S. E. A., Inc.; and Dennis A. Guenther, Ohio State Univ. There have been a number of papers written about the dynamic effects of low-speed front-to-rear impacts between motor vehicles during the last several years. This has been an important issue in the field of accident analysis and reconstruction because of the fre- quency with which the accidents occur and the costs of injuries allegedly associated with them. Sideswipe impacts are another, often minor, type of motor vehicle impact that generate a significant number of injury claims. These impacts are difficult to analyze for a number of reasons. First, there have been very few studies in the literature describing the specific dynamic effects of minor sideswipe impacts on the struck vehicles and their occupants. Those that have been performed have focused on the impact of two passenger cars. Second, typical accident reconstruction programs are not well suited to accurately determine the vehicle speed changes and accelerations resulting from impacts where the line of the impact force lies far from the vehicle center of gravity, and is influenced by specific fea- tures of vehicle geometry. This paper will present the results of two controlled low speed sideswipe impact tests between a crane truck and a passenger car. The tests were performed to duplicate a real-world accident that resulted in litigation. The acceleration near the car's center of grav- ity is measured, as is the acceleration of the head of an adult male human volunteer. In addition, the relationship between vehicle dam- age and speed change is addressed for the subject impacts, and the occupant kinematics are described. Finally, the effect of full and partial vehicle braking by the passenger car in the impacts is dis- cussed. The data presented will give some reference for comparison in other heavy-truck-to-car sideswipe accidents. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0902. (SP-1582) Combining fuel-borne catalyst, cat- alytic wash coat and diesel particulate filter. P. Richards, B. Terry, and M. W. Vincent, Associated Octel Company Limited ,Ę and J. Chadderton, Engine Control Systems. In view of increasing concern over diesel particulates and tight- ening legislation to control their emission, much work has been done to develop diesel particulate filters (DPFs) and systems to allow them to work reliably. Although a filter will effectively trap solid particles, any material in the vapor phase, such as unburned hydrocarbons, may pass through the filter and subsequently con- dense. The use of a catalytic wash coat, either on the DPF itself or on a separate substrate, has been proposed to oxidize these hydrocar- bons and thus reduce the total material emitted. The use of fuel borne catalysts to aid the regeneration of trapped material within the DPF is also well documented. Such catalyst will also catalyze the oxidation of any hydrocarbons bound up within the particulate. The oxidation of such hydrocarbon occurs at a lower temperature than that of carbon itself, thus allowing lower tempera- ture regeneration of the DPF. The question thus arises; can low tem- perature regenerations and high filtration efficiencies for particulate mass be achieved by combining the use of a fuel borne catalyst and a catalytic wash coat with the diesel particulate filter. This paper describes work conducted on a test bench, using fuel treated with a fuel-borne catalyst, to assess the emissions and regen- eration performance of a DPF preceded or followed by an oxidation catalyst and the regeneration performance of a catalytically coated DPF. The results of fitting a car with a catalytically coated DPF and running on treated fuel are also reported. 2001-01-0903. (SP-1582) Microwave-regenerated diesel exhaust particulate filter. Richard D. Nixdorf, Industrial Ceramic Solutions, LLC ; and Johney B. Green, Jr., John M. Story, and Rob- ert M. Wagner, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Development of a microwave-regenerated particulate filter sys- tem has evolved from bench scale work to actual diesel engine experimentation. The filter system was initially evaluated on a sta- tionary mounted 1.2-L diesel engine and was able to remove a sig- nificant amount of carbon particles from the exhaust. The ability of the microwave energy to regenerate or clean the filter was also dem- onstrated on this engine under idle conditions. Based on the 1.2-L experiments, improvements to the filter design and materials were implemented and the system was re-evaluated on a vehicle equipped with a 7.3-L diesel engine. The 7.3-L engine was selected to achieve heavy filter loading in a relatively short period of time. The purpose of these experiments was to evaluate filter-loading capacity, power requirements for regeneration, and filter regeneration efficiency. A more detailed evaluation of the filter was performed on a stationary mounted 1 .9-L diesel engine. The effect of exhaust flow rate, load- ing, transients, and regeneration on filter efficiency was evaluated with this setup. In addition, gaseous exhaust emissions were investi- gated with and without an oxidation catalyst on the filter cartridge during loading and regeneration. 2001-01-0904.

Results of engine bench tests on a 1998 heavy-duty diesel engine have confirmed the emissions reduction performance of a U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered platinum/cerium bimetallic fuel-borne catalyst (FBC) used with several different cat- alyzed and uncatalyzed diesel particulate filters (DPF's). Perfor- mance was evaluated on both a 450ppm sulfur fuel (No.2 D) and a CARB 50ppm low-sulfur diesel (LSD) fuel. Particulate emissions of less than 0.02g/bhp-hr were achieved on several combinations of FBC and uncatalyzed filters on 450ppm sulfur fuel while levels of 0.01g/bhp-hr were achieved for both catalyzed and uncatalyzed fil- ters using the FBC with the low sulfur CARB fuel. Eight-mode steady state testing of one filter and FBC combina- tion with engine timing changes produced a 20% nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction with particulates (PM) maintained at 0.01g/bhp-hr and no increase in measured fuel consumption. In another evalua- tion, a bio-diesel blend of CARB low sulfur fuel and the FBC com- bined with a catalyzed DPF and engine-timing changes produced PM levels of 0.01g/bhp-hr with NOx emissions of 3.4g/bhp-hr over the FTP test cycle. A blend of a commercial jet/kerosene fuel and the FBC demonstrated PM and NOx reductions of 33% and 10% below results obtained for the No. 2 base fuel. Future tests are planned to evaluate this cleaner burning diesel blend with filters, and engine timing changes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0905.

Moulijn , Delft University of Technology. The physical state of a heterogeneous soot oxidation catalyst has a big impact on their performance. Contact between soot and solid catalysts is one of the key parameters for soot oxidation. Catalyst formulations based on low eutectic melting points were studied. Formulation based on cesiumsulfate and vanadiumoxide, became active at their melting point of 320-350°C. Ceramic foam can act as support for the liquid catalyst as well as a deep filter for the soot. Downstream of a small diesel engine a balance temperature of 350°C was established with an initial trapping efficiency of 40 %. Stable pressure drop over the system was maintained over a period of more than 24 hours. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0906.

The US application was done with a medium-heavy duty engine and the European application with a light duty engine. The efficiency of the DPF was determined by measuring both soot and inorganic product emissions. After the trials, the DPF were disman- tled and retained ashes were characterized and their localization in the filter analyzed. 2001-01-0907. (SP-1582) Regeneration of catalytic diesel par- ticulate filters. J. Gieshoff, M. Pfeifer, A. Schaf er-Sindlinger, U. Hackbarth, and O. Teysset, dmc2 AG; C. Colignon, C. Rigaudeau, and O. Salvai, PSA Peugeot Citroën; and H. Krieg, and B. W. Wen- clawiak, University of Siegen. This paper will discuss a number of different matters relating to the regeneration of catalyst-coated diesel particulate filters such as: impact of the catalyst on the soot ignition temperature, soot combus- tion rate and NO2 generation. If catalytic coatings prove to be sufficient compared to certain fuel additives they could be used in second generation diesel partic- ulate aftertreatment systems. Examples will be shown on how cata- lytic diesel particulate filters ("DPF") can operate on a common rail passenger car diesel engine. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the future combination of particulate - and NOx - emission control for diesel passenger cars. 2001-01-0908. (SP-1582) Spatial non-uniformities in diesel particulate trap regeneration. Athanasios G. Konstandopoulos, Michigan Technological Univ.; and Margaritis Kostoglou and Paraskevi Housiada, Aerosol &amp; Particle Technology Lab. Diesel particulate trap regeneration is a complex process involv- ing the interaction of phenomena at several scales. A hierarchy of models for the relevant physicochemical processes at the different scales of the problem (porous wall, filter channel, entire trap) is employed to obtain a rigorous description of the process in a multi- dimensional context. The final model structure is validated against experiments, resulting in a powerful tool for the computer-aided study of the regeneration behavior. In the present work we employ this tool to address the effect of various spatial non-uniformities on the regeneration characteristics of diesel particulate traps. Non- uniformities may include radial variations of flow, temperature and particulate concentration at the filter inlet, as well as variations of particulate loading. In addition, we study the influence of the distri- bution of catalytic activity along the filter wall. Despite the com- plexity of the process and the many factors that influence it, the computational tools developed make it feasible to undertake a sys- tematic optimization of these factors for the development of the next generation of diesel particulate trap systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0909. (SP-1582) Inertial contributions to the pres- sure drop of diesel particulate filters. Athanasios G. Konstan- dopoulos, Michigan Technological Univ.; Evangelos Skaperdas, Aerosol &amp; Particle Technology Lab.; and Mansour Masoudi, Cor- ning Incorporated. Wall-flow diesel particulate filters operating at low filtration velocities usually exhibit a linear dependence between the filter pressure drop and the flow rate, conveniently described by a gener- alized Darcy 's law. It is advantageous to minimize filter pressure drop by sizing filters to operate within this linear range. However in practice, since there often exist serious constraints on the avail- able vehicle underfloor space, a vehicle manufacturer is forced to choose an "undersized" filter resulting in high filtration velocities through the filter walls. Since secondary inertial contributions to the pressure drop become significant, Darcy 's law can no longer accu- rately describe the filter pressure drop. In this paper, a systematic investigation of these secondary inertial flow effects is presented. The investigation has lead to an analytical approximation shown to be in remarkable agreement with both experimental data collected in the laboratory with a variety of filters and with detailed 3-D Com- putational Fluid Dynamics calculations. The inclusion of these addi- tional inertial losses to available filter pressure drop models enables more accurate predictions of pressure drop of diesel particulate fil- ters under all practical ranges of exhaust flow. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0910. (SP-1582) A study of the effect of a catalyzed particulate filter on the emissions from a heavy-duty diesel engine with EGR. Arvind Suresh, John H. Johnson, Susan T. Bag- ley, and David G. Leddy, Michigan Technological Univ. The effects of catalyzed particulate filter (CPF) and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) on heavy-duty diesel engine emissions were studied in this research. EGR is used to reduce the NOx emissions but at the same time it can increase total particulate matter (TPM) emissions. CPF is technology available for retrofitting existing vehi- cles in the field to reduce the TPM emissions. A conventional low sulfur fuel (371 ppm S) was used in all the engine runs. Steady-state loading and regeneration experiments were performed with CPF 1 123</page><page sequence="123">2001-01-0910-2001-01-0916 to determine its performance with respect to pressure drop and par- ticulate mass characteristics at different engine operating conditions. From the dilution tunnel emission characterization results for CPF II, at Mode 1 1 condition (25% load - 31 1 Nm, 1800 rpm), the TPM, HC and vapor phase emissions (XOC) were decreased by 70%, 62% and 62%, respectively, downstream of the CPF II. From the analysis of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fluoranthene emis- sions associated with the particle associated PAH's and the XOC associated PAH's were reduced by 60% and 38% downstream of CPF II, respectively, at Mode 1 1 condition. Pyrene emissions asso- ciated with the SOF associated PAHs and XOC associated PAHs were reduced downstream of CPF II by 84% and 63%, respectively, at Mode 11 condition. 1-nitropyrene emissions were reduced by 30% downstream of CPF II. The mutagenic activity associated with the TPM decreased downstream of CPF II at Mode 1 1 condition. At Mode 9 condition (75% load - 932 Nm, 1800 rpm), the TPM, HC and XOC emissions were reduced by 30%, 55% and 69%, respec- tively, downstream of CPF II. The raw exhaust measurements showed 81% filtering efficiency of solids with CPF II. A 140% increase in nuclei mode particle number concentration was found downstream of CPF II compared to the baseline at Mode 9 condi- tion. The particle associated fluoranthene and pyrene emissions were reduced by 97% and 68% downstream of CPF II, respectively, at Mode 9 condition. An increase in 1-nitropyrene emissions by 213% was found downstream of CPF II at Mode 9 condition. The SOF associated mutagenic activity could not be compared at Mode 9 condition since samples downstream of CPF II were not tested due to very low masses. The XOC samples for Mode 9 displayed very little mutagenic activity for both the baseline and downstream of CPF II. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0911. (SP-1582) Validation of a model and develop- ment of a simulator for predicting the pressure drop of diesel particulate filters. Mansour Masoudi, Corning Incorporated; and Athanasios G. Konstandopoulos, Michail S. Nikitidis , Evangelos Skaperdas , Dimitrios Zarvalis, Evdoxia Kladopoulou , and Christo- doulos Altiparmakis, Michigan Technological Univ. As demand for wall-flow Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) increases, accurate predictions of DPF behavior, and in particular their pressure drop, under a wide range of operating conditions bears significant engineering applications. In this work, validation of a model and development of a simulator for predicting the pressure drop of clean and particulate-loaded DPFs are presented. The model, based on a previously developed theory, has been validated exten- sively in this work. The validation range includes utilizing a large matrix of wall-flow filters varying in their size, cell density and wall thickness, each positioned downstream of light- or heavy-duty die- sel engines; it also covers a wide range of engine operating condi- tions such as engine load, flow rate, flow temperature and filter soot loading conditions. The validated model was then incorporated into a DPF pressure drop simulator. A unique feature of this simulator is the inclusion of a database of diesel particulate packing densities and particulate layer permeabilities and their systematic dependence on filter operating conditions. Reliably predicting filter pressure drop under all practical conditions, this simulator has proven to be a valuable tool for realistic engineering applications of Diesel partic- ulate filters. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0912. (SP-1582) Numerical study on forced regener- ation of wall-flow diesel particulate filters. Y. Miyairi, S. Miwa, F. Abe , Z. Xu, and Y. Nakasuji, NGK Insulators, Ltd. A computational model which describes the combustion and heat transfer that takes place during forced regeneration of honeycomb structured wall flow type diesel particulate filter was developed. In this model, heat released by the soot-oxygen reaction, convection heat transfer in the gas phase, conductive heat transfer in solid walls, and heat transfer between the gas and wall of each honeycomb cell at various radial positions in a filter are calculated. Each honeycomb cell was modeled as one solid phase and two gas phases and these three phases were divided in the axial direction into small elements. Conductive heat transfer between the small solid elements and con- vection heat transfer between the small gas elements were calculated for each small time increment. Conductive radial heat transfer between honeycomb cells was also calculated. By comparison between calculated results with this model and experimental results under available limited conditions, the accuracy of the calculation model was verified. Filter temperature distributions were calculated for a wide range of material thermal properties, various cell struc- tures and various filter shapes. Using the calculated temperature dis- tributions, thermal stress analyses were performed for various filter designs and materials to discuss the relative merits of materials and structures. As conclusions, effects of material properties and struc- tural design on filter durability in respect to thermal stress during forced regeneration are presented and favorable material selection and an example of stress relief design are proposed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0913. A study of crevice flow in a gas engine using laser-induced fluorescence. Masayuki Tamura, Teruhiro Sakurai, and Hideo Tai, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. We visualized behavior of crevice flows in a spark ignition gas engine by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of acetone and OH. The fuel used in this work was methane with 10 vol. % acetone vapor. Acetone acts as a LIF tracer for unburned fuel, and OH radical which exists naturally in hydrocarbon flames is used as a marker species of high temperature zones. This technique enables simulta- neous tomographic observations of high temperature zones and unburned zones in engine cylinders, and the technique gives abun- dant information on oxidation process of fuel. A transparent engine whose cylinder wall was made of fused silica for observations and laser access was used for experiments. A crevice flow released from a crevice between a piston and a cylinder wall was visualized. In this work, we investigated effects of valve timing, back-pressure, and ignition timing. We found that behavior of the crevice flow changes suddenly at moment of exhaust valve opening. And we clarified that an exhaust blow-down affects the oxidation of the crevice flow. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0915. Laser-Rayleigh imaging of DME sprays in an optically accessible DI diesel truck engine. Öivind Andersson, Robert Collin, Rolf Egnell, and Marcus Aldén, Lund Institute of Technology. Laser-Rayleigh imaging has been employed to measure the rela- tive fuel concentration in DME sprays. The measurements were per- formed in an optically accessible diesel truck engine equipped with a common rail injection system. A one-hole nozzle was used to guarantee that the recorded pressure history was associated with the heat release in the imaged spray. The inlet air was preheated to com- pensate for the low compression ratio in the modified engine. Spray development was studied for two levels of preheating, from the start of injection to the point where all fuel was consumed. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between the amount of unburned fuel present in the cylinder and the rate of heat release at a given time. The combustion cannot be described as purely pre- mixed or purely mixing-controlled at any time, but always has an element of both. After all fuel appears to have vanished there is still an extended period of heat release. This indicates a rich combustion yielding combustible products. 2001-01-0916. Quantification of fuel concentrations and esti- mation of liquid/vapor ratios in direct-injection gasoline sprays by laser-induced fluorescence. Jean-François Le Coz and Laurent Hermani , Institut Français du Pétrole. Gasoline direct-injection sprays are studied in a pressurized ves- sel with the help of optical diagnostic techniques. Exciplex laser- induced fluorescence images show that the liquid phase is located on the edges of the spray induced recirculation zone, while the vapor 124</page><page sequence="124">2001-01-0916-2001-01-0924 is contained within this zone. These trends are particularly pro- nounced with a low ambient pressure (0.12 MPa), and a short injec- tion duration. A new method is proposed to calculate the global evaporated fuel fraction of the spray. In typical iso-octane sprays, the evaporated fuel is less than 50 % at 6 ms after start of injection, for an ambient temperature of 75 °C. A low boiling point fuel - n-pentane - is used to model the behav- ior at high temperatures, which enhances evaporation. Quantified fuel/air ratio images are obtained using laser-induced fluorescence on acetone. The accuracy is poor if high liquid concentrations exist. The fuel/air ratio often exceeds 5 in large zones. Fuel spreading depends strongly on mixing, via air entrainment. The most influen- tial parameters are ambient pressure and injection duration, and not ambient temperature under our conditions. 2001-01-0917. Improving combustion process by using a high speed UV-sensitive camera. Frank Wytrykus and Ralf Duesterw- ald, SMETEC GmbH . The ever-increasing demands on combustion engines with regard to exhaust emissions and fuel consumption require the use of mod- ern analytical methods. Especially optical measurement techniques have contributed a lot to the realization of complicated engine con- cepts. The disadvantages of complex measurement techniques are the expenditure of time and the necessary changes of the engine. This paper introduces a new practice-oriented optical measure- ment technique with the aid of an example. With this technique it is possible to record the combustion process with a sampling rate of up to 200 kHz through a small drilling. Even quick events like knocking can be recorded. The combus- tion luminosity is watched through a special UV-capable borescope, transmitted to an array of photoelectric transformers and finally recorded as a flame figure. We will show an Si-engine which is lim- ited by knocking. Analyzing the optical images will show that the combustion process tends to burn to one side of the combustion chamber. It was possible to influence the combustion with flow cor- rections which resulted in a displacement of the knocking threshold and ultimately in a higher efficiency of the engine. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0918. Measurement of the flame lift-off location on DI diesel sprays using OH chemiluminescence. Brian Higgins and Dennis Siebers , Sandia National Laboratories. The flame on a high injection pressure direct-injection (DI) die- sel spray under quiescent conditions stabilizes at a location down- stream of the fuel injector. The distance from the injector to the loca- tion of stabilization is referred to as the flame "lift-off length (or height). Air entrained into a diesel spray upstream of the flame lift- off length will mix with the injected fuel. The air and fuel premixed upstream of the lift-off length are believed to react immediately downstream of the location of flame lift-off. Recent measurements suggest that as much as 20% of the air required to burn the fuel injected is entrained prior to the flame lift-off length for typical, moderate-load, heavy-duty DI diesel conditions. These results imply that combustion at the flame lift-off location will play a pivotal role in diesel combustion and emission formation processes. However, our current understanding of how various parameters affect the lift- off length, and the resulting fuel-air premixing, is extremely limited under diesel conditions. This paper presents a line-of-sight, time-averaged OH- chemiluminescence imaging technique for determining the flame lift-off length on a DI diesel spray. The technique uses a gated, intensified CCD video camera. The image acquisition and analysis, the repeatability of lift-off length measurement, the sensitivity of the measurement to camera gain, and the effect of time varying ambient conditions on the application of the technique are dis-cussed. Also discussed are the spectral character, the spatial distribution, and the instantaneous versus time-averaged nature of the natural light emis- sion at the flame lift-off location. The investigations were carried out in an optically accessible, constant-volume combustion vessel. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0919. Local A/F measurement by chemilumines- cence OH*, CH* and C2* in SI engine. Yuji Ikeda , Makoto Kaneko, and Tsuyoshi Nakajima, KOBE Univ. The chemiluminescence emission intensity can be measured with high temporal resolution, leading to understanding the chemical reaction. Time-series chemiluminescence measurements of OH*, CH* and C2* were carried out to understand flame propagation speed, its thickness and A/F ratio of combustion status. The optical piston head (quartz) allows us to visualize combustion chamber. It is found that the chemiluminescence intensity ratio of CH*/OH* and C2*/OH* can estimate local A/F. The A/F measured by O2 sensor was used for evaluation and the results indicate this method can be applicable to estimate A/F. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0920. Measurement of flame front structure and its thickness by planar and local chemiluminescence of OH*, CH* and C2*. Yuji Ikeda, Hiroyasu Nishihara, and Tsuyoshi Nakajima, KOBE Univ. We have measured the local flame front structure and its thick- ness using high-speed three CCD camera and Developed Cassegrain optics, which could measure local OH*, CH* and C2* radicals at a point. The time-series OH*, CH* and C2* planar images are com- pared to those measured by local radical. The results show that the CH* and C2* signals can be a nice marker of flame front structure and its thickness, while OH* has some uncertainty. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0923. (SP-1573) Palladium and platinum/rhodium dual-catalyst NLEV and Tier IIa close-coupled emission solu- tions. W. B. Williamson, R. P. Richmond, J. G. Nunan, A. Bortun, and H. J. Robota, ASEC Manufacturing/Delphi Automotive Systems. Dual-monolith converters containing Pd-only catalysts followed by Pt/Rh three-way catalysts (TWCs) provide effective emission solutions for NLEV and Tier Ha close-coupled dual-bank V-8 appli- cations due to optimal hydrocarbon and NOx light-off, transient NOx control, and balance of precious metal (PGM) usage. Dual- catalyst [Pd + Pt/Rh] systems on a 5.3L V-8 LEV light truck vehicle were characterized as a function of PGM loading, catalyst technol- ogy, and substrate cell density. NLEV hydrocarbon emission control of the 6500 lb vehicle was optimal using dual 1.2L converters with each containing front ceria- free Pd catalysts coupled with rear Pt/Rh TWCs. Advanced non-air prototype calibrations coupled with reduced catalyst washcoat mass on 600 cpsi/4 mil substrate resulted in minimal Pd usage of -0.02 toz/vehicle due to achieving catalyst inlet temperatures of 350- 400°C in &lt;10 sec on both banks of the V-8 engine. The lower mass Pd washcoat contribution was -10-15 mg/mi NMHC due to improved light-off performance. The more stringent Tier IIa NOx emission levels required larger converter volumes, higher Pd content, increased oxygen-storage capacity, and higher cell density 600 cpsi/3 mil substrates. Larger dual close-coupled 1 .67L converters with front ceria-containing Pd catalysts substantially improved NOx performance during transient A/F excursions. The front Pd ceria-containing technology improved NOx by ~20mg/mi compared to the ceria-free technology, but the ceria-free technology had -10 mg/mi better NMHC control. The higher cell density 600 cpsi/3 mil substrate resulted in 10-15 mg/mi lower NOx emissions. 2001-01-0924.

The future emission limits for gasoline-fueled passenger cars require more and more efficient exhaust gas aftertreatment devices -the catalytic converter being one essential part of the complex sys- tem design. The present paper summarizes the results of several 125</page><page sequence="125">2001-01-0924-2001-01-0930 basic research programs putting major emphasis on the application of highly sophisticated three-way catalyst technologies being tay- lored for the utilization on ultra thin- wall ceramic substrates. In the first part of the investigation the following effects were examined in detail: Different washcoat loadings at constant PGM- loadings; Different volumes of catalysts for constant amounts of PGM and washcoat; Similar washcoat technologies at different ratios of WC-loading to precious metal concentration in the wash- coat. The resulting optimized washcoat system was tested in the sec- ond part of the investigation on a EU IV calibrated vehicle compar- ing a state-of-the-art 400 cpsi/6.5 mil ceramic substrate with differ- ent types of ultra thin-wall substrates (UTWS) up to 1200 cpsi / 2.5 mil. Furthermore, in case of 900 cpsi/2.5 mil two different PGM- loadings were investigated. The data of the vehicle study confirmed that UTWS in combina- tion with tailor-made coating technologies can offer a big potential to further optimize the converter performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0925.

The online pressure loss and temperature data serves to explain the functioning of the catalyst. 2001-01-0926. (SP-1573) A comparison of conversion effi- ciency and flow restriction performance of ceramic and metallic catalyst substrates. Gregory M. Pannone and John D. Mueller, DaimlerChrysler. Catalyst systems utilizing ceramic and metallic substrates were compared to assess the influence of various substrate parameters on the exhaust gas conversion efficiency and flow restriction. In partic- ular, the substrate surface area, substrate specific heat capacity, and substrate volume were all evaluated for their importance in estimat- ing the conversion efficiency of the catalyst system. Additionally, substrate open frontal area and cell hydraulic diameter were com- pared against exhaust restriction performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0927. (SP-1573) Utilization of advanced Pt/Rh TWC technologies for advanced gasoline applications with different cold-start strategies. J. Schmidt, M. Busch, A. Waltner, C. Enderle, and B. Heil, DaimlerChrysler AG; and D. Lindner, W. Mueller, L. Mussmann, E. S. Lox, and T. Kreuzer, dme2 AG. This paper describes the results of a joint development program focussing on the introduction of the new generation of Pt/Rh- technology for current and future emission standards as a cost- effective alternative to the in serial Pd/Rh-based exhaust gas con- cepts. In the initial phase of the program combinations of Pd- and Pt- based three-way catalyst technologies were evaluated on vehicles equipped with a 8 cylinder engine. One goal in this portion of the study was to achieve technical equivalence between a viable Pd- based technology and the new Pt/Rh technology in the underfloor position at lower precious metal loading. A combination of a close- coupled Pd/Rh technology and the new Pt/Rh in the underfloor posi- tion was able to meet the emission targets at significant lower costs of the system after a catalyst aging that resembles more than 100, 000 km of vehicle German highway driving. In the later phase of the program the replacement of Pd/Rh by the use of Pt/Rh in the close coupled position as well as for the underfloor position was studied at two types modern vehicles. In addition, the influence of the cold-start strategy and the contribution of high-cell density substrates was elucidated. In summary, these results prove that the new generation of Pt/Rh double-layer technology is a technical and commercial attractive alternative to the in serial Pd-based double layer technologies for high demanding applications in close-coupled as well as in under- floor positions using different cold-start strategies. Future develop- ment work will mainly focus on the further optimization of the pre- cious metal content including an OBD-control function to monitor the catalyst activity for the alternative Pt/Rh catalyst. 2001-01-0928. (SP-1573) Investigation on a novel reactor design for emission control catalysts - Modeling and experimen- tal results. J. Gieshojf, E. Lox, and Th. Kreuzer, dme 2 AG; A. Bir- tigh, Degussa-Hüls AG; and J. P. Day, P. Schmitt, and U. Zink, Cor- ning Incorporated. It is well known that the catalytic efficiency and durability of an automotive catalytic converter can be significantly affected by its design. This paper demonstrates the potential for further improve- ment in both the durability and efficiency by using a novel catalytic converter concept based on a large frontal area, high cell density substrate. This concept requires that attention be paid to optimization of the flow as well as of the mounting system. The converter design is determined with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation and the effect of this design on the temperature distribution in the substrate is calculated and measured. Due to this novel converter concept the maximum substrate tem- perature is reduced, which results in a better aging behavior. This improvement allows a reduction in precious metal content without a loss in efficiency. Investigations concerning the resonance fre- quencies of the novel converter design show no critical values with respect to automotive conditions. Experimental data using this new design will be presented and discussed and will demonstrate the potential and limits of this novel concept. 2001-01-0929. Application guideline to define catalyst layout for maximum catalytic efficiency. Per Marsh and Filip Acke, Volvo Corp.; and Roman Konieczny, Rolf Brück, and Peter Hirth, Emitec GmbH. The influence of physical parameters of the catalyst's substrate such as thermal mass, hydraulic diameter and geometric surface area on catalyst's efficiency is well known as published in numerous works. This paper will show interactions of these parameters and will provide a guideline on how to design the optimum system for a specific application, taking into account system's back pressure and system costs. Based on engine test bench results that show the influence of the physical parameters, the results for the optimized design regarding emission tests and maximum conversion rate at higher loads will be demonstrated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0930.

Further stringent emission legislation requires advanced technol- ogies, such as sophisticated engine management and advanced cata- lyst and substrate to achieve high catalytic performance, especially during the light-off phase. This paper presents the results of calcula- tions and measurements of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide light- off performance for substrates of different wall thickness, cell den- sity and cell shapes. 126</page><page sequence="126">2001-01-0930-2001-01-0937 The experimental data from catalyst light-off testing on an engine dynamometer are compared with theoretical results of com- puter modeling under different temperature ramps and flow rates. The reaction kinetics in the computer modeling are derived from the best fit for the performance of conventional ceramic substrate (6 mil/400 cpsi), by comparing the theoretical and experimental results on both HC and CO emissions. The calibrated computer model pre- dicts the effects of different wall thickness, cell density and cell shape. Different cell shapes, Triangle, Square, and Hexagon, are chosen as typical cell shapes used in the market. The substrates that are tested have the same Geometric Surface Area (GSA) on the basis of bare substrate, providing a fair basis of comparison.

(SP-1573) Monolithic metal oxide thin-wall substrates with closed and open cells: Optimal designs by theo- retical modeling and experiment. Eugene Shustorovich and Victor Shustorovich, American Scientific Materials Technologies Co. (ASMT); and Konstantin Solntsev , Russian Academy of Sciences. Recently, ASMT has developed a process of making monolithic metal oxide thin-wall structures from mechanically assembled metal preforms, whose shape and internal configuration are retained in the (oxidation) process. Because metallic designs can be extremely diverse, the same varieties of designs are now possible in metal oxide ceramics. In particular, some unique metallic designs such as spiral winding structures (formed from flat and corrugated layers) with either closed or open cells have been realized for the first time in ceramics, such as hematite Fe203 and titania (rutile) TÍO2. In order to optimize these new ceramic designs, we have developed a theoretical model of layer distribution of mechanical stresses under external uniform radial pressure and of thermal stresses under typi- cal heating/cooling regimes. The stress distribution is determined by various parameters, both structural (cell size and geometry, wall thickness, number of layers, etc.) and material (tensile wall strength, Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, etc.). The analyti- cal formalism and computational program are highlighted. Model results are presented for a variety of hematite and titania substrates, having closed or open cell structure, a cell density from 200 to 1000 cpsi, and wall thickness from 1 to 5 mils. Recommendations on opti- mal designs are given and supported by relevant experimental data. Automotive applications of new metal oxide thin-wall substrates are discussed. 2001-01-0932. (SP-1573) Modeling the effect of substrate cell shape on conversion in monolith catalysts. C. T. Góralski , Jr. and T. B. Chanko, Ford Motor Co. Mass transfer limitations from the bulk gas phase to the surface of the catalyst as well as mass transfer limitations within the wash- coat itself have important effects on conversion in washcoated monolith catalysts. These factors depend upon the shape of the chan- nel as well as the loading of washcoat material. This paper outlines a method to describe the washcoat distribution profile for different channel shapes and washcoat loadings. This allows for prediction of effectiveness factors and bulk mass transfer coefficients as a function of cell geometry and washcoat loading for the oxidation of propane. It was found that differences in the diffusion limitations within the washcoat control conversion in the catalyst more than dif- ferences in bulk mass transfer rates when comparing different cell shapes. The results show that optimum washcoat loadings exist for the geometry of each cell, and that these optimum loadings are a function of catalyst temperature. These optimum loadings vary from ~12% for hexagonal channels at 1300 K to over 50% for triangular channels at 800 K. In general, hexagonal channels and square chan- nels show similar performance at high temperature and washcoat loadings above 20%, while triangular channels show poorer perfor- mance under all conditions. In addition, it was found that slab approximations for effectiveness factors provide reasonable values for the effectiveness factor for square and hexagonal channels at washcoat loadings above 20%. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0933. New catalyst preparation procedure for OBDII-monitoring requirements. Margret M. Schmidt , Shell Global Solutions ; Michael J. Brady and Craig Summers , Daimler- Chrysler ; and Meike Re i zig, Rolf Brück, and Jürgen Breuer , Emitec GmbH. In order to match catalyst OBDII conditions the common proce- dure is oven aging with air, which is not suitable for complete con- verter systems due to mantle corrosion. The goal was, therefore, to find an alternative procedure to ensure a defined catalyst aging that would match 1,75 times the emission standard and is also good for SULEV.

(SP-1573) Shear strength of cordierite ceramic catalyst supports. Suresh T. Gulati, Thomas Leonhard ', and Timo- thy A. Roe , Corning Incorporated. An analytical model for estimating shear and bending stresses during canning of cordierite ceramic catalyst supports is presented. These stresses arise when the radial pressure distribution is nonuni- form due, primarily, to variations in gap bulk density (GBD) of intu- mescent mat around the perimeter of the substrate. Variations in GBD can occur during canning, regardless of the canning technique, due to anisotropic can stiffness or component tolerances or mat overlap. The model helps relate shear and bending stresses to sub- strate size and orientation, elastic modulii, cell size and wall poros- ity. If these stresses approach the corresponding strength of sub- strate, a shear crack may develop during or after the canning process depending on the magnitude of stress. A special test fixture was developed to measure the shear strength of ceramic catalyst supports, with different cell sizes, before and after the application of washcoat. The shear and bending stresses at failure, as predicted by the model, were compared with the measured values. The agreement was found to be good lending credence to the model. The model should prove valuable in optimiz- ing the packaging system such that the shear and bending stresses during canning are kept below the threshold limit of substrate. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0936. (SP- 1605) Microkinetics modeling of catalytic converters. Suresh Sriramulu, Patrice D. Moore , J. P. Mello , and Robert S. Weber , Arthur D. Little , Inc. The task of matching engine, control system and catalytic con- verter has become very complex as the automotive industry strives to meet stringent demands for pollution abatement. To address the need for a robust, accurate modeling tool we have created a micro- kinetics-based simulation program that describes the reactions tak- ing place on the surface of a catalytic converter. This chemically detailed approach permits the construction of faithful simulations of both steady state and transient performance of the catalyst using a combination of experimental measurements, literature data and quantum chemical calculations. The model can be coupled to exist- ing simulations of the engine and control elements, notably those based on GT-Power. 2001-01-0937. (SP- 1605) On a model-based control of a three- way catalytic converter. M. Balenovic, A. C. P. M. Backx , and J. H. B. J. Hoebink, Eindhoven University of Technology. Though very important for the system performance, the dynamic behavior of the catalytic converter has mainly been neglected in the design of exhaust emission control systems. Since the major dynamic effects stem from the oxygen storage capabilities of the catalytic converter, a novel model-based control scheme, with the 127</page><page sequence="127">2001-01-0937-2001-01-0942 explicit control of the converter's oxygen storage level is proposed. The controlled variable cannot be measured, so it has to be predicted by an on-line running model (inferential sensor). The model accu- racy and adaptability are therefore crucial. A simple algorithm for the model parameter identification is developed. All tests are per- formed on a previously developed first principle model of the cata- lytic converter so that the controller effectiveness and performance can clearly be observed. 2001-01-0938. (SP- 1605) An Integrated Powertrain (IPT) model - Stage 2: Systems integration, supervisory control and simulation of emissions control technology. P. M. Fussey, C. L. Goodfellow, K. K. Oversby , B. C. Porter, and J. C. Wheals, Ricardo pic. This paper follows on from a previous publication [1] and describes the continued development of a generic Integrated Powertrain (IPT) model. Simulation tools have been used for many years in engine and vehicle development programs, to predict fuel consumption and emissions over various drive cycles. The concept phase of these pro- grams typically considers the overall layout and sizing of the com- ponents, with the detailed control strategies developed later. Today, the increased integration of vehicle sub-systems requires a high degree of overall control early in the program, firstly, to allow the sub-systems to function, and secondly, to apply a similar quality of system control to each hardware iteration. To address this issue, a control hierarchy has been applied com- prising of a supervisor controller and multiple local controllers. The supervisor controller is developed early in the program to allow the system integration to yield initial performance estimates, whilst the detailed local control strategies can be developed later. The IPT model has also been extended to include generic sub- models of catalysts and particulate traps, allowing prediction of drive cycle emissions. These sub-models permit parameters such as substrate, size and position and, where applicable, regeneration strategy of the components to be evaluated. 2001-01-0939. (SP- 1605) ID unsteady flows with chemical reactions in the exhaust duct-system of S.I. engines: Predictions and experiments. A. Onorati, G. Ferrari, and G. D'Errico, Poly- technic University of Milan. This paper describes some recent advances of the research work concerning the ID fluid dynamic modeling of unsteady reacting flows in S.I. engine pipe-systems, including pre-catalysts and main catalysts. The numerical model GASDYN developed in previous work has been further enhanced to enable the simulation of the cata- lyst. The main chemical reactions occurring in the wash-coat have been accounted in the model, considering the mass transfer between gas and solid phase. The oxidation of CO, C3H6, C3H8, H2 and reduction of NO, the steam-reforming reactions of C3H6, C3H8, the water-gas shift reaction of CO have been considered. Moreover, an oxygen-storage sub-model has been introduced, to account for the behavior of Cerium oxides. A detailed thermal model of the con- verter takes into account the heat released by the exothermic reac- tions as a source term in the heat transfer equations. The influence of the insulating mat is accounted. The ID fluid dynamic model developed has been applied to the simulation of the unsteady flows with transport of reacting chemical species in the exhaust manifold of a Fiat-AlfaRomeo four-cylinder, 2.0L automotive S.I. engine, which adopts two close-coupled metallic pre-catalysts and a main ceramic catalyst. A satisfactory agreement between predicted results and measured data has been achieved. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0940. (SP- 1605) A modular numerical simulation tool predicting catalytic converter light-off by improved model- ing of thermal management and conversion characteristics. S. Büchner, S. Santos Lardies, A. Degen, A. Donnerstag, and W. Held, Volkswagen AG. Strict legislation standards for automotive emission limits (e.g. ULEV, SULEV), which target for HC conversion rates beyond 99%, impose the necessity to dramatically shorten catalyst light-off time and increase catalytic efficiency through improved catalytic converter heat-up. Especially, in early design stages, modeling ther- mal energy management is crucial to predict whether emissions standards can be met. The CAE method (Computer-Aided Engineering) presented in this study gives the flexibility composing the frontal exhaust system from modular numerical models, which describe heat transfer in sin- gle exhaust components, as e.g., takedown-pipes, flexible coupling element (FCE), flanges and conversion characteristics in catalytic converter. Each module upstream of the converter internally couples the energy equations of ID-gas to lD/2D-solid-structure, including heat transfer mechanism as radiation, natural and forced convection. An existing three way catalyst (TWC) program (ID) balances energy and mass conservation in the converter, to model heteroge- neous surface reactions and heat transfer in the solid, as well as mass and heat transfer in the gas phase. Transient emissions and tempera- ture measurements required for inlet boundary conditions and vali- dation of the composed model derived from dynamometer measure- ments of a 2.0 1 - 2V SI engine in transient driving cycle. Focused on improving the light-off and conversion behavior of the start-up brick in the first 30 seconds of the FTP 75 cycle, varying design parameters, as geometry changes, variations in engine out emissions, thermal capacities and insulation, have been investigated. It proves that in the converter underfloor position a major part of upstream heat losses occur in the FCE, resulting in decisive HC break-through during the light-off delay. Therefore, some effort has been put into developing and tuning a numerical model of the FCE, validated with temperature measurements on an engine test bench. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0941. (SP- 1605) The solution for steady-state tem- perature distribution in monolithic catalytic converters. Fong Z. Li and David K. S. Chen, Delphi Automotive Systems. This paper presents a simplified thermal model for round cata- lytic converters in steady state operation. Using this model, the ana- lytic solution for the temperature distribution in the monolithic sub- strate is obtained. This analytic solution in the substrate is, then, combined with those in the intumescent mat and the metal shell to obtain the temperature profile in the radial direction of the converter except for three unknown temperatures at the three material inter- faces, which can be solved using an Excel application program. This analytical temperature solution facilitates the studies of the effects of various design parameters such as the exhaust gas temperature, exhaust gas flow rate, substrate cell geometry, converter dimen- sions, and ambient temperature and flow, etc. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0942. (SP- 1605) Optimum gap design and durability analysis of catalytic converter assembly. Yuting Rui, George Xu, Masumi Kawatsu, Derlon Chu, and Paul Yu, Ford Motor Co. A method to predict gap distribution, can deformation and mounting force of catalytic converter during assembling and opera- tion cycles has been developed using ABAQUS contact algorithm with user subroutine for material properties. Inherent in the method- ology is the constitutive model for both vermiculite mat and wire mesh mounting materials, which is able to describe their nonlinear and thermal behaviors and shows good agreement with test results. A design optimization procedure is presented to achieve uniform gap design of can and substrate. The technology will enable engi- neers to generate robust converter can designs, substrate shape and stamping tools for minimum manufacturing failure rate and maxi- mum durability performance once a mounting material is selected. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 128</page><page sequence="128">2001-01-0943-2001-01-0951 2001-01-0943. (SP- 1605) Numerical analysis of the exhaust gas flow and heat transfer in a close-coupled catalytic converter system during warm-up. Koudai Yoshizawa, Kouji Mori , and Shuji Kimura, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A new multidimensional calculation method has been developed to simulate the warm-up characteristics of close-coupled catalytic converter systems. First, a one-dimensional gas exchange simula- tion and a three-dimensional exhaust gas flow calculation are com- bined to simulate the pulsation gas flow caused by the gas exchange process. The gas flow calculation and a heat transfer calculation are then combined to simulate heat transfer in the exhaust manifold and the catalyst honeycomb under pulsation flow. The predicted warm-up characteristics of the systems examined agreed well with the experimental data. In this simulation, CPU time was reduced greatly through the use of new calculation methods. Finally, the warm-up process of close-coupled catalysts is analyzed in detail with this simulation method. The design requirements for improving warm-up characteristics have been made clear. This simulation pro- cedure is an effective design tool for developing close-coupled cata- lytic converter systems which have quick warm-up characteristics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0944. (SP- 1605) Three-dimensional numerical study on the pulsating flow inside automotive muffler with compli- cated flow path. Min-Ho Kim , Kia Motors Corp. Exhaust system is composed of several parts. Among them, design of muffler system strongly influences on engine efficiency and noise reduction. Hence, thorough comprehension of flow char- acteristics inside muffler is necessary. In this study, three- dimensional steady and unsteady compressible flow analysis was performed to understand the flow characteristics, pressure loss and amplitude variation of pulsating pressure. The computational grid generation was carried out. And the three-dimensional fluid motion inside the muffler was analyzed by STAR-CD, the computational fluid dynamics code. RNG k-e turbulence model was applied to con- sider the complexity of the geometry and fluid motion. The steady and unsteady flow field inside muffler such as velocity distribution, pulsating pressure and pressure loss was examined. In case of unsteady state analysis, velocity of inlet region was converted from measured pulsating pressure. Experimental measurement of pres- sure and temperature was carried out to provide the boundary and initial condition for computational study under the engine operating conditions. Computational results show that the pressure drop is derived from the sudden reduction and the sudden expansion effect of the baffle plates, located in the middle of chamber, and heavily depends on the variation of the flow direction. It is also found in good agreement within 6% of the measured values. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0947. (SP- 1576) A study on the service interval per- formance of borated and non-borated glycol ether brake fluids. J. B. W. Morsink, M. G. F. M. van Grieken, and R. de Jong , Shell International Chemicals BV. There is a quite a wide range of brake fluid performance parame- ters affecting the lifetime of a brake fluid while in service in a car. However, in particular a high boiling point stands out as one of the most important product characteristics, in order to provide adequate protection against vapor lock in a car's brake system. Using laboratory experiments and on the road car trials, we have investigated a number of key parameters that affect brake fluid ser- vice life. In particular we have compared the boiling performance of DOT 3 versus DOT 4 brake fluid types, i.e., non-borated versus borated glycol ether-based types. The results lead us to the conclu- sion that DOT 4 compared to DOT 3 brake fluid offers consistently better boiling point performance; i.e., up to several years DOT 4 offers a considerable better margin against vapor lock. Furthermore, comparing different types of DOT 4 fluids in vari- ous car trials, we obtained solid evidence that higher wet boiling point fluids offer the potential to increase the service interval, pro- vided the brake system minimizes moisture ingestion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0948. (SP- 1576) Numerical study of brake disc cool- ing accounting for both aerodynamic drag force and cooling efficiency. Anders Jerhamre and Christer Bergström, Volvo Car Corp. This paper reports how numerical simulation can be used as a tool to guide vehicle design with respect to brake cooling demands. Detailed simulations of different brake cooling concepts are com- pared with experimental results. The paper consists of two parts. The first part places the empha- sis on how to model the flow inside and around the brake disc. The boundary layer and the pumping effect is investigated for a venti- lated single rotor. The numerical results will be compared to experi- mental results. In the second part, an engineering approach is applied in order to rank different technical solutions on a Volvo S 80 vehicle in terms of brake cooling and aerodynamic drag. The results from the free brake disc simulations indicate that the tangential velocity can be predicted with high accuracy, e.g., stan- dard k-e model with prism near wall cells typically within 4 % of measured data. The pumping effect, i.e., the radial velocity was somewhat poorly predicted, although within 15% using standard k-£ model. On the complete vehicle simulations, trends for both aerody- namic drag and brake cooling were captured for the cases consid- ered. This implies that CFD is a useful tool in evaluating different brake cooling design concepts. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0950. (SP- 1576) Study on brake squeal by feed-in energy analysis. Guan Dihua and Huang Jinchun, Tsinghua Univ. Brake squeal noise is studied in this paper by feed-in energy anal- ysis. Based on the closed-loop coupling brake model, the computa- tion method of feed-in energy is derived for the system squeal mode. The amount of feed-in energy can indicate the degree of squeal ten- dency of the brake system. Feed-in energy analysis can clearly reveal the influence of some structural parameters on brake noise, such as coefficient of friction, the geometric shape and stiffness of pads, and key substructure modal shape. It also can help to analyze the structure modification to eliminate brake squeal. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-0951. (SP-1607) Evaluating commercial and proto- type HE Vs. Feng An, Anant Vy as, John Anderson, and Danilo San- tini, Ar gonne National Laboratory. In recent years, vehicle manufacturers have made great progress in developing and demonstrating commercially available and proto- typed hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). These vehicles include com- mercially available gasoline hybrid cars (Toyota Prius and Honda Insight) and Partnership for the Next Generation Vehicle (PNGV) diesel hybrid prototypes (Ford Prodigy, GM Precept, and Daimler- Chrysler ESX3). In this paper, we discuss tested and claimed fuel benefits and performance of these commercial and prototyped HEVs relative to conventional vehicles (CVs) that are otherwise similar to these HEVs, except for hybridization. We also describe a reverse- engineering approach to de-hybridize or "conventionalize" these five existing commercial and prototyped HEVs. Because these com- mercial and prototyped HEVs represent a variety of technological choices, configurations, and development stages, this analysis gives us in-depth knowledge about how each of these vehicles achieves high efficiency. An Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) compo- nent sizing model (HEVCOST) and a conventional vehicle fuel economy and performance model (Modal Energy and Emissions Model [MEEM]) are used to aid our analysis. To cross check the results, we also run the hybrid simulation model ADVISOR. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 129</page><page sequence="129">2001-01-0953-2001-01-0958 2001-01-0953. (SP-1607) Validation process of a HEV system analysis model: PSAT. Aymeric Rousseau , Phil Sharer , and Max- ime Pasquier ; Argonne National Laboratory . Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) combine two sources of energy and offer a wide variety of component and drivetrain configurations. However, optimizing the blending of these two energy sources is complex. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), working with the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), maintains hybrid vehicle simulation software, the PNGV System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). PSAT allows users to choose the best configuration and to optimize the control strategy in simulations. The importance of component models and the complexity involved in setting up optimized control laws require validation of the models and control strategies developed in PSAT. In this paper, we first describe our capability to validate each component model with an actual compo- nent test, using test stand facilities. Once each component model has been validated, ANL can perform tests on a whole HEV by using a chassis dynamometer. So, we also present the differences between the measured and simulated results. Finally, we explain the tuning of the simulated vehicle control strategy, based on the analysis of these differences. In this way, we demonstrate the validation of PSAT component models, and then the control strategy tuning, using HEV test data. 2001-01-0954. (SP-1607) Integration of a modal energy and emissions model into a PNGV vehicle simulation model, PSAT. Feng An and Aymeric Rousseau , Argonne National Laboratory . This paper describes the integration of a Modal Energy and Emissions Model (MEEM) into a hybrid-electric vehicle simulation model, the PNGV System Analytic Toolkits (PSAT). PSAT is a for- ward-looking computer simulation model for advanced-technology vehicles. MEEM is a vehicle fuel-consumption and emissions model developed by one of the authors for internal-combustion-engine (ICE) -powered vehicles. MEEM engine simulation module uses a power-demand physical model based on a parameterized analytical representation of engine fuel and emissions production. One major advantage of MEEM is that it does not rely on steady-state engine maps, which are usually not available for most production vehicles; rather, it depends on a list of engine parameters that are calibrated based on regular vehicle dynamometer testing. The integrated PSAT-MEEM model can be used effectively to predict fuel con- sumption and emissions of various ICE-powered vehicles with both conventional and hybrid power trains. This paper also presents a methodology used by MEEM to generate simulated engine maps based on vehicle dynamometer testing. For illustration purposes, engine performance maps of a model year 1997 (MY97) Taurus engine and a model year 1999 (MY99) Toyota Prius Atkinson-cycle engine generated by MEEM are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0955.

(SP-1607) Super HEV system for super low floor city-bus. Naotake Kumagai, Akira Motooka, Nobuaki Takeda, and Yuta Susuki, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. This paper deals with the superb hybrid-electric vehicle to be put to use as a super-low-floor city bus - a highly efficient vehicle which can offer both excellent fuel economy and low emissions of exhaust gas. In order that oil resources may be put to more effective use, the research and development activities described herein aimed at real- izing a vehicle with lower energy consumption, higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption, and also cleaner exhaust gasses than those of diesel-engine busses which are traditionally used in urban envi- ronments. A series-type implementation was adopted for the hybrid electrical-drive system in order that a higher degree of energy effi- ciency could be achieved. Furthermore, the newly-developed high- performance lithium ion batteries were adopted for use in this vehi- cle. In addition to this, the use of super-wide, single tires in combi- nation with the hybrid system permitted a high degree of flexibility in the arrangement of mechanical components; consequently, the width of the rear pathway could be increased to 1 .7 times the con- ventional size. And as a result of this modification, it was possible to realize an epoch-making stepless bus with a wide, low floor. Fur- thermore, this development project was also successful in the cre- ation of a more- welcoming, new-generation HEV bus system which removes barriers to usage by wheelchair-confined persons and all other types of passenger. The next step in this project involved the analysis of fuel- efficiency and exhaust-gas characteristics. The results of these activ- ities showed that, in comparison to manual-transmission vehicles running on regular diesel fuel, fuel consumption levels were reduced by approximately 37%; and when compared with automatic- transmission vehicles, the level of improvement increased to approximately 40%. Furthermore, it was also learned that levels of exhaust-gas emission (specifically, NOx) were reduced by 50%, thus confirming the highly-efficient and highly-clean nature of the bus in question. 2001-01-0957. (SP-1607) Development of switched reluctance motor for EV traction system. Chiaki Umemura, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd. Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) mainly has two advanta- geous characteristics such as no magnet and simple construction. These characteristics contribute lower cost and higher reliability compared with other motor systems such as brushless permanent magnet motors or induction motors. However, acoustic noise and output torque ripple should be improved when the SRM is applied to a traction system for passenger electric vehicle since these charac- teristics directly affect vehicle quietness and drivability. In this paper, we describe a system configuration of the SRM traction system for passenger electric vehicle. The SRM traction system includes an electric motor, transmission gears and power inverter module. Then, an approach to improve acoustic noise and output torque ripple is introduced. Generation mechanisms of acous- tic noise and output torque ripple are analyzed. It is found that reduction of magnetic attractive force between a motor stator and a rotor is very important factor to reduce acoustic noise and output torque ripple. We have developed a control algorithm to optimize the magnetic attractive force. This control algorithm is verified and evaluated through dynamometer and actual vehicle tests. As a result, we have successfully developed the SRM traction system which can be applicable for passenger electric vehicle. 2001-01-0958.

(SP- 1607) A review of cell equalization meth- ods for lithium ion and lithium polymer battery systems. Stephen W. Moore and Peter J. Schneider , Delphi Automotive Systems. Lithium-based battery technology offers performance advan- tages over traditional battery technologies at the cost of increased monitoring and controls overhead. Multiple-cell Lead- Acid battery packs can be equalized by a controlled overcharge, eliminating the need to periodically adjust individual cells to match the rest of the pack. Lithium-based based batteries cannot be equalized by an over- charge, so alternative methods are required. This paper discusses several cell-balancing methodologies. Active cell balancing meth- ods remove charge from one or more high cells and deliver the charge to one or more low cells. Dissipative techniques find the high cells in the pack, and remove excess energy through a resistive ele- ment until their charges match the low cells. This paper presents the theory of charge balancing techniques and the advantages and disad- vantages of the presented methods. 2001-01-0960. (SP- 1607) Battery modeling for HEY simula- tion model development. Xiaoling He , Georgia Institute of Tech- nology. Battery modeling is of major concern for Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) and Electric vehicle (EV) modeling. The major issue lies in characterizing the battery power output in relation to battery's State of Charge (SOC) in various application conditions. In particular, the challenge is associated with the difficulty that the characteristic parameters of the battery, i.e., the accurate data on the open circuit voltage and the internal resistance are hardly obtainable in practical conditions. In this paper, a battery capacity representation and a practical way of battery modeling is introduced for simulation model devel- opment based on the experimental data. A realistic way of battery SOC representation is generated from the battery output data. Empirical formulation is derived from the data to correlate the bat- tery current, voltage output with the battery SOC. The methodology provides an alternative for battery modeling when battery open circuit voltage, Voc, and resistant, R, as a func- tion of battery SOC are not available. It generates up-to-date repre- sentation of the battery power capacity. The battery modeling is interchangeable with the model developed with Voc, and R specifi- cation. It is also adaptable for different power control strategy with interchangeable input and output parameters for battery modeling. The accuracy of the model is validated by comparison of the output between the new approach with that based on Voc and R as in ADVISOR, a HEV simulation model developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 2001-01-0961.

Among the research and development subjects of ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technology, Energy and Environment) an important theme is the study of innovative vehicles with high energy efficiency and low emissions. ENEA has set up an infrastruc- ture in order to execute research and development activity for hybrid and electrical vehicles. The paper deals with features and working methods throughout the testing campaign on the ALTRA minibus drivetrain, a 6m. series hybrid developed by IVECO and ANS- ALDO. The test demonstrated that the energy consumption is strongly correlated to the power management strategy. Subse- quently, a testing work was carried on with a controller developed by ENEA and University of Pisa, by using the roll bench of ENEA, while the IVECO tested on the road another control system. All these tests convalidates the need of a controller to achieve fuel economy. 2001-01-0962. (SP- 1584) Development of fan spray simula- tion for gasoline direct injection engines. Atsuya Okamoto, Takaaki Sato, and Naotaka Shirabe, Denso Corp.; and Yukinobu Anezaki , Nippon Soken, Inc. In gasoline direct injection engines it is important to optimize fuel spray characteristics, which strongly affect stratified combus- tion process. Spray simulation is anticipated as a tool for optimizing nozzle design, but conventional simulation, which is based on experimental data and/or empirical laws regarding spray boundary condition at the nozzle exit, cannot predict the effect of various noz- zle geometries on spray characteristics. In Japan, a fan spray injected from a slit type nozzle has recently been adopted for gaso- line direct injection engines. This paper proposes a computational model for the fan spray. The structure of two-phase flow inside the nozzle is numerically analyzed using the volume of fluid (VOF) method in a three-dimensional CFD code based on the nozzle geom- etry. The results of these analyses are applied to classical linear instability theory to calculate fuel droplet mean diameter after pri- mary breakup. These results lead the boundary condition at the noz- zle exit for the spray simulation instead of experimental data and/or empirical laws. The conventional discrete droplet model (DDM) and many sub-models are used for spray calculation. Spray tip penetra- tion, Sauter mean diameter (SMD), and spray mass flow distribution are verified for various atmospheric pressures and nozzle geometries. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0963. (SP-1584) Modeling of internal flow in high pressure swirl injectors. J. Cousin, Université et INSA de Rouen; and H. J. Nuglisch, Siemens Automotive. First, this paper presents four models (three zero- and a one- dimensional model) for predicting injector performances. The theo- retical approaches of these four models are presented in details. A critical review of these models has been made possible by using a huge experimental database where more than 3000 injectors have been experimentally tested. In particular, authors show that the one- dimensional model allows a very accurate prediction of both static flow rate and cone angle and takes into account more internal dimensions than the zero-dimensional models. In a second part of the paper, a coupling between the one-dimensional model with a model that predicts the linear stability of conical sheets is proposed. This coupling allows the determination of a theoretical drop diame- ter that is representative of the large droplets of the spray. An illus- tration of this coupling is proposed by comparing theoretical drop diameter with the experimental Sauter mean diameter for one injec- tor tested in a large range of injection pressure (5-100 bar). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0964. (SP-1584) Technique for analyzing swirl injec- tors of direct-injection gasoline engines. Masaaki Kubo, Akihiro Sakakida, and Akihiro Uyama, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper describes the numerical and experimental approaches that were applied to study swirl injectors that are widely used in direct-injection gasoline engines. As the numerical approach, the fuel and air flow inside an injector was first analyzed by using a two- phase flow analysis method [VOF (Volume of Fluid) model]. A time-series analysis was made of the flow though the injector and also of the air cavity that forms at the nozzle and influences fuel atomization. The calculated results made clear the process from ini- tial spray formation to liquid film formation. Spray droplet forma- tion was then analyzed with the synthesized spheroid particle (SSP) method. As the experimental approach, in order to measure the cav- ity factor that represents the liquid film thickness, nozzle exit flow velocities were measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Pre- viously, these high velocities have been difficult to measure, but a newly developed PIV system using two CCD cameras to capture high-speed flow has made such measurement possible.

(SP- 1584) Modeling the effect of split injec- tions on DISI engine performance. Gunnar Stiesch and Guenter P. Merker, University of Hanover; and Zhichao Tan and Rolf D . Reitz, University of Wisconsin. A spray model for pressure-swirl atomizers that is based on a lin- earized instability analysis of liquid sheets has been combined with an ignition and combustion model for stratified charge spark igni- tion engines. The ignition model has been advanced, such that the presence of dual spark plugs can now be accounted for. Independent validation of the spray model is achieved by investi- gating a pressure-swirl injector inside a pressure bomb containing air at ambient temperature. In a second step, the complete model is used to estimate the performance of a small marine DISI Two- Stroke engine operating in stratified charge mode. Simulation results and experimental data are compared for several different injection timings and the agreement is generally good such that there is confidence in the predictive quality of the combustion model. Finally the model is applied in a conceptual study to investigate possible benefits of split injections. The simulation results suggest that both fuel economy and NOx-emissions can be improved when a two-pulse injection is used such that the late injected, stratified fuel ensures stable ignition at the spark plug whereas the early injected, diluted fuel reduces the maximum combustion temperature and controls NOx-formation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0966. (SP- 1584) Direct injection of variable gasoline/ methanol mixtures: Injection and spray characteristics. C. Stan and R. Tröger, West Saxon University of Zwickau; and C. N. Gri- maldi and L. Postrioti, University of Perugia. The injection rate modulation and the spray characteristics are determining factors for the quality of mixture formation when applying GDI. Their variation with load and speed is a basic crite- rion for the adaptability of a type of injection system to an engine with known requirements. The increased interest for the utilization of regenerative fuels - such as methanol obtained from biomass - as well as the success of previous utilization scenarios of variable gaso- line/methanol mixture using manifold injection formed the base of the present analysis: the paper describes the results concerning injection performances and spray characteristics when using gaso- line/methanol mixtures with different ratios in a direct injection sys- tem with high pressure modulation. The results are compared for different parameters of the injection systems as follows: injection volume, injector opening pressure, needle lift, pintle/seat geometry. The injection performance and the time-related spray characteristics using a laser sheet technique were analyzed for different gasoline/ methanol ratios. The influence of mixture content on the injection parameters results as moderate. This is a valid argument for model- ing and optimization of the internal mixture formation process using direct injection of gasoline/methanol mixtures. 2001-01-0967. (SP- 1584) Developments in the use of multi- purpose numerical simulation tools to optimize combustion con- trol parameters for the 2nd generation of lean-burn stratified GDI engines. M. Pontoppidan and G. Gaviani, Magneti Marelli; and G. Bella, A. De Malo, and M. Schilardi, Università Tor Vergata. The first part of the paper gives an overview of the current results obtained with the first generation of GDI-powered vehicles launched on the European market. In view of the rather limited suc- cess in fuel consumption gain, the second generation of very lean stratified layouts has begun, but this process requires the develop- ment and application of new high-level analysis tools. A possible high-performance approach is the multi-purpose use of 3-D numeri- cal simulation both in the development and the engine control strat- egy calibration phases. The development of a small 1.6-liter lean stratified engine project was chosen to demonstrate the dual applica- tion capability of the NCF-3D simulation tool. The paper continues with a description of the engine application frame, the basic features of the NCF-3D simulation tool and the lat- est enhancements made to combustion and fuel composition models within the software frame. Hereafter is given a description of the particular computation cluster layout necessary for the use of the numerical simulation tool in the engine control strategy calibration phase. Two significant application examples are given, both related to the 1 .6-liter engine development. The first relates to the research and development phase the other to the calibration phase. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential of the Computational Cluster Optimization approach to offer a solution which can help to limit the very important work to fine tune the sec- ond generation of GDI engines. 2001-01-0968. (SP-1584) Air-fuel mixing in a homogeneous charge DI gasoline engine. Martin Gold, John Stokes, and Robert Morgan, Ricardo; and Morgan Heikal, Guillaume de Sercey, and Steve Begg, University of Brighton. For optimum efficiency, the direct injection (DI) gasoline engine requires two operating modes to cover the full load/speed map. For lower loads and speeds, stratified charge operation can be used, while homogeneous charge is required for high loads and speeds. This paper has focused its attention on the latter of these modes, where the performance is highly dependent on the quality of the fuel spray, evaporation and the air-fuel mixture preparation. Results of quantitative and qualitative Laser Induced Fluores- cence (LIF) measurements are presented, together with shadow- graph spray imaging, made within an optically accessed DI gasoline engine. These are compared with previously acquired air flow mea- surements, at various injection timings, and with engine perfor- mance and emissions data obtained in a fired single cylinder non- optical engine, having an identical cylinder head and piston crown geometry. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0969. (SP-1584) An experimental study on fuel behavior during the cold-start period of a direct-injection spark-ignition engine. Nobuhiko Koga, Toyota Motor Europe Mar- keting and Engineering; Shigeki Miyashita and Keiso Takeda, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Nobuo Imatake, Nippon Soken, Inc. An experimental study was carried out in order to reduce engine- out HC emissions from a direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine during the cold-start period. The objectives of this study were to investigate the fuel behavior quantified with an analytic method and to propose some practical techniques to reduce the cyl- inder-wetting fuel volume and engine-out HC emissions. Compared to the MPI (Multi-Port Fuel Injection) engine, required fuel volume for DISI engine was reduced during the cold start because intake port wall-wetting was not generated. On the other hand, a large volume of cylinder wetting fuel resulted in engine-out HC emissions. Injection timing, atomization and vapor- ization of injected fuel affected the cylinder-wetting fuel volume. Above all, injection of the heated fuel provided good results. In summary, engine-out HC emissions from DISI engine was reduced compared to that of MPI engine during the cold-start period. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-0970.

This may be realized by using different combustion concepts. This paper shows the analysis of mixture preparation for three different types of direct-injected gasoline engines. Each engine was driven with two injectors which have two different atomization con- cepts. The engine types draw a clear dividing line between their combustion concepts. The injectors were analyzed in a pressure chamber, in an optical engine, and in an actual 1 -cylinder engine. The formation of wall-film in wall-guided combustion systems will be discussed. Several important injector and engine parameters for fuel direct injection are pointed out. The experimental tools used are the Laser-Induced Exciplex Fluorescence (LIEF), Schlieren and light-scattering techniques, as well as shadowgraphy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0971. Inserted tool design using FEA - Technique extended to 3D. Mehul A. Dharia, Amcast Industrial Corp. Elkhart Industrial Division of Amcast Industrial Corporation uses a patented process called FORMCAST™, to produce near-net shaped automotive components with superior mechanical proper- ties. The very high pressure generated in the complex forming cavity necessitates a need for an inserted tool design to reduce stresses. Previously, at SAE 1998, the usefulness of using a general pur- pose FEA software was demonstrated using an inserted tooling sim- ulated in 2D. The extension of this technique to 3D is quite demand- ing but today's computers and software make such a simulation pos- sible and helps in the development of advanced processes without building numerous prototype dies. This paper is intended to demonstrate that by using a 3D case study simulation of tooling for a Miniblock, which is a car air- conditioner component that the simulation to actual results will correlate. 2001-01-0972. Manufacturing of bladder fuel tank for vapor- reducing fuel tank system. Tatsutoshi Takas hima, Teijiro Goto , Hisamitsu Kato , and Junichi Sugimoto, Horie Metal Co., Ltd. To reduce the amount of fuel vapor created in the fuel tank, we developed a variable-capacity, plastic bladder fuel tank that is effi- cient, reliable, and provides permeation prevention performance. This bladder fuel tank changes in shape and total capacity in accordance with the volume of fuel it holds. Thus, in contrast to the conventional fuel tank, it can dramatically reduce the amount of fuel vapor that is ordinarily created in the fuel tank while the vehicle is being refueled, parked, or driven. The bladder fuel tank has been adopted in the Vapor-Reducing Fuel Tank System of the North American model Prius, a vehicle that operates under the Toyota Hybrid System (THS), which complies with the SULEV exhaust emission requirement. This paper primarily gives an outline of the technology for manu- facturing the bladder fuel tank. 2001-01-0973. Machining of automobile engine cams using two cutting tools controlled with linear servomotors. Y. Nakao, Kanagawa Univ. A machine tool with four-control axis for machining of engine cams is presented and built to improve a machining efficiency in this study. A workpiece is fixed at a spindle chuck and placed between two cutting tools on the machine tool. Positions of the cutting direc- tion of two cutting tools are controlled independently with two lin- ear servomotors set on a linear rail guide. The linear servomotors are controlled with a PC, various products with non-circular cross sections can be then machined by the machine tool. Machining experiments shows that the machine tool is effective to reduce machining time and improve machining accuracy. 2001-01-0974. New laser-based, solid free form fabrication technology revolutionizes die/mold building and restoration. C. P. ( Chuck) Azzopardi, POM Group, Inc. This presentation will review the Direct Metal Deposition (DMD™) process, highlighting benefits that DMD can bring to the automotive industry ~ with specific focus on the advantages it can provide to the manufacture and restoration of injection molds and dies. DMD, an additive laser-based fabrication process, is an enabling technology for tool builders looking to build longer lasting, less expensive, or highly efficient dies and molds. In the past, it has been impossible to incorporate advantages of multiple materials in mold designs. DMD changes this. Using DMD, it is now possible to construct dies with the tough- ness of P20 tool steel at their cores and the wear and corrosion resis- tance of HI 3 at their outer skin. This improves toughness to mini- mize cracking, while maintaining a surface that has the mechanical and thermal properties to withstand the harsh die casting environ- ment. Injection molds can be built with low carbon steel as their base and P20 at their mold surface. The shell-like structure results in superior strength to soft tooling, while the low carbon steel base offers the advantages of being less expensive, easier and faster to machine, and having better thermal conductivity than harder tool steels. With DMD, plastic injection molds can utilize embedded copper- alloy inserts as heat sinks, increasing productivity by 20-30%. Faster extraction of heat allows parts to set-up faster and dramatically improves cycle times. Temperature distributions are simultaneously improved, leading to parts with less warpage and better dimensional tolerancing. The DMD process also offers the ability to deposit handbook grade, fully dense tool steels onto existing molds and dies. This allows obsolete (caused by model year changes) or damaged dies and molds to be reconfigured to new product designs, thereby sal- vaging obsolete investments and putting the tools back into active service. The cost savings and reduction in lead times that DMD can offer the marketplace is considerable. In fact, by depositing tool steel onto existing surfaces, the cost and time associated with pro- curing a new tool are completely eliminated. 2001-01-0976. A competitive advantage through innovation. G. C. McGrath, I. A. Jones, P. A. Hilton, E. J. C. Kellar, and A. Tay- lor, TWI; and R. Sallavanti, Gentex. The vast majority of products contain joints, therefore, joining technology is key to the strategic implementation of new materials. This paper considers three innovative solutions to industrial prob- lems ClearWeld™ - A recently developed technique for laser welding materials, creating a joint almost invisible to the human eye. AdhFAST™ - This novel, three-in-one fastener, allows adhesive to be injected through the middle of the device whilst retaining the joint and controlling bondline thickness Vitresyn™ - Transparent plastics such as polycarbonate and acrylic have the potential to replace glass in a number of applica- tions, car headlamps and spectacle lenses for example. However, these plastics are relatively soft materials and need protection against abrasion and scuff damage. This recently developed system gives good protection at acceptable cost. 2001-01-0977. Development of a fully automatic precision warm forging cell for the production of variable or constant ratio steering racks. Lyle J. McLean, Bishop Innovation Limited. This paper describes the development of a fully automatic Preci- sion Warm Forging Cell to produce Variable or Constant Ratio steering racks at a cycle time of 12 seconds. Racks are forged in a unique closed cavity multi-element forging die (Bishop Y-Forge Die) that uses a combination of mechanically and hydraulically loaded tooling elements to generate the required forming loads. The racks produced in this process are essentially free of flash and require no finish machining of the teeth or the rack faces (Y-faces) that contact the rack pad. Racks may have a specific "high point on 133</page><page sequence="133">2001-01-0977-2001-01-0984 center" or "rise/fall pattern," or both, and an accuracy of ± 0.01 0mm on center to ± 0.025mm at full lock is achieved. As-forged tooth mesh quality achieved is DIN Class 9 or better. The Cpk of all criti- cal rack forged dimensions exceeds 1.67. 2001-01-0978. A new tightening method for bolted joints by the simultaneous application of torque and compressive force. Kazuya Mori , Kumamoto Univ.; Shinji Haśhimura, Kurume National College of Technology; Yukitaka Murakami , Kyushu Univ.; and Kunihiko Mineki , Central Motor Wheel Co., Ltd. The scatter of bolt clamping force tightened by the conventional torque control method very often causes loosening and fatigue fail- ure of bolted joints. Different values of frictional coefficients between mating screw surfaces and between mating bearing sur- faces cause the scatter of clamping force in each tightening. In this study, a new tightening method to reduce the scatter of clamping force of bolted joints has been developed. In the new method, the frictional coefficients at screw and at bearing surface of bolt head can be separately detected during a tightening process by simultaneously application of tightening torque and compressive force to a bolt. The tightening experiments have been successfully conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed method. Furthermore the optimum configuration of bolt head to improve the accuracy of the proposed method has been investigated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0979. The development of lightweight self-piercing riveting equipment. S. A. Westgate, TWI Ltd.; R. Doo, Henrob Ltd.; F. Liebrecht and S. Braeunling, Technical University of Dres- den; T. Matts son, ABB Body-in-White (Olof ström) AB; and K.-O. Strömberg, Flexprop Production AB. Self-piercing riveting is an attractive joining technique in the automotive industry, particularly for materials which are difficult to resistance spot weld. The process is suited to robotic applications but because of the high setting forces required, conventional long reach guns would require excessive robot carrying capacity. A light- weight, long reach C-frame riveting gun has, therefore, been devel- oped. Together with associated equipment improvements, increased suitability of the self-piercing riveting process has been demon- strated for the volume production of automotive components and body assembly. 2001-01-0980. Thin-sheet austenite stainless steel pipe for automotive fuel filler pipe application. Katsuhiro Kajikawa, Tomonori Yamada, and Sakae Fukuta, HORIE METAL Co., Ltd. The automotive industry is exhibiting the trend of positively adopting stainless steel pipe as one of the means for improving weight reduction and rust resistance. In particular, austenite stain- less steel pipe (hereafter referred to as "SUS pipe") is widely used in automotive parts due to its excellent rust resistance, heat resis- tance, and magnetic properties. Nevertheless, reports regarding the forming technology of SUS pipe are rare. In particular, reports on the thin-sheet SUS pipe, which this paper discusses, are extremely rare. Up until now, the application of SUS pipe for various parts con- sisted primarily of l.Omm-thick materials. The thin-sheet SUS pipe material is known to be difficult to shape because of its low sheet rigidity relative to the forming force, resulting in wrinkles and buck- ling. Moreover, it is susceptible to galling in the die due to the hard- ness of the material, making it also difficult to shape. In this study, for the purpose of bending and expanding the thin- sheet SUS pipe material (with a maximum thickness of 0.5mm), we adopted the forming conditions in which the material characteristics of SUS pipe are taken into consideration. As a result, we were able to adopt an ultra-thin sheet SUS pipe material with a thickness of 0.5mm to automobile fuel filler pipe application. 2001-01-0981. Metal cutting chip breaking by lasers. Fengzhu (Frank) Li, Ford Motor Co.; and Jian Xie, Edison Welding Institute. In automated machining processes, long and continuous chips often cause machine down and hence increase process cost. Chip control or chip breaking methods are essential for unattended and automated systems such as CNC metal cutting machine or other fully automated metal cutting machines, especially for those which are integrated into production line. Conventional metal cutting chip control relies on the knowledge of chip flow angle, chip curl and breakage. In this paper, a new con- cept of metal cutting chip breaking using laser energy is presented and discussed. Preliminary laser chip breaking for copper, alumi- num and steel was investigated under static conditions by using a commercially available pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The results showed that the effectiveness of chip breaking by lasers varied dramatically at different levels of laser energy with or without assisted blow-off air. This study indicates that laser breaking of metal cutting chip is a potential technology for the chip control during machining. 2001-01-0982. Combining material characterization to com- puter modeling helps optimize a spindle system for machining shafts. Ben Chouchaoui, Windsor Industrial Development Labora- tory, Inc.; and Brian Wells and Zoran Jovanovic, Federal Mogul Tri-Way Ltd. To date, Federal Mogul Tri-Way Ltd. has relied on past experi- ence to design machinery, a system of belts or gears providing tor- sion and thrust to cutting tools. If a shaft within a spindle system is not properly sized, it can deflect under the action of the tangential cutting effort resulting in a poor finish of the machined component. Of even more importance, if rotation of the tool approaches a natural frequency of the shaft, deflections of the spindle under load amplify. In fact, Tri-Way has at instances replaced shafts during trials, caus- ing delays in delivering machinery. On the other hand, over- designing spindles cost money. A literature search by the Canadian Institute for System Technologies Information did not locate tools to help Tri-Way optimize spindles. The company has turned to Windsor Industrial Development Laboratory to develop and validate a computer model to simulate the static and dynamic behavior of spindle systems. This paper summarizes the findings of such research to date. 2001-01-0983. Platform robots: Gradation of mechanisms based on their structural error performance. V. V. N. R. Prasad Raju Pathapati, B. V. Raju Institute of Technology; and A. C. Rao, K. L. College of Engineering. Robot arms which received greater attention in the recent past are open chain linkages. Each joint in these robot arms is actuated inde- pendently. While possessing many advantages such as large work- space and maneuverability, they do suffer from disadvantages like less rigidity, accumulation of mechanical errors from shoulder to end effector, control problems, etc. The alternative to the open chain robot arms is the in-parallel actuator arrangement often referred to as the platform-type whose successful application is reported by many investigators. Multi-degree-of-freedom linkage mechanisms are now receiving active consideration for application as platform- type robots. In fact, in the literature, a number of distinct multi- degree-of-freedom planar linkage mechanisms are available and all of them can be considered as platform-type robots. In this paper, numerical measures are proposed to compare all the distinct planar linkage mechanism at the conceptual stage of design in the category of 9 link, 2 degree of freedom and 10 link, 3 degree of freedom, from the viewpoint of structural error performance. The proposed method is based on the deployment of design parameters in different topo- logical features of the chain viz., links, joints and loops. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-0984. (SP- 15 86) Electronic throttle control with con- tactless position sensor and smart power full-bridge. Andreas Pechlaner and Björn Steurich, Infineon Technologies. 134</page><page sequence="134">200 1 -0 1 -0984-200 1 -0 1 -0990 Electronic throttle systems are becoming more and more impor- tant in today's motor vehicles. These systems consist of: a throttle valve with an electrical actuator and a transmission; a position feed- back; an electronic acceleration pedal; an electronic control unit (ECU); a semiconductor h-bridge for driving the motor. The electronic acceleration pedal gives a set point to the ECU. A control signal is generated and moves the motor of the throttle valve with a semiconductor h-bridge to the requested position. The voltage drop of a potentiometer is used here as control feedback sig- nal. The potentiometer in the throttle valve is moved very often and has a rough environment like high temperature and vibrations. Therefore this system has a lot of problems with mechanical attrition and reliability during the whole system lifetime. The accuracy of the position control decreases over time. To avoid mechanical wear and tear, Infineon Technologies has developed a new concept for measuring the throttle position, based on a contactless sensor. The GMR-C6 is a giant magneto-resistive sensor which detects changes in the direction of a magnetic field. The present SAE paper will describe the construction of the sensor, the signal conditioning and the software algorithms. Moreover, a semiconductor h-bridge which has been specially developed for electronic throttle control will also be introduced. A complex logic circuit in the smart power device allows a very extensive diagnosis which is necessary to fulfill OBDII. Our vision for the future is a mechatronic solution for the throttle. That means all components are integrated into the throttle package. The control of the position is done internally. Only 4 wires are left: 2 for supply and 2 for communication. 2001-01-0985. (SP-1586) An improved anti-pulsation mass airflow sensor. Wolfgang Reuter and Karl-Heinrich Losing , Pier- burg AG; and John E. Golden, Pierburg Ine . To comply with increasingly stringent targets for emissions and fuel economy, more and more precise mass airflow sensor technol- ogy is required on both gasoline and diesel engines. On gasoline engines, the mass flow signal is used to more pre- cisely determine engine load. This, in turn, enables more precise fuel metering than can be achieved with traditional indirect load detec- tion methods. The lambda control variations are reduced signifi- cantly, and a more precise control of the mixture ratio can be achieved in cases where the lambda probe, i.e., the oxygen sensor, does not yet work perfectly. On diesel engines, the mass airflow sensor is used for the most precise automatic and independent control of EGR systems, includ- ing even the control of map dependent diesel injection pumps. Back- flow conditions on diesel engines with four or fewer cylinders, espe- cially in combination with EGR, render normal mass air flow meter sensing inadequate. This article presents a new type of very fast response Pierburg mass airflow sensor, which is capable of bi-directional flow sensing. The sensor is made by chip technology and has a microprocessor integrated in the hybrid electronics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0986. (SP-1586) Engine application of a battery volt- age-driven DI fuel injection system. Yutaka Kawamoto and Yori- hisa Tsuchiya, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; Makoto Yamakado, Hitachi, Ltd.; and Yasunaga Hamada, Hitachi Car Engineering, Ltd. Every fuel injection system for DI gasoline engines has a DC-DC converter to provide high, stabile voltage for opening the injector valve more quickly. A current control circuit for holding the valve open is also needed, as well as a large-capacity capacitor for pilot injection. Since these components occupy considerable space, an injector drive unit separate from the ECU must be used. Thus, there has been a need for a fuel injection system that can inject a small volume of fuel without requiring high voltage. To meet that need, we have developed a dual coil injector and an opening coil current control system. An investigation was also made of all the factors related to the dynamic range of the injector, including static flow rate, fuel pressure, battery voltage and harness resistance. Both efforts have led to the adoption of a battery voltage-driven fuel injector. 2001-01-0987. (SP-1586) The coaxial cavity resonator as a RF IC engine ignition source. Dustin L. Mclntyre, Gregory J. Thomp- son, and James E. Smith, West Virginia Univ. The Quarter Wave Coaxial Cavity Resonator (QWCCR) plasma igniter is designed, from previous theoretical work, as an ignition source for an internal combustion engine. The present research has explored the implementation of the QWCCR into an internal com- bustion (IC) engine. The QWCCR design parameters of inner con- ductor length, loop geometry, and loop position were varied for two igniters of differing operating frequency. Variations of the QWCCR radio frequency (RF) parameters, as a function of engine geometry, were studied by placing the igniter in a combustion chamber and manually varying the crank position. Three identical igniters were fitted with dielectric inserts and the parameters were studied before and after ignition was sustained in a twin-cylinder engine. Optimal resonator geometries were determined. Radio frequency parameter invariance was found with respect to crank angle and piston dis- tance. The first successful IC engine ignition using a QWCCR was achieved. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0988.

Masaki Iwaya, Kyohei Hayashi, Masaru Hayakawa, Takaaki Chosokabe, and Naoki Yamada, NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd. An exhaust gas temperature sensor, which can be used for con- trolling of new exhaust gas purification systems, was developed. The sensor can detect wide temperature range and has good response and reliability. To achieve wide temperature detection and good thermal durability, perovskite-type rare earth oxide was selected as a sensing element. The perovskite-type material func- tions as an insulator and also as a superconductor depending upon the combinations of metal ion. In this case, YCrOs was selected as a base material. By doping various metal ions into base material, wide range detection from 100 to 900°C and good thermal durability was obtained. To achieve good response and mechanical reliability simultaneously, metal sheathe cable with a small diameter was used in the structure of sensing portion. 2001-01-0989.

(SP-1586) Individual cylinder IMEP estima- tion using crankshaft angular velocity measurements. Jeremy Williams and Matthew C. Witter, Dynasim Research Ltd. This paper presents a method for identifying misfiring cylinders using crankshaft angular velocity measurements as input. The mea- sured angular velocity is used in conjunction with a system model to estimate the indicated torque developed by each cylinder. The method is valid for engines with overlapping firing pulses, and also under conditions in which there is large torsional deflection in the crankshaft. The method is suitable for implementation for on-board misfire diagnostics. Experimental validation is provided using a 19- liter, 6-cylinder diesel engine. The experimental data shows that accurate detection and identification of misfiring cylinders is possi- ble over the full speed and load range of the engine. 135</page><page sequence="135">2001-01-0991-2001-01-0997 2001-01-0991. (SP- 1586) High-accuracy low-cost cylinder pressure sensor for advanced engine controls. Otho Ulrich, Rap- heal Włodarczyk, and Marek T. Włodarczyk, Optrand Inc. A high-accuracy and low-cost cylinder pressure sensor reported in this paper compensates for all major temperature errors encoun- tered in internal combustion engines. The auto-referencing tech- nique maintains sensor calibration compensating for temperature effects on the sensor signal conditioner over the range of -40 to + 135°C. In an inexpensive design sensor head materials and dimen- sions are optimized to compensate for the mid-term thermal errors associated with engine load changes over a temperature range of -40 and 300°C, resulting in the thermal coefficient of sensitivity as low as 0.005 %/°C. A miniature, specially shaped diaphragm results in less than 0.5% error associated with rapidly changing combustion gas temperatures. Under non-combustion conditions the sensor offers +/-0.25 - 0.5% accuracy while under combustion conditions the accuracy is typically in the 1-2% range. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0992. (SP-1586) Employing an ionization sensor for combustion diagnostics in a lean-burn natural gas engine. Axel Franke, Patrik Einewall, and Bengt Johansson, Lund Institute of Technology; and Raymond Reinmann, Saab Automobile AB. An ionization sensor has been used to study the combustion pro- cess in a six-cylinder lean-burn, truck-sized engine fueled with natu- ral gas and optimized for low emissions of nitric oxides. The final goal of the investigations is to study the prospects of using the ion- ization sensor for finding the optimal operating position with respect to low NOx emissions and stable engine operation. The results indicate that unstable combustion can be detected by analyzing the coefficient of variation (CoV) of the detector current amplitude. Close relationships between this measure and the CoV of the indicated mean effective pressure have been found during an air-fuel ratio scan with fixed ignition advance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0993.

A misfire detection study on a prechamber-equipped spark igni- tion gas combustion engine is presented. The study shows that the logarithm on the absolute-valued ion current can be linearly weighted in order to detect misfire over a broad load range with only one threshold. Results also show that a very low complexity misfire detector can achieve good performance when a linear weighting technique is applied to the squared rotational speed samples. The detection performance based on the combination of rotational speed and ionization measurements is also presented. 2001-01-0994. (SP-1586) Combustion monitoring by use of the spark plug for DI engine. Noriaki Kondo, Takahiro Suzuki, Yasushi Sakakura, and Tatsunori Yamada, NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd. To meet the recent emission standard and fuel economy, it is required to scale down engine component sizes. For the ignition sys- tem, we would like to reduce the physical size of an ignition coil as well. However the present direct-ignition (DI) engine requires long spark duration time, and which makes difficult to reduce the physical size of the ignition coil. NTK developed a special method to achieve the goal. The presented paper introduces size reduction of the ignition coil and shortening the spark duration time for good ignition perfor- mance with the carbon fouling detection capability. Occurrence of the carbon fouling accompanies abnormal spark around the spark nose area always. Accordingly, this paper describes also a method detecting the abnormal spark, by using discharge current method or spark plug voltage. Furthermore, this paper describes the method of early detection of misfire and evasive control by detecting the abnormal spark. On the other hand, it is necessary for the SI engine to accurately detect the combustion condition of an engine in real time in order to maintain high efficiency and low emission. To mon- itor the information, the presented paper discusses the method of detecting the combustion condition by detecting ions generated from combustion, with aid of electrodes of the spark plug. The paper also describes how the miniaturization of ignition coil mentioned above is useful to detect combustion condition by using the ion cur- rent method. 2001-01-0995. (SP-1585) Engine control using torque estima- tion. Byungho Lee, Giorgio Rizzoni, Yann Guezennec, and Ahmed Soliman, Ohio State Univ.; Mauro Cavalletti, University of Perugia; and James Waters, Delphi Automotive Systems. In recent years, the increasing interest and requirements for improved engine diagnostics and control has led to the implementa- tion of several different sensing and signal processing technologies. In order to optimize the performance and emission of an engine, detailed and specified knowledge of the combustion process inside the engine cylinder is required. In that sense, the torque generated by each combustion event in an IC engine is one of the most impor- tant variables related to the combustion process and engine perfor- mance. This paper introduces torque estimation techniques in the real- time basis for engine control applications using the measurement of crankshaft speed variation. The torque estimation scheme presented in this paper consists of two entirely different approaches, "Stochas- tic Analysis" and "Frequency Analysis." The background as well as technical implementations of these approaches is presented in this paper, along with extensive results obtained from a four-cylinder S.I. engine while varying the engine speed and load. Both approaches are analyzed and compared in the sense of estimation accuracy and computational requirements, and feasibility for the real-time engine control application. Results show that both meth- ods allow to estimate the indicated torque based on the crankshaft speed measurement while providing not only accurate but also rela- tively fast estimations during the computation processes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0996. (SP- 1604) Swirl-spray interactions in a diesel engine. M. E. McCracken and J. Abraham, Purdue Univ. Swirl in diesel engines is known to be an important parameter that affects the mixing of the fuel jets, heat release, emissions, and overall engine performance. The changes may be brought about through interactions of the swirling flow field with the spray and through modifications of the flow field. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the interaction of the swirl with sprays in a diesel engine through a computational study. A multi-dimensional model for flows, sprays, and combustion in engines is employed. Results from computations are reported with varying levels of swirl and ini- tial turbulence in two typical diesel engine geometries. It is shown that there is an optimal level of swirl for each geometry that results from a balance between increased jet surface area and, hence, mix- ing rates and utilization of air in the chamber. Results are also reported for several split injection strategies to assess whether the interactions observed with a single injection event are applicable. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0997. (SP- 1604) Oil non-equilibrium turbulence cor- rections in multidimensional HSDI diesel engine computations. G. M. Bianchi and P. Pelloni, University of Bologna; and G.-S. Zhu and R. Reitz , University of Wisconsin. The introduction of high-pressure injection systems in D.I. diesel engines has highlighted already known drawbacks of in-cylinder turbulence modeling. In particular, the well known equilibrium hypothesis is far from being valid even during the compression stroke and moreover during the spray injection and combustion pro- cesses when turbulence energy transfer between scales occurs under non-equilibrium conditions. The present paper focuses on modeling 136</page><page sequence="136">2001-01-0997-2001-01-1005 in-cylinder engine turbulent flows. Turbulence is accounted for by using the RNG k-e model which is based on equilibrium turbulence assumptions. By using a modified version of the Kiva-3 code, different mathe- matically based corrections to the computed macro length scale are proposed in order to account for non-equilibrium effects. These new approaches are applied to a simulation of a recent generation HSDI Diesel engine at both full load and partial load conditions represen- tative of the emission EUDC cycle. The numerical results show that the proposed corrections improve the physical behavior of the combustion model by a self- scaling of the eddy-turnover time depending on the engine operating conditions. The overall achievement is the extension of modeling reliability over a wider range of operating conditions and in particu- lar over those that are of interest in the European emission test cycle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-0998. (SP- 1604) High-pressure spray and combus- tion modeling using continuous thermodynamics for diesel fuels. Yong Yi, Guang-Sheng Zhu, and Rolf D. Reitz, University of Wiscon- sin. Practical diesel fuel sprays under high-pressure conditions were investigated by using multidimensional modeling combined with continuous thermodynamics and high-pressure multicomponent fuel vaporization models. Transport equations, which are general for the moments of the distributions and independent of the distribution function, are derived for the continuous system consisting of the both gas and liquid phases. A general treatment of the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) is conducted, and the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (EOS) is used to find the surface equilibrium composition. Relations for the properties of the continuous species are formu- lated. The KH-RT model is used for spray breakup prediction. The fuel droplets are assumed to be well mixed with uniform tempera- ture and composition within each droplet. The turbulent flow field is calculated using the RNG k-£ turbulence model. The model predicts liquid lengths in vaporizing sprays that com- pare favorably with available experimental data. The model was also applied to practical engine simulations. The ignition model is a modified Shell model that accounts for multicomponent fuel effects on the Cetane number. Combustion is modeled with a lami- nar-turbulent characteristic time combustion model. Numerical results for No. 2 diesel fuel are presented with comparison to low- pressure model predictions. The results clarify the characteristics of engine fuel sprays and indicate that it is important to consider high- pressure multicomponent fuel vaporization effects in engine calculations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1001. (SP- 1604) Simulating the combustion in a DI diesel engine applying a new model for the conditional scalar dissipation rate. Carl Hergart, Ford Research Center Aachen; and Norbert Peters , RWTH Aachen. The Representative Interactive Flamelet (RIF) model offers a method of separating the numerical effort associated with solving the governing equations for the turbulent flow field from that of the chemistry. This is possible since the chemical time scales can be considered very small compared to those related to the turbulence. The concept has gained widespread recognition owing to its ability of capturing the essential physics underlying combustion. The objective of this paper is to show how a more accurate description of mainly the soot formation and oxidation processes in a high- speed small-bore Direct Injection (DI) diesel engine can be realized within the framework of the RIF model. This is achieved by deriving a new model for the conditional scalar dissipation rate, describing the transport in the flamelet. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1003. (SP- 1604) The role of radical species in diesel engine auto-ignition detection. F. E. Cordone, M. Costa, and B. M. Vaglieco, Istituto Motori - CNR; and A. De Maio, Università di Roma uTor-Vergata'' Ignition delay in diesel engine combustion comprehends both a chemical and a physical amount, the first depending on fuel compo- sition and charge temperature and pressure, the last resulting of time needed for the fuel to atomize, vaporize and mix with air. Control of this parameter, which is mandatory to weight the relative amount of premixed to diffusive stage of the hydrocarbon combustion, is here considered. Experimental measurements of flame intensity spectra obtained by in situ measurements on an optically accessible test device show the presence of peaks corresponding to radicals as OH and CH appearing at the pressure start of combustion. Since OH radicals result from chain branching reactions, a numerical simulation is per- formed based on a reduced kinetic scheme which allows to measure the branching agent concentration, and whose approximate nature is adequate to the proportion chemical aspects contribute to the overall delay. By changing the engine operating conditions, ignition delay is shown to exhibit a trend characterized by a negative temperature coefficient. A good agreement is found between the location of a maximum in the computed rate of formation of the reaction cycle branching agent and that of a maximum of the measured emission intensity of early formed radicals. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1004. (SP- 1604) Modeling the effects of EGR and injection pressure on emissions in a high-speed direct-injection diesel engine. K. J. Richards, M. N. Subramaniam, and R. D. Reitz , University of Wisconsin; M.-C. Lai and N. A. Henein, Wayne State Univ.; and P. C. Miles, Sandia National Laboratories. Experimental data is used in conjunction with multi-dimensional modeling in a modified version of the KIVA-3V code to character- ize the emissions behavior of a high-speed, direct-injection diesel engine. Injection pressure and EGR are varied across a range of typi- cal small-bore diesel operating conditions and the resulting soot-NOx tradeoff is analyzed. Good agreement is obtained between experimental and modeling trends; the HSDI engine shows increas- ing soot and decreasing NOx with higher EGR and lower injection pressure. The model also indicates that most of the NOx is formed in the region where the bulk of the initial heat release first takes place, both for zero and high EGR cases. The mechanism of NOx reduction with high EGR is shown to be primarily through a decrease in thermal NOx formation rate. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1005. (SP- 1604) A mixture fraction averaged approach to modeling NO and soot in diesel engines. Amrita R. Wadhwa, Venkatesh Gopalakrishnan, and John Abraham, Purdue Univ. Multidimensional models are increasingly employed to predict NO and soot emissions from diesel engines. In the traditional approach, the ensemble- averaged values of variables are employed in the expressions for NO and soot formation and oxidation. In the mixture fraction averaged approach, the values of state variables and species concentrations are obtained from the structure of laminar diffusion flames. The source terms for NO and soot are then obtained by averaging across the mixture fraction coordinate with a probability density function. The clipped-Gaussian probability density function and profiles obtained by employing the OPPDIF code (part of the CHEMKIN package) for the laminar flame struc- ture are employed in this work. The Zeldovich mechanism for NO formation and the Moss et al., formation and Nagle-Strickland- Constable oxidation model for soot have been employed to study the qualitative trends of pollutants in transient combusting diesel jets. Computations are carried out in an axisymmetric constant volume chamber to evaluate the approach. It is shown that the computed NO 137</page><page sequence="137">2001-01-1005-2001-01-1011 and soot behavior and the jet flowfield structure are consistent with experimental findings. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1006. (SP- 1606) A mathematical model for exhaust system vibrations caused by road surface inputs. Ali G. Goktan, Istanbul Technical Univ.; and Argun Yetkin, Tenneco Automotive. A mathematical model has been developed for the investigation of mechanical vibrations of an exhaust system under road load exci- tation. For practical reasons, the vehicle body and the exhaust sys- tem has been considered as masses connected by springs and damp- ers. Non-linear damping characteristics of the vehicle tires and the exhaust isolators have been included in the model. Equations of motion have been solved in the MatLab environment, and transfer functions of the system and response to input signals representing the power spectrum density (PSD) of the road profile have been obtained for each mass in the system. The model developed has been verified through comparisons to the acceleration time history recordings on a proving ground and has been used for the parametric studies. The paper describes a comparison of model results with experi- mental observations, and predictions of parametric studies. 2001-01-1007. (SP- 1606) Quantifying relationships between the crankshaft's speed variation and the gas pressure torque. Dinu Taraza , Wayne State Univ. The non-uniform character of the torque produced by a recipro- cating I.C. engine is reflected in the cyclic variation of the crank- shaft's speed. Because the crankshaft is an elastic structure, its response to the different harmonic components of the torque is dif- ferent and changes with engine speed. The lowest harmonic compo- nents of the engine torque do not excite torsional vibrations and cor- relate fairly well with the corresponding harmonic orders of the crankshaft's speed. Based on a random vector model of the har- monic components of the gas-pressure torque, a statistical correla- tion is obtained between amplitudes and phases of the same har- monic component of the gas-pressure torque and of the crankshaft's speed. The lowest major harmonic order determines the average IMEP of the engine and the half-order detects if a cylinder is a lesser contributor to the total engine output and identifies the deficient cyl- inder. Experimental investigation of a six-cylinder automotive die- sel engine validates the numerical correlations. 2001-01-1008. (SP-1606) Development of crankshaft configu- ration design. Takahiro Fujimoto, Miyuki Yamamoto, Kazuo Oka- mura, and Yasuo Hida, Sumitomo Metal Industries Co., Ltd. Weight reduction of the crankshaft has been required to lighten the automobile engine. However, makeshift measures for such reduction often cause the increase of bearing load, and bring about more vibration/noise. This paper presents a method to calculate bearing load with con- sideration of flexibility of crankshaft, the vibration of engine, and the method to optimize the configuration of crankshaft on the basis on the above-mentioned calculation. The paper shows that these methods can be used to design a crankshaft configuration that can reduce both bearing load and weight of an in-line four-cylinder-engine crankshaft. 2001-01-1009. (SP-1606) A numerical contribution to the improvement of individual cylinder AFR control in a 4 cylinder S.I. engine. F. Millo and C. V. Ferraro, Politecnico di Torino; and L. Pilo, FIAT Auto S.p.A. Numerical simulation can be effectively used to reduce the experimental tests which are nowadays required for the analysis and calibration of engine control systems. In particular in this paper the use of a one-dimensional engine model to analyze the response of an UEGO sensor in the exhaust manifold of a 4 cylinder S.I. engine (with multipoint fuel injection) is described: numerical simulation has been used to simulate a misfunction of the fuelling system, which caused one of the four cylinders to be fuelled with an air/fuel ratio that was 10% richer than the others. The simulated UEGO response was then compared with experimental measurements, and after this validation process, the sensor model can be used to study a proper fuel injection control strategy thus reducing the required experimental tests, as outlined in a test case presented at the end of the paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1010. (SP-1606) Validation of a cyclic NO formation model with fast NO measurements. Jeffrey K. Ball and Martin J. Bowe, U S AF Academy; C. Richard Stone, University of Oxford; and Nick Collings, University of Cambridge. Experimental data was obtained from a Rover K4 optical access engine and analyzed with a combustion analysis package. Cyclic NO values were calculated by mass averaging the measurements obtained by a fast NO analyzer. While the mass-averaged results were used as the basis of comparison for the model, results indicate that mass averaging a fast NO signal is not nearly as critical as mass averaging a fast FID signal. A computer simulation (ISIS - Inte- grated Spark Ignition engine Simulation) was used to model the NO formation on a cyclic basis by means of the extended Zeldovich equations. The model achieves its cyclic variability through the input of experimentally derived burn rates and a completeness of combustion parameter, which is based on the Rassweiler and Withrow method of calculating mass fraction burned and is derived from the pressure-crank angle record of the engine. The cycle-by- cycle NO modeling results are found to compare well with the experiments in terms of the mean value for all cycles, the general slope of the NO versus Pmax line, and the maximum and minimum values (or spread). The modeled results do not, however, exhibit the same degree of scatter as the experimental data. This is attributed to the model utilizing a constant temperature at inlet valve closure and constant residual mass fraction for all cycles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1011. (SP-1606) Modeling NO formation in spark ignition engines with a layered adiabatic core and combustion inefficiency routine. Matt Rublewski and John B. Heywood, Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology. A thermodynamic-based cycle simulation which uses a thermal boundary layer, either, a fully mixed or layered adiabatic core, and a crevice combustion inefficiency routine has been used to explore the sensitivity of NO concentration predictions to critical physical modeling assumptions. An experimental database, which included measurements of residual gas fraction, was obtained from a 2.0-liter Nissan engine while firing on propane. A model calibration method- ology was developed to ensure accurate predictions of in-cylinder pressure and burned gas temperature. Comparisons with experimen- tal NO data then showed that accounting for temperature stratifica- tion during combustion with a layered adiabatic core and including a crevice/combustion inefficiency routine, improved the match of modeling predictions to data, in comparison to a fully mixed adia- batic core. With the layered routine, it was concluded that the simple three reaction Zeldovich mechanism, alone, was capable of predict- ing NO concentration, as a function of spark timing, equivalence ratio, and intake manifold pressure, to better than 15% accuracy. Following the comparison with experimental data, a parametric sen- sitivity analysis was performed which showed NO predictions to be relatively insensitive to changes in overall heat loss and size of the crevice volume used to model combustion inefficiency. The sensi- tivity analysis is also confirmed that residual fraction and burn rate are the most critical engine variables for making NO predictions. Finally, a set of kinetic calculations was performed that showed model accuracy could be modestly improved by removing the equi- librium burned gas radical pool assumption. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 138</page><page sequence="138">2001-01-1012-2001-01-1019 2001-01-1012. (SP- 1606) Knock prediction in reciprocating gas-engines using detailed chemical kinetics. I. Yavuz and I. Celik, West Virginia Univ.; and M. H. McMillian , National Energy Tech- nology Laboratory. Two- and three-dimensional test cases were simulated using a detailed kinetic mechanism for di-methyl ether to represent methane combustion. A piston-bowl assembly for the compression and expansion strokes with combustion has been simulated at 1500 RPM. A fine grid was used for the 2-D simulations and a rather coarse grid was used for the 3-D calculations together with a k-e subgrid-scale turbulence model and a partially stirred reactor model with three time scales. Ignition was simulated artificially by increas- ing the temperature at one point inside the cylinder. The results of these simulations were compared with experimental results. The simulation involved an engine with a homogeneous charge of meth- ane as fuel. Results indicate that pressure fluctuations were captured some time after the ignition started, which indicates knock condi- tions. Detailed analysis of the pressure data showed that knock was present in the simulations and exhibited similar characteristics to the ones observed in experiments. The pressure oscillation frequency was around 5-14 kHz for the simulations, which is well within the in-cy linder pressure oscillation frequency range ~3-25 kHz captured during knock via measurements. The oscillations lasted for ~20° CA which was also experimental observed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1013. Sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of heat exchanger designs. Alaa E. El-Sharkawy , Modern Engineering Inc. This paper addresses the uncertainties in heat exchanger design and their effect on the expected heat exchanger performance. Based on the work presented in this paper, it will be possible to determine the confidence level that a heat exchanger will meet its design goals, considering the uncertainties in its design parameters. It will also be possible to determine the most influential design parameters. In gen- eral, nominal or mean values of design parameters are used in design or rating calculations without consideration to the uncertainties inherent in them. Therefore, an estimate of the overall design uncer- tainty should be evaluated. Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) is used to determine the overall design uncertainty, and evaluate design sensitivity to each of the design parameters. The probability or confidence level that a heat exchanger can meet a cer- tain design target can be determined. Therefore, it will be possible to determine the additional heat transfer area that is required to achieve a desired performance. 2001-01-1014. (SP- 16 13) Thermal modeling of engine compo- nents for temperature prediction and fluid flow regulation. J. R. Wagner , E. E. Marotta, and I. Paradis, Clemson Univ. The operation of internal combustion engines depend on the suc- cessful management of the fuel, spark, and cooling processes to ensure acceptable performance, emission levels, and fuel economy. Two different thermal management systems exist for engines - air and liquid cooling. Smaller displacement utility and spark-ignition aircraft engines typically feature air-cooled systems which rely on forced convection over the exterior engine surfaces. In contrast, pas- senger/light-duty engines use a water-ethylene glycol mixture which circulates through the radiator, water pump, and heater core. The regulation of the overall engine temperature, based on the coolant's temperature, has been achieved with the thermostat valve and (elec- tric) radiator fan. To provide insight into the thermal behavior of the cylinder-head assembly for enhanced cooling system operation, a dynamic model must exist. In this paper, two multi-node thermal models will be presented to estimate the temperature of the in- cylinder and cylinder head components for air and liquid cooled engines. A lumped parameter approach has been pursued using both analytical and empirical relationships. To determined the appropri- ate number of thermal nodes and dominant heat transfer mecha- nisms (e.g., conduction, convection, radiation) between each node, thermal engine analyses have been performed. Representative numerical results will be presented and discussed for several operat- ing cycles to demonstrate the performance of the dynamic model in predicting internal engine temperatures. To validate the thermal model, experimental testing has been conducted and temperatures logged at various engine locations. The paper will conclude with a discussion of mechatronic strategies to increase the engine's thermal efficiency while maintaining acceptable temperature limits for components. 2001-01-1015. (SP- 161 3) Airflow parameters near the differ- ential of a rear drive passenger car. Sergei Mardiyants and Simon Watkins, RMIT Univ. The paper presents experimental analysis of the airflow around the differential center housing of a rear-drive full-scale passenger car. The study included investigation of local airflow total and static pressure, as well as surface flow visualization. Estimation of the local airflow velocity is based on the measured pressure coeffi- cients. The experiments were carried out at different test facilities: in a climatic wind tunnel, in a full-scale wind tunnel and on-road. Influence of side wind was modeled by the yawing of the car in the full-scale wind tunnel. The results show the asymmetrical structure of the flow in both, vertical and horizontal planes. Estimated longitudinal relative local velocity decreases from maximum Vr is equivalent to 0.4 at the lower surface of the center housing, to about Vr is equivalent to 0 above the upper surface. Side wind increases airflow velocity around the center housing within the investigated yaw range ± 20°. 2001-01-1017. (SP-1613) Thermal analysis of electric motors in engine cooling fan systems. T.

(SP-1613) Development of a cooling module containing a radiator and a condenser - Part 1: Product design. Satomi Muto, Tatsuo Sugimoto, Akira Utikawa, and Michiyasu Yamamoto, Denso Corp. In conventional automobile designs, a radiator for cooling the engine and a condenser for condensing the air-conditioner refriger- ant are typically configured independently of each other; they are usually mounted in series in the front of the engine compartment so that they will receive sufficient air flow while the vehicle is running. We have developed a smaller and higher performance cooling mod- ule by integrating these two heat exchangers into one unit. For the heat dissipation fin, we have employed an integral fin construction equipped with an insulating slit, resulting in effective prevention of thermal conduction from the higher temperature radia- tor side, to the condenser side. We also succeeded in improving heat dissipation performance by making effective use of the connection part of the integral fin. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1019.

(SP-1613) Exhaust heat recovery system for modern cars. Peter Diehl , Visteon Deutschland GmbH; and Frank Haubner, Stefan Klopstein, and Franz Koch, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. The fuel consumption and the emissions of modern passenger cars are highly affected by the fluid and material temperatures of the engine. Unfortunately, the high thermal efficiencies of Direct Injec- tion (DI) Diesel and Spark Ignition (SI) engines cause in many driv- ing situations low heat transfer to the engine components and espe- cially to the oil and the coolant. In these conditions the normal oper- ating temperatures are not achieved. Especially at low ambient tem- peratures and low engine loads the requirement of a comfortable cabin heating and a fast warm-up of engine oil and coolant cannot be satisfied simultaneously. To reach the required warm-up performance, an Exhaust Heat Recovery System (EHRS) will be demonstrated. Further design and optimization processes for modern cooling systems in fuel-efficient engines require numerical and experimen- tal investigations of supplemental heater systems to meet all require- ments under all circumstances. According to the car manufacturers' definition of thermal objectives for the engine and for the passenger cabin any heat generated or recovered can be distributed to the cus- tomers' needs. Modeling the fluid flows (oil, coolant) and material surface tem- peratures is a prerequisite tool to analyze the heat fluxes to the vari- ous components inside an engine. The coolant temperatures at the engine outlet can then be determined by using an energy balance. The maximum potential to improve fuel efficiency is demonstrated based on a cycle simulation of a typical SI engine. The EHRS system is described with special attention paid to the cabin heating of passenger cars with modern DI-Diesel engines. The available heat in the exhaust gas behind the catalyst is sufficient to support the warm-up adequately for most of the ambient conditions at no fuel consumption penalty. For very cold temperatures of -18°C (0°F) sufficient additional energy can be generated and recovered by throttling the exhaust flow additionally. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1021. (SP-1613) Towards optimization of automotive waste heat recovery using thermoelectrics. Douglas Crane , Greg- ory Jackson , and David Holloway , University of Maryland. The potential for thermoelectric power generation via waste heat recovery onboard automobiles to displace alternators and/or provide additional charging to a hybrid vehicle battery pack has increased with recent advances in thermoelectric materials processing. A pre- liminary design/modeling study was performed to optimize waste heat recovery for power generation using a modified radiator incor- porating thermoelectric modules. The optimization incorporates not only thermoelectric performance but also critical systems issues such as accessory power consumption, vehicle drag, and added sys- tem weight. Results indicate the effectiveness of the thermoelectric module is extremely sensitive to ambient heat rejection and to the operating temperature range of the thermoelectric device. The study also details how radiator modifications can be made with minimal overall system performance penalties and what is the minimal ther- moelectric performance necessary for the proposed integrated TE radiator to provide adequate power for displacing current day alter- nators. From the results, conclusions are drawn about the viability of the concept for integration into a passenger vehicle. 2001-01-1022. (SP-1613) OCP- Materials.

(SP- 1623) Modeling of the effect of air/fuel ratio and temperature distribution on HCCI engines. Toshiji Amano, Satoshi Morimoto, and Yasuharu Kawabata, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. A computer model has been developed to investigate the effect of temperature and air/fuel ratio inhomogeneity on HCCI combus- tion. Engine tests were performed to aid the model validation. After obtaining appropriate agreement between experimental pressure profiles and the computer simulation, it was found that two very important factors impact the pressure profiles; (1) the onset timing of the overall reaction, which is mainly governed by the highest tem- perature in the cylinder, and (2) the time lag between initial ignition and combustion in other regions, resulting from temperature and species inhomogeneity. 2001-01-1025. (SP-1623) Prediction of pre-ignition reactivity and ignition delay for HCCI using a reduced chemical kinetic model. Jincai Zheng, Weiying Yang, David L. Miller, and Nicholas P. Cernansky, Drexel Univ. Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines have the possibility of low NOx and particulate emissions and high fuel efficiencies. In HCCI the oxidation chemistry determines the auto-ignition timing, the heat release rate, the reaction intermedi- ates, and the ultimate products of combustion. This paper reports an initial effort to apply our reduced chemical kinetic model to HCCI processes. The model was developed to study the pre-ignition char- acteristics (pre-ignition heat release and start of ignition) of primary reference fuels (PRF) and includes 29 reactions and 20 active spe- cies. The only modifications to the model were to make the pro- scribed adjustments to the fuel specific rate constants, and to enhance the H2O2 decomposition rate to agree with published data. Simulations were compared with measured and calculated data from our engine operating at the following conditions: speed - 750 RPM, inlet temperature - 393 K to 453 K, fuels - 20 PRF, 50 PRF and 20 PRF with alkenes and aromatics, and equivalence ratio - 0.4 and 0.5. The simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data including temperature, pressure, ignition delay, and preignition heat release. This demonstrates the model has potential for use in predict- ing the behavior of HCCI engines. From both the experiments and the reduced kinetic model, the results show that for 20 PRF the first- stage ignition begins at 707 K, the second-stage ignition temperature is 910-924 K, and significant reaction occurs during the preignition process resulting in pre- ignition heat release of about 7%-10% of the potential heat release. The second-stage ignition time varies with inlet temperature, equivalence ratio, engine load and octane number. When the engine is run with a volumetric efficiency of 71% at 750 RPM, inlet temperature 423 K, equivalence ratio 0.4 and 20 PRF, the duration from the first to second-stage ignition is 25 CAD. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1026.

The results show that good levels of agreement were obtained using the present KIVA/ CHEMKIN model for a wide range of engine conditions, including various fuels, injection systems, engine speeds, and EGR levels. Ignition timings were predicted well without the need to adjust any kinetic constants. However, it was found that the use of chemical kinetics alone was not sufficient to accurately simulate the overall combustion rate. The effects of turbulent mixing on the reaction rates needed to be considered to correctly simulate the combustion phasing. It was also found that the presence of residual radicals could enhance the mixture reactivity and hence shorten the ignition delay time. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1027. (SP- 1623) A sequential fluid-mechanic chemi- cal-kinetic model of propane HCCI combustion. Salvador M. Aceves, Daniel L. Flowers , Joel Martinez- F rias, J . Ray Smith, Charles K. Westbrook, and William J. Pitz , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Robert Dibble, University of California Berkeley; John F. Wright and Wole C. Akinyemi, Cummins Engine Co.; and Randy P. Hessel, University of Wisconsin. We have developed a methodology for predicting combustion and emissions in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine. This methodology combines a detailed fluid mechanics code with a detailed chemical kinetics code. Instead of directly linking the two codes, which would require an extremely long computational time, the methodology consists of first running the fluid mechanics code to obtain temperature profiles as a function of time. These temperature profiles are then used as input to a multi- zone chemical kinetics code. The advantage of this procedure is that a small number of zones (10) is enough to obtain accurate results. This procedure achieves the benefits of linking the fluid mechanics and the chemical kinetics codes with a great reduction in the compu- tational effort, to a level that can be handled with current computers. The success of this procedure is in large part a consequence of the fact that for much of the compression stroke the chemistry is inac- tive and thus has little influence on fluid mechanics and heat trans- fer. Then, when chemistry is active, combustion is rather sudden, leaving little time for interaction between chemistry and fluid mix- ing and heat transfer. This sequential methodology has been capable of explaining the main characteristics of HCCI combustion that have been observed in experiments. In this paper, we use our model to explore an HCCI engine run- ning on propane. The paper compares experimental and numerical pressure traces, heat release rates, and hydrocarbon and carbon mon- oxide emissions. The results show an excellent agreement, even in parameters that are difficult to predict, such as chemical heat release rates. Carbon monoxide emissions are reasonably well predicted, even though it is intrinsically difficult to make good predictions of CO emissions in HCCI engines. The paper includes a sensitivity study on the effect of the heat transfer correlation on the results of the analysis. Importantly, the paper also shows a numerical study on how parameters such as swirl rate, crevices and ceramic walls could help in reducing HC and CO emissions from HCCI engines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1028. (SP- 1623) Development of a two-zone HCCI combustion model accounting for boundary layer effects. Scott B. Fiveland and Dennis N. Assanis, University of Michigan. The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) com- bustion concept is currently under widespread investigation due to its potential to increase thermal efficiency while greatly decreasing harmful exhaust pollutants. Simulation tools have been developed to explore the implications of initial mixture thermodynamic state on engine performance and emissions. In most cases these modeling efforts have coupled a detailed fuel chemistry mechanism with empirical descriptions of the in-cylinder heat transfer processes. The primary objective of this paper is to present a fundamentally based boundary layer heat transfer model. The two-zone combustion model couples an adiabatic core zone with a boundary layer heat transfer model. The model predicts film coefficient, with approxi- mately the same universal shape and magnitudes as an existing global model. In addition, the new model resolves the boundary layer thickness and mass fraction trapped in the boundary layer, which are needed to predict and understand hydrocarbon quench. The two-zone model is then validated against experimental data and compared to the single-zone formulation, which utilizes empirical heat transfer treatments. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1029. (SP- 1623) Modeling of HCCI combustion and emissions using detailed chemistry. William L. Easley, Apoorva Agarwal, and George A. Lavoie, Ford Motor Co. To help guide the design of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines, single- and multi-zone models of the con- cept are developed by coupling the first law of thermodynamics with detailed chemistry of hydrocarbon fuel oxidation and NOx forma- tion. These models are used in parametric studies to determine the effect of heat loss, crevice volume, temperature stratification, fuel- air equivalence ratio, engine speed, and boosting on HCCI engine operation. In the single-zone model, the cylinder is assumed to be adiabatic and its contents homogeneous. Start of combustion and bottom dead center temperatures required for ignition to occur at top dead center are reported for methane, n-heptane, isooctane, and a mixture of 87% isooctane and 13% n-heptane by volume (simulated gasoline) for a variety of operating conditions. Detailed chemistry of NOx for- mation is coupled with multi-step chemical kinetics of hydrocarbon fuel oxidation to gain insight into the ignition and NOx formation processes. A more detailed multi-zone model is also developed in an effort to explore the effects of temperature stratification, heat loss, and crevice volume on the combustion process and HC, CO, and NOx emissions. The combustion chamber volume is divided into four types of zones: crevice, boundary layer, inner core, and outer core. The inner core zones are considered to be adiabatic and constant mass, while the outer core, boundary layer, and crevice zones are allowed to exchange mass and energy. The multi-zone model is used to conduct parametric studies to investigate the effect of changing engine operating conditions, crevice volume, and boundary layer thickness on engine performance and emissions. It is shown that CO emissions primarily arise from fuel flowing out of the crevices and boundary layer during expansion and being partially oxidized. The multi-zone model is hence shown to provide a much more physical representation of the ignition and emission formation processes in HCCI engines than the single-zone model. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1030. (SP- 1623) Experimental studies on Controlled Auto-ignition (CAI) combustion of gasoline in a 4-stroke engine. Aaron Oakley , Hua Zhao, and Nicos Ladommatos, Brunei Univ.; and Tom Ma, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents results from an experimental program researching the in-cylinder conditions necessary to obtain gasoline Controlled Auto-ignition (CAI) combustion in a 4-stroke engine. A single-cylinder, variable compression ratio research engine is used for all experiments. Investigations concentrate on establishing the CAI operating range with regard to Air/Fuel ratio and Exhaust Gas Re-circulation (EGR) and their effect on ignition timing, combus- tion rate and variability, ISFC, and engine-out emissions, such as NOx, CO, and unburned HC. Comprehensive maps for each of the measured variables are presented and in relevant cases, these results are compared to those obtained during normal spark-ignition opera- 141</page><page sequence="141">2001-01-1030-2001-01-1038 tion so that the benefits of CAI combustion can be more fully appreciated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1031. (SP- 1623) Closed-loop control of an HCCI engine. Jan-Ola Olsson, Per Tunestâl, and Bengt Johansson , Lund Institute of Technology. This paper presents a strategy for closed-loop control of a multi- cylinder turbocharged Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine. A dual fuel port injection system allows control of combustion timing and load individually for each cylinder. The two fuels used are isooctane and n-heptane, which provides a wide range of autoignition properties. Cylinder pressure sensors provide feedback and information regarding combustion. The angle of 50% heat release is calculated in real time for each cycle and used for timing feedback. Inlet air preheating is used at low loads to maintain a high com- bustion efficiency. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1032. (SP- 1623) Reacting boundary layers in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) egine. Anders Hultqvist, SCANIA CV AB; and UlfEngdar , Bengt Johans- son, and Jens Klingmann, Lund Institute of Technology. An experimental and computational study of the near-wall com- bustion in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine has been conducted by applying laser-based diagnostic tech- niques in combination with numerical modeling. Our major intent was to characterize the combustion in the velocity- and thermal boundary layers. The progress of the combustion was studied by using fuel tracer LIF, the result of which was compared with LDA measurements of the velocity boundary layer along with numerical simulations of the reacting boundary layer. Time-resolved images of the PLIF signal were taken and ensem- ble averaged images were calculated. In the fuel tracer LIF experi- ments, acetone was seeded into the fuel as a tracer. It is clear from the experiments that a proper set of backgrounds and laser profiles are necessary to resolve the near-wall concentration profiles, even at a qualitative level. Partial resolution of the velocity boundary layer was enabled by using a slightly inclined LDA probe operated in back-scatter mode. During these conditions, it was possible to acquire velocity data within 0.2 mm from the wall. A one- dimensional model of the flow field was devised to make the con- nection between the thermal and the velocity boundary layer. The investigations suggest that wall interaction is not the respon- sible mechanism for the rather high emissions of unburned hydro- carbons from HCCI engines. It is believed that the delayed oxida- tion, indicated by the fuel tracer LIF experiments and numerical simulations, is due to the thermal boundary layer. From the data at hand, it is concluded that the thermal boundary layer is on the order of 1 mm thick. In this boundary layer the reactions are delayed but not quenched. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1033.

Kengo Tanaka, Hiroyuki Endo, Akira Imamichi, and Yuji Oda, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and Yoshinaka Takeda, and Taizo Shimada, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. The purpose of this study is to explain the characteristics of homogeneous charge compression ignition. n-Heptane, which has the same cetane number as diesel fuel, was chosen for the fuel. A rapid compression machine was used to clarify the effects of air-fuel ratio, O2 concentration, and compression temperature on ignition delay and NOx emission. These investigations allowed the introduc- tion of a formula for ignition delay. 2001-01-1034. (SP-1623) Operating characteristics of a natu- ral gas-fired homogeneous charge compression ignition engine (performance improvement using EGR). Satoshi S. Morimoto, Yasuharu Kawabata, Teruhiro Sakurai, and Toshiji Amano, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. Although Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines are expected to attain higher thermal efficiency while reduc- ing NOx emission, the operation performance suffers under high load conditions. In a previous report, we have showed the basic operating characteristics of a natural gas-fired HCCI engine. The present study focuses on the characteristics of HCCI combustion using cooled EGR. It was found that with EGR the load increased by over 20% compared with the previous baseline case. Further- more, effects of inhomogeneity are investigated by varying EGR supply methods. Inhomogeneous EGR narrows a suitable operation range for EGR and modifies the heat release pattern, indicative of the inhomogeneity to possibly regulate HCCI combustion. 2001-01-1036. (SP- 1603) Core room of the future: Utilizing technical innovations in the area of information management. Gustav Mueller, M. Seiraffi, and J. Beyerer, Hottinger North Amer- ica, Inc. A true challenge for today's foundries is the continuously increasing demand for cost-effective, but high quality castings. This demand can only be satisfied through the increased use of automa- tion and efficient quality assurance, based on modern information management solutions. In this context, the article introduces a new core-making facility concept that is based on the following tools and products: A comput- er-aided simulation tool to optimize logistical processes. A fully automatic vision inspection system for the detection of core dam- ages and processing of visual data of sand cores. A modular, com- puter-aided process control system for the recognition, analysis and visualization of all relevant production data in the core room. 2001-01-1037. (SP- 1603) Optimum engine component design and process validation using metal casting simulation tools. Ralf Kind and Steve Barry, MAGMA Foundry Technologies, Inc. Over the past several years, metal casters have made a strong commitment to better process understanding, optimization, and shortened lead times through the use of advanced technologies. Computer Aided Design and Engineering tools (CAD/CAE) are extensively utilized in the industry. Castings and production equip- ment are designed at the computer and these models are used as input into simulation tools. The machined and assembled compo- nents are checked for work load, strength and noise ratios. Further- more, raw part characteristics, resulting from the production pro- cess, which have a big influence on the achievable quality, can be simulated before the final production process is released. Filling and solidification patterns, outside cooling effects, cycle times, residual stresses, and microstructure can be simulated and evaluated. Doing simulations of alternative casting processes allows for the choice of the right production process to meet component design requirements. This paper provides an example of how casting process simula- tion can be used, up front, to optimize the design of an automotive engine component, to develop the appropriate tooling designs, and to validate the selection of casting process parameters for optimum production of the part. 2001-01-1038.

The automotive/metal casting industry has realized the need for near-net shape casting. Powertrain components are designed to assuage in close tolerance. A goal of the foundry engineer is to pro- duce cores and molds of consistent dimensional accuracy, and hence a casting satisfying the ever tighter tolerances of the automotive industry. The developers and users of chemical binders, in hot or cold box cores or on patterns for mold, all have this issue in mind. 142</page><page sequence="142">2001-01-1038-2001-01-1044 A thermal distortion tester, developed at Western Michigan Uni- versity for examining the thermo-mechanical properties of chemi- cally-bonded sands, is described.

(SP- 1603) Runner design to control defects in iron castings. Tim Hosking, Bruce Hill , and Peter Hodgson , Deakin University/Ford Motor Company of Australia. This work examines the design and implementation of a new run- ner and gating system for an existing cast iron exhaust manifold. Three designs were tested. Pressurized and unpressurized systems were trialed to determine which system produces better results in gravity casting. Runner, gate and sprue areas were varied to control the peak linear velocity during filling. These trials gave high defect levels for peak velocities over 2.0 m/s in pressurized and unpressu- rized systems, and the pressurized systems significantly reduced slag inclusions. A pressurized system with larger runner sections reduced the casting defect rate tenfold when peak gate velocity was limited to 1.0 m/s. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1040. (SP- 1600) Time averaged and unsteady near- wake analysis of cars. Brendan R. Gilhome, Jeffrey W. Saunders , and John Sheridan , Monash Univ. From an experimental investigation of a notchback car near- wake, a new topological structure for the wake is proposed. Although experiments were only conducted on notchback vehicles, the topology can be related to other car shapes. The unsteady behav- ior of the near- wake was investigated. The near- wake frequencies, which can affect ride and steering comfort, were found to be 0. 1 1 infinity/xR and 0.42 infinity/xR (xr - reattachment length). The lower frequency appears to be a result of large scale vortex shedding ('hairpin' vortex) behind the backlight/rear- window. The higher fre- quency can be attributed to the shear-layer vortices. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1041. (SP- 1600) An investigation into large-scale unsteady structures in the wake of real and idealized hatchback car models. D. B. Sims -Williams and R. G. Dominy , University of Durham; and J. P. Howell, Land Rover. There are many aspects of the unsteady flow around fastback passenger cars that remain to be understood. These include the source and nature of unsteady flow structures, the relevant time- scales, the effect of geometric parameters and the impact of the unsteadiness in terms of steady and unsteady forces on the vehicle. This paper investigates large-scale unsteady structures in the wake of the Ahmed form and of a scale model of a real car shape using two wind tunnels and model scales between 12.5% and 40%. The unsteadiness demonstrated only low coherence and weak periodicity and the Strouhal number of a given structure varied from tunnel to tunnel indicating a high sensitivity to external influences. Neverthe- less, a novel visualization technique, used to display the results of time-accurate pressure probe measurements, was able to reveal structures involving both symmetric and anti- symmetric oscillations in the strength of the rear-pillar vortices. The unsteady flow struc- tures and levels of fluctuation were very similar for different geome- tries, indicating that parameters such as radii on the vehicle surface may have surprisingly little impact on wake unsteadiness. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1042. (SP- 1600) Experimental and computational study of unsteady wake flow behind a bluff body with a drag reduction device. Bahram Khalighi, S. Zhang, and C. Koromilas, General Motors Corporation R&amp;D Center; and S. R. Bałkany i, Luis P. Bernal, G. Iaccarino, and P. Moin, University of Michigan. Simple devices have been shown to be capable of tailoring the flow field around a vehicle and reducing aerodynamic drag. An experimental and computational investigation of a drag reduction device for bluff bodies in ground proximity has been conducted. The main goal of the research is to gain a better understanding of the drag reduction mechanisms in bluff-body square-back geometries. In principle, the device modifies the flow field behind the test model by disturbing the shear layer. As a consequence, the closure of the wake is altered and reductions in aerodynamic drag of more than 20 percent are observed. We report unsteady base pressure, hot-wire velocity fluctuations and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) mea- surements of the near wake of the two models (baseline and the modified models). In addition, the flows around the two configura- tions are simulated using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations in conjunction with the V2F turbulence model. In order to capture the oscillating behavior of the wake the equations are solved in their unsteady form. The mean pressure results show a significant increase in the base pressure with the drag reduction device. For the present geometries, the drag reduction device suppresses large-scale turbulent motions in the wake. The results show a reduction of the turbulence intensity as well as a rapid upward deflection of the underbody flow with the device in place. The effect of the drag reduction device on the length of the recirculation region in the near wake is small. Furthermore, the results confirm that the separated flow from the trailing edge of the model reattaches on the extended plate (add-on device) which is similar to that of a boat-tail effect. This boat-tail effect is docu- mented by mean flow streamlines that show the dividing streamlines originating at the tip of the plates making the recirculation region narrower even though the main recirculation length does not change. Finally, both the measurements and simulations reveal that the instantaneous flow fields differ significantly from the averaged ones. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1043.

Philippe Billot, Sébastien Jallet, and Frédéric Marmonier, VALEO Wiper Systems. For wiper systems on automobiles, poor wiping at high vehicle speed is mainly due to lack of pressure under the blade caused by aerodynamic lift. This paper describes a method using aerodynamic simulation results in a mechanical calculation. The calculation pur- pose is to determine the consequences of aerodynamic uplift on pressure repartition under a wiper blade positioned on a car wind- shield. We illustrate this method by comparing the results of an innovative wiper blade design with the one of a classical blade. 2001-01-1044. (SP- 1600) Aerodynamics of vehicles through driving tunnels - Experimental study of interference and drag reduction. Ahmed F. Abdel Gawad, Zagazig Univ. Due to energy and material considerations, vehicle manufactur- ers move in the direction of producing smaller and lighter vehicles. With further reductions in the weight of vehicles, aerodynamic forces emerge as a major factor in energy and stability calculations. The situation becomes more important when moving through driv- ing tunnels. Because of the limited space of a driving tunnel, vehi- cles are usually forced to interfere severely. 1/25- scale models for domestic bus and passenger car are employed. Three-dimensional pressure measurements are recorded for analyzing the aerodynamic behavior and calculating the drag coefficient. Measurements are supported by numerical calculations and flow visualization. Results show that vehicle interference has a favorable effect on reducing drag. However, stability considerations should be noticed. 143</page><page sequence="143">2001-01-1046-2001-01-1055 2001-01-1046. (SP- 1603) Spin-casting provides functional rapid prototypes.

(SP-1603) Use of the V-Process as a rapid pro- totype and production casting technique. David Regnet, Taylor- Pohlman, Inc. The need for converting 3-D models quickly into aluminum cast- ings has found a new niche. The V-Process is unique as a form of sand casting in that the castings have a smooth surface finish and good dimensional accuracy. Moreover, the process does not require draft angles on the castings. The advantages of this casting process are: - Prototype castings in two to four weeks. - Reduced design and CAD time due to zero draft pattern requirements. - Easier and less expensive pattern con- struction. - Reduction or elimination of machining operations. -Close tolerances and good surface finish. - Easy revisions to pat- terns. - Quick turnaround using SLA- or CNC- machined patterns. -Unlimited life patterns that can be used for both prototypes and pro- duction quantities. - Wall sections as thin as .090 inch. - Cost effec- tive for prototypes and production quantities up to 20,000 Tooling or patterns for the V-Process are constructed of machined plastic or Sterolithography (SLA) models. All of these methods of producing patterns result in unlimited life patterns capa- ble of supporting both prototype and production requirements. Because of these advantages this process is an excellent choice for both prototype and production castings. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1048.

(SP-1578) Pyrotechnic knee bolster develop- ment and its contribution to car drivers safety. Patrick Borde, FAURECIA. Real- world crash investigations show that the protection of lower limbs of a motor car driver in frontal impact is still a major problem. Knees can hit rigid components behind the dashboard or the steering column (and risk some lesions like tibia or patella fracture) and the restraint systems available today still do not prevent the sub- marining effect. For these reasons, FAURECIA has developed the PYROTECH- NIC KNEE BOLSTER (PKB) which improves the lower limbs and pelvis protection and, thanks to its restraint action, improves the security of the car driver in a global way. The design of the PKB allows to avoid the contact of the knees on the rigid parts and to absorb a part of the kinetic energy of the occupant of the car. Its adjustment, according to the other restraint systems like the seat belt, the seat and the driver airbag gives to the car driver a high level of safety. The PKB development is supported by a FAURECIA methodol- ogy (called the Continuous Safety Concept) used for the safety proj- ects. The early design phase is based on numerical studies with MADYMO software. Simulations of a frontal impact tests at 56 km/h (0°-oriented rigid barrier with 100% overlap) has been performed. Thanks to specific in-house tools, optimization of the PKB design has been done with two frontal crash dummies: Hybrid III 5% and 50% drivers. These calculations were validated with experimental results on a sled test device. The goal of this paper is to present the development and optim- ization phases of the PKB and the profits in terms of safety. 2001-01-1050.

Those parts are modeled with facet surfaces and deformable bodies are used for the thorax. The remaining dummy parts are identical to an existing ellipsoid model. The facet component models have a more detailed geometry and are therefore more realistic than the ellipsoid model. The model enables accurate interaction with a FE lap belt, or seat, or airbag. The dummy model has been tested and validated using component tests and fully dummy tests. From the results, it can concluded that the model is an improved tool, which will give engineers more con- fidence concerning predictability. The model is slightly slower than the ellipsoid model, but still fast enough to perform parametric studies and optimizations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1053.

Schneider , University of Mich- igan Transportation Research Institute; and Steve Moss , and Thanh Nghi, First Technology Safety Systems. Advanced airbag systems use information from a variety of sen- sors to tune the airbag performance for crash severity and occupant characteristics. A new family of Occupant Classification ATDs (OCATD) have been developed for use in the design and testing of advanced airbag systems. This paper describes the development of anthropometric standards for an OCATD that represents a typical six-year-old child. Detailed analyses of existing child anthropome- try databases were conducted to develop reference dimensions. A child who closely matched the reference dimensions was measured in a variety of conditions. A custom molded measurement seat was constructed using foam-in-place seating material. The surface of the child's body was scanned as he sat in the custom seat, and the three- dimensional locations of body landmarks defining the skeleton posi- tion were recorded. These data were used to create a three- dimensional CAD surface representation of the six-year-old child, along with the internal location of the skeleton. Minimal scaling was required to adjust the resulting model to match the reference dimen- sions developed from the large-scale anthropometric database. The resulting OCATD dimensions accurately represent both the body segment dimensions and the exterior surface shape of a typical six- year-old child. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1058. (SP-1578) Simultaneous topology and perfor- mance redesign by large admissible perturbations for automo- tive structural design. Danet Suryatama, DaimlerChrysler Corp.; Michael M. B emit sas, University of Michigan; and Gerald F. Budn- ick and W. Joe Vitous , DaimlerChrysler Corp. A methodology for topology and performance redesign of com- plex structures by LargE Admissible Perturbations (LEAP) has been developed since 1983 in the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, the University of Michigan. LEAP theory has successfully solved various redesign problems for performance and simultaneous topological and performance changes. The redesign problem is defined as a two-state problem that consists of two struc- tural states, States SI and S2. State SI has undesirable characteris- tics or performance which does not satisfy designer specifications. The unknown State S2 has the desired structural response and/or performance. The relation between State S 1 and State S2 is highly nonlinear with respect to its response or topology. So far, LEAP algorithms have solved various redesign problems for large struc- tural changes (on the order of 100%-500%) of State SI with only one finite element analysis. The algorithm also successfully solved simultaneous structural response and topological changes with only 3-5 intermediate finite element analyses. In this work, LEAP theory is extended to solve topology and per- formance redesign problems pertinent to automotive body struc- tures. Shell quadrilateral elements are used for automotive applica- tions with plate thickness as redesign variable. The designer specifi- cations are imposed as constraints on modal dynamic and/or static displacement. A minimum change optimality criterion is used as in previous redesign problems. Topological changes give the designer guidelines on required structural stiffening. For metal sheet struc- tures, the stiffened areas can be beads or any other type of sheet metal reinforcement. The results are a stronger structure that pos- sesses the desired performance or characteristics and at the same time conforms to design space or geometric requirements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1060. (SP- 1576) Robust vehicle stability controller based on multiple sliding mode control. Byunghak Kwak , Mando Corp ; and Youngjin Park , KAIST. Vehicle stability control system can enhance the vehicle stability and handling in the emergency situations through the control of trac- tion and braking forces at the individual wheels. Because this sys- tem needs to handle the nonlinear and complex vehicle dynamics, the controller is required to have the robustness and the simple struc- ture for practical applications in order to achieve the desired perfor- mance. This paper proposes a new controller based on the multiple sliding mode control theory for vehicle stability control system to satisfy these requirements. The proposed controller for the lateral motion makes use of both the sideslip angle and the yaw rate. It brings the vehicle sideslip angle and the yaw rate close to the desired ones so that the vehicle dynamics becomes stable and the vehicle traces the desired course even in limited cornering. We show the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed controller under various driving conditions through computer simulations of a fifteen- degrees-of-freedom nonlinear vehicle model. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1063. Limited bandwidth active suspension employ- ing wheel base preview. A. M. A. Soliman, Minia Univ.; and D. A. Crolla, University of Leeds. There have been numerous studies of various forms of active sus- pensions over the past three decades. Most of published literature has reported theoretical studies and outlined the potential advan- tages in both vehicle ride and handling of such systems over their passive equivalents. One of the systems, which have been shown to have considerable practical potential is a limited bandwidth active scheme based on hydro-pneumatic components. However, in order to exploit the full potential of this arrangement, the control law should include two features; (a) the ability to exploit the wheel-base preview effect in which information at the front suspension of the vehicle is used to improve performance at the rear and (b) the ability to adapt on gain scheduling approach to a variety of different operating conditions. Both features are investigated in the paper using a four degree of freedom model and practical performance benefits are quantified. Issues relating to practical implementation, costs and power con- sumption are discussed. 2001-01-1064. Sensor fusion for accurate computation of yaw rate and absolute velocity.

In the presented sensor fusion approach, centralized filtering of related sensor signals is used to improve and correct low price sen- sor measurements. From this, we compute high-quality state infor- mation as drift-free yaw rate and exact velocity (accounting for unknown tire radius and slipping wheels on 4WD vehicles).

(SP-1583) Numerical analysis of passenger car HSDI diesel engines with the 2nd generation of common rail injection systems: The effect of multiple injections on emissions. G. M. Bianchi and P. Felloni , University of Bologna; F. E. Corc- ione, CNR - Istituto Motori ; and F. Luppino, VM-Motori. A second generation of Common-Rail injection systems is com- ing into production making feasible multiple injection strategies. This paper aims to assess the capability of multiple injection in reducing NOx and soot emissions of HSDI Diesel engines. The analysis has been carried out at a characteristic point of the EUDC emission test cycle by using a customized version of the CFD code Kiva3, with updated sub-models developed by University of Bolo- gna and University of Wisconsin. In particular, a recent modifica- tion has been introduced in the fuel conversion rate calculation in order to account for turbulence non-equilibrium effects. Different multiple injection profiles and combustion chamber configurations have been simulated and their effects on mixture formation, heat release rate and NOx and soot formation have been analyzed. The main target was to comply with emission standards without signifi- cant loss in engine performance. Computational results seem to indi- cate that split injection is very effective in reducing NOx, while soot reduction is related to a better use of the oxygen available in the combustion chamber. Significant reduction of both NOx and soot engine-out emissions will be possible once next injector technology advances will reduce further the minimum delay between two con- secutive injections allowing a more flexible injection timing. Inves- tigation has revealed that traditional re-entrant bowls of car passen- ger HSDI Diesel engine perform well in conjunction with split injec- tion since spray wall impingement is almost eliminated. As a conse- quence, the 2nd generation of Common-Rail injection system does not require large bowl diameter-to-bore ratio combustion chambers. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1069. (SP-1583) A computational investigation of water injection strategies for nitric oxide reduction in large- bore DI diesel engines. Franz X. Tanner and Matthias Brunner , Michigan Technological Univ.; and German Weisser , Wärtsilä Switzerland Ltd. Computational investigations have been conducted to study the reduction of nitric oxide formation by means of water injection into the combustion chamber of large-bore diesel engines using a KIVA- based code. The main objective has been the development of an optimal fuel/water injection strategy which minimizes the nitric oxide formation for the same amount of injected water. The investi- gated water injection techniques include the injection of water via separate injectors, the injection of fuel/water mixtures and the strati- fied injection of fuel/water packages via specially designed nozzles. Both the stratified and the emulsified injections yield best NOx reductions per injected water mass for the same power outputs and at identical cylinder peak pressures, depending on the particular injection configuration. The computational tool is a KIVA-based code where the nitric oxide formation is modeled with a variation of the extended Zel- dovich mechanism. This code has been adapted to accommodate the simulation of multiple liquid species in such a way that collisions have been limited to droplets of the same species. Comparative studies have shown that this restriction of the collisions does not sig- nificantly influence the spray behavior. 2001-01-1070. (SP-1583) Atomization of high-pressure diesel spray: Experimental validation of a new breakup model. R. Rotondi , II University of Naples; G. Bella, University of Rome uTor Vergata"; and C. Grimaldi and L. Postrioti, University of Perugia. A hybrid model for the atomization of diesel sprays was devel- oped. The model was added to the KIVA code to better simulate spray evolution. Different implementation for low-medium and high injection pressure sprays are performed. It has already been vali- dated for the low-pressure case and in this work it was tested for high injection pressure systems, in a vessel at ambient conditions. It distinguishes between jet primary breakup and droplet secondary breakup. For the latter distinct models are used, as the droplet Weber number changes in the various regimes, in order to take into account the effects of the different relevant forces. For high pressure diesel spray the effects of jet turbulence, cavitation and nozzle flow on liq- uid core primary breakup must be considered. Due to the high drop- let velocity the catastrophic secondary breakup regime may occur. Inclusion of the Rayleigh-Taylor accelerative instabilities in compe- tition with Kelvin-Helmholtz is therefore necessary to model high Weber number droplets secondary breakup. The experimental data used for the tuning of the model and for the comparison of the results are pertinent to a commercial high pressure, electronic controlled, injection system (Bosch Common Rail) for automotive diesel engines. The investigation procedure exploits a light sheet technique based on a Nd:Yag pulsed laser and a synchronized CCD camera. The measured characteristics are the spray penetration and the spray cone angles, as the fuel jet evolves in an atmospheric chamber. 2001-01-1071. (SP-1583) Multicomponent fuel consideration for spray evaporation field and spray-wall interaction. Jiro Senda and Hajime Fujimoto, Doshisha Univ. It is expected that the analysis of the evaporation process for mul- ticomponent fuels such as actual fuels like gasoline and diesel gas oil could be performed to assess more accurately the mixture prepa- ration field inside the cylinder of D.I.S.I engines and diesel engines. In this paper, we suggested the importance of this multicomponent fuel consideration relating to the mixture formation and combustion characteristics from the basis of their own fuel physical and chemi- cal properties. Then, we introduce a treatment for the phase change of a multicomponent solution through the formation of two-phase regions with the basis of chemical-thermodymical liquid-vapor equilibrium. Next, we analyze the distillation properties of a multi- component fuel as well as the evaporation process of a multicompo- nent single droplet by use of the chemical-thermodymical analysis. And, we propose a simple estimation scheme for the evaporation process of a multicomponent fuel spray, where the quasi-two phase region is considered. Then, the mixture formation process in the spray was calculated for multicomponent fuel by KIVA-II code. The spray-wall interaction process was also modeled by considering the superheating degree of the surface for the liquid spray droplets based on several experimental results in order to take into account the change in boiling phenomena at the liquid-solid interface during the impingement and post impingement process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1072.

A comparison between conventional and bio-derived fuel spray characteristics is described in this paper. Radial distributions of drop size, axial and radial velocity components were measured using a Phase-Doppler Anemometer (PDA). A digital visualization system including a CCD camera was used to estimate the spray tip penetra- tion. Fuel was injected through a single hole diesel injector into a test section at ambient pressure. An empirical expression was found to estimate the spray tip penetration at ambient conditions. 2001-01-1073. Engine lubrication system model for sump oil temperature prediction. Steve Zoz, Steve Strepek, Marc Wiseman, and Cheng Qian, Ricardo, Inc. 146</page><page sequence="146">2001-01-1073-2001-01-1080 A flow and heat transfer model of an engine lubrication system has been developed in order to predict sump oil temperature and study heat transfer mechanisms within the lubricating oil circuit. The objective was to develop the capability of simulating all the energy transfers between the oil and the combustion process, the engine coolant, and the engine bay air. The model developed in this study simulates a V8 spark-ignited engine. Included in this simula- tion is a bearing model for friction heat generation, a combustion heat input model, and component models for each key heat transfer site in the lubricating oil circuit. The model predicts sump oil tem- peratures under different engine operating conditions and simulation results were compared to test data with good agreement. The sensi- tivity of oil temperature to engine speed, engine load, coolant tem- perature, piston friction, bearing heat energy generation, piston design, water jacket depth, and oil flow rate(s) was studied. The assumptions made during modeling are discussed along with an esti- mate of their significance. Further, all of the significant heat transfer mechanisms in the oil circuit are discussed. This study shows that a lubricating oil circuit model is a useful tool for engine concept design, as well as providing an understanding of the mechanisms that effect sump oil temperatures. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1074. Oil aeration in combustion engines - Analysis and optimization. Franz Koch , Thomas Hardt, and Frank Haub- ner, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. Like all technical fluids, lubricants are able to solve gases. While solved gas is a neutral part of the lubricant, dissolved gas has an influence especially on the compressibility behavior. The effects of oil aeration on engine drive causes malfunctions of several compo- nents. A successful optimization of the oil circulation concerning the oil aeration presupposes a safe and reproducible measuring pro- cedure. The FEV has developed a measurement apparatus according to the principle of the volume measurement which allows a simple but efficient oil aeration measurement. 2001-01-1075. A new transient elastohydrodynamic (EHD) bearing model linkable to ADAMS®. Stefan Thomas and Franz Maassen, Ricardo, Inc. The new elastohydrodynamic (EHD) code developed by FEV Motorentechnik GmbH, Aachen, is designed to improve the predict- ability of journal bearing designs and thereby increase the reliability of safety factors in the development of highly loaded internal com- bustion engines. Using this tool design targets can be achieved with higher confidence levels. The developed code may be linked to commercial multibody sys- tem (MBS) codes such as ADAMS® while simultaneously repre- senting the important characteristics occurring in transiently loaded journal bearings including elastic deformation, cavitation, and non- constant speed. Static deviations from ideal journal and bearing shell shapes caused by manufacturing and assembly processes can be considered and are substantially important in the evaluation of journal bearings. Presented is an economic bearing model approach which includes elastic bearing deformations. Only a few hours of calcula- tion time are needed to reach steady state conditions on a standard workstation. 2001-01-1076. Theoretical analysis of engine bearing consid- ering both elastic deformation and oil film temperature distri- bution. Minoru Hanahashi, Takeshi Katagiri, and Yutaka Okamoto, Daido Metal Co., Ltd. Recently, the bearing performances have been analyzed by elas- tohydrodynamic lubrication theory (EHL). However, the oil film temperature is constant within a bearing clearance on this theory. As modern automotive engines are running at high rotational speed, the change of the oil film temperature is remarkable within a bearing clearance. The bearing performances are influenced by the distribu- tion of the oil film temperature. Therefore it is also necessary for the analysis of the bearing performances to consider the effect of the oil film temperature distribution by thermo elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory (TEHL). In this study, the effects of the bearing performances are investi- gated on connecting rod bearing in general gasoline engine by TEHL. Furthermore, oil film thickness, oil film pressure and oil film temperature of TEHL results are compared with those of EHL. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1077. New aluminum alloy bearing with higher wear resistance. Toru Desaki, Yasuaki Goto, and Soji Kamiya, Taiho Kogyo Co., Ltd. The recent demands for higher performance and lower fuel con- sumption of automotive engines require the bearings to operate under severe conditions. One of the problems with conventional alu- minum alloy bearings used under these conditions is the low wear resistance. A new aluminum alloy bearing that allows a higher wear resistance is developed by controlling Si particle size and lining hardness. The mechanism to upgrade the wear resistance are the concentration of enlarged Si particles on the sliding surface and to prevent falling off Si that are held by sufficient lining hardness. Wear resistance of this bearing is 4-5 times better compared with the conventional bearings and seizure resistance is two times better than the conventional bearings. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1079. Analysis of the frequency, causes and conse- quences of a common quality problem in the babbit coating of trimetal journal bearings. Rafael Schouwenaars, Sara Cerrud, and Armando Ortiz , Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. This paper investigates the frequency of surface irregularities in electrolytic babbit deposits applied in commercially available tri- metal journal bearings. It will be indicated by means of testing on an Underwood rig that the presence of irregular deposits (nodules) has a negative influence on the velocity of wear in the copper-lead bronze used as the bearing base material. The frequency of the pres- ence of nodules in commercial products will be analyzed and its causes explained by means of a quantitative metallographical study on products retired from the various stations of an industrial electro- plating line. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1080. (SP- 1579) Greenhouse gas emissions: A sys- tems analysis approach. Konrad Saur, Kevin Brady, and Andrea J. Russell, Five Winds International. The combustion of fossil fuels is increasing atmospheric concen- trations of greenhouse gases and the weight of scientific evidence indicates that these gases are producing an enhanced green house effect that is altering the global climate. To address this challenge major industrialized countries have signed onto the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In response leading companies around the world are now investigating opportunities and evaluating the risks associated with their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Creating a successful market for GHG credits will depend, in large part, on the develop- ment of credible measurement and verification protocols. Decision- makers need to be assured that an improvement option undertaken in a manufacturing plant does not result in upstream or downstream changes that will increase the overall release of GHGs. In this paper we argue that by using a systems analysis approach companies can have a broader perspective that will enable to not only measure their GHG baselines but also identify reduction opportunities and evalu- ate trade-offs. In addition, the approach fits into an environmental management system framework and is based on internationally accepted standards. A case example will be used to demonstrate this approach and to show the short- and long-term benefits of such a perspective. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 147</page><page sequence="147">2001-01-1081-2001-01-1087 2001-01-1081. (SP- 1579) Future light-duty vehicles: Predict- ing their fuel consumption and carbon-reduction potential. F. AuYeung, J. B. Heywood, and A. Schafer , Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The transportation sector in the United States is a major contribu- tor to global energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. To assess the future potentials of different technologies in addressing these two issues, we used a family of simulation programs to predict fuel consumption for passenger cars in 2002. The selected technol- ogy combinations that have good market potential and could be in mass production include: advanced gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles with automatically shifting clutched transmissions, gasoline, diesel, and compressed natural gas hybrid electric vehicles with continuously variable transmissions, direct hydrogen, gasoline and methanol reformer fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles with direct ratio drive, and battery electric vehicle with direct ratio drive. Using appropriately researched assumptions and input variables, calculations were performed to estimate the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of the different technol- ogy combinations. Comparing the results for the vehicle driving cycle only, an evolutionary fuel consumption improvement of about 35 percent can be expected for the baseline gasoline car, given only market pressures and gradual regulatory requirements. With more research and investment in technology, an advanced gasoline engine car may further reduce fuel consumption by 12%, and a gasoline electric hybrid by 40%, as compared to the evolutionary car. Diesel versions of the advanced combustion and hybrid vehicles may be 10-15% better than their gasoline counterparts. Compressed natural gas hybrid vehicle may reduce fuel consumption by 3-4% but may reduce carbon dioxide emission by 25%. Meanwhile, a direct hydro- gen fuel cell electric hybrid vehicle may have the greatest improve- ment over the baseline at 55%, but the gasoline and methanol reformers fuel cell versions appear very expensive and offer little benefit. Finally, aside from critical battery limitations, the electric vehicle is difficult to compare to other vehicles without taking into account the electricity generation process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1082. The role of information technology: Regula- tory compliance, operating efficiencies, and enterprise sustaina- bility. Thomas E. Chambers , ESP, Inc. A major challenge for organizations is generating and reporting on all of the items of data necessary today to maintain regulatory compliance. Traditional manual, non-systematized methods are insufficient to meet these challenges. Furthermore, the same data can be put to use to examine trends, production rates, material con- sumption, ...in short, the data can be employed to look at operating conditions, providing insight into opportunities to improve those operations, and supporting the long-term sustainability of an enter- prise. Many organizations have begun the exercise of systematizing and mechanizing the collection, manipulation, and ultimate use of data only to find, at the end of a long and costly process, that the product that was created or delivered fell well short of their expecta- tions. This paper will examine critical aspects of scoping and selecting the best approach for an enterprise in EMIS (Environmental Man- agement Information System) application. It will address how to begin the information gathering to establish internal work, task man- agement, and process flow, how to work with outside resources to refine expectations, the pro's and con's of the "build it or buy it" decision, and the elements necessary to consider when establishing a ROI expectation. A properly selected and maintained EMIS system can not only assist a company in achieving and maintaining an enviable environ- mental compliance record, but it can also utilize data gathered to this end to improve the production efficiency of operating components of a facility, such as paint booths. 2001-01-1084.

A mobile system to measure toxicity levels in crew compartments from live fire missions. Dominick Salafia , David L. Pond ', and Norberto L. DeLeon , U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground USAYPG. As part of the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) the Metrology and Simulation Division at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG) has the mission to measure and record the detri- mental effects of firing conventional and experimental munitions on gun crews under live fire testing. In order to provide a safer environment for soldiers and to com- ply with national and international military specifications, the Mea- surements and Simulation Branch of the Metrology and Simulation Division at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground has developed a mobile system to quantitatively analyze and record the level of tox- icity present in the crew compartment of a variety of military vehi- cles.

(SP- 1600) Effects of vehicle A-pillar shape on local mean and time-varying flow properties. Firoz Alam , Simon Watkins , and Gary Zimmer , RMIT Univ.; and Clive Humphris, Ford Motor Company of Australia. Separated flow is the main generator of aerodynamic noise in passenger vehicles. The flow around the A-pillar is central to the wind noise as many modern vehicles still have high fluctuating pres- sures due to flow separations in this region. Current production vehicle geometry is restricted due to the amount of three dimension- ality possible in laminated windscreen glass (and door opening, etc.). New materials e.g., polycarbonate) offer the possibility of more streamlined shapes which allow less or no flow separation. Therefore, a series of experimental investigations have been con- ducted to study the effects of the A-pillar and windshield geometry and yaw angles on the local flow and noise using a group of ideal- ized road vehicle models. Surface mean and fluctuating pressures were measured on the side window in the A-pillar regions of all models at different Reynolds numbers and yaw angles. Flow visual- ization was also used to see the flow structure and supplement the surface mean and fluctuating pressure data. Frequency-based analy- sis was conducted. The studies show that depending upon the curva- tures of A-pillar and windshield, the fluctuating pressure coeffi- cients can be reduced significantly. Reynolds number sensitivities were minimal and the surface mean and fluctuating pressures can be scaled if no feedback mechanism is present. A relationship between the surface fluctuating pressure coefficients and local A-pillar radii was established. 2001-01-1087. (SP-1600) Comparison of a high blockage wind tunnel, an open jet wind tunnel and on-road testing with respect to external surface pressures. Gary Zimmer, Firoz Alam, and Simon Watkins, RMIT Univ.; and Christian Peric, General Motors Holden Australia. Noise in passenger cars is dependent upon the fluctuating surface pressures on the exterior, particularly in the region of the A-pillar and the front side glass. The purpose of this work was to investigate whether the fluctuating surface pressure profile obtained in a typical full-size automotive wind tunnel can be duplicated within the limita- 148</page><page sequence="148">2001-01-1087-2001-01-1099 tions of high blockage tunnel. A further aim was to compare the data from both wind tunnels with road data. In order to investigate the spatial resolution of fluctuating pressures on the side window of a car, flush-mounted microphones were used as fluctuating pressure transducers. Mean pressure coefficients were obtained from flush- mounted pressure taps in the same locations. Frequency-based (spectral) analysis was carried out on the fluctuating pressure signal. It was found that the regions of flow separation coincide with the regions of maximum fluctuating pressure. There is good correlation between the high blockage wind tunnel and the on-road tests, whilst there are discrepancies in those obtained in the open jet tunnel. Finally while the static and fluctuating pressures largely showed lit- tle velocity dependency, there was a noticeable deviation in some locations at high speed on road. The cause for this effect is not known at this stage, and is the subject of further investigation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1091. Mixture formation analysis of a Schnurle-type two-stroke gasoline DI engine. Yasuo Moriyoshi and Kazuhiro Mori , Chiba Univ.; and Koji Morikawa and Hideharu Takimoto, Subaru Research Center. Because the two- stroke gasoline engine has a feature of high power density, it might become a choice for automobiles' power train if the high HC exhaust emissions and high fuel consumption rate could be improved. As the GDI technology is quite effective for two-stroke engines, a Schnurle-type small engine was modified to a GDI engine, and its performance was tested. Also, numerical anal- ysis of the mixture-formation process was carried out. Results indi- cated it was possible to reduce both the HC emissions and fuel con- sumption drastically with the same maximum power as a carbureted engine at WOT condition. However, misfiring in light load condi- tion was left unresolved. Numerical analysis clarified the process of how the mixture formation got affected by the injector location, injection timing, and gas motion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1092. Optical combustion measurements of a high- performance two-stroke engine. S. Longdill, R. Raine, and G. Blanchard, University of Auckland; and W. Wright, Buckley Systems Ltd. This paper describes how an optical method has been used to investigate aspects of combustion in a high-performance two-stroke engine. The method involves measurement of the intensity of the light emitted at two wavelengths corresponding to the CH and C2 radicals created in the combustion process on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The effect of engine operating variables such as ignition timing and air-fuel ratio on the combustion light emission were examined. Comparisons are presented between the combustion light intensity measurements and conventional cylinder pressure based combustion analysis techniques. Characteristics of the light emitted by these radicals are shown to be strongly related to cylinder pressure and air-fuel ratio. 2001-01-1094. Numerical simulation of the scavenging pro- cess in a two-stroke turbocharged diesel engine. J. R. Arias, E. Varela, R. Pérez , E. Navarro, and E. Moreno, Universidad Politec- nica de Madrid. In the present paper the application of a scavenging model in a two- stroke diesel engine with four radial cylinders and symmetric scavenging forced by a turbocharger is described. Besides the engine model, the turbocharger and pulse converter, where the exhaust pipes end, were simulated as described in the text. The empirical coefficients have been fixed by means of the comparative study of the results obtained with a three-dimensional model. The simulation model has been used in two cases, for the validation of itself, comparing the results obtained with the measurements in a test rig, and for the prediction of the performances of the four radial cylinders of the diesel engine described in a previously published paper. 2001-01-1096. Prediction of mass emissions from two and three wheelers powered by two-stroke engines. S. Sampath, Balaji Sampath, Balaji Suresh, and P. S. Sriram, SVCE. The abnormal situation of exhaust emissions from the two and three wheelers powered by small two-stroke engines in India and the emission regulations according to the Indian Driving Cycle (IDC) to control the atmospheric pollution from these sources are described. Constant Volume Sampling (CVS) test facilities using a chassis dynamometer will be expensive for many agencies which are required to estimate the mass emissions on a realistic basis. This paper describes a simulation model to infer the mass emissions per km drive on the IDC, using the static performance results of the engine tested on the laboratory dynamometer facility. The simulated test-bed results are found to compare reasonably with those obtained on the vehicle fitted with a similar engine on the chassis dynamome- ter using the CVS system. 2001-01-1098. Road tests adopted to analyze cars' vibrational behavior. Detlef K. Kudritzki, AUDI AG. Optimization of ride comfort is becoming increasingly important in chassis development. Constantly rising traffic density and com- fort-orientated customer preferences are mainly responsible for this. Comfort and its improvement are important, not only on bad road surfaces, but also on even surfaces. The complexity of analysis leads to a strong link between car testing and simulation. The testing itself is divided in to roadtests and test stands. It is of outstanding importance to analyze the vehicles vibrational behavior from road tests as it is a real life situation. In order to get meaningful results from the roadtest the vehicle has to be seen as a complete vibrational system. The vibrational behavior of a system is clearly defined by input and output of the system. Road tests are chosen in relation to the predicted car. The roads surface is the input of the system exciting the vibrational subsystems of a car. The ride tests are used for the evaluation of drive response behav- ior. They are complemented by subjective assessment. Open loop tests were carried out for the evaluation of ride comfort. For a com- prehensive evaluation of ride comfort, the most widely different forms of excitation are necessary. The vehicle is stimulated funda- mentally by deterministic and non-deterministic, road-generated signals. In addition to system-theoretical considerations, practical experiences from the ride test are also considered. This is necessary to discover which excitation form will provide the most comprehen- sive description of the vibrational behavior of the system. The analysis procedures used are: Time and frequency range rep- resentation, running mode analysis in time and frequency domain and modal analysis. Its the combination of those methods together with the engineers experience, which leads to the results of the mea- surement to a meaningful analysis. How to use mentioned tools will be shown with a focus on practi- cal work and some animations. 2001-01-1099.

Kouji Ohta, Yasushi Sugiyama, Hitoshi Kawabe, and Yoshihiro Kohtake, Sumi- tomo Wiring Systems, Ltd.; and Masashi N arita, Tomohiro Keishi, and Mikio Kaji, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. With the rapid advances in electronic control within automobiles, the junction block (J/B), primarily used for electrical transmission and electrical wiring, has begun to house electronic control units. It is evolving into an active component with smart functions that also controls vehicle devices, at the core of the wiring harness. We have developed a method using CAE to predict the fatigue failure life of J/B brackets for use as a design-assist tool in the early stage of J/B development. 149</page><page sequence="149">2001-01-1099-2001-01-1 109 Failure of J/B brackets starts with the repetitive stress generated in the brackets during resonance. This stress is maximum at primary natural vibration which is the lowest frequency during resonance. By accurately estimating the above-mentioned stresses using CAE, we established a method to determine the number of vibra- tions at which fatigue failure of the J/B bracket would occur (fatigue failure life) from the fatigue failure life characteristics of the mate- rial. It is expected that the man-hours required to perform conven- tional evaluation tests will be greatly reduced by utilizing this method. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1100. Fatigue damage on vehicle's body shell: A cor- relation between durability and torsion tests. Flavio Antonio Cotta Vidal , FIAT Automóveis s.a.; and Ernâni Sales Palma, Ponti- ficia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais. The purpose of this article is to present a correlation between fatigue damage caused on vehicle's body shell during durability tests at a road simulator and during torsion test of the body shell at a test machine. The durability test alternates a variety of road tracks, paving and land surface, as well as loading condition of the vehicle, whether loaded or empty. The torsion test consists of a test machine in which it is possible to apply a torsion moment on the body shell. Through the results obtained in the vehicle's durability test it is possible to associate a real number of kilometers with an estimated number of cycles at the body shell torsion test. This way, it is intended to optimize the response time for the technical approval of the components related to the body shell, resulting in a reduced development cost. This correlation is based on material's strength fundaments, cumulative damage under cyclical loadings related to fatigue, in accelerated tests on mechanical components and in the experimental stress analysis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1101. A new way of electrical/electronic systems endurance testing of vehicles in a real-world environment prior to production launch. Moin Ahmed, David L. Welker, and Richard J. Rudy, DaimlerChrysler Corp. With the increasing emphasis on Systems Engineering, there is a need to ensure that Electrical/Electronic (E/E) Systems Endurance Testing of vehicles, in a real- world environment, prior to Production Launch, is performed in a manner and at a technological level that is commensurate with the high level of electronics and computers in contemporary vehicles. Additionally, validating the design and performance of individual standalone electronic systems and mod- ules "on the bench" does not guarantee that all the permutations and combinations of real-world hardware, software, and driving condi- tions are taken into account. Traditional Proving Ground (PG) vehi- cle testing focuses mainly on powertrain durability testing, with only a simple checklist being used by the PG drivers as a reminder to cycle some of the electrical components such as the power win- dow switches, turn signals, etc. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1102. Equipment for accelerated reliability testing of cars and their components. Lev M. Klyatis, ERS Engineering Corp.; and Evgeny Klyatis, U.S.R. Electronics, Ltd. This paper analyses the current approaches in the development of accelerated stress testing, and describes why present test equip- ment cannot provide the simulation of simultaneous combination of basic field influences on the car and car's components. The authors show a new perspective for the evaluation of equipment develop- ment for accelerated testing (AT) which would eliminate the above negative aspect and solve the problem of accurate simulation of real- life input influences on the natural product for its reliability improvement. 2001-01-1103. Methodology for accelerating life tests on shock absorbers. Stefaan W. Duym and Xavier A. Lauwerys, Ten- neco Automotive. Horizontal and vertical axle and cabin dampers are used on cars, trucks and busses to optimize the ride and safety and therefore repre- sent vital components of the truck suspension. Nowadays there is a trend in industry for a longer component life featured by a shorter- term design. Therefore it becomes less obvious to have too many iterations in design with successive (long) durability test drives. Using the presented methodology the potential life damage for each critical component is identified from realistic road measurements and a life test is proposed which causes the same damage but in a relatively shorter period. This methodology was drawn up and vali- dated during a European research program, Fatynamics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1104. Applied synergy in automotive test systems. Norman E. Schweitzer, Parker Bay Engineering. The objective of this paper is to show how synergy can be applied to automotive components testing to reduce component development test time. The test system designed by the author reduced time required for developmental testing by 88 percent. The system combined durabil- ity vibration testing with environmental stress testing. Design fac- tors considered during the development of this system include health, safety, ergonomics, constructability, isolation, connectivity, cost, and environmental protection. The principles used in developing this system can be translated into a general set of rules for the development of testing systems using synergy. 2001-01-1105. Exhaust system key life test. Gang Song, David Fan, and Larry J. Geer, Tenneco Automotive Inc. The automotive industry is heading in the direction of signing off exhaust system durability based on rig simulation tests rather than running physical vehicles on the proving ground. This is due to the cost, time, and availability of prototype, pre-production vehicles, and the durability track itself. To this end, several types of test rigs for exhaust systems have been developed, such as single table rig and dual table rig. New methods are also being developed in exhaust rig simulation that significantly reduce development time and pro- gram risk. The exhaust test rig has been implemented physically, however, the rig simulation procedures and methods have not yet been investi- gated thoroughly. There are many issues that can and do influence simulation quality, such as selection of control, iteration channel preparation, and control channel optimization. In addition, the cou- pling effect between the powertrain and test rig through the powertrain mounts could produce high nonlinear behavior for the test rig. Sensitivity study is proposed in this paper to find out the optimal direction to tune the drive file, to get the desired rig to road correlation. 2001-01-1109. The Six Sigma implementation process. Forrest W. Breyfogle and Becki Meadows, Smarter Solutions Incor- porated. Six Sigma, if implemented successfully, is a strategic business improvement approach that increases both customer satisfaction and an organization's financial health through systemic process change. In this paper we will be describing a Smarter Six Sigma SolutionsSM (S4) business strategy, which can lead to significant new opportuni- ties and the reduction of fire fighting. This long-term process focused strategy facilitates companies in identifying and under- standing critical business processes such that they become more proactive as well as productive. 150</page><page sequence="150">2001-01-1 1 13- 2001-01-1 121 2001-01-1113. Integrating Six Sigma, performance excellence and ISO 9001:2000. Stanley A. Marash, STAT-A-MATRIX, INC. Many people have noticed that enterprises small, medium and large have experienced many different programs that have professed to be the answer to all of the enterprises' ills. This paper will address the ten steps to excellence and describe how they apply to Six Sigma, performance excellence and ISO 9001:2000 as well as describing how the three initiatives can be effectively deployed as one common process. 2001-01-1116. Six Sigma quality: Points and counterpoints. Hans J. Bajaría , Multiface, Inc. "Six Sigma" quality is a buzzword in the quality community throughout the world. "Six Sigma" quality is defined as achieving reduction in the variation which allows for a ± 1 .5 sigma shift (Harry Mikel 1997). It is also described as a philosophy, methodology, and a breakthrough strategy to solve problems. This paper presents an in-depth examination into the heads and tails of the "six-sigma qual- ity" concept. The objective is to become better informed about the benefits of six-sigma quality. Actual examples and case studies illustrate its merits and warn against limitations and misuses. The ultimate objective is to understand six-sigma quality and place it in an appropriate context to reap the benefits. 2001-01-1117. Six Sigma quality - PDCA methodology. G. Michael Smith , Valeo Automotive NA. There are many tools available in the philosophy of six sigma and all of them share one thing in common. A structured approach to problem solving. A structured approach will have application no matter what the nature of the problem or where in the organization it might fall. By following a discipline an effective solution to a problem can be found efficiently and at minimal cost with long lasting effects. This paper uses a specific problem of variation in design that was discovered in a brand new application of an existing technology. The form of problem solving is known by many names such as TOPs, Brainstorming, PDCA, and other acronyms but they are all designed to do the same thing, organize the thinking process and structure the approach to determine the final solution without guess- ing. In this instance the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) approach was applied to determine the root cause of the variation of a hydraulic valve. The solution turned out to be a two-part design solution provid- ing both variation control and robustness to the application. The manufacturer was able to take the existing product to new levels of performance never before experienced or anticipated. 2001-01-1118. (SP-1611) PTFE compounds in automotives. James S. Temple and Gale Baumgartner , Dyneon LLC. Compounds of polytetrafiuoroethylene (PTFE) are widely used in the automotive industry worldwide, especially in high- performance dynamic seals, such as piston rings, transmission seal rings and radial crankshaft seals. Fillers are blended with virgin PTFE to selectively improve physical properties without compro- mising the unique lubrication behavior (the art of compounding). Dyneon LLC, a 3M Company, is the world's largest compounder of PTFE and also leads in the testing and design of state-of-the art compounds offering selected combinations of properties. PTFE is not processed like a "normal" thermoplastic, but in a fashion similar to ceramic or powdered metal. This paper outlines the technology to process PTFE, modified PTFE and their compounds and the types of fillers currently used. The physical property enhancements given by various fillers are illustrated graphically. Data include wear resis- tance (tribological data) and deformation-under-load at elevated temperature (extrusion resistance). Two illustrative examples of successful solutions to real-life automotive sealing problems are outlined. 2001-01-1119.

Larry Waksman, Shin-Etsu Silicones of America , Inc.; and Hirofumi Kishita, Shin-ichi Sato , and Yasuo 7 arumi, Shin-Etsu Chemical Company, Ltd. This paper will introduce SHIN-ETSU SIFELVSR, which is based on a perfluoroether polymer backbone combined with an addition-curing silicone crosslinker. Perfluoroether elastomer offers a wider range of processing options, improved low-temperature properties, long-term heat resistance, self-priming adhesion, excel- lent electrical properties, purity, and improved resistance to a wider range of fuels, solvents, acids, and bases compared to standard fluor- oelastomers. The introduction of perfluoroether elastomers provides engineers with a wide range of opportunities to improve the processing and performance of sealing, coating and bonding operations across the spectrum of automotive and aerospace applications exposed to fuels and other harsh environments. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1120. (SP-1611) Development of multi-layer plastic membrane (bladder membrane) for vapor reducing fuel tank. Koichiro Hayashi , Masahiro Mikami, and Katsutoshi Miura, Toyota Motor Corp. The Vapor-Reducing Fuel Tank System (Bladder Tank System) using a flexible plastic membrane (Bladder Membrane) was newly developed in order to reduce the amount of vaporized gasoline in a steel fuel tank. This Bladder Membrane is flexible to expand in proportion to a fuel volume and prevents the permeation of the vaporized gasoline. As a result of our initial study for various materials, we decided to apply a multi-layer plastic material which could achieve both low fuel permeability and good flexibility. This multi-layer material consists of polyethylene(PE) for struc- tural material and polyamide(PA) for low permeability. The modu- lus of the PE needs to achieve a sufficient flexibility in order to keep the movement of the membrane. While PA material must have not only low fuel permeability but also strong adhesion with the struc- tural material of PE. We also clarify the membrane design to keep a good flexibility and to reduce a strain. Especially, the optimized design of the bead could be determined by our CAE analysis. This tank system was introduced to Toyota Hybrid System (THS) released in May 2000. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1121. (SP-1611) Development of a novel polyolefinic thermoplastic vulcanízate for fuel line covering applications. Tony McNally and Paul McShane, Queen 's University of Belfast; Mark Mark Cook and Andrew Andrew Miller, MVC Technology; and Gerard Gerard McNally and Raymond Murphy, Queen 's Uni- versity of Belfast. Blends of Thermoplas™, a TPE based on blends of polypropyl- ene and ethylene/a-olefin copolymers with various additives were prepared using a twin screw extruder. The mechanical, impact, Theo- logical, thermal and chemical properties of the resultant blends and those of two commercially available TPE' s (CTPE1 and CTPE2) used in fuel line covering applications were measured. Thermo- plas™ had a percentage elongation at break of up to three times greater than both commercial materials, was more flexible, and had better impact strength at 25 °C and -40° C. Thermoplas™ was less viscous than CTPE1 and CTPE2 in the shear rate range normally experienced during tube extrusion, when measured using capillary rheometry techniques. The lower viscosity of Thermoplas™ was also evident during cross-head extrusion trials, with line speeds for certain grades 50% greater than that achievable with CTPE1 and CTPE2. Thermoplas™ passed all heat-aging and chemical- conditioning tests to SAE J2027. 151</page><page sequence="151">2001-01-1122-2001-01-1128 2001-01-1122. (SP-1611) Immersion study of selected engi- neering plastics at elevated temperatures. Dwight D. Smith, Michael J. Braeckel, Joseph G. Tajar, and John B. Yourtee, Ticona ; and Randall A. Gay, PerkinElmer Fluids Science. Engineering plastics in automotive fuel system components must perform at a consistently high level under very demanding condi- tions. This study, which expands upon one that Ticona conducted in 1991 evaluates selected plastics in the new generation of more reactive ethanol/methanol fuel blends at two temperatures that are representative of current fuel tank (65°C) and engine compartment (121 °C) conditions for 5000 hours of exposure. Plastics tested were poly acetal (co/homo polymers), polypheny lene sulfide, polybutyl- ene terephthalate, aliphatic polyketone, nylon 6/6 and high tempera- ture nylon. An independent testing laboratory following SAE and ISO protocols did the actual immersion and testing. The study confirms the importance of long term testing to assist in understanding of how aggressive, alternative fuels and plastics interact. The study validates the relative performance benefits and continued use in automotive fuel applications of Celcon® polyacetal copolymers at fuel tank conditions and Fortron® polyphenylene sul- fide at engine compartment conditions. 2001-01-1123. (SP-161 1) A comparative study of the integrity of joints between multilayer fuel line constructions and different connector 'barb' designs - Part 2. Mark Cook, Andrew Miller, Adrian Mancell, and Roger Page, Ticona; and Barney Eley, Lough- borough Univ. Last year, McKechnie Vehicle Components established (Paper 2000-01-1098) that there were two factors influencing joint integrity between a multilayer fuel tube and the barb design of a plastic quick connector: The relationship between barb O.D. and tube I.D.; The type of lining material of the tube and the overall hoop stress the tube applies to the joint after assembly. It was recommended that future work should address the follow- ing points if a full understanding of the fuel tube material to barb type is to be achieved: Assess the sealability of different materials onto a common barb type; Assess a range of different barb designs to depict the optimum. This year the authors have attempted to address the above points. Two conductive liquid fuel tubes of different commercial sizes (American and European) were manufactured in commercial mul- tilayer structures. These had different material inner layers (PA 12 and PBT). The tubes were joined to commercial conductive quick connectors (7.89mm SAE J2044 stub size specification) of 3 barb designs. The first barb design is used in Europe, Asia and South America on 8x6mm tube. The second barb design is used in USA on 8.35x6.35mm tube. The third barb design contains an 'O' ring and is used globally on 8x6mm tube. The burst strength of the tubes was measured to give an indica- tion of the hoop stress applied by the tube on the barb. Comparative room temperature 'pull off and leakage test data was obtained on both unconditioned and conditioned joints. Explanations were made based on the observed differences in materials, tube dimensions and barb design. 2001-01-1124. (SP-161 1) Performance in diesel and biodiesels of fluorosilicone rubber materials used for automotive quick connector fuel line O-rings and other sealing applications. Tim Maxson and Bill Logan, Dow Corning Corp.; and Shona O'Brien, Dow Corning Limited. Consumers in Europe are purchasing automobiles with diesel engines at an accelerating rate. In addition, European governments are increasingly looking to diesel blends (such as biodiesel, which combines diesel at various levels with oil derived from the Rapeseed plant) as a directly substitutable fuel to 100% petroleum-based die- sel. One major concern of the automotive industry is the perfor- mance of different elastomeric parts in the new fuels. O-rings made from high modulus fluorosilicone elastomers are used predomi- nantly in automotive fuel line quick-connects. This study reviews the performance of fluorosilicone rubber in diesel and biodiesel blends. 2001-01-1126. (SP-1611) Fuel permeation testing - Configurations, methods, and correlations. Paul Tuckner, Dyneon. As the requirements for evaporative emissions become more stringent and the time for their implementation approaches, the importance of understanding the relationship between test methods and performance become critical. Everyone is trying to define rea- sonable methods that can lead to an understanding of materials and components and their impact on full vehicle Sealed Housing Emis- sions Determination (SHED) performance. SAE task forces have been created to examine some of these methods with the intention of defining standard procedures that everyone can use to test materi- als and constructions in a uniform and consistent manner. The four subcommittees formed include 1) Permeation Testing of Materials using Gravimetric Methods, 2) Permeation Testing of Hoses using Gravimetric Methods, 3) Speciation of Fuels during Permeation using FID Method, and 4) SHED testing of Components. The objec- tive of these subcommittees is to define procedures that can be used by both suppliers of components and materials, as well as OEMs to compare and predict performance of possible designs to meet the new emissions requirements. This paper presents permeation data that evaluates gravimetric methods and shows new extensions of these methods for evaluating permeation for specific seal applications and components. It is intended as an extension of the work begun in SAE Paper 2000-01- 0196. The data presented was developed in cooperation with the first two subcommittees. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1127. (SP-1611) Permeation and stress relaxation resistance of elastomeric fuel seal materials. Ronald D. Stevens, DuPont Dow Elastomers L.L.C. Today's fuel systems place many demands on the seals contain- ing liquid and vapor hydrocarbons. California Air Resource's LEV II and EPA' s Tier 2 demands require fuel systems which are essen- tially hermetically sealed with a robust, long-term (12-15 year), life. Two properties which are key to long-term seal life are the materi- al's ability to retain it's sealing force, and the ability to resist fuel permeation. To evaluate these two fuel seal properties, testing was conducted on a number of rubber compounds including HNBR, an HNBR- fluoroplastic alloy, FVMQ (fluorosilicone), an FKM-FVMQ blend, and FKM. To evaluate permeation through a seal, Thwing Albert cups were fitted with stainless steel lids and sealing gaskets prepared from the various test materials. Fuel losses through the gaskets were determined at elevated temperatures. Long-term, &gt;1000 hour, stress relaxation testing was conducted in "hot" 60°C fuel and "sour" fuel on these compounds. The results of the permeation though sealing materials and the stress relaxation in fuel will be presented in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1128.

(SP- 16 14) LS-DYNA3D simulation of sheet metal forming using damage based user subroutine. C. L. Chow and X. J. Yang , University of Michigan; and E. Chu , Alcoa Inc. LS-DYNA3D has been widely used to perform computer simula- tion of sheet metal forming. In the material library of LS-DYNA3D there are a number of user defined material models. In order to take full advantage of the material subroutines, it is important for the users to be able to display user defined history variables in the post processing and to establish user-defined failure criterion. In this report, the development of a damage coupled plastic model is firstly described. The damage model is then programmed in a user defined material subroutine. This is followed by performing finite element simulation of sheet metal forming with the LS-DYNA3D that has incorporated the damage coupled plastic model. The way to display the user defined history variables and how to deal with the failure criterion during the post-processing of ETA/DYNAFORM are described. History variable distributions at several time steps are displayed and discussed in this paper. 2001-01-1130. (SP-1614) Combining a statistical design of experiments with formability simulations to predict the forma- bility of pockets in sheet metal parts. G. Paul Montgomery , Jr. and Lynn T. Truss , General Motors Corporation Research and Development Center. The design of pockets on automotive sheet metal parts can signif- icantly affect part formability. We have developed regression for- mulas for predicting the failure depth of a symmetric rectangular pocket as a function of the geometric parameters that define the pocket. The formulas were developed by statistically selecting com- binations of geometric pocket parameters for formability analysis and using formability simulations to determine the pocket failure depth for each selected parameter combination. The regression for- mulas were tested by comparing their predictions with simulations for combinations of part parameters not used to develop the formulas. 2001-01-1131. (SP-1614) Continuos failure prediction model for nonlinear load paths in successive stamping and crash pro- cesses. H. Dell and H. Gese, MATFEM ; L. KeBler , Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG; and H. Werner and H. Hooputra , BMW Group. The validity of numerical simulations is still limited by the unknown failure of materials when nonlinear load paths in succes- sive stamping and crash processes occur. Localized necking is the main mechanism for fractures in ductile sheet metal. The classical forming limit curve (FLC) is limited to linear strain paths. To include the effects of nonlinear strain paths a theoretical model for instability (algorithm CRACH) has been used. The algorithm has been developed on the basis of the Mar- ciniak model. The calibration and validation of this approach is done by a set of multistage experiments under static and dynamic strain rates for a mild steel. 2001-01-1132. (SP-1614) The bulge of tubes and a failure cri- terion for tube hydroforming. Kuo-Kuang Chen, General Motors Corp. The bulge test in hydroforming is a simple fundamental experi- ment used to obtain basic knowledge in tube expansion. The results can be used to assist design and manufacturing of hydroformed automotive parts. It also can be used to develop a failure criterion for tubes in hydroforming. For these purposes, a section of a long unsupported tube with fixed ends was simulated numerically to obtain the mechanical states of the tube subjected to internal pres- sure. Steel and aluminum tubes are used. For the bulge tests, the internal pressure reaches a maximum and then decreases in value without failure while the stress, strain and volume of the tube keep increasing. A failure criterion for the bursting of a tube is proposed based on the stress-strain curve of the material. For the steel and alu- minum tubes used in this paper, the bursting diameters of the tubes are very close to their corresponding failure diameters obtained based on the conventional forming limit diagrams used in sheet metal forming. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1133. (SP-1614) Applications of high strength steels in hydroforming dual phase vs. HSLA. X. M. Chen, M. F. Shi, and P. M. McKune, U.S. Steel Automotive Center ; and S. M. Chen, Ford Motor Co. Dual-Phase (DP) high-strength steel is widely used in Europe and Japan for automotive component applications, and has recently drawn greater attention in the North American automotive industry for improving crash performance and reducing weight. In compari- son with high- strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel grades with similar initial yield strength, DP steel has the following advantages: higher strain hardening, higher energy absorption, higher fatigue strength, higher bake hardenablility, and no yield point elongation. This paper compares the performance of DP and HSLA steel grades before, during, and after hydroforming. Computer simulation results show that DP steel demonstrates more uniform material flow during hydroforming, better crash performance and less wrinkling tendency. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1134. (SP-1614) Tube hydroforming process devel- opment with the aid of computer simulation. Jay Liu, Budd Co. The manufacturing process of a cross member rail begins with a thin-walled tube and comprises forming operations of tube bend- ing, pre-forming and final hydroforming. Computer simulation has been used to optimize each forming operation to reduce tool cost and lead-time by providing virtual tryout before hard tool construc- tion begins. This paper summaries the process development with the aid of computer simulation of hydroforming of a cross member rail. Tube bending process has been modeled as rotary draw bending with 3-ball mandrel. The mandrel size is critical to control thinning and buckling at the outside and inside of the bend, respectively. After bending, the circumference of the tube at the bend area is reduced by about 6%. This bend circumference reduction has to be considered during the product design stage, especially for the bend where end feeding can hardly be reached in the hydroforming. To obtain an optimized cross section of the tube for the hydroforming, a die pre-forming operation is developed. The pre-forming is also an opportunity to avoid pinching during the hydroforming die close. With optimized cross sections of the pre-formed tube, a minimum amount of material needs to be redistributed around the circumfer- ence as the tube expands to fill the die cavity during the hydroform- ing. In the hydroforming operation, process variables such as inter- nal pressure, tube end feeding and tool geometry were optimized with the simulation to improve the forming safety margin of the process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1135. (SP-1614) The effect of binder conditions on draw depth in aluminum panel forming. Steffen Beck and Klaus Siegert, Institute for Metal Forming Technology; and Klaus J. Wein- mann, Michigan Technological Univ. In sheet metal forming, metal flow into the die is determined by the restraint imposed by both the blankholder force and the draw- bead penetration. This paper describes an experimental investigation in which both advanced binder force and drawbead technologies are used to study their effect on draw depth in the drawing of an AA6111-T4 generic non-symmetric panel. Multipoint binder load- ing using individual pin force adjustment applied to especially designed binder structures as well as the use of variable blankholder force were investigated in one laboratory in Germany. In another laboratory in the USA, active drawbeads were applied to the draw- 153</page><page sequence="153">2001-01-1 135- 2001-01-1 142 ing of the generic panel.

(SP-1614) An experimental technique to deter- mine the behaviour of sheet metal in a drawbead. Daniel E. Green , Industrial Research &amp; Development Institute. The behavior of sheet metal flowing through a drawbead is of significant interest to engineers in the stamping industry. Indeed, the drawbead configuration determines not only the forces that restrain the metal as it flows into the die but also affects how the material workhardens prior to the forming process. The purpose of this work was to experimentally determine in- situ bending radii in a strip while it is pulled through a drawbead. This was achieved by mount- ing a camera onto the binder of a single-action channel draw die near the end of a drawbead insert. Fiber optic cables were used to direct light in the closed die onto the edge of the sheet. Images of the sheet edge were recorded as it flowed through the drawbead, then post- processed in order to analyze the strip profile and determine the minimum bend radii. Maximum bending strains were also calcu- lated from the measured radii. For each drawbead configuration investigated, experimental observations of bead wrap are presented and discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1137. (SP-1614) Controllable nitrogen cylinders for deep drawing dies. K. Siegert and D. Haller , University of Stutt- gart. A gas spring is a cylinder charged with nitrogen gas at a pressure up to 150 bars. The gas pressure acts on the piston of the spring and provides a permanent force. In the field of metal forming, nitrogen gas springs are used for bringing up high closing or clamping forces, replacing conventional springs or even hydraulic or pneumatic cush- ion systems in the table of single acting presses. State of the art is a nitrogen spring with a more or less progres- sive force over the stroke. But for deep drawing applications a decreasing force over the stroke is often needed. Furthermore it would be a great advantage to control the force of the gas spring over the stroke. Controllable nitrogen springs have been investigated at the Insti- tute for Metal Forming Technology (IFU) of the University of Stutt- gart. This paper gives an overview about the basics of the nitrogen spring technology and discusses the newly developed technology that makes it possible to control the gas spring force over the stroke. 2001-01-1138. (SP-1614) Effect of global and local stiffness on blankholder pressure in draw die forming. M. E. Dingle , Ford Motor Co.; P. D. Hodgson, Deakin Univ.; and M. J. Cardew-Hall, Australian National Univ. This work investigates the effect of elastic deformation of the press and die in a double action press on system performance during draw die forming. A simple linear elastic model of the complete press system was developed to show that the relative stiffness of system components controls blankholder force variation during the stroke. Calibration of the analytical model with data taken from a production press shows that the simple model explains real global system behavior very well; and that varying system compliances can desensitize the press system to changes affecting the binder gap dur- ing the stroke. The experimental data suggests that real press and tool systems do not have an appropriate combination of system com- pliance, which causes large variations in blankholder force during the stroke. This model will be a useful tool for die designers and pro- cess engineers for assessing the potential impact of blankholder force variation during die design. It can also be included in finite element forming simulation models. The main focus of this work is the global model, however it is important to recognize that local structural stiffness of the stamping tools also has an important effect on restraining force variation around the binders. Contact pressure contour plots generated from a finite element model of a production blankholder are used to illus- trate the significance of local structural stiffness variation. A simple model is developed to explain this result, which agrees with infor- mation available from the tryout process for that tool. 2001-01-1139. (SP-1614) Metal forming characterization and simulation of advanced high strength steels. Jody Shaw and Ming Chen, U.S. Steel Corp.; and Kenichi Watanahe, Kobe Steel Ltd. The remarkable evolution of steel technology in recent years has resulted in the development of new High-Strength Steels (HSS) that are increasingly used in today's automobiles. The advanced perfor- mance of these grades in ductility and rapid-hardening characteris- tics provides an opportunity to stamp complex geometries with in- panel material strengths far exceeding those of conventional high- strength grades of steel. This provides an opportunity to improve an automotive body's performance in crash, durability and strength while reducing the overall weight of the vehicle. An improved understanding of the forming characteristics of these advanced HSS and accurate prediction of the material-processing strain will allow vehicle designers to fully explore the opportunities of increased yield, strain hardening, formability and strength and the potential this creates to reduce mass and improve the performance of the auto- motive body. In this study, material testing is performed on five different grades of steel, including conventional mild steel, conventional HSS and several grades of advanced HSS, to establish material proper- ties, forming characteristics, springback characteristics and stamp- ing failure criteria. This data is then incorporated into a forming sim- ulation for correlation between test and simulation.

(SP-1575) Lightweight thermoplastic compos- ite throttle bodies for car and truck applications. Phil Ogren, Ganesh Padiyar, Tim Parkinson, and Michael Rabideau, Visteon Automotive Systems; and James F. Smiths on, GE Plastics. The drive to reduce weight, simplify assembly, and cut total sys- tem cost in today's vehicles is relentless. Replacing metal systems with thermoplastics has been of considerable interest in the engi- neering community. The current generations of engineering thermo- plastic resins are enabling the use of plastic systems in demanding underhood applications. Technical data and discussion regarding the materials, design, molding, and assembly of lightweight composite throttle bodies will be presented in this paper. Comparisons with machined aluminum throttle housings are drawn to establish a baseline with the throttle body housing component that is most common in production today. Design flexibility and process simplification are some of the approaches highlighted. Much of the technical information provided in the paper applies to both cable driven mechanical throttle bodies as well as electronic throttle bodies under development. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1142. (SP-1575) Performance of HT-thermoplastic spur gears made out of Polyaryletherketone (PAEK). Ralf Weidig, Victrex Europa GmbH; and Jan Rosier, Technical Univer- sity Berlin. Ongoing development trends in the automotive industry towards higher operating temperatures in many gear applications will require more heat and wear resistant polymers on top of the currently used Nylon and Poly acetal. The performance of these HT-polymers will open new opportunities to replace metal gears and contribute to weight, cost and noise reduction. Using Polyaryletherketone a wide 154</page><page sequence="154">2001-01-1142-2001-01-1156 test range has been conducted including fatigue testing under differ- ent temperatures and gear testing under dry, greased and lubricated conditions, varying speed, load and temperatures. The results indi- cate a superior performance of Polyaryetherketone gears especially under elevated temperatures and lubricated conditions. 2001-01-1144. (SP- 1575) Development of a plastic manifold noise syntheses technique. Colin Novak and Robert Gaspar, Uni- versity of Windsor ; and Steve Fletcher and Paul Daly, Siemens Automotive. The effects of engine noise in plastic manifolds has been a sub- ject of study in the automotive industry. Several SAE papers have been published on the subject. Most testing described requires access to engine dynamometers and other elaborate equipment. As part of a general study of plastic intake manifold noise characteris- tics, this study was undertaken to develop a synthesis bench for enabling low-cost noise testing of plastic induction systems includ- ing plastic manifolds. Computer simulation of engine intake noise was used as part of a correlation between the plastic manifold synthesis bench and actual engine measurements. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis provided analogous results between the predicted theoretical and two measured signals with a fundamental frequency at approximately 80 Hz. Qualitative and statistical comparisons of the time domain signals also proved equally favorable. Recommendations are included for further development of this approach. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1145. (SP-1575) Adhesives for underhood bonding.

Building automotive LIN applications. Hans-Christian von der Wense and A. J. Pohlmeyer, Motorola, Inc. As automotive electronic systems become more and more spread, the necessity for a complete portfolio of communication standards for automotive applications becomes obvious. In the low- cost Class A Smart Sensor &amp; Actuator arena Local Interconnect Network (LIN) is the top candidate to be used as a multiplex stan- dard all over the world. The LIN concept includes not only the physical layer and the data link layer; it also defines the tool interfaces and network description to speed the development process for in vehicle networks. This article describes the development process for LIN applica- tions and gives an example of a typical LIN application, explains the benefits of this solution from the major aspects, the usage of the different tool interfaces, and its representation on the data link layer and the physical layer. 2001-01-1148. (SP- 1598) A simplified close form approach, for slipping clutch thermal model. Xiaoning Xiang and John M. Kremer, BorgWarner, Inc. Transmission System Corp. The objective of this work is to generate a robust slipping-clutch model that will be employed as a component for driveline dynamic simulations. The model was mainly focused on the relatively detailed slipping-clutch interface temperature evaluation. The core reason for including interface temperature computation is to better estimate the dynamic coefficient of friction. The contribution of this work is in the development of a simplified close-form approach to solve the thermal field problem at the clutch interface. Compared with implicit numerical methods (such as the finite difference method), the close-form approach reduces the computational cost significantly. In addition, this model can be embedded in commer- cially available simulation software (such as MATLAB and EASY5) without the need to consider the numerical integration methods, which generally are a concern when implicit numerical methods are used. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1149. (SP- 1598) Transient solution of 2-D TEI prob- lem using reduced order models. Abdullah M. Al-Shabibi and James R. Barber, University of Michigan. The transient solution of a two-dimensional problem with therm- oelastic instability (TEI) has been investigated using a "reduced order model." Thermoelastic instability results from the interaction of frictional heat generation, elastic contact pressure and therm- oelastic distortion of two bodies in contact and sliding relative to each other. In practice this class of problem is encountered with the automotive brakes and clutches. The goal has been to construct a mathematical model with a few degrees of freedom that will approx- imate the real system. The method was found to work well when compared with results from FE computer simulation but involves a dramatically reduced computational time. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1153. Friction material/oil interface for slipping clutch applications. Yih-Fang Chen, Timothy Newcomb, and Rob- ert C. Lam, BorgWarner, Inc. A new successful friction material was developed to operate in the severe high-energy environment of the slipping clutch, including wet start clutch, continuous slip and limited slip applications. The new slipping material was based on the understanding of the interfa- cial phenomena occurring during the slipping operations. The result- ing friction interface (friction material and lubricant combination) possesses the necessary heat dissipation, good shudder resistance and good launch feel. Bench, dynamometer and vehicle test results are presented and the underlying interfacial phenomena are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1154. (SP- 1598) "Bump Test" of wet friction materi- als: Modeling and experiments. Wenping Zhao and Przemysław Zagrodzki, Raytech Composites, Inc. In one of the fatigue tests for wet friction materials, "bump test," an inertia-type rig equipped with a multi-disk assembly is used. One of the steel disks in the assembly has radial bumps for the purpose of creating high local contact pressure and high temperature. Due to the severe contact conditions, a comparative testing for different friction materials can be conducted within a relatively small number of cycles. In the paper, a design of a "bump" assembly used for auto- motive wet friction materials is described. Based on both experi- mental tests and advanced contact modeling, non-uniform contact pressure generated by the bumps and resulting temperature are esti- mated. The computational model is used then to study the influence of the modulus of elasticity of the friction material and reaction plate thickness on the contact conditions. The bump fatigue tests lead ulti- mately to material failure. The modes of the failure obtained during the tests are demonstrated and commented on in the paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1156. (SP- 1598) Quantification of friction compo- nent engagement controllability. Ted D. Snyder, Ford Motor Co.; and Christopher C. Denault, Borg-Warner Corp. Conventional automatic transmissions (AT) use wet friction components, such as plate clutches and band brakes to engage gears or change speed ratios during vehicle operation. The quality of engagements and ratio changes depends greatly on the frictional characteristics of the friction components, which are typically evalu- ated with industry standard SAE #2 test machines. These inertia absorption-type dynamometer test stands energize a friction compo- 155</page><page sequence="155">2001-01-1 156-2001-01-1 164 nent with prescribed level of apply force and load of inertia fly- wheels rotating at a specified speed until the friction elements are brought to a stop. During the slip, apply force, engagement torque, and rotating speed are digitally recorded for visual evaluation of dynamic engagement behavior. The shape of the dynamic torque curve during the engagement is known to affect AT shift quality. When many curves are generated, it becomes intractable to quantify torque curve shape differences. A new digital rating method is developed that allows these torque curves to be efficiently compared and differences effectively quantified. Single number ratings can be generated representing deviation of the individual curve from a pre- determined ideal shape. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1157. Research into the use of controlled surface technologies for clutch friction surfaces. Jeff Wirth , 3M Automo- tive Division.

(SP- 1598) Optimization methods for 1RS axle mount design. Yuejun E. Lee , Vince Monkaba, and Fatma Koc er, Visteon. Determination of locations and stiffness rates of Independent Rear Suspension (1RS) axle mounts is critical during the early stages of vehicle design. Depending on the vehicle, the design require- ments of 1RS axle mountings vary. Design objectives include the zero-roll condition, the static-roll condition and the dynamic-roll condition. Currently, there are no methods for 1RS axle mount design for the dynamic-roll condition. Current design methods used for the other two requirements also lack accuracy and robustness. In this paper, methods developed for 1RS axle mount design for all three objectives are explained. These methods are verified on a three-mount 1RS axle. Additionally, placing the rigid body modes at desired frequencies is achieved. Compared to the current meth- ods, the proposed methods are more accurate and robust. They could improve design quality and productivity significantly. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1159. (SP-1598) Control of the transmission ratio derivative in passenger car powertrain with CVT. Jerzy Jantos , Technical University of Opole. The continuously variable transmission (CVT) differs from the traditional automatic transmission (AT) in that it introduces an addi- tional degree of freedom - the transmission ratio derivative (TRD) - into the control system. Based on the derived equation expressing dynamics of a car with CVT, the author analysed the influence of the TRD on the drive properties. The theoretical results were veri- fied with the use of the Road Load Simulator (RLS). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1161. (SP-1598) Dynamic analysis of forces gener- ated on inner parts of a double offset constant velocity universal joint (DOJ): Non-friction analysis. Yoshihiko Hay ama, NTN Corp. The Constant Velocity Joint (CVJ) is a very important element in the automotive drive train system. There are various types of CVJs, both "fixed" and "plunging." Each CVJ consists of several parts and these move in 3-dimensions as they rotate and transmit torque. Investigations of the motion and dynamic forces generated on these parts are important in the development of a CVJ. Various experimental methods for measuring the motion and forces of a CVJ were investigated. It is very difficult to measure these parameters directly. Because of advancements in computer technology, Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) offers major advantages to the design and development of the automotive indus- try. By using CAE, it is possible to correctly investigate the motion and forces generated on CVJ internal parts. This paper describes analytical results of dynamic forces that are generated on inner parts of a type of plunging CVJ called a Double Offset Joint (DOJ) using the ADAMS dynamic modeling software. ADAMS can solve non-linear multi-body dynamic problems. Therefore, an ADAMS model can include the assembly of multiple parts. In this analysis, contacts between inner parts assume the Hertzian contact theory and friction forces are not taken into consideration. 2001-01-1162. (SP-1598) Analysis of a Fl car hydraulic cir- cuit dynamic behavior. M. Borghi, M. Milani, and M. Piraccini, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia; and M. Piandoli, Minardi Team Fl. This paper deals with the study of the dynamic behavior of a Fl car gear selection hydraulic circuit, when involved in different shift transients. In the first part of the paper the actual circuit is described, and the main hypotheses adopted for the numerical modeling of the hydraulic power unit, of the control valves, of hydraulic pipes and of the actuators involved in the gear shift cycles are introduced. Par- ticular attention is devoted to the actuators actual sequences, as applied by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to the servo-valves deputed to actuators control. The strategy to define each gear shift cycle in terms of actuators working position in time domain is cho- sen, using the frequency map of each servo-valve. A numerical versus experimental comparison of the behavior of the actuators involved in the gear selection (during about 50 ms for an up shifting and 100 ms for a down shifting) is performed, with the target to define the validity limits of the numerical model results. Finally, the paper reports the analysis of those hydraulic vari- ables not controlled by the on-board diagnostic, with the aim to ana- lyze the behavior of the power unit and of the pipes when submitted to the sudden hydraulic power request correspondent to a gear shift. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1163. (SP-1598) Analysis of the gear shift mecha- nisms by R-R chart method. Jongsool Park and Jongsun Oh, Hyundai Motor Co. A new point of view in automatic transmission is proposed by R-R chart, which is a new analytic method based on the linearity of planetary gear and gear shift mechanism. The R-R chart is a visual tool to describe the whole motion of each rotational element of plan- etary gears in relation to the gear shift mechanism. Therefore, any- one can easily find on R-R chart not only the substance of the gear shift mechanisms in present automatic transmissions but also new gear shift mechanisms for the future automatic transmissions. This paper shows that the R-R chart is unique in 4-speed automatic trans- missions with fixed compound planetary gear sets. As a result of the R-R chart application, this paper classifies the fixed compound plan- etary gear sets with 4 elements into 12 sets and the gear shift mecha- nisms into 3 types. Also, 4 R-R characteristic equations are derived as a correlation between speed ratios in 4-speed automatic transmis- sions. This paper describes systematically the gear shift mechanisms for 5-and 6-speed automatic transmission by R-R chart. Finally, this paper introduces the new gear shift mechanism for 5-speed auto- matic transmission with 3 clutches and 1 brake. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1164.

Tsutomu Fujimoto and Tomoaki Kizuka, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. To reduce the idling rattle of manual transmissions, the computer simulation has been utilized. However, the conventional simulation model could not express properly the relationship between the trans- mission oil temperature and the rattle noise level, especially in case of transmission with backlash eliminator in constant mesh gears. In this study, the authors carried out detail experiments investigating the motion of each part in the transmission.

(SP- 1601) Examination of car to light truck compatibility in frontal crashes. K. Digges and A. Eigen , George Washington Univ. In the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) routinely measures the force exerted on the rigid barrier in frontal crash tests. Thirty-six load cells on the barrier face measure the distribution of the crash forces. This study examined the load cell barrier data collected during recent years to assess the geometric distribution of the crash forces and the varia- tion in stiffness across the vehicle width. The location of the Center of Force was proposed as a metric for quantitatively describing the geometric properties of the crash forces. The Center of Force location was calculated for each column of load cells. Variations in the Center of Force location across the width of the barrier were examined for typical vehicles. This study applies the aggressiveness metric to a frontal crash from NASS/CDS 1997 in which a passenger car collided with a light truck. The damage patterns, location of damage and extent of dam- age were examined to assess the contribution of mass, geometry and stiffness incompatibilities, and their contribution to the crash sever- ity experienced by the occupants. Metrics for geometric compatibil- ity based on load cell barrier data were applied to quantify the stiff- ness and geometric differences. These metrics are summarized in the paper along with an illustrative case. Due to the large variations in the stiffness and the location of stiff points across the front of vehicles, a single metric to characterize stiffness and geometric compatibility may not be possible. 2001-01-1166. (SP-1601) Investigation of the major factors influencing front compatibility design of vehicles. Gary Brown, Eduardo Arvelo, and Anne Strong, MIRA ; and Mike Hopkins, ACS Consultancy. Many papers have been written on the influence of vehicle struc- tures interacting against each other in car-to-car accidents. Research has determined the major factors which influence occupant surviva- bility in front crashes as being: Geometric interaction; Stiffness; Mass. However, the influence of each individual factor is not well understood. Design of Experiments (DOE) techniques, of which the most generally known are those of Taguchi, can be combined with Finite Element (FE) analysis to provide a powerful tool to allow the inves- tigation and understanding of the above compatibility issues. Public domain FE models of the Ford Taurus have been used as a basis of this analysis. The preliminary results of the investigation are reported in this paper. The investigation of a number of variables within the DOE model has allowed a greater understanding of the behavior in incom- patible vehicle structures. The knowledge gained from this study will allow better design for compatibility in future crash worthiness vehicle structures. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1167. (SP-1601) NHTSA's compatibility research program update. Stephen Summers, Aloke Prasad, and William T. Hollowell, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper provides an update of NHTSA's research activities in vehicle compatibility and agressivity. This paper presents newly ini- tiated efforts underway to develop test assessment methodologies intended to evaluate vehicle compatibility. The rigid barrier load cell data collected from 18 years of the agency's New Car Assess- ment Program testing are reviewed to evaluate potential test mea- sures that may be used to evaluate a vehicle's compatibility in vehi- cle-to- vehicle crashes. These parameters are then evaluated using a series of vehicle-to- vehicle and moving deformable barrier (MDB)- to-vehicle tests. In these tests, the face of the MDB has been instru- mented with an array of load cells to compute test measures. This study is part of NHTSA's ongoing compatibility research program and is being coordinated with the IHRA compatibility group. 2001-01-1170. (SP-1601) Determining closing speed in rear impact collisions with offset and override. Jeffrey J. Croteau and Stephen M. Werner, Exponent ™ Failure Analysis Associates; and John L. Habberstad and Joseph Golliher, Origin Engineering, LLC. Considerable research has been dedicated to establishing the amount of energy absorbed during different types of collisions. In the early 1960's, motor vehicle manufacturers began conducting barrier crash tests consistent with SAE suggested procedures. This allowed investigators to establish the amount of energy that went into metal deformation in the tested vehicle. Over the years, there have been many advances in establishing the amount of crush energy in a particular accident, including the development of several computer programs. Four two-vehicle, single-moving rear-impact crash tests were conducted to compare the effect of override and offset. Override comparisons were made using a moving, rigid barrier or a heavy truck as the impactor, and each pair of tests having either offset or full rear engagement. All four tests were conducted using a like make and model four-door sedan as the target vehicle. Each test had the same available crush energy for the car. The vehicles were instrumented with triaxial accelerometers, and the tests were docu- mented with high-speed film cameras. Crush profile information is presented to compare the damage generated by the truck and moving barrier. Analyses of the stiffness characteristics of the car in the two collision types are presented. This paper focuses on methods of establishing crush energy in override and offset collisions. 2001-01-1172. (SP-1601) A systems modeling methodology for evaluation of vehicle aggressivity in the automotive accident environment. Alexandra C. Kuchar and George W. Neat, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center; and Robert Greif, Tufts Univ. A systems modeling approach is presented for assessment of harm in the automotive accident environment. The methodology is presented in general form and then applied to evaluate vehicle aggressivity in frontal crashes. The methodology consists of para- metric simulation of several controlled accident variables, with case results weighted by the relative frequency of each specific event. A hierarchy of models is proposed, consisting of a statistical model to define the accident environment and assign weighting factors for each crash situation case, and vehicle and occupant models for kine- matic simulation of crash events. Head and chest injury results obtained from simulation are converted to harm vectors, in terms of probabilistic Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) distributions based on previously defined risk analyses. These harm vectors are weighted by each case's probability as defined by the statistical model, and summed to obtain a total estimate of harm for the accident environ- ment. The methodology is applied to a subset accident environment consisting of single- and two-vehicle frontal collisions among pas- senger cars and light trucks. The model is validated against recent crash statistics, and is found to accurately reflect trends in distribu- tion of injury severity while slightly underestimating moderate to severe injuries. The model is subsequently exercised for variable sensitivity analyses, wherein the effects of light truck/car population mix are evaluated in terms of their impact on occupant harm within the subset accident environment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 157</page><page sequence="157">2001-01-1 173-2001-01-1 178 2001-01-1173. (SP-1601) Biomechanics of the patient com- partment of ambulance vehicles under crash conditions: Testing countermeasures to mitigate injury. Nadine Levick and Guohua Li, Johns Hopkins Univ.; and John Yannaccone, ARCCA Inc. There has been very limited research on the biomechanics of occupant safety in the ambulance environment. Occupant protection or crash testing safety standards for these unique vehicles are lack- ing in the United States. Recent studies have identified ambulances as high risk passenger transport vehicles. This study was conducted to identify some of the occupant safety hazards in the ambulance environment and to determine the efficacy of some countermeasures to mitigate ambulance occupant injury. Accelerator sled testing of the ambulance rear patient compartment (ambulance box or rear cabin) with Anthropomorphic Test Devices was conducted under frontal impact conditions with a target sled pulse was 26 G and 30 mph. The ambulance box was configured with instrumented and uninstrumented Anthropomorphic Test Devices positioned as in the real world environment. Two uninstrumented 95% Hybrid-II Anthropomorphic Test Devices were lap belted and positioned in the occupant compartment, one on the rear-facing attendant's seat and one on the side-facing bench seat. A Side Impact Dummy was unbelted, seated on the front of the side-facing bench seat and posi- tioned next to a passive restraint device. An instrumented Hybrid-Ill 3-year-old child Anthropomorphic Test Device was restrained in a child restraint system, secured to the gurney via a dual belt path. The actual sled pulse achieved was 34Gs and 34.34 mph, and due to sep- aration of the ambulance box from the chassis/sled, the crash pulse imparted to the patient compartment were 20Gs and 20.9 mph. Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values calculated for the restrained Hybrid- Ill child Anthropomorphic Test Device were 171, however for the unbelted Side Impact Dummy the HIC was projected to be in excess of 1000. Although this study was a preliminary study, the findings confirmed that there are unique occupant hazards in the ambulance vehicle environment and that certain restraint practices are of value and that some injury mitigating countermeasures are ineffective. Importantly this study also demonstrated the potential for unre- strained occupants to be not only a hazard to themselves but also a hazard to the restrained occupants in the ambulance patient com- partment. This study highlights the need for the development of dynamic safety standards for occupant restraint in this environment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1174. (SP-1601) Gender and age influence on fatality risk from the same physical impact determined using two-car crashes. Leonard Evans, General Motors Corporation Research &amp; Development Center; and Peter H. Gerrish, Nesa and Associates, Inc. Studies using the double-pair-comparison method found that fatality risk from the same physical impact is (28 ± 3)% greater for females than for males, and increases with age after age 20 at com- pound annual rates of (2.52 ± 0.08)% for males and (2.16 ± 0.10)% for females. The purpose of the present study is to investigate fatal- ity risk from the same physical impact versus gender and age using a different method and data distinct from those in the other studies. Female-to-male fatality risk was estimated using two-car crashes in which the gender of the two drivers differed. Fatality risk from the same impact is found to be (22 ± 9)% greater for females than for males, and to increase annually after age 20 by (2.86 ± 0.32)% for males and (2.66 ± 0.37)% for females. The relatively close quantita- tive agreement between the present and double-pair-comparison estimates increases confidence in the validity of double-pair- comparison methods and the present method. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1175. (SP-1612) Round robin study of freezing point of coolants using manual and automatic methods. G. Chiù, Phase Technology; and D. E. Turcotte, Valvoline Co. The use of ethylene glycol (EG) as engine coolant or airfield deicer has been well-established for many years. Its good thermal conductivity and easy compatibility with water to form eutectic freezing points render ethylene glycol a suitable candidate for the purpose of freeze protection. Accordingly, the determination of freezing point of aqueous EG base coolant has been part of the spec- ification required for automobile and light-duty service (eg. ASTM D3306, D4656) or for heavy duty engines (ASTM D6210, D621 1). The standard test method for measuring freezing point, as stated in the above-mentioned specifications, is ASTM Dl 177-94. It is a manual method requiring timely seeding as well as considerable operator skill and time. Other test methods such as those based on refractive index (ASTM D3321) or chemical test strips are also used but their accuracy and precision are not expected to match that of D1177. Recently automatic analysis based on direct cooling and optical detection has become available. Preliminary studies have shown the automatic test to be more precise and sensitive than its manual coun- terpart. Furthermore, the speed of analysis and ease of use of the automatic test remain attractive benefits. In view of these develop- ments, ASTM Committee D-15 on engine coolant has coordinated an inter-laboratory round-robin study to assess the automatic method with respect to D1177. The results of this study are pres- ented in this paper. A related objective of this paper is to contrast the precision of both the automatic and manual methods found in this study with that in other studies utilizing other methods (D1 177 and D3321). Hence a more comprehensive picture of the relative merits of different test methods of freezing point can be attained. 2001-01-1176. (SP-1612) A new tool for corrosion inhibitor research. Carol S. Jeffcoate, Honeywell CPG. Electrochemical techniques such as repassivation potential mea- surements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have become important tools in corrosion and corrosion inhibitor research. However, these techniques reflect the response of the total surface area of the exposed sample and cannot distinguish between types of localized corrosion, e.g., pitting or crevice corrosion. Cur- rent density mapping (CDM) is a technique that uses a fine stainless steel needle, vibrating at a set frequency and scans over the surface of a sample in a plane micrometers above the sample surface. By mapping the current distribution over a surface, sites of localized corrosion can be characterized and the effect of a corrosion inhibitor monitored. 2001-01-1177. (SP-1612) Field experience with organic acid engine coolant on silicone seals. T. R. Gallant, J. D. Smith, R. A. Rapp, K. Carpenter, and M. L. Sullivan, Cummins Inc. As new coolant technologies are developed to meet customer and engine manufacturer requirements, the effect of these new chemis- tries on polymers, e.g., seals, are often inadequately evaluated. Cur- rently, there are no specific test requirements for polymer compati- bility covered in the ASTM coolant specifications. The vulnerability of changing coolant chemistries without adequate seal compatibility testing is highlighted by recent field failures on the Cummins N14 engine. The Cummins N14 engines started to experience silicon seals leaking coolant in less than 150 K miles, whereas, these spe- cific seals had been in production for 7 years and demonstrated a million-mile life with conventional coolant chemistries. The leakage coincided with the introduction of an organic acid coolant to these engines by several truck manufacturers. This study documents the effect of coolant chemistry leading to the field failures. Laboratory and engine tests correlating to field data were developed and recom- mendations for a proposed test procedure and criteria for seal com- patibility are presented. 2001-01-1178.

Rueger and X. Jin, Federal Mogul. 158</page><page sequence="158">2001-01-1178-2001-01-1184 The increasing usage of Organic Acid Technology (OAT) cool- ants in the automotive and diesel engine markets has made it neces- sary to verify whether current engine seals are compatible with these coolants for leak-free, long life performance. Recent field failures of silicone seals on Cummins N14 and Mil diesel engines when exposed to a particular organic acid coolant has only highlighted this need. Too often, previous elastomer compatibility studies have uti- lized short-term exposures to coolants followed by measurement of typical properties such as tensile and hardness change. The results of those studies frequently have not correlated with real-world per- formance of the elastomers when used as long life engine seals. Occasionally, these simplistic compatibility studies have wrongly predicted that no compatibility problem would exist or that certain elastomers would make better coolant seals than others while excluding the evaluation of key functional parameters. This paper will present the test results of two high quality silicone coolant seal materials after exposure to fully formulated (commercial version) organic acid and conventional heavy-duty coolants, to generic organic acid and hybridized organic acid coolants and to a baseline ethylene glycol coolant solution. Evaluation techniques included standard ASTM tensile, volume and hardness test methods, but also the more application critical parameter of compression set. A variety of chemical analysis techniques were also included to elucidate the chemical effects of the coolant exposures.

(SP-1612) The effects of contaminated engine coolants on the service life of elastomers. Thomas N. Wilson and Wesley G. Co, Parker Seals. Service life of elastomers is usually evaluated in the environment in which the elastomer is required to perform. Generally, the envi- ronment is considered to be a single fluid. However, inquiries from heavy-duty and automotive OEMs regarding the cross contamina- tion of fluids in coolant systems, has been steadily increasing. Addi- tionally, numerous articles and technical bulletins have been written regarding the cross contamination of fluids. Various elastomers can be used in coolant systems; however, studies in the past have shown that the elastomers that are best for coolant systems may not be suit- able once contaminants are introduced. With the introduction of Organic Acid Technology (OAT) cool- ants and Hybrid (Conventional/OAT technology) into the automo- bile and truck markets, it has become necessary to perform elasto- mer compatibility studies to insure that seal materials will withstand the new fluids. This paper will compare Silicone (VMQ), Ethylene Propylene Terpolymer (EPDM), Hydrogenated Nitrile Rubber (HNBR), and Fluoroelastomer (FKM) rubber compound formula- tions in a conventional coolant and a Hybrid (European) coolant, diluted with engine lube oil 5%, to show the effects of oil contami- nation on the elastomers. Standard bench tests were used to conduct the evaluations. High temperature, (150°C) and low temperature (100°C) was used to measure the effects of high temperature accel- erated aging on the elastomers as well as the coolants. Additionally, this range should cover all potential operating temperatures. 2001-01-1181. (SP-1612) Standard test method for cavitation and erosion-corrosion characteristics of aluminum pumps with engine coolants. Edward R. Eaton and Scott McCracken, Amalga- tech; Mary Ranger, Ford Motor Co. ; and David Turcotte, Valvoline Co. The ASTM D 2809 test method, "Standard Test Method For Cavitation Corrosion and Erosion-Corrosion Characteristics of Alu- minum Pumps With Engine Coolants" was first published in 1969. The method involves a copper-pipe circuit through which coolant solution, heated to 1 13°C, is pumped at 103 kPa for 100 hours. The method was modified to change the pump used in the test in 1989. It was updated in 1994 to accommodate a change in the cleaning procedure and was subsequently reapproved by the ASTM D- 15 Committee on Engine Coolants in 1999. Tests recently conducted on several modern coolants have pro- duced "failing" results, but the coolants are performing well in the field. Further, the repeatability and reproducibility of the method have been questioned. A round-robin series of tests sponsored by the Ford Motor Company revealed significant variations and cause for concern. The authors herein report research, performed at Amalga- tech, that offers insight into the strengths and weakness of the method, and offers possible modifications that will improve the value of the method, offering better prediction of service experience. This paper discusses the value of the test method, offers an analy- sis of its strengths and shortcomings, and suggests possible modifi- cations to improve repeatability and reproducibility. It reviews the development of a new prototype instrument, possible future applica- tions and predictive capabilities of an updated method. 2001-01-1182. (SP-1612) A chemical base for engine coolant/ antifreeze with improved thermal stability properties. Edward R. Eaton, Amalgatech ; and William E. Boon and Chris J. Smith, Shell Chemical Co. Increasingly challenging international engine emissions reduc- tions have resulted in some advances in engine emissions technolo- gies that may motivate a change from the customary ethylene glycol and/or propylene glycol bases that have been the mainstay of engine antifreeze formulations for almost a century. The new engines' com- ponents, especially exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) devices, gener- ate much greater thermal stress on the engine coolant. The oxidation of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol may be accelerated dramati- cally, resulting in coolant unsuitable for continued use in as little as a few months. The industry has been working towards extended engine coolant service intervals, with some recommendations for service extended to as long as five years. It follows, therefore, that a requirement for coolant change at four- to six-month intervals (due to accelerated oxidation &amp; aging) would be unacceptable to vehicle owners. Coolants are generally evaluated and judged by subjecting them to a series of physical properties and performance tests, and then comparing the data to the specifications published by ASTM. This paper reports the data generated by subjecting a new coolant base chemistry, 1,3 Propanediol (PDO), to the ASTM D3306 Light and Medium Duty (Automotive) and D62 10/62 11 "Fully Formulated Engine Coolant" physical and performance testing protocols. These protocols qualify an engine coolant for use in virtually any engine cooling system, gasoline (petrol), diesel, and natural gas; engineered with or without wet sleeve cylinder liners. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1184. (SP-1612) The role of carboxylate-based cool- ants in cast iron corrosion protection. Regis J. Pellet and Leonard S. Bartley, Texaco Global Coolants; and Douglas P. Hunsicker, Caterpillar Inc. Nitrites have long been added to heavy-duty coolant to inhibit iron cylinder liner corrosion initiated by cavitation. However, in heavy-duty use, nitrites deplete from the coolant, which then must be refortified using supplemental coolant additives (SCA's). Recently, carboxylates have also been found to provide excellent cylinder liner protection in heavy-duty application. Unlike nitrites, carboxylate inhibitors deplete slowly and thus do not require contin- ual refortification with SCA's. In the present paper laboratory aging experiments shed light on the mechanism of cylinder liner protection by these inhibitors. The performance of carboxylates, nitrites and mixtures of the two inhibi- 159</page><page sequence="159">2001-01-1184-2001-01-1191 tors are compared. Results correlate well with previously published fleet data. Specifically, rapid nitrite and slow carboxylate depletion are observed. More importantly, when nitrite and carboxylates are used in combination, nitrite depletion is repressed while carboxyl- ates deplete at a very slow rate. Results show that carboxylate inhi- bition greatly assists the nitrite mechanism in cylinder liner protec- tion. Laboratory findings are supplemented with field experience. Engine tear-downs reveal excellent cylinder cavitation protection for carboxylate based coolants with nitrite. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1185. (SP-1612) Heat exchange characteristics of sili- cate and carboxylate-based coolants in air-cooled engine parts. Paul Fritz , Priscilla Selembo, and Regis Pellet , Texaco Global Products; and Savas Yavuzkurt , and Nityanath Vaidya, Pennsylva- nia State Univ. Effective heat transfer is the most important duty of an engine coolant. The heat exchange characteristics of the cooling system are primarily defined by the physical properties of the coolant, the pres- ence of coatings and air resistance. Good heat transfer properties result in lower local temperatures (reducing the risk of corrosion at heat rejecting surfaces) and allow for more efficient engine designs (less coolant is needed to achieve the same amount of heat transfer, therefore, smaller radiators, heater cores and coolant overflow bot- tles could be used). If a coating is present, it not only interferes with heat transfer by acting as an insulator, but it may also result in hot spots from the uneven heat distribution and induce localized corro- sion. This paper will compare the heat exchange characteristics of sili- cate and carboxylate-based engine coolants by measuring the rate of heat transfer in a heater core exposed to an air current. The heat transfer rates are obtained experimentally. The experimental setup consists of a heater core, a coolant heater, a coolant pump, a thermo- stat and an air blower. The experiments were run at two different coolant flow rates (1 and 2 gpm) and one air speed (1.72 m/s). The study shows that there is a 7 - 8% improvement in heat transfer rate when using a light duty carboxylate-based coolant compared to a light duty silicate-based coolant. Theoretical calculations simulated what would be the predicted change in heat transfer with different thickness of deposits using programs written in FORTRAN and FLUENT. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1186. Combustion system of a lean-burn piston engine with catalytic prechamber. Jozef Jarosiński Ryszard Lapucha , and Jacek Mazurkiewicz, Institute of Aviation; and Stanis- law Wójcicki , Washington State Univ. In the present work it is proposed to improve the efficiency of an Otto engine by development of a system with assisted catalytic ignition and combustion. The system is characterized by the use of a lean mixture in a swirling charge, substantial increase of the com- pression ratio, and application of a catalytic prechamber. For a long time, the combustion of lean mixtures has been one of the most important tendencies in development of gasoline engines. To be able to burn lean mixture at full load it is necessary to induce intense swirl in the combustion chamber and to increase compression ratio. One of the possible ways to burn lean homogeneous mixture is to use the combustion system made up of a main combustion chamber and prechamber. The latter is fed with the same lean homogenous mixture as the main combustion chamber, but it contains catalytic insert, kept at temperatures high enough, to secure catalytic reac- tions and torch ignition of the main charge. The combustion system was applied to four-cylinder diesel engine Ford FSD 425, with 2.5 1 capacity, modified to the Otto cycle. Fuel injectors in the original engine were replaced with small prechambers. Each prechamber was equipped with catalytic insert and spark plug. The geometric compression ratio of the modified engine was e = 16. A high swirl- ing ratio was preserved from the original engine. After preliminary tests and series of succeeding improvements the engine started to work in optimum conditions. The modified Otto engine reached the original level of power 46,5 kW, at 4000 RPM, and original specific fuel consumption 254 g/kWh, at 2100 RPM. It worked more than 300 h. A small prechamber with the catalytic insert attached to the engine structure improved considerably the combustion characteris- tics, thus making possible operation with lean mixtures, at high compression ratio and high efficiency. It was found in experiments that catalytic ignition either can accompany spark ignition or it can be used as independent source of ignition. In both cases it increases the fuel economy and reduces emission of CO, HC and NOx, in com- parison with pure spark ignition. 2001-01-1188. Influence of spark discharge energy on the combustion process in the engine fueled with natural gas. Kazimierz Golec, Tadeusz Papuga, and Maciej Makowski, Cracow University of Technology; and Tomasz Markiewicz, USFilter. The article reports the result of investigations of a single-cylinder engine fueled with natural gas and fitted with an Increased Dis- charge Energy (IDE) Ignition System. The aim of investigation was to describe the influence of the ignition discharge energy value on the heat release function in the natural gas-fueled engine. The paper reports the simplified functional model of ignition sys- tem with increased discharge energy. Based on changes of indicated pressure in the combustion cham- ber and by using combustion model, the heat release function in relation to the selected feeding parameters, such as Ignition Advance Angle (IAA) and Excess Air Number (EAN), was defined. The influence of ignition discharge energy on engine cycle vari- ability was also tested. The research proved the improvement of engine work parameters with increased energy of ignition spark. 2001-01-1189. Experimental investigations on the perfor- mance characteristics of a producer gas fuelled spark ignition engine. P. G. Tewari, J. P. Subrahmanyam, and M. K. Gajendra Babu, Indian Institute of Technology. Experimental investigations relating to the use of producer gas in a spark ignition engine are reported in the proposed paper. The experimental setup consists of a single-cylinder diesel engine con- verted to operate on a spark ignition engine mode coupled to a swinging field electrical dynamometer. A downdraft closed top charcoal gasifier has been used to generate the producer gas. After cooling and cleaning, it is fed to a venturi type gas carburetor, which ensures proper mixing of gas and air before it enters the engine. Testing of the converted engine was carried out under gasoline mode at a specified compression ratio. However subsequent tests on producer gas operation were performed at different compression ratios. The significant outcome of the present investigations include the satisfactory conversion of diesel engine to a spark ignition mode for neat producer gas operation and satisfactory operation of gas carbu- retor designed and developed for the purpose. The converted engine experienced a derating of about 20% on gasoline mode and 40% on producer gas operation. Brake thermal efficiencies were in the range of 24 to 28% for gasoline operation as compared to 18 to 22% for producer gas operation. Carbon monoxide emissions were less than 1% by volume and hydrocarbon emission were negligible through- out the entire load operations at all engines speeds and compression ratios. The cyclic variations in peak cylinder gas pressure were observed to be higher for producer gas-operated engine as compared to the gasoline version. It is anticipated that the present studies could pave the way for the exploration of developing producer gas- operated engines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1191. Experimental investigation of fuel consump- tion and exhaust emissions of a 16V pent-roof engine fueled by gasoline and CNG. A. E. Catania, S. d'Ambrosio, A. Mittica, and E. Spessa, Politecnico di Torino. 160</page><page sequence="160">2001-01-1191-2001-01-1199 A systematic experimental investigation was undertaken to com- pare the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of a production SI engine fueled by either gasoline or compressed natural gas (CNG). The investigation was carried out on a two-liter, four-cylinder engine featuring a fast-burn, pent-roof chamber, one centrally located spark plug, four valves per cylinder and variable intake- system geometry. The engine was originally designed at Fiat to operate with unleaded gasoline and was then converted at Politec- nico di Torino to run on CNG. A Magneti Marelli IAW electronic module for injection-duration and spark-advance setting was used to obtain a carefully controlled multipoint sequential injection for both fuels. Besides the design features and the air-fuel control sys- tem, which are of particular interest for natural gas operation due to the lack of data on their combined application to CNG vehicles, the relatively high compression ratio approximately equivalent to 10.5, that is almost suitable for natural gas fueling, makes the engine attractive for bi-fuel operation, i.e., the capability of running on either CNG or gasoline, where operation with natural gas is usually compromised. The engine was operated with gasoline and natural gas under steady-state conditions at four different speeds and loads. MBT spark timing and stoichiometric air-fuel ratio were used fist. Then for each point in the speed and load matrix, tests were carried out both as "spark sweeps" centered on MBT spark advance and as "RAFR sweeps" around stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. At each test with both fuels, the engine performance analysis was carried out in terms of specific fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. An upgraded multipurpose exhaust-gas analyzer, including a device to separate methane from non-methane HC pollutants, was used for emission quantity measurements. The effect of engine variables on fuel conversion efficiency and exhaust emissions was thoroughly investigated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1193. Feasibility study of an online gasoline fraction- ating system for use in spark-ignition engines. Aaron Oakley , Hua Zhao , and Nicos Ladommatos, Brunei Univ.; and Tom Ma, Ford Motor Co. A fuel fractionating system is designed and commissioned to separate standard gasoline fuel into two components by evaporation. The system is installed on a Ricardo E6 single-cylinder research engine for testing purposes. Laboratory tests are carried out to determine the Research Octane Number (RON) and Motoring Octane Number (MON) of both fuel fractions. Further tests are carried out to characterize Spark-Ignition (SI) and Controlled Auto-Ignition (CAI) combustion under border- line knock conditions, and these are related to results from some pri- mary reference fuels. SI results indicate that an increase in compression ratio of up to 1.0 may be achieved, along with better charge ignitability if this sys- tem is used with a stratified charge combustion regime. CAI results show that the two fuels exhibit similar knock-resistances over a range of operating conditions. 2001-01-1194. Influences of gas quality on a natural gas engine. Jan Czerwiński and Pierre Comte , University of Applied Sciences. The topic of investigation of this work was the influence of dif- ferent gas qualities on the engine parameters and particularly on the air excess factor. For this research the normalized gases with extreme compositions were used. At stationary operation there are no differences of the leaning capability of the different gases. The gas with the highest content of inert components causes the lowest full load power, the highest fuel consumption and the highest cyclic irregularity. With the same air flow and the same injection duration for differ- ent gases result different air excess factors X according to the density and to the necessary stoichiometric air quantity of each gas. This fact influences the X at transient operation conditions as: cold start- ing, gas quality jump, or load increase, if there is no ^-control. With an active ^-control, which is today fast enough, especially with an adaptive system there are no problems with ^-differences. 2001-01-1195. Emissions performance of bi-fuel CNG and bi- fuel LPG passenger cars using sequential multi-point injection systems. Andy Stodart and Ian Aitchison, Cosworth Technology Ltd.; and John Lapetz, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes a study into the emissions performance of a passenger car running on natural gas and liquid petroleum gas. The gasoline engine was modified to allow the introduction of the alter- native fuels into the engine. The effect of fuel system hardware on emissions was investigated. Modifications were carried out to the gasoline EMS to allow control of the alternative fuel systems. A number of changes were made to the gasoline calibration to allow operation on the alternative fuels. Emissions tests were conducted on commercial grade natural gas and liquid petroleum gas. The results were compared with gasoline emission results of an equiva- lent vehicle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1197. Methanol combustion in low compression ratio D.I. engines enabled by Sonex piston design. David A. Blank and Andrew A. Pouring, Sonex Research, Inc.; and Jiang Lu, Con- sultant. Using methanol as a fuel, this study examines the chemical- kinetics mechanism responsible for the enhancement of combustion in I.C. engines due to intermediate and radical chemical species pro- duced in micro-chambers of Sonex Combustion System (SCS) pis- tons. This homogeneous combustion enhancement was first shown experimentally (in 1991) to be capable of enabling an IC engine to operate stably and smoke free on methanol over an entire engine map while using a compression ratio of only 17:1 and without a spark or other assists. The distinction is made between thermally induced variants of homogeneous combustion: HCCI and AT AC; and intermediate species/radical induced homogeneous combustion: LAG and SCRI (Stratified Charge Radical Ignition). In order to determine the kinetic mechanisms responsible for the intermediate and radical species enhanced combustion of methanol and of similar enhancements with other fuels, the present study explores the effects of several important species on the numerically simulated methanol combustion. A detailed chemical kinetics approach is adopted using CHEMKIN-II and integrated with axi-symmetric turbulent combus- tion KIVA-II flow-field calculations. Results point conclusively to the importance of the dominant effects of two intermediate species formed and retained in frozen equilibrium (inactive at lower pres- sures and temperatures) in the SCS micro-chamber along with the importance of one "frozen" radical specie. These dominant species are shown to enhance ignition by changing the oxidative chain initi- ation paths, thus reducing the ignition delay time. The end outcome is a faster, more complete and lower temperature combustion pro- cess that results in "ultra-clean" exhaust gases. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1199. (SP- 1584) Localization of knock events in direct injection gasoline engines. H. Philipp, A. Hirsch, M. Baum- gartner, G. Fernitz , C. Be idi, W. Piock, and E. Winklhofe r, AVL-List GmbH. The exploitation of full load capabilities of DI gasoline engines requires at least the same degree of effort as in MPFI engine devel- opment. An optics-based sensor and sensing technique is presented, which together with conventional pressure indicating provides iden- tification of self-ignition centers as the engine is operated under knock or borderline knock conditions. The knock location sensor is configured as a spark plug providing the relevant spark plug proper- ties together with the multichannel optical access into the upper part of the combustion chamber. Functionality and sensitivity of this sensing technique are demonstrated and results for combustion sys- tem development are shown. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 161</page><page sequence="161">2001-01-1200-2001-01-1205 2001-01-1200. (SP-1584) Spark plugs for gasoline direct injection engines. Naomichi Miyashita, Yoshihiro Matsubara, Kazuya Iwata, and Masahiro Ishikawa, NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd. The direct-injection (DI) gasoline engine has drawn considerable attention recently for energy savings and emission reductions. Compared with current port fuel injection (PFI) engines, DI engines are designed to have high specific power output, low fuel consumption and low emissions at the same time. Among others a feature of the DI gasoline engine is its capability to freely alter the state of combustion from homogeneous to stratified combustion at different load conditions. Engines with high power density such as the DI engine, are also prone to knock. To suppress engine knocking a flexible and precise combustion control mechanism is required. The paper being presented describes some of the characteristics required for spark plugs utilized in DI gasoline engines. The unique features are: the firing point is set slightly deeper in the combustion chamber; the plug has increased temperature resistance; the fuel mixture is stratified for low and medium engine speeds; and the plug has anti-carbon fouling properties with self-cleaning capability. The paper presents details on the spark plugs developed for DI gasoline engine applications including the performance and experi- mental results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1201. (SP-1584) Development of new concept irid- ium plug. Ken Hanashi, Yasutake Ishino, and Hironori Osamura, Denso Corp.; and Katsushi Hashizume, Toyota Motor Corp. In the field of automotive gasoline engines, new products aiming at greater fuel economy and cleaner exhaust gases are under devel- opment with the aim of preventing environmental destruction. Severe ignition environments such as lean combustion, stronger charge motion, and large quantities of EGR require ever greater combustion stability. In an effort to meet these requirements, an irid- ium plug has been developed that achieves high ignitability and long service life through reduction of its diameter, using a highly wear- resistant iridium alloy as the center electrode. Recently, direct-injection engines have attracted attention. In stratified combustion, a feature of the direct-injection engine, the introduction of rich air-fuel mixtures in the vicinity of the plug igni- tion region tends to cause carbon fouling. This necessitates plug car- bon fouling resistance. Success was achieved in developing a new concept iridium plug that dramatically improves carbon fouling resistance while preserv- ing long service life and high ignitability found in conventional plugs. This paper consists of the four chapters that follow describing the newly developed product.

(SP-1584) A review of fuel, intake and combus- tion system deposit issues relevant to 4-stroke gasoline direct fuel injection engines. Paul W. Guthrie, Siemens Automotive AG. The recent emergence of production Gasoline Direct Fuel Injec- tion (GDFI) engines into the world markets offers the promise of both improved fuel economy and emissions for 4-stroke Spark Igni- tion (SI) engines. However with all new technologies there are new challenges that accompany them. The subjects of fuel and intake system and combustion chamber deposits in Port Fuel Injected (PFI) SI engines are well researched and documented. Today only a small amount of specific research exists for GDFI engines. In any case, based on available PFI deposit literature it is possible to make a number of observations about the likely GDFI fuel and intake system deposit issues and their effect on fuel econ- omy, exhaust emissions and performance during a lifetime of service. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1203. (SP-1584) Piston wetting in an optical DISI engine: Fuel films, pool fires, and soot generation. Eric Stevens and Richard Steeper, Sandia National Laboratories. Piston-wetting effects are investigated in an optical direct- injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. Fuel spray impingement on the piston leads to the formation of fuel films, which are visualized with a laser-induced fluores-cence (LIF) imaging technique. Oxy- gen quenching is found to reduce the fluorescence yield from liquid gasoline. Fuel films that exist during combustion of the premixed charge ignite to create piston-top pool fires. These fires are charac- terized using direct flame imaging. Soot produced by the pool fires is imaged using laser elastic scattering and is found to persist throughout the exhaust stroke, implying that piston-top pool fires are a likely source of engine-out particulate emissions for DISI engines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1204. (SP-1584) Liquid film evaporation off the pis- ton of a direct injection gasoline engine. Terrence Alger, Yiqun Huang, Matthew Hall, and Ronald D. Matthews, University of Texas. An optical access engine was used to image the liquid film evap- oration off the piston of a simulated direct injected gasoline engine. A directional injector probe was used to inject liquid fuel (gasoline, i-octane and n-pentane) directly onto the piston of an engine primar- ily fueled on propane. The engine was run at idle conditions (750 RPM and closed throttle) and at the Ford World Wide Mapping Point (1500 RPM and 262 kPa BMEP). Mie scattering images show the liquid exiting the injector probe as a stream and directly impact- ing the piston top. Schlieren imaging was used to show the fuel vaporizing off the piston top late in the expansion stroke and during the exhaust stroke. Previous emissions tests showed that the pres- ence of liquid fuel on in-cylinder surfaces increases engine-out hydrocarbon emissions. Fuel injector shutoff tests using a wide- range lambda sensor and the Fast-Spec system demonstrated that the effect of the liquid fuel was seen for several cycles after liquid fuel injection was terminated. Combining these hydrocarbon emissions data with the images from a geometrically similar optical engine showed that the evaporation of liquid fuel from in-cylinder surfaces is a slow process, much of which occurs after the in-cylinder gas temperature has dropped below that required for post-flame oxidation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1205. (SP-1584) The effects of fuel volatility and structure on HC emissions from piston wetting in DISI engines. Yiqun Huang, Terry Alger, Ron Matthews, and Janet Ellzey, Univer- sity of Texas. Piston wetting can be isolated from the other sources of HC emissions from DISI engines by operating the engine predominantly on a gaseous fuel and using an injector probe to impact a small amount of liquid fuel on the piston top. This results in a marked increase in HC emissions. All of our prior tests with the injector probe used California Phase 2 reformulated gasoline as the liquid fuel. In the present study, a variety of pure liquid hydrocarbon fuels are used to examine the influence of fuel volatility and structure. Additionally, the exhaust hydrocarbons are speciated to differentiate between the emissions resulting from the gaseous fuel and those resulting from the liquid fuel. It is shown that the HC emissions cor- respond to the Leidenfrost effect: fuels with very low boiling points yield high HCs and those with a boiling point near or above the pis- ton temperature produce much lower HCs. As expected, there is a significant effect of fuel structure for fuels that have the same boil- ing point. For fuels with the same boiling point, the primary effect of structure appears to be its effect on unburned fuel emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 162</page><page sequence="162">2001-01-1206-2001-01-121 1 2001-01-1206. (SP-1584) Influence of ethanol content in gaso- line on speciated emissions from a direct-injection stratified charge SI engine. Hakan Sandquist, Maria Karlsson, and Ingemar Denbratt, Chalmers University of Technology. The influence of ethanol content in gasoline on speciated emis- sions from a direct-injection stratified charge (DISC) SI engine is assessed. The engine tested is a commercial DISC one that has a wall-guided combustion system. The emissions were analyzed using both Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and conven- tional emission measurement equipment. Seven fuels were compared in the study. The first range of fuels was of alkylate type, designed to have 0, 5, 10 and 15 % ethanol in gasoline without changing the evaporation curve. European emis- sions certification fuel was tested, with and without 5% ethanol, and finally a specially blended high volatility gasoline was also tested. The measurements were conducted at part-load, where the combus- tion is in stratified mode. The engine used a series engine control unit (ECU) that regulated the fuel injection, ignition and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). A low concentration of ethanol in a commercial gasoline does not alter significantly the operational characteristics of the DISC engine tested. The engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are prac- tically unchanged, while the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions decrease when 5% ethanol is added. The tailpipe HC, CO and nitro- gen oxides (NOx) emissions are virtually unchanged for the fuel with 5% ethanol. However, for the alkylate fuels there was a ten- dency towards increased engine-out and tailpipe HC emissions with increased ethanol content. Aldehyde emissions, which could be measured only for the alkylate fuels, increased slightly when ethanol was added. Stratified charge aldehyde emissions were 2 - 3 times higher than for homogeneous charge operation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1207. (SP-1584) Internal mixture formation and combustion - From gasoline to ethanol. C. Stan , R. Troeger, S. Guenther, and A. Stanciu, West Saxon University of Zwickau; and L. Martorano , C. Tarantino , and R. Lensi, University of Pisa. The fuel direct injection in SI engines is demonstrating a remark- able potential regarding the reduction of consumption and pollutant emission. Nevertheless, the management of the mixture formation "in-cylinder" - in conditions of a short duration and of a complex fluid dynamic configuration imposes both an accurate modeling and an exact control of the process. The problem gains on complexity when considering the use of alternative fuels which becomes more and more a subject of actual- ity. The paper presents a comparative analysis of mixture formation process and engine performances, when applying direct injection of gasoline, respectively of ethanol in a four-stroke single-cylinder SI engine. The modulation of the injection rate shape is the result of a fuel high pressure wave, generated in a pressure pulse direct- injection system. The internal mixture formation is modeled in base on the CFD code FLUENT, allowing the analysis of the space- and time-related process sequences for both fuels, using different parameter combi- nations for injection system and engine. The comparison of both fuels at the test bench of the injection system is made for different injection volumes, injection frequencies and injector opening pressures. A spray visualization for the most representative configurations is presented as well. Finally, the engine results at the test bench confirm the good adaptability of the applied direct injection concept for both gasoline and ethanol application. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1208. A low-cost modular small-engine system utiliz- ing extruded aluminum. Peter Savage , Evan Bydder, and Peter Witehira , Power Beat International Limited. The use of modularized aluminum extrusions for the block, crankcase and head in small-engine systems allows a range of engines to be mass produced without resort to casting for the station- ary components. The use of modern accurately dimensioned extru- sions greatly reduces the machining required. The versatility and strength of extruded aluminum alloys enables the elimination of load-bearing threads and most other finish machining, thus signifi- cantly reducing the labor costs of manufacture. A range of strokes and hence of different capacity engines can be produced from a sin- gle extrusion form. For extended life, bores can be coated with a variety of finishes, including simple anodizing. Extrusion technol- ogy allows cost-effective engines to be manufactured with a signifi- cantly lower investment than with other technologies. 2001-01-1209. Study of the noise characteristics of motorcy- cle silencers. Jesus Blanco, Advanced Analysis Ltd.; and Andrew Earnshaw, Triumph Designs Ltd. This paper describes methodologies developed to reduce the noise radiated from silencers while keeping or improving engine performance; i.e. whilst minimizing the pressure loss through the silencer. This work was successfully developed to help motorcycle designers to meet the current legal noise limitations with minimum detriment to engine performance. Innovative designs for reactive silencers have resulted, with improved acoustic and engine perfor- mance levels, compared with traditional systems. The methodology was developed using the boundary element method (BEM). This method is able to calculate the acoustic vari- ables in the interior and exterior fluid of the silencer. Furthermore, it is possible to simulate the temperature gradient along the silencer. A further important characteristic of the method is the ability to sim- ulate the proper boundary conditions at the outlet without the need of hand calculations or "guesses." 2001-01-1210. Use of predictive analysis to optimize the design of a novel cylinder head cooling arrangement. Matthew Woods, Advanced Analysis Limited; and Andrew Earnshaw, Tri- umph Designs Limited. A new retro-styled air-cooled DOHC parallel twin motorcycle engine was being designed with performance on par with modern standards. The use of a central cam chain drive between the two cylinders was required, which eliminated the possibility of incorporating air- cooling passages through the center of the cylinder head. Therefore to increase the cylinder head cooling, the design engineers decided to use strategic oil cooling in the critical areas of the head. Preliminary analysis of the conceptual design indicated potential thermally induced problems. This initiated an intensive program of predictive analysis with close liaison between the analysts, design- ers and manufacturers to create an optimized design. The first physi- cal prototype matched all predicted targets reliably in less than six months from the original conceptual design. This paper describes the approach adopted for the analysis work, and describes some of the methodologies used to produce reliable results within the necessary tight time scales during both initial con- cept and subsequent detailed design stages. 2001-01-1211. Evolution of intake design for a small engine formula vehicle. Badih A. Jawad, Amelia L. Lounsbery, and Jeffrey P. Hoste, Lawrence Technological Univ. To obtain a maximum range for usable torque, Helmholtz theory is utilized to tune an Honda CBR 600 cc engine. The design objec- tives were to: 1) Increase performance by reducing pressure losses in the entire intake system; 2) Maximize the restrictor's design to increase airflow at lower pressure drops; 3) Improve throttle response through throttle body design and reduction of turbulence when full open; 4) Utilize runner design to improve tuning effects as predicted by Helmholtz resonance theory and; 5) Incorporate a plenum design with equal air distribution to all four cylinders. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 163</page><page sequence="163">2001-01-1213-2001-01-1222 2001-01-1213. An investigation of the intake manifold fuel transfer characteristics of a four-stroke engine. Sebastian Strauss and Jay K. Martin, University of Wisconsin. A single-cylinder air-cooled four-stroke engine was modified with a fuel injection system in place of the main carburetor jet, giv- ing direct control over the fuel flow into the intake manifold. The engine was run with constant air mass flow at constant engine speed and throttle position. Step changes in the injector pulse width, result- ing in changes of the metered air-fuel ratio from 17 to 1 1, were run with two different injector configurations at different steady state throttle positions. The temporal dependence of the exhaust air-fuel ratio during these perturbation transients was measured with a fast- response Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor and ana- lyzed with a 2-parameter t-x fuel flow model to estimate the real- time in-cylinder air-fuel ratio and extract the intake manifold fuel transfer parameters. Pictures of the fuel sprays were taken. The two different injector configurations showed different fuel spray and metering characteris- tics. The results showed significantly different wall film deposition characteristics for larger throttle openings for the two injector ver- sions, whereas they were similar for small throttle positions. Higher fuel wall film quantities did not result in an increased cyclic vari- ability of the air-fuel ratio. The data suggest that the engine air-fuel ratio variability is more influenced by fuel metering variability than by wall film effects. The UEGO sensor response characteristics were determined using propane-induced intake air-fuel ratio step changes. The sensor response time was observed to be significantly different for the two cases of increasing and decreasing air-fuel ratio and dependent on throttle position for increasing air-fuel ratios. 2001-01-1214. The transient response and estimation of the air-fuel ratio variability of a carbureted four-stroke engine. Sebastian Strauss and Jay K. Martin, University of Wisconsin. A carbureted, single-cylinder air-cooled four-stroke engine was subjected to a variety of throttle transients at various steady state air- fuel ratios between 11 and 17. The changes in throttle position occurred over 2 to 10 engine cycles. Opening and closing throttle transients were run and the exhaust air-fuel ratio was measured with a fast response Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen (UEGO) sensor. The air-fuel ratio response showed a complex behavior, with lean and rich excursions for both opening and closing transients. The excur- sions were more severe for leaner air fuel ratios and went beyond the lean firing limit for some transients. Engine speed was not found to have a significant influence on the observed air-fuel ratio excur- sions. A response simulation for the UEGO sensor was used to esti- mate the engine air-fuel ratio variability from the measured data. The actual COV of air-fuel ratio is estimated to be about 2.5 times higher than the measured value. 2001-01-1218. (SP-1586) Sophisticated CAN on embedded microcontrollers for smart in- vehicle real-time control systems. Shigeo Uno, Naoyuki Hirayama, Akihiko Watanabe, and Fumio Tsuchiya, Hitachi Ltd. In the past 10 years there have been a drastic evolution in car electronics. Most mechanically operated systems as like an engine control for example has switched to an electronic system to have more precise method to control the system and in some cases more cost effective. Due to the implementation of electronically con- trolled systems more and more information could be handled within these systems, and with more and more information there is a turn- ing point that there is a large benefit to have a common use of the information. Now in-vehicle network is playing a major part in car electronics. CAN is one of the most popular candidate for real-time communications between the systems This paper will describes the development concept of our new CAN module for embedded microcontrollers targeting automotive applications. Currently CAN has been used as one of the most popu- lar control network systems. Due to expansion of data transactions via CAN, data handling by the module or by the controller has been a major subject. We have developed a method to handle the large amount of data with the least CPU (Central Processing Unit) over- head to provide maximum performance of the CPU. This will be shown with a simulation result in comparison of the new CAN mod- ule and the conventional CAN module, along with an example to show the efficiency in a application such as ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) system. And furthermore this new CAN module will have the capability to cooperate with the latest requirements of the CAN specification such as the time triggered CAN of the ISO standard. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1220. (SP-1586) Smart IGBT for advanced ignition systems. Claus Preuschoff, Infineon Technologies AG. Increasing fuel costs and emission regulations force the car man- ufacturers to develop powerful but efficient engines. The 3-liter car (3-liter/100 km fuel consumption -» 80 miles/gallon) is one of the slogans. To fulfill these requirements a fully electronic-controlled Engine Management is necessary. Carburetor systems are replaced by fuel injection systems. Direct injection for diesel as well as for gasoline engines is the clear trend for the future. The mechanical throttle systems, used for a long time will not fit to the requirements of direct injection. A DC motor for electronic throttle control in conjunction with X regulations and exhaust gas recirculation are the key elements for low emission cars. Also the automotive ignition system is in a process of change today. Coming from distributor systems, which were substituted by distributorless ignitions systems with double spark coils, we are fac- ing today single coil systems like 'coil on plug' or 'pencil coils' and ion current measurement for knock detection. This SAE paper will discuss the new requirements and introduce a Smart Ignition IGBT from Infineon Technologies as a solution. 2001-01-1221. (SP-1586) Effective system development parti- tioning. Patrick Leteinturier, Infineon Technologies AG; and Guenter Gromeier and Johannes Wagner, ETAS GmbH. In terms of modern technical systems, the automotive sector is characterized by escalating complexity and functionality require- ments. The development of embedded control systems has to meet highest demands regarding process-, time- and cost-optimization. Hence, the efficiency of software development becomes a crucial competitive advantage. Systems design engineers need effective tools and methods to achieve exemplary speed and productivity within the development phase. To obtain such tools and methods, semiconductor manufacturers and tool manufacturers must work closely together. Within the joint efforts of ETAS and Infineon, the software tool suite ASCET-SD was enhanced to generate efficient C code for Infineon' s TriCore architecture mapped on ETAS 's real- time operating system ERCOSek. The processor interface to appli- cation &amp; calibration tools was realized using the ETK probe based on a JTAG/Nexus link at very high bandwidth. 2001-01-1222. (SP-1586) A new calibration system for the DaimlerChrysler medium- and heavy-duty diesel engines - An exercise in methods and tools. Reinhard Ludes, AFT Atlas Fahrzeugtechnik GmbH; and Peter Ebel, DaimlerChrysler AG. High demands in fuel consumption, efficiency, and low emis- sions lead to complex control functions for current and future diesel engine management systems. Great effort is necessary for their opti- mal calibration. At the same time, and particularly for cost reasons, many variants exist on one individual type of diesel engine management system. Not only is it used for several base engines, but these engines are also used in different environments and for different tasks. For opti- mal deployment, their calibration status must also be optimized indi- vidually. 164</page><page sequence="164">2001-01-1222-2001-01-1230 Furthermore, the demand for shorter development cycles and enhanced quality lead to a catalogue of new requirements for the calibration process and the affiliated tool. A new calibration system was developed, which optimally reflects the new demands. The paper here provides an overview of how these new demands have been met, starting with the initial requirements of enhanced data management, reproducibility and quality assurance, safety and better ergonomics. Also shown is how the new international AS AM/ ASAP standards have been implemented creating crucial interfaces for an open system. The results section summarizes the benefits, which have arisen for the everyday calibration process, as well as for new approaches in the development, calibration and validation processes, which have not been feasible before. 2001-01-1223. (SP- 1586) A new approach for the validation of engine management strategies specifications through simula- tion algorithms. Rosanna Bray, Massimo Carignano, Cesare Gior- dano, and Francesco Pastorelli, Fiat Research Centre. The increased complexity of the electronic control systems requires exhaustive debugging algorithms. In this paper a validation methodology for the engine management strategies specifications is described. It is based on mathematical simulation and testing using finite state machine (FSM) integrated in an engine model. Consider- ing the strategies management built with states and transitions dia- grams, a simulation environment has been developed where a two- ECU (Electronic Control Unit) system is clocked with parallelism. Advantage consists of debug time reduction in the validation and software testing. This paper presents an efficient and exhaustive method to create specifications in terms of FSM and tasks scheduling. 2001-01-1224. (SP-1586) Rapid prototyping with the Control- ler Area Network (CAN). Yasser Yacoub and Alain Chevalier, Ford Research Lab. Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP) tools are becoming an essential part of the development process of modern automotive control strat- egies. The interface between the RCP real-time hardware and the existing electronic control unit (ECU) can be established via Con- troller Area Network (CAN). In a typical production ECU, the lim- ited availability of unused message objects and the rate of data trans- fer on the CAN bus are limiting factors which influence the mecha- nism used for communication between the ECU and the RCP sys- tem. This document outlines the details involved in a CAN-based selective bypass approach. A data transfer mechanism is proposed which makes use of only two message objects to establish communi- cation. The introduced time delays and the synchronization of the time-driven main tasks are discussed. The proposed mechanism is validated through engine testing and the implementation details are described as well. A standard realization of the proposed mechanism is presented based on the CAN Calibration Protocol (CCP) standard. The CAN-based approach to RCP is shown to be a viable alternative to a Dual Port RAM (DPRAM)-based approach, especially in light of the fact that the hardware flexibility is maintained when the origi- nal ECU is being upgraded. 2001-01-1225. (SP- 1604) A deforming droplet model for fuel spray in direct-injection gasoline engines. Makoto Nagaoka and Kiyomi Kawamura, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc. A three-dimensional numerical model has been developed to pre- dict spray formation process of swirl or slit type injectors which are currently used in direct-injection gasoline engines. The Discrete Droplet Model (DDM) is totally enhanced: a new droplet deforma- tion model is developed, which is theoretically introduced with a spheroidal shape assumption. The droplet drag model and droplet break-up model via Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabil- ities are modified taken into account with the deformation. The break-up model parameters are dynamically changed according to a droplet Weber number. The model functions are developed using single droplet break-up measurement data. A liquid sheet injection and break-up models are incorporated into the DDM. A new parcel radius model is also introduced to get rid of the grid dependence of the droplet collision-coalescence model. The present submodels are more general because there are no special model constants and boundary conditions to be changed according to ambient conditions. The calculations of swirl and fan sprays are compared with the measurements. The swirl spray angle decreasing under high ambient pressure, which is difficult for conventional models to predict, is simulated very well in the calculations. The good agreement is also obtained for the fan spray formation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1226. Influence of mixture fluctuations on combus- tion in direct injection spark ignition engines simulations. J. Hélie, J. M. Duelos, and T. Baritaud, IFP ; T. Poinsot, CERF ACS/ IM FT; and A. Trouvé, George Washington Univ. Modelling small and large scale fluctuations of fuel distribution is of high interest for stratified direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines. Homogeneous combustion models need to be extended or replaced in order to account for these fluctuations. They are pres- ently neglected in most engine simulations. Effects of mean fuel/air equivalence ratio gradient have been recently included in previous homogeneous mixture approaches. To account for local fluctuations of mixture composition, the new model ECFM-Z has been developed on the basis of recent Direct Numerical Simulation results and Coherent Flame Surface modelling. The model has been implemented in a CFD code (KMB). The influence of mixture fraction is integrated in the Extended Coherent Rame Surface combustion model. The model is based on a conditional approach. Unburnt hydrocarbons produced by lean flame local extinctions are taken into account. The model ECFM-Z is applied to investigate mixture fluctuation effects in a wide spacing, DISI engine running under stratified oper- ating conditions. A typical stratified combustion parameter, the igni- tion timing, is varied. Accounting for the local fluctuations in mix- ture composition modifies heat release estimation. Effects of partial quenching and mass burning rate modelling on the combustion effi- ciency are revealed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1228. (SP- 1604) Multi-dimensional modeling of mix- ing and combustion of a two-stroke direct-injection spark igni- tion engine. Li Fan and Rolf D. Reitz, University of Wisconsin. Multi-dimensional modeling was carried out for a Mercury Marine two-stroke DISI engine. Recently developed spray, ignition, and combustion models were applied to medium-load cases with an air-fuel ratio of 30:1. Three injection timings, 271, 291 and 306 ATDC were selected to investigate the effects of the injection timing on mixture formation, ignition and combustion. The results indicate that at this particular load condition, earlier injection timing allows more fuel to evaporate. However, because the fuel penetrates further toward the piston, a leaner mixture is created near the spark plug; thus, a slower ignition process with a weaker ignition kernel was found for the SOI 271 ATDC case. The measured and computed combustion results such as average in-cylinder pressure and NOx are in good agreements. The later injection case produces lower NOx emission and higher CO emission; this is due to poor mixing and is in agreement with experimental measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1230. (SP- 1604) Air/fuel distribution simulation in a port injected gasoline lean-burn engine. N. Ishikawa, A. Hiraide, and T. Takabayashi, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. In this paper, both numerical and experimental results of in- cylinder mixture distribution are presented, and predictions agree with measured data very well. With the simulation technique described herein, mixture ignitability in a port-injection gasoline lean-burn engine can be satisfactorily evaluated based on predicted 165</page><page sequence="165">2001-01-1230-2001-01-1237 in-cylinder mixture stratification. The validation of the simulation technique can be divided into three stages. First, calculation results of in-cylinder flows are compared with measured data from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Second, the accuracy of spray calculations is verified by comparing with spray measure- ments inside an atmospheric pressure bomb. Finally, the validated simulation technique is used to model engine intake and compres- sion strokes with fuel injection. As a result, predicted results of mix- ture distribution immediately prior to ignition show a good tendency to match fuel vapor concentration distribution measured by Laser- Induced Fluorescence (LIF) in an optically accessed engine. Then, the validated simulation technique is further utilized to analyze mix- ture stratification mechanisms due to injection timing variations and intake port shapes. A good correlation is found between the pre- dicted in-cylinder mixture distribution and the variation coefficient (covariance) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) obtained from engine test. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1231. (SP- 1604) Characteristics of vaporizing con- tinuous multi-component fuel sprays in a port fuel injection gas- oline engine. Guang-Sheng Zhu and Rolf D . Reitz, University of Wisconsin; Jun Xin, Honda R&amp;D Americas , Inc. ; and Toru Taka- bayashi , Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Vaporization models for continuous multi-component liquid sprays and liquid wall films are presented using a continuous ther- modynamics formulation. The models were implemented in the KIVA3V-Release 2.0 code. The models are first applied to clarify the characteristics of vaporizing continuous multi-component liquid wall films and liquid drops, and then applied to numerically analyze a practical continuous multi-component fuel - gasoline behavior in a 4- val ve port fuel injection (PFI) gasoline engine under warm con- ditions. Corresponding computations with single-component fuels are also performed and presented for comparison purposes. As com- pared to the results of its single-component counterpart, the vaporiz- ing continuous multi-component fuel drop displays a larger vapor- ization rate initially and a smaller vaporization rate as it becomes more and more dominated by heavy species. It is found that the con- tinuous multi-component model reasonably predicts the vaporiza- tion characteristics of wall films, while the vaporization predicted with single-component models shows an intrinsic binary behavior as the wall temperature is increased around the boiling temperature of the fuel. It is shown that, although the flow and vapor distribution behaviors in PFI engines are generally similar to each other for both single-and multi-component fuels for the present warm engine case, the multi-component nature of the fuel has a significant influence on the time-space distributions of the air-fuel-ratio (AFR). The engine results also suggest that it is critical to use a multi-component vaporization model for correctly predicting and analyzing PFI engine cold-start performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1235. A simplified model for the spatial distribution of temperature in a motored DI diesel engine. D. T. Hountalas and E. G. Pariotis, National Technical University of Athens. The purpose of this paper is to present an alternative method to predict the temperature and flow field in a motored internal combus- tion engine with bowl in piston. For the fluid flow it is used a phe- nomenological model which is coupled to a computational fluid dynamic method to solve the energy conservation equation and therefore the temperature field. The proposed method has the advan- tage of simplicity and low computational time. The computational procedure solves the energy conservation equation by a finite vol- ume method, using a simplified air motion model (estimating axial and radial velocities) to calculate the flow field. The finite volume discretization employs the implicit temporal and hybrid central upwind spatial differencing. The grid used contracts and expands following the piston motion, and the number of nodes in the direc- tion of piston motion vary depending on the crank angle. The mean cylinder pressure, the local temperature distribution and the flow field are calculated at each crank angle. Experiments have been con- ducted in our Laboratory, on a DI diesel engine with bowl in piston at various speeds and the experimental compression curve is com- pared with the theoretical one. A very good agreement between the predicted and the experimental cylinder pressure is observed. The results obtained provide information concerning the distribution of gas temperature and gas velocity. The current model can be used either to examine the combustion mechanism in homogeneous charge engines or it can be combined with a jet model to develop a sophisticated but always simple model for the air-fuel mixing mechanism. This allow us to examine the combustion and pollutant formation mechanisms on an engine cycle basis, which is extremely difficult when using sophisticated CFD models. Thus the current proposal seems to be a compromise between detailed CFD models and sophisticated multi-zone phenomenological ones, offering the advantage of low computational time and examining in a more fun- damental way compared to the phenomenological models the vari- ous processes taking place inside the engine cylinder. In the present work are presented the results of the first step which is necessary before expanding the analysis to describe the fired part of the engine as well. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1236. Computational study of joint effects of shear, compression and swirl on flow and turbulence in a valveless pis- ton-cylinder assembly. S. Jakirlić and C. Tropea, Darmstadt Uni- versity Technology; and I. Hadzić, H. Pascal, and K. Hanajalić, Delft University of Technology. The potential of single-point turbulence closure models for pre- dicting the flow aerodynamics and turbulence in internal combus- tion engines (IC) was investigated by computational study of ideal- ized valveless piston/cylinder configurations. The main flow cases considered are the swirling flow in a single-stroke rapid compres- sion machine (RCM) with flat and bowl-shaped cylinder head, as well as cyclic compression. Although still remote from a real engine, these configurations enable to analyze joint effects of major phenomena governing the aerodynamics in IC engines: shear, sepa- ration, swirl and compression/expansion. Prior to the computation of these engine-like flows, an extensive validation of applied turbu- lence models was performed in homogeneous and wall-bounded shear flows, each featuring separately rotation, swirl and mean flow compression effects. A second-moment (Reynolds-stress) closure model with low-Re-number and near-wall modifications, validated earlier in a variety of generic flows, was consistently applied to all cases considered. The basis for the analysis is a set of dedicated experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS), which were performed in parallel for some of the configuration considered. In addition, other experimental results found in the literature were also used for model validation. Results of computational modeling show that the time-dependent, low-Re-number second-moment closure is capable of predicting the flow and turbulence dynamics in most cases considered, well in accord with the experimental and DNS data. In contrast, the results obtained with eddy-viscosity models, which are generally used in industrial computations, show in most cases poor quality. Some fundamental deficiencies of the latter mod- els, related to engine flows, are also discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1237. Diesel engine cold-start combustion instability and control strategy. Zhiping Han, Naeim Henein, and Bogdan Nitu, Wayne State Univ.; and Walter Bryzik, U. S. Army TARDEC. Combustion instability and white smoke emissions are serious problems during cold starting of diesel engines. In this investigation, a model has been applied to predict misfiring based on an analysis of the autoignition process. The effect of injection timing on com- bustion instability during the cold start transient, at different ambi- ent temperatures is investigated, both theoretically and experimen- tally. Maps have been developed to show the zones where misfiring would occur. The experimental work was conducted on a direct injection heavy-duty diesel engine in a cold room. The room tem- 166</page><page sequence="166">2001-01-1237-2001-01-1244 perature covered a range from 21°C to -10°C. The cycle-by-cycle data analysis was made and results plotted on the developed maps. The experimental results correlated fairly well with the model pre- diction. Based on the analysis, a new strategy for cold starting can be developed to reduce combustion instability and white smoke emissions. 2001-01-1238. Predictions of on-engine efficiency for the radial turbine of a pulse turbocharged engine. Xiao Hu and Pat- rick B. Lawless , Purdue Univ. Modern pulse-turbocharged systems produce a turbine operating environment that is dominated by unsteady flow. Effective utiliza- tion of the unsteady exhaust gas energy content at the turbine inlet is critical to achieving optimum system efficiency. This work pres- ents predictions for turbocharger unsteady performance from a model based on the Euler equations with source terms (EEST). This approach allows the time-accurate performance of the turbine to be determined, allowing comparisons of actual energy utilization and that estimated from steady flow performance maps. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1239. Combustion modeling of soot reduction in die- sel and alternate fuels using CHEMKIN®. Daniel T. Daly , Lubri- zol Corp.; and Pratyush Nag , Pennsylvania State Univ. A new gas phase kinetic model using Westbrook' s gas phase n-heptane model and Frenklach' s soot model was constructed. This model was then used to predict the impact on PAH formation as an indices of soot formation on ethanol/diesel fuel blends. The results were then compared to soot levels measured by various researchers. The ignition delay characteristics of ethanol were validated against experimental results in the literature. In this paper the results of the model and the comparison with experimental results will be dis- cussed along with implications on the method of incorporation of additives and alternative fuels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1240. Analysis of diesel spray structure by using a hybrid model of TAB breakup model and vortex method. Jung-Kuk Yeom} Koichi Ashida, Jiro Senda , and Hajime Fujimoto, Doshisha Univ.; and Tomohisa Dan, Kobe University of Mercantile Marine. We propose a hybrid model which consists of a modified TAB (Taylor Analogy Breakup) model and DVM (Discrete Vortex Method), for numerically analyzing evaporation spray phenomena in diesel engines. In the present approach, the simulation process of the hybrid model is divided into three steps. In the first step, the droplet breakup of injected fuel is analyzed by using the modified TAB model. In the second step, spray evaporation is calculated based on the theory of Siebers' liquid length. The liquid length anal- ysis of injected fuel is used for connecting both modified TAB model and DVM. Both ambient gas flow and inner vortex flow of injected fuel is finally analyzed by using DVM. An experiment on evaporative free spray at early stage of injection under in-cy linder like conditions was conducted in order to examine an accuracy of the present hybrid model. The calculated results on gas jet flow by DVM well agree with the experimental results not only qualitatively but also quantitatively for the downstream flow of evaporative spray. Both calculated and experimental results also confirmed that the ambient gas flow dominates the downstream region flow in die- sel spray. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1241. Diesel engine transient operation with turbo- charger compressor surging. G. Theotokatos and N. P. Kyrtatos, National Technical University of Athens. The transient operation of a diesel engine when the turbocharger compressor is driven to its unstable region was examined though detailed simulation. This was accomplished by using a mathematical model, capable of predicting the behavior of a compression system including the case where compressor surging occurs. This model was tested for a simple compression system, and validated against available experimental data. After that, it was incorporated into a detailed reciprocating engine simulation code. Transient engine operation cases in which compressor surging occurred were simu- lated and the derived results for the behavior of the compressor and engine are presented. 2001-01-1242. Event-based mean-value modeling of DI diesel engines for controller design. Urs Christen, Ford Motor Co.; and Katie J. Vantine and Nick Collings, University of Cambridge. Models often use time rather than strokes (crank-angle) as the independent variable to describe engine dynamics despite the fact that the dynamics of an internal combustion engine are intrinsically linked to the combustion events. In this paper, two models are devel- oped in parallel in which not only the independent variable is changed but the notion of mass flows as well: flows are in [g/s] for the time-based model and in [g/s] for the event-based model. Both models are of the same computational complexity and show the same accuracy in validation. The investigation of the model proper- ties shows that variations in the flow-related parameters are reduced by a factor of two to five for the event-based model. However, those of the crankshaft dynamics are increased. It is concluded that the model should be chosen in context of the control system to be designed. For engine speed controllers, the time-based model should be used while for applications involving flow, e.g., EGR and VGT controllers, or if the controller is to be implemented with a constant sampling angle rather than sampling time, the event-based model is preferred. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1243. Combustion and exhaust gas modeling of a common-rail diesel engine - An approach. D. D. Torkzadeh, W. Längst, and U. Kiencke, University of Karlsruhe. Engine models are a basis for better controlling combustion pro- cess and the exhaust emissions resulting from it. Currently the zero- and quasi-dimensional models are mostly used. These types of mod- els are also addressed in this article. Zero-dimensional models are computationally efficient and show good simulation results con- cerning the in-cylinder pressure. However, by neglecting multi- zonal resolution they are not able to describe fuel efficiency or the generation of pollutants. It is therefore necessary to enhance com- bustion process models with phenomenological fuel spray and vaporization models, with a local resolution of at least two zones. The chemical model for the calculating of emissions shall be based on a two-zone model. The amount of mass, which is trans- ferred from the unburned to the burned zone, is entered into a chemi- cal model based on the chemical equilibrium for the OCH (oxygen/ carbon/hydrogen) system. The result is the total quantity of chemi- cal components in the burned zone. 2001-01-1244. The reverse engineering of a turbocharged diesel engine through a unified systems approach. George J. Delagrammatikas and Dennis N. Assanis, University of Michigan. The need for a rigorous systems engineering approach to auto- motive powertrains has been addressed in this work from the per- spective of the diesel engine. A high-fidelity engine simulation has been integrated with a total vehicle model for the purpose of reverse engineering the optimal powerplant for a given vehicle mission. Engine parameters have been coordinated between the simulations to develop a framework for total vehicle design. The design strate- gies discussed in this paper allow engine researchers to set targets for individual system components and to analyze the tradeoffs asso- ciated with different vehicle mission objectives. A detailed case study employing these techniques is presented for a conventional vehicle where the most fuel-efficient engine is found that simulta- neously conforms to the desired performance criteria. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 167</page><page sequence="167">2001-01-1245-2001-01-1249 2001-01-1245. A simulation model for the combustion pro- cess of natural gas engines with pilot diesel fuel as an ignition source. D. T. Hountalas and R. G. Papagiannakis, National Techni- cal University of Athens. During the last years, a great deal of efforts have been made to reduce pollutant emissions from Direct Injection Diesel Engines. The use of gaseous fuel as a supplement for liquid diesel fuel seems to be one solution towards these efforts. One of the fuels used is nat- ural gas, which has a relatively high auto-ignition temperature and moreover it is an economical and clean burning fuel. The high auto- ignition temperature of natural gas is a serious advantage against other gaseous fuels since the compression ratio of most conventional diesel engines can be maintained. The main aspiration from the usage of dual fuel (liquid and gaseous one) combustion systems, is the reduction of particulate emissions. In the present work are given results of a theoretical investigation using a model developed for the simulation of gaseous fuel combustion processes in Dual Fuel Engines. The model is a two-zone combustion one, taking into account details of diesel fuel spray formation and mixing with the surrounding gas, which is a mixture of air and natural gas. The natu- ral gas burning initiates after the ignition of the diesel fuel. The com- bustion rate of natural gas depends on the rate of entrainment of sur- rounding gas into the fuel jet formed and on the velocity of the flame front, which is formed around the area of the burning zone and spreads inside the combustion chamber. The flame front, which is used in the present work, takes into account the history of pressure and temperature values inside the chamber and the local composi- tion to estimate the flame velocity. The model is applied on a single cylinder test engine located at the author's laboratory at various operating conditions. The engine performance under normal diesel operation is used as basis for evaluating engine performance and emissions when using gaseous fuel. The engine load is controlled by changing the amount of the primary gaseous fuel added to the intake air, while the quantity of the pilot liquid fuel per injection stroke is fixed for the given engine regardless of engine operating conditions. It is examined the effect of gaseous fuel quantity (load) on engine performance and emissions at various operating condi- tions. From the results it is revealed a change of the heat release mechanism when compared to standard diesel operation, an increase of maximum combustion pressure and an increase of NO emissions especially at high engine load. On the other hand soot emissions are considerably reduced and become negligible. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1246. Multi-zone DI diesel spray combustion model for cycle simulation studies of engine performance and emis- sions. Dohoy Jung and Dennis N. As s anis, University of Michigan. A quasi-dimensional, multi-zone, direct injection (DI) diesel combustion model has been developed and implemented in a full cycle simulation of a turbocharged engine. The combustion model accounts for transient fuel spray evolution, fuel-air mixing, ignition, combustion and NO and soot pollutant formation. In the model, the fuel spray is divided into a number of zones, which are treated as open systems. While mass and energy equations are solved for each zone, a simplified momentum conservation equation is used to cal- culate the amount of air entrained into each zone. Details of the DI spray, combustion model and its implementation into the cycle sim- ulation of Assanis and Hey wood are described in this paper. The model is validated with experimental data obtained in a constant volume chamber and engines. First, predictions of spray penetration and spray angle are validated against measurements in a pressurized constant volume chamber. Subsequently, predictions of heat release rate, as well as NO and soot emissions are compared with experi- mental data obtained from representative heavy-duty, turbocharged diesel engines. It is demonstrated that the model can predict the rate of heat release and engine performance with high fidelity. However, additional effort is required to enhance the fidelity of NO and soot predictions across a wide range of operating conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1247. Effect of variable geometry turbine (VGT) on diesel engine and vehicle system transient response. Zoran Filipi , Yongsheng Wang, and Dennis Assanis, University of Michigan. Variable geometry turbines (VGT) are of particular interest to advanced diesel powertrains for future conventional trucks, since they can dramatically improve system transient response to sudden changes in speed and load, characteristic of automotive applications. VGT systems are also viewed as the key enabler for the application of the EGR system for reduction of heavy-duty diesel emissions. This paper applies an artificial neural network methodology to VGT modeling in order to enable representation of the VGT characteris- tics for any blade (nozzle) position. Following validation of the ANN model of the baseline, fixed geometry turbine, the VGT model is integrated with the diesel engine system. The latter is linked to the driveline and the vehicle dynamics module to form a complete, high-fidelity vehicle simulation. A virtual Class VI vehicle is tested during hard acceleration and over a complete highway driving cycle in order to evaluate the effect of VGT on engine-in- vehicle response and cycle parameters affecting fuel economy and emissions. 2001-01-1248.

Blight, Airtex Products Ltd. Electric coolant pumps for IC engines are under development by a number of suppliers. They offer packaging and flexibility benefits to vehicle manufacturers. Their full potential will not be realized, however, unless an integrated approach is taken to the entire cooling system. The paper describes such a system comprising an advanced elec- tric pump with the necessary flow controls and a supervisory strat- egy running on an automotive microprocessor. The hardware and control strategy are described together with the simulation devel- oped to allow its calibration and validation before fitting in a B/C class European passenger car. Simulation results are presented which show the system to be controllable and responsive to deliver optimum fuel consumption, emissions and driver comfort. 2001-01-1249. (SP- 161 3) Experimental study of heat transfer from the heated rib-roughed wall to a steady or pulsating flow. Wojciech Jarosiński, Institute of Motor Transport. The heat exchanger performance is mostly limited by the poor gas side heat transfer. This motivates attempts to increase the effec- tiveness of gas side heat transfer processes in numerous types of heat exchangers in automotive industry mostly used for cooling. The efficiency of compact heat exchangers can be improved by means of boundary layer modification. The objective of this reported work is to study the mechanism of convective heat transfer from the heated wall of a duct to a flow of air. The surface of the heated wall is flat or rib-roughened. Rib-roughened surfaces are used to induce turbulence and to enhance the heat transfer. Interferometer, Schlie- ren and PIV methods assisted by high-speed video camera are used to study the mechanism of heat transfer from the heated wall to the flow. These methods are accompanied by measurements of the flow velocity, instant temperature, turbulence and frequency analysis of turbulence parameters. The range of Reynolds numbers studied was from 1000 to 12000. Finally the influence of a steady, oscillatory and pulsating flow on the heat transfer is investigated and compared. The low frequency oscillations from 0.083 to 0.25 Hz are applied in experiments to be comparable with frequencies used in literature. Frequencies of the pulsating flow are used in the range from 0.2 to 5 Hz. The results are presented in a form of a time-averaged Nusselt number as a function of a Reynolds number calculated on the basis of the oscillatory and pulsating flow parameters. It is found that tur- bulence promoters on the heated wall enhance heat transfer, while low frequency pulsation of the mean flow deteriorates it. Both effects are explained by the processes in the boundary layer sticking to the heated wall of the investigated channel. 168</page><page sequence="168">2001-01-1251-2001-01-1256 2001-01-1251. (SP-1613) Performance prediction of a lami- nate evaporator with hydrocarbon refrigerants as the working fluids. Gursaran Mathur, Valeo Climate Control Performance of a laminate (plate type) evaporator is simulated by using hydrocarbons as the alternative refrigerants. The perfor- mance of the evaporator is simulated with Propane (R-290), Isobu- tane (R-600a), and 50/50 mixture (by weight) of Propane and Isobu- tane. The performance is compared to a system with R-134a as the working fluid. For a given cooling capacity, the refrigerant mass flow rates for hydrocarbon refrigerants are significantly lower than R-134a. However, the heat transfer coefficients are comparable in magnitudes to the base case (R-134a) which results in heat transfer rates that are very close to that of the base case. Hence, the simulated rate of heat transfer for hydrocarbon refrigerants is very close (within -3.5%) to that of R-134a system. From experiment's point of view the rate of heat transfer are same for all 4 refrigerants. The simulated thermal performance has been compared with the experi- mental test data obtained from the system bench. The simulated per- formance is within ±12% of the experimental data. Thermal and hydrodynamic performance data along with design considerations have been presented in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1252. (SP-1613) Water condensate retention and "wet" fin performance in automotive evaporators. Chao A. Zhang and Huey Hu, Visteon Corp.; and Anthony M. Jacobi and James M. Kaiser, University of Illinois. Water condensate retained inside an automotive evaporator has remained as one of the primary sources of unpleasant "odors," which in turn can drive up the warranty cost for automotive manu- facturers. The "wet" evaporator fin can also underperform due to the presence of condensate blocking the air passage. Moreover, conden- sate retention can be a potential factor of freezing up evaporators. Thus, an evaporator fin must be designed such that it can shed and drain water condensate as well as provide an excellent heat transfer capability. While the importance of water retention is well known, there seems lacking of a comprehensive way to evaluate the water reten- tion characteristics of a particular product. In this work, attempts were made to answer four questions: (1) What is the mechanism that controls water condensate retention characteristics in an automotive evaporator? (2) Can different water retention evaluation methods reveal the same characteristics? (3) How and to what extent can an evaporator fin underperform due to water retention? and (4) Can we design a "better" fin to alleviate the problem? Clearly, any conclu- sive solutions to these challenges can lead to an efficient and more compact evaporator design, which will then be the key of cutting cost while delivering superior product performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1253. (SP-1613) Development of quad-layer clad brazing sheet for drawn cup type evaporators: Part 1. Toshihiko Fukuda and Hiroshi Ikeda, Sumitomo Light Metal Industries, Ltd.; and Yoshiharu Hasegawa and Toshiya Nagasawa, Denso Corp. Having a light weight, a good heat conductivity and a good brazability, aluminum alloy is widely used for automotive heat exchanger systems. The major problem with aluminum is perfora- tion of the tube by pitting corrosion and corrosion protection is nec- essary in the field. In radiator and condenser systems using the the Nocolok brazing process given good corrosion resistance using cathodic protection with sacrificial anode made of Zn- sprayed onto tube or low corrosion potential fins etc. On the other hand, in drawn- cup-type evaporators, that are fabricated from brazing sheet tubes in vacuum brazing method and then covered low electro-conductive drain water film in operation, the effect of cathodic protection by the anode fin is limited to a very small area. Therefore, this has been studied to improve self-corrosion resistance of the core in the braz- ing sheet tube. As the results of these problems, tube thickness of a drawn cup evaporator been remained from two to three times thicker than that of a radiator and a condenser. In order to achieve downsizing of a drawn cup evaporator, the quad-layer brazing sheet tube, that has a sacrificial anode layer between an outside solder layer and a core layer was studied. This paper describes the basic study of the mate- rial development and the next paper describes its actual use. Using some accelerated corrosion tests, the quad-layer brazing sheet tube had successful corrosion resistance. Besides the corrosion tests, basic electrochemical measurements and galvanic coupled corrosion tests were carried out as well. These results suggested that the bal- ance of corrosion potential among core alloy, sacrificial anode alloy and outer solder alloy was important to get good cathodic protection effect for the longest duration. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1254. (SP-1613) Development of quad-layer clad brazing sheet for drawn cup type evaporator: Part 2. Toshiya Nagasawa and Yoshiharu Hasegawa, Denso Corp.; and Hiroshi Ikeda and Toshihiko Fukuda, Sumitomo Light Metal Industries, Ltd. We have achieved significant weight reduction for the MS (Multi-Tank Super Slim Structure) Evaporator currently in produc- tion at Denso Corporation. The evaporator of HVAC unit, located in the instrument panel, is a component of the aluminum heat exchanger used in automotive air conditioners. The new evaporator uses thinner quad-layer sheet material, thanks to optimization of the electrical potential among its outer filler metal, intermediate anodic layer and core. The evaporator is thus lighter than conventional evaporators, but retains equivalent corrosion resistance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1255. (SP-1580) The effect of fuel-vapor concentra- tion on the process of initial combustion and soot formation in a DI diesel engine using LII and LIEF. Dae Choi, Makoto Iwa- muro, Yuta Shima, Jiro Senda, and Hajime Fujimoto, Doshisha Univ. A phenomenological or empirical model based on experimental results obtained from various optical measurements is critical for the understanding of DI diesel combustion phenomena as well as for the improvement of its emission characteristics. Such a model could be realized by the application of advanced optical measurement, which is able to isolate a particular phenomenon amongst complicated physical and chemical interactions, to a DI diesel combustion field. The authors have conducted experimental studies to clarify the com- bustion characteristics of unsteady turbulent diffusion flames in relation to the soot formation and oxidation process in a small-sized DI diesel engine. In the present study, the effect of fuel vapor con- centration on the process of early combustion and soot formation has been investigated using several optical measurements. Laser- induced incandescence (LII), which is the most effective way to visualize soot particles, has been used to obtain the 2-D distribution of soot particles in a sooting field. Furthermore, planar laser-induced exciplex fluorescence (LIEF), which is based on application of the TMPD/naphthalene excited-complex system, has been applied to simultaneous visualization of the liquid and vapor phases of the fuel jet in a DI diesel engine. The experimental results present the effect of fuel vapor distribution on the initial soot formation process subse- quent to autoignition in addition to its spatial dependence. The detailed experimental results obtained are presented and discussed in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1256.

CRT looks promising in achieving clean diesel emission particu- larly PM, however, it presents two limits in exhaust gas temperature levels, i.e., at idling to low power region requiring emission temper- 169</page><page sequence="169">2001-01-1256-2001-01-1263 ature 260°C minimum, and at high power region 450°C maximum. These problems can only be solved by the proposed method under the currently available known technologies. At the lower power side, 260° C minimum, can be materialized by the use of "Exhaust Secondary Cam (ESC)," throttling intake air and exhaust gas lines together with other means like reduction of number of cylinders in operation. At the high power side, 450°C maximum, will easily be cleared by "Hyperbrid supercharging system" invented by the author. 2001-01-1257. (SP-1580) Combustion system development in a small bore HSDI diesel engine for low fuel consuming car. Buom-Sik Shin , Myung-Seok Lyu, Chang-Ho Kim , and Kyu-Hoon Choi , Hyundai Motor Co. As CO2 emissions from vehicles is gaining a global attention the low-fuel-consuming powertrain is in much greater demand than before. Some alternatives are suggested but the HSDI diesel engine would be the most realistic solution. Vehicle simulation shows that low fuel consuming car can be realized by applying 1~1.2L HSDI diesel engine in vehicles weighing about 750kg. While the direct injection diesel engine has been researched for a long time enhance- ment of mixing between air and fuel in a limited space makes it chal- lenging area to develop a small swept volume HSDI diesel engine. We are investigating small HSDI diesel engine combustion technol- ogies as an effort to realize low-fuel-consuming vehicle. Our main objective in this study is to have a better understanding of the com- bustion related parameters from such a small size HSDI diesel engine in order to improve engine performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1258. (SP-1580) Nanometric particle formation in optically accessible diesel engine. F. E. Cordone , S. S. Merola, and B. M. Vaglieco, Istituto Motori - CNR. In the last years, there has been an increasing concern on the emission of ultrafine particles in the atmosphere. A detailed study of formation and oxidation of these particles in the environment of the diesel cylinder presents many experimental difficulties due to the high temperatures, pressures and extremely reactive intermedi- ate species. In this paper, in order to follow the different phases of diesel combustion process, high temporal and spatial resolution optical techniques were applied in the optically accessible chamber of die- sel engine, at 2000 rpm and A/F=80:l and 60:1. Simultaneous extinction, scattering and flame chemiluminescence measurements from UV to visible were carried out, in order to study the diesel combustion process from the droplet ignition to the formation of soot, through the growth of its precursors. These species were char- acterized as carbonaceous nanometric structures and their sizes were evaluated by scattering/extinction ratio according the Rayleigh theory. 2001-01-1259. (SP-1580) Time-resolved behavior of unburned hydrocarbon components in diesel exhaust under transient operations. Khandoker Abu Raihan , Fumito Takimoto, Hideyuki Ogawa, and Noboru Miyamoto , Hokkaido Univ. Time-resolved changes in unburned hydrocarbon emissions and their components were investigated in a DI diesel engine with a spe- cially developed gas sampling system and gas chromatography. The tested transient operations include starting and increasing loads. At start-up with high equivalence ratios the total hydrocarbon (THC) at first increased, and after a maximum gradually decreased to reach a steady-state value. Reducing the equivalence ratio of the high fuel- ing at start-up and shortening the high fueling duration are effective to reduce THC emissions as long as sufficient startability is main- tained. Lower hydrocarbons, mainly C1-C8, were the dominant components of the THC and mainly determined the THC behavior in the transient operations while the proportion of hydrocarbon (HC) components did not significantly change. The unregulated toxic sub- stances, 1,3 butadiene and benzene were detected in small quantities. 2001-01-1260.

This paper discusses the role that lubricant volatility plays in the generation of particulate and other regulated emissions from diesel engines and presents a new technique for continuously controlling oil volatility and thereby reducing visible smoke, particulates, car- bon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. Test results are presented that indicate that a major reduction in particulate emissions can be attained through the elimination, by continuous evaporation, of light lubricating oil fractions. The effects of treatment temperature on regulated emissions are detailed through a series of single cylinder engine tests. The results of in-service vehicle trials are presented and indicate 40-50% reductions in visible smoke in snap idle tests and reductions in regulated emissions on a number of other test cycles. Monitoring of oil characteristics in the long-term trial indicates that critical oil characteristics are maintained for longer periods than that of control vehicles' oil. 2001-01-1262. (SP-1580) Detailed chemical kinetic modeling of diesel spray combustion with oxygenated fuels. Takaaki Kita- mura, Takayuki Ito, Jiro Senda, and Hajime Fujimoto, Doshisha Univ. This paper confirms a structure for the soot formation process inside a burning diesel jet plume of oxygenated fuels. An explana- tion of how the soot formation process changes by the use of oxy- genated fuel in comparison with that for using a conventional diesel fuel, and why oxygenated fuel drastically suppresses the soot forma- tion has been derived from the chemical kinetic analysis. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism, which is combined with various pro- posed chemical kinetic models including normal paraffinic hydro- carbon oxidation, oxygenated hydrocarbon oxidation, and poly- aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation, was developed in the pres- ent study. The calculated results are presented to elucidate the influ- ence of fuel mixture composition and fuel structure, especially relat- ing to oxygenated fuels, on PAH formation. The analysis also provides a new insight into the initial soot formation process inside a diesel flame sheath in light of the temperature realm of PAH formation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1263. (SP-1580) Parametric study of the availability balance in an internal combustion engine cylinder. Dimitrios C. Kyritsis, Yale Univ.; and Constantinos D. Rakopoulos, National Technical University Of Athens. The current work uses a method developed by the authors for both combustion irreversibility and working medium availability computations in a high speed, naturally aspirated, four stroke, inter- nal combustion engine cylinder. The objective of the study was to extrapolate already published results of the second-law analysis of diesel engine operation by studying parametrically the effect of main operating parameters such as engine speed of rotation, injec- tion timing, and fuel composition. Extensive experimental data were available for the case of dodecane injection, which were used for the determination of the fuel reaction rate. Computationally, the same 170</page><page sequence="170">2001-01-1263-2001-01-1272 reaction rates were used for methane and methanol injection. The production rate of irreversibility during combustion was analytically calculated as a function of the fuel reaction rate with the combined use of first- and second-law arguments and a chemical equilibrium hypothesis. Also, the differential variation of working medium availability is computed throughout the engine cycle. Both of these quantities can be integrated during the cycle to yield a total "com- bustion loss" and the exhaust gas availability. The "combustion loss" is a measure of the entropy created during combustion, which cannot be revealed by first-law analysis. It can be used to test theo- retical expectations, e.g., that limited cooling can increase efficiency and that the decomposition of lighter molecules (CH4, CH3OH) would create less entropy increase compared to the heavier fuel case (C12H26). Also, the exhaust gas availability contains more informa- tion than its enthalpy counterpart as far as the possible operation of exhaust gas heat recovery devices is concerned. Such devices include exhaust gas turbines and Rankine bottoming cycles and are restricted in their operation by second-law arguments in a manner that cannot be evaluated by first-law analysis. 2001-01-1266.

(SP-1600) The COANDA flow control and Newtonian concept approach to achieve drag reduction of pas- senger vehicle. Jung Do Kee, Moo-Sang Kim , and Byung-Cheon Lee, Hyundai Motor Co. In order to reduce total drag during aerodynamic optimization process of the passenger vehicle, induced drag should be minimized and pressure drag should be decreased by means of applying stream- lined body shape. The reduction of wake area could decrease pres- sure drag, which was generated by boundary layer separation. The induced drag caused by rear axle lift and C-pillar vortex can be reduced by the employing of trunk lid edge and kick-up or an opti- mized rear spoiler. When a rear spoiler or kick-up shape was installed on the rear end of a sedan vehicle, drag was reduced but the wake area became larger. This contradiction cannot be explained by simply using Bernoulli's principle with equal transit or longer path theory. Newtonian explanation with COANDA effect is adopted to explain this phenomenon. The relationships among COANDA effect, down wash, C-pillar vortex, rear axle lift and induced drag are explained. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1268. (SP-1600) Quantifying platoon fuel savings: 1999 field experiments. Mark Michaelian and Fred Browand, Uni- versity of Southern California. The results reported are from tests on July 6-8, 1999, on a limit- ed-access 12km section of I -15 in San Diego. The tests involved 2, 3 and 4-car platoons operated and maintained by PATH personnel under the auspices of CALTRANS and utilized Buick LeSabre sedans under fully automatic longitudinal and lateral control. Multi- ple sensor data was acquired, including the fuel injector pulse width. We demonstrate that the fuel injector pulse width, in combina- tion with engine RPM and forward speed, can be used to determine accurate estimates of instantaneous fuel consumption. The repeata- bility for total fuel consumed over a 2.4 km portion of the test path is ±1% based upon multiple single car runs over the three day period, with the major portion of the uncertainty arising from chang- ing wind conditions. Fuel savings for individual vehicles vary from 0-10% depending upon number of vehicles, vehicle spacing, and vehicle position within the platoon. Fuel savings increase with additional vehicles, and with shortened vehicle spacings. Interior vehicles gain the great- est benefits - consistent with the decreases in aerodynamic drag seen in previous wind tunnel tests (Zabat, et al., 1995a,b). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1269. (SP-1600) On the aerodynamic loading and deformation of convertible car roofs. J. J. Knight and A. D. Lucey, University of Warwick ; and C. T. Shaw , University of Otago. Convertible vehicle hoods are known to deform away from their designated showroom shape as a result of aerodynamic loading. The ultimate aim of the work is to produce a computer-based methodol- ogy to model the fluid- structure interaction over a convertible vehi- cle hood. To develop an appropriate flow-structure coupling meth- odology, steady-state computations have been carried out for a two- dimensional model geometry. A commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package is used to calculate the pressure on the model roof. This CFD package is coupled to an in-house structural code that models the structural mechanics of the flexible roof. Fur- thermore, a very rapid hybrid means of generating the aerodynamic loading is developed because the multiple solutions required in a complete wall-flow iteration procedure can be computationally very expensive. Solutions generated using the modeling concepts have been compared with wind-tunnel testing on a physical model. 2001-01-1270. (SP-1600) Aerodynamic evaluation on For- mula SAE vehicles. Badih A.

Thinwall injection molding for instrument panels. Chris Slaviero, Kurt Weiss, and Daniel Woodman, GE Plas- tics. As the global auto industry wrote the final chapter on its first cen- tury, we saw the average thickness of an automotive instrument panel drop from 3.0 mm-3.5 mm to 2.0 mm-2.3 mm, as found in the 1999 Volkswagen Jetta and Golf. By reducing the wall thickness of the instrument panel, Volkswagen started an industry trend: both OEMs and tiers are investigating technologies to produce parts that combine a lower cost-per-part via material optimization and cycle- time reduction with the superior performance of engineering ther- moplastics. The goal is to produce parts that are positioned more competitively at every stage of the development cycle - from design, to manufacturing, to assembly, to "curb appeal" on the showroom floor. The key to this manufacturing and design "sweet spot" is a tech- nology called thinwall - the molding of plastic parts from engineer- ing thermoplastics with wall thicknesses thinner than conventional parts of similar geometry. The actual cutoff in thickness will vary 171</page><page sequence="171">2001-01-1272-2001-01-1281 based on a number of variables, including the size and flow length of the part. Automotive designers and manufacturers are starting to explore the potential of thinwall technology as a cost-reducing processing method that enables faster cycle times and lighter- weight parts using less material. The potential benefits of thinwall go far beyond the ability to produce smaller, lighter- weight, thermoplastic parts. While it is tempting to assign a thickness at which there is a transition from standard wall to thinwall, the actual cutoff will vary with the size and flow length of the part. The methodology of thinwall technology can be applied at any thickness. This paper will focus on key design development tools used to facilitate the development of low-cost thinwall instrument panel systems utilizing high performance engineering resins. 2001-01-1273. Predicting material processing degradation. Dan Woodman , Jaya Das, and Sanjay Patel, GE Plastics. As the need for plastic components with high-performance and low systems cost continues to escalate, the issues associated with bringing applications to automotive market have become more com- plex. Automotive applications such as seamless integral Passive Supplemental Inflatable Restraint (PSIR) systems can have tear- seams that are either molded-in or laser scored. Molded-in tear- seams in seamless Instrument Panels (IP) eliminate the secondary operation of laser scoring, but they warrant thin wall molding condi- tions. This paper describes material characterization under thinwall molding conditions wherein the effects of processing on mechanical properties are explored. This paper also discusses results from a pro- prietary finite element code developed at GE to predict the process- ing parameters, which affect the mechanical properties of the mate- rial at the tearseam in a seamless IP system. The purpose of the study is to create an accurate analytical material model for use in finite element analysis of thin- wall applications. 2001-01-1275. (SP-1602) A coordination approach for DYC and active front steering. M. Selby, W. J. Manning, M. D. Brown, and D. A. Crolla, University of Leeds. Integrating chassis control systems can lead to improvements in the safety, efficiency of action and overall production of a modern car. The sharing of information between chassis sub-systems allows the controller to take the optimum course of action since it has more than one option to affect the dynamics of a vehicle. This paper investigates the principle of coordination of chassis subsystems by selecting active steering and yaw stability control. A controller that coordinates the action of active front steering(AFS) and direct yaw moment control(DYC) is proposed. Preliminary results for the coordinated controller using limit han- dling tests suggest that such an integrated approach can lead to over- all improvements in vehicle dynamic response. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1276. (SP-1602) Research of driver assistance system for recovering vehicle stability from unstable states. Xinpeng Tang, Huazhong Univ. of Science and Technology; and Kenichi Yoshimoto, Univ. of Tokyo. Recently, the direct yaw-moment control system, in which brak- ing or driving torque is distributed appropriately to the tires on either side, has been put to practical use. Such systems are called VDC or VSC, and are available on the market. These systems aim to prevent the vehicle from falling into an unstable state, but cannot bring a destabilized vehicle back to a stable state. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that highly skilled drivers are capable of steering a destabilized vehicle back into control. In this paper, we propose a driver-assistance system that automatically steers the front wheels in order to recover a vehicle that is spinning out. When a vehicle enters a tailspin, the system takes over the steering. Once the vehicle recovers, control is given back to the driver. The issue of how to return control from automatic to manual is of particular interest. 2001-01-1277. (SP-1602) A study on vehicle driving environ- ment recognition.

For the past two decades, realistic, high-performance driving simulation technology for human factors and vehicle prototyping applications has been the exclusive domain of multi-million dollar systems. Recent advances in open systems and modular computer architecture has allowed high-performance simulation platforms to evolve, incorporating sufficient accuracy for manufacturer's appli- cations. The continuing reduction in the cost of high-performance computing and image-generating hardware combined with the simu- lator' s reduced operations and maintenance budgets feed the low cost side of this equation. Designing a simulator to be able to be operated by a broad spectrum of researchers and engineers requires a sophisticated and flexible operator's station with intuitive, icon- based graphical user interface (GUI) and scenario construction sta- tion. This paper describes the Century Series Mark II driving simu- lator (configured as an off-road Hummer) designed and built by I-SIM Corporation of Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Its subsystems, design philosophy, performance issues, including the human factors concerns that must be considered for fully immersive applications and driver acceptance (attitude adjustment) are addressed. 2001-01-1280. (SP-1602) A generic suspension model for mid- dle class passenger vehicles. Derek K. Ward, Oliver Hanke, Tors- ten Bertram, and Manfred Hiller, Gerhard-Mercator-Univer sitāt Duisburg ; and Roberto Bardini, University of Duisberg. Detailed vehicle models are often used for the simulation of vehi- cle dynamics. Good results are obtained, but the development time required for new models is very high, and depends on the complex- ity of the simulation to be carried out. This high level of effort is needed every time a new vehicle is modeled. A generic model for a middle class European passenger vehicle, with a minimum set of parameters to correlate the model to different vehicles, is discussed in this contribution. The model should be sufficient for detecting the start of rollover in rollover simulations to the required accuracy, for example. This provided reasonable results in most cases, with a small number of vehicle specific parameters, but specific vehicle suspension arrangements caused problems. A solution for this prob- lem - the development of a generic suspension model - is then discussed. 2001-01-1281. (SP- 1572) Relationships between pre-skidding and pre-braking speed. Robert Overgaard, Ravinder Johal, Michael Araszewski, and Amrit Toor, INTECH Engineering Ltd. This paper investigates the accuracy of vehicle pre-braking speed estimates based upon tire/roadway coefficient of friction (drag fac- tor) measurements and skid mark measurements. Data was collected to determine if there were any correlations between pre-braking speeds and pre-skidding speeds. Braking tests were performed on three vehicles using various measurement devices including an 172</page><page sequence="172">2001-01-1281-2001-01-1287 accelerometer, a fifth wheel, a radar gun, and a shot marker (bumper gun) system. The vehicle speeds, braking distances, skid mark dis- tances, and deceleration histories were recorded. From this data, coefficients of friction for the tested road surface were evaluated. The coefficients of friction were then used in combination with the measured skid mark distances to calculate the vehicle pre-skidding speeds. The calculated pre-skidding speeds were then compared to the actual pre-braking speeds of the vehicles in order to establish the accuracy of the calculation methodology. A correlation between the calculated pre-skidding speed and the actual pre-braking speed was established for the study data. 2001-01-1282. (SP-1572) Light bulb filament analysis - Understanding the effect of inertial impact forces. Shawn Price Ray , Michelle Fabris Jewell , and Bryan Treat, Precision F or ensics, LLC. Most accident ^constructionists realize that valuable informa- tion about a collision can be obtained from evaluating light bulb fila- ments. However, few fully understand the scientific phenomenon involved, and little research has been conducted in recent years. This study presents an applicable representation of realistic automobile collisions. In addition, the study takes into account the effect of used/aged bulbs and determines how effective filament stretch anal- ysis can be used and under what conditions such analysis should be avoided. An innovative duration sensitive light bulb acceleration apparatus was used to determine if a consistent threshold Delta V exists that can be used to assist in the determination of impact severity. 2001-01-1283. (SP-1572) Reconstruction of accident severity in a multiple vehicle collision. Dagmar Buzeman Jewkes, Woolley Engineering Research Corp. This paper presents various reconstruction methods for a multi- ple-car collision, resulting from one vehicle approaching a line of stationary, undamaged vehicles that consequently pushes the sta- tionary vehicles into one another. Under these conditions, the approaching vehicle speed and delta-V of all vehicles can be esti- mated from the summation of all vehicles' front and rear damage plus their run-out energies. However, seldom are all vehicles avail- able for damage inspection, or are the skid/gouge-marks or friction- coefficients adequately known. The accident severity of the colli- sion pair of interest would be reconstructed more efficiently if the damage energy method were applied to only this collision pair. This method, however, entails the concern that the observed damage of these two vehicles has been enhanced by the subsequent collisions. An analysis is presented to specify the conditions under which initial vehicle damage of a collision pair is not enhanced by succes- sive collisions, such that the initial delta-V of the vehicles of interest can be calculated using only the front and rear damage energy of that pair. The vehicles must have low restitution and sufficient space between them, such that the vehicle pile-up can be treated like a sequence of two-vehicle crashes (where the approaching vehicle may consist of a combination of the previously collided vehicles). The method is applicable for most real-world accidents, unless one or more of the vehicles is significantly heavier and/or stiffer than the vehicles of interest. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1284. (SP-1572) Physical evidence analysis and roll velocity effects in rollover accident reconstruction. Jon E. Bready and Andrew A. May, Collision Safety Engineering, L.C.; and Doug- las "L" Allsop, Accident Reconstruction &amp; Engineering Analysis, Inc. Rollover accidents often have a vast amount of information available for determining vehicle and occupant kinetics and kine- matics. Physical evidence and photographs of the accident scene and vehicle can be used to determine trajectories, distances, velocities and orientations. The direction, angle, and chronological order of scrapes or scratch patterns and other directional indicators on the vehicle peripheral surfaces are typically used to reconstruct the vehi- cle orientation throughout the rollover sequence. Evidence from the scene and vehicle, however, can sometimes appear inconsistent, because they suggest a substantially different vehicle orientation at a particular contact point. An apparent incon- sistency of this nature can often be corrected by accounting for the effects of vehicle roll velocity during surface contacts. This paper examines the effects of vehicle roll velocity on scrape angle, presents a method to more accurately determine vehicle ori- entations in rollover accident reconstruction, and briefly discusses the relationship between vehicle revolutions and translational distance. 2001-01-1286. (SP-1582) Fuel additive performance evalua- tion for volume production application of a diesel particulate fil- ter. M. W. Vincent and P. Richards, Associated Octel Company Limited; F. Novel-Cattin and B. Mar celly, Renault; and C. Favre, Segime. Diesel particulate filter (DPF) technology is becoming increas- ingly established as a practical method for control of particulate emissions from diesel engines. In the year 2000, production vehicles with DPF systems, using metallic fuel additive to assist regenera- tion, became available in Europe. These early examples of first gen- eration DPF technology are forerunners of more advanced systems likely to be needed by many light-duty vehicles to meet Euro IV emissions legislation scheduled for 2005. Aspects requiring attention in second generation DPF systems are a compromise between regeneration kinetics and ash accumula- tion. The DPF regeneration event is activated by fuel injection, either late in the combustion cycle (late injection), or after normal combustion (post injection), leading to increased fuel consumption. Therefore for optimum fuel economy, the duration of regeneration and/or the soot ignition temperature must be minimized. Both effects are strongly favored by a higher treat rate of the metallic fuel additive. On the other hand, the more metal is added to the fuel, the more ash is produced and stored within the filter, implying reduc- tions in engine performance over time. The objective of a 250,000 km lifetime for diesel car (with entire equipment, including DPF) leads to a desire to reduce metal treat rate while minimizing regener- ation duration, and soot ignition temperature. Earlier work on a cerium fuel additive laid the foundations for the determination of influential parameters for regeneration rate. A bed engine test protocol was set up to optimize the treat rate of iron/ strontium and iron-based additives, in terms of kinetics and ash pro- duction. The final outcome of the test program has resulted in over- all improved performance for this second-generation DPF system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1287.

Seguelong, Rhodia Terres Rares; and P. Rouveirolles, Renault Automobiles. A test protocol, allowing for the evaluation of diesel particulate filters of different materials and of different sizes, located at various distances from the engine was developed. A total of 13 filter config- urations were tested on a Euro I naturally aspirated diesel light-duty truck with a fully passive trap system, utilizing only cerium-based additive in the fuel. It was proved that regeneration under constant urban driving conditions was always possible, at an exhaust gas temperature at the trap inlet in the range of 250 -350°C. On a gravi- metric basis, the efficiency of the traps tested concerning PM was in the order of 45 - 80% over the NEDC, depending on trap material and location along the exhaust pipe and reflecting the specific com- position of the PM generated by the vehicle. No major effect on gas- eous emissions (HC, NOx and CO) was observed. The fuel penalty depends on the regeneration frequency; with average trap load it was found in the order of 15%, with maximum values (just before regen- eration) exceeding 30%. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 173</page><page sequence="173">2001-01-1281-2001-01-1298 2001-01-1293. Quantitative measurements of direct-injection gasoline fuel sprays in near-nozzle region using synchrotron x-ray. Yong Yue, Christopher F. Powell , Ramesh Poola , and Jin Wang , Ar gonne National Laboratory; Ming -Chia Lai, Wayne State Univ.; and Scott E. Parrish, Outboard Marine Corp. A quantitative and time-resolved technique has been developed to probe the dense spray structure of direct-injection (DI) gasoline sprays in near-nozzle region. This technique uses the line-of-sight absorption of monochromatic x-rays from a synchrotron source to measure the fuel mass with time resolution better than 1 ps. The small scattering cross-section of fuel at x-rays regime allows direct measurements of spray structure that are difficult with most visible- light optical techniques. Appropriate models were developed to determine the fuel density as a function of time. 2001-01-1294. Quantitative measurement of droplets and vapor concentration distributions in diesel sprays by processing UV and visible imag. Yuyin Zhang and Keiya Nishida, University of Hiroshima; and Takuo Yoshizaki, Nippon Institute of Technology. In order to measure the droplets and vapor concentration inside a fuel spray, a dual-wavelength laser absorption- scattering tech- nique was developed using the second harmonic (532nm) and the fourth harmonic (266nm) of a Nd:YAG laser and using dimethyl- naphthalene as the test fuel. The investigation results show that dimethylnaphthalene, which has physical properties similar to diesel fuel, is almost transparent to visible light near 532nm and is a strong absorber of ultraviolet light near 266nm. Based on this result, the vapor concentration in a fuel spray can be determined by the two separate measurements: a transmission measurement at a non- absorbing wavelength to detect the droplets optical thickness and a transmission measurement at an absorbing wavelength to detect the joint vapor and droplets optical thickness. The droplets density can be determined by extinction imaging through the transmission at the non-absorbing wavelength. Based on this technique, the distribu- tions of droplets and vapor concentration in diesel sprays, which were injected into an atmosphere of high-temperature (833K) and high-pressure (4.1MPa) nitrogen, were imaged and quantitatively analyzed. The experimental results show that this imaging technique is a promising diagnostics to simultaneously obtain quantitative information on droplets and vapor concentration in a fuel spray. 2001-01-1295. Diffusion-flame/wall interactions in a heavy- duty DI diesel engine. John E. Dec, Sandia National Laboratories; and Dale R. Tree, Brigham Young Univ. Over the past decade, laser diagnostics have improved our under- standing of many aspects of diesel combustion. However, interac- tions between the combusting fuel jet and the piston-bowl wall are not well understood. In heavy-duty diesel engines, with typical fuels, these interactions occur with the combusting vapor-phase region of the jet, which consists of a central region containing soot and other products of rich-premixed combustion, surrounded by a diffusion flame. Since previous work has shown that the OH radical is a good marker of the diffusion flame, planar laser-induced fluo- rescence (PLIF) imaging of OH was applied to an investigation of the diffusion flame during wall interaction. In addition, simulta- neous OH PLIF and planar laser-induced incandescence (PLII) soot imaging was applied to investigate the likelihood for soot deposition on the bowl wall. Using these diagnostics and a specially designed piston bowl-rim window, high-resolution images were acquired of the leading edge of the jet as it impinged on the combustion-bowl wall in an optically accessible diesel engine of the heavy-duty size- class. The images show that as the jet encounters the wall, the lead- ing edge frequently deforms, flattening the diffusion flame along the wall surface. Despite being close to the wall, the flame appears to remain active for a short time before being extinguished along the portion of the jet that is against the wall. The simultaneous OH-PLIF and PLII-soot images show that this allows the soot within the com- busting jet to impinge directly on the wall, making it available for wall deposition. Measurements of the soot/wall deposition and its potential as a contributing pathway to engine-out particulate emis- sions are discussed in a companion paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1296. Extinction measurements of in-cylinder soot deposition in a heavy-duty DI diesel engine. Dale R. Tree, Brig- ham Young Univ.; and John E. Dec, Sandia National Laboratories. The combustion process in diesel engines deposits soot on the in-cylinder surfaces. Previous works have suggested that these soot deposits eventually break off during cylinder blow-down and the exhaust stroke and contribute significantly to exhaust soot emis- sions. In order to better understand this potential pathway to soot emissions, the authors recently investigated combusting fuel-jet/ wall interactions in a diesel engine. This work, published as a com- panion paper, showed how soot escaped from the combusting fuel jet and was brought in close proximity to the wall so that it could become a deposit. The current study extends this earlier work with laser-extinction measurements of the soot-deposition rate in the same single-cylinder, heavy-duty DI diesel engine. Measurements were made by passing the beam of a CW-diode laser through a window in the piston bowl rim that was in-line with one of the fuel jets. The change in transmittance of this beam with the number of fired cycles provides a measurement of the net soot deposition rate. Data were obtained for three fuel blends of varying oxygen concentration and for number 2 diesel fuel at eight different operating conditions. Initially, the net deposition rate was nearly constant; however, after the soot-layer thickness increased, the net deposition rate decreased, indicating that the soot was being removed or the deposition rate was slowing. By combining the mea- sured initial deposition rates with the deposition area (as determined from digital images of the combustion chamber), estimates were obtained of the total initial soot deposition rate for the whole com- bustion chamber. These estimates were compared with steady-state exhaust soot measurements over the eight operating conditions. The results showed that as operating conditions were varied, changes in the initial deposition rate did not correlate with changes in the amount of exhaust soot, and in some cases the initial deposition rate exceeded the exhaust-soot rate. This poor correlation suggests that soot wall-deposition and blow-off is not a major contributor to the changes in engine-out soot emissions over the range of operating conditions examined. It also suggests that the net deposition rate is being reduced from its high initial value to a steady- state value by some mechanism other than by being blown-off into the exhaust gases. Possible alternative mechanisms are suggested and discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1297. (SP-1573) Modeling and numerical analysis of NOx storage-reduction catalysts - On the two effects of rich- spike duration. Shinji Kojima, Naoki Baba, and Shin-ichi Mat- sunaga, Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc.; and Kouji Senda, Kenji Katoh, and Takaaki Itoh, Toyota Motor Corp. Two effects of rich-spike duration on NOx-storing have been analyzed. The first one, that NOx-storing speed decreases as rich- spike duration increases, is explained as the influence of NOx diffu- sion in wash-coat layer, which is quantified by a simple mathemati- cal expression for NOx-storing rate. The second one, a peculiar behavior of NOx-storing in appearance of the outlet NOx concentra- tion, is clarified: Heat produced directly or indirectly (via oxygen storage in ceria) by rich- spike warms up the downstream part, which releases excess NOx at the raised temperature. Contributions of the oxygen storage and the carbonate of NOx-storage material are also discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1298.

NOx adsorber has already been used for the after-treatment sys- tem of series production vehicle installed with a lean-burn or direct- injection engine. In order to improve NOx adsorbability at high tem- peratures, many researchers have recently been trying an addition of potassium (K) as well as other conventional NOx adsorbents. Potassium, however, reacts easily with the cordierite honeycomb substrate at high temperatures, and not only causes a loss in NOx adsorbability but also damages the substrate. Three new technologies have been proposed in consideration of the above circumstances. First, a new concept of K-capture is applied in washcoat design, mixed with zeolite, to improve thermal stability of K and to keep high NOx conversion efficiency, under high temperatures, of NOx adsorber catalyst. Second, another new technology, pre-coating silica over the boundary of a substrate and washcoat, is proposed to prevent the reaction between potassium and cordierite. The NOx adsorber catalyst, adopting these technolo- gies, has demonstrated less crack formation and high NOx adsorba- bility at high temperatures even after severe accelerated aging test on the engine bench. The last one of the three technologies is the mixing of K retention compound and titanium compound in the washcoat with the aim of suppressing sulfur poisoning. The com- pound mixing in the washcoat has proven its effectiveness since K adsorbent has the advantage of easier sulfur desorption as compared with barium (Ba). A newly developed NOx adsorber system is considered to be one of the potential technologies to deal with increasingly stringent NOx regulations for even high exhaust temperature applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1299. (SP- 1573) Suppression of sulfide emission dur- ing lean NOx trap desulfation. J. R. Asik, D. A. Dobson, and G. M. Meyer, Ford Motor Co. Lean NOx traps are being extensively examined because they can be efficiently used to reduce the NOx emissions from port-fuel- injected and direct-fuel-injected spark-ignited gasoline engines. A lean NOx trap (LNT) stores NOx during lean A/F engine operation. However, its storage capacity is limited and the LNT must be regen- erated periodically by subjecting the LNT to momentary rich A/F operation for several seconds. The regeneration process releases the NOx that is chemically bonded to the washcoat and subsequently reduces it to N2 and O2. Fuel that contains a non-zero amount of sul- fur will contaminate an LNT by significantly reducing its NOx stor- age capacity. Therefore, except for the case of a zero level of sulfur in the fuel, the LNT must be desulfated on a periodic basis. The desulfation process requires that the temperature of the LNT be raised to a temperature of about 650° C for several minutes. Earlier work has shown that the stored sulfur is emitted as SO2 and H2S dur- ing desulfation. The emission of H2S is undesirable because of its highly odiferous nature. Two methods of hydrogen sulfide suppres- sion were investigated. The first method involved adding a gettering material, such as nickel, to the lean NOx trap washcoat. The second method involved providing a low frequency AFR modulation whose purpose is to "pump" air (oxygen) into the LNT periodically during desulfation. Both methods have been found to attenuate markedly the H2S peak concentration and to shift the mass emitted ratio of the two sulfur-containing constituents from predominantly H2S to SO2. Test results and control system design are presented for both steady state and transient operation for a 1.8L 14 engine in a 1477 kg (3250 lb) test vehicle. The transient tests were carried out on the U.S. FTP75 drive cycle and on the European NEDC drive cycle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1300. (SP-1573) Study of TWC in NOx adsorber cat- alyst system for gasoline direct injection engine. H. Nakajima, Y. Yamaguchi, and K. Tashiro, Mitsubishi Motors Co., Ltd.; and S. Taniguchi, and H. Goto, I CT Co., Ltd. Extensive research and development has been per-formed to develop the NOx-adsorber catalytic system, which would make Mit- subishi vehicles powered by the gasoline direct-injection (GDI™) engines comply with European Stage 4 emissions regulations. This NOx-adsorber catalytic system is a three-brick configuration, con- sisting of a three-way catalyst in the front (the front catalyst) and the rear catalytic converter, composed of a new NOx-adsorber cata- lyst and a conventional three-way catalyst (TWC). In the present research work, a special effort has been made to define the required performance of the front catalyst, particularly with HC reduction efficiency at the cold start, the steady-state leaner A/F and the tran- sient phase of the A/F from leaner to stoichiometric. For HC reduc- tion, it has been found that platinum (Pt) had the highest HC effi- ciency. In a Pt/rhodium (Rh) catalyst, if Rh and Pt are both included in the washcoat, the Rh content adversely effects Pťs HC reduction capability. From the aspect of HC control, palladium (Pd) is gener- ally recommended over Pt. Recent trends in precious metals pricing in the market show a sharp increase in pricing due to an expanded demand for these metals for automotive emissions control. Accord- ingly, the use of precious metals, particularly a high load of Pd in the catalyst, can no longer be possible, and Mitsubishi has thus developed a front catalyst that has higher performance with less Pt and Rh loading. The test results suggest that the new NOx-adsorber catalytic system will have a high potential of meeting the EU Stage 4 emissions regulations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1301. (SP-1573) An intelligent catalyst. Hirohisa Tanaka, Mari Uenishi, and Isao Tan, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd.; Mareo Kimura, Toyota Central R&amp;D Labs., Inc.; and Junichiro Mizuki, and Yasuo Nishihata, Japan Atomic Energy Research Insti- tute. The catalyst of the crystalline ceramics known as a perovskite- type oxide was designed and controlled at the atomic level in order to create a new function for self-regeneration of precious metals in a usage ambience without auxiliary treatment. We have already reported that a catalyst with Pd supported on the perovskite-type oxide has higher activity than a catalyst with Pd supported on alumina. It was also found that Pd supported on the perovskite catalyst is finely dispersed. The object of this study was to investigate the mechanism of self- regeneration by using hyperanalytical facilities. XAFS analysis, at SPring- 8 (8 GeV), revealed that Pd is in six-fold coordinations with oxygen in a perovskite crystal, which indicating that Pd occupies the B site of the unit formula of ABO3 in the perovskite crystal structure under oxidation atmosphere. XPS analysis showed that metallic PD at the surface of the per- ovskite crystal, which was segregated from the crystals in reduction atmosphere, formed a solid solution again in the perovskite crystals in oxidation atmosphere. This cycle, in which Pd segregated out from and shifted back into the perovskite crystal structure in accor- dance with the atmosphere, realized a precious metal regenerates itself and remains highly active without requiring any auxiliary treatment. We named such a catalyst "An Intelligent Catalyst." 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1302. (SP-1573) PremAir® catalyst system- OBD concepts. Ronald M. Heck, Fred M.

A new technology called PremAir® Catalyst Systems takes a different approach and directly reduces ambient, ground level ozone. For mobile applications, the new system involves coating a heat exchange device in a vehicle, such as the radiator or air conditioning condenser. The catalyst converts ozone to oxygen as ozone- containing ambient air passes over the coated surface of the radiator.

In December 1998 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) agreed to provide emissions credits for adopting the PremAir catalyst sys- tem under the LEV program. This provides automobile manufactur- ers an alternative "tool" for reducing fleet-wide non-methane organic gas (NMOG) vehicle emissions and complying with the LEV requirements.

(SP- 1573) A non-noble metal-based catalytic converter for two-stroke, two-wheeler applications. Rajesh B. Biniwale, N. K. Labhsetwar, R. Kumar, and M. Z. Hasan, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. Two wheelers constitute almost three-fourths of the vehicular population in developing countries like India, and consequently they are the major contributors to vehicular pollution. Catalytic convert- ers based on non-noble metal catalyst have been developed for 2-stroke, 2-wheelers application. In this study, a modified and ther- mally stable alumina washcoat has been developed for application of non-noble metal catalyst. Alumina washcoat has been used on both ceramic and metallic honeycomb substrates and subsequently the perovskite type of catalyst has been synthesized in-situ on alu- mina washcoated substrates. Extensive characterization was carried out during development of alumina washcoat and synthesis of per- ovskite catalyst to establish the thermal stability of alumina wash- coat and phase formation of catalysts. A number of prototypes based on alumina-supported perovskite have been prepared and tested for mass conversion efficiency with respect to CO, HC, and NOx. The results reveal the confirmation of performance of converter for EURO-I emission norms, which are presently applicable in India for 2-stroke, 2 wheelers. The optimized design of converter minimizes the pressure drop across the converter and the power loss of the engine is well within tolerable limits. 2001-01-1304. A proactive design development process - An automotive example of door glass guidance mechanism. Lalit K. Herbert, General Motors Corp. Today's competitive market requires new products to have extremely high Quality; customer expectation demands it. Testing, Validation, Setting Requirements, Failure Mode &amp; Effect Analysis (FMEA), and Design Reviews by themselves do not improve a product; they only provide information that has to be translated into Design/Manufacturing &amp; Service tasks. The quality of these tasks determines how well the new product will perform at its introduc- tion. This paper outlines a generic Development Process through the use of an automotive example for a Door Glass Guidance Mecha- nism. This process includes the fundamental steps involving recom- mendations for setting requirements, benchmarking, and a method- ology on how to design in requirements through the use of analytical and experimental tools to create Robust Designs. Also included are examples of Validation and Assessment Plans that are requirement driven. The details of this example are based on the development of a Glass Guidance Mechanism for a future GM Program. Due to proprietary information, only sufficient details are included to show implementation of this process. 2001-01-1305. Child injuries and fatalities - Who is behind the wheel? Jack Edwards, Ford Motor Co. ; and Charles P. Comp- ton, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Recent crash data was used to evaluate the safety performance of drivers who transport children. The age difference between driv- ers and children was found to be an important predictor of crash- related driving behavior and choices. Also, certain driver behaviors and choices when transporting children were identified as creating elevated risk. This study provides information that parents might use to reduce risk when their children are riding with other drivers. The results may also be of interest to professionals concerned with grad- uated licensing and the establishment and enforcement of laws relat- ing to child endangerment such as drinking and driving with child passengers. 2001-01-1306. Tumble Generator Valve (TGV) control of in- cylinder bulk flow and its turbulence near spark plug in SI engine. Makoto Kaneko, SUBARU Research Center Co. Ltd.; and Yuji Ikeda and Tsuyoshi Nakajima, KOBE Univ. The in-cylinder bulk flow and turbulence characteristics in a spark ignition engine were examined using two particle image velo- cimetry (PIV) systems. The effects of a turbulence-generating valve (TGV) bulk flow and turbulence characteristics were investigated. The results show that both the motion and location of turbulent flow can be controlled by a TGV valve. This could be used to reduce the level of unburned hydrocarbons produced during a cold start. The time history and scales of turbulence were compared with those obtained using laser doppler velocimetry. The developed PIV sys- tems were accurate, and the measured data were reliable enough to permit discussion of the cycle-resolve and cycle-to-cycle variation of in-cylinder flow. At top dead center, the measured turbulence scales of motion in the flow with the TGV closed were two-thirds of those obtained with the TGV open. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1307. Analysis of the intake flow in a diesel engine head using dynamic steady flow conditions. M. Auriemma, F. E. Cordone, U. DI Martino, and G. Valentino, Istituto Motori, CNR. An experimental investigation, using the Laser Doppler Ane- mometry (LDA) technique, was carried out to investigate the com- plex structure of the intake flow in a commercial four-cylinder auto- motive desel engine. The attention was focused on the evaluation of the mean motion and turbulence intensity by using a steady state test rig with dynamic valve flow arrangements, supplying a flow rate of 17.4m3/h, that corresponds to the actual flow rate of the engine running at 2,000 rpm. The LDA tests were performed with the engine head mounted on a plexiglas cylinder, having the same diameter as that of the real engine, equipped with optical accesses. The intake manifold was connected to a flow bench tester to simu- late the actual flow rates of the engine. Measurement points were located within the cylinder at different distances from the cylinder axis, on two orthogonal diameters, and at different depths from the engine head. The instantaneous velocities were processed by using an ensemble averaging technique in order to estimate the mean velocity and the turbulence intensity. The main results showed that both the mean tangential and axial velocities increase during the valve opening period, reaching the maximum magnitude when the valve is closed for every measure- ment points. The velocities decrease subsequently to near zero val- ues at 60° cam angle (c.a.) after the valve closure. Results high- lighted a complicated flow field structure with a tumble motion in the vertical plane, which forms and grows during the valve lift and spreads until 60° c.a. after the valve closure. The turbulence inten- sity profile displayed a high level around the valve closure with a decaying trend until 60° c.a. after the valve closure. 2001-01-1308. Some critical technical issues on the steady flow testing of cylinder heads. Hongming Xu, Jaguar Cars. There are considerable diversities in the techniques used for the steady flow testing of engine cylinder heads, and this paper presents and discusses the important issues involved in the flow bench exper- iment. The work aims to provide information necessary for setting 176</page><page sequence="176">2001-01-1308-2001-01-1314 up or upgrading the experimental system of cylinder head testing. The definitions of discharge/flow coefficients and swirl/tumble ratios are compared and examined, followed by the principles of selecting the test conditions such as pressure drop and flow rate. Techniques for measuring the angular flow momentum in cylinders are discussed and the link between the steady flow parameters and the engine combustion performance is highlighted. Some conclu- sions and recommendations are drawn from the discussion. 2001-01-1309. LDA investigation on valve - Wall and valve - Valve flow interaction in high-performance 4- valve I.C.E. Sergio Bova and Mario Amelio, University of Calabria. The fluid dynamic efficiency of two different four-valve high- performance engine heads has been compared both in terms of global mass flow rate and in terms of local velocity distribution around the valve curtain, by means of LDA measurements. The two engine heads have the same bore and valve diameters, but a slightly different valve position and valve stem inclination. Results clearly show that valve-wall distance is a critical factor for head permeabil- ity and that even marginal variations in valve position and inclina- tion lead to appreciable differences in flow pattern and total flow rate. 2001-01-1310. Development of second generation of gasoline P-ZEV technology. K. Nishizawa, S. itsuishi, K. Mori, and S. Yamamoto, Nissan Motor., Ltd. This paper describes the second generation of the partial zero emission vehicle (P-ZEV) technology that was developed for use on the Nissan Sentra CA sedan sold in California. The second- generation engine has been adopted on a mass-produced model mar- keted in Japan. Besides continuing the super ultra low emission vehicle (SULEV) performance of the Sentra CA, the second- generation technology incorporates a compact, two-stage HC trap catalyst system. The system has been substantially reduced in size and cost as a result of improving the catalyst and the substrate and reducing the total catalyst volume by optimizing the control method. Moreover, the second-generation P-ZEV technology includes an electrically actuated continuously variable swirl control valve of the high-speed jet type, a high-response electrically actuated EGR valve and catalyst model control based on the use of an air-fuel ratio sen- sor. Besides contributing to low emission levels, these components are also used to achieve the maximum fuel economy improvement through innovative control of the engine operating conditions. As a result, the improved engine greatly reduces both fuel consumption and CO2 emissions to comply with Japan fuel economy standards to be enforced in 2010. These various improvements have resulted in the development of a production engine that combines outstand- ing emission performance with superior fuel economy to meet the environmental requirements of the 21st century. 2001-01-1311. LEV II applications based on a lean start cali- bration. Filip Acke and Per Marsh, Volvo Car Corp. This paper compares and discusses the impact of conventional and improved start strategies on the design of the exhaust aftertreat- ment system. It is recognized that hardware measures on the exhaust side will not be sufficient if Volvo's 5- and 6-cy linder engines are to fulfill SULEV emission levels, assuming passive three-way systems only. A new start strategy, providing an excessive heat profile combined with low engine out hydrocarbon emissions, was therefore devel- oped. Temperature profiles, raw emissions and mass flow obtained with the Lean Start Calibration will be shown for the 5- and 6-cylin- der engines, both naturally aspirated as turbo. The remaining part of the paper presents a brief history of the exhaust aftertreatment design modifications for Volvo's 5-cylinder N/A engine fulfilling LEV, ULEV I, ULEV II and PZEV emission levels respectively. The impact of the new start strategy on the cold- start performance will be shown. The results will demonstrate the potential of an underfloor only system for ULEV II emission levels and a close coupled cascade plus under floor system for PZEV emis- sion levels when the new start strategy is applied. The effect of design parameters such as substrate choice, catalyst volume, ... as well as the effect of aging (both temperature and poisoning), on the cold start and the hot phase emissions will be discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1312. Can fuel preparation affect engine-out hydro- carbon emissions during an FTP (75CVS) cycle test? James R. Ireton and Edward W. Kaiser, Ford Motor Co. The effect of fuel preparation on time-resolved, engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions over a Federal Test Procedure cycle [FTP (75CVS)] for a ULEV vehicle equipped with a 6-cylinder engine has been investigated. Using a single-cone injector, the HC mole fraction in Bag 1 increased by a factor of 3-4 during each of the three accelerations in the first 100 sec after start. No such increases were observed in Bag 3 when the engine was fully warm. The increases during accelerations in Bag 1 were reduced by a factor of 3 when using a Dual-cone fuel injector as a drop-in substitute. The total, tailpipe FTP (75CVS) mass emissions were 25% smaller when using the Dual-cone injector. These results demonstrate that fuel preparation can affect HC emissions from a vehicle very signifi- cantly during cold start as has been deduced previously during cold- start tests using a dynamometer-controlled engine. In addition, the data suggest that steady- state tests using cold coolant and oil may not correctly represent true cold- start HC emissions. 2001-01-1313. Low emission concept for SULEV. Henning Baumgarten, Knut Habermann, and Rolf Weinowski, FEV Moto- rentechnik GmbH. Today, SULEV legislation represents the most stringent emis- sion standard for vehicles with combustion engines, and it will be introduced starting by Model Year 2003. In order to meet such stan- dards, even higher effort is required for the development of the exhaust gas emission concept of SI engines. Beyond a facelift of the combustion system, exhaust gas aftertreatment, and the engine man- agement system, new approaches are striven for. The principle keys are well known: low HC feed gas, high ther- mal load for quick light-off, exhaust system with low heat capacity and highly effective exhaust gas aftertreatment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1314. Development of a SULEV capable technology for a full-size gasoline PFI V8 passenger car. Manoj K. Karwa, Ricardo, Inc.; John P. Biel and Frederick B. Hill, Jr., Benteler Auto- motive Corp.; and Mark Crocker, dmc2 Degussa Metal Catalysts Cerdee. A full-size V8 demonstrator was developed to exhibit technology required to target LEV II emission levels. The testing involved the system integration of a vacuum-insulated catalytic converter (VICC) technology, air gap exhaust components, optimized catalyst loading and control system and calibration. The development strat- egy utilizes the vacuum insulation, phase-change thermal storage capacity, and cold- start calibration strategy to enable the catalyst to quickly reach light-off in 6 seconds over the FTP-75. All emission testing was conducted with two LA4 preparation cycles. This approach is able to reduce the heat loss of the catalytic converter brick during a 12-hour soak period and optimize the calibration warm-up strategy to reduce the amount of emissions during the first 60 seconds of the FTP-75. The vehicle used for the demonstration was a BMW 5401 appli- cation. The modifications to the vehicle were limited to the control system, engine calibration and aftertreatment. The strategy used can be applied to light- and heavy-duty on-road applications to optimize tailpipe emissions levels. The vehicle also meets nominal drivea- bility requirements over the FTP-75 temperature ranges. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 111</page><page sequence="177">2001-01-1321-2001-01-1329 2001-01-1321. Fatigue testing of sheet metals subject to uni- axial tension-compression. R. P. Kaufman , T. S. Lam , A. Thomp- son, and T. H. Topper, University of Waterloo; and A. Dahayeh, and F. A. Conle, IMP Group Ltd . The paper describes the fabrication and testing of thin sheet metal uniaxial fatigue specimens that have been laminated to pre- vent buckling. When hot or cold rolled metal thicknesses are below 5 mm, the usual fatigue specimens, having a uniform gauge length of 7.5 mm or more, buckle in the short life region (-10000 cycles) of strain-life testing. For thinner materials, non-standard specimen designs or anti-buckling guides have been used, but each of these solutions requires additional instrumentation. The results presented in this paper show that laminating multiple sheets of material together to increase the specimen's effective thickness raises the strain level for the onset of buckling of the standard uniaxial speci- men. Constant and variable amplitude fatigue tests extending into the high-strain short-life region were performed. Fatigue life data for multiple-layer specimens were in good agreement with those obtained for single-layer specimens. 2001-01-1323. New gasket test method and device. David Grant, Manitoba Hydro. Much important electrical equipment is oil filled. The oil serves as both coolant and the primary electrical insulating medium. This oil must be contained, and kept very dry. Soft gaskets are installed around all the access covers and various connections. Not only do the owners of this equipment expect it to be free of leaks for 30 to 60 years, re-gasketing usually takes several days, often at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars, primarily in lost power delivery. Soft gasket materials are known to develop several undesirable charac- teristics in extended service. This test is intended to accelerate, in a controlled, repeatable way, the development of these undesirable characteristics. It involves compressing part of a sample coupon to its service thickness and immersing it in its intended fluid at a tem- perature somewhat higher than in normal service. 2001-01-1324. Supply chain management - The dark side. John H. Groustra and Mark H. Lee, Conway MacKenzie &amp; Dun- leavy. Advances in technology and manufacturing control, altered responsibilities and relationships between OEMs and suppliers, and relentless pressures to compress the vehicle development and pro- duction cycle all have highlighted the importance of supply chain management. With competitive pressures, and novel approaches such as the new OEM-sponsored contract auction system, the importance, and value, of supply chain management will only inten- sify in the days ahead. Looking from the outside in, the new risks of things going wrong have forced OEMs to carry the burden of assessing supplier compe- tencies. The goals include a continual, properly timed supply of components and sub-systems, as well as complex quality and cost standards. As quality programs and marketplace pressures have evolved, these assessments also have gotten harder and harder to accomplish in the names of efficiency, accuracy and fairness. Look- ing from the inside out, suppliers, especially Tier Is, are faced with developing systems to assess their own subordinate supplier net- works and, to a certain extent, be able to speak back to OEMs with intelligence and authority. Is there a way out of the quagmire; to keep the assessment pro- cess from impeding what it is in effect evaluating; to create a level playing field of supply chain management? We believe there is by way of a system called Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). What follows is not intended to be simple, but useful to all parties to supply chain management. We examine the drivers of current trends in supply chain management; and, then, assuming that the benefits of these practices are well known, we assess the risks inherent in them. Finally, we offer some remedies in the form of new risk management principles. 2001-01-1326. (SP- 1585) Generic Integrated PowerTrain Management IPM® interface as a standard. Mariano Sans, Sie- mens Automotive AG. A generic Powertrain Interface is proposed, to provide a global and optimized inter-communication between all the new different electro-mechanical components to be integrated, associated to the traditional thermal engine, as starter-generator, automated transmis- sion, anti-blocking system, navigation, or battery management. This interface is defined as a standard, based on the minimal inputs data needed by each component or functional group, and independent from any hardware communication support. A first example is described, using a standard CAN link between an engine manage- ment and an automated transmission, for new optimal torque and speed synchronization functionality. An extension is proposed, cen- tered on the Siemens Integrated PowerTrain IPM® system described in this paper. 2001-01-1327. (SP-1582) Heavy-duty diesel truck in-use emis- sion test program for model years 1950 through 1975. Steven G. Fritz , Southwest Research Institute; and Chad R. Bailey, Carl A. Scarbro, and Joseph H. Somers, United States Environmental Pro- tection Agency. Criteria pollutants were measured from ten Class 7 and 8 (i.e., gross vehicle weights &gt; 33,000 lb) heavy-duty diesel trucks with engine model years between 1953 and 1975. The data was used by EPA to estimate that period's particulate matter emission rates for these type engines and will be used to develop dose response rela- tionships with existing epidemiological data. Particulate samples were analyzed for sulfate and volatile organic fraction. Carbon soot was estimated. The trucks had particulate emissions of 2 to 10 g/mi as compared to 1 to 6 g/mi for trucks with model year engines from 1975 through the mid-1980s, and less than 1 g/mi for post- 1988 trucks. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1328. XM satellite radio technology fundamentals. Stellios J. Patsiokas, XM Satellite Radio Inc. In October of 1997, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted two national satellite radio licenses. The FCC allo- cated 25 MHz of the electromagnetic spectrum (2.3 GHz frequency band) for satellite digital broadcasting to two companies: 12.5 MHz to XM Satellite Radio and 12.5 MHz to Sirius Satellite Radio. This paper is an overview of the XM Satellite Radio technology. Four major components of the overall Network are described: a) The ground segment; b) The space segment; c) The terrestrial repeater segment and the d) The technology segment. Mobile antenna design challenges are also being addressed and optimum antenna configu- rations are presented. 2001-01-1329. Netting a corporate web community: Industry sponsorship of the Internet.

The Twenty-Five Years' War: The impact and effectiveness of CAFE standards. Michael J. Burg , Jr., Rowan Univ. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were enacted in 1975 as part of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. They were designed and implemented in response to the oil price shocks of that period. Over the last 25 years, the standards have been highly criticized by industry, consumer groups, and legislators. There are many arguments surrounding several key issues regarding this legislation. This paper attempts to analyze each issue and form some conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the CAFE stan- dards over their lifetime. This paper also attempts to allow the reader to form an intelligent and informed opinion on this issue. 2001-01-1331. Side impact airbag testing and regulation: Deflating a potentially explosive topic. Michael D. Carpenter , University of North Carolina at Charlotte. America has been in love with the automobile since the first motorized carriages shared the road with horses. At first this new technology was a pastime for the rich. It was a privilege that was enjoyed by the upper classes of society on weekends and sunny days. As methods of mass production became refined and more eco- nomical, the automobile became so commonplace that one would expect to find one in every backyard. Through a depression, world war and a post-war economic and population boom, the automobile helped shape American life we can all identify with today. To date the automotive industry has gone through many changes, modifica- tions and has reinvented itself several times. Transitions in the auto industry and consumer demand have brought the majority of automobiles from giant, gas-guzzling hunks of steel to lightweight, fuel-efficient modes of transportation (taking into exception the ever-present SUV - which shall be mentioned later). The technological aspect of safety, specifically occupant restraint systems, have followed the trend of beginning in higher- priced models and then trickling down into models of lower prices. Inflatable restraints have and will continue to follow this pattern. This pattern can be seen in the implementation of driver and front passenger airbags in the past and we should expect it to continue in this manner concerning side airbags and curtain systems until the day when virtually all automobiles will have standard frontal and side airbags for all passengers. 2001-01-1332. Improving K-12 science and math education through enhanced teacher quality. Jennifer Elliott , Cedarville Univ. The increasing infiltration of technology into our society has resulted in a growing need for a technology-literate public who understands and supports areas of advancement. In addition, there is a current lack of technically skilled workers to fill the present job market in the United States due to the lack of students who are ade- quately prepared or interested in fields such as science, mathemat- ics, engineering and technology (SMET). The K-12 students who are currently in our school districts are the policy makers, technical workers, and educators of tomorrow. In order to increase the number of Americans who are both technically literate and capable of per- forming the needed technical jobs, emphasis must be placed on improving the educational system in grades K-12 where the process of learning science and mathematics first begins. The focus on improving the educational system must begin with the teachers because they have the greatest impact on the knowledge that stu- dents obtain and on their attitudes toward the subjects. 1) Teachers need to be hired and retained who possess strong backgrounds in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. 2) Teachers need to be given accountability and support through mentoring pro- grams to provide them with the help they need to become estab- lished in the teaching profession. 3) Professional development is needed to keep their skills current and to train them in the most effective methods of presenting the information to their students. 4) In order to retain quality SMET teachers, they need to be treated as professionals, given respect, and rewarded for their accomplish- ments. 5) Finally, the teachers need to incorporate technology into their classrooms and utilize other resources, such as engineering societies, to bring real-world experience to the classroom. Only when the teachers are well prepared, confident in their sub- ject area, continually updating their skills, receiving recognition, and utilizing important resources will the students receive the educa- tion necessary to make them future leaders in science, math, engi- neering, and technology. 2001-01-1333. Modeling of in-vehicle heat transfers using zonal approach. D. Roy, K. El Khoury, and D. Clodic, Centre ď Energétique de V Ecole des MINES de PARIS; and C. Petitjean, Valeo Climate Control. The purpose of the work is the representation of heat transfers in an automotive car cabin by a geometrical and physical simplified model. This one is represented by plane elements receiving a vari- able solar flux in direction and intensity. The significant heat trans- fers (conduction, convection, mass transfer and radiation) are taken into account. The aeraulic phenomena are represented by a zonal approach based on the volume split up in small volumes. Calcula- tion estimates in parallel the view and transfer factors, as well as internal and external solar flux density. Results are surface tempera- tures of the car cabin, in-vehicle air temperature at different levels and also heating or cooling capacity to reach an acceptable comfort level. Experiments have been performed for the validation of calcu- lations. In this paper, validation of the natural convection heat trans- fer is only described. Results are in good agreement with the experiment. 2001-01-1334. (SP- 1607) Integrated, feed-forward hybrid electric vehicle simulation in SIMULINE and its use for power management studies. Chan-Chiao Lin, Zoran Filipi, Yongsheng Wang, Loucas Louca, Huei Peng, Dennis Assanis, and Jeffrey Stein, University of Michigan. A hybrid electric vehicle simulation tool (HE-VESIM) has been developed at the Automotive Research Center of the University of Michigan to study the fuel economy potential of hybrid military/ civilian trucks. In this paper, the fundamental architecture of the feed-forward parallel hybrid-electric vehicle system is described, together with dynamic equations and basic features of sub-system modules. Two vehicle-level power management control algorithms are assessed, a rule-based algorithm, which mainly explores engine efficiency in an intuitive manner, and a dynamic-programming optimization algorithm. Simulation results over the urban driving cycle demonstrate the potential of the selected hybrid system to sig- nificantly improve vehicle fuel economy, the improvement being greater when the dynamic-programming power management algo- rithm is applied. 2001-01-1335. (SP- 1607) Characterization and comparison of two hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) - Honda Insight and Toyota Prius. Michael Duoba, Henry Ng, and Robert Larsen, Ar gonne National Laboratory. Two limited-production hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) -a 1988 Japanese model Toyota Prius and a 2000 Honda Insight -were tested at Argonne National Laboratory to collect data from vehicle compo- nent and systems operation. The test data are used to analyze opera- tion and efficiency and to help validate computer simulation models. Both HEVs have FTP fuel economy greater than 45 miles per gallon and also have attributes very similar to those of conventional gasoline vehicles, even though each HEV has a unique powertrain configuration and operation control strategy. The designs and char- acteristics of these vehicles are of interest because they represent production technology with all the compromises for production included. This paper will explore both designs, their control strate- gies, and under what conditions high fuel economy was achieved. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 179</page><page sequence="179">2001-01-1337-2001-01-1342 2001-01-1337. A research on lean combustion control of pre- chamber-type stratified-charge SI automobile engine with low NOx/fuel c. Haruo Ukawa, Tokyo Denki Univ. This paper analyzes quantitatively mechanisms and its effects of reducing simultaneously NOx/fuel consumption taking the focus on torch-jet lean combustion control modeling in a prechamber-type stratified-charge approach with actual Honda CVCC engine test examples. For analyzing the NOx/fuel consumption reduction mechanism and effects, so-called phenomenological modeling centering around torch-flame-jet behavior are examined with varying the design fac- tors such as auxiliary chamber volume/torch nozzle area. Then, main physical features and those characteristics of torch- flame-jet such as the combustion pressure rise histories in precham- ber, penetration length/volume/speed of torch-jet in lean mixture of main chamber, lean mixture shear-flow entertainment and turbu- lence-enhancing effects induced by torch-jet are computed with numerical methods and those various effects for the lean ignition/ combustion are examined. Finally, verifications are attempted by comparison with real engine-tested results which specific CO/HC/NOx, fuel consumption in [gr/PS-hr] are measured with varying design factors such as pre- chamber volume/torch nozzle area, and trends coincidence are veri- fied sufficiently with computational results. 2001-01-1338. (SP- 1574) Influence of catalysis on combustion in spark ignition engine. Jozef Jarosiński and Jerzy Podfllipski , Technical University of Lodz. Problems of ignition and flame development in combustion chambers of internal combustion engines supplied with lean, homo- geneous, fuel- air mixture are of fundamental importance. One of the effective methods, which can improve flame initiation, is catalytic assistance of ignition and combustion. To be able to use catalysts efficiently in combustion processes in engines, it is necessary to know in detail their catalytic properties. The microcalorimetric method used before to determine characteristic temperatures of cata- lytic reactions was able to determine catalytic performance very roughly, because measurements were carried out at constant pres- sure and temperature of the analyzed mixtures. It was impossible, under such conditions, to evaluate precisely the influence of the cat- alysts on the progress of the combustion processes inside of the combustion chamber. In the present work properties of the catalyst are examined in conditions very similar to those in the engine. Experiments with cat- alytic assistance of ignition and combustion were carried out in a rapid compression machine. The combustion area in the cylinder was divided into two parts: the main combustion chamber and pre- chamber. A catalyst with a developed surface was placed in the pre- chamber. The temperature of the catalyst was controlled by means of a special electronic device. A torch ignition from the prechamber created a swirl in the main chamber. The influence of the catalyst temperature on ignition and combustion of a propane- air mixture was extensively examined in special sets of experiments. Pressure records and history of flame propagation registered by a high-speed video camera showed some advantages of catalytic the assistance of ignition and combustion. 2001-01-1339. Calculated A/F ratio via exhaust gas tempera- ture measurement for small engine control. Joseph R. Griffin and Todd J. Ferguson , Heraeus Sensor-Nite Co.; Hamid Servati , Servo- tech ; and Mark Swanson, Walbro Engine Management. The recent availability of fast response (&lt; 1.0 seconds) exhaust gas temperature sensors for exhaust gas temperature measurement enables a new method for closed loop feedback engine control in small engines and other non- stoichiometric applications (V-8 marine fuel injected engines for example). Conventional closed loop stoichiometric A/F control with traditional switching type oxygen sensors is often not applicable because these engines rarely if ever operate at stoichiometric A/F ratios. Richer A/F ratio control is nec- essary for maximum power and combustion temperature cooling. Wide range UEGO A/F sensors are an alternate solution but the cost of these sensors may be too high. Additionally, the very short exhaust systems found on many small engines can allow ambient air to back flow into the exhaust due to pressure pulsations and cor- rupt the signal from an oxygen concentration type sensor. In marine engines, water in the exhaust can crack the heated sensing element in the UEGO sensor. The positive relationship between A/F ratio and exhaust gas tem- perature is well known. In the range of A/F ratios between 11:1 and 14.5:1, this relationship is almost linear. Most modern automotive engine management systems currently use exhaust gas temperature models based on engine speed, engine load, ignition timing, and A/F ratio (EGR is either constant or closed). Based on these relationships and empirically derived engine mapping, it is possible to calculate A/F ratio from measured exhaust gas temperature along with mea- sured engine speed, engine load, and ignition timing. This paper will describe the development of a calculated A/F ratio signal based on measured exhaust gas temperature on a 500 cc four-stroke engine. Additionally, the results of a comparison between the calculated A/F signal and a measured A/F signal from a UEGO sensor during steady state engine operation with three dif- ferent fuels will be presented. 2001-01-1341. (SP- 15 89) Fuel-flexible, fuel processors (F3P) - Reforming infrastructure fuels for fuel cells. Shawn Barge and Richard Woods , Hydrogen Burner Technology , Inc. Fuel cells will undoubtedly be a part of the next generation of power supply technology. The gap that prevents fuel cells from entering into wide spread service is the lack of a hydrogen infra- structure, but fuel reformers can bridge that gap. A fuel reformer is a device that takes a hydrocarbon fuel (natural gas, gasoline, diesel, etc.) and processes it into a hydrogen rich, proton exchange mem- brane (PEM) fuel cell ready gas stream. Hydrogen Burner Technol- ogy's (HBT) process approach is to use an auto-thermal reformer (ATR), low temperature shift bed (LTS), preferential oxidation reac- tor (PROX), and an anode off gas oxidizer (AGO). These technolo- gies will be explained and discussed in detail. As important as the specific process is how each are tied together and packaged into a commercially viable product. At this stage of fuel cell and fuel reformer development, HBT sees this package as a fully indepen- dent device that can seamlessly be coupled with any PEM fuel cell. Direct attention was paid to manufacturing ease, tight packaging, required periodic maintenance, and most importantly cost. The packages were designed to be fully automated and required only minimal communication from the fuel cell to start up, run at various loads, and shut down. Creating this type of fuel reformer package is a quicker path to real use durability testing with integrated fuel cells, determining unforeseen integration problems sooner, and giv- ing valuable data to the potential manufacturing costs. The progress of this project and the initial results will be discussed. Finally, the goals of the reformer packaging project as well as the planned prog- ress for the next generation of production units will be addressed. 2001-01-1342. (SP- 15 82) Regeneration behavior and tran- sient thermal response of diesel particulate filters. M. D. Rum- minger, X. Zhou , K. Balakrishnan, andB. L. Edgar , Ceryx , Inc.; and O. A. Ezekoye, University of Texas. The diesel particulate filter (DPF) is effective for particulate removal from diesel engine exhaust under a variety of conditions, but development of regeneration strategies remains an ongoing chal- lenge, primarily because of low exhaust temperatures. This paper addresses two issues related to DPF regeneration: the thermal response of DPFs during regeneration events and the soot oxidation (i.e., regeneration) rate at varying temperature, flow rate, oxygen content, and unsteady inlet temperature. The experiments are performed in a laboratory reactor, which provides gas temperature and composition similar to diesel engine exhaust. The catalyzed and uncatalyzed DPFs used in this study are 180</page><page sequence="180">2001-01-1342-2001-01-1354 first loaded with soot on an engine dynamometer at a fixed load and engine speed. During constant temperature regeneration experi- ments, the change in pressure drop is monitored to determine the extent of regeneration. Mass loss measurements are used to calcu- late the soot oxidation rate and apparent activation energy for each condition tested. The catalytic coating increases the mass loss rate at a given inlet temperature for each test condition, and also sharply decreases the minimum regeneration temperature. Oxygen content has a strong impact on the soot oxidation rate for the coated and uncoated DPFs. The effect of time-varying inlet gas temperatures on DPF exit temperature are predicted using a numerical model. Comparisons between the model and experiments are favorable. The model shows that a time-varying inlet temperature has little effect on the DPF temperature for high DPF thermal inertia (i.e., the product of mass and heat capacity), low mass flow rate, and high wave frequency. At the experimental conditions examined in this paper, high fre- quency temperature changes have little effect on the regeneration of DPFs below the ignition temperature, but significant effect above the ignition temperature. A combined analysis of the results pro- vides insight into the regeneration process and could lead to improved strategies involving thermal management of the particu- late control system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1343. (SP-1589) Well-to-wheel energy use and green- house gas emissions for various vehicle technologies. J. J. J. Louis , Shell Global Solutions . The well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use of selected alternative vehicles are compared to those of a con- ventional gasoline vehicle. The vehicle technologies investigated are internal combustion engine, hybrid and fuel cell technology. The fuels are assumed to be produced from either crude oil or natural gas. Wherever possible real data has been used. The study shows that hybrid vehicles emit a similar amount of greenhouse gas as fuel cell vehicles. The diesel hybrid uses the least primary energy. The least greenhouse gas emissions are produced by natural gas and hydrogen hybrid and fuel cell vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1348. (SP-1586) Design and development of a bat- tery-voltage-driven fuel injector for direct-injection gasoline engines. Makoto Yamakado , Yuzo Kadomukai, Motoyuki Abe, and Hiromasa Kubo, Hitachi, Ltd.; and Yasunaga Hamada, Hitachi Car Engineering, Ltd. The conventional fuel injector for direct-injection gasoline engines is driven by voltage step-up circuitry and current control cir- cuitry. The voltage step-up circuitry boosts the battery voltage to near 100 volts. This conventional system is fairly large and a more compact system is preferable. We have developed a mass- producible battery-voltage-driven fuel injector for direct-injection gasoline engines. The injector has a dual-coil structure that enables the injector to operate at the battery voltage, thus eliminating the need for either voltage step-up circuitry or current control circuitry. Deviation in battery voltage and changes in harness resistance are fully compensated through opening-coil energization-time control. In addition, with this control method, the injector can be used with a wide range of fuel pressures. In this paper, the design concept and the dynamic characteristics of the battery-voltage-driven fuel injec- tor with a dual-coil structure and the opening-coil energized-time control method is discussed in detail. 2001-01-1349.

Bernhard Pfalzgraf, Michael Fitzen, Johann Siebler, and Horst-Dieter Erdmann, Audi AG. In an age when there is growing tension between customer expectations of high engine performance, low fuel consumption and compliance with the legal requirements on the emission or airborne pollution, the ability of a vehicle to meet the most stringent emission standards is becoming an increasingly import aspect of its market appeal. The 1.8 L, 5-valve turbo engine which Audi launched in 1994 represented an emissions concept which, thanks to its innovative close-coupled catalytic converter, provided an ideal basis for further development to an engine meeting the US ULEV emission standard, as the current engine does. Its configuration as a ULEV concept necessitated the blanket optimization of all components which influence the exhaust emis- sions. The pistons and injectors were improved in order to reduce untreated emissions. The main potential was tapped by incorporat- ing intake camshaft adjustment and a cascade catalytic converter for emissions aftertreatment, together with extensive measures for the engine management system. The overall concept has enable Audi to become the first car man- ufacturer to offer an exhaust-gas turbocharged gasoline engine that meets the US ULEV emission standard 2001-01-1351. High-efficiency NOx and PM exhaust emission control for heavy-duty on-highway diesel engines. Charles Schenk, Joseph McDonald, and Brian Olson, U.S. EPA. A diesel exhaust emission control system consisting of catalyzed diesel particulate filters and NOx adsorber catalysts arranged in a dual-path configuration was developed and evaluated using a 1999- specification 5.9-liter medium-heavy-duty diesel engine. NOx adsorber regeneration was accomplished via a secondary exhaust fuel injection system. An alternating restriction of the exhaust flow between the two flow paths allowed injection and adsorber regener- ation to occur under very low space velocity conditions. NOx and PM reductions in excess of 90% were observed over a broad range of steady-state operating conditions and over the hot-start HDDE- FTP transient cycle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1353. (SP- 1602) The steering characterizing func- tions (SCFs) and their use in steering system specification, simu- lation, and synthesis. W. Keith Adams and Richard W. Topping, General Motors Corp. A set of functions for characterizing the mechanical properties of a steering "short gear" is described. They cover the kinematic, stiffness, assist, and friction performance of a power-assisted (or manual) steering gear from the input shaft to the inner ends of the tie rods. Their use in describing the performance of a generalized steering gear is described. They have particular application to describing the steering feel performance of a vehicle. They can be used to specify the steering subsystem performance for desired steering feel for a given vehicle. They can also be used for experi- mental characterization of steering subsystems, can be used in vehi- cle dynamics simulations, and can be synthesized from a set of vehi- cle level performance targets. Along with their description, their use in simulation and methods to synthesize their values are described. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1354. Control strategies for a series-parallel hybrid electric vehicle. Dimitrios Rizoulis, Jeffrey Burl, and John Beard, Michigan Technological Univ. Living in the era of rising environmental sensibility and increas- ing gasoline prices, the development of a new environmentally friendly generation of vehicles becomes a necessity. Hybrid electric vehicles are one means of increasing propulsion system efficiency and decreasing pollutant emissions. In this paper, the series-parallel power-split configuration for Michigan Technological University's FutureTruck is analyzed. Mathematical equations that describe the 181</page><page sequence="181">2001-01-1354-2001-01-1405 hybrid power-split transmission are derived. The vehicle's differen- tial equations of motion are developed and the system's need for a controller is shown. The engine's brake power and brake specific fuel consumption, as a function of its speed and throttle position, are experimentally determined. A control strategy is proposed to achieve fuel efficient engine operation. The developed control strat- egy has been implemented in a vehicle simulation and in the test vehicle. Simulation and experimental results are presented and dis- cussed. The control strategy leads to a series hybrid vehicle behavior at low speeds and parallel hybrid vehicle behavior at highway speeds. Furthermore, the strategy ensures charge sustaining vehicle operation. 2001-01-1355. Development of "virtual and real simulator" for engine. Koji Shir ot a, Fumihiko Baba, and Masafumi Horikoshi, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Koji Sato, Ono Sokki Corp. We developed a progressive system, "virtual and real simulator (V&amp;R-S)" for engine. To innovate the process of engine develop- ment, the test system creates dynamic load of drivetrain, wheel, body and road with the virtual vehicle model. We set the phenomena such as drivetrain vibration for reproducing object of this system. The load is transmitted to the engine crankshaft end as torque with the connecting shaft made of fiberglass. The mainly developed tech- nologies are the dynamometer with rotational inertia as low as engine, correction method of transmitted torque error of connecting shaft by H-infinity control. Thanks to these, we achieved the capa- bility of optimization for most of dynamic characteristics (emission, fuel consumption, drivability) on engine test bench. And we now be able to limit real vehicle test to the final tuning. As a result, we have realized new engine evaluation and optimization process. 2001-01-1356. Automotive engine air cleaners - Performance trends. Neville J. Bugli, Visteon Corp. Filtration performance of EAC is generally measured and evalu- ated in the laboratory using standard test procedures. Filtration per- formance and service life expectations of EAC in real-world condi- tions are important for robust designs. Lab measurements may or may not represent real- world conditions. However they do provide stable, repeatable, and quick comparative analysis. Initial efficiency is one of the key performance measures of automotive EAC. Typical bench performance levels for three major air filtration technologies are presented (i.e., initial/overall efficiency, face velocity and dust capacity). The air filter performance effectiveness is also calculated. Typical filtration performance levels are predicted for EAC using paper-type air filter elements. These performances are predicted from empirical models developed for various EAC designs using paper media. Service life expectations are also discussed based on field evalu- ations. Service life of an EAC is related to its dust/contaminant hold- ing capacity and its restriction rise over time. 2001-01-1401. An assessment of a FEA NVH CAE body model for design capability. Mark J. Moeller, Robert S. Thomas, Harish Maruvada, Nurani S. Chandra, and Mark Zebrowski, Ford Motor Co. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models are routinely being adopted as a means of up-front design for automotive body structure design. FEA models play two important functions: first as a means of assessing design versus an absolute target; secondly they are used to assess the performance of design alternatives required to meet tar- gets. Means of assessing model capability versus task is required to feed appropriate information into the design process. Being able to document model capability improves the credibility of the FEA model information. A prior paper addressed assessing the absolute performance of model technology using a metric based on a statistical hypotheses test that determines membership in a reference set. This paper extends the use of quality technology to determining the capability of the FEA model to span the design space using Designed Experi- ments. The advantage of a design of experiments (DOE) structure is that both the design effects and the statistical significance of the design effects are uncovered. 2001-01-1402. Assessment of a vehicle concept finite-element model for predicting structural vibration. Shung H. Sung and Donald J. Nefske, General Motors Corp. A vehicle concept finite-element model is experimentally assessed for predicting structural vibration to 50 Hz. The vehicle concept model represents the body structure with a coarse mesh of plate and beam elements, while the suspension and powertrain are modeled with a coarse mesh of rigid-links, beams, and lumped mass, damping, and stiffness elements. Comparisons are made between the predicted and measured frequency-response-functions (FRFs) and modes of (a) the body-in-white, (b) the trimmed body, and (c) the full vehicle. For the full vehicle, the comparisons are with a comprehensive set of measured FRFs from 63 tests of nomi- nally identical vehicles that demonstrate the vehicle-to- vehicle vari- ability of the measured FRF response. 2001-01-1403. Experimental modal analysis to represent structural components in vehicle models. Romualdo Ruotolo, Politecnico di Torino; and David M. Storer and S. Gatti, Centro Ricerche FIAT. This article describes a technique being developed to determine representative models of difficult-to-analyse structural components such as the fully trimmed car body directly from measured Fre- quency Response Functions. Details are provided of a new system identification method cal- led the Global Smoothing Technique which is proving to be rela- tively reliable and robust even when the modes exhibited by the structural system tend to be highly-damped, closely-coupled and complex. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1404. Various errors in substructure testing. Jianrong Dong, MTS Systems Corp.; Kenneth G. McConnell, Iowa State Univ.; and Mark French, University of Michigan. A frequency domain substructure method is employed for deriv- ing the motion transmissibility equation on a coupled structure. Var- ious errors in its experimental implementation are investigated by numerical calculations in order to identify the most important source of errors so that future effort can be more focused. The interfaces with and without the tangential and rotational DOF's are taken into account when the DOF deficiency error is studied. By decomposing the DOF deficiency error into different components, it is shown that all six interfacial DOF's must be taken into account for general structures. The bias, noise, and underflow errors are investigated and their relative importance is compared with the DOF-deficiency error. It reveals that these three errors are moderate in nature and can be handled with traditional methods while there is no simple way to compensate for the DOF deficiency error. However since there are no mature methods to find rotational FRF from tests, the DOF deficiency error presents a real hurdle to experimentally use the substructure methods. Subsequent efforts should be targeted on how to extract the full set of interfacial frequency response functions that include both translational and rotational DOF's. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1405. Implementing automated multi-level substruc- turing in Nastran vibroacoustic analysis. J. K. Bennighof, M. F. Kaplan, M. Kim, C. W. Kim, and M. B. Muller, University of Texas. Automated Multi-Level Substructuring is a new method for ana- lyzing vibrations of complex structures. Finite element models are automatically divided into thousands of substructures, and response is represented in terms of substructure modes. This method reduces the analysis burden greatly by reducing the computation that must be done, enabling workstations and multiprocessor computing plat- forms to be used, and reducing disk space requirements and job turn- 182</page><page sequence="182">2001-01-1405-2001-01-1412 around time.

An efficient finite element formulation for the analysis of acoustic and elastic waves propagation in sound packages. M. A. Hamdi, L. Mebarek, and A. Omrani, Straco, SA; N. Atalia , Université de Sherbrooke; and M. Fortez , G . Crignon, and S. Lullier , CERA-Trèves. A new mixed finite element formulation very well adapted to analyze the propagation of elastic and acoustic waves in porous absorbing media is presented. The proposed new formulation is based on modified Bioťs equations written in terms of the skeleton displacement and the acoustic pressure in the interstitial fluid. It generalizes the previous formulation proposed in reference, and has the great advantage over existing formulations of automatically sat- isfying interior and exterior boundary conditions without having to compute surface coupling integrals at porous sub-domain interfaces. When elastic forces in the skeleton are neglected, the formulation automatically degenerates to an equivalent fluid model taking into account inertial coupling with the skeleton. In addition it reduces to a minimum the number of degrees of freedom (dofs) and considera- bly simplify the modeling effort by allowing the computation of the generalized impedance matrix added by complex porous compo- nents to the vibro-acoustic impedance matrix of the bare vehicle body. Thus it simplifies the cooperative work between vehicle sup- pliers and manufacturers. This generalized mixed formulation and associated equivalent fluid model has been implemented by STRACO (France) in RAYON-PEM Solver. It is shown in this paper, that the numerical results predicted with RAYON-PEM agrees very well with experimental results using bazooka impedance tube and RTC tests. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1407. Development of a new damping matrices iden- tification method and its applications. Joon-Hyun Lee and J. Kim , University of Cincinnati; and Scott C. Grinker, ArvinMeritor Indus- tries, Ine . An experimental method to identify damping characteristics of a dynamic system is reported. The method identifies damping matri- ces of the equation of motion of the system from measured fre- quency response functions, each different damping mechanism in a distinct matrix. Related experimental techniques and signal process- ing issues are discussed. Theoretical validation and error study are conducted by applying the method to a theoretical example. The method is applied experimentally to a thin beam with two different damping characteristics for experimental validation and demonstra- tion of the method. Important advantages of the method over exist- ing methods are explained. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1408. Estimation of damping loss factors by using the Hilbert transform and exponential average method. C. Q. Liu and Gregory M. Goetchius, DaimlerChrysler Corp. The damping loss factor of a structural panel plays a significant role in its vibro-acoustic performance. The objective of this paper is to present a new procedure for evaluating the damping loss factors of these panels. Traditionally, the damping loss factors are deter- mined by using the decay rate of the decay curves which are experi- mentally obtained from the structure. However, this is time consum- ing and the accuracy is limited by fluctuations in the decay curve. In this paper, the envelope signal of each decay curve is determined through its Hilbert transform, and the remaining small fluctuations in the envelope signal are further smoothed out by the exponential average method. Finally, the damping loss factor is estimated based on the smoothed envelope signal of each decay curve. A computer program has been developed to implement this procedure. It is shown that this procedure improves both accuracy and efficiency of the decay rate method for estimating damping loss factor. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1409. Minimization of error for enforced motion in FEM. Kurt G. Schneider, General Motors Corp. Several methods are currently used to enforce motion in different types of noise and vibration models. Experimentally based FRF models often use a matrix inversion technique to enforce motion. In finite element models, the large mass method is one that is very commonly used. A literature review has shown few guidelines for determining the size of these large masses. In this paper, the rela- tionship between the matrix inversion technique and the large mass method is derived. From this relationship, conditions necessary for these large mass FEM models to converge to the same answers as the matrix inversion technique are derived. These conditions are then used to develop a criterion for determining a smallest possible large mass. Results from a simple model are presented to demon- strate the criterion. 2001-01-1410. Investigation of wiper blade squeal noise reduction measures. Shiny a Goto, DENSO Corp.; Hiroshi Takahashi, ASMO Co., Ltd.; and Tokio Oy a, Meiji Univ. As automobiles become quieter, wiper operation noise becomes more noticeable. Squeal noise is one type of wiper operation noise. It is a high-frequency self-excited vibration that is easily generated before and after the wiper reverses direction. In analyzing this vibration, squeal noise was observed using a rotary disk system. Then FEM was applied to deduce an equation of motion that reflects the observation results. The equation suggests material and configuration approaches toward reducing squeal noise. Potential measures include improvement in the blade damping coefficient, reduction in the coefficient of friction by surface treat- ment, and an increase in neck thickness, etc. Implementation of these measures reduced squeal noise. 2001-01-1411. Sound transmission through elastomeric seal- ing systems. Junhong Park, Thomas Siegmund, and Luc G. Mongeau, Purdue Univ. The sound barrier performance of elastomeric vehicle weather seals was investigated. Experiments were performed for one bulb seal specimen following a reverberation room method. The seal wall vibration was measured using a laser doppler vibrometer. The acoustic pressure near the seal surface was measured simulta- neously, allowing the sound intensities on both side of the seal, and the sound transmission loss to be evaluated. The vibration response of the bulb seal and its sound transmission loss were then computed using the finite element method. Model predictions for the same seal geometry were found to be in excellent agreement with the experi- mental data within the frequency range of interest, comprised between 500 Hz and 4000 Hz. 2001-01-1412. On the evaluation of radiated sound field of engine covers. K. L. Hong, P. Tathavadekar, and S. T. Raveendra, Collins &amp; Aikman Corp. Acoustical performance of many NVH systems is evaluated by computing the radiated noise of such systems. Although the compu- tation of relevant acoustical quantities such as the radiation effi- ciency and sound power can be performed by using approximate method such as the Rayleigh integral method, in most instances rig- orous methods such as the boundary element method is preferred. Unfortunately the boundary element method for radiation problems fails at the eigenfrequencies associated with the interior cavity. Additionally, in most instances the acoustical performance is needed to be evaluated over a range of frequencies and in a traditional boundary element system this evaluation is performed indepen- dently at each discrete frequency. In this presentation, issues associ- ated with the accuracy and efficiency of these solutions are 183</page><page sequence="183">2001-01-1412-2001-01-1418 addressed by investigating the solution of progressively more com- plex industrial problems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1413. Modeling the vibro-acoustical behavior of composite multi-layered systems. Roland Woodcock and Gordon Ebbitt, Lear Corp. Composite multi-layered systems are of particular interest in the automotive industry since the design of the various components in an efficient sound package requires a good predictive model. The state of the art in this matter shows that the medium- and high- frequency ranges are well mastered in terms of predictive tools based on infinite models. But this is not the case for the lower fre- quency range. The paper will start with a discussion of the medium- and high- frequency range where, for example, the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is an efficient framework to predict the acoustical properties of multi-layer materials. Emphasis will be put on correlation data obtained with a variety of multi-layer systems. In the low-frequency range the use of infinite models leads to sig- nificant discrepancies. In the present paper the authors propose a finite 'hybrid type' formulation which combines the advantages of both single-layer and multi-layer approaches of stratified composite structures. From a structural point of view, the description includes the effect of bending, membrane and shear waves by means of the displacement field. The generality of the composite is extended to include anisotropic properties. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is used to derive the equations of motion. One of the features of this method is that the size of the system involved in the calculation does not increase with the number of layers. The vibro-acoustical behavior can then be deduced to give the main acoustical properties of the multi-layer material. The efficiency and the application of the pro- posed modeling method will be illustrated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1414. Development of the 2002 Buick Rendezvous body structure. Anthony Banner , Brian Deutschet Michael Dam- bach, and Paul Juras , General Motors Corp. This paper documents the development of the 2002 Buick Ren- dezvous body structure for optimum noise &amp; vibration performance. Accelerated vehicle development timing demanded clearly defined body structure vibration performance targets, with critical depen- dence on math based modeling. The 2002 Buick Rendezvous was truly a fast-to-math program enabled partially by borrowing some of its structural features from the recently launched Pontiac Aztek Competitive performance data collected for the Aztek was tai- lored to the Rendezvous for setting major global body structure tar- gets. Architectural differences in overall vehicle size and body opening configuration led to adjustments in body matchboxing, bending and torsional requirements. The frequency domain 'mode map' was modified to these requirements taking into account the Buick Brand Character. Computer simulation models were used exclusively to predict body structural performance. A coarse full-body structure model was used to define body structure section size and joint require- ments. Detailed analysis models of body joint areas were used to synthesize the joint design. A detailed model of the nonferrous end- gate was used extensively to match function with form. This process led the design efforts to minimizing body structure mass while optimizing vibration performance. A comprehensive measurement plan was executed to confirm the frequency performance of the body structure. Modal tests were per- formed at several points in the prototype body build process to con- firm math-based predictions. The 2002 Buick Rendezvous has four swing doors and rear liftgate which greatly improves the body struc- ture vibration performance. Compared with previous generation vans the Rendezvous has increased body structure stiffness of 26%, 21% and 39% in the first three global body structure frequencies. 2001-01-1415. Noise and vibration reduction technology in hybrid vehicle development. Takayoshi Yoshioka and Hiroshi Sugita, Toyota Motor Corp. The world's first mass production gasoline hybrid passenger car, the 'Prius,' was introduced into the Japanese market in 1997. By the time it was introduced into the American and European markets in Mid- 2000, its fuel consumption and exhaust emissions had been fur- ther improved while achieving superior NV performance compared with conventional vehicles with 1.5-liter engines even in these com- petitive markets. This paper describes NV reduction technology for problems peculiar to the hybrid vehicle such as engine start/stop vibration, drone noise and vibration at low engine speed and motor/ generator noise and vibration. It also compares the overall NV per- formance of the hybrid vehicle with conventional gasoline engine vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1416. Effects of boundary conditions on the natural modes of transmission ring gear structure. Romil P. Tanna and Teik C. Lim , University of Alabama. The natural modes of the ring gear structure commonly used in automotive transmissions are predicted using the finite element approach, and the sensitivities of these modes to boundary condi- tions between the housing and ring gear are analyzed. The specific boundary conditions of interest include free-free, simply-supports at equally spaced angular points, and discrete and distributed spring elements. For the free-free boundary condition, clear well-defined modes are observed that can be classified into four fundamental groups corresponding to radial inextensional, extensional, out-of- plane bending and pure torsional. However, when other boundary conditions are applied the mode shapes become more complex. For instance, in the simply-supported case the radial inextensional and torsional modes are seen to appear highly distorted. Also, the natural frequencies of these modes are higher than the free-free ones. The radial inextensional modes and the out-of-plane bending modes are seen to have substantial effect on vibration transmissibility. Tor- sional modes occur at relatively high frequency, and have less severe effects on vibration transmissibility as compared to the radial inextensional and out-of-plane bending modes. Extensional modes are quite insensitive to boundary conditions, and they occur at com- paratively much higher frequency values that are practically out of the gear whine spectrum range. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1417. Manufacturing robustness analysis of the noise excitation and design of alternative gear sets. Donald R. Houser and Jonny Harianto, Ohio State Univ. Transmission errors, axial shuttling forces, and friction result in bearing forces that serve as the major excitations of gear noise. This paper focuses on a comparison of these factors, as well as stresses for two designs: one being an original product design and the second being a slightly finer pitch design that has the equivalent design life of the original design. The original gear design shows higher trans- mission errors and bearing forces, thus creating more noise than the finer pitch gear pair. It was noted from testing that no matter how the profile and lead modifications to the original coarse pitch gear pair were changed, it was difficult to make it quieter. On the other hand, no matter how the profile and lead modifications to the finer pitch gear pair were changed, it was difficult to make it noisy. This paper shows the effects of different profiles and leads for the gear pairs on noise excitations and stresses. Furthermore, a robustness analysis that shows the sensitivity of the two designs to manufactur- ing errors is presented. The analyses essentially corroborate the experimental observations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1418. Modeling system dynamic coupling in powertrain-like structures. Ren Pan and Teik C. Lim , University of Alabama; and Keith A. Hollman , Rodney C. Glover , and David S. Totten , Eaton Innovation Center. 184</page><page sequence="184">2001-01-1418-2001-01-1423 The feasibility of applying a dynamic sub-structuring approach to model and analyze the vibration response of critical automotive components in its coupled vehicle state is examined using an ideal- ized beam-flange-plate system. The beam-flange component is regarded as the primary component of interest while the plate is assumed to be the base structure. Both modal and spectral-based for- mulations are considered, which account for the true dynamic cou- pling/interaction between the component of interest and base struc- ture. For the modal-based sub- structuring approach, a unique mod- eling scheme that utilizes a set of multi-point constraint equations for representing the transformation matrix between the modal coor- dinates of the base structure and the physical coordinates of the pri- mary component is applied. On the other hand, the spectral-based approach relies on the frequency response functions of the base structure directly to predict the overall system response spectra. The former method is generally found to work well in systems with lightly damped, well-separated resonances, while the latter one can be used to analyze structures with higher modal density and damp- ing characteristics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1419. Influence of dynamic damper pulley design on engine front noise. Tetsuji Morita and Yasushi Tsuna , NOK- Vibracoustic Co ., Ltd. ; and Atsushi Okada, Isuzu Motors Limited. Recently, there is an increasing trend to use dynamic damper pul- leys for the reduction of both crankshaft vibration and engine noise. By attachment of a dynamic damper pulley, the vibration level of a crankshaft is always significantly reduced, whereas sometimes the engine noise level shows only little reduction. The reasons are not yet understood. For a four-cylinder, in-line-type diesel engine the influence of the damper design on engine noise was investigated. Two dynamic damper pulleys which have the same torsional natural frequency but different designs were attached to the crankshaft front end. The axial vibrations of the dynamic damper pulleys were measured together with radiated noise in front of the engine, under operating condi- tions. The resulting noise reductions at the engine front were very different. In the worst cases, significant resonance peaks were seen at about 1 KHz. A series of experiments made the influence of the damper design clear. In addition to the design study, a rubber noise cover was developed to shield noise radiation from dynamic damper pulleys. With it, attached to the dynamic damper pulley, the engine front noise overall level in the near field was reduced by an additional 2 dBA to 3 dBA over the whole engine speed range. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1420. Prediction technique for vibration of power- plant with elastic crankshaft system. Kenichi Y amas hita, Hitoshi Yamashita, and Mitsuo Nakano, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Cen- ter , Ltd.; and Hideo Okamura , Okamura NVH Laboratory. The dynamic behaviors of power-plant have much effect on inte- rior noises and vibrations of passenger cars, especially, in the fre- quency range below 1000 Hz. So it is very important to estimate the vibrations of power-plant at the design stage. To predict the dynamic behaviors of power-plant including the rotating elastic crankshaft system, the time domain dynamic simulation methods have been applied, however such analyses require much time and resource of computer. In this report, the exciting forces to the cylinder block are derived in the frequency domain from both the dynamic stiffness of bearing oil films and the dynamic displacements of crankshaft journals, so that the computation time is reduced considerably. To estimate the displacements of the crankshaft journals, the vibrations of an engine crankshaft system including crank journal oil films under firing conditions are calculated using the dynamic stiffness matrix method in the frequency domain. The displacements derived in the crankshaft coordinate system are substituted into the engine block coordinate system to estimate the exciting forces to cylinder block. The dynamic stiffness of bearing oil films is calcu- lated by applying the Sommerfeld numbers for each main bearing under operating conditions. The exciting forces in the frequency domain are calculated by applying both the displacements and the stiffness of bearing oil films. Finally, by applying those forces to the finite element model of the power-plant, the acceleration responses of power-plant vibrations are obtained. 2001-01-1421. Experimental modal analysis for cylinder block-crankshaft substructure systems of six-cylinder in-line diesel engines. Hideo Okamura , Okamura NVH Laboratory; and Susumu Arai, Hino Motors, Ltd. A newly developed OHC (Over-Head Camshaft) prototype of a six-cylinder in-line diesel engine (with bore size: 114 mm, stroke size: 130 mm) was studied, comparing with the previous version of OHV (Over-Head Valve)-type engine (with bore size: 110 mm, stroke size: 130 mm). It was found that the new type of cylinder block (with 130.8 kg of mass) has significantly lower natural fre- quencies than those for the previous type of cylinder block (with 133.2 kg of mass). Furthermore, slightly more predominant engine noise and vibration were induced in the new engine. The vibration behavior and the excitation force transmission characteristics were investigated by EMA (Experimental Modal Analysis). We performed a series of impact tests for (1) free-free cylinder block, (2) free-free crankshaft substructure with torsional damper and flywheel attached, and (3) the case where (1) and (2) are assembled together. In the testings, we measured the accelera- tion response for 77 measuring points for (1), and 42 points for (2), each in the X-Y-Z directions, over a frequency range of 0~2000 Hz. In addition to the modal parameters (natural frequencies, mode shapes and mode damping factors) for (l),(2),and (3), the transfer functions between the excitation forces applied on the cylinder lin- ers and crankshaft main bearings, and the acceleration responses at the cylinder block surface. For the crankshaft substructure assem- bled in the cylinder block, we investigated the coupling behavior between the crankshaft vibrations and the cylinder block vibrations, for the cases (a) when the thrust bearing is attached, and (b) when the thrust bearing is removed. By a series of experiments, we learned substantially important knowledge for the vibration behaviors of (l),(2),and(3). Further- more we found that the EMA approach is quite straightforward, effi- cient and reliable for such research. 2001-01-1422. Power steering pump with enhanced cold-start priming. Leonard F. Bishop and John K. Abraham, Visteon Corp. The objective of the present work was to improve the cold-start NVH performance of an automotive power steering pump under low-temperature conditions. This objective was accomplished through the use experimental study and measurement. The satisfactory operation of a fixed displacement vane pump in cold temperatures depends on a number of factors including; (1) fill- ing characteristics, (2) the inlet conditions to the pump, (3) the fluid, and (4) the ability of the vanes to maintain contact with the cam sur- face. In this investigation, factor (4) was chosen for investigation. A unique outlet orifice was designed and tested at three different oper- ating ambient temperatures, -19°C, -29°C, and -40°C. Maximum 'noise' duration was measured as the maximum duration of fluid- borne pump outlet pressure oscillations greater the 345 kPa peak-to- peak. The results show that noise duration can reduced by as much as 50% at - 40°C. Selected results of this experimental study are pres- ented and discussed. 2001-01-1423.

Evaporative emission control system purge solenoid valves in passenger cars and light-duty trucks are a noise source that engen- ders customer complaint. Valve-only noise tests produce results that 185</page><page sequence="185">2001-01-1423-2001-01-1430 are inconsistent with measured system noise. Such tests fail to account for variables introduced in situ. This study investigates valve-induced structure-borne noise as the major source of system noise. It researches a theoretical method to relate structure-borne purge solenoid system noise requirements, valve-only, and vehicle mounting system dynamic requirements. It aims to validate the researched method and determine the nature of a valve-only bench test and a mounting system dynamic test. Several systems' noise levels, inertance, and acoustic responses were measured. The bench test vibration for each solenoid valve was also measured. This study discovered that the internal force of the purge solenoid may change with the mounting system compliance. To produce an accurate bench test, it might be necessary to account for this fluctuation. The data collected by provisional tests validated the proposed methods. These tests, while more accurate than any previous tests, still require modification in order to predict with an accuracy demanded by today's competitive market. 2001-01-1424. Serpentine accessory belt drive tool: Virtual prototyping for V-ribbed belt drives. Yeongching Lin, Huihua Shen, Craig Scholar, Richard Meckstroth, and Gary Toth, Ford Motor Co. Serpentine accessory belts are commonly used in industries such as automotive and general machinery. The purpose of this analytical tool is to provide design engineers the capability to model belt drive systems using ADAMS (Automated Dynamic Analysis of Mechani- cal Systems). The generated ADAMS models can be used to analyze several different characteristics concerning V-Ribbed belt drive sys- tems. The general solution of the governing nonlinear equations pro- vides the coupled longitudinal and transverse response of the trans- lating belt drive system. Typical simulation outputs include pulley hubloads, belt impact dynamic forces, and belt slip rates at the pulleys. 2001-01-1425. An investigation of rotational response of accessory drive serpentine belt system. J. S. Sandhu, M. K. Wehrly, W. F. Resh, and B. A. Rose, DaimlerChrysler Corp. Serpentine belt system has been widely used during past years to drive automotive accessories like power steering, alternator, and A/C compressor from a crankshaft pulley. Instead of using multiple belt drives, the serpentine belt system uses a multi-rib flat belt, which wraps around several idlers and accessory pulleys. This design requires the use of a tensioning device to maintain adequate belt tension for preventing slip. Crankshaft torsional vibrations can lead to excessive rotational vibrations in poorly designed accessory systems. This can lead to undesirable noise and excessive slip, which can hamper the belt and bearing life. The value of these rota- tional frequencies and system response is of utmost interest to the accessory drive designer. While it is not practical to shift these rota- tional frequencies out of the operating range of an engine, a belt lay- out with these frequencies at non-dwell engine speed is highly desir- able. The presence of a tensioner induces non-linearity since the ten- sioner arm motion changes the adjacent belt span lengths and hence the stiffness. The coulomb friction in the tensioner arm can lead to stick-slip motion of the arm that can induce a higher harmonic response. Thus, standard linear vibration analysis tools cannot be used to predict the response, and one must resort to numerically inte- grating the equation of motion. A modular integration technique is suggested where an accessory drive system model can be generated by assembling pre-defined blocks which capture the behavior of individual components like tensioner, belt span, and accessory pul- ley. Implementation of this model into commercially available soft- ware is accomplished easily. The system model is excited by a sine sweep signal to determine the response under entire operating range. By predicting the dynamic response of an accessory layout the effect of a design change is determined rapidly, thus reducing the develop- ment time. 2001-01-1428. Sounddesign - The BMW inline six-cylinder engine in different vehicle applications. Udo Lindner and Andreas Mueller, NVH Gasoline Engines. The new inline six-cylinder engine from BMW notoriously sets new standards on objective performance in power and torque and fuel consumption as well as on 'Laufkultur' (engine refinement). It has been a general movement in recent years to design engines that not only perform, but also improve driver's feedback for perfor- mance on an emotional level. New is the degree of differentiation of this new engine through distinctive sound design for the whole bandwidth of vehicle categories ranging from a 5-Series luxury sedan to a Z3 roadster, or an X5 sports utility vehicle to a 3 -Series compact car. For each BMW class, the intake and exhaust systems of the inline 6-cylinder engines have been tuned to highlight the subjective impression of performance according to the appropriate vehicle type. 2001-01-1429. Flow noise reduction upon quick opening the throttle. Yoshihiro Nakase, Kenji Kanehara, and Kouzi Ohara, Nip- pon Soken Inc.; and Kenichi Yamamoto, and Yoshihiro Miyaji, Toyota Motor Corp. With the advance in modularization of engine parts in recent years, there is increased use of plastic-made products in air intake systems. Plastic-made intake manifolds provide many advantages including reduced weight, reduced cost, and lower intake air temper- atures. However, these manifolds have one disadvantage when com- pared with conventional aluminum-made intake manifolds, in that they transmit more noise because of their lower material density. For example, plastic intake manifolds of early development often generate flow noise when the throttle is opened quickly. With con- ventional aluminum intake manifolds, this flow noise had generated, but was not heard. This flow noise is presumed to be generated because of high-speed airflow generated when the throttle is opened quickly, but the mechanism of this noise generation has not been clarified. This paper discusses the mechanism of flow noise genera- tion upon quick opening of the throttle, and the methods devised by the authors that can reduce flow noise. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1430. Flow-acoustic coupling in quarter-wave reso- nators using computational fluid dynamics. Paul M. Radavich and Ahmet Selamet, Ohio State Univ.; and James M. Novak, Ford Motor Co. Quarter-wave resonators are commonly used as acoustic silenc- ers in automotive air induction systems. Similar closed side branches can also be formed in the idle air bypass, exhaust gas recir- culation, and positive crankcase ventilation systems of engines. The presence of a mean flow across these side branches can lead to an interaction between the mean flow and the acoustic resonances of the side branch. At discrete flow conditions, this coupling between the flow and acoustic fields may product high amplitude acoustic pressure pulsations. For the quarter-wave resonator, this interaction can turn the silencer into a noise generator, while for systems where a valve is located at the closed end of the side branch the large pres- sure pulsations can cause the valve to fail. This phenomenon is not limited to automotive applications, and also occurs in natural gas pipelines, aircraft, and numerous other internal and external flows. The present approach solves the interaction between the mean flow and the acoustic field by employing the unsteady, turbulent, and compressible Navier-Stokes equations computationally. Experimen- tal comparisons reveal that this method is capable of determining when flow-acoustic coupling occurs and how variations in the geometry and flow conditions influence the acoustic pressure amplitudes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 186</page><page sequence="186">2001-01-1431-2001-01-1438 2001-01-1431. Air intake development - Effects of coupled fluid/structure modes. Matthias Alex , FILTERWERK MANN+HUMMEL GmbH. The design of an air intake system has to be a compromise between several system targets. In the past these conflicts were solved with experimental test on the first prototype parts. To shorten the development times more and more computational programs in the concept phase are used. ID simulation programs are based on the transfer matrix method or use the output of gas exchange programs to simulate the acoustic behavior of air intake systems. These tools do usually neglect the coupled fluid/structure modes. Measurements on a simple air cleaner design have shown that these coupling can not be ignored on typical air cleaner designs. The difference between internal and external pressure leads to an increase of the air cleaner volume which shifts the first resonance to a lower engine speed. This paper shows a method which can be used in ID simulation programs to allow the prediction of orifice noise of air intake systems. 2001-01-1432. Sound design in the passenger compartment with active noise control in the air intake system. Franc Pricken , FILTERWERK MANN+HUMMEL GmbH. In the future, the requirements of acoustic behavior in air intake systems will continue to increase. Active systems will be necessary to reach the higher legislative standards and customer expectations regarding noise levels. The optimization of the Active Noise Control System regarding the sound design in the interior is based on the transfer function between the engine and the passenger compartment as well as the design of the air intake system. This paper shows the development process, with a focus on the investigation of transfer functions in passenger cars and the compu- tational calculation for the system configuration. 2001-01-1433. Exhaust manifold radiated noise prediction methodology. Ming Zhou , Jim Emery , Steven H. Dropps, and Mario Felice, Ford Motor Co. The spark ignition engine is a prime source of vibration energy. NVH disturbances generated by the engine ultimately reach the cus- tomer in the form of objectionable noise or NVH. Exhaust Mani- folds are one of the many sources of noise contributors among the engine components. Often, the exhaust manifold is identified as a source of objectionable NVH late in the design and development process. Due to the lack of an upfront NVH analysis tool, a new CAE NVH methodology for evaluating new exhaust manifold designs has been investigated and developed by the Ford Motor Company's V-Engine CAE and Exhaust Manifold Design Sections. This new CAE methodology has been developed to compare the NVH perfor- mance of current production exhaust manifolds to new design levels. Mechanical induced radiated shell noise is the predominate cause of objectionable NVH in exhaust manifolds. However, flow- induced noise caused by the engine exhaust pulsation and wave dynamics also contributes to the radiated shell noise and should therefore be included in the analysis. This paper will describe the two analytical approaches that were investigated. Method 1 : The structural-mechanical approach is considered by including base engine excitation of crank train and valve train mechanical loads. Method 2: The mechanism of flow-induced noise is studied by applying engine pulsation and flow pressure fluctuation as acoustic excitations in coupled structure-acoustic model. The overall radiated noise levels are determined by superposition of both base and flow- induced excitations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1434. Determining the link between the disturbing sound elements and the construction of the exhaust system. L. Dedene, M. Van Overmeire, and P. Guillaume, University of Brus- sels; and Rudi Valgaeren, BOSAL Research N. V. An investigation of the disturbing sound elements of automotive exhaust noise will be discussed (e.g., whistle, raspy, boom). The investigation is performed in three steps. First a sound catalogue is established with a definition for each disturbing element. Subse- quently, for each of these disturbing elements a metric is deter- mined. This paper is focused on the final step, which consists in determining the link between each metric and the construction of the exhaust system. The case of a whistle generated by a perforated tube will be discussed. Another element that will be discussed is putter, which occurs and the end of the coast-down, before the transition to idle rpm. 2001-01-1435. Acoustic attenuation performance of perfo- rated absorbing silencers. A. Selamet, I. J. Lee, and Z. L. Ji, Ohio State Univ.; and N. T. Huff, Owens Corning Inc. The acoustic attenuation performance of a single-pass, perforated concentric silencer filled with continuous strand fibers is investi- gated theoretically and experimentally. One-dimensional analytical and three-dimensional boundary element methods are employed to predict the acoustic attenuation in the absence of mean flow. Mea- sured complex characteristic impedance and wave number are used to account for the wave propagation through absorbing fiber. The perforation impedance facing the fiber is also presented in terms of the complex characteristic impedance and wave number. The effects of perforate duct porosity and the fiber density are examined. Com- parisons of predictions with the experiments illustrate the need for multidimensional analysis at higher frequencies, while the one- dimensional treatment provides a reasonable accuracy at lower fre- quencies, as expected. The study also shows a significant improve- ment in the acoustic attenuation of the silencer due to fiber absorption. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1436. A new type of silencers for turbocharger noise control. Eric P. Trochon, PSA Peugeot Citroen. Silencers are a very effective way to reduce two of the most severe kinds of turbocharger noises, called 'pulsation' noise and 'blow' noise. PSA has developed its own silencer design based on a combination of a Herschel-Quincke tube and two quarter-wave resonators. The new device has a transmission loss of over 15 dB from 1600 to 3400 Hz. It will be first applied on the 2001 Peugeot 406 and Citroen C5. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1437. Dynamic simulation and correlation for auto- motive exhaust systems. Xitian Fang, Mehmet Ciray, and Yin Chen, ArvinMeritor Inc. This paper deals with the dynamic simulation of an automotive exhaust system. Selection of dynamic loads, processing of test data, determination of damping ratio and nonlinear stiffness are explained in detail. Validation of CAE model to test data is also included. It will be shown that the failure location was successfully predicted using modal analysis, and the dynamic stresses were correlated with the dynamic analysis at the failure location. 2001-01-1438. Dynamic analysis of a full system durability test in vehicle exhaust systems. Deming Wan and Christy Simms, ArvinMeritor Inc. A vehicle exhaust system model is implemented into the verified vibration table model. (A dynamic model of the Multi- Axial Simu- lation Table (MAST) was presented at the SAE 2000 World Con- gress, Paper No. 2000-01-1187.) The ultimate motivation of this model is to develop and demonstrate advanced dynamic modeling tools in exhaust system design, especially in predicting 'what if sit- uations. The process of the vehicle exhaust system model develop- ment is described and the results of a correlation study between the 187</page><page sequence="187">2001-01-1438-2001-01-1445 dynamic model analysis, the Full System Durability Test experi- ments, and the vehicle four-poster tests are presented in this paper. Both sinusoidal and proving ground excitations are used in the experiment. A dynamic model of the rubber isolator is also briefly discussed. 2001-01-1439. Identification of the best modal parameters and strategies for FE model updating. Jeroen Deweer and Tom Van Langenhove, LMS International ; and Scott Grinker , ArvinMeri- tor. The use of numerical models as basis to assemble or modify all kinds of new structures is increasing over the last years. This has as benefit that it reduces the number of expensive, physical proto- types. These numerical models however must be verified and vali- dated against measured data. Updating is generally needed to guar- antee accurate correspondence with reality. This paper focuses on an exhaust. It describes the different steps of the complete process from the acquisition till the updating. On the measurement side, some typical acquisition measures and an efficient approach to handle (slightly) inconsistent data sets is explained. On the numerical side, it is investigated how to achieve the final updated exhaust with physical relevant characteristics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1440. Engine intake noise modeling by using a time/ frequency approach. G. Chiatti and O. Chiavola , University of ( Roma Tre'. A predictive technique aimed at investigating the behaviour of intake and exhaust systems of internal combustion engine and at evaluating their influence on engine breathing and radiated noise is herewith presented. Such a technique is based on coupling a time domain gas dynamic model (composed of zero-dimensional, one- dimensional and three-dimensional methods) with a frequency domain linear acoustic analysis (transfer matrix method); thus a realistic prediction of complete engine systems is realised by adopt- ing in each region the most appropriate method, according to the main features of the phenomena involved. The whole procedure has been applied to the intake system of an automotive engine and the results regarding different operative conditions are presented. 2001-01-1441. Transfer path analysis of structure-borne shock absorber noise in a passenger car. Joon-Ho Lee , Kyoung Oh, and Youn-Sik Park, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; and Dae-Hun Gwon, and Sang-Kyu Park, Korea Auto- motive Systems Co. This paper describes a method to separate structure-borne noise, which comes from the shock absorber, from the measured vehicle interior sound pressure. The transfer path analysis (TPA) was used. Shock absorber was considered as an input source while the sound pressure at the driver seat as its output. It was found that the sound pressure at the driver seat position and accelerations at the shock absorber mounting points are strongly correlated. Using one-third octave band analysis, the contribution of shock absorber structure- borne noise to the driver seat sound pressure was analyzed. Also the relationship between the measured acceleration and sound pressure was studied. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1442. The effects of different input excitation on the dynamic characterization of an automotive shock absorber. Darin Kowalski, Mohan D. Rao, Jason Blough, and Scott Gruen- berg, Michigan Technological Univ.; and Dave Griffiths, Ford Motor Co. This paper deals with the dynamic characterization of an automo- tive shock absorber, a continuation of an earlier work. The objective of this on-going research is to develop a testing and analysis meth- odology for obtaining dynamic properties of automotive shock absorbers for use in CAE-NVH low-to-mid frequency chassis mod- els. First, the effects of temperature and nominal length on the stiff- ness and damping of the shock absorber are studied and their impor- tance in the development of a standard test method discussed. The effects of different types of input excitation on the dynamic proper- ties of the shock absorber are then examined. Stepped sine sweep excitation is currently used in industry to obtain shock absorber parameters along with their frequency and amplitude dependence. Sine-on-sine testing, which involves excitation using two different sine waves has been done in this study to understand the effects of the presence of multiple sine waves on the estimated dynamic prop- erties. In an effort to obtain all frequency dependent parameters simultaneously, different types of broadband random excitations have been studied. Results are compared with stepped sine sweep tests. Additionally, actual road data measured on different road pro- files has been used as input excitation to obtain the shock absorber parameters for broad frequency bands under realistic amplitude and frequency conditions. These results are compared with both simu- lated random excitation and stepped sine sweep test results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1443. Testing elastomers - Can correlation be achieved between machines, load cells, fixtures and operators? Scott Gruenberg, Michigan Technological Univ.; Michael Audo, DaimlerChrysler Corp.; and John Reddaway, Tenneco Automotive. At present, testing elastomeric parts is performed at a level dic- tated by the users of the testing equipment. No society or testing group has defined a formal standard of testing or a way to calibrate a testing machine. This is in part due to the difficulty involved with testing a material whose properties are in a constant state of flux. To further complicate this issue, testing equipment, testing proce- dures, fixtures, and a host of other variables including the operators themselves, all can have an impact on the characterization of elasto- mers. The work presented in this paper looks at identifying some of the variables of testing between machines, load cells, fixtures and operators. It also shows that correlation can be achieved and should be performed between companies to ensure data integrity. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1444. Examination of high frequency characteriza- tion methods for mounts. Seungbo Kim and Rajendra Singh, Ohio State Univ. The knowledge of frequency-dependent dynamic stiffnesses of mounts, in axial and flexural motions, is needed to determine the behavior of many automotive sub-systems. Consequently, charac- terization and modeling of vibration isolators is increasingly becom- ing more important in mid and high frequency regimes where very few methods are known to exist. This paper critically examines some of the approximate identification methods that have been pro- posed in the literature. Then we present a new experimental identifi- cation method that yields frequency-dependent multi-dimensional dynamic stiffnesses of an isolator. The scope is however limited to a linear time-invariant system and our analysis is restricted to the frequency domain. The new characterization method uses two iner- tial elements at both ends of an isolator and free boundary condi- tions are maintained during testing. Multi-dimensional mobility syn- thesis formulation is also developed to predict the behavior of over- all system, and the decomposed motilities of mount are extracted using synthesized mobilities. The proposed identification method is applied to one simulation example and one practical rubber isolator, and experimental results are successfully compared with data mea- sured on commercial equipment for axial motions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1445. A stiffness optimization procedure for auto- mobile rubber mounts. Nobutaka Tsujiuchi, Takayuki Koizumi, and Takaaki Takenaka, Doshisha Univ.; and Tomoyuki Iwagase, TOYO TIRE &amp; RUBBER Co., Ltd. Generally, it is well known that road noise generated by vibration from automobile tires and suspensions can be reduced by changing the stiffness of the rubber mounts installed in the suspension sys- 188</page><page sequence="188">2001-01-1445-2001-01-1452 tems. Such stiffness, however, is rarely changed to avoid riding dis- comfort and so on. In this paper, a stiffness optimization method for suspension sys- tem rubber mounts that reduces road noise, and improves riding comfort as well, is presented. In the process, Road Noise Contribu- tion Analysis (RNCA) is applied to the target vehicle to specify the major factors of road noise. Furthermore, the suspension system of the vehicle is investigated by Sensitivity Analysis using Measured FRF data (SAMF) to identify the optimal stiffness combination of rubber mounts. As a result, an effective stiffness combination of two mounts is specified to reduce road noise and to improve riding comfort. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1446. Measurement of dynamic parameters of auto- motive exhaust hangers. Mohan D. Rao and Scott Gruenberg , Michigan Technological Univ.,ś and Dave Griffiths , Ford Motor Co. Different methodologies to test and analyze the dynamic stiffness (K) and damping (C) properties of several silicone and EPDM rub- ber automotive exhaust hangers were investigated in this research. One test method utilized a standard MTS hydraulic test machine with a single sine excitation at discrete frequencies and amplitude levels, while a second method utilized an electrodynamic shaker with broadband excitation. Analysis techniques for extracting the equivalent stiffness and damping were developed in the shaker tests using data from time domain, frequency domain, as well as force transmissibility. A comparison of all of the shaker testing methods for repeatability and accuracy was done with the goal of determining the appropriate method that generates the most consistent results over the range of testing. The shaker testing in the frequency domain using a frequency response function model produced good results and the set-up is relatively inexpensive. The hydraulic excitation method, however, is more suitable for large displacements and is ideal to study the variations of K and C with frequency, displace- ment, temperature and pre-load. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1447. Application of elastomeric components for noise and vibration isolation in the automotive industry. Craig Lewitzke and Ping Lee , General Motors Corp. Elastomeric isolators are used in a variety of different applica- tions to reduce noise and vibration. To use isolators effectively requires the product design and development engineer to satisfy multiple objectives, which typically include packaging restrictions, environmental criteria, limitations on motion control, load require- ments, and minimum fatigue life, in addition to vibration isolation performance. An understanding of elastomeric material properties and the methods used to characterize elastomeric component behav- ior is necessary to achieve desired performance. Typical design criteria and functional objectives for various isolator applications, including powertrain mounts, suspension control arm bushings, shock absorber bushings, exhaust hangers, flexible couplings, cradle mounts, body mounts and vibration dampers are also discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1448. Transmission mount design considerations for a longitudinally mounted powertrain. Basem Alzahabi, Kettering Univ.; and Scott C. Simon, General Motors Car Group. The transmission mount in a powertrain mounting system is often a primary path for noise. This is especially the case when the transmission is mounted directly to the body without the benefit of a structural frame or isolation between the bracket and body. Since most transmissions generate frequencies above 150 Hz, the trans- mission mount system becomes a likely noise path for this and higher frequencies. A combination of very stiff transmission bracket and very soft rubber mount between the transmission bracket and the transmission would help this problem. In this paper, the development an opti- mally designed transmission mount for a longitudinally mounted powertrain is presented. The development procedure of such a design considers the transmission mount as part of the total system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1449. The effects of natural aging on fleet and dura- bility vehicle engine mounts from a dynamic characterization perspective. Scott Gruenberg, Jason Blough, and Darin Kowalski, Michigan Technological Univ.; and Jay Pistana, General Motors Corp. Elastomers are traditionally designed for use in applications that require specific mechanical properties. Unfortunately, these proper- ties change with respect to many different variables including heat, light, fatigue, oxygen, ozone, and the catalytic effects of trace ele- ments. When elastomeric mounts are designed for NVH use in vehi- cles, they are designed to isolate specific unwanted frequencies. As the elastomers age however, the desired elastomeric properties may have changed with time. This study looks at the variability seen in new vehicle engine mounts and how the dynamic properties change with respect to miles accumulated on fleet and durability test vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1451. Vibrational power flow and its application to a passenger car for identification of vibration transmission path. Sang-Kwon Lee, Ki-Sung Park, Min-Sung Lee, Kyoun-Rae Rho, and Jang-Sun Sim, Inha Univ.; and Joong-Hee Kim, Renault Samsung Motors Co. Korea. Reduction of structure-borne noise in the compartment of a car is an important task in automotive engineering. Transfer path analy- sis using the vibroacoustic reciprocity technique or multiple path decomposition method has generally been used for structure-borne noise path analysis. These methods are useful for solving a particu- lar problem, but they do not quantify the effectiveness of vibration isolation of each isolator of a vehicle. To quantify the effectiveness of vibration isolation, vibrational power flow has been used for a simple isolation system or a laboratory-based isolation system. It is often difficult to apply the vibrational power flow technique to a complex isolation system like a car. In this paper, a simple equation is derived for calculation of the vibrational power flow of an isola- tion system with multiple isolators such as a car. It is successfully applied not only to quantifying the relative contributions of eighteen isolators, but also to reducing the structure-borne noise of a passen- ger car. According to the results, the main contributor of the eigh- teen isolators is the rear roll mount of an engine. The reduced struc- ture-borne noise level is about 5 dB A. 2001-01-1452. Vibration power transmission through multi- dimensional isolation paths over high frequencies. Seungbo Kim and Rajendra Singh, Ohio State Univ. In many vibration isolation problems, translational motion has been regarded as a major contributor to the energy transmitted from a source to a receiver. However, the rotational components of isola- tion paths must be incorporated as the frequency range of interest increases. This article focuses on the flexural motion of an elasto- meric isolator but the longitudinal motion is also considered. In this study, the isolator is modeled using the Timoshenko beam theory (flexural motion) and the wave equation (longitudinal motion), and linear, time-invariant system assumption is made throughout this study. Two different frequency response characteristics of an elasto- meric isolator are predicted by the Timoshenko beam theory and are compared with its subsets. A rigid body is employed for the source and the receiver is modeled using two alternate formulations: an infinite beam and then a finite beam. Power transmission efficiency concept is employed to quantify the isolation achieved. Further, vibration power components are also examined. The roles of isolator parameters such as the static stiffness ratios, shape factors and mate- rial properties are investigated. 189</page><page sequence="189">2001-01-1453-2001-01-1460 2001-01-1453. An elementary simulation of vibration isola- tion characteristics of hydraulically damped rubber mount of car engine. Li-Rong Wang and Zhen-Hua Lu, Tsinghua Univ.; and Ichiro Hagiwara, Tokyo Institute of Technology. Hydraulically damped rubber engine mounts (HDM) are an effective means of providing sufficient isolation from engine vibra- tion while also providing significant damping to control the rigid body motions of the engine during normal driving conditions. This results in a system which exhibits a high degree of non-linearity in terms of both frequency and amplitude. The numerical simulation of vibration isolation characteristics of HDM is difficult due to the fluid-structure interaction between the main supporting rubber and fluid in chambers, the nonlinear material properties, the large defor- mation of rubber parts, structure contact problems among the inner parts, and the turbulent flow in the inertia track. In this paper, an integrated numerical simulation analysis based on structural FEM and a lumped-parameter model of HDM is carried out. The nonlin- ear influences have been considered, such as nonlinear material property, large deformation of rubber, turbulent flow and the vis- cous resistance of fluid. 2001-01-1454. An investigation of automotive seat fabric sound absorption. Antwan McMullan and Marv Mealman, Johnson Controls Inc. - ASG. To gain a better understanding of the acoustic impact automotive seats have in the passenger compartment of a vehicle, various seat cover materials were tested to determine their acoustic characteris- tics. Normal sound absorption, airflow permeability, mass, thick- ness, and perforation density were the characteristics of interest. The fabrics tested included leather/vinyl, knit fabrics woven and velour, and cloth fabrics with various lamination types. All of the materials were tested using the same polyurethane foam sample, taken from a current production seat, for comparison. The results show that fab- rics with lower airflow resistivity and specific airflow resistance val- ues have greater average absorption coefficients. The vinyl and leather fabrics without perforations have little to no absorption while those with perforations are better but are still generally out- performed by most cloth seat fabrics. 2001-01-1455. Sound absorption performance of membrane covered insulators. Geoffrey Shao and Trevor Billy, BBi Enter- prises Inc. ; and Tony Hughes, Bauer Industries. Molded fiberglass hood insulators (hoodliners) and engine side dash insulators (dashliners) are widely applied in vehicles for noise control. These absorptive components reduce reverberant 'build-up' in the engine compartment and thus cut the noise transmission into the passenger compartment. Due to restrictions of underhood space, the hood and dash insulators normally have limited thickness (under 1 .5 inches), which results in inadequate noise absorption coefficient in mid and low frequencies (100 Hz - 2000 Hz), where the peak of engine compartment noise spectrum exists. It is known that covering the porous absorptive panel (at the noise incident surface) with an impermeable membrane will increase the mid-low frequency absorption coefficient of the panel at the cost of some high frequency absorption coefficient loss. 2001-01-1456. Use of layered media for noise abatement in automotive interiors: A balanced approach. Laura E. Gish and Michael A. Sanderson, Lear Corp. Concepts for dual density materials for usage as absorbers and decouplers are based on well-established layered media principles and have been applied for many years in non-automotive applica- tions. Balancing the mass, air flow resistance, and thickness allows for improved noise attenuation in the low-to-mid frequency range which is of particular interest for automotive NVH management. Using these principles, products were tuned via mass and airflow resistance to reduce noise levels while also significantly reducing mass. Validation in various vehicles confirmed that up to a 55% reduction of a sound package's mass is possible. The considerable weight reductions of dash insulators and carpet systems are possible at the same times as the sound level in the vehicle interior is at least maintained and frequently improved. Product designs utilize non- woven fabrics and vertically and or horizontally lapped fibers to provide excellent fit and finish at low weight in an all-thermoplastic, recyclable product. Here, product development is described, which utilized computer modeling to provide a balance between transmission loss and absorption properties. Test results showing the effects of various properties on sound transmission loss and normal incidence absorp- tion as well as in vehicle performance are given. 2001-01-1457. Using polyester fibers for improving acoustics and saving weight in automotive applications. Thomas T. Block, Owens Corning OEM Solutions Group. With today's push towards quieter and more fuel-efficient vehi- cles, the automotive industry must seek alternative materials for use in applications where the same material technology has been used for many years. Polyester fibers offer an excellent option as a mate- rial alternative to address the needs of this industry now and in the future. Polyester fibers can provide improved acoustics and lighter weight in many of the same applications as traditional decouplers and absorbers such as foam, cotton fiber (shoddy), and fiberglass. When designed properly, the polyester insulator/absorber can be used in underhood applications such as hood absorbers, engine side dash insulators, tunnel insulators, trim panel absorbers, watersh- ields, headliner absorption, underpads, and dash insulators, to name a few. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the superior effec- tiveness of polyester products over traditional insulators. The test results indicated overall improved acoustics and as much as a 30% weight savings, in some tests. Testing was completed by replacing the current production underpad, hood insulator, trim absorption, and dash insulator decoupler with the same thickness and lighter- density polyester fiber to demonstrate that equal or better acoustical performance could be attained at a lighter weight. In some cases an improvement of 2 dB A resulted with a 5-7% Articulation Index improvement. In all cases, the polyester fiber performed the same or better than the current production parts. The advantages of using polyester fibers in today's market are that in the proper application, they are lighter, recyclable, cost com- petitive, and better acoustically than foams, cotton shoddy, and fiberglass. 2001-01-1458. Materials for absorptive silencer systems. Norman T. Huff, Owens Corning Automotive Solutions. A variety of fibrous materials are available for use in absorptive silencer systems. The acoustic performance of these materials is mainly dependent upon the number of fibers per unit volume. How- ever, there is a wide variation in the durability of the materials in environments present inside absorptive silencer systems. This paper discusses the relative chemical and thermal durability of these sys- tems and the mechanisms which limit the use conditions of the materials. A brief discussion of the acoustic performance of some of these materials at different filling densities (number of fibers per unit volume) is also given. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1460. Comparison of preformed acoustic baffles and two-component polyurethane foams for filling body cavities. Kurt Lilley, Eric Seifferlein, and Anita Zalobsky, Sika Corp. A variety of expandable sealants are used to fill vehicle body cavities to impede noise, water, air, and dust from entering (and exit- ing) the passenger compartment. This paper compares three sealant technologies used for filling body cavities. The technologies are rubber-based elastomeric preformed parts; thermoplastic elasto- meric preformed parts, and two-component polyurethane that is foamed-in-place directly in the vehicle body cavity. The following comparisons are made between the three technologies: application 190</page><page sequence="190">2001-01-1460-2001-01-1466 methods and issues, cost, material properties and acoustical performance. 2001-01-1461. New developments on glazings. Marc Rehfeld, Saint Gobain Sekurit. Increase of size and bending of glazings, and general improve- ments concerning NVH, has made of glazings one of the weak points to be treated. No specific acoustic solutions existed. First question was to determine exactly concerning which prob- lems glazings were involved, and then what and how solutions could be found. Main problems were found concerning booming noise, transmission of airborne external noise and aerodynamic noise. To dispose of good specifications concerning products, simulations had to be done and validated: finite elements code for low frequency behavior (booming and airborne), SEA and modal superposition concerning medium and high frequency (aerodynamic and air- borne). This was done for monolithic and laminated glass with their shape, free-free and taking into account boundary conditions: glues, extrusion, encapsulation. The way it has been done is presented: measurements of the characteristics of components (interlayers, glues), use of FEM and FEM-BEM methods from CAD shapes, use of SEA. Validations are also presented. Problems to solve were mostly coupling between windshield eigenmodes and internal modes of the cavity excited by the engine (low frequency), and whistling due to coincidence frequency of glass concerning mostly aerodynamic noise. Solutions are found by using specific interlayer instead of standard PVB within the laminated glass, or by improving boundary conditions by using specific shapes and/or material of the joint, first defined by a specific software. Psychoacoustic criteria are used to optimize the solutions. Shape influence is also studied. Some specific studies concerning both problems are presented. Some glass solutions now exist to reduce NVH problems within cars, and/or to compensate reduction of weight, which is one main topic of car industry. 2001-01-1462. Numerical modeling of the damping effect of fibrous acoustical treatments. Ronald W. Gerdes and Jonathan H. Alexander, 3 M Co.; Bryce K. Gardner, Vibro-Acoustic Sciences; Heng-Yi Lai, United Technologies Research Center ; and J. Stuart Bolton, Purdue Univ. The damping effect that is observed when a fibrous acoustical treatment is applied to a thin metal panel typical of automotive structures has been modeled by using three independent techniques. In the first two methods the fibrous treatment was modeled by using the limp frame formulation proposed by Bolton, et al., while the third method makes use of a general poro-elastic model based on the Biot theory. All three methods have been found to provide con- sistent predictions that are in excellent agreement with one another. An examination of the numerical results shows that the structural damping effect results primarily from the suppression of the near- field acoustical motion within the fibrous treatment, that motion being closely coupled with the vibration of the base panel. The observed damping effect is similar in magnitude to that provided by constrained layer dampers having the same mass per unit area as the fibrous layer. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1463. Effect of viscoelastic patch damping on casing cover dynamics. Jun Y. Kim and Rajendra Singh, Ohio State Univ. Many automotive components and sub-systems require visco- elastic damping treatments to control noise and vibration character- istics. To aid the dynamic design process, new approaches are needed for modeling of partial damping treatments and characteriza- tion of the overall dynamic behavior. The analytical component of the design process is illustrated via the transmission casing cover, along with supporting experiments. First, the vibration response of production casing plates is examined, with and without the con- strained layer treatment. A modified flat plate is employed along with a generic housing that provides the realistic boundary condi- tions for subsequent work. A simplified analytical damping model for constrained viscoelastic layer damping is suggested based on assumed modal functions. Using the analytical model, design guide- lines in terms of optimal patch shapes and locations are suggested. Natural frequency shifts associated with patch damping treatments are predicted and successfully compared with measured data. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1464. A comparison of NVH treatments for vehicle fioorpan applications. Kurt M. Lilley, Michael J. Fasse, and Philip E. Weber, Sika Corp. Under the constraints of improved vehicle refinement, automo- tive OEMs are challenged to improve vehicle noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) characteristics, reduce vehicle weight, and stream- line manufacturing and assembly processes. In support of these objectives, alternate methods of vehicle noise control are being investigated. This paper will address one area where alternate mate- rial strategies are being investigated to meet these requirements. Fioorpan damping treatments are a primary component of the overall vehicle noise package. This paper will investigate three fioorpan damping treatments. Comparisons will be made between asphaltic melt sheets, constrained layer dampers, and spray-on dampers. Performance of these treatments will be measured using laboratory methods and will feature a case study using a Body-In- White (BIW) to demonstrate performance of the different materials. 2001-01-1465. Understanding laboratory versus in-vehicle performance of sprayable and sheet applied damping materials. Gary H. Nakkash and Anthony P. Visintainer, DaimlerChrysler Corp.; and Pranab Saha, Kolano and Saha Engineers, Inc. Liquid spray applied damping materials have potential advan- tages over conventional sheet damping materials in automotive body panel vibration applications. In order to understand the acous- tical impact, a laboratory-based NVH study was conducted to com- pare the damping and stiffness performance characteristics of vari- ous sprayable damping materials versus the production damping treatment. Based on this comparison, a criteria was developed to select potentially viable sprayable damping materials for vehicle testing. In-vehicle tests were also performed and compared to the laboratory findings to understand how well the results correlate. This paper discusses a criteria for selecting sprayable damping materials based on bench-top tests for vehicle applications, and the potential benefits of sprayable materials. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1466. Material damping properties: A comparison of laboratory test methods and the relationship to in-vehicle per- formance. Matthew D. Black, Ford Motor Co.; and Mohan D. Rao, Michigan Technological Univ. This paper presents the damping effectiveness of free-layer damping materials through standard Oberst bar testing, solid plate excitation (RTC3) testing, and prediction through numerical schemes. The main objective is to compare damping results from various industry test methods to performance in an automotive body structure. Existing literature on laboratory and vehicle testing of free-layer viscoelastic damping materials has received significant attention in recent history. This has created considerable confusion regarding the appropriateness of different test methods to measure material properties for damping materials/treatments used in vehi- cles. The ability to use the material properties calculated in these tests in vehicle CAE models has not been extensively examined. Existing literature regarding theory and testing for different industry standard damping measurement techniques is discussed. This discussion is followed by the comparison of damping treat- ments through laboratory testing. Finally, the material properties generated from laboratory results are compared to the material's in- vehicle performance using a computer model from Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 191</page><page sequence="191">2001-01-1467-2001-01-1474 2001-01-1467. Polyurethane foam systems for NVH and improved crashworthiness. Frank V. Billotto and Dan Sophiea, Dow Automotive. Recently, automotive engineers have been looking at rigid poly- urethane foam systems for the advantages their application brings to vehicle design and performance. The benefits range from NVH management achieved through effective body cavity sealing and improved structural dynamics, to enhanced vehicle crashworthiness. These benefits can be realized through application of polyurethane foam systems designed for energy management. These systems offer multifunctional, low-cost solutions to traditional approaches and can be modeled early in the vehicle design stage. In many cases, the overall vehicle mass is reduced as reinforcements are eliminated and/or sheet metal thickness is decreased. Dow Automotive has developed a family of water-blown poly- urethane foams specifically for these applications. Development has focused on foam systems designed for impact optimization, allow- ing OEM's to optimize the body structure content. With adequate optimization the potential result is a mass and cost savings with no compromise in performance. The energy management and energy dissipation foam systems for crashworthiness applications are multi- functional in that they also effectively seal body cavities and improve structural stiffness, thereby providing NVH control as they enhance crash performance. The automotive application of these materials validates their effectiveness in reducing NVH, increasing body structure rigidity and minimizing crash displacement, with the latter significantly reducing energy transfer to the vehicle passenger compartment and the potential for occupant injury. 2001-01-1468. Vibrational power flow of rectangular plates stiffened by beams filled with NOPD. Y. M. Liu , X. Q. Huang , and T. N. Chen , Xi' an Jiaotong Univ. The vibration equation of a stiffened plate is derived and the solutions are obtained by using the Laplace transformation. Input and transmission vibrational power flows of the plate are studied theoretically and experimentally. The studies indicate that Non- Obstructive Particle Damping (NOPD) can restrain the peak values of power flow and its propagation. The effects of different NOPD on the vibrational power flow of structure are discussed. The conclu- sions provide a theoretical basis for structural optimal design and damping optimal allocation. The method of reducing noise and vibration with NOPD can give some guidelines for engineering. 2001-01-1469. Optimal bonding thickness for vehicle stiff- ness. Gina Mansour and Chin Jui Chang , SIKA Corp. It is known that improved vehicle stiffness will improve the ride, handling, and acoustical performance of the vehicle. Structural cav- ity reinforcement foams are used as bonding and reinforcing agents for this purpose although thorough understanding of the application and design parameters of the reinforcing material has not been reached. This paper will help understand the optimums for stiffness of the metal/reinforcing material composite through the use of labo- ratory three-point bending experiment. Various thickness and con- figurations of the metal and material will be included, as well as the rate of deformation. 2001-01-1470. Active path tracking - A rapid method for the identification of structure borne noise paths in vehicle chassis. Alfred Rust and Ingo Edlinger , AWL LIST GmbH. The effective identification and control of powertrain structure- borne harmonic noise is one key for achieving the desired noise pat- tern in a vehicle. Much work is being done in this field to refine and develop transfer path analysis techniques suitable for application at each stage of a vehicle development program. For vehicle application, transfer path analysis and source identi- fication techniques are in use today with varying degrees of success and application complexity. Investigation tools which are fast, do not require extensive vehicle dismantling and yet provide reliable answers, are of great value to NVH and sound quality engineers. A novel Active Path Tracking (APT) method has been developed which is fast to apply and offers immediate practical confirmation of the contributions of all identified chassis transmission paths to the vehicle interior. Powertrain mount input forces are derived and their relative importance is ranked based upon their ability to recreate the vehicle interior sound field under investigation. The method involves the novel adaptation of active noise cancel- lation techniques for identifying all sources and transmission paths as well as for the immediate verification of the results by active vibration cancellation procedures. In this paper the method itself and its application for the interior noise improvement of a passenger car will be demonstrated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1471. A comparison of the newly proposed Gabor order tracking technique vs. other order tracking methods. Michael F. Albright, Roush Industries; and Shie Qian, National Instruments Corp. A new method for extracting order-related signal components from rotating machinery data is proposed. The notion of the Gabor expansion and the Gabor transform for time/frequency analysis are introduced and the relationship between them is described. Gabor Order Tracking (GOT) is offered as one possible masking strategy for extracting desired signal components from the time/frequency domain for reconstruction in the time domain. Practical examples are utilized to illustrate the proposed method in comparison to estab- lished techniques. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1473. Measuring a geometry by photogrammetry: Evaluation of the approach in view of experimental modal anal- ysis on automotive structures. Benoit Dierckx and Christophe De Veuster, LMS International; and Pierre-Alain Guidault, ENS Cachan. The very first step when starting an experimental modal analysis project is the definition of the geometry used for visualization of the resulting mode shapes. This geometry includes measurement points with a label and corresponding coordinates, and usually also con- nections and surfaces to allow a good visualization of the measured mode. This step, even if it sounds straightforward, can be quite time consuming and is often done in a rather approximate way. Photogrammetry is a technique that extracts 2D or 3D informa- tion through the process of analyzing and interpreting photographs. It is widely used for the creation of topographic maps or city maps, and more and more for quick modeling of civil engineering struc- tures or accident reconstruction. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the use of this technique in the context of modal testing of automotive structures. After a short description of the method, the approach will be evaluated with regard to several criteria: accuracy, convenience, cost, required time. Two cases will be shown: the measurement of an exhaust, on which the measurements will be compared with a classical co- ordinate measurement machine and the measurement of a body in white, for which the measured points will be correlated with points of an FE model. The study will show that photogrammetry is indeed an interest- ing approach to measure the geometry. The main benefits are the increased accuracy compared to manual measurements, short immo- bilization time of the object, simplicity, enhanced visualization and low cost. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1474. A virtual car: Prediction of sound and vibra- tion in an interactive simulation environment. Klaus Genuit, HEAD acoustics GmbH; and Wade R. Bray, HEAD acoustics, Inc. Feeling and hearing the results of engineering decisions immedi- ately via a Virtual car' - simultaneous engineering - can signifi- cantly shorten vehicle development time. Sound quality and discrete vibration at the driver's position may be predicted and 'driven' before the first prototype is built. Although sound cannot yet be pre- 192</page><page sequence="192">2001-01-1474-2001-01-1484 dieted in an unknown chassis, the sound and vibration behavior resulting from a new engine, never previously installed in a given vehicle, may be predicted, heard binaurally and felt in an interactive 'drive able' simulation based on transfer path analysis. Such a simu- lation, which includes the binaural sound field and discrete vibration of steering wheel and seat, can also include wind and tire noise to determine if certain engine contributions in sound and vibration may be masked. The method involves use of two technologies in con- junction: binaural transfer path analysis (with vibration transfer path analysis) and a real-time interactive multichannel acoustic and vibration simulation system. From the transfer path data the simula- tion environment permits interactive control from throttle position, etc., of relevant vehicle behavior including load, gear ratios, and vehicle mass, providing a running acoustic and vibration simulation. The user can change chassis impedances and transfer path properties and immediately 'drive' the resulting behavior. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1475. Wavelet-based visualization of impulsive and transient sounds in stationary background noise. David Scholl , Ford Motor Co . Scalograms based on shift-invariant orthonormal wavelet trans- forms can be used to analyze impulsive and transient sounds in the presence of more stationary sound backgrounds, such as wind noise or drivetrain noise. The visual threshold of detection for impulsive features on the scalogram (signal energy content versus time and frequency,) is shown to be similar to the audible threshold of detec- tion of the human auditory system for the corresponding impulsive sounds. Two examples of impulsive sounds in a realistic automotive sound background are presented: automotive interior rattle in a vehi- cle passenger compartment, and spark knock recorded in an engine compartment. 2001-01-1477. Experimental determination of automotive system response characteristics. Jiantie Zhen, Teik C. Lim , and Guangqing Lu, University of Alabama; and James Van Loon, and Joe Juan, Ford Motor Co. Vehicle NVH performance is significantly affected by the dynamics of various primary systems. In the automotive industry, different design activities or vendors are responsible for designing various different systems simultaneously. Therefore, it is highly desirable to gain a better understanding of the individual system characteristics and the interaction between the primary systems to achieve a desirable overall NVH performance. Unfortunately, it is usually quite difficult to construct a proper fixture to accurately measure and quantify the actual uncoupled system characteristics. This paper examines an alternate approach of applying the FRF- based substructuring method to back-calculate the system response characteristics from the full vehicle system measurements. The results are then used to forward-compute the dynamic response of the vehicle, which are also validated by comparison to the direct response function measurements. In this paper, a two-system formu- lation is developed based on the assumption that there is very little cross-axis coupling between the different mounting points of the two distinct systems of interest. The calculated system FRFs can be analyzed to expose critical structural areas and paths that contribute significantly to the interior noise and vibration levels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1478. Reduction of the vibration transmission in a front wiper system. Sandrine Colnet and Arnaud Caracciolo, VALEO Wiper Systems. This paper presents an experimental methodology used to attenu- ate the vibration transmission. It is applied to a front wiper system mounted on a car in order to reduce the noise due to the motor wiper system in the passenger compartment. It gives information on the rubber grommet behavior. 2001-01-1479. Automatic detection of buzz, squeak and rattle events. G. Cerrato-Jay, Tecumseh Products Research Laboratory ; J. Gabiniewicz and J. Gatt, Magna Automotive Testing ; and D. J. Pickering, MTS Systems. In the world of BSR (Buzz, Squeak and Rattle) testing, there is a high level of sophistication regarding the test machines employed to excite the items under test as well as the techniques used to ensure that the test is representative of real-life operating conditions. How- ever, the object of the measurements, i.e., the identification of tran- sient acoustic events classified as Buzz, Squeak or Rattle, is mostly a subjective procedure with classification in terms of Sound Pres- sure Level in dB(A) or Stationary Loudness. These 'standard' met- rics have proven, in general, unreliable in assessing the importance of individual transient events, and inappropriate to describe the vehicle signature from a BSR standpoint. This paper presents a methodology that has been developed for the BSR test of a vehicle using a road simulator to: 1. Demonstrate the feasibility of an auto- mated system of detection of BSR events that can replace the 'sub- jective' detection 2. To establish 'vehicle BSR' indices that can be used to assess design targets and specifications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1481. Chassis dynamometer simulation of tire impact response. C. Q. Liu and Gregory M. Goetchius, Daimler- Chrysler Corp. One of the major NVH concerns for automobile manufacturers is the response of a vehicle to the impact of the tire as it encounters a road discontinuity or bump. This paper describes methods for ana- lyzing the impact response of a vehicle to such events. The test vehi- cle is driven on a dynamometer, on which a bump simulating cleat is mounted. The time histories of the cleat impact response of the vehicle can be classified as a transient and a repeated signal, which should be processed in a special way. This paper describes the related signal processing issues, which include converting the time data into a continous spectrum, determination of the correct scaling factor for the analyzed spectrum, and smoothing out harmonics and fluctuations in the signal. This procedure yields a smooth frequency spectrum with a correctly scaled amplitude, in which the frequency contents can be easily identified. 2001-01-1482. Determination of the noise contributions of engine surfaces. P. J. G. van der Linden and T. Keppens, LMS Engineering Belgium; and J. Raff and J. Schnur, DaimlerChrysler. One of the key elements in efforts to minimize the noise emmis- sion is of engines and other machinery is the knowledge of the main noise radiating surfaces and the relation between measurable surface vibration and the sound pressure. Under the name of Airborne Source Quantification (ASQ), vari- ous techniques have been developed to discretize and quantify the source strength, and noise contributions, of vibrating surface patches of machinery or vehicle components. The noise contribu- tions of patches to the sound pressure at specific locations in the sound field or to the total radiated sound power are identified. The source strength of equivalent point sources, the acoustic transfer from the source surface to critical sound field locations and finally the sound pressure contributions of the individual patches are quan- tified. These techniques are not unique to engine application, but very relevant for engine development. An example is shown for an engine under artificial excitation. 2001-01-1484. Condition monitoring of a gear box using vibration and acoustic emission-based artificial neural network. Issam Abu-Mahfouz, Penn State University at Harrisburg. The objective of this study is to investigate and develop an Artifi- cial Neural Network approach based on vibration and AE signals for the detection, and characterization of wear, damage, and malfunc- tion of an experimental gearbox. Five artificial defects were intro- duced to the gearbox and these are; (1) tooth face wear, (2) full tooth 193</page><page sequence="193">2001-01-1484-2001-01-1491 breakage (missing tooth), (3) clearance or backlash, (5) axial gear looseness, and (5) single internal bearing race wear. The signals, collected from extensive experimentation, were analyzed using time-frequency harmonic wavelet transform, Power Spectral Den- sity (PSD), and four statistical measures of the time domain that cap- tured the salient features of the vibration and AE signals. The results of the time and frequency domain analysis were used in developing a neural network-based estimator for on-line monitoring of gearbox operational condition. The results strongly suggest that vibration and acoustic emission (AE) signals have tremendous promise for machine health monitoring and diagnostics. The proposed technique can be adopted for on-line monitoring of power train and Engine systems, which could be a second phase of this project. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1485. New innovation in sound intensity: Selective intensity. Marc Marro quin, Briiel &amp; Kjaer North America, Inc. Sound Intensity is a well known and industry accepted technique used to identify noise sources and calculate sound power. Since its advent in the late '70s, there haven't been too many truly 'new' innovations in this field. In this paper, a new innovation will be introduced; selective intensity. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1487. Construction of a world-class vehicle acousti- cal laboratory facility. Michael F. Cooper and Carl J. Volk, Jr., Harley Ellis; and Richard A. Kolano, Kolano &amp; Saha Engineers, Inc. The General Motors Corporation Noise and Vibration Analysis Laboratory (NVAL) was conceived in response to General Motors Corporation's need for a state-of-the-art noise, vibration and harsh- ness (NVH) testing and development facility. This paper examines the construction of the NVAL to help illustrate the process of con- verting NVH facility design documents into a functioning facility. It features a summary of items learned through the course of the con- struction effort and outlines issues a technical building owner should consider when embarking on a new facility project. NVH facility construction is unique. The traditional construction approach, emphasizing time and cost reduction, must be buffered with an equal or greater emphasis on performance and the proper sequencing of tasks to allow these integrated facilities to meet their operational objectives. Precise implementation of design intent, proper scheduling with a focus on NVH issues, team coordination and critical issue recognition/resolution are essential for effective management of an NVH facility construction project. This paper discusses the measures a building owner can take to confirm that NVH performance remains the focal point of the proj- ect through the complex construction process. Particular topics addressed include the importance of design team on-site services, construction task sequencing, the general contractor versus con- struction manager approach, team member roles and responsibili- ties, and conflict resolution strategies. Case studies, outlining prob- lems that can occur when NVH performance is not considered dur- ing construction will also be presented. It is the hope of the authors that, upon reading this paper, the reader will have a better understanding of the overall NVH facility construction process. 2001-01-1488. Design of a world-class vehicle acoustical labo- ratory facility. Richard A. Kolano, Kolano &amp; Saha Engineers, Inc. ; and Michael F. Cooper and Alan L. Johnson, HarleyEllis. This paper examines the critical design elements and issues asso- ciated with converting facility goals and business objectives into a functional facility. The design of the General Motors Corporation Noise and Vibration Analysis Laboratory (NVAL) will be discussed to help clarify key points. A team-oriented design approach is essen- tial to meet the stringent safety, flexibility and operational require- ments associated with noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) facili- ties. The first step is establishing the design team and their respec- tive roles in the process. The challenge of 'how to build a facility that meets the specified objectives' is addressed in the programming phase. Operational and financial objectives are reviewed and validated. Upon completion of the programming effort, the team attacks the special technical challenges borne out of that process. This is the beginning of the design development phase of the project and involves tackling such issues as acoustic isolation, vibration isola- tion and HVAC system noise control. The goal is to meet the techni- cal challenges associated with actual facility capabilities and simul- taneous testing of different operations within the building. At the conclusion of these critical elements, the design team is prepared to complete the detailed design of the facility and plan for the ensuing construction. This paper offers a summary of the NVH facility design process, as well as key items learned through the course of the General Motors Corporation NVAL design effort. 2001-01-1489. Novel design of a multi-function acoustics lab- oratory for the testing and evaluation of automotive acoustics systems and components. Peter C. Laux, Jerry R. Veen, Robert J. Unglenieks, and Michael R. Dinsmore, Johnson Controls Interiors, LLC. The acoustic performance requirements of vehicle interior trim elements and sound package elements have increased significantly in recent years. Additionally, the burden of developing these prod- ucts has been shifted from the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to suppliers. To aid in developing lightweight, low-cost, and high-performance parts, a flexible acoustic testing facility was designed for use in many different applications. Specific, purpose- built chambers for only one type of measurement are typically not cost-effective facilities. 2001-01-1490. A method and apparatus for generating full- vehicle roof system rain noise for the purpose of development, benchmarking and interior noise performance measurement. Gerald R. Veen, Marvin R. Mealman, and Phillip J. Eppard, John- son Controls Inc. The direct excitation of a vehicle roof system by a repeatable method and the corresponding interior sound pressure level gener- ated by that excitation can be a key characteristic of the total interior acoustic signature of a vehicle. After nine years of work and five design iterations, a test method and apparatus has been developed that exposes a vehicle to a repeatable and measurable artificial rain excitation. The test apparatus, method and performance data are reviewed. Performance data is shown for several different vehicles and roof systems. 2001-01-1491. Development of a precision variable load transmission error test device. Michael P. Pierz , General Motors Powertrain Group. The need for more accurate determination of gear noise sources for high-speed powertrain gear systems has lead to the development of a new test device. The General Motors Corporation Noise and Vibration Center at Milford Michigan is the first installation of the Rotational Analytics GL3000. The GL3000 has been developed to provide both unloaded and loaded transmission error measurements of both bare gearsets and gear subassemblies. The GL3000 was designed to provide a thermally and load stable structure capable of providing micron level positional accuracy dur- ing test. Linear slides provide the capability to sweep through a range of gear positions while accumulating rotational data from both gear axes with arc second level precision. Simultaneous acquisition of acoustic signatures is provided by the Rotee USA analysis sys- tem. Trials of the GL3000 have shown excellent correlation between the transmission error and acoustic signatures. Transmission error measurement accuracy and repeatability of the GL3000 have proven to be far better than that provided by previous measurement systems. 194</page><page sequence="194">2001-01-1492-2001-01-1501 2001-01-1492. Free field simulation in anechoic chambers. Jonathan Weinstein and Victor Clemente , Industrial Acoustics Co. Anechoic chambers are often commissioned using the 'draw- away' test methods and required results specified by ISO 3745 to determine the degree to which a free field is simulated. A method to understand and predict these results on the basis of room dimen- sions and absorptive characteristics of the room surfaces is described and predictions compared with field measurements. 2001-01-1493. New absorbers and silencers for wind tunnels and acoustic test cells. Peter Brandstätt and Helmut V. Fuchs , Fraunhofer-Institut für Bauphysik; and Manfred Roller , F ai st Anla- genbau GmbH. Low-frequency noise measurements in reverberation and free- field rooms require special attention as the sound field in this fre- quency range may be dominated by only a few modes (eigenfre- quencies). This paper shows how reverberation rooms may be ade- quately damped to smooth the spatial sound field and to increase reproducibility and repeatability without violating the standards. Absorber modules and their operation principle are presented which are only 250 mm thick and are used as lining for test cells and wind tunnels providing free-field conditions down to 50 Hz for 1/3 -octave band measurements. Their high acoustic effectiveness is proved by measurements in well-conditioned test rooms and with measure- ments in realized projects. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1494. Freudenberg-NOK/Vibracoustic Noise, Vibra- tion and Harshness Technical Center. Steven G. Nelson and Rod G. Hadi , Vibracoustic North America ; and Robert T. Edgar , Freu- denberg-NOK. Noise and vibration performance is becoming an important factor for consumers when selecting a new vehicle. To provide the con- sumer with a product that meets their needs, the major automotive manufacturers are looking to their suppliers for noise and vibration solutions. Those suppliers that are able to take the lead in the race for new technologies will be the most successful. Freudenberg-NOK has acknowledged this fact, and formed the Vibracoustic North America division to meet this need. This divi- sion will work to incorporate superior noise and vibration character- istics into our products at the early stages of design. A state-of-the-art technology center was constructed, dedicated to the design and development of cost effective noise and vibration solutions. With the ability to simulate real-world conditions, this new facility will reduce test time, and eliminate much of the inherent variability in road testing.

Allen and Nickolas Vlahopoulos, University of Michigan; and Benjamin J. Saltsman , Ford Motor Co. A numerical methodology based on the finite element and boundary element methods is presented for computing the noise radiated from an elastically supported structure subject to turbulent boundary layer excitation. The new algorithm utilizes the fluctuat- ing wall pressure in order to define the excitation on the structural- acoustic system. The developments target wind noise prediction for the sound radiated by the side glass window of an automobile. The glass-seal assembly is modeled as a flexible plate mounted on an elastic foundation with stiffness and damping characteristics. Numerical predictions are compared successfully to wind tunnel test data. Parametric analyses are performed in order to identify the char- acteristics of the seal that can lead to noise reduction. 2001-01-1497. Development of acoustic holography and its application in Hyundai aeroacoustic wind tunnel. Geon-Seok Kim, Hyoung-Kun Park, Seung-Gyoon Jung, and Kang-Duck Ih, Hyundai Motor Co. Aeroacoustic technology to improve the acoustic comfort in high-speed became a major topic in vehicle development process. Although most of wind noise reduction and sound quality improve- ments are possible with full vehicle, the countermeasures should be applied at the early design stage. Acoustic holography technology was used to identify the external wind noise sources of a vehicle in Hyundai Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel. Microphone self-noise reduc- tion techniques and several reference microphone positions are investigated in order to obtain proper results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1498. Automotive HVAC flow noise prediction mod- els. Niranjan Humbad, Visteon Corp. Flow noise from automotive HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning) systems is one of the major considerations of occupant comfort. The noise generated at high blower speed is a major contributor to the vehicle interior noise. This paper reviews automotive HVAC air rush noise prediction models for estimating register, buck (air handling subsystem) and vehicle noise levels. The vehicle noise prediction method correlates well with measured noise levels at driver right ear location: with a standard deviation of 1.31 dB where standard deviation is the difference between measured and predicted noise levels for a sample size of 10 vehicles. 2001-01-1500. Roll-down process development for transmis- sion garage shift quality. G. Nessier and W. Stokes, MTS Systems Corp.; and R. Beikmann, J. Curtis, and T. Mitchell, General Motors Corp. A roll down methodology has been developed to predict the driv- er' s seat track fore-aft acceleration response using measured half shaft torque time histories and an analytically predicted vehicle sen- sitivity function suitable for transverse front-wheel-drive powertrains. The predicted vehicle sensitivity function (a frequency response function) relates the transmission torque applied to the drive axles to the seat track fore-aft acceleration. An experimental procedure was developed to measure the in-situ vehicle sensitivity function. The experimental data was used to correlate the analytical model. The testing results have shown that in the frequency range of the 'garage shift' that the vehicle body can be represented as a rigid body. A Nastran model utilizing a rigid body representation of the body and powertrain is used to predict the vehicle response to the torque transient. This simplified approach enables powertrain designers at the concept stage of development to predict the seat track fore-aft acceleration using a concept mounting, and 'tune' a design to minimize the vehicle sensitivity to 'garage shift.' The ana- lytical model was correlated to a baseline vehicle, then applied to a powertrain that utilized a different powertrain mounting configura- tion and the updated model was used to predict the resulting seat track fore-aft acceleration. 2001-01-1501. Roll-down considerations in idle quality. Randall S. Beikmann, General Motors Powertrain Group. Idle quality is a complex phenomenon, involving both the aver- age vibration amplitude perceived by the occupants and also its unsteady, erratic shake amplitude (here referred to as lumpiness). Besides the periodic combustion torque produced by an ideal engine, cycle-to-cycle combustion variation causes a random torque component. Together, these torque components cause periodic and random vibration response components. The random component, by its nature, has modulating amplitude. Further, depending on their dominant frequencies and amplitudes, the random and periodic components can modulate with each other. The resulting sudden change in amplitude is often interpreted as an engine 'miss' or par- tial burn, when in fact it may not be. This and other idle phenome- 195</page><page sequence="195">2001-01-1501-2001-01-1507 non are also highly affected by the sensitivity of the vehicle, as determined by the powertrain mounting and body structure. 2001-01-1502. Integrating test and analytical methods for the quantification and identification of manual transmission drive- line clunk. David A. Gilbert , Michael F. OfLeary, and Jeffrey S. Rayce, General Motors Corp. Driveline clunk is a phenomenon that can adversely affect cus- tomer perception of vehicle quality. Clunk is created by the impact of two driveline components as they oscillate in response to a torque disturbance in the driveline system. This disturbance is typically ini- tiated by a driver-controlled engine torque variation, most severely through a throttle or clutch manipulation. This torque variation excites a torsional response from the driveline, manifested by a vari- ety of mechanisms such as resonances of various shafts, housings and axles, clutch oscillations, and gear impacts. Because automotive drivelines are complex systems composed of many rotating compo- nents, difficulty arises in identifying the impacts that cause clunk and evaluating the significant parameters that can positively affect these collisions. This paper will describe the application of analysis and test meth- ods in the investigation of clunk in a rear- wheel-drive, manual trans- mission vehicle. The interaction between analysis and test methods to design appropriate tests to isolate the primary driveline vibration from the noise response of system components and key driveline component features will be discussed. A lumped mass, transient model has been constructed to assist in the identification of the key parameters and root cause for driveline clunk. This model, limited only to the rotational properties of the driveline, analyzed the rota- tional dynamics of internal components of driveline subsystems dur- ing the clunk event. The tests completed during the investigation focused on rotational dynamics during the clunk response and also comprehended the noise response aspects of the phenomenon. Test methods consisting of vehicle acceleration, component shaft speed, and coincident noise measurements used to correlate and overcome model limitations will be discussed. 2001-01-1503. Modeling and correlation of driveshaft whirl dynamics for RWD sport utility vehicles. H. Y. Isaac Du and Jeff Morgan , GM Powertrain; and Jason M. Wong and Richard Salmon , General Motors Corp. High interest is expressed in using analytical models to eliminate costly driveline tests used to determine the stresses produced in the driveshaft and driveline during resonant operating conditions. This paper discusses an analytical model to simulate the driveline- bending integrity, test procedure. Three major subsystems are mod- eled in this analytical approach, namely powertrain, rear axle, and driveshaft. Imbalance masses were added on the driveshaft to induce the whirl motion of the driveshaft. The combination of nonlinear Multi-body System Simulation (MSS) and linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in the time domain was employed for the evaluation of the dynamic interaction between several parts. 2001-01-1504. Errors in the driveline system balancing pro- cess. Rob Higley, DaimlerChrysler; and John Hiatt, Ford Motor Co. Single-plane balancing is a very well-understood process, whereby an imbalance vector is determined and then opposed by a similar vector of equal magnitude but 180° out of phase. This is used in many situations to improve machine performance, vibration, noise, etc. However, there is inherent in this process a sensitivity to errors of measurement and correction, since a large imbalance vec- tor and the equally large correction vector must be of exactly equal magnitude and exactly 180° apart for perfect balance. This paper examines the effect of errors in measurement of the initial imbalance and correction of it on the residual balance of automotive drivelines. In particular, it examines the effects of the errors present in a system whereby a system balance correction is made, on a driveline assem- bly, at discrete points around a given plane (at bolt locations). Errors occur in measurement of vibration, in calculating correction masses and in applying those correction masses. The errors are examined in terms of quantifying their magnitude and effect on the system. The paper concludes there is a practical limit to the balance that can be achieved primarily due to the fact that corrections are applied to a measured imbalance and not the actual imbalance. 2001-01-1505. Gear whine improvements for an automatic transmission through design retargeting and manufacturing variability reduction. R. Krishnaswami, M. DeFore, D. Hilde- brand, J. Metcalf and D. Sell , Ford Motor Co. Gear whine in 1st gear for an automatic transmission that has been in production for nearly thirty years was identified as an NVH issue. Due to advances in vehicle level refinement, and reduction of other masking noises, the automatic transmission gear whine became an issue with the customer. Since the transmission was already in production, the improvements had to be within the bound- aries of manufacturing feasibility with existing equipment to avoid costly and time consuming investment in new machines. The approach used was one of identifying optimum values of existing gear parameters to provide a reduction in passenger compartment noise. The problem was in a light truck application. Objective noise measurements were recorded for 10 transmissions from more than 50 driven in vehicles. The transmissions were disassembled and the gears inspected. Based on statistical analysis of the data, and using a CAE model with input from this measured data, a set of gear dimensions were identified for retargeting. This was not a complete redesign, but rather a fine-tuning of some gear dimensions with no changes to the manufacturing process. Parts made to this new speci- fication showed a significant reduction in gear whine levels. On analyzing the data that was collected for these gear dimen- sions, it was noted that the variability of these dimensions in high volume manufacturing was more than desired for optimum noise performance. Since the design retargeting was in the order of a few microns, there existed the probability there would be noisy gear- boxes in the hands of the customer because of the variability. A sta- tistical study was undertaken in the gear manufacturing line to iden- tify the sources of variability and establish a way to control these critical dimensions in high volume production within the specified target range. The recommendations from this study are currently being implemented in the manufacturing plant. 2001-01-1506. Gear whine reduction for a new automatic transmission. R. Krishnaswami , S. Kaatz , D. Hildebrand, and J. Hiatt, Ford Motor Co.; and P. Phelan, Visteon Automotive Systems. Gear whine in 1st and 2nd gears in a new rear- wheel-drive auto- matic transmission was identified as a potential customer dissatis- fier. Improvements to the vehicle system were implemented, but did not sufficiently reduce the noise. CAE modeling and hardware test- ing were used for gear tooth optimization, transmission system, driveline, and vehicle system studies. The planetary gears were re- designed with increased contact ratio, and significant interior noise reduction was achieved; but some vehicles still had excessive noise due to gear parameter variability from multiple sources. Using a DOE and statistical studies, a set of gear parameter targets were identified within the tolerances of the design, which achieved the program objectives for noise. 2001-01-1507. Estimation of statistical distribution of com- posite manufactured transmission error, a precursor to gear whine, for a helical planetary gear system. Shounak M. Athavale, Ford Research Laboratory ; Ram Krishnaswami, Ford Motor Co.; and Everett Y. Kuo, Ford Research Laboratory. Gear whine is one of the NVH attributes that have become noticeable as performance of other NVH attributes is improved. The predominant root cause of gear whine is transmission error, defined as the deviation of angular position of driven gear/s from the ideal conjugate position/s. Presence of Transmission error can be attri- buted to three major sources: 1) dimensional variability of individ- 196</page><page sequence="196">2001-01-1507-2001-01-1516 uai gears during manufacturing, 2) misalignment during assembly and 3) dynamic tooth deflections during operation. This paper describes a method to estimate statistical distribution of Composite Manufactured Transmission Error (cMTE) for a plan- etary gear system based on measured surface variation of the gear tooth profiles. The statistical distribution of the surface variation is derived from measured left and right profiles for four equally spaced teeth per gear in both lead and involute directions. Along the lead direction average and maximum lead offset between two gage lines is measured along with any crown. For involute direction, the roll angle at the high point is measured as well as the tip and form fall- off. Most of the prior research in MTE estimation is concerned with single mesh point and often ignores the statistical nature of the prob- lem. The cMTE estimation method described in this paper considers multiple mesh points and determines a single composite measure for the whole system. Also, a normal statistical distribution for each individual gear tooth profile is considered. The cMTE estimation is a two-step process. Initially measured data for gears is used to deter- mine the statistical representation of a family of surfaces. Finally, gear meshing is simulated incrementally and the cMTE is computed at each increment. The distribution of the cMTE is then reported as a function of angular rotation from engagement to disengagement of a single tooth. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1509. Comprehensive combustion noise optimiza- tion. Paulo A. G. Zavala, Maxion International Motores SA; Márcio Gonçalves Pinto, Ford Motor Company do Brasil Ltda; Renato Pavanello and Janito Vaqueiro, UNICAMP; Norbert W. Alt, Nor- bert Wiehagen, and Christoph Steffens, FEV Motorentechnik; and Stefan Heuer, RWTH Aachen, VKA. This paper presents a method applied in the development of an optimized transmission rubber mount of a midsize diesel pickup. The focus of this optimization were to improve the vibration insula- tion and consequently improve the NVH (Noise and Vibration Harshness) quality of the vehicle. The paper describes the basic mounting design and manufacturing constrains, the simulation mod- eling basis, inputs required to perform the computational simulation, the experimental method used to extract the center of gravity and rotational inertia of the powertrain and a general mounting tuning strategy. The mounting dynamic simulation results for the optimized version is also presented compared to the original one. In order to quantify the noise and vibration improvements, the internal noise and vibration transmissibility levels were measured and compared in percentile reduction basis to current vehicle levels. Combustion noise plays a considerable role in the acoustic tuning of gasoline and diesel engines. Even though noise levels of modern diesel engines reach extremely low values, they are still higher than those of conventional gasoline engines. On the other hand, new combustion procedures designed to improve fuel consumption lead to elevated combustion noise excitations as in case of today's direct injecting gasoline engines whose vibration excitation and airborne noise emissions are slightly increased during stratified operation. The partly conflicting development goals resulting from this can only be realized by integrating the NVH specialists' expertise into every development step from concept to SOP. Through these inter- disciplinary design efforts, gasoline engines will maintain their favorable acoustic properties while achieving low fuel consumption levels similar to those of diesel engines, whereas one driving ambi- tion behind modern diesel engine design efforts is to create a 'gaso- line engine sound.' 2001-01-1510.

Optimization of vehicle driveline vibrations using genetic algorithm (GA). A. Farshidianfar and M. Ebrahimi, University of Bradford. Low-frequency longitudinal vibrations resulting from driver throttle inputs are a common problem in modern passenger cars. This phenomenon, which is commonly referred to as shuffle or shunt, is due to sudden changes in the engine torque exciting tor- sional oscillations in the driveline. This paper presents a dynamic model of a vehicle driveline for the optimization of low-frequency torsional vibration. The model used is first validated against experimental tests. Parameter sensitiv- ity studies have been carried out using the model to identify the important components affecting shuffle. Three key parameters have been chosen from the parameter study. To optimize these key factors, Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used in this multi-parameter optimization problem. The results obtained from GAs have been compared with the calculus-based optimization techniques. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1514. Numerical modeling of engine noise radiation through the use of acoustic transfer vectors - A case study. François Gérard, Michel Tournour, Naji El Masri, and Luc Cre- mers, LMS International ; and Mario Felice, and Abbas Selmane, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents the numerical modeling of noise radiated by an engine, using the so-called Acoustic Transfer Vectors and Modal Acoustic Transfer Vectors concept. Acoustic Transfer Vectors are input-output relations between the normal structural velocity of the radiating surface and the sound pressure level at a specific field point and can thus be interpreted as an ensemble of Acoustic Transfer Functions from the surface nodes to a single field point or microphone position. The modal counter part establishes the same acoustic transfer expressed in modal coordinates of the radiating structure. The method is used to evaluate the noise radiated during an engine run-up in the frequency domain. The dynamics of the engine is described using a finite element model loaded with a rpm- dependent excitation. The effectiveness of the method in terms of calculation speed, compared with classical boundary element methods, is illustrated. The evaluation of the results, in function of rpm and frequency, shows the potential of the approach during the engine development process. 2001-01-1516. Vibro-acoustic effects of friction in gears: An experimental investigation. Donald R. Houser, Manish Vaishya, and Jim D. Sorenson, Ohio State Univ. Amongst various sources of noise and vibrations in gear mesh- ing, transmission error and sliding friction between the teeth are two major constituents. As the operating conditions are altered, the mag- nitude of these two excitations is affected differently and either of them can become the dominant factor. In this article, an experimen- tal investigation is presented for identifying the friction excitation and to study the influence of tribological parameters on the radiated 197</page><page sequence="197">2001-01-1516-2001-01-1523 sound. Since both friction and transmission error excitations occur at the same fundamental period of one meshing cycle, they result in similar spectral contents in the dynamic response. Hence specific methods like the variation of parameters are designed in order to dis- tinguish between the individual vibrations and noise sources. The two main tribological parameters that are varied are the lubricant and the surface finish characteristics of gear teeth. Additionally, the test matrix included a wide range of meshing conditions such as gear tooth geometry, operating speed and external load torque. The anal- ysis is conducted both in terms of the radiated sound and the dynamic forces transmitted through the bearings of the gearbox housing. Some of the results are evaluated against theoretical mod- els that predict the dynamic response of gears and the housing. A qualitative discussion is presented on strategies for noise prediction from the knowledge of gear geometry, gear dynamic models, prop- erties of sliding surfaces and sound radiating characteristics of gear- box housing. 2001-01-1517. Analysis and experimental study of the mean flow effect on the sound transmission through a cylindrical shell of an automobile muffler. Joon-Hyun Lee and J. Kim , University of Cincinnati; and Vasudeva Kothamasu, ArvinMeritor Industries , Inc. Sound transmission through the sidewall of an automotive muf- fler has been studied theoretically and experimentally. Three wall structures: a single shell, double shell and porous-cored shell con- structions are considered. Transmission losses through the sidewalls were measured using the two microphone method. Experimental results are compared to one another, and to the corresponding theo- retical analysis results, which shows that the mean flow effect is not a significant factor in designing the muffler sidewall. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1518. Sound transmission through cylindrical dou- ble-walled shells sandwiching porous material. Joon-Hyun Lee and J. Kim, University of Cincinnati; and Han- Jun Kim, ArvinMeri- tor Industries, Inc. Sound transmission through a cylindrical double-walled shell lined with an elastic porous material is studied. Love's equation is applied to describe the shell motions coupled with acoustic wave equations. An interesting method is developed to simplify the analy- sis of the wave propagation in the elastic porous material, which reduces the model developed by Bolton et al., based on the Biot's theory to a simple one-dimensional wave propagation model. The results from the simplified model are compared with those from the Bolton's model and measurements. Solutions for the sound trans- mission through the cylindrical double-walled shell lined with an elastic porous material are obtained for various configurations using the simplified method, and compared with measured results. Advan- tages and limitations of the simplified analysis method developed are explained from the perspective of practical applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1519. Development of an air intake system using vibro-acoustics numerical modeling. Ronaldo F. Nunes, Celso F. Nogueira, and Marcos A. Argentino , debis humaitá; and Dieter Hackenbroich, DaimlerChrysler. This paper describes the use of Vibro- Acoustics numerical mod- eling for prediction of an Air Intake System noise level for a com- mercial vehicle. The use of numerical methods to predict vehicle interior noise levels as well as sound radiated from components is gaining acceptance in the automotive industry. The products of most industries can benefit from improved acoustic design. On the other hand, sound emission regulation has become more and more rigor- ous and customers expect quieter products. The aim of this work it is to assess the Vibro-Acoustics behavior of Air Intake System and influence of it in the sound pressure level of the vehicle. Analyses were performed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM), specifically the following analy- ses were done: normal acoustic modes, transfer function with Struc- ture Fluid Interaction (SFI) and without (SFT), acoustic radiation and study of order with verification of frequencies influence of the engine rotation on the evaluation of sound pressure level. The main frequencies that influence Vibro-Acoustics behavior of the air sys- tem were checked. For the commercial vehicle with 5 cylinders engine, a sweeping from 0 to 350 Hz was done, aiming on verifying the influence of the generated sound pressure level with respect to the engine rotating frequency, i.e., 2nd 1/2 order at 175 Hz and 4200 rpm engine peak rotation, and 5th order at 350 Hz. The results have shown that there is a big potential to influence the radiated sound pressure level (at high frequencies) for the areas represented by the intake duct, medium duct and air filter. This is mainly due to the high flexibility of the material used. Overall, the acoustic analyses have shown that an increase in stiffness on this zone can reduce the acoustic energy emitted to the exterior. As a conclusion, the use of the Helmholtz Resonators close to the turbine region have been sug- gested to reduce the sound pressure level in air intake system when sized for specific frequencies, as for example in the range between 50 to 100 Hz, which was verified in the analyses. 2001-01-1520. Assessment of numerical models and methods for noise radiation prediction. A. F. Seybert, University of Ken- tucky ; Jiaohua Shi, Aerotek/Caterpillar, Inc.; and Anil Charan, Aerotek/General Motors Corp. This paper considers two questions: how does one know when a boundary element mesh is reliable, and what are the advantages and potential pitfalls of various methods for sound radiation predic- tion. To answer the first question, a mesh checking method is used. With this method velocity boundary conditions are calculated on the nodes of the mesh using a point source or sources placed inside the mesh. A boundary element program is then used to calculate the sound power due to these boundary conditions. The result is com- pared to the known sound power of the point source or sources. This method has been used to determine the maximum frequency of a mesh, how many CHIEF points to use, etc. The second question is answered by comparing the results of several numerical methods to experimental results for a running diesel engine. The methods exam- ined include the direct and indirect boundary element methods and the Rayleigh integral. 2001-01-1521. Numerical prediction of a whole car vibro- acoustic behavior at low frequencies. Alexis Sol and François Van Herpe, PSA Peugeot Citroen. In order to meet the customers comfort requirements, reduction of noise in the passenger compartment is one of the primary con- cerns in the automotive industry. Moreover, for a better reactivity to the market, vehicle development time tends to be shorter and shorter. Instead of constructing many prototypes and running a lot of tests, numerical simulation has to take a bigger part in the design of cars. This would be a cheaper and quicker way of testing many new solutions. We have developed for several years a numerical model, combining by Finite Element Method (FEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM), for computing the vibro-acoustic behavior of a fully trimmed car with engine and power train. This model allows prediction of the structure borne sound field due to the engine and wheels excitations at low frequencies (0-200 Hz). It is shown how such a model can be achieved: for each compo- nent of the vehicle, we illustrate how to build up validated structural FE model, i.e., models correlated with experiments. Those local models are assembled to construct a FEM for the whole car. The resultant sound pressure level in the cavity is then computed using FEM or BEM codes coupling acoustics and vibrations. 2001-01-1523. Test-based methods for high frequency struc- ture-borne noise. Hamid Mir, DaimlerChrysler. NVH engineers typically are dealing with issues that relate to shake, harshness and low frequency noise and vibration concerns. However there is a greater importance being placed on dealing with 198</page><page sequence="198">2001-01-1523-2001-01-1530 high-frequency structure-borne noise problems which are related to gear meshing forces and drivetrain dynamics. This paper presents a case study of a high frequency structure- borne noise problem. The objective of the paper is to show the appli- cation and effectiveness of using various testing-based techniques such as Transfer Path, Running modes, and Mobility analysis along with acoustic excited operating deflection shapes for solving these problems in a timely and effective manner. 2001-01-1524. An energy source simulation method to pre- dict sound radiation. D. W. Herrin , T. W. Wu, and A. F. Seybert, University of Kentucky. An energy source simulation method (ESSM) has been devel- oped to determine sound energy density. Using this approach, a specified intensity boundary condition on the surface of a vibrating body is approximated by superimposing energy density sources placed inside the body. The unknown strengths for these sources are then found by minimizing the error on the boundary, using a least squares technique. The superposition of these energy density sources should then approximate the sound radiating from the body. The approach was evaluated in two dimensions for a circle, square, and a more general geometry. The ESSM proved an excellent tool for predicting the energy density provided that power radiated uni- formly in all directions. However, the ESSM could not accurately predict the directional characteristics of the energy density field if the power radiated significantly higher from one side of an object than other sides. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1525. Sound through partial enclosures with lou- vers. Ferdy Mārtiņus, Zakir Quabili, and A. F. Seybert, University of Kentucky. This paper considers the use of partial enclosures and absorbing materials inside those enclosures to dissipate energy. Several experi- ments were conducted where various parameters of an enclosure were altered and the effect on the noise radiating through the open- ing was measured. From these results, the parameters that play the most important role in sound radiation through the opening of an enclosure were determined. The two-point method and decomposi- tion theory were used to calculate the transmission loss, which was used as the primary variable to analyze the enclosure's performance; the transmission loss is shown to be a better variable than sound pressure or output sound power for this purpose. Numerical simula- tions were conducted using the indirect boundary element method, and the results were compared with experimental results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1526. Application of an acoustical resonator to reduce HVAC blower noise. Jeffrey J. Case and William A. Cuddy, Ricardo, Inc. Blower noise is the single most dominating contributor of inte- rior noise for several operating conditions; the worst condition being low engine speed and high HVAC fan speed. The goal of the research presented in this paper is to investigate the application of an acoustical resonator to reduce HVAC blower noise. Resonator systems are constructed and objective bench tests are performed to objectively assess their effectiveness towards a specific acoustical issue within the HVAC system. In addition, HVAC performance is objectively measured to ensure that airflow has not been degraded with the addition of the resonator. Modeling and simulation are used in this research to verify the HVAC system acoustical properties and to optimize the location of the resonator. 2001-01-1527. Accounting for manufacturing variability in interior noise computations. Michael J. Allen and Nicholas Vlahopoulos, University of Michigan. A formulation that accounts for manufacturing variability in the analysis of structural/acoustic systems is presented. The methodol- ogy incorporates the concept of fast probability integration with finite element (FEA) and boundary element analysis (BEA) for pro- ducing the probabilistic acoustic response of a structural/acoustic system. The advanced mean value method is used for integrating the system probability density function. FEA and BEA are combined for producing the acoustic response that constitutes the performance function. The probabilistic acoustic response is calculated in terms of a cumulative distribution function. The new methodology is used to illustrate the difference between the results from a probabilistic analysis that accounts for manufacturing uncertainty, and an equiva- lent deterministic simulation through applications. The probabilistic computations are validated by comparison to Monte Carlo simula- tions. Significant computational timesavings are achieved by the new probabilistic algorithm in comparison with the Monte Carlo Simulations. Based on its computational efficiency and its accuracy the new methodology is concluded to be a viable method of calculat- ing numerically the probabilistic response of structural/acoustic sys- tems due to manufacturing variability. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-1528. Tire and car contribution and interaction to low-frequency interior noise. Michel Constant and Jan Leyssens, Goodyear Technical Center Luxembourg; and Filip Penne and Ray- mond F rey mann, BMW AG. A joint study was conducted between BMW and Goodyear with the objective of analyzing the cause and identifying methods to reduce the structure-borne interior noise in a vehicle driving on rough road surfaces. A vibro-acoustic characterization of the car was performed by measuring the car vibro-acoustic transfer functions and by using a transfer path analysis technique to identify the main suspension parts affecting the interior noise at target frequencies. The vibration transmis sibility characteristics of the tire were measured and also simulated by Finite Element in [1-200 Hz] frequency range. The vibro-acoustic interaction between the tire and car sub-systems was examined. A Finite Element sensitivity analysis was used to define and build new prototype tires. A 3 dB(A) interior noise improvement was obtained with these new tires at target frequencies. 2001-01-1529. 'Digital Prototype' simulations to achieve vehicle level NVH targets in the presence of uncertainties. S. D. Gogate, Altair Engineering, Inc.; and A. E. Duncan, Automotive Analytics, Inc. 'Digital Prototype' simulations have been used at DaimlerChrys- ler to achieve vehicle level NVH objectives. The effectiveness of these simulations to guide the design when faced with vehicle parameter uncertainties is discussed. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, material properties, material gauges, damping, structural geometry, loads, boundary conditions and weld integrity. Manufacturing and assembly processes introduce variations in the nominal values of these parameters resulting in a scatter of vehicle level NVH simulation responses. An example of a high-frequency NVH concern will be studied and modified to arrive at robust design guidance when faced with uncertainty. The validity of a 'determinis- tic digital prototype' simulation model and its relevant role as a 'trend predictor' rather than 'absolute predictor' tool in guiding the design is also discussed. 2001-01-1530. The influence of in-vehicle noise on speech rec- ognition for automotive voice-activated control systems. Dave G. Fish, MIRA. Voice activation provides a safe and convenient method of con- trolling vehicle systems such as in-car entertainment, telecommuni- cations, and climate control. In the fullness of time it is likely that there will be a high demand across all vehicle classes for such sys- tems for a wide range of vehicle control functions. One of the chal- lenges facing their development and introduction into vehicles is that of the in-vehicle noise environment. This paper investigates the influence of in-vehicle noise on speech recognition performance for 199</page><page sequence="199">2001-01-1530-2001-01-1539 an automotive voice-activated system over a range of vehicle classes and typical vehicle operating conditions.

Analysis of the experimen- tal data showed significant system performance sensitivity and well defined, consistent, performance thresholds to the overall level of noise and spectral balance components typically found in the auto- motive environment. Significant differences in speech recognition performance between the male and female voice were also found. With this information it has been possible to identify both the vehi- cle classes and operating conditions that are likely to create the most challenging environments for acceptable speech recognition perfor- mance. This provides a useful reference for further research and development of both voice-activated speech recognition (VSR) sys- tem software and hardware design, and identification of in-vehicle noise targets for future vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1531. Noise control for heavy-duty trucks, a systems approach. Manuel Sánchez Castillo , E-A-R Specialty Composites. This paper describes a general noise control system design pro- cess. The methodology is applied to heavy-duty trucks. The paper describes the benefits, for optimization purposes, of a systems approach versus a component approach. The role of both experi- mental and predictive approaches on the design process is outlined. Available noise control materials are briefly described, and lastly, an example of the results of the development of a noise control sys- tem by the experimental systems approach is provided. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-1532. Noise sensitivity analysis of an engine mount system using the transfer function synthesis method. Doo-Ho Lee , Dongeui Univ.; Woo-Seok Hwang , Taegu Univ.; and Chan- Mook Kim, Kookmin Univ. The transfer function synthesis method is one of the most power- ful methods in analyzing the responses of complex built-up struc- tures under high modal density. Its superiority mostly comes from the ability to incorporate experimental FRFs into the formulation. In this paper, a general procedure for the design sensitivity analysis of vibro-acoustic problems has been presented in frame of the trans- fer function synthesis method. For an acoustic response function, the proposed method gives a parametric design sensitivity expression in terms of the partial derivatives of the connection element proper- ties and the transfer functions of the substructures. As a realistic problem, an interior noise problem in a passenger car is analyzed. The proposed noise sensitivity formulation calculates the interior noise variations with respect to the changes of the dynamic charac- teristics of the engine mounts and the bushes. To obtain the FRFs, a finite element model is built for the engine mount structures, and experimental FRFs are used for the trimmed body including cabin cavity. The comparison of interior noise sensitivities obtained by the proposed method and the finite difference method shows that the proposed method is efficient and accurate. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1533. Feasibility of using acoustic room models and measured sound power to estimate vehicle interior noise. L. E. Schroeder, International Truck and Engine Corp. In this paper, interior noise of a heavy commercial truck was modeled with the room equation. This approach assumed that large truck cabins may be adequately modeled as a practical room as is done in architectural acoustics, where ray theory and statistical con- cepts are suitable, and where application of complicated wave the- ory may not be necessary. This simplifies computational require- ments, making a semi-empirical scheme useful for timely product development. This study employed sound power measurements at thirty-four surface patches encompassing the interior cabin bound- ary. Each surface-patch constituted an individual interior noise source. Predicted and measured results correlated well, demonstrat- ing the capability to estimate driver-position noise level from pre- dicted periphery sound intensity changes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1535. Laminate dash Ford Taurus noise and vibra- tion performance. Barry Yang and Steven W. Nunez, Ford Motor Co.; and Thomas E. Welch and James R. Schwaegler, MSC Lami- nate and Composites Inc. Mastic material, constrained or non-constrained with doublers, is the traditional method in adding vibrational damping to a steel structure with the goal of reducing panel vibration and radiated sound. With the use of laminated vibration damped steel (LVDS), Ford has been able to reduce the dash panel vibration and optimize sound package design for powertrain noise attenuation. These NVH benefits are presented as the result of a study completed with a lami- nated dash on a Ford Taurus. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1536. Validation and improvement of body panels FE models from 3D-shape and vibration measurements by opti- cal methods. Virginie Linei, Arnaud Lepage, Alexis Sol, and Xavier Bohineust, PSA Peugeot Citroën. In this paper, we propose a strategy for validation and improve- ment of structural finite elements (FE) models using vibration and 3D-shape optical measuring method. The main advantage of these methods is to provide a whole field information allowing to speed-up the measurements, combined with an high spatial resolu- tion ensuring updating quality. This strategy is especially adapted to the improvement of lightweight body panel structures. Several application examples are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1538. Development procedure for interior noise per- formance by virtual vehicle refinement, combining experimen- tal and numerical component models. Tatsuhide Sakai, Masahiro Terada, Shuichi Ono, and Naoki Kamimura, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Ludo Gielen, and Peter Mas, LMS International N. V. This paper summarizes the development of a predictive vibro- acoustic full-vehicle model of a mid-size sedan and focuses on the engineering analysis procedures used to evaluate the design perfor- mance related to engine-induced noise and vibration. The vehicle model is build up from a mixture of test-based and finite element component models. FRF-Based Substructuring is used for their assembly. The virtual car model is loaded by engine forces resulting from indirect force identification. This force-set includes combus- tion, inertia, piston slap and crank bearing forces, for engine har- monics from 0.5 to 10th order. Such forced response analysis yields vibration levels at every component, at every interface between components, and interior noise predictions. The target is to provide the vehicle NVH manager with the insight required to identify major causes for peak noise levels and to set targets and develop an action plan for every component design team. Having such information at any design stage effectively reduces both the design cycle duration and the number of physical prototypes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1539. Interior noise simulation for improved vehicle sound. Norbert W. Alt, Norbert Wiehagen, and Michael W. Schlitzer, FEV Motorentechnik. In the recent past, interior noise quality has developed into a decisive aspect for the evaluation of overall vehicle quality. At most operating points, the dominating interior noise share is generated by the powertrain. Interior noise simulation is a new tool for upgrading interior noise. Based on measurements of air- and structure-borne noise excitations caused by the powertrain, the interior noise shares are determined by applying the properties of the transfer paths. By superimposing the individual interior noise shares, the overall inte- rior noise can be predicted. 200</page><page sequence="200">2001-01-1539-2001-01-1546 Well before the engine is operated in the vehicle for the first time, annoying interior noise shares, their causes and their transfer paths can be identified by subjective and objective analysis. This enables the engineer to focus on vital optimization measures as to excitations occurring at the engine as well as to transfer paths in the vehicle. This paper describes how interior noise simulation can be imple- mented to improve vehicle acoustics. Aside from the identification of excitations of the pre-optimized engine, procedures for the deter- mination of well-shaped air- and structure-borne noise transfer func- tions are described. The interior noise simulation results are compared with the real interior noise and serve as a base for the evaluation of acoustic weak points of the engine and transfer behavior of the vehicle. For noise shares which impair interior noise quality, the dominating transfer path and the extent to which excitation and/or transfer path contrib- ute to the problem are identified. For a component optimization con- ducted at the powertrain test bench, the influences on interior noise are shown by means of simulation. Finally, future development trends for simulation and calculation of interior noise are discussed. 2001-01-1540. Sound quality equivalent modeling for virtual car sound synthesis. Marleen Adams and Patrick van de Ponseele , LMS International. The pressure on development cycles in the automotive industry forces the acoustical engineers to create awareness of sound quality in the early stages of development, perhaps even before a physical prototype is available. Currently, designers have few tools to help them listen to their 'virtual' models. For the design of a synthesis platform of in-vehicle binaural sound, the sound should be modeled with almost identical sound quality perception. A concept is presented where the total sound of a vehicle is split in a number of components, each with its own sound characteristics. These characteristics are described in a signal model that allows the analysis of an existing sound into a limited number of signal components: orders-frequency spectra, time enve- lopes and time recordings. The introduction of this sound synthesis concept in a hybrid model consisting of networks of transfer paths, force inputs and noise sources will allow the evaluation of the impact of changes to structural components on the sound quality of in-vehicle sound. This publication will report on the experience gained and the progress made in these fields. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1541. Development of quiet sound package treat- ments for Class 8 trucks. Charles T. Moritz , Blachford, Inc.; and Jeff A. Kleckner and Pranab Saha , Kolano and Saha Engineers, Inc. This paper focuses on the development of treatments to control airborne noise through the dash panel. For a noise control material supplier, these treatments can be the most challenging to design because of the number of pass-throughs and design constraints. The dash panel development process includes extensive in-truck testing and analysis to identify sound paths (location and magnitude) and establish design criteria, laboratory material testing to aid in the selection of appropriate materials, laboratory component testing to select areas requiring treatment and to design the shape of the treat- ments, and in-truck testing to verify the performance of the new treatments. 2001-01-1542. Pump noise reduction using Shainin statistical engineering methods. Jamie Standring, DaimlerChrysler Corp.; and Prasad Malisetty, Technical Engineering Consultants Inc. Historically, pump noise can be a contributor to customer dissat- isfaction with automatic transmissions. In this paper, a Shainin experiment was conducted to identify all probable root causes for pump noise on a production RWD transmission. Sample transmis- sions were selected following subjective evaluations. Noise was objectively measured in the lab using a microphone and an acceler- ometer. The study was conducted following a systematic Shainin statistical engineering methodology, which included the following major steps: selection of the test measure using the isoplot tech- nique, selection of Best of Best (BOB) and Worst of Worst (WOW) transmissions, assessment of assembly variation, component search, and pair-wise comparisons. The study successfully highlighted the key variables on the drive gear involute profile, which are now being tightly controlled for improved noise characteristics. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1543. NVH testing of hybrid electric powertrains. Bridget Volinski, Ford Motor Co. The purpose of this paper is to further the understanding of NVH test techniques for hybrid electric powertrains. It addresses dyna- mometer testing specifically. Due to the nature of the hybrid electric function, which includes situations when the engine is not running as well as different ratios of torque for power component combina- tions, typical testing methods are not adequate. Hybrid electric test- ing requires unique test conditions, dyno control, instrumentation and analysis. This paper attempts to establish some test standards directed specifically to the data needs of hybrid electric powertrains. 2001-01-1544. Analytical and experimental techniques in solving the plastic intake manifold NVH. Saeed Siavoshani, Mark Stickler, and Hassan Nehme, Ford Motor Co.; and Brian Krajewski, Dow Automotive. The intent of this paper is to summarize the work of the V8 powerplant intake-manifold-radiated noise study. In a particular V8 engine application, customer satisfaction feedback provided obser- vations of existing unpleasant noise at the driver's ear. A compre- hensive analysis of customer data indicated that a range from 500 to 800 Hz suggests a potential improvement in noise reduction at the driver's ear. In this study, the noise source was determined using various accelerometers located throughout the valley of the engine and intake manifold. The overall surface velocity of the engine valley was ranked with respect to the overall surface velocity of the intake manifold. An intensity mapping technique was also used to deter- mine the major component noise contribution. In order to validate the experimental findings, a series of analysis was also conducted. The analysis model included not only the plastic intake manifold, but also the whole powertrain. Finally by using alternative components, an optimum package was developed that combines weight and cost while enhancing the NVH performance of the plastic intake manifold. 2001-01-1545. Wavelet transform applied to combustion noise analysis in high-speed DI diesel engines. José M. Desantes, Antonio J. Torregrosa, and Alberto Broatch, Universidad Politéc- nica de Valencia. Traditionally, combustion noise in diesel engines has been quan- tified by means of a global noise level determined in many cases through the estimation of the attenuation curve of the block using the traditional discrete Fourier transform technique. In this work, the wavelet transform is used to establish a more reliable correlation between in-cylinder pressure (sources) and noise (effect) during the combustion of a new-generation 2-liter DI Diesel engine. Then, in a qualitative sense, the contribution of each source intrinsic to the combustion process is determined for four engine operating condi- tions and two injection laws. The results have shown high variations in both the in-cylinder pressure and noise power harmonics along the time, which indicates the non- stationary character of this process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1546. Squeak studies on material pair compatibility. Ping Lee, Benny Rediers, and Kevin Hunt, Defiance Testing and Engineering Services ; and Robert Brines, General Motors Corp. 201</page><page sequence="201">2001-01-1546-2001-01-1553 The more noise and vibration improvements are incorporated into our vehicles, the more customers notice squeaks and rattles (S&amp;R). Customers increasingly perceive S&amp;R as a direct indicator of vehicle build quality and durability. The high profile nature of S&amp;R has the automotive industry striving to develop the understand- ing and technology of how to improve the S&amp;R performance in the vehicle. Squeaks and itches make up a significant amount of Squeak and Rattle complaints found in today's vehicles. Squeaks and itches are the result of stick slip behavior between two interacting surfaces. Squeak itch behavior is dependent upon a large number of parame- ters including but not limited to: the material itself, temperature, humidity, normal load, system compliance, part geometry, velocity, surface roughness, wear, contaminants, etc. This paper will describe the analysis of sound data and friction data and the relationship between them. 2001-01-1547. Towards a standard for material friction pair testing to reduce automotive squeaks. Kevin Hunt and Benny Rediers, Defiance Testing and Engineering Services , Inc.; Robert Brines , General Motors Corporation , Milford; and Richard McCor- mick, Ted Leist , and Tom Artale, MB Dynamics, Inc. Today vehicle owners perceive squeaks and itches inside a vehi- cle cabin as a major negative indicator of vehicle build quality and durability. Manufacturers struggle to bear the high costs of squeak and rattle (S&amp;R)-related warranty. Although the benefits of struc- tural integrity and tight manufacturing tolerances with respect to the prevention of S&amp;R are known, today's cost, weight, crash require- ments, aesthetic demands and environmental/fire hazard rules quite often dictate the design of S&amp;R prone sub-systems. Even sub- systems with the best possible structural design and manufacturing tolerances are not immune to extreme environmental conditions, and mating materials can initiate contact leading to S&amp;R. One method of minimizing the possibility of squeaks is by the judicious selection of mating material pairs. This paper describes a test process aimed at the quantification of material pair compatibility. Also described is a state-of-the-art, flex- ure-based (virtually frictionless) test instrument that has been devel- oped for such material pair compatibility studies. A group of 17 material pairs with known historical problems were identified by experienced automotive designers and were put through 374 tests encompassing several realistic temperature and humidity extremes in a complex test matrix. Material pair samples were 'rubbed together' in an accurately controlled manner. The types of relative displacement that were used were single excursion pull and realistic road inputs in the form of a shaped random profile. The material pairs included combinations of PVC, ABS, TPO, PP and painted metal from sub-systems such as instrument panels, center consoles, body panels, door trim and weather-strips. Instationary Zwicker loudness was used as a metric for quantifying the squeak in addition to classical friction parameters. From the test data, a classification of the material pairs was made pertaining to their propensity to gen- erate squeak and itch (S&amp;I). Initial levels of correlation with GM material experts' classifications of the same pairs are promising and are the motivation for further studies. The Team (Defiance, General Motors Corporation and MB Dynamics) feels strongly about the need for a comprehensive mate- rials database that is the result of a uniform experimental procedure to identify pertinent material characteristics in order to understand, verify and significantly reduce stick-slip in automotive applications. The Team feels that the test equipment, test procedures and analysis methods that were developed during this project and that are described in this paper, greatly contribute towards this cause. The Team wants to extend the invitation to other interested parties (tri- bology researchers, scientists, automotive or other engineers), to bundle efforts, share best practices and lessons learned, and work towards a standard for material friction pair testing. 2001-01-1550. Frictional and acoustic behavior of automotive interior polymeric material pairs under environmental condi- tions. Martin A. Trapp and Paul McNulty , Ford Motor Co.; and Jack Chu, Medtronic Inc. As automotive manufacturers continue to increase their use of thermoplastics for interior and exterior components, there is a likeli- hood of squeaks due to material contacts. To address this issue, Ford's Body Chassis NVH Squeak and Rattle Prevention Engineer- ing Department has developed a tester that can measure friction, and any accompanying audible sound, as a function of sliding velocity, normal load, surface roughness, and environmental factors. The Ford team has been using the tester to address manufacturing plant issues and to develop a database of polymeric material pairings that will be used as a guide for current and future designs to eliminate potential noise concerns. Based upon the database, along with a physical property analysis of the various plastic (viscoelastic) mate- rials used in the interior, we are in the process of developing an ana- lytical model which will be a tool to predict frictional behavior. The model will be integrated into the automotive component design pro- cess (CAD/CAM/CAE) so that potential concerns can be addressed prior to critical design milestone freeze dates. This paper will review our research results to date. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1551. Rattle noise prediction of a seat belt sensor using numerical methods. Ivanna Malinow, Samuel McDonald, and Ravi Guttal, TRW Occupant Safety Systems. This paper describes the use of numerical methods in the rattle noise prediction of a seat belt sensor mechanism, requiring the solu- tion of transient and highly non-linear acoustic radiation parameters. Hence, the computational model involves flexible body dynamics and boundary element acoustic codes. The predicted sensor motion and the acoustic response have been correlated with experimental results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1552. Excitation and measurement of BSR in vehicle seats. M. Jay, Y. Gu, and J. Liu, Lear Technologies L.L.C. Buzz, Squeak, and Rattle (BSR) tests are commonly employed in the automotive industry as a diagnostic. The resulting signals are typically analyzed using established (historical) metrics such as A-weighted SPL or stationary loudness (IS0532B). However, due to the non-stationary nature of these signals, traditional metrics often fail to fully describe the signals in question. Compounding the issue is the fact that some specifications state that the test specimen is to produce 'no objectionable noises' when subjected to represen- tative excitation. This is a very vague and debatable statement that normally cannot be settled by subjective observations alone. Within this paper, sound quality and statistical metrics are employed for several BSR signals acquired during forced response testing of a seat. Results are presented for two different boundary conditions and alternative signal processing tools are presented. Signal process- ing of non-stationary signals for an unoccupied and biofidelic man- nequin-loaded seat are presented and compared. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1553. Dynamic interactions between loaded and unloaded gear pairs under rattle conditions. T. C. Kim and R. Singh, Ohio State Univ. In many manual transmissions, conditions for the onset of vibro- impacts from an unloaded gear pair are more likely than from an engaged set. Although some of the general characteristics of neutral gear rattle are known, no specific analytical models are available in the literature that can explain interactions between unloaded and loaded gear pairs in the drive rattle mode. For the sake of illustra- tion, a particular problem for a light-duty truck is studied in this paper and dynamic interactions are investigated. Some experimental measurements are first presented to define the unloaded gear rattle problem. Linear and non-linear mathematical models of the drive- line are developed to understand, quantify and control the rattle 202</page><page sequence="202">2001-01-1553-2001-01-1560 problem.

The application of direct body excitation toward developing a full vehicle objective squeak and rattle met- ric. Robert S. Brines and Lesley G. Weiss , General Motors Corp.; and Edward L. Peterson , MB Dynamics , Inc. In order to engineer Squeak &amp; Rattle (S&amp;R)-free vehicles it is essential to develop an objective measurement method to compare and correlate with customer satisfaction and subjective S&amp;R assess- ments. Three methods for exciting S&amp;Rs in the interiors of full vehi- cles were evaluated and sound metrics compared to subjective assessments to select the most promising excitation method. The excitation technology must be representative, controllable, realistic, and contain random- type surfaces. Excitation methods evaluated were road tests over S&amp;R surfaces, road simulators, and direct body excitation (DBE). The principle of DBE involves using electromag- netic shakers to induce controlled, road-measured vibration into the body, bypassing the tire patch and suspension. DBE is a promising technology for making objective measurements because it is extremely quiet (test equipment noise does not mask S&amp;Rs), while meeting other project goals. While DBE is limited in exposing S&amp;Rs caused by body twist and suspension noises, advantages include higher frequency energy owing to electro-dynamic shakers, continuous random excitation, lower capital cost, mobility, and safety. Results show that almost all S&amp;R issues found on the road and simulator are found on DBE. In many cases additional issues are discovered because of the lack of background noise. Initial data tends to show that using DBE to excite interior S&amp;Rs is preferable to actual roads or to 4-post road simulators for making objective measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1555. New developments in molded polyurethane for sound insulation applications. Kevin A. Buck, Huntsman Polyure- thanes. The continual trend towards weight reduction resulted in the implementation of molded polyurethane carpet underlay at a density of 43 kg/m3 in early 2000. Now, through new formulation develop- ments, coupled with the production introduction of carbon dioxide co-blown technology, additional weight reductions have been achieved. This has resulted in molded densities of 34 kg/m3 to be reached in prototype moldings. In addition to weight reductions, there has also been a renewed focus on improving the acoustical per- formance of the sound insulation material. As a result, a new family of formulations has been developed which have shown acoustical improvement while not sacrificing weight. This paper will showcase these new developments and highlight the benefits of polyurethane in sound insulation applications. 2001-01-1556. Novel acoustical polyolefin foams. Chung P. Park, Sandrine Burgun, and Michel Brucker, Dow Deutschland OHG; and Suresh Subramonian, Dow Chemical Co. Novel acoustical materials have been developed. The materials are thermoplastic foams extruded from blends of a polypropylene (PP) resin with an ethylenic polymer resin. One material is an open- cell sheet product made from a blend of a PP resin and a polyolefin elastomer (POE). Another is a large-celled plank foam of substan- tially closed-cell structure made from a blend of a polypropylene resin and a low density polyethylene (PE) resin. The foam materials are of lightweight, hydrophobic, dust free, recyclable and withstand the temperatures prevailing in automotive uses. 2001-01-1557. Pilot benchmarking study of polyether foams for acoustical applications. Manuel Sanchez Castillo, E-A-R Spe- cialty Composites. This paper describes a pilot benchmarking study of polyether foams for acoustical applications. The study investigates the differ- ences in sound absorption performance that result from two different foam manufacturing methods: thin sheet casting and bun manufac- turing. A basic conjecture that is examined in this work is that thin sheet cast foams have the following advantages over bun stock man- ufacturing: higher sound absorption performance and lower vari- ability of the physical properties that determine acoustical perfor- mance. It is shown that the sound absorption performance of thin sheet cast urethane foam is 40% and 67% higher than the best per- formance of bun stock foam when evaluated by the Average Normal Sound Absorption Coefficient (ANSAC) and the noise reduction coefficient (NRC) respectively. In general, the computed variabili- ties for the properties of thin sheet cast urethane foam are lower than those for the bun stock foams. In addition, an analysis of variance (ANOVA), suggests that bun stock foam has properties that vary with statistical significance according to the location along the rise direction. This non- uniformity can be found on the noise reduction coefficient, average normal sound absorption coefficient, and density. 2001-01-1558. Frame resonance of high air flow resistivity plastic foams: Properties to improve acoustical absorption of composite multi-layered systems. Roland Woodcock and Gordon Ebbitt, Lear Corp. The optimization of acoustical properties of multi-layered mate- rials used in the automotive industry requires a good understanding and characterization of the various component layers. This is a par- ticular concern in the case of headliners where performance must be balanced with packing space demands. These composite struc- tures when used with flexible urethane foams provide good stiffness and light weight, but their acoustic performance can be sub-optimal. Measurements undertaken with poro-elastic high airflow resistivity foams highlighted frame resonances which, if exploited, might sig- nificantly improve the acoustical performance of this system. A new modeling technique based on a pseudo-macroscopic description of the poro-elastic material in the framework of a four- pole network will be used to explain these frame resonances. This formulation exploits the electro-acoustical analogy in transmission line theory. The description of the poro-elastic material is based on a global description of the structure superposed on the fluid. Under normal incidence, each phase is assumed to support a compressional wave. In the present study, emphasis will be put on tools to tune these systems to a specific range of frequency and comparison of predictions and measurements will be presented to assess the valid- ity of the modeling technique. 2001-01-1559. Dynamic characterization of foam materials and its application to modeling of automotive seat-passenger system. Chang-Kook Chae, Suyon Song, and Kwang-Joon Kim, KAIST; and Han-Kee Jang, Seung-Han Kim, and Young-Ho Cho, Institute for Advanced Engineering. Dynamic properties of flexible polyurethane foam materials for car seats are highly complicated. In this paper, characterizations of dynamic stiffness of several foam specimens based on static stiff- ness obtained from IFD (Indentation Force Deflection) curve mea- surements are presented. It is observed that dynamic stiffness and its drift with static loading duration in logarithmic scale are propor- tional to the static stiffness at a given static loading regardless of types and dimensions of the foam. A three-degree-of-freedom model of seated human body based on apparent mass measurements together with the characteristics of foam materials were incorpo- rated for transmissibility prediction of the passenger- seat system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1560. Effect of seating foam on the acoustic behavior of an earthmoving cab. K. L. Hong, S. Sureshkumar, and S. T. Rav- eendra, Collins &amp; Aikman Corp. 203</page><page sequence="203">2001-01-1560-2001-01-1567 The designs of vehicle seats have significant impact on interior acoustic modes as well as sound pressure level inside the vehicles. Seats trimmed with elastic porous materials are especially critical to the acoustic behavior of the vehicles due to the sound absorption of the materials. This paper demonstrates how seating materials affect the acoustic performance of an earthmoving cab. To accu- rately simulate the sound absorption of the seat, the seat was mod- eled as a bulk reactive absorber instead of a local reactive absorber. 2001-01-1561. Development and validation of a computa- tional process for pass-by noise simulation. Zhidong Zhang and Nickolas Vlahopoulos, University of Michigan; Thomas Allen , Kevin Zhang , and Xianli Huang , Ford Motor Co.; and David J. Moenssen, Honeywell. The Indirect Boundary Element Analysis is employed for devel- oping a computational pass-by noise simulation capability. An inverse analysis algorithm is developed in order to generate the defi- nition of the main noise sources in the numerical model. The indi- vidual source models are combined for developing a system model for pass-by noise simulation. The developed numerical techniques are validated through comparison between numerical results and test data for component level and system level analyses. Specifically, the source definition capability is validated by comparing the actual and the computationally reconstructed acoustic field for an engine intake manifold. The overall pass-by noise simulation capability is vali- dated by computing the maximum overall sound pressure level for a vehicle under two separate driving conditions. 2001-01-1562. Drive-by noise prediction by vehicle system analysis. A. V. Phillips, Ford Motor Co., Ltd.; and M. Orchard, Direct Design Consultants Ltd. To meet legal requirements vehicle manufacturers have to use a standard drive-by noise acceleration test conforming to relatively easily specified procedures (gear, approach speed, etc). However, due to the transient conditions occurring during the test, predicting maximum drive-by noise levels from the contributions of vehicle systems is difficult. As manufacturers need to identify early in the design of a vehicle those available systems which will ensure legal requirements are met, a technique is required that can predict the contribution of each system. The technique has to be able to accept system target &amp; CAE data as well as test data in order that it can be used in all stages of a vehicle program. 2001-01-1563. Prediction of vehicle pass-by noise using indoor measurements. Bong-Ki Kim, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials; and Sungwoo Yoo, Hanjun Kim, and Kurt Zwanzig , ArvinMeritor Exhaust Systems. Analysis of the contribution of each pass-by noise source to the overall pass-by noise is an important issue for reduction of pass-by noise. A technical approach for analyzing pass-by noise is used to identify the principal noise sources of the pass-by noise in this study. Wave propagation theory and decoupling tests are employed and the near-field measurements are carried out to obtain the characteristics of each noise source. Since the doppler phenomenon causes a fre- quency shift during a pass-by noise test, the doppler correction and time delay effects are incorporated into the estimation of pass-by noise. Combining the entire data from the action of the prior tests, a simulation program was developed for analyzing each noise source contribution and predicting the overall pass-by noise as a function of the vehicle location. Finally, the developed program can furnish an in-depth understanding of the effect of each noise source to pass-by noise. 2001-01-1564. Pass-by noise prediction for trucks based on powertrain test-cell measurements. Martin Pflueger, AVL List GmbH; and Kaj Bodlund, Volvo Truck Corp. The paper outlines and discusses the possibilities of a new instru- mentation tool for the analysis of engine and gearbox noise radiation and the prediction of pass-by noise from powertrain test cell mea- surements. Based on a 32 channel data acquisition board, the system is intended to be quick and easy to apply in order to support engineers during their daily work in the test cell. The pass-by prediction is a purely experimental approach with test cell recordings being weighted by measured transfer functions (from the powertrain com- partment to the pass-by point). 2001-01-1565. Combining vehicle and test-bed diagnosis information to guide vehicle development for pass-by noise. A. R. Fleszar and P. J. G. van der Linden, LMS Engineering Services ; J. R. Johnson, General Motors Noise and Vibration Center ; and M. J. Grimmer, General Motors Powertrain Division. Typically pass-by noise evaluation is performed very late in the vehicle development cycle and any changes or modifications are costly, making an exterior modeling procedure compatible with both test and math-based techniques desirable. This paper demonstrates how the Airborne Source Quantification (ASQ) technique can be applied to modeling vehicle exterior noise. The results of this study also show that the source strength of individual sub-systems, i.e., the engine or transmission, can be determined independently from the full vehicle using a sub-system dynamometer. Results are correlated by assessing source strength and overall pass-by sound pressure level. 2001-01-1566. Analysis of transient noise behavior of a truck diesel engine. Marcel Dhaenens and Gijs van der Linden, DAF Trucks; Jakob Nehl, FEV Motorentechnik ; and Rainer Thiele, RWTH Aachen, VKA. Based on NVH tests conducted on a heavy-duty turbocharged DI diesel engine, noise relevant differences between steady-state and transient operating condition were investigated. A vehicle drive-by test simulating the effects of vehicle mass and inertia was per- formed, followed by transient NVH measurements in a semi- anechoic test cell. Steady-state noise was exceeded by 5 dBA during transient oper- ation due to broadband increase of noise excitation combined with structure resonance amplification. Transient noise results mainly from 'harsher' combustion as a consequence of enlarged ignition delay indicated by significant increase in maximum cylinder pres- sure gradient. Variation of geartrain excitation and combustion exci- tation revealed that geartrain noise is of minor importance in this context. Transient noise improvement must focus on reducing ignition delay, for instance by increasing combustion chamber temperature, optimization of injection rate (controlling the amount of premixed fuel at start of combustion) and advancing begin of injection in com- pliance with adequate NVH and excellent drivability. Transient tests should be implemented in the diesel engine NVH development process, since steady-state parameter variations do not reflect the individual transient NVH behavior of the engine. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1567. Pass-by noise on different concrete surfaces - A Canadian experiment. Brian V. Chapnik, HGC Engineering. A comprehensive study was undertaken to evaluate the effective- ness of different proposed low-noise surface treatments for concrete road pavements. The acoustical results of that study are described in this paper. Several consecutive 500 meter long trial sections were integrated as part of a newly constructed concrete freeway. These trial sections included several control sections of regular transversely fined con- crete, a randomly fined section, and a number of different exposed aggregate concrete (EAC) surfaces of different aggregate types and sizes, all surfaced using a shotblasting method. 204</page><page sequence="204">2001-01-1567-2001-01-1573 Controlled tests were performed prior to opening of the highway, and uncontrolled tests were performed just after the highway was opened using the statistical pass-by (SPB) method. Both sets of this initial data indicated that the shotblasted surfaces were all approxi- mately 1/2 dB quieter than the transversely tined control pavements, although it was noted that the variability between the different con- trol surfaces was on this same order. It was also found that the con- trol sections were among the quietest of Portland Concrete Cement (PCC) pavements, having an emission level almost 2 dB quieter than the FHWA average for PCC, and that the randomly tined sur- face was almost 2 dB louder than the controls. Follow-up testing performed a year after the highway opened indicated only subtle changes relative to the initial results, with most trial pavements including the control sections becoming slightly (1/2 dB) quieter. 2001-01-1568. The effect of temperature on pass-by noise. Robert G. Saville, Machinery Acoustics. Repetitive J-366 pass-by tests were run on a number of trucks to determine the effect of atmospheric conditions on the measured pass-by noise level. Of the atmospheric conditions observed (tem- perature, wind, humidity, air density &amp; sunshine), only ambient tem- perature had a significant effect on measured pass-by noise. Mea- sured pass-by noise level increased approximately 1 dB (A) for each 13°C drop in temperature. Data indicates that applying a generic correction factor based on engine type is more accurate than ignor- ing the effect of temperature. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1569. Some factors in the subjective evaluation of laboratory simulated ride. William Pielemeier, Jejfry Greenberg, Ray Meier, Vadivelu Jeyabalan , and Norman C. Otto, Ford Motor Co. Effects of DOF and subjective method on evaluations of ride quality on the Ford Vehicle Vibration Simulator were studied. Seat track vibrations from 6 vehicles were reproduced on the 6 DOF seat shaker in a DOE with pitch and roll as factors. These appeared in two evaluations of ride/shake; semantic scaling by 30 subjects of 6 vehicles, and paired comparisons by 16 of the subjects on 3 of the vehicles. Both methods found significant vehicle, pitch and roll effects. Order dependence was shown for semantic scaling. The less susceptible paired comparison method gave a different ordering, and is thus preferred. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1570. Sound and vibration quality map for commer- cial vehicles. Martin Pflueger and Wolfgang Stuecklschwaiger, AVL List GmbH. Last year, a new method for the analysis of vehicle interior sound quality, was extended to cover applications to commercial vehicles. With the AVL VOICE system, sound qualities such as the perceived 'annoyance' or impressions like 'powerful' can be analyzed objec- tively. Due to the fact that in the field of commercial vehicles, the assessment of vibration quality has become equally important, this system is currently being extended by modules for the measurement of vehicle vibration quality. The advantages of this development tool for manufacturers of commercial vehicles lie in the fact that development effort is considerably reduced, quality target parame- ters are defined and quality 'benchmarking tests' can be carried out. 2001-01-1571. Factors affecting truck driver's perceived comfort. Rayya Hassan and Kerry McManus, Swinburne University of Technology. Truck driver's perception of ride quality/comfort is influenced by many factors relating to the driver, the vehicle and road surface roughness. A subjective rating survey was undertaken to identify the range of roughness wavelengths in the longitudinal road surface pro- file that affect the perceived ride of heavy articulated vehicles. They were found to range between 4.8 and 19.5 meters. Accordingly, a new roughness index called Profile Index (PI) was established. Dur- ing the survey, data was collected on factors such as driver's age, years of driving experience, weight, vehicle's age, loading condi- tion, cab location, type of driving axle suspension, weather condi- tion and time of the rating. The effects of these factors were studied at different PI levels to test the viability of the PI as a measure of the perceived heavy vehicle ride and to establish if any of the above factors influenced the drivers' judgments during the survey. The effects of most of these factors proved to be not significant for the PI range used except for the cab location and time of rating factors. As the PI explains 83% of the variation in the mean panel ratings and the other factors account for a much smaller portion; it was con- cluded that the PI is a viable measure of the perceived truck ride. 2001-01-1572. Road vibration investigation using the Ford vehicle vibration simulator. Scott Amman and Bill Pielemeier, Ford Research Lab; and Dave Snyder and Ferdinand Toting, Ford Truck Vehicle Center. In-vehicle subjective evaluations of a mid-sized SUV exhibited an objectionable vibration character when driven over smooth road surfaces with minor rolling irregularities. As a result, a project was initiated to systematically identify problem frequency components and degrees-of-freedom that contribute to the phenomenon some- times referred to as 'nervousness.' The Ford Vehicle Vibration Sim- ulator (VVS) was used to simulate the vibrations felt on the road. Eleven degree-of-freedom (DOF) simulations were produced. The seat simulation contained three translational (vertical, lateral and longitudinal) and three rotational (pitch, yaw and roll) DOFs. The steering wheel consisted of all three translational components in addition to the DOF associated with wheel rotation. The floorpan was excited in the vertical direction only. By systematically elimi- nating various DOFs, it was determined that the seat contributed the most to the objectionable vibration. The steering wheel was the next important contributor followed by the floorpan. Various simulations were created in which certain spectral components were either par- tially or completely eliminated using FIR zero-phase filters. Whether or not a component was filtered depended on its spectral prominence for the particular degree-of-freedom being addressed. At the seat track, the nervous character was most affected by 10.5, 11, 15, 17 and 17.5 Hz components. At the steering wheel, compo- nents in the 30-32 Hz range and the 36 Hz component attenuated together resulted in a perceivable difference. In general, a 6 dB reduction of the components was necessary to significantly improve the ride and place the vehicle among the leaders for this phenome- non. Finally, operational deflection shapes taken from on-road data were used to uncover potential sources of these spectral compo- nents. These sources, and measures to reduce their contributions, are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1573. A software tool for noise quality and brand sound development. W. Biermayer, S. Thomann, and F. Brandl, AVL LIST GmbH. For noise quality and brand sound design of passenger cars a unique software tool is currently used by our clients world-wide to evaluate and optimize the interior noise quality and brand sound aspects of passenger cars on an objective basis. The software tools AVL- VOICE and AVL-COMFORT are designed for the objective analysis of interior noise quality, for benchmarking, for the definition of noise quality targets and most important for effective vehicle sound engineering. With this tool, the target orientated implementation of the required interior noise qual- ity or brand sound by predictable hardware modifications into pas- senger cars - for tailor made joy of driving - becomes feasible. The use of this tools is drastically reducing vehicle evaluation time and sound engineering effort when compared with traditional jury subjective evaluation methods and standard acoustic NVH optimization procedures. 205</page><page sequence="205">2001-01-1573-2001-01-1581 The successful implementation of a desired brand sound into the vehicle requires extensive knowledge of how a particular brand sound has to be composed and how this composition can be trans- ferred into relevant hardware modifications. Examples on brand sound engineering will be presented as well in this paper. 2001-01-1574. Determining hearing threshold of interior noise using adaptive procedure. Lijian (Lee) Zhang , Timothy Kai- ser , and Dale Hopkins , Delphi Automotive Systems. A jury evaluation study has been conducted to determine the hearing threshold of IP gauge stepping motor noise using a trans- formed up-down procedure. The stepping motor noise was recorded in an anechoic chamber and was used as a signal in the study. To determine the masked threshold, this signal was adjusted to various gain levels and mixed with interior engine noise at selected rpm as masking noise. In this study, the Adaptive Procedure was used, and a software application was developed for this purpose. Twenty sub- jects, selected based on hearing test results, participated in this jury evaluation. The findings of this study indicated that Adaptive Proce- dure is an effective approach in determining hearing threshold for automotive applications. A design criterion for acoustical character- istics of the IP gauge DC motor noise has been developed based on the results of this study. 2001-01-1575.

Roughness applied to automotive acoustic also in respect with diesel and gasoline engines is defined. Measurement and evaluation technologies and methods in respect of single and multiple sources are discussed and described with applications in a test-vehicle. Typical airborne and structural-borne noise paths and interfaces beginning at the engine and transmitted to the interior will be further described and evaluated. The adaptation and improvement of interface parts prior identi- fied as a relevant path is discussed and the optimization steps pres- ented in terms of noise-level reduction and/or subjective noise behavior. 2001-01-1576. Shunt piezo damping of a radiating panel. Reza Kashani and Ali Mazdeh, University of Dayton; and Jeff Orze- chowski, DaimlerChrysler. The performance of shunt piezo damping is demonstrated by adding damping to the first mode of a plate with the dimensions of 28 by 38 cm and thickness of 0.8 mm. A small 1 by 2 inch piezoelec- tric patch with the thickness of 10 mil is bonded to the plate at a location where strain due to the first mode of vibration is high. The peizo is shunted with a resistance-inductance (RL) circuit, tuned to the first resonance frequency of the plate at 38 Hz. The plate is excited at its first natural frequency and the power spectrums of the acceleration at the center of the plate with and without the damping treatment were measured. These measurements showed that the shunt piezo damping treatment tuned to the first mode added an appreciable amount of damping to that mode. 2001-01-1577. Torsional vibration absorbers: A testing and evaluation apparatus. Alan G. Haddow and Steven W. Shaw, Mich- igan State Univ. A device has been designed and built to allow one to systemati- cally investigate the dynamical behavior of a wide variety of tor- sional vibration absorbers (TV As). These are devices that can pas- sively absorb the torsional vibration of a wide range of rotating sys- tems. The testing device allows different operating conditions to be studied and similarities and discrepancies between theoretical pre- dictions and experimental results can be made. The manuscript emphasizes the design and capabilities of the device and discusses the instrumentation of the system. It also presents a limited number of experimental results along with the associated theoretical predictions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1578. New method for producing 6-degree-of- freedom random vibration. Joe H. Morrill II, Entela, Inc. This paper describes one method for producing random 6-axis vibration within an accelerated test process to expedite design verifi- cation. The concept behind accelerated testing to identify failure modes and achieve product improvement is reviewed. The machine is presented as an alternative to existing technologies within the accelerated testing process. Together, the concept and machine are presented to engineers as a possible tool to verify new designs and discover non-intuitive failure modes prior to releasing a design for production. The theory of operation and the performance parameters of the machine are also discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1579. Polytopic modeling and state observer synthe- sis for suspension system with variant damping and stiffness. Du Wang and Ichiro Hagiwara, Tokyo Institute of Technology; and Zhongyang Guo, Hino Motors Ltd. This paper presents the polytopic modeling method and state variable observer design approach for semi-active suspension with changeable damping and variant stiffness elements. And such semi- active suspension system is suitable to be modeled as a dynamic polytopic system where the extreme vertices of damping and stiff- ness values are taken as the convex vertices of polytope. Thus, a dynamic polytopic model is the convex synthesis with all the vertex system dynamics and linear system theory can be applied to the sys- tem at each vertex. Herein, the conventional Kaiman filter theory is utilized to design the observer for each vertex system, then the polytopic observer is formulated by a convex synthesis. The pro- posed observer design approach is testified by numerical study and vehicle test. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1580. Polytopic bilinear system modeling and non- linear H°o control design for semi-active suspension system. Zhongyang Guo, Hino Motors Ltd. ; and Du Wang and Ichiro Hagi- wara, Tokyo Institute of Technology. As an important class of nonlinear system, polytopic bilinear sys- tem is investigated. Combined with the properties of convex poly- tope, the nonlinear control for polytopic bilinear system is formu- lated by synthesizing nonlinear H°° controller which is designed for polytopic bilinear system at vertices. For a semi-active suspension system with controllable damping and variant stiffness elements, it is easily modeled as a polytopic bilinear system model. In this case, the desired nonlinear control properties are pursued in making effec- tive use of the changeable damping property while the variant stiff- ness is taken as the affine parameter of polytopic model. Therefore, polytopic bilinear system model could be reduced to a feasible prob- lem by polytopic convex decomposition. Then the control problem of bilinear system model is to find a solution of nonlinear H&lt;*&gt; con- trol. Here, the merits in using nonlinear H&lt;*&gt; state feedback control are that it can confine the damping force output to 1st and 3rd phase planes where changeable damping force is produced and its nonlin- ear control output makes a fast state origin convergence in keeping small vibration and motion. In this paper, a practical control design demonstration for a polytopic bilinear suspension system is described after the theory description. The simulation study and experimental results demonstrate the effective control performance in improving ride comfort. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1581. Optimizing vehicle response in a combined ride and handling full car model by optimal control strategies. V. Nikzad S. and M. Naraghi, Amirkabir University of Technology. 206</page><page sequence="206">2001-01-1581-2001-01-1592 This paper focuses on the control of combined ride and handling full car model of a Four- Wheel-Steering (4WS) Vehicle and deter- mines how can ride and handling influence together by the road irregularities and front and rear steering inputs and disturbances like side wind. A 9 DOF linear full car model is discussed as the controller model, which controls a 9 DOF nonlinear full car model. Control inputs are 4 actuators for each wheel that control vertical displace- ment of sprung mass and 2 actuators for rear wheels that control the rear steering angle. The model describes vertical and lateral dis- placements and rotations and it is considered to have quasi-static conditions in longitudinal displacement. Control strategies that are used in this paper are Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Dynamic Programming that regulates vertical displacements and tracks the yaw rate reference. 2001-01-1582. Robust analysis of vehicle suspension system uncertainty. Fangwu Ma and Roger Hibberd, Imperial College ; and Yongxin Men , Ford Motor Co. The paper presents the systematic approaches toward robust sta- bility analysis of H2/H(infinity) controlled active suspension sys- tems. The computational algorithms for the structured singular value ļu are the main features of the work with an emphasis on quantifying the effects of uncertainty of the systems. The representation of vehicle parameter uncertainties is given in detail. The robustness test is subsequently done based on a quarter vehicle model. The results have showed that the H(inflnity) controller is the best one on both robust stability and robust performance. 2001-01-1583. Micromachined servo accelerometer for harsh environments. Thomas F. Connolly , Endevco. Endevco has developed the Model MSA 100 A micromachined servo accelerometer. It utilizes a force-balance approach that dem- onstrates superior performance over a conventional 'open loop.' The accelerometer is small and rugged, with superior low frequency response down to DC. It has been optimized to provide low level measurements in the presence of severe vibrational inputs and tem- perature extremes after being subjected to large shock impacts. This paper details the design and operational features of the sen- sor element. The micromachined silicon sensor uses MEMS tech- nology (microelectromechanical systems) in its fabrication. Also described is the electronic circuit used in the force-balance system, as well as the packaging of the accelerometer. Test results and appli- cation experience are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1587.

The design and architecture lend themselves to real-time NVH measure- ments and analysis in the field, in- vehicle or on production lines. Built-in signal conditioning provides for direct sensor power while the embedded DSP provides for signal processing on-board.

Mike Blommer and Norm Otto, Ford Motor Co. In assessing the sound quality of electric motors (e.g., seat, mir- ror, and adjustable pedal motors), the sensation of Fluctuation Strength - a measure of intensity or frequency variation - has become important. For electric motors, it is typically caused by vari- ation in the load, creating frequency modulation in the sound. An existing method for calculating Fluctuation Strength proved useful initially, but more extensive testing identified unacceptable perfor- mance. There were unacceptable levels of both false positives and false negatives. A new method is presented, which shows improved correlation with perceived fluctuation in sounds. Comparisons are made to the previous method and improvement is shown through examples of objective-subjective correlation for both seat motor sounds and adjustable pedal motor sounds. The new method is also shown to match subjective data from which the original measure of Fluctua- tion Strength was derived. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-1590. Subjective evaluation of NVH CAE model pre- dictions using an operator-in-the-loop driving simulator. Greg Goetchius, Cary Ketelhut, and Brian Smallwood, DaimlerChrysler Corp. ; and Chris Eaton, Head Acoustics. In the past several years there has been a significant effort to increase the reliance on CAE technology to guide the vehicle design process, with the accompanying effort to reduce or eliminate vehicle prototype testing during the early design phase. Since little or no representative hardware is available early in the design, a tool is needed which allows NVH Development Engineers to subjectively experience the results of NVH CAE model predictions in a realistic driving environment. This paper documents the development of a high-fidelity NVH simulator, including both audio and vibration, and the integration of this simulator into an 'operator-in-the-loop' Driving Simulator. The key development of this system is its ability to incorporate NVH CAE predictions into the simulated driving environment. However, the technical challenge of generating and controlling synchronized audio and vibration signals of sufficient fidelity in an operator-in-the-loop environment is a significant task and will also be addressed. 2001-01-1591. Virtual environment for subjective evaluation of synthesized sound. Oliver Nwankwo, Collins &amp; Aikman Corp.; and Benjamin Cimerman, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Modern PCs are built on multimedia processors designed to han- dle computer-generated three-dimensional image as well as stereo sound in real time. In this paper we report on research that takes advantage of these recent capabilities. A prototyping system designed to provide an enhanced visual and auditory experience of the interior noise performance of a vehicle was developed. The sys- tem can be used for the subjective evaluation of modifications to the sound package of an existing vehicle. The latest virtual reality tech- nology is combined with digital sound processing and Statistical Energy Analysis simulation to provide the user with a unique visual and auditory experience. 2001-01-1592. How to predict powertrain vibration at the engine mounting points under running conditions. Yasuhiko Seki, Toshibumi Suzuki, Masayoshi Tsukahara, and Yukitaka Takahashi, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Recently, the eigenvalue analysis and the frequency response analysis using the finite element method (FEM) is commonly used, since the vibration characteristic of the powertrain is an important specification which causes the influence on the booming noise and the durability of each parts. However, the eigenvalue analysis and the frequency response analysis cannot take into account of the dynamic behavior of the cranktrain and the nonlinear characteristics. This paper presents a new approach which considers the dynamic behavior of the crankshaft and the nonlinear oil film characteristics of the main bearings and the engine mounts for accurately predicting the vibration level at the engine mounting points under running con- ditions. By applying this approach to an in-line four cylinder engine, the predicted vibration level is reasonably comparable with experi- mental result. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 207</page><page sequence="207">2001-01-1593-2001-01-1599 2001-01-1593. Simulation method for Geartrain NVH assess- ment and optimization. Hans-Peter Lahey, Christoph Steffens, and Christof Schultz, FEV Motorentechnik. Geartrain-related noise has become a more dominant noise con- cern mainly due to the increasing demand for high-pressure injec- tion systems. Engine geartrain noise is mainly caused by torque fluctuations of the crankshaft and the injection system, both leading to tooth impacts between the gears of the geartrain. Gear impacts can generate dominant NVH problems due to the high frequency content of the gear impact forces, although their amplitudes are much lower than those of the combustion forces. If the natural fre- quencies of the surrounding structure are met, an intensive radiation of the surrounding structure is caused. FEV has developed a simulation method for the analysis of geartrain dynamics aimed at identifying and optimizing potential noise sources. This simulation method is an essential tool for the development process of a technical product. It realizes a minimum effort to set up the model at reduced calculation time. Since the method is based on a combination of Finite Element analysis (FEA) and Multi-Body System Analysis (MBA), two simulation models need to be constructed. The FEA model is used to investigate the vibration behavior of the geartrain and its individual components, whereas the MBA model simulates the dynamics of the geartrain. The article summarizes the experience gathered in several proj- ects with modern diesel engines. The applied simulation method will be described; assessment techniques and their results will be explained. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1594. Efficient engine models using recursive formu- lation of multibody dynamics. Zheng-Dong Ma and N. C. Perkins, University of Michigan. Engine models with fully coupled dynamic effects of the engine components can be constructed through the use of commercial mul- tibody dynamics codes, such as ADAMS and DADS. These com- mercial codes provide a modeling platform for very general mechanical systems and the time and effort required to learn how to use them may preclude their use for some engine designers. In this paper, we review an alternative and specialized modeling plat- form that functions as a template for engine design. Relative to com- mercial codes, this engine design template employs a recursive for- mulation of multibody dynamics, and thus it leads directly to the minimum number of equations of motion describing the dynamic response of the engine by a priori satisfaction of kinematic con- straints. This is achieved by employing relative coordinates in lieu of the absolute coordinates adopted in commercial multibody dynamics codes. This engine modeling tool requires only minimal information for the input data. As a further benefit, the engine mod- els herein are cast purely as a (minimum) set of ordinary differential equations of motion in lieu of the differential-algebraic equations that result from using commercial multibody dynamics codes. These differences lead to engine models that may also be integrated with greater efficiency. Major components of the engine model include a rigid engine block, a flexible crankshaft, any number of cylinders with rigid pis- tons and connecting rods, any number of main bearings (represented by linear, nonlinear, or hydrodynamic bearing models), any number of engine mounts (represented by linear or nonlinear viscoelastic engine mount models). The objective of this paper is to review the current progress on developing an engine model template to support up-front engine design for noise, vibration, and durability. 2001-01-1595. Engine excitation decomposition methods and V engine results. Joseph L. Stout, Ford Motor Co. Engine excitation forces have been studied in the past using one of two methods; a lumped sum or a totally distributed approach. The lumped sum approach gives the well-understood engine inherent unbalance and the totally distributed approach is used in engine CAE models to determine the overall engine response. The approach that will be described in this paper identifies an intermedi- ate level of sophistication. The methodology implemented considers single cylinder forces on the engine block, piston side thrust and main bearing forces, and decomposes them into their order content. The forces are then phased and geometrically distributed appropriately for each cylinder and then each order is analyzed relative to know distributions that are NVH concerns, V-block breathing, block side wall breathing, and block lateral and vertical bending. This analysis provides insight into the relative magnitude and frequency of the excitation driving each of the distributions and ana- lyzes differences that can be attributed to the number of cylinders, the bank angle and the firing order. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1596. Engine internal dynamic force identification and the combination with engine structural and vibro-acoustic transfer information. J. Van Herbruggen and P. J. G. van der Lin- den, LMS Engineering Services; and H.-J. Knittel and J. Schnur, DaimlerChrysler. The vibration-generating mechanisms inside an engine are highly non-linear (combustion, valve operation, hydraulic bearing behavior, etc.). However, the engine structure, under the influence of these vibration-generating mechanisms, responds in a highly lin- ear way. For the development and optimization of the engine structure for noise and vibration it is beneficial to use fast and 'simple' linear models, like linear FE-models, measured modal models or measured FRF-models. All these models allow a qualitative assessment of variants without excitation information. But, for true optimization, internal excitation spectra are needed in order to avoid that effort is spent to optimize non-critical system properties. Unfortunately, these internal excitation spectra are difficult to measure. Direct measurement of combustion pressure is still feasi- ble, but crank-bearing forces, piston guidance forces, etc., can only be identified indirectly. Inverse identification of the main internal excitations through operational acceleration measurements, com- bined with laboratory tests of FRF matrices, is the only possibility. This paper discusses inverse engine internal force identification using operational accelerations and laboratory FRF-matrices and the use of engine FRF matrices to assess modifications and variants with and without this excitation information. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1598. Effects of air and road surface temperature on tire pavement noise on an ISO 10844 surface. Brian J. Landsber- ger, Caterpillar, Inc.; Jeffrey DeMoss, Dell Computer Co., Inc.; and Michael McNerney, University of Texas. Sound pressure level (SPL) measurements of vehicle coast-by runs of a passenger vehicle were performed across a range of tem- peratures. A controlled test track was used for the runs with six dif- ferent sets of tires. A small but significant reduction of noise level with positive temperature increases was observed for some but not all tires. The reduction was evident in two of the tires at 53 kph and five of the tires at 80 kph. The SPL of the other tires showed little or no sensitivity to temperature. Frequency analysis of the tire noise showed that noise content above 1000 Hz is most affected by tem- perature change and noise in the range of 1200 to 2000 Hz is particu- larly sensitive to temperature changes. However, differences in SPL due to speed and tire type were much greater than that due to temperature. 2001-01-1599. A dynamometer for automobile brake squeal study. Thomas R. Terrell, Edward J.

A new analysis method for brake squeal Part I: Theory for modal domain formulation and stability analysis. Chih-Hung Chung and William Steed , MTS Systems; and Kiyoshi Kobayashi and Hiroyuki Nakata , Honda R&amp;D. The complex eigenvalue method is commonly used to evaluate brake squeal. This method however does not provide a way to account for variations in modeling, operation and manufacturing. Nor does it provide a clear strategy to fix brake squeal problems. In this study, we present a new modeling approach, which addresses the modal uncertainty issues and provides a strategy to fix squeal problems. The major contribution of this paper is transferring the stability analysis from the physical domain to modal domain. By this transformation, we are able to examine the coupling strength between modes and locate the unstable modes that cause squeal problems. We develop a new stability metric based on the modal coupling strength, which can be used to evaluate design modifica- tions for improvement and takes into account modal variation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1602. Analysis of instabilities and power flow in brake systems with coupled rotor modes. J. Gregory McDaniel andXianhui Li, Boston Univ.; James Moore, Consultant; and Shih- Emn Chen, Ford Motor Co. Recent investigations by others have indicated that the dynamic response of automotive brake rotors in the squeal frequency range involves the classic flexural modes as well as in-plane motion. While the latter set creates primarily in-plane displacements, there is coupling to transverse displacements that might produce vibra- tional instabilities. This question is investigated here by analyzing a modal model that includes two modes of the rotor and two modes of the pad and caliper assembly. Coupling between in-plane and transverse displacements is explicitly controlled. Results from this model indicate that the coupling does create vibrational instabilities. The instabilities, whose frequencies are in the squeal range, are characterized by power flow through the transverse motion of the rotor. 2001-01-1603. Advances in complex eigenvalue analysis for brake noise. T. S. Shi, O. Dessouki, and T. Warzecha, General Motors Corp.; W. K. Chang, Optimal Engineering; and A. Jaya- sundera, EASi Engineering. Brake squeal has been analyzed by finite elements for some time. Among several methods, complex eigenvalue analysis is proving useful in the design process. It requires hardware verification and it falls into a simulation process. However, it is fast and it can pro- vide guidance for resolving engineering problems. There are suc- cesses as well as frustrations in implementing this analysis tool. Its capability, robustness and reliability are closely examined in many companies. Generally, the low-frequency squealing mechanism is a rotor axial direction mode that couples the pads, rotor, and other compo- nents; while higher frequency squeal mainly exhibits a rotor tangen- tial mode. Design modifications such as selection of rotor design, insulator, chamfer, and lining materials are aimed specifically to cure these noise-generating mechanisms. In General Motors Corpo- ration, complex eigenvalue analysis is used for brake noise analysis and noise reduction. Finite element models are validated with com- ponent modal testing. Also dynamometer and vehicle test results are compared with finite element results. From several vehicle level brake noise analyses, our experience shows that complex mode shapes are capable of depicting the noise generating mechanisms, and the complex eigenvalues are able to depict the noise frequen- cies. Production brake squeal models using complex root analysis can be stabilized by an optimization procedure that is available in MSC/ Nastran V2001. Since there are many closely spaced modes in a brake squeal model, a design change to stabilize roots in a frequency range is a very difficult task. However, with an optimization proce- dure the stabilization can be automatically achieved. After identifying noise generating mechanisms and creating rep- resentative analysis model, several brake corners were analyzed for brake noise performance in the case studies. Figures showing the analysis results are included. Possible countermeasures were sug- gested, and the results showed improved noise performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1604. Investigation of disc brake squeal via sound intensity and laser vibrometry. Kenneth A. Cunefare and Ryan Rye, Georgia Institute of Technology. This paper presents an experimental investigation of methods for disc brake squeal source localization. The underlying data for the localization methods considered here was obtained through the use of a sound intensity probe and a scanning laser vibrometer. The abil- ity to correctly identify the squeal sources is an essential first step in diagnosing brake squeal. Localization methods based upon the use of sound intensity and laser vibrometry, when used together, are shown to converge successfully upon squeal sources. The sound intensity probe is used to spatially locate regions of airborne squeal noise in the near field of the brake rotor and caliper system mounted on a brake squeal dynamometer. The scanning laser vibrometer is then used to further investigate the vibration behavior of the brake assembly within these suspect regions. In addition to mapping near- field acoustic 'hot spots' to local regions of high surface normal velocity, additional source identification methods explored in this paper include the use of the coherence between the airborne squeal noise and local surface vibration, the use of a partial-area sound power calculation, and the Null-Search Method. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1605. Disc brake rotor squeal suppression using ditber control. Kenneth A. Cunefare and Aaron J. Graf, Georgia Institute of Technology. 'Dither' control recently has been experimentally demonstrated to be an effective means to suppress and prevent rotor mode disc brake squeal. Dither control employs a control effort at a frequency higher, oftentimes significantly higher, than the disturbance to be controlled. The control actuator used for the work presented in this paper is a piezoelectric stack actuator located within the piston of a floating caliper brake. The actuator is driven in open-loop control at a frequency greater than the squeal frequency. This actuator con- figuration and drive signal produces a small fluctuation about the mean clamping force of the brake. The control exhibits a threshold behavior, where complete suppression of brake squeal is achieved once the control effort exceeds a threshold value. This paper exam- ines the dependency of the threshold effort upon the frequency of the dither control signal, applied to the suppression of a 5.6 kHz rotor squeal mode. Threshold performance will be evaluated at a number of discrete dither control frequencies ranging into the ultra- sonic frequency regime. The tradeoff in the use of dither control is the generation of a rotor response at the dither control frequency. With ultrasonic control frequencies, the rotor response at the control frequency is inaudible. 2001-01-1606. Operational spindle load estimation methodol- ogy for road NVH applications. Joonhyung Park, Kelly Technical Services; and Perry Gu, Joe Juan, Archie Ni, and James Van Loon, Ford Motor Co. A new experimental methodology has been developed to quan- tify spindle loads of a vehicle under actual operational conditions. The methodology applies an indirect six degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) 209</page><page sequence="209">2001-01-1606-2001-01-1612 frequency response function (FRF) measurement technique to obtain three translation/force and three rotation/moment FRFs of the suspension system of the vehicle. The Inverse Frequency Response Function (IFRF) method estimates the spindle loads under opera- tional conditions. The feasibility and applicability of the developed methodology for vehicle road NVH applications was experimentally demonstrated. The results show that the methodology provides accurate spindle load estimation over a broad frequency range. This methodology can be used for benchmarking and target setting of spindle loads to achieve desired road NVH performance as well as for diagnosing root causes in problem solving applications. Further- more, for system engineering approach of the road NVH, this meth- odology can also be applied to road NVH cascade processes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1607. Steering wheel vibration diagnosis. M. A. Demers, Ford Motor Co. The objective of this project was to develop a methodology for the diagnosis of vibrations of the vehicle's steering wheel. This paper will describe an attempt at developing a systematic approach for describing the vibrations felt, what the sources might be, and how various steering system parameters might affect the vibrations. 2001-01-1608. Aluminum rail rivet and steel rail weld DOE and CAE studies for NVH. Josh W. Huang and Hau F. Sin , Ford Motor Co. Vehicle body with aluminum-riveted construction instead of steel welded one will be a big challenge to NVH. In this paper, alu- minum and steel rails with the dimensions similar to the rear rail portion of a typical mid-size sedan were fabricated. Rivets were used to assemble the aluminum rails while welds were used to assemble the steel rails. Adhesive, rivet/weld spacing, and rivet/ weld location were the three major factors to be studied and their impact on NVH were investigated. The DOE matrix was developed using these three major factors. Modal tests were performed on those rails according to the DOE matrix. The FEA models corre- sponding to the hardware were built. CAE modal analysis were per- formed and compared with test data. The current in-house CAE modeling techniques for spot weld and adhesive were evaluated and validated with test data. The conclusions from this study would determine which factors among adhesive, rivet/weld spacing, and rivet/weld location is critical for NVH performance. The results will also guide the CAE simulation of welds/rivets. 2001-01-1609. 2002 Pontiac Montana frequency improve- ments employing structural foam. Tony Banner and Michael Dambach, General Motors Corp.; and Paul Juras , Dow Automo- tive. This paper documents a joint development process between Gen- eral Motors Corporation and Dow Automotive to improve primary body structure frequencies on the General Motors Corporation fam- ily of midsize vans by utilizing cavity-filling structural foam. Opti- mum foam locations, foam quantity, and foam density within the body structure were determined by employing both math-based modeling and vehicle hardware testing techniques. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulations of the Body-In- White (BIW) and 'trimmed body' were used to predict the global body structure modes and associated resonant frequencies with and with- out structural foam. The objective of the FEA activity was to quan- tify frequency improvements to the primary body structure modes of matchboxing, bending, and torsion when using structural foam. Comprehensive hardware testing on the vehicle was also exe- cuted to validate the frequency improvements observed in the FEA results. BIW modal tests were performed before and after the addi- tion of structural foam to confirm the FEA predictions. A production vehicle was also foamed and modal tested to verify that improve- ments to the BIW were also comprehended at the full vehicle level. Hardware measurements from road response testing were also incor- porated into the evaluation matrix. Acceleration measurements (Power Spectral Density or PSD) at the steering wheel and seat track, and sound pressure level (SPL) measurements in the passen- ger compartment were collected to further evaluate the affect of structural foam on overall vehicle performance. BIW test results of a current production van yielded a first struc- tural mode frequency increase of 1 1% using 8 pcf (pounds per cubic foot) density foam and 35% using 24 pcf density foam. Additional advantages to foaming the vehicle were also observed in terms of improvements to interior sealing and reductions in low frequency interior noise levels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1610. Measurements of transmission and attenua- tion characteristics of fluidborne noise in fluid hoses with/ without tuning cables. Jinghong Yu and Silviu Popescu , Nichirin Inc. The transmission of fluid-borne pressure and flow pulsations through a hose assembly is dominated by a four-port transfer matrix equation. The potential of pulsation attenuation in the assembly is then related to the four parameters of the matrix by the concept of Transmission Loss.' The paper presents the development of an accurate test system, based on the 'Four Sensors/Two Systems' method, for measuring the transfer matrix and transmission loss of hose assemblies. Particular attention is paid to the solutions to some technical problems encountered during the development and mea- surement. Then presented is the application of the system to various types of flexible hose with or without tuning cables used in power steering hydraulic systems. The measurements are very valuable for developing the best tuning cable and hose devices, quieter power steering systems as well as the hoses used similarly in other fluid power systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1611. Hydraulic steering pump cavity flow CFD sim- ulation to improve NVH performance. LeeAnn Wang , Christian M. Fernholz , and Leonard Bishop , Visteon Corp. The objective of the present work was to improve automotive hydraulic steering system Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performance through an optimization of the hydraulic flow path through the steering pump. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to model the hydraulic steering pump pressure cavity flow. CFD simulation revealed that several pump housing features were creating obstructions in the flow of hydraulic fluid through the pump, which in turn generated a high degree of turbulence in the flow. An optimal steering pump housing design minimizing turbu- lent flow within the pump was selected using CFD analysis. An improvement in steering system NVH performance with this hous- ing design was verified through experimentation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1612. Determining source fluidborne noise charac- teristics of automotive fluid power pumps. Jinghong Yu, Nichirin Inc. A new method, the '3 Pressures/ 2 Systems' method, is devel- oped for determining source flow ripple and internal impedance of fluid power pumps. The method integrates exclusively an on-line measurement technique for the speed of sound in the fluid and a technique for eliminating flow disturbance effect on pressure sen- sors into the basic principle used in the existing '2 Pressures / 2 Sys- tems method. The new method has an inherent potential to yield results with higher accuracy and higher confidence. The high accu- racy of the method is confirmed by the comparison of measured and predicted pressure ripple in a pump-pipe-valve system. Then, the method is applied to automotive fluid power pumps - power steering pumps. The measured results of source flow ripple and internal impedance are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 210</page><page sequence="210">2001-01-1613-2001-01-1619 2001-01-1613. Active control of automotive air induction noise via source coupling, Ian R. McLean , Siemens Automotive Canada. Engine noise emanating from the air intake of automotive induc- tion systems can be effectively suppressed through active noise con- trol. Source coupling is used as the active noise control strategy. A small woofer, co-axially mounted inside the fresh air duct, is located in the plane of the fresh air intake and acts as the secondary noise source. An error microphone is located near the air intake and a syn- chronous reference signal is provided by an engine tachometer sig- nal. This active noise control system has been tested on several engines. The radiated engine noise from the induction system has been effectively eliminated over the control bandwidth. The power draw of the speaker is minimal and the flow restriction of the actively controlled inlet has been significantly reduced compared to the production air induction system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1614. Active boom noise damping of Dodge Durango. Reza Kashani , University of Dayton; and Jeff Orze- chowski , DaimlerChrysler. Two active boom noise damping techniques using a Helmholtz resonator-based compensator and a lead compensator called a posi- tive pressure feedback have been developed at the University of Dayton. The two damping techniques are of feedback type and their compensators can be implemented in software or hardware (using inexpensive operational amplifiers). The active damping system would rely on a speaker, a low-cost microphone, two accelerome- ters, and an electronic circuit (or a micro-controller) to add damping to the offending low-frequency vibroacoustic modes of the cavity. The simplicity of the active boom noise damping system lends itself to be incorporated into a vehicle's sound system. The Helmholtz resonator-based strategy is implemented on a Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle. The control scheme adds appreciable amount of damping to the first cavity mode and the first structurally induced acoustic mode of the cabin. 2001-01-1615. An electronically tunable resonator for noise control. Charles Birds ong, Dactron , Inc.; and Clark J. Radcliffe, Michigan State Univ. Many engineering systems create unwanted noise that can be reduced by the careful application of engineering noise controls. When this noise travels down tubes and pipes, a tuned resonator can be used to muffle noise escaping from the tube. The classical exam- ples are automobile exhaust and ventilation system noise. In these cases where a narrow frequency band of noise exists, a traditional engineering control consists of adding a tuned Helmholtz resonator to reduce unwanted tonal noise by reflecting it back to the source (Temkin, 1981). As long as the frequency of the unwanted noise falls within the tuned resonator frequency range, the device is effec- tive. However, if the frequency of the unwanted sound changes to a frequency that does not match the tuned resonator frequency, the device is no longer effective. Conventional resonators have fixed tuning and cannot effectively muffle tonal noise with time-varying frequency. The electronically tunable Semi-active Helmholtz Resonator (SHR) is a novel noise control device that includes a combination of conventional acoustic components combined with a hybrid con- trol system. This device can be fully designed externally and attached to a primary acoustic system, such as a duct or pipe to reduce the transmission of tonal noise. It is adaptively tuned on-line to track a disturbance signal with slow time varying frequency. The paper presents a physical analytical model of the SHR, a power flow model that answers the question 'Where does the power go?' and finally demonstrates the effectiveness of the device with experimen- tal test results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1616. An analysis of regularization errors in gener- alized nearfield acoustical holography. S. Sureshkumar and S. T. Raveendra , Collins &amp; Aikman Corp. Nearfield Acoustical Holography (NAH) has traditionally been utilized in the identification of noise sources on planar structures. The planar NAH was subsequently extended to handle noise source identification on separable geometry such as cylindrical and spheri- cal surfaces using measurements taken on a conforming surface. Recent advances have replaced the mathematics of separable wave propagation with a Boundary Element Method (BEM)-based numerical formulation, enabling NAH to reconstruct sources on arbitrarily complex geometry with arbitrarily shaped measurement surfaces. However, this generalized NAH leads to the solution of a discrete ill-posed problem that requires solution through singular value decomposition (SVD) or iterative strategies. Various regular- ization schemes have been proposed in the literature of inverse prob- lems to be used in conjunction with SVD for robust inversion. Applications of these schemes to generalized NAH problems are beginning to appear in literature. We present a rigorous comparison of the regularization errors introduced by the Tikhonov regulariza- tion method used in conjunction with three techniques for the selec- tion of the regularization parameter; Generalized Cross Validation (GCV), the L Curve criterion and the Morozov discrepancy princi- ple. A model problem that encompasses all the complexities of a real-world generalized NAH application is presented to aid the eval- uation of these methods. The regularization errors introduced by each technique are contrasted for different levels of measurement noise in numerically synthesized holograms. 2001-01-1618. Validation of the EFEA method through cor- relation with conventional FEA and SEA results. Weiguo Zhang , Aimin Wang , and Nicholas Vlahopoulos, University of Michigan. The Energy Finite Element Analysis(EFEA) is a recent develop- ment for high-frequency vibro-acoustic analysis, and constitutes an evolution in the area of high-frequency computations. The EFEA is a wave-based approach, while the SEA is a modal based approach. In this paper the similarities in the theoretical development of the two methods are outlined. The main scope of this paper is to estab- lish the validity of the EFEA by analyzing several complex structur- al-acoustic systems. The EFEA solutions are compared successfully to SEA results and to solutions obtained from extremely dense con- ventional FEA models. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1619. An EFEM°-SEA integrated model of a trimmed van. Shuo Wang, Helen Hui Xu, and Gordon L. Ebbitt, Lear Corp. High-frequency responses of structural-acoustic systems may be predicted by statistical energy analysis (SEA) or energy finite ele- ment method (EFEM). To combine the good features of these two techniques, a simplified energy finite element method, referred to as EFEM0, has been developed recently. The EFEM0 technique, which is compatible with SEA, integrates the joint coupling proce- dures for discontinuous systems and the finite volume formulation for continuous system. The EFEM 0 models have been verified either analytically or experimentally for one- and multi-dimensional systems. In this study, the EFEM0 technique is applied to a passenger van for a noise control investigation. The general scheme is to incorpo- rate the EFEM0 coupling factors into a SEA model in order to release some SEA assumptions and improve the SEA model, espe- cially for relatively high damping, strong coupling and direct field cases. The EFEM°-SEA integrated model for the trimmed van is val- idated by experimental data. Several noise control strategies will be discussed for the integrated model to optimize the sound package. 211</page><page sequence="211">2001-01-1620-2001-01-1629 2001-01-1620. Mid-frequency vibration analysis of systems containing one type of energy based on a hybrid finite element formulation. Xi Zhao and Nickolas Vlahopoulos , University of Michigan. A hybrid finite element method (hybrid FEA) for computing mid-frequency vibrations for systems that contain one energy type is presented. In the mid-frequency range a system is comprised of both long and short members. Long members contain several wave- lengths and they are modeled by the Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFE A). Short members contain a small number of wavelengths and they are modeled by the Finite Element Analysis (FEA). External excitation can be applied on long and/or on short members. Systems are analyzed by both the hybrid FEA method and an analytical solu- tion in order to validate the hybrid FEA developments. The interac- tion among long and short members is defined by a set of equations between the EFEA and the FEA primary variables at the interfaces between long and short members. The numerical systems of equa- tions for the long and the short members, and the interface equations are solved simultaneously. Good correlation between analytical and hybrid results is observed for all analyses. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1621. Investigation and validation of transmission loss for vehicle components with a large aperture. Zhiming Luo and Marco Schneider , HP Pelzer (Automatic Systems ), Inc. ; and John G. Cherng, University of Michigan. Determination of the sound transmission loss (STL) of a vehicle component that has a large aperture, such as an air exhauster or an air extraction opening, always presents a challenge to an acoustics engineer. The complexity of the aperture's physical conditions can- not be easily solved with conventional, analytical or numerical methods. A systematic study of investigating the transmission loss characteristics of the large aperture is presented in this paper. Both conventional potential noise reduction predictions of large apertures and SEA simulations were performed. Transmission losses with dif- ferent acoustic treatments were measured and predicted when using AutoSEA2. Finally, correlation between measured results and predi- cations were developed. The ultimate goal of this study is to reduce the costly transmission loss measurements with correlated analytical estimations. 2001-01-1622. Problems with using in-vehicle acoustic absorption measurements to develop interior trim parts based on laboratory measurements. Robert J. Unglenieks and Phillip J. Eppard, Johnson Controls Inc. Setting accurate acoustic performance targets for trim compo- nents early in a vehicle program is essential to develop the vehicle on-time, with appropriate acoustical performance, at lowest weight, and at lowest cost. The laboratory measurement of acoustic absorp- tion (ASTM C423 and ISO 354) of flat stock trim parts is used to obtain these targets or the specific trim part is measured in a vehicle to obtain the acoustic absorption. However, the in situ measurement often does not agree with the laboratory measurement even if the variations between formed parts and flat stock materials are accounted for. A statistical energy analysis model is used to illus- trate the problems with in situ absorption measurements. An approach to correct the in situ test method to obtain an approxima- tion of the laboratory result is discussed. 2001-01-1623. Sound package design for a convertible by sta- tistical energy analysis. Terence Connelly , Lear Corp.; and Jian- min Guan, Ford Motor Co. The application of SEA (Statistical Energy Analysis) to the sound package design for a convertible is presented. SEA modeling was used optimize the soft-top construction and the acoustic insula- tion in the top-stack area (where the soft-top is stored) which were shown to be important transmission paths for tire noise. Correlation between measurement data and predictions from the SEA model is presented and good agreement shown. It is concluded that SEA can be applied to determine the special sound package requirements for convertible vehicles. 2001-01-1624. An assessment of SEA model quality. Mark J. Moeller, Robert S. Thomas, and Robert E. Powell, Ford Motor Co. Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) models are routinely being adopted in up-front automotive sound package design. SEA models serve two important functions. First they provide a means of assess- ing noise and vibration performance relative to absolute targets. Secondly, they are used to assess various alternative designs or changes required to meet targets. This paper addresses how to objec- tively evaluate both the absolute and relative predictive capability of SEA models. The absolute prediction is assessed using a hypothe- sis test to determine membership of the analytical prediction relative to a set of test data. The relative prediction is assessed using hard- ware-designed experiments to estimate design sensitivities. Both have been found useful to drive model improvement efforts. Being able to objectively document model capability also improves the credibility of SEA model predictions and the design information they deliver. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1625. A method to determine the power input associ- ated with rain excitation for SEA models. Marv Mealman and Rob Unglenieks, Johnson Controls Interiors, LLC; and Koorosh Naghshineh, Western Michigan Univ. Statistical Energy Analysis is used to predict the sound pressure level (SPL) in the interior of the vehicle. This is accomplished by knowing the energy sources (tire, engine, wind, etc.) affecting the interior as well as the acoustic performance (absorption and trans- mission loss) of the interior trim components (headliner, door pan- els, instrument panel, etc). One of the noise sources that has not been seriously examined to-date is panel excitation by precipitation. The excitation of the roof due to raindrops can be a major noise source. Knowing how to properly model this power input would help ana- lyze different headliners or roof treatments to minimize the SPL in the interior cavity. This will involve computational determination of mass, speed, and energy of standard water droplets for one of rain condition. A power spectrum is presented for one rain intensity con- dition on a test fixture. 2001-01-1628. Acoustic tuning of lightweight vehicle interior systems. C. T. Griffen, R. Wentzel, S. T.

This paper discusses the approach and application of controlling material and manufacturing parameters in development of light- weight acoustic interior systems. First addressed is the theoretical premise of noise control mechanisms and their relationship to mate- rial property/process sensitivity through poroelastic model simula- tion. The optimal balance of sound transmission loss and absorption in achieving optimally tuned acoustic performance is then presented along with material sample and in-vehicle experimental results. The ability to acoustically tune the vehicle interior to a desired sound level and frequency content through proper design &amp; control of the elastic porous properties achieved by unique acoustic material/ process flexibility &amp; capability is demonstrated. The acoustic tuning capability created from the material and manufacturing design space offers a family of acoustic solutions that provide up to 70% addi- tional weight benefit in comparison to other current vehicle acoustic interior system solutions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1629.

Noise source identification in a cab interior. Zakir Quabili, S. Sureshkumar, and S . T. Raveendra , Collins &amp; Aik- man Corp . Nearfield Acoustical Holography (NAH) has traditionally been utilized in the identification of noise sources on separable geometry of the wave equation. Recent advances have utilized the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to extend the source identification to noise sources with arbitrary geometry. However, this generalized NAH leads to the solution of a discrete ill-posed problem that requires solution through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in conjunc- tion with numerical regularization. Robust numerical regularization schemes have recently been implemented in commercial software COMET/Acoustics® so as to fully automate the noise source identi- fication procedure, and render it applicable to complex, practical problems. An application involving noise source identification on the interior of an earthmoving equipment cab is presented to demon- strate the capability of generalized NAH. The NAH reconstructed velocities on the surface of the cab are compared with the input velocities. The effects of having absorptive panels in the model or incorporating noise in the input pressure to NAH, on the predicted velocity distribution are also investigated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-1690. Transient air conditioning simulation using network theory algorithms. Josef Hager , Thomas Anzenberger, Roland Marzy , and Clemens Doppelbauer , Steyr- Daimler- Puch. An efficient air-conditioning system is an important factor for the commercial success of an automotive product, because of the ther- mal comfort for the passengers being an important incentive for the purchaser. A simulation tool is presented that makes it possible to design and optimize A/C refrigerant circuits together with the engine cooling system in a very early stage of the design process. This tool is based on networks including the enhanced heat exchange theory which also takes into consideration refrigerant phase changes. A graphical user interface and predefined simulation models which are based on the respective geometry of the system components make it easy to create a virtual vehicle for mathematical analysis of the various heat and mass flows. High flexibility and short calculation time together with high accuracy enable the engi- neer to make efficient investigations. 2001-01-1691.

Rapid electrochemical characterization of cor- rosion properties of aluminum brazing sheet by stepwise disso- lution measurement. S. D. Meijers and J. H. W. de Wit, Corns Research, Development &amp; Technology. For aluminium heat-exchangers one of the most accepted corro- sion tests is the SWAAT. It is widely used by both aluminum pro- ducers and manufacturers of heat-exchangers. However, in alloy development programs, as well as in production environments even faster characterization of corrosion properties of aluminum brazing sheet would be advantageous. The Stepwise Dissolution Measurement (SDM), which is an electrochemical technique, was developed in our laboratory to enable rapid screening of corrosion properties of aluminum brazing sheet. Within approximately 6 hours it is possible to distinguish between Long-Life (over 25 days SWAAT performance) and non- Long-Life materials. Cross section showed that the mode of attack in SDM is similar to the mode of attack in SWAAT exposure. 2001-01-1694. R134A suction line heat exchanger in different configurations of automotive air-conditioning systems. Marcus Preissner and Reinhard Radermacher, University of Maryland; Chao Zhang, Visteon Corp.; and Tim Dickson, Halla Climate Con- trol Canada Inc. A suction line heat exchanger (SLHX) transfers heat from the condenser outlet to the suction gas. In a TXV (thermostatic expan- sion valve) system, the performance improvement with a 60 to 80% effective SLHX is expected to be on the order of 8 to 10% for capac- ity, and 5 to 7% for COP for high outdoor air temperatures of 43°C. In a FOT (fixed orifice tube) system, the performance improvement was calculated to be about 10 to 15%. The calculated improvements have been verified experimentally within a few percent. 2001-01-1695. Development of engine cooling systems by cou- pling CFD simulation and heat exchanger analysis programs. Bernhard Uhl, Friedrich Brot z, Jürgen Fauser, and Uwe Krüger, Behr GmbH &amp; Co. In order to accurately predict the performance of a cooling mod- ule in an underhood environment, it is essential that the heat fluxes to the air from the various heat exchangers, such as radiator, con- denser and charge air cooler, are modeled properly. Simulation models should therefore involve the prediction of the flow and tem- perature fields in both air and liquid side of heat exchangers. At Behr GmbH &amp; Co., different simulation tools are successfully inte- grated in the development process to meet this goal. For underhood flow simulations, heat exchanger analysis programs are coupled directly with the flow solver. In order to verify the simulation a vali- dation program has been set up based on the fact, that the air mass flow rate through the cooling module has a major influence on the performance of the radiator. Therefore, calculated air mass flow rates through the radiator were compared with the experimentally measured flow rates. The same applies also for the local velocity distribution. For this procedure the radiator was equipped with Micro Probes from Ruijsink and calibrated to measure local air velocities. The experimentally determined air flow characteristics are in good agreement with the results from the CFD underhood analysis for a broad range of operating conditions. 2001-01-1696.

A complete system will be modeled consisting of various subsystems. The subsystems to be discussed include the air- flow through the vehicle, the coolant system, the engine oil system, the automatic transmission fluid system and the engine block. The entire system will be a completed network of the connected and interacting subsystems and will computationally model a vehicle's thermal performance. This paper will discuss in detail a park idle warm-up of a vehicle on a 'hot' day and compare the analytical results to experimentation. 2001-01-1697. Modeling of engine warm-up with integration of vehicle and engine cycle simulation. Christof Samhaber and Andreas Wimmer, Technical University Graz; and Engelbert Loib- ner, AVL List GmbH. The incorporation of a detailed engine process calculation that takes into account thermal behavior of the engine and exhaust sys- tem is essential for a realistic simulation of transient vehicle opera- tion. This is the only possible way to have a precise preliminary cal- culation of fuel consumption and emissions. Therefore, a compre- hensive thermal network of the engine based on the lumped capacity method has been developed. The model allows the computation of component temperatures in steady-state operation as well as in tran- sient engine studies, e.g., investigations of engine warm-up. The model is integrated in a co-simulation environment consisting of a detailed vehicle and engine cycle simulation code. The paper describes the procedure of the co- simulation and presents several examples of warm-up simulations. 2001-01-1699. Progress in the optimized application of simu- lation tools in vehicle air conditioning. B. Taxis -Reischl, S. Mor- genstern, and F. Brotz, BEHR GmbH &amp; Co.; and T. Mersch, Behr Climate Systems. The paper focuses on the usage of simulation tools during the development of vehicle air-conditioning systems. The integration of simulation is explained at every stage of the process. It differentiates at which step the 3-D simulation properties are needed and where the advantages of 1-D tools decide its use. For each demand the most targeting way of calculation has to be chosen, facing properties like precision, hardware needs and especially modeling as well as calculation time along to the tightened development schedule. Examples are given from system layout to detailed optimization. 2001-01-1700. Identification of the numerical model for an automotive application thermostatic expansion valve. Roberto Monforte, Magneti Marelli Climatizzazione. The current A/C system performance prediction codes usually describe the TXV behaviour in terms of SH dependence on the evaporation pressure. The data currently issued by TXV suppliers give the maximum outlet evaporator pressure values at 0°C and 10°C outlet evaporator temperature. The models reported below have been set by treating 4-quadrants sheet data for both parallel and cross-charge type mini-block ther- mostatic expansion valves. The valve, positioned upside-down, was fluxed with air and had its sensible element dropped into a thermostatic bath. 2001-01-1701. Evaluating CFD models of axial fans by com- parisons with phase-averaged experimental data. J. Foss and D. Neal, Michigan State Univ. ; and M. Henner and S. Moreau, Valeo Motors and Actuators. In order to improve the reliability of fan design and the prediction of underhood engine cooling based on CFD, Valeo Motors and Actuators and Michigan State University have teamed up to develop a comprehensive experimental and numerical database. The initial focus has been on the simulations of the isolated fan environment in two different test facilities. To understand the discrepancies observed in the comparisons of integral performances, the first detailed hot wire measurements on the MSU test facility have been collected. The data are split into mean velocity components and RMS fluctuations. The former are successfully compared to three detailed turbulent numerical simulations of the corresponding facilities. 2001-01-1702. Flow visualization study of an HVAC module operated in water. Asad M. Sar dar, Air International US Inc.; Wil- liam K. George, Jr., Chalmers University of Technology; James R. Sonnenmeier, Pennsylvania State University at Erie ; and Scott Woodward, SUNY at Buffalo,. Centrifugal blowers serve as the primary source of airflow and aero-acoustic noise in automotive HVAC modules. Flow field mea- surements inside blowers indicate very complex flow patterns. A detailed flow visualization study was conducted on an actual HVAC fan module operated in water under dynamically similar conditions as those in air with the purpose of studying the complex flow pat- terns in order to improve the aerodynamic performance of the fan/ scroll casing and diffuser components. Fan-scroll/diffuser interac- tion was also studied as function of fan speed. Conventional and special (shear thickening) dye injection flow visualization techniques were used to study the complex 3 -dimen- sional vortical and unsteady flow patterns that occur in typical HVAC fans. A major advantage of the flow visualization technique using shear-thickening dye is its usefulness in high the Reynolds number flows that are typically encountered inside HVAC modules. An additional advantage of this dye injection technique is that it can be used with different colored dyes to show regions of flow mixing and track unsteady flow features. Using water as the medium for model testing, the scaling laws indicated that a 1-to-l scale model was sufficient for the proper application of low speed flow visual- ization techniques. The experimental testing identified both qualitatively and quanti- tatively flow structures possibly responsible for noise augmentation and loss of aerodynamic efficiency. Flow visualization was able to indicate the large-scale flow patterns through the blower. It also clearly showed areas of flow separation (which is the major cause of aerodynamic inefficiency and noise production) and recirculation within the blower housing. 2001-01-1703. Advantages of cooling airflow control devices using by internal combustion engines. Spiridon-Cristian-D. Das- calescu and Laurentiu Dimitriu, "Gh.Asachi" Technical University of lasi. The cooling airflow control devices are news in automotive engi- neering. The authors of this paper have achieved some patents in this field, with car engines application. The purpose was to improve engine performances. In the paper the construction of the cooling airflow control, as they are patented, tests made on some cars and corresponding experimental date are presented. Analyzing the experimental results an improving of combustion process could be observed. The cooling airflow devices are patented in mechanical and electronic form, and a prototype of mechanical device was made. The efficiency of these devices is significant below 5°C envi- ronmental temperature. 2001-01-1704. Intake-valve temperature histories during S.I. engine warm-up. Alex C. Alkidas, General Motors Corporation R&amp;D and Planning. The present study is an experimental investigation on the influ- ence of engine operational parameters on the temperature history of intake valves. During the initial stage of the warm-up process, the temperature history of the intake valve followed an exponential behavior with a time constant that ranged from about 23 to 39 s for the test conditions examined. In contrast, the temperature history of the coolant varied linearly with time suggesting that the net heat input to the coolant is roughly constant during the initial stage of the engine warm-up process. After the initial transient phase that 214</page><page sequence="214">2001-01-1704-2001-01-1713 lasted about one minute, the temperature rise of the intake valve was quasi-steady. During this latter period, the measured intake valve temperature was predicted by the steady-state temperature correla- tion developed in an earlier study. 2001-01-1705. Optimization of vehicle warm-up using simu- lation tools. Roland Marzy , Josef Hager , and Clemens Doppel- bauer, Steyr-Daimler-Puch. A comprehensive simulation method is presented for the optim- ization of vehicle warm-up. Sophisticated one-dimensional simula- tion methods based on network theory are used for flow simulation to limit computation time and guarantee high simulation quality. Partial integration of three dimensional flow simulation methods help to improve accuracy. Simulation sub-models for the engine, the HVAC system, and the passenger cabin are combined to simulate the warm-up process of the vehicle. This functionality is imple- mented in a modern software tool named KULI to support the devel- opment engineer as good as possible. Steady-state and transient sim- ulation are used to optimize the warm-up behavior. 2001-01-1706. Nanofluids for vehicle thermal management. S. U. S. Choi, W. Yu, and J. R. Hull, Ar gonne National Laboratory ; and Z. G. Zhang, and F. E. Lockwood, Valvoline Co. Applying nanotechnology to thermal engineering, ANL has addressed the interesting and timely topic of nanofluids. We have developed methods for producing both oxide and metal nanofluids, studied their thermal conductivity, and obtained promising results: (1) Stable suspensions of nanoparticles can be achieved. (2) Nano- fluids have significantly higher thermal conductivities than their base liquids. (3) Measured thermal conductivities of nanofluids are much greater than predicted. For these reasons, nanofluids show promise for improving the design and performance of vehicle ther- mal management systems. However, critical barriers to further development and application of nanofluid technology are agglomer- ation of nanoparticles and oxidation of metallic nanoparticles. Therefore, methods to prevent particle agglomeration and degrada- tion are required. 2001-01-1707. Heavy-duty truck cooling system design using co-simulation. Clive Hughes, Chad Mitts, Frederic Jacquelin, and Marc Wiseman, Ricardo, Inc. In order to meet the legislated emissions levels, future diesel engines will likely utilize cooled exhaust gas re-circulation (EGR) to reduce emissions. The addition of the EGR cooler to the conven- tional vehicle coolant system creates several challenges. Firstly, the engine cooling system flow and heat rejection requirements both increase as it is likely that some EGR will be required at the rated power condition. This adversely affects packaging and fuel econ- omy. The system design is further complicated by the fact that the peak duty of the EGR cooler occurs at part load, low speed condi- tions, whereas the cooling system is traditionally designed to handle maximum heat duties at the rated power condition of the engine. To address the system design challenges, Ricardo has undertaken an analytical study to evaluate the performance of different cooling system strategies which incorporate EGR coolers. This was achieved by performing a co-simulation using commercially avail- able 1 -dimensional codes. 2001-01-1708. Economical engine cooling system. N. S. Ap, A. Maire, P. Jouanny, and J. C. Le Prigent, Valeo Engine Cooling. The previous study presented during the last VTMS 4 showed the following results, for all engine cooling system and depending on the vehicles: - Cost reduction by - 10 to -15%, - Weight reduction by -15 to - 21%, - Coolant volume reduction by -25% - Fuel con- sumption by -3%, - Thermal comfort improvement. Despite of these good results, most of car manufacturers hesi- tated to use this new concept due to this technological breakthrough of engine cooling system because of expensive durability studies. In this paper the electric fan has been simply suppressed and replaced by the heating blower allowing to cool the engine at idle and at low vehicle speed. By suppressing the electric cooling fan, the advantages of this new economical engine cooling system become: - cost reduction up to - 30%, - weight reduction up to - 30%. 2001-01-1709. A Compact Cooling System (CCS™): The key to meet future demands in heavy truck cooling. Jörg Soldner, Werner Zobel, Michael Ehlers, and Jens Nies, Modine Europe GmbH; and Jonathan Wattelet, Modine Manufacturing Co. To meet future needs for heavy truck cooling, a novel high- performance radial compact cooling system (CCS) was developed. Measurements with a prototype system were conducted in a compo- nent wind tunnel and with truck-installed systems in a climatic vehicular wind tunnel. The CSS is compared to conventional axial and side-by-side systems. In comparison with a conventional axial system, the performance per unit volume of the CCS is 42% higher, the noise level is about 6 dB lower and the power consumption of the radial fan is 70% of the axial fan leading to significant savings in fuel consumption. 2001-01-1710. Evaluation of turbulence statistics from engine fan velocity measurements. Scott C. Morris, Michigan State Univ. The present communication reports on processing and interpret- ing velocity measurements in the wake of a cooling fan. Velocity data are typically phase averaged to create statistics that would be observed in a rotating frame of reference. The difference between any given instantaneous measurement and the phase mean value is often referred to as the fluctuating component of velocity. These deviations can be caused by a variety of mechanisms (blade vibra- tion for example) and do not necessarily represent 'turbulence.' A different approach using an eigen-function decomposition of the data is used on a sample data set to help distinguish between cycle- to-cycle variations and turbulence. 2001-01-1711. Energy simulation of a climatic wind tunnel. V. I. Hanby and E. C. Roberts, Loughborough Univ.; and D. W. Fletcher and D. N. T. Jones, Motor Industry Research Association. The use of climatic wind tunnels is a well-established technique for reducing product development cycle times. Given the wide range of climatic conditions that are demanded, energy costs can be a sig- nificant component of a test run. The paper describes a research project which involved the devel- opment and calibration of a detailed model of the operation of a cli- matic wind tunnel (CWT) and its use in evaluating alternative plant supervisory control strategies, together with possible modifications of plant configuration. 2001-01-1712. CFD simulation of flow and heat transfer in airways. Youming Yuan, Adrian Jackson, and Mark Nelson, Cal- sonic International-Europe. Results are presented from a CFD investigation into louvered, corrugated airway designs, commonly employed in high perfor- mance heat exchangers. CFD simulations are found to agree within 10% of measured test data, and to reliably predict trends and com- parative merits between designs. The advantages of CFD simulation are demonstrated through the provision of localized flow and heat transfer information, which would be difficult and expensive to obtain via conventional mea- surement. This localized data has been used to understand the com- plex mechanisms behind heat exchanger performance. The use of CFD is also demonstrated to offer tangible cost and cycle time bene- fits when used proactively within the design process. 2001-01-1713. Thermal management for the HEV liquid- cooled electric machine. Edward Jih, Kanghua Chen, Thomas Abraham, and Venu Siddapureddy, Ford Motor Co. 215</page><page sequence="215">2001-01-1713-2001-01-1719 The future of the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) is very promis- ing for the automotive industry. In order to take a full advantage of this concept, a better thermal performance of the electric motor is required. In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was first verified through several prototypes testing and then is going to be used to execute a series of design of experiment via simulation. Based on the thermal studies in this paper, the integrated coolant jacket design has a better performance than that of separated one. The thermal performance of the stator with the 3M coating is better than the one with paper liner. In addition, using 3M coating reduces the packaging size of the stator. 2001-01-1714. Effect of soot loading on the thermal charac- teristics of diesel engine oils. F. E. Lockwood and Z. G. Zhang , Valv oline Co.; and S. U. S. Choi and W. Yu, Ar gonne National Lab- oratory. When compared with new oil, used diesel engine oils exhibited thermal conductivity that increases as the concentration of soot increases. The magnitude of the effect depends on the oil composi- tion, and on the size and dispersion of the soot particles. Although soot in engine oil is generally deleterious to engine performance from the standpoint of wear and deposits, no negative effects were observed on the thermal performance of the oil itself; indeed, even slight positive effects are expected for oils that maintain soot in sta- ble dispersion. Therefore, the thermal challenge for engine oils in diesel engines that use exhaust gas recirculation will be to prevent soot deposition on engine surfaces. 2001-01-1715. Validation of methods for rapid design and performance prediction of water pumps. Steve Zoz, Wayne Thelen, Tim Alcenius, and Marc Wiseman , Ricardo, Inc. Tools for the design and evaluation of engine water pumps have been developed. These tools range from textbook calculations to 3-dimensional computational fluid dynamics methods. The choice of the tools or the combination of tools used is usually dependent upon production timelines, rather than technical merit. Therefore, the strengths and weaknesses of each of the tools must be under- stood, and each tool must be validated for its specific purpose, then used appropriately to aid in the design or development of a water pump suitable for production. This study was carried out to evaluate three approaches: a proprietary Ricardo approach based on 1 -dimen- sional analysis and correlations, a 3-dimensional computational fluid dynamics approach, and a conventional prototype manufacture and test iteration approach. The analytical results were correlated to experimentally obtained pressure rise, mass flow rate, and impeller speed data. The methods are compared in terms of their technical accuracy and their abilities to assist in water pump design and devel- opment programs. 2001-01-1716. Impact of US02 and Euro4 emission legislation on powertrain cooling challenges and solutions for heavy-duty trucks. E. Pantow, J. Kern, M. Banzhaf, R. Lutz, and A. Tillmann, Behr GmbH &amp; Co. Step by step US and European legislation are defining more stringent emission limits for diesel engines. Depending on these lim- its for NOx and particulate emissions different emission reduction concepts including or excluding cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) appear over time. Most probable cooled EGR will be the solution for US02 and, in combination with particulate traps, for many Euro4 applications. Competitive aftertreatment solutions like selective catalytic reduction (SCR) may need cooled EGR in addi- tion to meet even tougher emission targets. Therefore cooled EGR can be assumed to be a long-term task. The impacts on the power train cooling system arise from the need of high-performance EGR systems. This results in increased heat rejection from the EGR cooler and increased pressure and tem- perature loads on the charge air cooling system. At the same time overall fuel efficiency is becoming more important giving additional attention on the parasitic losses of the cooling system. The paper presents the solution finding process beginning with maximizing the overall efficiency of the cooling system. So, the increase of the cooling air flow which must be reached with improved fan design and underhood air flow and which is connected with parasitic losses can be limited. The investigations show that conceptional changes are needed to cope with these demands. Hereby, the most suitable cooling concept depends strongly on the truck manufacturers' targets. 2001-01-1717. Instabilities occurring in an automotive A/C loop equipped with an externally controlled compressor and a thermal expansion valve. B. Hamery, J. M. Liu, and C. Riviere, Valeo Climate Control. The new compressor generation, called externally controlled compressors, is able to be electronically driven from zero to its max- imum displacement. The cooling power can be adjusted to the exact need and this way the fuel consumption of the automotive A/C loop can be reduced. Unfortunately, for the mean and low thermal loads on the evaporator, this new opportunity is limited by A/C loop oper- ation instabilities. Thanks to an automatic approach of the coupling TxV - Evapora- tor, we can explain the origin of these instabilities and we can show the involvement of this new compressor generation. Then we propose different improvements such as: - a better account of the automatic parameters of the TxV and the evaporator (gains, time constants). - a TxV setting modification. - a new genera- tion of TxV with a leakage. These solutions are discussed according to their interest. 2001-01-1718. External corrosion resistance of CuproBraze® radiators. Markku S. Ainali, Outokumpu Copper Strip AB; Tapio Korpinen, Outokumpu Copper R&amp;D; and Olof Forsén, Helsinki University of Technology. New technology for the manufacturing of copper/brass heat exchangers has been developed and the first automotive radiators are already in operation in vehicles. This new technology is called CuproBraze®. One of the essential questions raised is the external corrosion resistance with reference to the present soldered copper/ brass radiators and to the brazed aluminum radiators. Based on the results from electrochemical measurements and from four different types of accelerated corrosion tests, the external corrosion resistance of the CuproBraze® radiators is clearly better than that of the soldered copper/brass radiators and competitive with the brazed aluminum radiators, especially as regards marine atmo- sphere. Due to the relatively high strength of the CuproBraze® heat exchangers, down gauging of fins and tubes in some applications is attractive. High-performance coatings can ensure long lifetime from corrosion point of view, even for thin gauge heat exchangers. 2001-01-1719. High-performance climate control for alterna- tive fuel vehicle. Stéphane Bilodeau, Groupe Énerstat Inc. Conventional gasoline-powered automotive heating systems use the abundant coolant waste heat to achieve acceptable comfort. Engine thermal losses in alternative fuel vehicles (ULEVs, HEVs and EVs) are too small to meet the heating load. The mobile heating and air conditioning systems in use today on internal combustion vehicles do not lend themselves to efficient application in the Low Emission Vehicle market. A climate control system (including heating, cooling, ventilating and dehumidifying) has been developed by Groupe Énerstat Inc. The Climate Control System has been designed from the ground up specifically for high efficiencies vehicles and it integrates a high- performance hermetically sealed heat pump and a thermal storage unit. Energy regeneration allows for constant exchange of the cab's air and optimum air quality with efficient defogging and defrosting of windows without serious energy expenditure. Prototypes have been tested in a climate chamber (from -30°C to +30°C) and been installed in a small delivery van converted to electricity. The van has been operated with (and without) the system 216</page><page sequence="216">2001-01-1719-2001-01-1726 for comparison purposes. The testing we have performed indicates that the Climate Control System would operate at a COP of 2.9 under severe driving conditions. The high-performance climate control system is flexible enough to be readily adaptable to the needs of different categories of vehi- cles, such as cars, vans and buses. The system maintains optimum comfort, air quality, humidity control and defogging/defrosting as soon as the vehicle is started, even at temperatures below -20°C which represents a distinct advantage even over conventional ICE vehicles. 2001-01-1720. Comparison of CFD simulation methods and thermal imaging with windscreen defrost pattern. F. Skea, R. D. Harrison, A. J. Baxendale, and D. Fletcher, MIRA . The measured windscreen defrost pattern for a saloon car has been compared with two CFD simulation methods and with the results obtained using a thermal imaging camera. The objectives were to determine: if CFD could be used with confidence to simulate defrost performance; the difference between the two CFD methods; the ability of the thermal imaging technique to predict defrost performance; the most appropriate use of these techniques during an H VAC development program. There was a good comparison between the defrost pattern on the windscreen and the results from the thermal imaging camera and the two CFD methods. The CFD methods have been shown to be suit- able for fault finding and recommending their use is reinforced for development work of ducts and vents in the HVAC system. Airflow direction and distribution could be implied from the thermal camera images, which makes it a suitable tool for fine tuning duct and vent designs at the final stages of the design program. 2001-01-1721. The impact of metal-free solar reflective film on vehicle climate control. John P. Rugh and Robert B. Harring- ton, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; and Jeffrey A. Boett- cher, 3 M Automotive Division. The air-conditioning system can significantly impact the fuel economy and tailpipe emissions of automobiles. If the peak soak temperature of the passenger compartment can be reduced, the air- conditioner compressor can potentially be downsized while main- taining human thermal comfort. Solar reflective film is one way to reduce the peak soak temperature by reducing the solar heat gain into the passenger compartment. A 3M non-metallic solar reflective film (SRF) was tested in two minivans and two sport utility vehicles (SUV). The peak soak temperature was reduced resulting in a quicker cooldown. Using these data, a reduction in air-conditioner size was estimated and the fuel economy and tailpipe emissions were predicted. 2001-01-1722. A numerical simulation strategy for complex automotive cooling systems. Gerald Seider, Fabiano Bet, Thomas Heid, Ulrich Hess, Tobias Klein, and Jürgen Sauer, BMW AG. A simulation strategy has been developed to predict the perfor- mance of an automotive coolant network of high complexity. The method is based on one- and three-dimensional flow and heat trans- fer analysis. A new flow and heat transfer model for the ATF circuit of the automatic transmission is included as well as a one- dimensional flow path model for the underhood flow through the cooling module. The model is applied to different steady state oper- ating conditions of a passenger car for which the heat flux balance for the thermal system is derived and discussed. 2001-01-1723. Model-based analysis of compressor valve leakage and its effects on the efficiency of the motor- compressor. Claudio A. Hernandez , General Motors Corp.; and Alois J. Adams, University of Arkansas. In the development of algorithms to detect and diagnose compo- nent malfunctions impacting system performance and efficiency, engineers are often faced with the following questions: what is the relevant information required, what sensor or set of sensors is needed to provide this information, how should the information from the sensor signals be extracted, which sensor provides the ear- liest signal of system efficiency deterioration, and how do these sig- nals change as the severity of the fault increases? A typical approach used to answer these questions is to experiment empirically with the actual system; however, this approach can be expensive and time consuming because it involves a variety of complex instrumentation and requires a fair amount of time to run the tests and analyze the data. An alternate approach, which is considerably less expensive is to use a model of the system and run computer simulations to get insight and understanding into its behavior. Once the computer model is constructed, simulations of the model can be readily obtained and system response to specific component failure studied. In this paper we show how the key questions related to system performance can be answered through system modeling and simula- tion. The paper shows how a motor-compressor system can be mod- eled to yield insight and understanding into system behavior and the model is used to assess and compare the performance of three tech- niques to detect and diagnose incipient faults of the reciprocating compressor valves. 2001-01-1724. Application of mathematical models to detect and diagnose reciprocating compressor valve leakage. Claudio A. Hernandez, General Motors Corp.; and Alois J. Adams, Univer- sity of Arkansas. This report presents results from the model simulation of the pressure, vibration, and current signatures as derived in the accom- panying publication and compares the simulated data with measured data from an actual laboratory motor-compressor system. The simu- lations from the models were used to determine the information con- tent of the sensor signals, compare the various diagnostic techniques and develop a multisensor approach based on the integration of these techniques to detect and diagnose reciprocating compressor valve leakage. 2001-01-1725. Aging response and elevated temperature strengthening in brazing sheet core alloys of 3xxx series alumi- num. H. Scott Goodrich and Zayna M. Connor, Pechiney Rolled Products; and G. S. Murty, Touchstone Research Laboratory, Ltd. In this study, the age-hardening effect in different braze sheet core alloys with varying levels of Mg was evaluated through tensile tests performed at their respective aging temperatures. The investi- gated temperature range was room temperature to 250°C. As the Mg content of the material increased, the extent of age hardening increased and the gain in yield strength was retained up to a higher temperature. For the material with 0.5 Mg, the yield strength at 175°C following peak aging at 175°C was about 60% greater than the as-brazed yield strength. While the overaging did not occur after 2500 hours of aging at 104°C, the yield strength of material with 0.5 Mg following aging for 1500 hours at 175°C was higher than its as-brazed yield strength. 2001-01-1726. Interactions between the materials in the tube- fin-joints in brazed copper-brass heat exchangers. Leif Tapper and Markku Ainali, Outokumpu Copper Strip AB. The paper describes the interactions between the filler material and the copper fin in the joint in the CuproBraze® process. Due to the influence of the filler metal, part of the copper fin is alloyed. The influence of the time above the melting point of the filler material and of the maximum proces s-temperature were investigated. It was found that the time has the strongest influence. After laboratory tests and production scale tests a brazing window for the process has been established. That can be used to set up brazing cycles for different kind of furnaces. From a number of wind tunnel tests it has been confirmed that when the brazing is done within this window the alloying of the fin is limited that it does not have practical influence on the thermal per- formance of the heat exchanger. 217</page><page sequence="217">2001-01-1727-2001-01-1733 2001-01-1727. A new high-strength aluminum alloy for con- trolled atmosphere brazing. Torkel Stenqvist, Sapa Heat Transfer AB. A new high-strength aluminum alloy intended for tubes in auto- motive radiators has been developed. The material is an age- hardening alloy containing Mg, Si, Cu, and Mn. Titanium is added for corrosion protection. The post-braze strength of the material is dependent on the cool- ing rate after brazing. With l°C/s cooling rate between 400 and 200°C, the Rpo.2 will be about 75 MPa. The corrosion resistance of the material is excellent. It is more noble than standard fin materials and will be protected by sacrificial action. Any attack in the material will be forced into a lamellar mode due to the Ti addition. 2001-01-1728. Parking cooling systems for truck cabins. Hans Kampf and Dieter Schmadl, Behr GmbH &amp; Co. Engine-independent AC systems, or parking cooling systems for non-idling air conditioning are getting more and more important, because extremely uncomfortable conditions during breaks or a dis- proportionate amount of fuel consumption for engine idling during breaks are not longer accepted. For cost, weight and package reasons today only thermal storage systems are ready for series production of in series production. The benefits (comfort and fuel savings) and test results of such a system are shown. Future developments of fuel cells or new alternator/battery sys- tems will probably change this evaluation. 2001-01-1729. Effects of vehicle windshield defrosting and demisting process on passenger comfort. A. Aroussi and A. Has- san , University of Nottingham; and B. S. AbdulNour, Ford Motor Co. This paper describes an investigation into the fluid flow and heat transfer on the windshield as well the effect of the air discharge from the defroster vents on passenger comfort. The investigation is both experimental and computational. Full-scale tests are conducted on a current vehicle model using non-intrusive diagnostic methods. The results presented are from numerical simulations validated by exper- imental measurements. The numerical predictions compare well with the experimental measurements. The locations of maximum velocity and pressure, as well as width and length of re-circulation regions, are correctly predicted. 2001-01-1730. A comparison of the hydraulic performance of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol aqueous solutions as auto- motive coolants. Kaisar Alshamani, Visteon Corp. The present paper presents a theoretical study that enables mak- ing a comparison of the performance of the hydraulic performance of ethylene glycol- and propylene gly col-based aqueous coolants. The analysis establishes equations for calculating and comparing the pressure drop encountered in the flow of coolants in the laminar, transitional and turbulent flow regimes. The study covers a wide range of temperatures. 2001-01-1731. Model development, simulation and valida- tion, of powertrain cooling system for a truck application. Rassem R. Henry , Delphi Research Labs; and James Koo and Clay- ton Richter, Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems. Powertrain cooling control is becoming a topic of increasing interest as evidenced by the recent surge of activities that suppliers of automotive powertrain cooling and HVAC systems are reporting in literature. The goals of these activities are to achieve better fuel economy, lower emissions and increased passenger comfort by con- trolling coolant flow through the different system components. In order to study any of the ideas in this area, a simulation model must be developed to sift through them for the most practical and effec- tive method to avoid the high cost of hardware builds and long test- ing hours. This work uses the EASY5 simulation package (a product of the Boeing Company) to model such systems. A model is devel- oped for a pickup truck application and is validated against test results. At this stage, the model has only the basic components namely the radiator, the water pump, a surge (return) tank, hoses and pipes, and the engine thermal load. Although the model lacks detailed representations of the engine thermal model, the oil circuit, the air dynamics, and the thermostat behavior, simulation results show good agreement with test results and their trends. The model is being expanded to include engine thermal model as well as addi- tional elements such as a thermostat model (both passive and elec- tronically controlled), air dynamics and HV AC/heater details. Elec- tronic controls will be integrated with the model in the near future to study different strategies for fuel economy and emissions improvement. 2001-01-1732. Thermal management evolution and con- trolled coolant flow. David J. Allen and Michael P. Lasecki, Engi- neered Machined Products Inc. A tremendous amount of research has been done on the coolant system of engines, however, the configuration remains virtually the same since the early 1900' s. Recent testing has shown that by con- trolling components such as thermostats and water pumps, effi- ciency and emission improvements can be realized. With the near- ing of higher voltage and hybrid systems, along with the availability of high-efficiency electric pumps and valves, we are fast approach- ing the implementation of controlled coolant flow technology. This paper will discuss the problems with the current cooling systems, some of the work that has been done recently and what an ideal con- trolled coolant system may look like in the future. 2001-01-1733. Optimization elements for externally con- trolled air conditioning systems. Vincent Pommé, Valeo Climate Control. In order to reduce the fuel overconsumption, new air condition- ing systems fitted with externally controlled compressors have been implemented. Their operating principle consists in driving electri- cally (external control) the compressor displacement in order to adjust the cooling capacity delivered by the A/C system to the cool- ing capacity required by the passenger compartment. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the mechanical power absorbed by the com- pressor and by this means, the fuel overconsumption. However, this potential of fuel consumption reduction can be only achieved under the condition that the other components of the A/C system, such as the thermostatic expansion valve (TxV), are well adapted all together in order to fully take advantage of the implementation of such new type of compressors. The paper describes the different possibilities of optimization of the TxV in regard to hunting phenomena. One of these solutions, consisting in the adjustment and in the increase of the valve setting (start opening characteristic) is described. However, it is pointed out that this solution must be considered very carefully, and other parameters such as compressor power consumption and reliability have also to be considered. A selection of a low TxV setting will lead to a too low limitation of the controllable air temperature, and thus will force the HVAC to operate in a partial reheat mode. On the contrary, a high setting will lead the TxV to feed the evaporator with a too high refrigerant flow rate: in this case, a part of the refrig- erant will remain in a liquid phase at the outlet of the evaporator and will be sucked by the compressor. The consequences will be an increase of the mechanical power absorbed by the compressor in both cases, and a risk of a too rapid degradation of the compressor in case of liquid slugging. The solution proposed will consist in selecting an intermediate TxV setting, allowing for both, minimization of the HVAC reheat mode and minimization of liquid refrigerant suction by the compressor. 218</page><page sequence="218">2001-01-1734-2001-01-1742 2001-01-1734. Optimization of vehicle air conditioning sys- tems using transient air conditioning performance analysis. Terry J. Hendricks , National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has devel- oped a transient air conditioning (Á/C) system model using SINDA/ FLUINT analysis software. It captures all the relevant physics of transient A/C system performance, including two-phase flow effects in the evaporator and condenser, system mass effects, air side heat transfer on the condenser/evaporator, vehicle speed effects, temper- ature-dependent properties, and integration with a simplified cabin thermal model. It has demonstrated robust and powerful system design optimization capabilities. Single- variable and multiple- variable design optimizations have been performed and are pres- ented. Various system performance parameters can be optimized, including system COP, cabin cool-down time, and system heat load capacity. This work presents this new transient A/C system analysis and optimization tool and shows some high-level system design conclusions reached to date. The work focuses on R-134a A/C sys- tems, but future efforts will modify the model to investigate the tran- sient performance of alternative refrigerant systems such as carbon dioxide systems. NREL is integrating its transient air conditioning model into NREL' s ADVISOR vehicle system analysis software, with the objective of simultaneously optimizing A/C system designs within the overall vehicle design optimization. 2001-01-1735. Development of a high-strength fin stock alu- minum alloy. J. van der Hoeven and A. Wittebrood, CORUS Research , Development &amp; Technology; A. Bürger , K. Vieregge , and A. Haszler, CORUS Aluminium Walzprodukte GmbH; and S. Hal- ler, CORUS LP. As part of the overall target in the automotive industry to decrease weight and production costs, the heat exchanger market has to develop more effective designs on an on-going basis. In turn, this places demands on the material supplier to develop higher- strength alloys, which enable down-gauging for lighter-weight structures, or the use of high-pressure cycles, and/or an increased amount of fins for increased cooling efficiency. This increased per- formance must be achieved cost effectively and with brazing and corrosion performance equivalent to, or superior to, the existing material. In order to meet these demands Corns Aluminium has developed over the last few years new families of improved alloys for heat exchanger tubes and core plates, that are suitable for Vacuum and/or Controlled Atmosphere Brazing (CAB). To further complete this development a program was started to develop a series of high- strength alloys for the heat exchanger cooling fins. This paper presents an overview of the latest alloy developments at Corns Aluminium in the field of Fin Stock alloys. 2001-01-1736. Development of all-nylon charge air cooler for automotive applications. Alberto Mannoni and Domenico Vitali, Magneti Marelli Climatizzazione S.p.A. The preliminary experimental results of an all-nylon charge air cooler development for automotive application are presented. The results achieved during the project deployment in terms of perfor- mance comparison between metal and nylon Charge air Coolers are reported. Data related to both bench and road tests are presented and discussed. 2001-01-1737. Method for predicting and optimizing the strength of extruded multi- void aluminum heat exchanger tube. Frank F. Kraft, Brazeway, Inc. The mechanical response to internal pressure in extruded multi- void tube is investigated for three profiles using AA1050 alloy. Hydrostatic pressure data and changes in internal tube geometry are used to determine the effective stress in internal tube walls to insta- bility (failure). True stress and strain data for internal walls in the tube are established and a model is proposed to predict the material response and pressure at failure. These data are compared to bulk material data from tensile testing. Differences in material response are attributed to stress state and size effects, and these mechanisms are reviewed. Process-structure-property relationships of extruded aluminum heat exchanger tube are also reviewed for brazed assem- blies in light of the influence on size effects. 2001-01-1738. Comfort management. Andreas Eilemann, Behr America Inc.; and Hans Kampf, Behr GmbH &amp; Co. Contradictory requirements like a quick heat up of the compart- ment versus a quick heat up of the engine (especially in cars with fuel efficient engines) show that there is a need for a highly sophisti- cated climate control system to optimize the operation points. This could be done by a suitable system and a close interaction between the control systems for climate, engine and coolant management. Additionally we can improve the climate control system to a com- fort management system by using sensors for air velocity and humidity. With today's technology we can build up a calculation model to determine a comfort factor for the occupants and use this factor for the climate control instead of only using the compartment temperature as controlled variable. 2001-01-1739. Modeling of human thermal comfort. Rom McGuffin, National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Current vehicle climate control systems are dramatically over- powered because they are designed to condition the cabin air mass in a specified period of time. A more effective and energy-efficient objective is to directly achieve thermal comfort of the passengers. NREL is developing numerical and experimental tools to predict human thermal comfort in non-uniform transient thermal environ- ments. These tools include a finite element model of human thermal physiology, a psychological model that predicts both local and global thermal comfort, and a high spatial resolution sweating ther- mal manikin for testing in actual vehicles. 2001-01-1741. Engine cooling system stability. Edward V. McAssey, Jr. and Amy S. Fleischer, Villanova Univ. Engine cooling systems contain multiple parallel flow paths, which under sub-cooled boiling conditions can experience excursive flow instability. This study presents an analytical model describing the pressure drop in a channel subjected to flow boiling. Using water as the working fluid, results are presented showing the effect of inlet velocity and surface heat flux on the overall pressure drop. The accuracy of this model for water has been verified. The calculations show that for typical engine operating conditions, the cooling pas- sage can contain regions of partially developed and fully developed sub-cooled boiling. 2001-01-1742. Advanced engine cooling thermal manage- ment system on a dual voltage 42Y-14V minivan. Matthieu Chan- freau and Alex Joseph, Valeo Engine Cooling; Darren Butler, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd.; and Richard Światek, Daimler- Chrysler. Today the worldwide convergence towards stricter fuel con- sumption and emission regulations is pushing carmakers and suppli- ers into new fields of innovation. Valeo Engine Cooling, VEC, is contributing towards these goals by applying its thermal manage- ment system expertise in order to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by using an advanced engine cooling system that incorpo- rated variable speed PWM fans, an electric water pump and an elec- tric water control valve. The paper discusses the benefits in terms of engine cooling, fuel economy and emissions over the FTP drive cycle. The paper gives some examples of advanced engine cooling strategies based on a virtual, predictive metal temperature sensor that is used to actuate the electrical water pump at the desired flow rate. The electrical bal- ance between the 42V pump and fans has also been optimized to reduce the vehicle electrical power consumption and to keep the coolant temperature close to 110°C. 219</page><page sequence="219">2001-01-1743-2001-01-1753 2001-01-1743. New, high-efficiency, low-cost liquid heat exchanger for cooling power semiconductor devices. Clifford C. Wright and Lloyd F. Wright , Solid State Cooling Systems . A novel extruded aluminum heat exchanger for cooling power semiconductor devices used in hybrid vehicles is described. The pat- ented and patent-pending design employs an enhanced heat transfer surface and turbulence generating devices to efficiently remove heat from devices, such as IGBTs, and reject it into the vehicles coolant loop. Heat transfer rates approach brazed plate-fin designs while the pressure drop remains low at high coolant flow. 2001-01-1744. Simulating performance of a parallel flow con- denser using hydrocarbons as the working fluids. Gursaran D. Mathur, Valeo Climate Control. Performance of a parallel flow condenser is simulated by using hydrocarbons as the alternative refrigerants. The performance of the condenser is simulated with Propane (R-290), Isobutane (R-600a), and 50/50 mixture (by weight) of Propane and Isobutane. The per- formance is compared to a system with R-134a as the working fluid. For a given condenser heat rejection capacity, the refrigerant mass flow rates for hydrocarbon refrigerants are significantly lower than R-134a. However, the heat transfer coefficients are comparable in magnitudes to the base case (R-134a) which results in heat transfer rates that are very close to that of the base case. Hence, the simulated rate of heat transfer for hydrocarbon refrigerants is very close (within ±3%) to that of R- 134a system. The pressure drop for hydro- carbon refrigerants are significantly lower in comparison to R-134a. The simulated thermal performance has been compared with the experimental test data obtained from the system bench. The simu- lated performance is within ±9% of the experimental data. Thermal and hydrodynamic performance data along with design consider- ations have been presented in this paper. 2001-01-1745. Practical study of automotive HVAC integra- tion into cockpit modules. Richard Hoyle, Air International (US) Inc. The development of highly integrated cockpit modules has been identified by many of the OEM's and Tier 1 suppliers to be an imperative technology in the constant effort to, reduce cost, reduce mass, reduce complexity, increase quality and improve recyclability over traditional instrument panels. A natural progression of this con- cept is the integration of automotive HVAC systems into these cock- pit modules. This paper implements a practical study of HVAC implementation into cockpit modules and analyzes the effect on the perceived benefits of Integration. 2001-01-1746. Experimental study of automotive heat shield geometry with natural convection and radiation boundary con- ditions. Craig M. Cless and Scott P. Dudley , Ford Motor Co. Shielding a vehicle underbody is becoming a daunting task with increased exhaust temperatures due to emissions regulations and ever-increasing packaging constraints, which place components ever closer to exhaust systems. This experimental study was initi- ated to evaluate the two-dimensional thermal effects of heat shield flange height and shield width in vehicle underbody idle conditions. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a function to optimize the shape of heat shielding to achieve a specified floorpan tempera- ture during vehicle idle conditions. 2001-01-1747. Use of simulation tools in EGR development process. Jens Nies and Andreas Stolz , Modine Europe GmbH. During the development process of the EGR, several CAE tools were used. The overall load results as a combination of static, dynamical and temperature induced load. The inputs were known from experiments and engine test stand. The influence of different gasket assembly possibilities onto the pre-stress in the structure was subject to several static analysis. The dynamic behavior was addressed because of the engine-induced random vibrations into the EGR system. Natural frequencies and modes were used to show potential for improvements and power spectral density analysis was used the evaluate the statistical stress distribution. Fluid distribution and structure temperature was obtained from CFD analysis with conjugate heat transfer. 2001-01-1748. Development of EGR coolers for truck and passenger car application. Andreas Stolz , Katja Fleischer , Wolf- gang Knecht, Jens Nies, and Roland Strähle, Modine Europe GmbH. The new European legislation (EURO III) for emission reduction was mainly reached by combustion optimization. This lead to a higher fuel consumption, which can be compensated by cooled EGR. One of the described coolers is the first known EGR cooler for series truck application in Europe and is in production since mid of year 2000. Also for the next legislation step (EURO IV) cooled EGR is one of the most promising solutions. The design criteria and production issues of a tube- and shell-type EGR cooler for truck application and a tube plate design for a high- volume production cooler for passenger car will be described. 2001-01-1749. Engine cooling multi-exchanger. Stephane Ave- quin, M. Potier, C. Mahe, G. Gille, and C. Martins, VALEO Engine Cooling. European automotive engineers are continuously looking for space reduction in the front end of new vehicles. Consequently, some automotive suppliers tried to provide more and more compact Engine Cooling Modules. Most of the time, the packaging of the heat exchangers, as optimized as it can be, remains a strong limit to a significant decrease of the module thickness. This study proposes a new module concept, where heat exchang- ers are physically bound, and subsequently combined in a single part. On this basis, the following benefits are obtained: - Packaging reduction of -30% - Weight reduction from 5 to 10% - Thermal per- formances improvements To sustain this purpose, new modules combining engine-cooling radiators and A/C loop condensers have been designed and engi- neered in different core technologies. Those components have been bench tested (plenum to plenum) in comparison to its stand-alone equivalent heat exchanger. Furthermore, a small European car with 1.6-liter 1 10 hp gasoline engine, equipped with such 'Multi-exchanger' has been evaluated in a climatic wind tunnel, according to: - Engine-cooling specifica- tions - Climate control specifications The obtained results will be outlined as followed: - Design and packaging benefit - Thermal bench testing - Wind tunnel tests - Weight and cost opportunities 2001-01-1752.

Rice, Visteon Automotive Systems. The analysis of airflow in an automotive HVAC cowl box is complicated by the cross-sectional variations and abrupt changes in airflow direction. In this study, the complex three-dimensional tur- bulent flow found in a generic road vehicle cowl box is investigated experimentally and computationally. An optical anemometer is used to acquire the experimental data within a white metal sheet of a cowl box. The results are then used to validate and tune a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical cowl model. 2001-01-1753. Laser welding of EGR coolers - A new process technology for heat exchanger manufacturing. B. Grünenwald, S. Felber, A. Schmitz , and M. Hettig, Behr GmbH &amp; Co. Laser welding is a joining process, which is comparatively new to industrial production and especially to heat exchanger manufac- turing. Due to the high energy density of the laser beam, the process is characterized by faster welding speeds with deep penetration as compared to the conventional welding processes. Therefore laser- 220</page><page sequence="220">2001-01-1753-2001-01-1759 welding technology is widely used in the automotive industry on a variety of different applications. This paper describes the application of laser welding as possible joining technology for exhaust gas heat exchangers made of stain- less steel. The cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technology shows good potential for meeting the actual and future emission tar- gets of diesel engines combined with acceptable fuel consumption. It will be shown that the selection of the base metal and the joining technology are extremely important for the durability of the product because of the severe operating environment the EGR cooler must endure. The consecutive manufacturing steps starting with the block assembly, the welding of the tubes to the header as well as the com- bined header to shell welding and cutting process will be described. In addition some typical laser welding results for the different pro- cessing steps will be shown. An important factor for the technical and economical success of laser welding of EGR coolers is given by the used systems engineering. As an example the application of a new kind of focusing optics for the tube-to-header welding process will be introduced. Based on the experience of the serial production of EGR coolers for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, the importance of laser welding as joining technology for other types of heat exchangers will be evaluated. 2001-01-1754. Electrochemical tests with copper/brass radia- tor tube materials in coolants. Tapio Korpinen, Outokumpu Cop- per Partner AB. Corrosion behavior of brass CuZnl5Fe, brass CuZn30 and alu- minum in automotive coolants was studied with electrochemical methods. Two commercial glycols were used in the study. The tests indicate that both glycols provide the metals tested with good corrosion protection. Glycol with conventional inhibitor chem- icals prevents corrosion of aluminum even with extensive anodic polarization. Although initiation of pitting could be observed in the same conditions with an inhibitor system based on organic acid technology, it is not very likely to have galvanic corrosion on alumi- num by dissolved and deposited copper in automotive coolant systems. 2001-01-1755. CFD optimization of an EGR cooler for heavy- duty diesel engines. Lucien Charnay, Hans-Erik Angstrom , Lena Andersson , and Björn Palm , Royal Institute of Technology (KTH); and Lars Östling, VALEO Engine Cooling. The gas flow and heat transfer in an EGR cooler has been studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics method (CFD). The shell-and- tube cooler is intended for heavy-duty diesel engines EGR cooling applications. The influence of the diffuser shape has been studied with regards to pressure drop, flow distribution across the tube bundle, and heat transfer. Inlet temperature is 250°C, and flows varies from 100 up to 200 g/s. These results were compared to experimental measure- ments. The influence of the bundle size and design has also been investi- gated for two designs. A single tube cooler test bench has also been developed to vali- date the CFD flow and heat transfer models. In flow temperature measurements are provided. The bigger tube bundle has advantages both in terms of pressure drop and even flow distribution. The mean outlet gas temperature is also decreased by 6% in this case. The design of the diffuser has important consequences on flow distribution and pressure drop. A smooth 'trumpet' form helps obtaining good results in terms of pressure drop compared to rougher design. However, this is obtained at the price of a less even flow distribution, which impairs the heat transfer potential. 2001-01-1756. Thermal flow study on the integrated all- aluminum radiator and condenser. Jong Pil Won and Kyu Hyun Lee , Korea Automotive Technology Institute( KATECH). Modular component design and development is a general trend in automotive industry to reduce size and weight, parts and cost, and to protect the environment. As part of the work to achieve these tar- gets an experimental and analytical investigation on the integrated all aluminum radiator and condenser, which was brazed, has been carried out in the view point of thermal flow phenomena. In the study, the thermal flow phenomena of integrated all aluminum radi- ator and condenser was examined in combination of wind tunnel and calorimeter testing for full-scale prototype model and analytical modeling based on a finite difference procedure for solving the ther- mal performance describing flow, pressure drop, and heat transfer. The integrated all-aluminum radiator and condenser proto was designed in cross-flow construction with dual tank and single inte- gral multi-louvered fin. The measured data obtained from wind tun- nel and calorimeter are compared with the predicted results from the analytical model and good agreement with the data is observed. 2001-01-1757. Development of a computer-aided engineering tool for automotive heater system design and its applications. Daniel Huang, Huey Hu, and Chris Wojdyła, Visteon Corp. A Computer- Aided Engineering (CAE) model has been devel- oped to simulate vehicle heater system performance during standard wind tunnel tests and more complicated city traffic cycle tests. This CAE model is continuously enhanced and expanded to account for more up-to-date technologies, such as auxiliary heater system, sup- plemental heat strategies, and supplemental water pump. The objectives of this paper is to describe a CAE tool which is capable of predicting the vehicle average interior air temperature, average discharge air temperature, and heater core coolant inlet tem- perature. The results of several applications will be shown. 2001-01-1758. Automatic control of electronic actuators for an optimized engine cooling thermal management. Alexandre Choukroun and Matthieu Chanfreau, Valeo Engine Cooling. The main objectives of new technologies for internal-combustion engine are lower consumption, pollutant reduction and comfort pas- senger increase. To reach these objectives, we have adopted for engine thermal management two strategies: quicker rise temperature during the cold start and higher engine temperature for part load. To satisfy these criteria, we have modified the classic cooling loop. An electric water pump, an electric water valve and variable speed fan system are the new actuators automatically controlled by electronic calculator. This concept allows to obtain a warm-up time reduced by 50% and 2 to 3% fuel economy on the European cycle. 2001-01-1759. Feasibility of intelligent control strategies to reduce cooling system size. C. A. V. Hughes and M. W. Wiseman, Ricardo Inc. As specific engine power output increases so does the heat rejected to the coolant. The resulting need to increase radiator size is counter-productive due to the lack of package space, and a strong desire to reduce, not increase, vehicle drag. Current tendency is to size the radiator to reject sufficient heat at extreme operating condi- tions (full engine power, high ambient). However, this 'oversized' cooling system may only be needed by a small number of vehicles. A better approach could be to size the radiator for the majority, but not all, operational conditions and manage the coolant temperature by actively controlling coolant flow and engine output. This will need to be done without compromising durability or driveability. This approach sounds highly beneficial in principle, but how sound would it be in practice? The authors have investigated the feasibility of active control by considering the details of radiator performance and engine heat rejection. A simulation model representing a minivan-type vehicle has been created. This model is capable of analyzing the effect of active control on coolant temperature under 221</page><page sequence="221">2001-01-1759-2001-01-1764 different vehicle operating conditions. The paper shows that there is indeed merit in deploying active control of the cooling system. 2001-01-1760. Fuel economy improvements through improved automatic transmission warmup - Stand-alone oil to air (OTA) transmission cooling strategy with thermostatic cold flow bypass valve. Ronald R. Semel , Visteon Corp. The stand-alone oil to air (OTA) transmission cooling strategy with thermostatic cold flow bypass valve has been shown to be an effective means of improving the warmup of an automatic transmis- sion. Improving the system warmup rate of an automatic transmis- sion significantly improves its efficiency by reducing losses result- ing from extremely viscous transmission fluid and can allow for cal- ibration changes that improve overall transmission performance. Improved transmission efficiency in turn allows for improved engine efficiency and performance. The improvements obtained from increased transmission and engine efficiency result in an over- all increase in vehicle fuel economy. Fuel economy and consumption are important parameters con- sidered by the vehicle manufacturer and the customer. Fuel econ- omy can be considered as important as reliability and durability. The stand-alone OTA transmission cooling strategy with thermostatic cold flow bypass valve results in improvements to reliability, dura- bility and fuel economy. Durability and reliability are improved due to improved transmission cooling during hot ambient conditions and improved transmission warmup during cold ambient conditions. Fuel economy is improved through using the stand alone OTA strat- egy due to the improved transmission warmup times, which results in improved powertrain efficiency and less fuel consumption. The thermostatic cold flow bypass valve is the key to the stand alone OTA strategy being able to improve transmission warmup and improve fuel economy. The thermostatic cold flow bypass valve shuts off flow to the transmission oil cooler until a predetermined fluid temperature has been achieved. Once the predetermined trans- mission fluid temperature has been achieved, the bypass valve allows oil flow to the transmission oil cooler. This keeps the trans- mission from being unnecessarily cooled and therefore improves transmission efficiency. As a follow up to previous testing conducted that quantified transmission warmup rates, fuel consumption measurements were taken for a 4X4 sport utility vehicle (SUV). The fuel consumed by the vehicle when using the stand-alone OTA transmission cooling system with thermostatic cold flow bypass valve was compared to the fuel consumed by the vehicle when using the conventional oil to water (OTW) production transmission cooling system. Testing was conducted under a variety of ambient conditions ranging from 25°C to -20°C and for the following operating conditions: 50 kph and 100 kph road load operating conditions at 3250 kg GVW; 50kph and 80 kph 8% grade trailer tow operating conditions at 4500 kg GCW. Vehicle testing was conducted in an environmentally con- trolled wind tunnel with data acquisition occurring twice per second. Data measured included; fuel consumption, transmission system temperature and engine speed. Fuel economy improvements were quantified for each operating condition and the entire drive cycle for a given ambient temperature. The decrease in fuel consumption for the stand alone OTA system is related to the improvements achieved in transmission warmup. The stand-alone OTA transmission cooling strategy allows for improved transmission system warmup and more efficient transmis- sion operation than the conventional OTW transmission cooling strategy. The result was a 4 % improvement in vehicle fuel economy. If changes are made to the vehicle transmission calibration strategy, even greater fuel economy improvements can be obtained. 2001-01-1761.

Joachim Currle and Oliver Moos , DaimlerChrysler AG. In the present study, the exterior air flow over convertibles together with the interior flow in the passenger compartment has been calculated using the commercial CFD program STAR-CD. The investigations have been performed for a SLK-class Mercedes with two occupants. The computational mesh consists of about 3 million hexahedra cells. The detailed informations of the calculated flow field have been used to elaborate the characteristic flow phenomena and increase the physical understanding of the flow. The influence of different geo- metrical modifications (variations of roof spoiler, variations of the draft stop behind the seats etc.) on the flow field and the air draft experienced by the occupants has been analyzed. To proof the accuracy of the numerical results, wind tunnel experiments in a full-scale and l:5-scale wind tunnel have been car- ried out for the basic car model as well as for several geometrical variations. Detailed comparisons of the measuring and computa- tional results showed an acceptable agreement of absolute velocity values as well as trends of the geometrical variations. 2001-01-1763. Brazeability of aluminum alloys containing magnesium by CAB process using cesium flux. J. Garcia, C. Massoulier, and Ph. Faille, Valeo Engine Cooling. The increasing durability requirements for aluminum heat exchangers involve the use of higher levels of magnesium in the core material in order to increase the strength of its components. The challenge is to braze these aluminum alloys by the preferred CAB process. During the CAB process magnesium diffuses out, forming a Magnesium Oxide and Magnesium Fluorides and the use of conven- tional flux becomes ineffective for disrupting it. When wetting occurs, the brazed joint is discontinuous and the presence of leaks becomes more probable. It was found that using a modified aluminum flux that includes some cesium in its composition for aluminum controlled atmo- sphere-brazing process, it is possible to obtain strong brazed joints on the heat exchangers. Additionally, the inclusion of cesium in the flux makes possible to braze aluminum alloys with higher levels of magnesium providing stronger and more durable heat exchangers assemblies. In this work, it was tested the cesium flux on plate to plate speci- mens, on mock-ups in our CAB laboratory furnace, and in complete heat exchangers in the standard production line. The results and future work with cesium flux are presented. 2001-01-1764. Methods for minimizing or eliminating waste- water from flux slurries in non-corrosive flux brazing. D. C. Lauzon, Solvay Fluorides, Inc. ; and H. W. Swidersky, Solvay Fluor und Derivate GmbH. In aluminum heat exchanger production, a non-corrosive flux is applied to individual parts or to assembled units most commonly as an aqueous flux suspension by flooding, spraying or dipping. Waste- water from cleaning the fluxing apparatus and waste flux slurries are often simply diluted and discharged to the environment or treated for fluorides. This paper presents a method for eliminating waste- water from such operations by re-cycling and reusing the waste- water to make up new flux slurries or to top up existing slurries. Results of flux slurry filtration tests will also be presented.

Thermal performance prediction of front-end heat-exchange modules. M. R. Jones and D. W. Fletcher , Motor Industry Research Association. The application of high-performance engines and climate control systems, coupled with constraints relating to vehicle styling, aerody- namics and underbonnet packaging, continues to present demanding thermal management challenges in the design and layout of the front-end cooling module. Several computational fluid dynamics techniques are now available to assist in this design and packaging process, but many of these require a high level of specialization from the user. The work reported here outlines a relatively simple 1 -dimensional technique to aid in the analysis and optimization of the cooling pack configuration. The tool can be used interactively by a multi-skilled vehicle engineer throughout the entire design and development of a new vehicle. 2001-01-1767.

The current activities to develop new cooling systems with more control options are one of the next steps towards better fuel economy and higher comfort. To realize these systems components with enhanced controllability must be developed. The paper will address the component requirements deduced from the system demands and discuss alternative solutions to design these future components. 2001-01-1768. Critical heat flux and boiling heat transfer to water in a 3-mm-diameter horizontal tube. Wenhua Yu, Martin W. Wambsganss, and John R. Hull, Ar gonne National Laboratory; and David M. France, University of Illinois. Boiling of the coolant in an engine, by design or by circum- stance, is limited by the critical heat flux phenomenon. As a first step in providing relevant engine design information, this study experimentally addressed both rate of boiling heat transfer and con- ditions at the critical point of water in a horizontal tube of 2.98-mm inside diameter and 0.9144-m heated length. Experiments were per- formed at a system pressure of 203 kPa, mass fluxes of 50-200 kg/m2s, and inlet temperatures from ambient to 80°C.

Axial-flow cooling fan design has traditionally been a difficult and time-consuming enterprise, especially when elements like blade sweep (or skew) are incorporated for noise-reduction purposes. Computational fluid dynamics, or CFD, has been implemented with some success, but still requires a great deal of engineering effort and computer resources. To address the limitations of conventional Navier-Stokes CFD simulation in the fan-design process, a new computer program has been developed. The program is a three- dimensional airflow prediction tool that applies the underlying prin- ciples of CFD without the difficulties of complex model develop- ment and slow turn-around. In addition to the analysis function, the program includes a straightforward iterative design feature. In design mode, the user enters the volumetric flow rate, pressure rise, and rotating speed at the operating point, and the program converges to a solution by adjusting blade geometric parameters such as setting angle and camber. 2001-01-1770. Coupling of one-dimensional and three- dimensional simulation models. Daniel J. Grose and Keith Austin, Flowmaster International Ltd. A software tool has been developed that allows one-dimensional and three-dimensional fluid flow simulation packages to interact in a heterogeneous (UNIX -NT/2000/98) environment. This allows for the implementation of a 'co-simulation' methodology in which the internal flow in a component simulated in three dimensions is incor- porated into a network containing components represented by bulked loss coefficients in a one dimensional analysis. This method- ology enables the details of the internal flow to be retained whilst conserving overall mass flow in the network, thus eliminating uncertainties in boundary values prescribed in the three-dimensional model and reducing the overall simulation time. 2001-01-1780. From development to industrialization of an IAPAC® marine outboard D.I. 2-stroke engine. Stéphane Venturi, Jacques Lavy, and Pierre Duret, IFP; and Maurizio Selva, and Giorgio Tonta , SELVA Marine. The IAPAC® Direct fuel Injection (DI) system, developed by IFP, has already well proven its capability to reduce pollutants emis- sions and fuel consumption of 2-stroke engines for both 2-wheeler and marine outboard application. This crankcase Compressed Air Assisted Fuel Injection process allowing the introduction of the fuel separately from the scavenging air, minimizes the fuel short- circuiting and has shown its potential on various prototype demon- strators. This paper presents the development and pre-industrialization work performed to apply this concept to an SELVA Marine 2-cy lin- der 50 HP outboard 2-stroke engine. A standard carbureted engine has been converted to a IAPAC® prototype engine by mainly modi- fying the cylinder head. Then, this prototype engine has been cali- brated, tested and optimized on the dyno test bench to comply with future emissions regulation while keeping similar power output than the reference carbureted engine. Transient operations, partially investigated on the dyno test bench, have been refined during the boat testing campaign. After this feasibility assessment study which has demonstrated more than 30% reduction in fuel consumption and the capability to comply with both IMEC Stage 2 and EPA 2006 emission regula- tions with sufficient margin, the pre-industrialization phase has been engaged by taking into account a better integration of the specific IAPAC® components. Final results of this IAPAC® pre-industrial D.I. 2-stroke engine are presented and also compared to its other engine counterpart tech- nology showing its adequate application to face future stringent emissions regulations and environmental constraints while keeping its intrinsic advantages in terms of compactness, light weight and specific power. 2001-01-1781. Development of the Aprilia DITECH 50 engine. Mike Ambler and Antonio Zocchi, Aprilia S.p.A. A good scooter engine needs the following characteristics: -sim- plicity and low weight; - high specific power; - great fuel consump- tion; - reliability. Those characteristics are in line (mostly) with the specification of a modern two- stroke engine. However, the non-stop upward spi- ral of anti-pollution laws has imposed new limits to scooter engines. Three immediate solutions are capable of operating in today's legislative environment: High-speed four-stroke engine (with or without catalyst/ secondary air injection); Two-stroke catalyzed engine (with or without secondary air injection); Two- stroke engine with direct injection (the most revolutionary solution). Aprilia has decided to follow the third way by presenting DIT- ECH, a new perspective in the motorcycling world. Obviously, as pioneer of this technology on small, high-speed engines, Aprilia has spent a great deal of time and money to solve the 'application '-related problems of the DITECH system, problems not previously encountered. The biggest design and /or development challenges during the engine's industrialization have been: 223</page><page sequence="223">2001-01-1764-2001-01-1786 Air Fuel Rail: head and combustion chamber planning, spark plug positioning; Lubricant distribution; High altitude operation; Plug fouling under extreme ambient conditions. This project has taken Aprilia through the creation of a totally new engine, with unique characteristics. With DITECH, a tremen- dous reduction of oil an fuel consumption and very low emission of exhaust smoke has been possible, without sacrificing Top end' performance and great mid range torque of a classic two stroke engine. The potential of this new engine technology is very high, due to the relatively simple emissions package required to meet coming anti-pollution laws. 2001-01-1782. Development of a direct injection two-stroke engine for scooters. L. Arnone, M. Janeck, and M. Marcacci, Piag- gio &amp; C.; R. Kirchberger, technical University of Graz; and M. Pon- toppidan, and R. Busi , Magneti Marelli Powertrain Systems. The new European legislation on two-wheeler pollutant emis- sions has forced two- stroke engine manufacturers to study the direct fuel injection (DI) technology. The Piaggio 'ET2 Injection' was the first DI engine in production, using the FAST system (Fully Atom- ized Stratified Turbulence) applied on a 50 cm3 engine. Within the framework of the DOLCE project (Development Of innovative Low pollutant, noise and fuel Consumption two-stroke spark ignition Engines for future vehicles for individual urban mobility) coordinated by Piaggio and supported by the European Commission, a 125 cm3 direct injection 2-stroke engine was devel- oped. This paper presents the engine-related part of this work, which was concluded in March 2000. The engine is equipped with the FAST system and the fuel metering is performed by means of a low- pressure electronic fuel injection system integrated in an Engine Management System (EMS) specially developed for this type of application. Preliminary thermodynamic calculations were made for both one-dimensional as well as three-dimensional flow behavior. The layouts of the gas exchange parts (air cleaner, throttle body, reed valve, scavenge ports, exhaust ports and exhaust system) as well as the combustion system (combustion chamber, injector, spark plug) were optimized. After a fine tuning of the EMS, the roller bench measured results produced values lower than those required by the future Euro 2 emission limits. The performed road tests confirmed a good drivea- bility and a very flexible vehicle behavior in transient operation. 2001-01-1783. Comparative study of the capability of mix- ture- and liquid-based GDI configurations to optimize a lean- stratified SI combustion in a two-stroke, small displacement engine. M. Pontoppidan, Magneti Marelli Power Train Systems; L. Arnone and M . Marcacci, Piaggio &amp; C.; and A. Demaio, NuMIDIA. The first part of the paper gives an overview of the environmental conditions with which a future two- stroke engine must comply. The reasons for which a direct gasoline injection into the combustion chamber offers one of the most promising solutions are explained. In order to understand the potential of different GDI-layouts to produce very lean stratified combustion behavior two different approaches are studied in detail. The latest version of the fuel/air mixture injection used by the F. A. S. T. engine is confronted with a basically liquid high-pressure layout, similar to the design used in automotive four-stroke passenger car engines. A description is given of the basic fluid dynamics of the 50 cc engine used for the study as well as of the experimental and numeri- cal tools applied. The paper concludes with a detailed presentation of the obtained results as well as of the arguments retained to pro- duce the final rating. 2001-01-1784. Euro II calibration of direct injection SCIP™ technology on 50 cc two-stroke two-wheelers. Bertrand Lecointe, Jacques Lavy, and Pierre Duret, IFP; and Hector Sindano, and Angus Watson, SAGEM UK. The relative contribution of two wheelers to local atmosphere pollution is increasing more and more due to ultra-low emissions regulations applied to other vehicle such as cars. In 1999, the first European emissions regulations for 50 cc mopeds and scooters appeared (Euro I) and will also become more and more severe by the time. Euro II (2002) level will correspond to the next step. IFP has developed a simplified Direct Injection technology, named SCIP™, derived from the well known IAPAC® technology without the need of additional camshaft. This technology has been integrated with the MC500 Engine Management System developed by SAGEM for the growing 2-wheelers application. The final sim- ple and cheap product is therefore well adapted to small displace- ment 2-stroke engines as 50 cc engine for 2-wheelers application. This paper presents the development of a 50 cc scooter engine using SCIP™ technology and the calibration of the MC500 System to achieve Euro II regulation. The very low emissions level required for Euro II is achieved by combining SCIP with a small oxidation catalyst converter, although there is no need for Euro I. Achieved results are a reduction in CO reaching 70% below Euro II level, more than 30% margin on HC + NOx level and a fuel consumption close to 2 liters/1 00km (25 to 40% improvement compared to con- ventional carbureted 50 cc 2-stroke mopeds). Compared to its 4-stroke counterpart technology (which will also become more and more sophisticated to meet future stringent emis- sions regulations), the Direct Injection 2-stroke technology is there- fore an efficient and cost-effective way of meeting future European regulations while keeping the 2-stroke engine intrinsic advantages of simplicity, compactness and high specific power. 2001-01-1785. Numerical and experimental study of direct injection for cbarge stratification in a 200 CC two-stroke motor- cycle engine. R. Gentili, S. Zanforlin, S. Frigo, and F. Cozzolino, Università di Pisa ; and P. Dell'Orto , Dell'Orto S.p.A. This paper shows a numerical and experimental study concerning liquid high-pressure direct injection with charge stratification in a 200 cm 3 two-stroke motorcycle engine. Numerical predictions have been performed using KIVA-3v code with different combustion-chamber shapes and spray charac- teristics. Experimental outcomes have substantially confirmed the predic- tions of computation and proved that injector characteristics are of the utmost importance to achieve satisfactory results. 2001-01-1786. Development of the high pressure direct injec- tion (HPDI) system for two-stroke outboard motor. Masafumi Sogawa and Masahiko Kato, Sanshin Industries Co. Two-stroke internal combustion engine, characterized by light- weight and high output power, is suitable for outboard motors with larger horsepower. The High Pressure Direct Injection (HPDI) sys- tem was developed and applied to this type of production outboard motor. The HPDI system has different arrangement from the con- ventional Orbital or FICHT system. The outboard motor equipped with the system reduces the exhaust emission level to approximately two-thirds of the EPA (U.S.) 2006 emission standard. The HPDI is non-air-assist-type gasoline direct injection system, in which the fuel pressure is raised to 5MPa (700psi) by crankshaft- driven high-pressure fuel pump and then injected directly into the cylinder without air assistance. Research and development for the relevant areas including com- bustion chamber configuration and injector orientation have resulted in successful homogeneous combustion utilizing the scavenging flow of the two-stroke engines. High-pressure injection of the HPDI system effectively reduces exhaust emission especially in higher engine speeds, and at the same time it substantially improves the fuel economy. 224</page><page sequence="224">2001-01-1786-2001-01-1793 This HPDI system design had been released publicly in Japan at the end of 1999. 2001-01-1787. Superiority of newly developed direct- injection engine over conventional engine for personal water- craft. Yoji Fukami, Satoru Watabe, Yoichi Jinja, Yoshimoto Mat- suda, Keiji Takahashi, and Tadayo Nöda , Kawasaki Heavy Indus- tries , Ltd. A new engine of which the fuel is injected directly into the cylin- der has been developed as an environmental-friendly engine for per- sonal watercraft(PWC). This new engine surpasses the conventional carbureted engine in performance, yet achieves 75% reduction of THC+NOx emission and 30% improvement of fuel consumption in the ICOMIA mode. This paper describes the system characteristics of this newly developed DI engine, with reference to its combustion and exhaust gas emission properties. This newly developed engine employs a fuel injection system that injects the fuel directly into the cylinder without a high-pressure fuel pump. To analyze the reliabil- ity of its unique fuel injection system, the cyclic injection rate is measured the Bosch method. The result is that the fuel injection vol- ume per cycle fluctuates very little even under such extreme condi- tions as a condition of highly repetitive high injection volume equiv- alent to an engine running at 7000 rpm with wide-open throttle (WOT). To clarify the difference between stratified charge combus- tion, which is a definitive property of this DI engine, and homoge- neous charge combustion in a carbureted engine, these engines are compared by measuring in-cylinder pressure and analyzing combus- tion in the ICOMIA mode. The result reveals that, compared with combustions in a carbureted engine, stratified charge combustion maintains higher combustion stability by reducing fluctuations of the indicated mean effective pressure per cycle, even when operated under partial loads, including idling. A comparison of exhaust gas emissions by the DI engine and the conventional carbureted engine reveals that the DI engine is clearly superior as the benefit of its sta- ble fuel injection and stratified charge combustion. 2001-01-1788. Investigation of intake port fuel films in a small utility air-cooled engine. F. A. Jehlik and J. B. Ghandhi, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Four techniques were investigated for the characterization and quantification of fuel films in the intake port in a small four-stroke, air-cooled utility engine modified to use a fuel injector mounted in the place of the carburetor float bowl: step-fueling with constant air flow, step-throttle with constant fuel flow, skip-injection, and stop- injection tests. In the first two tests, the exhaust air-fuel (A/F) ratio was measured with a fast-response universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor, while a fast flame ionization detector (FFID) was used in the latter two test methods. The engine was fueled with indo- lene, iso-octane, and propane to investigate and separate combustion and oil absorption/desorption from fuel film effects. The results indicate that the air flow through the intake port had the largest impact on the fuel film dynamics. Step-fueling tests showed only a short (less than 5 engine cycles) period during which the inducted A/F differed from the delivered A/F, whereas step-throttle tests showed a more pronounced A/F excursion that persisted for close to 20 engine cycles. The skip- and stop-injection tests indicated that vaporization from the fuel film contributed approximately 30% of the fuel inducted per cycle, regardless of load or the liquid fuel type. The overall film mass was found to be directly proportional to engine load (throttle position). 2001-01-1790. Development of a non-intrusive method for the diagnosis of the combustion system of a small direct injection diesel engine. F. Cruz Peragón, Universidad de Jaén ; E. Carvajal Trujillo and J. Cantandor Barco , Universidad de Sevilla ; Alejandro Castilla, DEUTZ-DITER, S.A.; and F. Jiménez Espadafor, A. Muñoz Blanco, and Tomás Sánchez Lencero, Universidad de Sevi- lla. Before an engine leaves the manufacturing and/or assembly plant it must undergo different tests in order to control the quality of the engine. These tests are time consuming and also need a specialist worker who can identify anomalies in the engine, mainly through a very well-trained 'ear.' This paper shows the development and the application of a meth- odology which can be able to diminish the running-in period and to identify malfunctions related to the combustion process in a plant for the manufacturing of direct injection diesel engine. The method is based on the formulation of two submodels included in a model of the dynamic of the engine, where the crank- shaft is assumed as rigid body. One of the submodels relates the instantaneous mechanical losses of the engine with design and operating parameters. The other sub- model defines the burning rate through a Wiebe function which depends of six parameters that change with operating conditions. The method has been applied to three different engines models (one, two and four cylinders), and the results are encouraging. 2001-01-1791. Air cooling system for small internal combus- tion engine experimental analysis. B. Facchini, G. Migliorini, and A. Vacca, Università di Firenze; G. Toderi, Università degli Studi di Parma; and L. Amone, and M. Marcacci, Piaggio &amp; C. S.p.A. In this work we illustrate a data acquisition system realization and setup for the experimental description of an air cooling system for a four-stroke, one-cylinder engine used on scooters. The high importance of the power absorbed by cooling system at medium and high rotational speeds is the first reason of this inves- tigation, our target is to point out possible increasing in the forced ventilation cooling system performances. First of all, in order to foresee the magnitude order of the mea- sured variables, we developed a theoretical one-dimensional description of the centrifugal blower, with this approach we can forecast, even if in an approximated way, the measured variables magnitude order. Obviously, in order to realize the blower and flow experimental characterization, it was necessary the choice of the right test rig. Through the experimental data analysis we had interesting informa- tions on blower real running conditions and on cooling air flow behavior inside the cowling, which directs the air coming from the blower around the main engine parts. This cooling system preliminary characterization is made with the help of an electric brake joined with the engine axis. So we could evaluate the cooling system behavior, in particular the efficiency, in various engine load conditions and have the necessary data for the second fluid dynamic numerical analysis of cooling system. 2001-01-1793. Steps towards an optimization of the dynamic emission behavior of IC engines: Measurement strategies - mod- elling - model-based optimization. Michael Hafner, Darmstadt University of Technology. New technologies have been applied to IC engines in order to ful- fill rising demands concerning consumption, drivability and emis- sions. These additional technologies result in a high amount of pro- cess inputs that are controlled by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Thus, the task of finding optimum settings for all variables becomes more and more complex. In this contribution, model-based approaches are presented which help find optimal engine control setting maps. The optimization itself bases on fast neural networks. The quality of these nets decisively depends on good measurement data. Therefore, a new advanced measurement strategy will be pres- ented which was designed to dynamically cover the whole area of interest where the engine is run. Despite an optimum stationary engine performance unfavorable combustion conditions are likely to occur during transient condi- tions leading to dynamic emission peaks. To compensate for that, predictive control functions are proposed and their parameters are determined by model-based optimization routines. 225</page><page sequence="225">2001-01-1795-2001-01-1801 2001-01-1795. Experimental investigation on an ice cooling system under nucleate boiling conditions. M. Amelio, F. Barbara, and S. Bova, Calabria Univ.; and P. Oliva, Elasis S.C.p.A. The paper presents the results of a test rig experimentation on a production model S.I. engine, whose cooling system is equipped with a 13 V - 60 W electrical pump and operates under Two-Phase Nucleate-Boiling conditions. Tests have been carried out for fixed engine load, speed and inlet coolant temperature while coolant flow rate was varied by means of pump supply voltage. The influence of coolant flow rate on cylinder head temperature, coolant expansion, coolant temperature and specific fuel consumption is preliminarily analyzed. Results indicate that reduced coolant flow rate combined with Nucleate Boiling regime achieves lower wall temperatures than standard cooling in many different engine operating conditions and that cylinder-to-cylinder temperature variations as well as tempera- ture dependence on engine speed are significantly reduced. In addi- tion, coolant expansion is moderate and specific fuel consumption difference with respect to the standard cooling configuration is neg- ligible, as long as the coolant remains under Nucleate Boiling condi- tions. Engine performance and fuel consumption, on the contrary, deteriorate if Fully Developed sub-cooled Boiling conditions are set up. Finally, the issue of identifying the On-set of Nucleate Boiling is addressed. Results show that both coolant pressure pulsations and coolant expansion can be conveniently used to this purpose. 2001-01-1797. Exhaust tuning on four-stroke engine; experi- mentation and simulation. Gordon P. Blair, Queen 's University of Belfast; and D. O. Mackey, M. C. Ashe, and G. F. Chatfìeld, OPTI- MUM Power Technology. A Yamaha YZ400, 5-valve, 4-stroke cycle, motocross racing, motorcycle engine is instrumented to provide pressure diagrams in the exhaust system which are recorded over the usable engine speed range at full throttle from 5,000 rpm to 1 1,000 rpm. The engine pro- duces a maximum of some 34 kW (46 hp) power output. The pro- duction muffler-ended exhaust system is replaced with two alterna- tive and more highly-tuned exhaust systems, namely a straight pipe and a straight pipe and diffuser. The complete engine geometry together with these two exhaust systems is simulated using an engine simulation software package (VIRTUAL 4-STROKE) and the experimentally-recorded exhaust pressure diagrams and perfor- mance characteristics of power, torque, etc., are compared with the predictions of the theoretical simulation. The variation of exhaust system produces differing performance characteristics whose origins the measured pressure diagrams and recorded performance characteristics struggle to explain. The simu- lation, on the other hand, not only computes accurately the exhaust pressure diagrams and the performance characteristics over the entire speed range but also explains the origins of the variations in these performance characteristics. This illustrates not only the effec- tiveness, or otherwise, of this type of exhaust tuning on four-stroke engines but also the effectiveness of an accurate engine simulation as a design and development tool. Finally, from the experimental and simulation evidence presented the paper draws numerical con- clusions on empirical design factors for the basics of exhaust system tuning. 2001-01-1798. Maps of discharge coefficients for valves, ports and throttles. G. P. Blair and E. Callender, Queen 's University of Belfast; and D. O. Mackey, OPTIMUM Power Technology. The paper discusses the application of maps of measured dis- charge coefficients for poppet valves, cylinder ports, and in-pipe throttles within a theoretical simulation of the unsteady gas flow through an internal combustion engine. The maps provided cover both inflow and outflow at the discontinuity being discussed and are displayed as contour maps of the discharge coefficient as some func- tion of the geometrical flow area of that discontinuity and of the pressure ratio across it up to a maximum value of 2.0. An engine simulation package is used for both a four-stroke and a two-stroke engine to determine the typical pressure ratio and area ratio characteristics which pertain at all such discontinuities at repre- sentative engine speed and load conditions. From this information it becomes possible to ascertain the regions of the discharge coeffi- cient maps which are indexed more frequently during the course of the engine simulation and which have a greater, or lesser, influence on the computational outcome, the engine gas flow rates, and, ulti- mately, on the actual performance characteristics of the simulated engine. Hence, it also informs the experimenter which regions of a contour map of discharge coefficients for a particular pipe end dis- continuity must be measured with the greatest rigor. From the information presented it is clear that the traditional method of measuring discharge coefficients of valves, ports, etc., over a range of discontinuity area but at a single, low pressure ratio is quite inadequate for the acquisition of data to accurately guide a theoretical engine simulation package. The evidence also shows that testing at a single pressure ratio can be potentially misleading even for the experimental development of the gas flow characteristics of valves, ports, etc., as a means of enhancing engine performance. 2001-01-1800. 4-stroke gasoline engine performance optim- ization using statistical techniques. V. Lakshminarasimhan, M. S. Ramasamy, and Y. Ramachandra Babu, TVS Suzuki Ltd. The engine designer has to find novel methods to optimize the engine efficiency faster as the engine development cycle is getting shortened due to the continuous growing market demands. Engine optimization involves fine tuning of the various engine parameters and conducting a large number of tests on actual engine test bed. In this paper, modern techniques that have been used to optimize a small 4-stroke air-cooled engine performance have been described. The engine has been modeled using one-dimensional thermodynamic engine modelling software (AVL-BOOST). Design of experiments (DoE) tools have been used to optimize the engine variables. The input parameters form an orthogonal array of L27 matrix and the output characteristics of the engine (responses) have been predicted by using BOOST software. This design matrix has been used to study and optimize thirteen factors in three levels (313). The results have been analyzed to find out optimum factor/level combination for the desired performance characteristics and limited number of parts have been built and tested to validate the predicted results. This methodology significantly reduced the engine develop- ment time, and the designer had a valuable insight into the engine tuning parameters which reduced the design iterations. 2001-01-1801. Study and development of lean-burn systems on small 4-stroke gasoline engine. K. Rajashekhar Swamy, Vinay Harne, and D. S. Gunjegaonkar, TVS-Suzuki Limited ; and K. V. Gopalkrishnan, Indian Institute of Technology. In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted towards improving the performance and emissions of small 4-stroke spark ignition engines by lean-burn combustion techniques. However, there are certain drawbacks associated with the lean-burn engines which are, large cyclic variations, long combustion duration, unreli- able ignition of the mixture in some cycles. An experimental investigation has been carried out on a 150 cc air-cooled four- stroke gasoline engine to improve the lean-burning limits by overcoming the difficulties associated. The following strat- egies have been considered for the study. 1. Use of catalytic materials in the combustion chamber to accel- erate combustion. 2. Pre-chamber with catalytic activation. 3. Optimization of compression ratio and valve timing to improve flame propagation. 4. By using an ignition system with high-energy spark discharge and increased spark duration, to help ignite the lean mixture. 5.

Development of four-stroke outboard motor. Masashi Takayanagi, Tadaaki Morikami, and Takuya Satoh, Suzuki Motor Corp. Suzuki Motor Corporation has developed a new four-stroke out- board motor series, 'DF90/115.Tt is an in-line 4-cylinder, DOHC 16- valve engine. The DF115 version delivers a maximum power output of 84.6 kW (115 PS). The motor features not only lower noise, vibration and fuel con- sumption than a comparable two-stroke model, but also lower emis- sions conforming to CARB (California Air Resources Board) 2008 requirements. Moreover, the size and weight of the DF90/1 15 have been significantly reduced by adopting an offset driveshaft system and a 2-stage camshaft drive system. Thus the DF90/1 15' s side pro- file is the smallest among four-stroke outboard motors in the 85 kW class. Furthermore, the new motor offers a propulsion performance equivalent to the two-stroke outboard motor, due to the development of a large high-performance propeller based on a large reduction gear ratio and a 4-2-1 exhaust system. This paper reports the tech- nologies, modal analysis and structural dynamics modifications techniques used in developing the DF90/115. 2001-01-1804. Development of a new 1.6L engine. K. Watanabe and M. Matsuki , Honda R&amp;D. This newly developed 1 .6L engine achieves, in comparison with a conventional engine, a 7% reduction in fuel consumption in stoi- chiometric operation, by improving combustion through modifica- tion of the shape of the intake port and combustion chambers, and by adopting friction-reducing technologies. Also, the adoption of a high-density, thin-walled catalyst (900 cells, 2.5 mil unit) and early activation of the catalyst through catalyst quick warm-up control, makes it possible to comply with Euro4 gas emission standards by reducing emissions in cold start and immediately thereafter. 2001-01-1806. Effect of premixed ratio on nitric oxide emis- sion in diesel engine. Chang Sik Lee, Ki Hyung Lee, and Dae Sik Kim, Hanyang University. The objective of this work was to experimentally determine the effect of premixed fuel on the reduction of exhaust emissions in die- sel engine. In order to investigate the effect of premixed ratio on the NOx and smoke in a diesel engine, the reduction effect of exhaust emissions of diesel engine is investigated by means of experimental method. In this work, a direct-injection-type diesel engine with M-combustion chamber modified by using the supply system of pre- mixed fuel into the intake manifold. The experimental apparatus consist of premixed fuel system, diesel injection system and elec- tronic control system. The injection amount of premixed fuel in the intake port controlled by electronic injection system. The results of this study show that the increase of premixed ratio of supplied fuel reduce the nitrogen oxide and smoke emissions of the engine. Based on the experimental results, the reduction of exhaust emissions and the other combustion characteristics in a small direct-injection diesel engine were discussed. 2001-01-1807. Performance and emission characteristics of diesel engines fueled by vegetable oils. Y. Yoshimoto, M. Onodera, and H. Tamaki, Niigata Institute of Technology. The aim of the present study is to clarify how utilization methods of vegetable oils influence engine performance and emissions. In the experiment, two types of small single-cylinder DI diesel engines were employed: Engine A, equipped with a bowl in the piston, is designed for use in fishing boats. Engine B has a toroidal-type com- bustion chamber and is designed for agricultural use. The experi- ments used BDF (biodiesel fuel) and rape-seed oil as the base fuel: BDF was emulsified with water and rape-seed oil was blended with several kinds of alcohol. The engine performance and emission characteristics were compared with gas oil operation. The emulsi- fied BDF reduced NOx and smoke emissions significantly although the specific energy consumption (BSEC) increased slightly depend- ing on the engine type and operating conditions. Performance tests also showed that with up to 40% (vol.) alcohol addition, the blended fuels with 1 -propanol or 1 -butanol in rape-seed oil realize stable combustion similar to gas oil operation. The smoke emissions with alcohol-blended fuels were somewhat lower than with gas oil while the BSEC was slightly higher with the alcohols. 2001-01-1808. Engine performance and exhaust gas emis- sions characteristics of (CNG/diesel) dual-fuel engine. Talal F. Yusaf, Universitiy of Southern Queensland Toowoomba; Mushtak Talib Ali Al- Atabi, Univesity of Sheffield Centre, Taylor* s College; and D. Buttsworth, Universitiy of Southern Queensland Too- woomba. Single-cylinder diesel engines are widely utilized in Malaysia to generate electricity on small scales in open markets and rural areas. This paper represents a brief study carried out to: (1) understand the nature of exhaust emissions (NOx, CO and CO2) when adopting a dual-fuel system using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) in a single- cylinder, stationary diesel engine, and (2) compare the dual-fuel emission and engine performance results to those of diesel. The use of CNG is considered a possible solution for reducing the toxic emissions from these engines. This work shows that by using the dual-fuel system, NOx, CO and CO2 concentrations in the exhaust gases were, on average, reduced by 54%, 59% and 31% respectively when the engine runs at maximum-load operating conditions. The average power output from the engine operating at dual fuel was 10% higher than that operating on diesel over the tested range of engine speeds. 2001-01-1810. Development of high-power-density small DI diesel engine for agricultural and industrial use. Tetsuya Kosaka, Tadao Okazaki, Shuichi Yamada, and Masahiro Aketa, Kubota Corp. In recent years, small diesel engines for industrial use are required to achieve still higher power output per engine size (high power density) and to have the performance to comply with strin- gent exhaust emissions standards as well. To meet these social demands and market requirements, there are various engineering tasks yet to accomplish. In this paper, two important technical issues have been focused, those are, combustion system improvement to enable lower exhaust emissions and higher power output than con- ventional models and new cooling system as a solution for increased heat load issue accompanying the progress of high power density. Firstly, for combustion system improvement, the swirl adjust- ment technique has been developed that will optimize the swirl ratio for each engine application with different load and speed condition. Intake airflow has been analyzed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach to enable adjustment of swirl ratio that plays an important role in creating air-fuel mixture. The swirl was successfully controlled by providing the originally designed config- uration on the wall, from cylinder block side, which introduces the intake air from valve throat area into cylinder. As a result, it is now possible to set optimum swirl ratio for each engine application while securing high volumetric efficiency. Next, a new cooling system has been introduced to cool down the neighborhood of top deck between cylinders where temperature becomes highest in cylinder block. The new coolant channels with built-in multiple water passages was incorporated by casting between cylinders. As a result, the temperatures between cylinders and in piston ring groove could be lowered remarkably. After overcoming these engineering challenges, the advanced high power density has successfully been materialized in small direct injection (DI) diesel engine for industrial use. 227</page><page sequence="227">2001-01-1811-2001-01-1817 2001-01-1811. Heat loss to the combustion chamber wall with deposit adhering to the wall surface in D.I. diesel engine - First report: Influence of deposit on instantaneous heat flux into the piston surfaces. H. Ishii, M. Emi , and Y. Yamada, Musashi Institute of Technology; S. Kimura, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. ; and K. Shimano, and Y. Enomoto, Musashi Institute of Technology. One of factors affecting the state of heat loss to the wall of D.I. diesel engine is the adhesion of deposit on the combustion chamber wall surfaces. In diesel engines currently used in practice, such deposit is normally adhered to the wall surface. Therefore, determi- nation of the effects of deposit on the state of heat loss is also neces- sary for the comparison with the state of heat loss measured in experiments conducted without deposit. The effects of deposit, how- ever, have not been clearly determined due partially to the complex- ity involved in the amount and the state of deposit which differ according to differences in time and location. In this regard, the authors et al., decided to make an attempt on clarification of the effects of deposit. Instantaneous heat flux has been measured at plural points on a piston surface with the adhesion of deposit, and the variation of heat flux has been also studied, which will be presented as the first report in this paper. For the purpose of measurement, thin-film thermocou- ples were embedded into the piston cavity, and the instantaneous surface temperatures at different portions in the process of deposit accumulation were measured and the values of instantaneous heat flux were calculated accordingly. As a result, it is found that the instantaneous surface temperature and instantaneous heat flux on the piston surface vary according to the difference in the amount of deposit adhered. That is, as the amount becomes greater, the phase showing the maximum value of instantaneous surface temperature tends to delay, and the temperature up and down gradient and the amplitude become smaller. Similar tendencies are also found in instantaneous heat flux, with a gentler heat flow to the piston surface per cycle. 2001-01-1812. Characteristics of combustion and exhaust gas and fuel consumption in DI diesel engine using ringed impinge- ment wall head. M. O gura and X. E. Bao, Nippon Institute of Tech- nology. The engine performance, exhaust gas emission and combustion characteristic on DI diesel engine with a ringed impingement wall were investigated about the effect of EGR in this paper. The ringed wall was attached to the cylinder head near center of combustion chamber in order to enhance the spray diffusi vity. The experimental result was shown that high EGR rate with high temperature reduced remarkably NO, HC, soot and fuel consump- tion, and also, run the gentle combustion. 2001-01-1814. Optimization of the scavenging and injection processes of an air-assisted direct fuel injection 50 cc. 2-stroke S.I. engine by means of modelling. F. Payri, Universidad Politéc- nica de Valencia ; J. Galindo, H. Climent, and J. M. Pastor, Kawa- saki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and C. Gaia, Nacional Motor S.A. DERBI. This paper summarizes the optimization work of the air-assisted direct fuel injection 50 cc. 2-stroke spark ignition DERBI TSI engine. The methodology employed is based on the use of mathe- matical models to assist to the design procedure. The models used are a ID wave action model and a 3D CFD model. In the paper is described the modelling procedure for some of the engine systems: exhaust, injection, scavenging and mixture processes. The existing ID model has been improved to simulate 2-stroke engines. Some studies have been devoted to the calculation of tapered pipes, exhaust system, reed valves and injection system. The study of the exhaust shows that only the exhaust parts closest to the cylinder have influence on the exhaust response in terms of performance. The study of the injection system shows that the injec- tion pressure and duration will depend on the discharge duct diame- ter and compressor clearance. The phase angle between engine and compressor crankshaft will not affect injection pressure or duration. A procedure for drawing new ports geometry by parametric design has been used. This allowed testing new ports geometry by CFD. Two different combustion chambers are compared in terms of mix- ture enhancement. Finally, the injection and mixture process for dif- ferent injection strategies is assessed. 2001-01-1815. Numerical analysis of mixture preparation in a reverse uniflow-type two-stroke gasoline DI engine. Yasuo Moriyoshi and Kazuhiro Kikuchi, Chiba Univ.; and Koji Morikawa and Hideharu Takimoto, Fuji Heavy Industry. The authors have been engaged in developing a new-generation two-stroke gasoline engine which could be employed ultimately for automobiles. By investigating the defects of the Schnurle-type two- stroke gasoline engine, a reverse uniflow-type direct injection engine has been developed and built. The newly introduced system employs stratified charge combustion in light-to medium-load con- ditions by using the technology already developed for the four- stroke direct injection gasoline engines while it can supply the maxi- mum power output by using a super-charger and attaining homoge- neous combustion. Engine performance is being tested experimen- tally. In order to analyze the performance test results, numerical analysis of in-cylinder phenomena, such as gas-exchange, gas motion, fuel spray formation, and mixture formation is carried out in this paper. As a result, it was found that the interaction between in-cylinder gas motion and spray motion is a very important factor to improve the combustion performance, depending on both the engine speed and engine load. 2001-01-1816. Analysis of a new water hammer gasoline direct injection system (WH-GDIS). C. M. Bartolini, F. Caresana, and G. Vincenzi, Università di Ancona. Recent research on internal combustion spark-ignited engines has focused more and more on charge control by means of direct injection. Nevertheless most of the systems proposed so far do not seem to be suitable for small engines as they are high-cost. A new direct injection system, based on the hydraulic phenome- non commonly known as 'water hammer' has been recently pro- posed by the authors to be used for small two-stroke engines. It constitutes a reliable means of achieving high injection pres- sures while maintaining the simple manufacturing and low-cost characteristics of this kind of engines. It is equipped with a low- pressure fuel pump and provides high injection pressure values thanks to the conversion of the kinetic energy of the fluid into a local pressure rise, which takes place when the fuel flow is suddenly halted by an automatic valve. The first results from a simulation code which takes into account of cavitation and column separation phenomena typical of the sys- tem's behavior are presented. The influence of various parameters on system's performances is discussed. 2001-01-1817. Compression wave injection: A mixture injec- tion method for two-stroke engines based on unsteady gas dynamics. William T. Cobb, Jr., Design &amp; Manufacturing Solutions Inc. This paper describes the fundamental principles of operation of a mixture injection system now called the Compression Wave Injec- tion system (CWI). The system has been initially designed for use in handheld lawn and garden equipment but is also appropriate for use in other two- stroke applications. The designed engines must demonstrate greatly reduced emissions of unburned hydrocarbon to attain present and future emission regulations. Because of the con- straints of the market for the handheld products, the system was designed for low-cost production and adaptation to existing prod- ucts. It was also required, from cost and operation considerations, that the system is capable of operating with fuel metering based on a carburetor. 228</page><page sequence="228">2001-01-1817-2001-01-1823 The CWI system described utilizes a compression wave derived from the combustion process of a two-stroke engine to inject a rich mixture into the cylinder of the engine. The hot gases from the com- bustion process are used to partially vaporize the fuel charge prior to entry into the cylinder. Reflected compression wave behavior is utilized to aid in the preparation of the fuel charge and deliver the charge to the cylinder after the initiation of the scavenging behavior. By utilizing the Compression Wave Injection method; low-cost, car- bureted engines can be produced that operate with well-vaporized delayed fuel entry into the cylinder in a similar fashion to direct- injected engines. Such engines display 30 percent improvement in brake specific fuel consumption and 70-85 percent reduction in emission of unburned hydrocarbon. 2001-01-1818. Direct injection application on a four-stroke motorcycle engine. C. Stan , A. Stanciu, and S. Guenther, West Saxon University of Zwickau; and L. Martorano, C. Tarantino , and M. Antonelli , Università degli Studi dì Pisa. The potential of direct injection in spark-ignition engines regard- ing the significant reduction of fuel consumption and pollutant emis- sion as well as advantages in the field of torque characteristic and acceleration behavior induced a remarkable development of GDI engines for automobile applications. The mentioned advantages are of special interest for motorcycle four-stroke engines as well. How- ever, in compact cylinder units, respectively in a wide speed range as for motorcycle engines, the adaptation of direct injection gains on complexity. The paper presents the development results of a GDI four-stroke four-valve single-cylinder motorcycle engine with 125 cc. The pres- sure pulse direct injection system developed for this application is presented from the fluid-dynamic behavior up to the obtained injec- tion spray characteristics. The mixture formation process is analyzed for different load and speed values, respectively for favorable combinations of parameters such as the injector location, the opening pressure and the injection start, using a numerical simulation method. The results of the engine tests confirm the adaptability of this concept for motorcycle engine applications. 2001-01-1819. Motorcycle fleet field test study of two-stroke catalytic converters in China. Wang Song Qin, Liu Xin , Lin Man Qun, Jia Bin , He Yuan , Wang Qing , and Ling Lei , Tianjin Univ. New Chinese national standards on motorcycles and mopeds exhaust emission have been published. Technical feasibility study of use of catalytic converters on Chinese two-stroke motorcycles was conducted by means of mileage tests. 100, 90 and 50 ml motor- cycles were included in the test fleet and different converters coated in China were tested. Different factors producing different effects on converter performance were investigated such as exhaust temper- ature, lubrication oil, and second air injection system. 2001-01-1820. Influence of location of catalytic converter on two-stroke engine performance. Władysław Mitianiec, Cracow University of Technology. In modern two-stroke SI engines, applying one or two segments of catalytic converter in exhaust system is needed to fulfill require- ments of emission of toxic components in burnt gases. In the paper, dependence of location of catalytic converter with defined mass flow rate and resistance inside outflow system on engine perfor- mance, especially power and fuel consumption is described. Paper gives mathematical model of gas flow in a 4tuned' exhaust system with taking into account resistant of gas flow through catalytic con- verter. On the base of mathematical model calculation of physical parameter of gas for different location of monolith were done with overall engine output parameters. This enables optimization of whole exhaust system at conservation of high temperature in the monolith. In the paper, result of simulation (torque, fuel consump- tion, residual gas, etc.) were given in comparison to original engine. Also experimental results made on stand with 125 cc two-stroke engine with the same geometrical parameters of exhaust system as in calculation are included and compared with computational results. Paper includes several figures obtained from computer pro- gram based on zero- and one-dimensional model as well from CFD program and experimental work with temperature and pressure dis- tribution along exhaust pipe. 2001-01-1821. The development and application of 2-stroke catalysts for 2-wheelers in Europe and Asia. David Coultas , Mar- tyn Twigg, Richard O 'Sullivan, and Neil Collins, Johnson Matthey pic. The exhaust gas mixture of a carburettored 2-stroke engine requires specially designed catalyst formulations if optimum pollu- tant conversions, durability and cost requirements are to be realized. Formulation improvements which increase the conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) allow manufacturers to tune their vehicles richer to give more power, improve rideability and promote longer engine life. In order to design catalyst formulations which facilitate engine tuning whilst still meeting legislative emissions targets, a study was performed on the effects of platinum group metal (PGM) combina- tions and advanced washcoat materials on CO performance. The effect of PGM and washcoat materials on fresh and aged CO con- version were assessed on vehicles representative of the European, Chinese and Indian markets. A road-correlated bench engine aging cycle was used to simulate 30,000 km road aging. Through the development of advanced washcoat materials and their targeted interactions with PGM, special high performance catalysts were for- mulated that gave enhanced CO conversion under two-stroke exhaust conditions. 2001-01-1822. Precious metal strategies for catalytic emission control in new generation 4-stroke two-wheelers. J. Adomaitis, J. Dettling, M. Larkin, M. Galligan, and B. Yavuz, Engelhard Corp. Catalytic emission control for two-wheelers has been widely used in a number of markets around the world for many years. The successful application of catalysts to many two- wheelers, in particu- lar those with 2-stroke engines, and the desire for cleaner vehicles are leading to increasingly tighter emission regulations worldwide for those vehicles. These facts, coupled with changing market forces, are shifting the focus of catalyst applications from 2-stroke engines to 4-stroke engines. Inherently cleaner, particularly for hydrocarbons (HC), 4-stroke engines until now have utilized very basic approaches to emissions control. Most have required no cata- lyst at all, relying only on adjustments to engine tuning. Some others have utilized secondary air injection (SAI) to reduce carbon monox- ide (CO) emissions. But new regulations coming into force around the world in the next few years will almost certainly require catalytic emissions control on many or most two-wheelers with 4-stroke engines. This paper will describe some of the approaches being taken to reformulate and optimize existing catalyst formulations for future 4-stroke engine applications. 2001-01-1823. Flextube™ catalyst performance in 4-stroke motorcycle exhaust systems. M. P. Larkin, J. C. Dettling, and M. P. Galligan, Engelhard Corp. An analysis of 4-stroke motorcycle emission systems indicates that a heat tube has the potential for meeting the regulatory stan- dards if the location in the exhaust pipe matches the specific operat- ing temperature requirements of the device. The location of a heat tube is determined by the diameter and shape of the exhaust pipe. Since the exhaust flowrate and temperature across the catalytic device determine its effectiveness, it is suggested that a flexible cat- alyzed tube, which could be placed anywhere in the exhaust, would have a greater potential than a rigid heat tube for solving a wide range of emission application needs. To maximize the benefit from such a simple, cost-effective device, application of the 4 flex-tube catalyst' was studied over a wide range of conditions. 229</page><page sequence="229">2001-01-1823-2001-01-1832 A test matrix that used high and low levels of Pt/Rh ratio and tube diameter was used to study 'flex-tube catalyst' performance in 4-stroke motorcycle exhaust systems. Engine variables include inlet temperature, AFR, exhaust flow and backpressure. Catalyst vari- ables that were probed included tube diameter, precious metal ratio, and rigid or Flextube™ design. Data will be presented to show the benefits of such a device in various configurations. Performance is assessed by comparing the conversion of pollutants at various tem- peratures and flowrates. 2001-01-1825. Mutagenicity and PAH:s of particulate emis- sions of two-stroke chainsaw engines. S. Laanti and J. Sorvari, Fortum Oil and Gas Oy; E. Elonen , Research Center of Agricultural Technology; and M. Pitkänen, Remira Metalkat Oy. Particulate emissions of a two-stroke chainsaw engine were col- lected under controlled conditions in a test bench using a dilution tunnel for sampling. Two different types of gasolines and lubricat- ing oils and the effect of exhaust after-treatment catalyst were stud- ied. Particulate bound PAH:s and mutagenicity of the collected sam- ples were determined. The particulates were found to originate mainly from the lubri- cating oil. There was a good correlation between the particulate bound PAH: s and the mutagenicity of the soluble organic fraction of the particulates. The amount of SOF was &gt;95% and originated mainly from lubricating oil. The catalyst performed more effectively with totally non-aromatic gasoline and synthetic lubricating oil than with reformulated gasoline with aromatics &lt; 35 vol-% and mineral oil-based lubricating oil. Using MTBE as an oxygenate in non- aromatic, special small engine gasoline reduced the PAH emissions and mutagenicity significantly even without the catalyst and the cat- alyst reduced the emissions even further. 2001-01-1826. Scavenge loss mechanisms and their driving forces in loop-scavenged high-performance two-stroke engines. H. Rosskamp , A. Klimmek , and P. Pretzsch, Andreas STIHL AG&amp;Co.; and M. Mugele , University of Karlsruhe. To fulfill the forthcoming EPA and CARB emission legislations for handheld outdoor power equipment, strong efforts are undertaken to reduce the high hydrocarbon emissions of two-stroke engines. This is due to the fact that the two-stroke engine has a much better power- to- weight ratio than a mini-four- stroke engine. The research focuses on the one hand into the development of new two- stroke technologies such as charge stratification or compression wave injection for example. On the other hand, there is still a signifi- cant potential in improving the scavenging process of the conven- tional Schnlirle-scavenged two-stroke engine. This paper focuses into the analysis of the internal flow behavior of the Schntirle-type scavenge flow in a 64 cm3 high-performance two-stroke engine for handheld products. The flow analysis is con- ducted by means of transient 3D-CFD calculations that are based on experimental data. A newly developed postprocessing approach allows for a detailed analysis of different loss paths during scaveng- ing. The results show that four distinguished loss mechanisms exist: Direct mixture short-circuiting, late loop losses, central mixing losses and near- wall secondary flow losses. These four loss mecha- nisms are quantified in their contribution to the overall losses and the driving mechanisms are outlined. The newly identified second- ary flow path carries a quantity of hydrocarbon losses as significant as direct mixture short-circuiting. 2001-01-1827. Emission and consumption reduction for small two-stroke gasoline engines. D. Drecq, P. E. Benteyn, and A. du Gardin , D2T Drecq Daniel Technologies; and T. Conte , CD- AD AP CO. Automotive pollutant emissions have been drastically restricted during the last ten years. These emission standards are now concern- ing small two- stroke engines. A lot of technologies are offered to automotive engine manufacturers, such as direct injection or catalyst converter, but needs for low production price do not allow small two-stroke engine designers to use such evolutions. So, despite its high weight and complex mechanic, today's trend is towards four-stroke cycle. In order to meet future emission standards, different concepts have been implemented on a small two-stroke engine. An optimum combination between boost pressure and port timing has been found, using CFD, connected with results from hydraulic simula- tion, in correlation with tests on engine. The intake required condi- tions are reached through an external device, which is giving the right in-cy linder scavenging flow. Significant gains have been observed, concerning pollutant emis- sions as well as fuel consumption. These concepts allow small two- stroke engines to meet future regulations, keeping its advantages in price and weight. 2001-01-1830. Emissions of small 2S SI engine for handheld machinery-nanoparticulates and particulate matter. Jan Czer- wiński , AFHB; Max Wyser-Heusi, BUWAL; and Andreas Mayer , TTM. Small off-road 2-stroke SI engines have very high pollutant emissions. The Swiss environmental protection agency (BUWAL) investigates the state of the technology and emissions with the scope to show the potential of improvements by means of the best avail- able technology (BAT) and to motivate the consumers to use the more sophisticated equipment and cleaner fuels to protect their health and the environment. In the present work emission measurements of chainsaws were performed with a special concern of particulate emissions. Particu- lates were analyzed by means of: gravimetry, SMPS, NanoMet and differential analysis of filter residue. The varied conditions were: A/F ratio, lube-oil content and the fuel quality. It has been shown, that the particulate mass and the nanoparticle numbers, which both consisting almost exclusively of unburned lube-oil, attain very high values. They are strongly influenced by the mixture tuning and by the lube-oil content. Also a special aromats- free fuel shows positive results. Comparatively to the emissions of modern diesel engines the specific PM emissions of small 2S SI engines are very high and should be carefully considered in the future. 2001-01-1832. Low-emission snowmobiles - The 2001 SAE clean snowmobile challenge. Jeff J. White and James N. Carroll , Southwest Research Institute; Lori M. Fusself Institute of Science, Ecology, and the Environment; and Howard E. Haines, Montana Department of Environmental Quality. The first Clean Snowmobile Challenge (CSC) was held in Jack- son Hole, Wyoming in late March of 2000. It drew public attention to environmental issues associated with recreational products such as snowmobiles, and encouraged development of novel solutions through this SAE-sponsored student competition. While much good information was obtained, one area needing improvement was emis- sions measurement. In 2000, snowmobile emissions were measured using a drive-by infrared-type device. While this provided a rough indication of emission levels, more accurate data was desired to bet- ter reflect progress in reducing emissions. For this year's competition, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) assembled the equipment necessary to provide brake- specific emis- sions measurement on-site. A truck-mounted mobile unit was outfit- ted with laboratory-grade instrumentation for measurement of HC, CO, NOx, CO2, and O2. A snowmobile chassis dynamometer was used to load the engines. A modified version of the five-mode snow- mobile test cycle, as developed by SwRI for the International Snow- mobile Manufacturers Association (ISM A), was used for testing. Fourteen teams entered snowmobiles in the completion, employ- ing a range of technologies, including both 2- and 4-stroke designs and aftertreatment. A detailed summary of competition emission results is included, along with a discussion of the effectiveness of various design approaches in reducing emissions. 230</page><page sequence="230">2001-01-1834-2001-01-1840 2001-01-1834. An experimental survey on the emissions char- acteristics of small S.I. engines for non-road mobile machinery. F. Millo , Politecnico di Torino; G. Cornetti Metaricerche; and W. Miersch, Ab gasprüf stelle. An experimental investigation was carried out in order to point out the state of the art of the exhaust emissions of small spark igni- tion engines for non-road mobile machinery. 14 different engines from different manufacturers, with rated power below 18 kW, were selected as representative of the most common non-road mobile machinery, including lawn mowers, chain saws, trimmers, snow-removal equipments and portable gensets: 10 engines were 4-stroke (one of which also equipped with a three-way catalyst), while 4 were 2-stroke (three of which equipped with an oxidation catalyst). After a run-in period, exhaust emissions were measured accord- ing to different test cycles: moreover, an endurance run test of 100 hours was also performed for 5 engines. Finally, the specific exhaust emissions obtained with different test cycles and according to different test procedures were com- pared, in order to find out not only the current pollutant emission level for small s.i. engines, but also to evaluate its sensitivity to dif- ferent measuring procedures. 2001-01-1835. Effect of fuel and catalytic converter on emis- sions from small two-stroke engine. E. Elonen , Agrifood Research Finland; S. Laanti, Fortum Oil and Gas Oy; and M. Pitkänen, Kemira Metalkat Oy. The effect of fuel and catalytic converter on emissions from a small 2-stroke engine was studied in this work. These measurements were made at Agrifood Research Finland, Agricultural Engineering Research (MTT/V akola) and they are a part of the national Promo- tor-research program. The Promotor-program (http://www.vtt.fi/ virtual/promotor/) is a coordinated research effort on the develop- ment of fuels; internal combustion engines and exhausts treatment. Other participants of this 'Reduction of emissions from small engines' -project are: The Laboratory for Atmospheric Physics and Chemistry at the University of Kuopio, Kemira Metalkat Oy, For- tum Oil and Gas Oy and Oulu Regional Institute of Occupational Health. Measurements were made in laboratory conditions with a 45 cm3 engine. Three different fuels and one catalytic converter were used. Three different air- fuel ratios were used approximately from ^=0,75 to h= 0,92. Regulated emissions were measured. In addition the effect of the amount of 2-stroke oil was briefly investigated. Fuel has an effect on HC, NOx and PM emissions. Catalytic con- verter has a similar effect on emissions. 2001-01-1836. Oil consumption optimization in a small 4-stroke gasoline engine. Mohan D. Umate, C. Subramoniam, Y. Ramachandra Babu , and Vinay Harne , M/s TVS Suzuki Ltd. It is well understood that the consumption of lube oil should be reduced to minimum due to stringent emission norms and the need to reduce visual smoke. We have used statistical methods for optimizing engine performance parameters due to limited time availability for product development. In this paper, techniques that have been used to develop and opti- mize a small 4-stroke gasoline engine have been described. This work is focussed mainly on oil consumption due to piston assembly and cylinder block. The piston ring assembly has been modeled using simulation software (RINGPAK). Design of Experiments (DoE) tools have been used to optimize the variables/critical factors. The significant factors were identified through ANOVA (Analy- sis of Variance) table on the above responses. A test procedure has been judiciously finalized to evaluate the optimized parameters. The best combination of factors/levels was arrived at by using the above results and was evaluated through test rig trials. The above methodology of combining ringpak modelling and DoE techniques helped to optimize oil consumption at the design stage with significant reduction in development time. 2001-01-1837. Quantitative evaluation method of engine noise. H. Suda , Suzuki Motor Corp. Running performance, output power and styling aside, mechani- cal noise is also an important factor for determining the merchandise value of a motorcycle. However, the evaluation of mechanical noise has conventionally relied on human judgment and thus posed prob- lems with respect to the uniformity, consistency and reproducibility of evaluation results. We therefore attempted to develop a method of quantitatively expressing the intensity of mechanical noise. Two principal aspects of mechanical noise are discussed in this paper. One was the 'rattling noise' that is periodically generated when a motorcycle is idling at a constant engine speed. The other was the "whistling noise' that is generated when the engine speed varies, for example, when the engine is raced. Instead of evaluating the level (i.e., sound pressure) of the motorcycle's overall noise that includes exhaust noise, we used as evaluation values the ratios of rattling and whistling noise levels to the overall noise level. This method produced evaluation results that more closely reflected human perceptions. Further, we made this evaluation hard- ware system as simple as possible for easier on-site use. 2001-01-1838. Prediction of small engine noise radiation by the multi-code approach. G. Chiatti and O. Chiavola , University of ' Roma TRE'. An integrated numerical procedure has been developed in order to predict the noise radiation of small engine for automotive and general purpose applications. In exhaust system of single- or multi-cylinder small engine, com- plex shape elements are always included (junction, compact cham- ber), where non-planar higher-order modes exist. Besides, the amplitude of pressure wave, propagating inside such exhaust sys- tems, is generally not bounded by linear acoustic limit. For these reasons, aimed at providing realistic and accurate description of their fluid dynamic and acoustic behavior, an inte- grated multi-code methodology, based on 0D, ID and 3D models, has been set up; the investigation of the flow conditions all through- out the exhaust system, allows to predict the sound emission. The developed approach retains the advantages of all methods: detailed information of flow behavior as it is able to accurately pre- dict, with the 3D scheme, the propagation of the pressure waves through complex elements, such as junctions, avoiding the signifi- cant limitations that a one-dimensional schematization always intro- duces, as well as fast processing typical of ID and 0D schemes devoted to the analysis of ducts and volumes. The multi-code method, set up and tested, has been applied on a typical small four-stroke diesel engine. The evaluation of the noise emission has been carried out and the results have been compared with experimental measurements. 2001-01-1839. Development and evaluation of a reverse uni- flow-type two-stroke gasoline DI engine. K. Morikawa and H. Takimoto , Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.; and Y. Moriyoshi, K. Kikuchi, and T. Naito, Chiba Univ. In order to improve the drawbacks of current Schnürle-type two- stroke gasoline engine, a reverse uniflow-type two-stroke direct injection engine was designed and developed. The scavenging port and piston geometry combined with a direct injection system were designed to realize both stratified charge combustion in light to medium load and higher power output in high load range. In- cylinder gas motion and spray behavior were analyzed and opti- mized by numerical simulation. The experimental result shows high BMEP in WOT operation achieved by a high delivery ratio, high trapping efficiency and good scavenging. In light to medium load a stable combustion was achieved by good stratified combustion uti- lizing a spray and wall-guided mixture preparation. 2001-01-1840. Experimental analysis of a two-stroke direct injection engine prototype. C. M. Bartolini , F. Caresana, and G. Vincenzi , Università di Ancona. 231</page><page sequence="231">2001-01-1840-2001-01-1848 Several studies are currently dealing with the so-called 'new gen- eration two-stroke engines.' In nearly all these, charge control by means of fuel injection has been proposed to overcome the well- known problems of fuel and lube-oil consumption, and the probably unacceptable level of pollutant emissions. Direct injection, in partic- ular, seems to guarantee the best results as it allows to avoid the short-circuiting of the fuel to the exhaust. The direct-injection systems proposed in recent times do not seem to be widely applicable especially to small two-stroke engines as they introduce considerably complicated and consequently high- cost systems. A new direct injection system, based on the hydraulic phenomenon commonly known as 'water hammer, 'has been pro- posed by the authors as a reliable means of achieving high injection pressures while maintaining the simple manufacturing and low-cost characteristics of two-stroke engines. Though ideal for small two- stroke engines this concept appears suitable also for every other kind of spark-ignited engine. The system, equipped with a low-pressure fuel pump, provides high injection pressure values thanks to the conversion of the kinetic energy of the fluid into a local pressure rise which takes place when the fuel flow is suddenly halted by an auto- matic valve. 2001-01-1842. Two-stroke direct injection spark ignition engine for two wheelers. M. Gambino and S. Iannaccone, Istituto Motori - CNR. Two-stoke engine for mopeds and motorcycles is reaching an important appointment for its survival. In fact, already with the introduction of EURO 1 emission limits, it was necessary to modify some components of the propulsion apparatus in order to reduce especially the huge amount of HC emissions, due to the mixture losses during the scavenging. It was demonstrated that an effective solution to lessen emis- sions, including benzene, from current two-stroke engines for two wheelers, could be retrofitting circulating vehicles with a catalyst. But this is not enough to comply with the future more stringent European limits. A powerful solution has been suggested by important Italian two- wheeler manufactures based on the direct injection of gasoline, dur- ing the compression stroke, when the exhaust port is closed. The engine is described in the paper, in terms of performance and emis- sions, and the main results are reported. 2001-01-1843. Improving the performance of two-stroke spark ignition engine by direct injection. E. Ramakrishnan, Rob- ert Bosch India Ltd.; and B. Nagalingam and K. V. Gopalakrishnan, Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Two-Stroke Spark Ignition Engines have high exhaust emissions and low brake thermal efficiency due to the short-circuiting losses and incomplete combustion, which occur during idling and at part- load operating conditions. In the present work an attempt was made to eliminate the short-circuiting losses by direct injection. A low- pressure direct fuel injection system was developed with the Bosch electric fuel pump and solenoid injector. The necessary electronic control unit hardware and software were developed in the institute for research purpose. The present work was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, the carburetor was replaced by the mani- fold injection system and the performance of the system was opti- mized for minimum emissions. In the second phase, the extra reed valve concept reference (10) was implemented on the manifold injection system to improve scavenging. In the final phase the direct injection system was developed which eliminates short-circuiting losses completely. The performance, emissions and combustion characteristics of the above three systems at 2500, 3000, 3500 and 4000 rpm were analyzed on a 150-cc single-cylinder engine. The operation of the three systems and their benefits are described in detail in the following sections. 2001-01-1844. Research and development of a direct injec- tion stratified charge rotary engine with a pilot flame ignition system. Takumi Muroki , Kanagawa Institute of Technology; Yasuo Moriyoshi and Masahide Takagi, Chiba Univ.; and Kou Suzuki and Masayuki Imai, Kanagawa Institute of Technology. A Direct Injection Stratified Charge Rotary Engine (DISC-RE) with a pilot flame ignition system has been studied to find the possi- bility of simultaneous reductions of fuel consumption rate and HC exhaust gas emissions. Firstly, combustion characteristics in a model combustion chamber, which simulates the DISC-RE were examined from the viewpoints of calculation and experiment. The high-speed photography and the indicated pressure analysis were experimentally performed while numerical calculations of the mix- ture formation and combustion processes were also carried out. As a result, it has been found that the combustion using the pilot flame ignition system is much activated and a better ignitability is attained under lean mixtures than using a spark ignition system. Secondly, a single rotor with 650 cc displacement DISC-RE was built as a pro- totype. Combustion characteristics and its performance were tested using a combustion analyzer. Light oil and kerosene were used for performance tests. As a result, the DISC-RE showed capabilities of practical use. Also, this engine could be stably operated using multi- fuel such as gasoline, light oil, or kerosene. 2001-01-1845. Thermal analysis of electrically heated catalyst to reduce cold-start emission from gasoline engine. S. Sendilve- lan , K. Jeyachandran , and K. Bhaskar, Anna Univ. This paper deals with the development and performance of the Low Mass Electrically Heated Catalytic (LMEHMC) converter with copper oxide as a catalyst in a spark-ignition (SI), gasoline-fueled engine. It is found that the LMEHMC reduces cold-start hydrocar- bon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission, when used with existing catalytic converter. From this, the potential of catalytic sys- tems with copper oxide as catalyst is analyzed. 2001-01-1847. DI two-stroke engine catalyst development for 2 wheelers application. J. C. Dabadie and J. Lavy, I.F.P.; and J. Favennec and M. Dubus, ROSI. New legislation on two wheelers pollutant emissions has forced two-stroke engine manufacturers to study the DI technology. Piag- gio scooter ET2 Injection is the first two-wheelers engine in mass production, using a Direct Injection two-stroke 50 cc engine. This DI engine, using the FAST system, strongly decreases the pollutant emissions and increases the engine efficiency. Piaggio was the coordinator of the DOLCE project (Develop- ment Of innovative Low pollutant, low noise, low fuel Consumption two-stroke spark ignition Engines for future vehicles for individual urban mobility) supported by the European Commission where ROSI and IFP have worked together on the optimization of the cata- lyst system design of this engine. This project was been completed in 2000. For such a DI 2-stroke engine, exhaust gas can be very lean. To optimize the catalyst aftertreatment, several catalyst precious metal (PM) loads and configurations (size, density,...) have been tested on a Piaggio 125 cc FAST engine, set up on a dyno test bench where it was possible to reproduce equivalent R40 ECE driving conditions. Influence of hot tubes or coated wall on the catalyst efficiency and on the catalyst temperature has been investigated. The main work has been focused on HC and CO efficiency but the catalytic behavior for NOx has also been investigated, DI 2 stroke engines producing more NOx than carburetted engines. 2001-01-1848. Catalyst technology for reducing motorcycle emissions under ECE-R40, ECE-R47 and Indian drive cycles. Wen-Shing Chang , Hsiao-Chung Wu, and Aaron Wang, Sengton Transportation Implements Co., Ltd. The application of catalytic converters is the most cost-efficient way to meet stricter motorcycle emission standards. This paper attempts to evaluate the catalyst performance for motorcycles in 232</page><page sequence="232">2001-01-1848-2001-01-1855 Taiwan, Europe, and India over the ECE-R40, ECE-R47 and Indian Drive Cycle. Results of simulated exhaust system and vehicle tests indicate that the light-off performance and thermal stability of Pd/ Pt-perovskite and Pd/Pt/Rh-perovskite catalysts are better than those of the conventional Pt/Rh catalyst. Perovskite oxide with precious metals gives higher activity and durability and copes better with the stricter motorcycle emissions regulations expected in the future. As perovskite oxide enhances the activity of precious metal, less pre- cious metal is required, resulting in a significant cost reduction. 2001-01-1849. Virtual assessment of motorcycle vibrations. Hiroyuki Kuwahara, Yoji Fukui, and Hideki Kido , Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and P. Mas, and B. Vandenplas, LMS International. While on the one hand the development period to meet the mar- ket needs to be as short as possible and cost reduction of products is extremely important for manufacturers, the demands for environ- mental considerations and riders' comfort have recently been rap- idly increasing in the area of motorcycle performance as well. Con- sidering these arguments, this paper discusses how to establish tech- nology to predict riders' vibration comfort of a motorcycle, starting from a computer-aided design (CAD). So far, only a few papers on the prediction of motorcycle vibration have already been made pub- lic, but with regard to modelling the connection between component models even less literature is available and, as a result, empirical fig- ures are widely used. Therefore this paper focuses on the modelling aspects of these connectors to make accurate virtual models that allow the assessment of motorcycle vibrations in operational condi- tions. In addition, technology is shown to calculate the operational forces, acting on the engine and to effectively use CAD, which recently have been developed tremendously with the use of digital technology. 2001-01-1850. A new analysis approach for motorcycle brake squeal noise and its adaptation. Hiroyuki Nakata, Kiyoshi Kobayashi, and Masashi Kajita, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and C. H. Jerry Chung, MTS Systems Co. Concerning low-frequency brake squeal noises of motorcycles, the noise caused by structural instability of the system was solved with the analysis of the mode-coupling mechanism by the complex eigenvalue analysis. An equation of motion of the brake system was simplified by converting from physical domains to modal domains. Required parameters for the stability analysis were obtained from the normal mode solution of system model. Moreover, the time for a repeat calculation in different friction coefficients and an instabili- ty-causes analysis in a mode were enabled to decrease 70% or more by using a numerical-analysis solver. An analysis model with high accuracy was established and was applied to the new approach, and to specify a mode affecting squeal noises and to study countermea- sures were performed. From the test result for modified brake sys- tem, it was verified that the new method is effective for predictions and countermeasures of noises in the designing stage. 2001-01-1851. Development of aerodynamic characteristics for motorcycles using scale model wind tunnel. Yuji Araki and Kazuhiro Gotou, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. In development of motorcycles, striking a good balance between aerodynamic performance and aesthetic design and shortening the development period are extremely important subjects for improve- ment of product value and cost efficiency. There are various demands on aerodynamic performance of motorcycles, for example, the lower aerodynamic drag, aerody- namic stability, protective function against wind pressure on riders (hereinafter referred to as 4 wind protection'), low aeroacoustic noise and so on, for which various studies are made in every stage of development. This paper presents an outline of the aerodynamic development of motorcycles by using wind tunnels, and shows the effectiveness of using a scale model wind tunnel by giving the following three examples of aerodynamic development. 1. The aerodynamic drag force of a 600 cc Supersports-type motorcycle was reduced by 10% compared with the previous model by optimizing the shape of the fairings. 2. The aeroacoustic noise which riders suffer was reduced by 1. 1-3.7 dB for a 250 cc scooter. 3. The wind protection for a 1300 cc Sport/touring-type motorcy- cle was developed by an in-depth survey of flow around riders. 2001-01-1852. Experimental and computational study for the optimization of race car intake air flow. A. De Vita, University of L'Aquila; and L. Andreassi and L. Di Angelo, University of Tor Vergata. The increasing performances of internal combustion engines for race car has driven to develop special systems in order to improve the volumetric efficiency. To this aim, in the last years, a great effort has been done especially in studying geometries for airbox, turbo- compressors, special exhaust systems, etc. In this paper, the project of a 'high-performance' airbox for a nat- urally aspirated internal combustion engine (ICE) of a car racing in prototype sport competitions is described. In order to optimize the airbox geometry under extremely complex operative conditions, the fluid dynamic phenomena inside the airbox have been studied by means of a three-dimensional computational code (3D CFD). This approach has allowed to study different airbox geometry and to define the one to be realized and tested on race track. The new airbox geometry, defined in this way, has brought good results. In fact, the tests on racetrack, show that there is great improvement of car performances in comparison to the ones obtained with the unmodified airbox. 2001-01-1853. Reducing exhaust emissions and increasing power output using a tuned exhaust pipe on a two-stroke engine. R. U. K. Gustaf sson, Husqvarna AB; G. P. Blair, Queen 's Univer- sity of Belfast; and B. I. R. Jonsson, Husqvarna AB. At the 1999 SETC meeting, a paper presented a simple, tuned and silenced exhaust system for a two-stroke engine which theoreti- cally reduced both noise and exhaust emissions and increased engine power and fuel efficiency. In this paper that design concept is applied to a small 56 cc industrial engine and experimentally shown to deliver the projected behavior which was predicted in that earlier publication. Experimental test results are presented for power output, fuel consumption, and exhaust emissions to illustrate these statements. An accurate engine simulation software package (VIR- TUAL 2-STROKE) is employed to model the entire two-stroke engine and to demonstrate not only its effectiveness as a design tool in this area but also that it can accurately predict the above- mentioned performance and emission characteristics. By examining the output of the engine simulation it becomes possible to determine the gas dynamic and thermodynamic origins of the improvement in these performance characteristics and to inexpensively use that tool for further optimization and enhancement of the engine performance and exhaust emissions. 2001-01-1855. Integrated numerical-experimental method in high-speed 2T gasoline engine design refinement. G. Chiatti and O. Chiavola, University of 4 Rome Tre' - Rome. A complete two-stroke-engine predictive tool has been devel- oped in order to evaluate how geometric parameters affect both per- formances and exhaust emissions. The method is based on a two-step procedure. In the former one, the coupling between 0D and ID simulation schemes, used to model engine volumes and ducts respectively, provides the boundary con- ditions necessary for the latter procedure, in which a 3D approach is applied to a variable geometry in order to obtain detailed informa- tion of cylinder flow and concentration fields during the scavenging period. The first step retains the advantages of being a simple and rapid facility as it doesn't demand carefulness in the preliminary activity devoted to define the calculation geometry; moreover it is able to 233</page><page sequence="233">2001-01-1855-2001-01-1860 compute global parameters (torque, fuel and air consumption). For these reasons it can be considered a suitable tool to be extensively adopted together with the experimental process. The second step is devoted to the comprehension of the phenom- ena and to the evaluation of the different pathways, which the subse- quent optimization process should be directed to. The overall procedure has been tested on a high-speed small two- stroke engine by comparing the numerical results with experimental data. Then, the validated method has been used to evaluate the effect of transfer port geometric variations on performances and loss of fresh mixture. 2001-01-1857. Results of temperature-controlled autoignition combustion over the hydrocarbons emissions and fuel consump- tion at light loads in a 50 cm3 two-stroke engine. Carmen Barrios Sanchez and Jesús Casanova Kindelan , Universidad Politénica de Madrid. Nowadays in the field of internal combustion engines research there is an important interest on a new combustion process that promises great advances in the reduction of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. This paper describes the successful application of The Tempera- ture Controlled Autoignition Combustion on a small (50 cm3 ) two- stroke engine tested under laboratory conditions. The engine is a commercial model, used to power scooters, chainsaws and lawn mowers. The paper also details the experimental setup, the particular problems associated to the small size of the engine, the operational conditions and the engine modifications required to make possible a stable and uniform Temperature-Controlled Autoignition Com- bustion at light loads. Also the characteristics of new data acquisi- tion software specially designed and tailored for this study are described. One of the weak points of this kind of engine is the strong irregu- larity from cycle to cycle that appears when operated at partial loads, which produce high unburned hydrocarbons emissions and a consid- erable increase in fuel consumption. As the experiment confirms, the Temperature-Controlied Autoignition Combustion greatly improves this instability problem. Statistic study is presented to sup- port this. As a result of the great number of tests at different conditions the authors were able to determine the ranges of relevant parameters (air/fuel ratio, exhaust temperature, chamber wall temperature, etc.) in which it is feasible to run the engine under Temperature- Controlied Autoignition Combustion. The results and curves obtained experimentally shows an impor- tant reduction in fuel consumption and exhaust emission of unburned hydrocarbons. Finally, a discussion of the results is presented. 2001-01-1858. Influence of engine parameters on ATAC behavior in a G.D.I. two-stroke engine. R. Gentili , S. Frigo , F. Cozzolino , and S. Zanforlin, Università di Pisa. In two-stroke S.I. engines, direct fuel injection allows avoiding fuel loss from the exhaust port, since the cylinder is scavenged only with air. However, only if injection produces charge stratification, also combustion difficulties at light loads, due to the excessive presence of residual in the cylinder, can be removed. An alternative solution for this problem is ATAC (Active Thermo Atmosphere Combus- tion), which turns the effect of residual gas from negative to posi- tive, since its thermal energy is used to prime the combustion of fresh gas. ATAC leads to very good combustion stability with small cycle-to-cycle variation and to good fuel economy and low exhaust emissions of unburned hydrocarbons. This paper deals with ATAC combined with direct fuel injection, both of the air-assisted medium-pressure type and of the liquid high- pressure type. In the case of liquid injection, also ATAC dependence on relevant parameters, such as injection timing, injection pressure and exhaust timing has been investigated, with the intent of expand- ing ATAC existence field towards the lowest speeds and loads, as it is required for an appropriate application of this unconventional combustion to production engines. 2001-01-1859. Towards a better understanding of controlled auto-ignition (CAI™) combustion process from 2-stroke engine results analyses. Jacques Lavy and Christian Angelberger, IFP ; and Philippe Guibert and Smäil Mokhtari , Laboratoire de Mécanique Physique. Owing to its inherent high internal residual gas rate in partial load operation, the 2-stroke engine has been the first application to take benefit of the unconventional CAI™ (Controlled Auto- ignition) combustion process. For a long time, the objective of the different research works on 2-stroke engines optimization was to eliminate its two main drawbacks leading to high emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and a poor fuel efficiency. The first one is the unstable running operation combined with incomplete combus- tion, especially at light load. The second one is fuel short circuit at medium and full load. From the end of seventies, an approach devel- oped by Onishi from Nippon Clean Engine was to take benefit of an high amount of hot internal residual gases to help auto-ignition of the fresh charge. This solution has been further developed up to the industrialization on 2-stroke engines. More recently, within the framework of the European 4-SPACE program driven by IFP, the CAI™ combustion process has been successfully applied to a 4-stroke engine, demonstrating its potential for near-zero NOx emission levels combined with a significant fuel saving and thus reduction of CO2 emissions. This application was directly derived from 2-stroke engine analyses which can be consid- ered as an useful tool to better understand this combustion process. This paper presents several approaches to analyze this unconven- tional combustion process by combining 2-stroke engine trials on a dyno test bench with more advanced research and development tools such as 3D CFD and optical diagnostics. The fluid dynamical behavior in the cylinder during the scavenge process and the com- pression stroke was studied using 3D CFD and showed that the mix- ing level between the fresh charge and the internal residual gases is a key parameter to obtain and to control CAI™. The experiments performed on an optically accessible engine allowed to make direct visualization of combustion and to show the outline of the zones of combustion from an initiation and develop- ment point of view. Results obtained by a Mie scattering technique allowed us to distinguish the distribution of fresh and residual gases during the scavenging process and the compression stroke in motored conditions. The application of this optical technique com- bined with direct combustion visualization gives more detailed information on the physical process, especially when studying the effects of certain parameters as the engine speed. The post- processing of the images allowed notably to estimate the number of auto-ignition sites and the propagation mode of the combustion. 2001-01-1860. A study on the plasma jet diffusive combus- tion. Masaya Ogawa, Hisatoshi Sasaki , Koji Yoshida, and Hideo Shoji, Nihon Univ.; and Hidenori Tanaka , National Defense Acad- emy. A new concept of combustion which is using the characteristic of plasma jet ignition, that is the plasma jet diffusive combustion is proposed. The constant volume vessel is used for the experiment, and methanol is charged in the cavity of plasma jet injector and the air at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is charged in the combustion chamber. The combustion characteristic is analyzed by measuring the combustion pressure and visualization of the combus- tion process. The plasma jet injector configuration and the ratio of methanol volume to cavity volume influence not only the plasma jet diffusive combustion process but also the maximum combustion pressure. In cases of small orifice diameter, the plasma jet diffusive combustion is not recognized, and the maximum combustion pres- sure increases as the orifice area becomes large. In the case of a little fuel being provided in the cavity, enough methanol to initiate and 234</page><page sequence="234">2001-01-1860-2001-01-1866 to continue the diffusive combustion is not included in the metha- nol-air mixture jet and diffusive combustion does not occur. In the case where most of the cavity is filled with methanol, the fuel mist is only ejected. In the case where appropriate methanol is supplied, the plasma jet diffusive combustion certainly occurs. 2001-01-1861. Study on electronic control of air-fuel ratio and ignition timing for small gasoline engine. Masatake Yoshida, Takashi Suzuki, and Yasufumi O guri, Sophia Univ.; and Wu Bin, Zhou Dasen, Song Shuying, and Li Xinghu, Beijing Polytechnic Univ. The electronic-controlled carburetor and ignition system has been developed. In accordance with various working conditions of the engine, the system adjusted corresponding control parameters; air-fuel ratio and ignition timing, therefore it could keep the engine working on the optimal conditions. Through analyzing overall per- formance of the engine based on the experimental data, we had con- cluded that the specific fuel consumption was improved about 8-10%, and the exhaust emission performance was improved corre- spondingly after electronic control, the improved ratio was about 10% for HC emission and 97% for CO emission. 2001-01-1862. Dell'Orto electronic carburetor. P. Dell'Orto, G. Berlusconi, and P. Colombo, INC Dell'Orto SpA - Italy. A smart way to control A/F mixture ratio in small utility engines is needed to meet future emission standards and to improve fuel economy. Dell'Orto proposes a novel carburation technology, that joins an effective way to vary A/F mixture with a closed-loop elec- tronic control strategy. The electronic carburetor is able to control A/F mixture ratio in the lean combustion range, improving both emission and fuel economy. The mixture formation control is achieved by meaning of a sole- noid valve on a main air bleed circuit. An electronic controller is used to drive the solenoid valve, according to the engine operating conditions. The test engine used is a four-stroke, air-cooled, single-cylinder OHV engine with CDI ignition and mechanical speed governor. The control strategy is based on engine speed monitoring. The system normally forces the mixture on the lean side. An incipient lean mis- fire event is detected by cycle periods processing. When cycle-by- cycle deviation threshold is detected, then electronic controller forces the mixture to go back to the rich side, for the better combus- tion. Then, the system returns again to control the mixture in the lean range. By adjusting the control parameters, a lean and stable running is achieved. Results on SAE J1088 six mode test cycle shows a strong reduction in fuel consumption as well as in the HCs and CO emissions. The system detects directly the lean boundary condition, and thus it's self adaptive to the various operating conditions such as altitude, wears, filter clogging, carbon deposits, tolerances, climatic condi- tions, fuels and so on. After start and transient behavior are also improved, since the system control A/F mixture according to the engine requirements. This new development is designed to simply replace the standard carburetors. No additional sensors are required. Electric power requirements for control unit and solenoid valve supply are very low. Furthermore, the final product concept is shown, reducing the system to one component by integrating die electronic controller. 2001-01-1863. Fuel injection system for a high-speed one- cylinder S.I. engine. Goran Almkvist, Tomas Karlsson, Styrbjörn Gren, Jörgen Bengtsson, Conny Andersson, and Peter Oskarsson, SEM AB. Future exhaust emission legislation for small engines, used on motorcycles and leisure products, will make it necessary for small engine manufacturers to follow the same path in engine develop- ment as car manufacturers have done. Using the approach of con- verting an automotive system to a one-cylinder motorcycle engine application will result in severe disadvantages due to the large dif- ferences in physical behavior between the engine types. In the paper here presented, an Engine Management System, SEM Direct, was developed with the demands of extreme applica- tions like motocross, enduro, and off-road in the forefront. A solution to the pressure detection problem has been developed, and has been shown to accurately predict engine load. An adaptive function of the throttle position signal was devel- oped to keep the throttle signal correct at small opening areas. Immediate response control has been achieved by a combination of throttle detection, fast inlet pressure update, and an advanced fuel injection strategy. A one-cylinder-engine's sensitivity to wall wetting effects prob- lem is solved by using a dual injection strategy together with an advanced fuel film compensation algorithm. The result is an engine control system for one- and two-cylinder engines used in high demanding applications, that is able to combine response, low emissions and driveability. The max engine performance can be improved by a higher free- dom in inlet tuning design. 2001-01-1864. Staged fuel injection with in-line pumps: Sim- ulation and experiments. G. L. Berta, P. Casoli, and A. Vacca, University of Parma. It is well known that the combustion development in diesel engines is strongly dependent on the injected fuel rate versus crank angle. In the last few years new technologies for controlling the injection rate have been developed and tested; many researchers have investigated the effect of split injection on both particulate and NOx emissions. For small diesel engines electronically controlled injection systems have too high incidence on the final costs. In this paper, a mechanical injection system is presented that takes advantage of a modified in-line pump in order to achieve a two-stage injection. Tests have been carried out by means of an atmospheric test rig for the fuel injection system. The experimental results confirm that the two-stage injection occurs when utilizing the modified pump. A computer code, developed by the authors, has been used in order to simulate the modified injection system; the model worked out to be very useful to determine the geometrical features of the pump. 2001-01-1865. ECU development and testing through numer- ical optimization and hardware in the loop simulations. Boatto Paolo, Monacchia Stefano, and Vieri Giovanbattista, Ent S. r. I. ; and Alessandro Trifiletti, Università La Sapienza. A method to speed up and improve die whole development cycle of Electronic Control Units (ECU) is presented. The proposed procedure can be divided into three steps: develop- ment and validation of the controlled system dynamic model; numerical optimization of the system control strategy; and Hard- ware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulations to test the electronic control unit. Implementation of the method has led to the creation of a hard- ware-in-the-loop system aimed at testing the control unit of elec- tronically controlled transmissions. The system includes a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) board where the dynamic model runs and a console allowing the user to operate the throttle and brake pedals and to actuate the gearshifts. The behavior of the model can be visu- alized through a real-time Graphical User Interface (GUI) on a PC connected with the DSP board by a serial link. 2001-01-1866. Development of high reliability and low-cost electronic governor system for small diesel engine for agricul- tural and industrial use. Hajime Yama, Masanori Fujiwara, Yasuo Fujii, and Toshio Nakahira, Kubota Corp. The latest frequency-conversion system, as typified by inverter power generator, is capable of providing superb ftiel economy and NVH characteristics by means of real-time control of the engine speed according to its load condition. The current mechanical gover- 235</page><page sequence="235">2001-01-1866-2001-01-1872 nor, however, can with difficulty achieve that demand of perfor- mance. In order to meet these requirements, we have developed the electronic governor system having high control flexibility and response for small diesel engines for agricultural and industrial use. In developing this electronic governor system, we have adopted a method that can minimize modification of current engines. We have successfully developed the electronic governor system by means of a post-assembly installation, in which dedicated functional devices are installed to complete engine while keeping intact the current highly reliable PFR-type fuel-injection pump and the mechanical governor. This method allows the electronic governor to control engine speed within the limit of fuel-delivery quantity regulated by the mechanical governor. It means that the full load fuel-delivery characteristic curve is unaffected by the installation of the electronic governor, and that the emission performance attained with the mechanical governor is also unchanged. In order to perfect this post-assembly installation method, we have newly developed the actuator having compatibility with the current engine stop solenoid, as well as the injection quantity sensor having compatibility with start spring assembly. These functional devices have high reliability adaptable to harsh operational environ- ment typical of agricultural and industrial engine applications. We have combined these devices with the Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which has the reliability well proven in our current in-house production, in order to cope with diverse applications of these engines. This electronic governor system offers the choice of two types according to the performance requirements of equipment. One is the basic-type electronic governor system that has no injection quantity sensor and operates only in the isochronous mode that works to keep the constant engine speed. Another is the high-precision-type elec- tronic governor system that can operate not only in the isochronous mode but also in the droop mode, the characteristics of mechanical governor, and in the inverse-droop mode that increases engine speed to make the torque follow the load fluctuations at low speed range. 2001-01-1867. Dynamic analysis of a 4-stroke scooter exhaust system using FEM. N. Jayaram and R. B. Anand, TVS-Suzuki Ltd. Proving of an exhaust system design against structural failures has always been a great challenge in a new 4-stroke scooter develop- ment. Also the development time of exhaust system is dependent on how quickly we solve the failure problems. The design has to take care of both static &amp; dynamic failures. However, the experience of previous failures clearly indicates the chief cause as resonance tak- ing place in the speed range of the vehicle. Finite element (FE) model of the first proposal is made using the Solid models available. The natural frequencies are extracted from the FE model consisting of shell, beam &amp; mass elements. The design of exhaust mounting bracket is found to be crucial in manipulating the frequencies. The physical prototype is made and the natural fre- quencies are found experimentally. These are compared with the FE-predicted Eigen values. The FE model is fine tuned to match the predicted natural frequencies with the measured ones. The validated FE model is used to try various design options for mounting bracket, tube thickness etc., to achieve the desired fre- quency pattern. Ideally, optimal design is the one where the first nat- ural frequency does not fall in the speed range of the Scooter. How- ever, this is quite impossible to achieve in most of the practical cases. Alternatively, the optimal design is achieved by placing the natural frequencies at non-critical speeds. This manipulation has become much more difficult in 4-stroke Scooter, as the excitation comes from both rotational &amp; firing frequencies. Incidentally, the firing frequency is half of the rotational frequency in case of 4-stroke engines. After no. of iterations using FE models, optimal frequency pat- tern is achieved. The prototype is made and tested both in laboratory &amp; road under actual usage conditions as well as extreme conditions. As there are no failures observed in these tests, the pattern of fre- quencies proposed also got validated. Subsequently, when the exhaust system is redesigned for performance requirements, the bracket is redesigned achieving the same proven frequency pattern using FE analysis. The new prototype is only tested to verify the measured frequencies with the predicted ones. This design is then productionized, without going through extensive test procedures. Thus, the total development time for the exhaust system has been considerably reduced due to the systematic analysis done using FEM. 2001-01-1868. Study on the vibration of motorcycle muffler system. J. Suwa , K. Hokari , M. Oda , T. Kaneda, and S. Kataoka , Kawasaki Heavy Industries , Ltd. Motorcycle engines are operated at an extremely broad range of revolutions, from 1,000 min"1 to 10,000 min"1 or more. Ideally, the natural frequency of each part should never match the engine excita- tion frequency at any point over that entire range of revolution speeds, but practically, there are times when resonance cannot be avoided because the range is so broad, and therefore the vibration amplitude at resonance must be kept low. For this reason, it is important to grasp not only the resonance frequency but also the vibration amplitude at that point. This may be achieved by two methods, measurement and analysis. The direct measurement of vibration is generally difficult because the motorcycle muffler sys- tem has a complex shape and in addition it gets very high tempera- ture when the engine is operating. For this reason, with the aim of being able to predict muffler vibration at the design stage, we carried out a vibration test and FEM (finite element method) analysis. First, we carried out an experimen- tal modal analysis of the muffler attached to the motorcycle and obtained the natural frequency and the vibration mode. The vibra- tion amplitude at resonance when the engine was operating was measured with a Laser Doppler Vibrometer. Secondary, the muffler system was modeled with 3D (three- dimensional) beam elements to analyze by FEM. Boundary condi- tions were determined by applying actually measured data. Thirdly, the FEM model was corrected by comparing calculated results with experimentally obtained data. In this way, we studied the FEM mod- elling technology required to predict vibration of motorcycle muf- fler system. 2001-01-1870. Reducing vibration of a 2-cylinder outboard motor by the pendulum motion mount method. Kazuyuki Shiomi, Takeshi Okada , Michiharu Ohkawa , and Tetsuro Ikeno, Honda R&amp;D Co. y Ltd. In order to reduce the vibration of the 4-stroke 2-cylinder out- board motor, the vibration of the outboard motor was analyzed theo- retically. By using a 2-dimensional kinetic model, the equation of motion was obtained. Vibration acceleration at handle and the exci- tation forces to the hull were described by solving these equations. Through this analysis, the theory of isolating vibration by the pendu- lum motion mount method is established by finding the design con- dition which isolates vibration effectively. The method was applied to the design of the outboard motor. The mount location was opti- mized to minimize vibration, and the mount structure was designed for endurance. The body of the outboard motor was designed to opti- mize its vibratory characteristics in order to avoid resonance. Exper- imental verification of the newly developed 4-stroke 2-cylinder small outboard motor revealed that the effectiveness of vibration reduction was equal to, or better than, that of the outboard motor equipped with a lst-order balancer. 2001-01-1872. Thermal analysis of high-power hybrid elec- tronic circuits for motorbike regulators. Paolo Emilio Bagnoli, Università di Pisa; Emilio Franchi, Mitsuba F.N.Europe; and Ste- fano Di Pascoli, Università di Pisa. This paper deals with the experimental characterization of the thermal properties of a power hybrid electronic circuit used for motorbike electrical power regulation. The main power devices were MOS transistors mounted in 'naked chip' configuration. These 236</page><page sequence="236">2001-01-1872-2001-01-1879 devices suffered for an abnormal over-heating, causing the system failure, due to unsuitable heat dissipation capabilities of the assem- bling structure. The thermal characterization was carried out by means of the TRAIT (Thermal Resistance Analysis by Induced Transient) method based on the careful analysis of the device tem- perature cooling transients. This technique is able to measure the thermal resistance as a sum of several contributions due to the vari- ous parts of the system, so that it possible to localize within the assembling structure the sources of heat conduction impediments. Several measurements, carried out on samples mounted on allumina and insulated aluminum substrates, clearly indicated the thin Sn-Pb soldering layer, between the die and the top metal pads, as the main responsible for the thermal resistance high values. Unsuitable solder deposition and annealing methods probably caused the incomplete removal of the organic matrix and the formation of a mixed metal- lic-dielectric layer with bad thermal conductivity. 2001-01-1873. The influence of body layout on vehicle pitch- ing behavior in ATV (part 1). Masanori Yoshihara, Yamaha Motor Co ., Ltd. This paper intends to verify the following in order to clarify the influence of the body layout on ATV pitching behavior, and for the purpose of helping develop a more pleasing product, it reports the research results based on the theory and experiment concerning the effect of body geometry on vehicle dynamics, with particular emphasis on vehicle behaviors under acceleration and deceleration. A discussion of vehicles employing the chain drive or swing arm system involves a number of factors that contribute to pitching motion. Such factors can be roughly divided into two effects. One effect arises from a load transfer in every vehicle due to the inertial force acting on sprung mass, and the other is the force that is acti- vated by a chain drive and a swing arm system and thus demands geometrical consideration. In an attempt to grasp an accurate pitch- ing behavior in relation to the vehicle geometry during acceleration, we first made a theoretical inference about the behavior and then conducted a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of it on actual vehicles. In view of few changes in the line of action due to suspen- sion geometry, we made a theoretical calculation using the value in the case of a 1G behavior for the sake of simplicity. As a result of comparison of this behavior with acceleration and deceleration behaviors on actual vehicles, we were able to find a good qualitative and quantitative conformity in the acceleration behavior. We were also able to find a qualitative conformity in the deceleration behavior. 2001-01-1874. The moris motorcycle simulator: An overview. D. Ferrazzin, F. Salsedo, F. Barbagli , C. A. Avizzano, G. Di Pietro , A. Br ogni, M. Vignoni , and M. Bergamasco , P ERC RO; and L. Arnone , M. M arc acci, L. Masut , and A. Benedetti , Piaggio &amp; C. Many motion-based simulators have been developed in the last thirty years for many different types of vehicles. In order to make a simulation more realistic, linear accelerations and angular rates are exerted on the pilot by moving the platform on which the mock-up vehicle is located. The purpose of this article is to present a 7 DOFs (vertical, lateral and longitudinal displacements, roll, pitch and yaw angles and steer) motorcycle simulator which has been realized in Pisa, Italy, in the framework of the Esprit project by a consortium composed by industrial partners (Piaggio and Humanware from Italy and HEAD acoustics from Germany) and by academic partners (Scuola Superi- ore S. Anna from Italy, Halmstad University from Sweden and Uni- versity of Bochum from Germany). Such project started in 1995 with the aim of developing a two- wheeled motorcycle simulator conceived as a tool for the designer to acquire data on motorcycle handling and stability at the design stage as well as to collect data about rider control behavior implica- tions in motorcycle performances. 2001-01-1875. Setup and validation for a simulation of a scooter comfort bench. R. Hippoliti, Piaggio &amp; C. S.p.A .; and M. Carfagni , M. Pierini, and D. Caprioli, Florence Univ. This research activity was developed in order to build an innova- tive analytical model of a two wheels vehicle for the simulation of a comfort test bench. This model should predict the reaction forces transmitted between the vehicle and the rider in the interface points (grip handles, saddleback, footrest). An FEM modelization of a Piaggio' s scooter (Hexagon 180cc, 2 strokes) mainframe and its accessories was performed and vali- dated experimentally through a modal eigenvalues and shapes com- parison (MAC). Furthermore a multibody system of the rear suspen- sion was developed, describing the whole vehicle with both flexible and rigid bodies. The dynamic behavior of this suspension system was validated experimentally (since a test bench was realized) in both the cases of a shaker excitation and of the engine running at different speeds (2500/3500 rpm). The final aim was to obtain a good agreement in the comparison between the experimental results and the virtual simulation of the scooter running on a comfort test bench. This useful methodology could be used in order to predict, from the early design stage, the ride comfort of a scooter. 2001-01-1876. Subjective assessment and objective measure- ment of handling maneuvers in two-wheeled vehicles. G. Arcidiacono and R. Capitani, University of Florence; and R. Hip- politi, Piaggio &amp; C. SpA. This paper reviews an approach to make the assessment of a two- wheeled vehicle's handling characteristics objective. The traditional approach to the development of good handling properties is based on the subjective evaluations of skilled test drivers. The object of this study is to define semi-empirical mutual relations which are able to associate a Handling Quality Index (HQI) with a combina- tion of determinate mechanical quantities obtained experimentally. In essence the methodology used to describe behavior such as handling in terms of sensory perception, has relied on a comparison of opinions provided by test-drivers and the result of experimental data pertaining to mechanical quantities such as forces, displace- ments, torques and rotations measured during standard maneuvers considered significant. In order to get this correlation, the Genetic Algorithm technique was used as optimization method. The importance of this standardized method for evaluating vehi- cle's handling behavior is that it allows to investigate the effects of particular vehicle design features and it is suitable for computer simulation. 2001-01-1879. Factors in the mechanical design of motorcycle laboratory test systems. Paul Carroll and Stuart Carver, MTS Sys- tems Corp. This paper presents a process for defining the mechanical param- eters of laboratory test systems used in evaluating durability and performance properties of motorcycle chassis, subassemblies, and components. The foundation for productive lab-based testing is the proper design of mechanical fixtures, reaction elements, and servo- hydraulic components. When designed correctly as a system, they will recreate the desired operating environment on the specimen. Only when this specimen-operating environment is accurately simu- lated through good mechanical design will the test engineer and design engineer have the means to measure useful response data for test control and analysis. This paper also reviews how to establish clear test objectives on which the mechanical design is based. Criteria are given for the design of two types of test setups. The first type includes self- reacted tests, which are typically used for component-level testing. The second type includes inertially reacted tests, which are typically used for full vehicles. 237</page><page sequence="237">2001-01-1880-2001-01-1887 2001-01-1880. The effect of intake air temperature, compres- sion ratio and coolant temperature on the start of heat release in an HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition) engine. M. Iida, Yamaha Motor Co.; and T. Aroonsrisopon , M. Hayashi , D. Foster , and J. Martin , University of Wisconsin - Madison. In this paper, effect of intake air temperature, coolant tempera- ture, and compression ratio on start of heat release (SOHR) in HCCI engines is investigated. The operational range with HCCI operation was determined experimentally using a CFR (Cooperative Fuels Research) engine with n-butane as the fuel. In-cylinder pressure was processed to evaluate SOHR. The effect of intake air and coolant temperature on SOHR increases as engine speed increases. In order to gain more insight into the combustion phenomena, SOHR was calculated using the theory of Livengood-Wu and compared with the experimental data. Dependence of SOHR on the equivalence ratio shows good correspondence between experiment and calcula- tion. On the contrary, dependence on the intake air temperature and compression ratio shows poorer correspondence with predictions, especially under low engine speed. We interpret this as an indication of the importance of the active intermediate species that remain in the combustion chamber. 2001-01-1881. Study on the process of backfiring. Shinji Saito and Masaya Adachi, Honda R&amp;D Co ., Ltd. It has been considered that a backfire occurs due to such a phe- nomenon that the ignition at the overlap top dead center or the reversing of the hot burnt mixture during the valve-overlapping period triggers ignition. We have recently determined that there is a different type of ignition source that cannot be explained by the conventional theories. That is, there is an extremely slow burning cycle that continu- ously burns even at the exhaust stroke. That extremely slow burning lasts even after the exhaust stroke and ignites the fresh mixture dur- ing the following intake stroke, causing a backfire. In this study, we clarified procedures of the extremely slow burning that serves as a source of ignition to trigger a backfire by the pressure measurements at the intake and exhaust ports and visualizing the phenomena with the high-speed CCD camera. In this article we report the outlines along with the considerations on the factors that affect the extremely slow burning cycle. 2001-01-1882. An analysis of light emission intensity behav- ior corresponding to intermediate products in different places of the combustion chamber. Hironori Ohara, Junichi Ogawa, Koji Yoshida, Hideo Shoji, and Atsushi Saima, Nihon Univ. Knocking is one phenomenon that can be cited as a factor imped- ing efforts to improve the efficiency of spark-ignition engines. With the aim of understanding knocking better, light emission spectros- copy was applied in this study to examine preflame reactions that can be observed prior to autoignition in the combustion reaction pro- cess of hydrocarbon fuels. Attention was focused on light emission behavior at wavelengths corresponding to those of formaldehyde (HCHO), Vaidya's hydrocarbon flame band (HCO) and the OH rad- ical in a forced progression from normal combustion to a knocking state. Light emission behavior was measured simultaneously in the center and in the end zone of the combustion chamber when the engine was operated on two different test fuels. The test fuels used were n-heptane (0 RON) and a blended fuel (70 RON) consisting of n-heptane (0 RON) and iso-octane (100 RON). With n-heptane (0 RON) as the test fuel, behavior corresponding to the passage and degeneracy of a cool flame was observed. When the blended fuel (70 RON) was used, a tendency was observed for the preflame reac- tion interval of HCHO to become longer as combustion progressed from a normal state to trace knocking. As a result of analyzing the experimental data, the degree to which the preflame reactions observed in the end zone of the combustion chamber were influ- enced by flame propagation was confirmed quantitatively. 2001-01-1884. Development of 7003 aluminum extrusions for motorcycle frame applications. Rowdy Jospeh, Honda R&amp;D Americas, Inc.; and Junichi Ueda, Honda R&amp;D Company, Ltd. The 7003-T4 alloy has been developed for production of motor- cycle frame bodies. The developed material has been applied to the 2001 Goldwing motorcycle recently introduced to the world market. During the material development, a designed experiment was planned by which nine 7003 alloy variants were cast and homoge- nized. The cast billets were extruded into hollow frame tubes on a production extrusion line and the natural aging response of the mate- rial was evaluated. The tendency for recrystallized grains at the sur- face of the extruded tubes was measured and confirmed to be at an acceptable level for painting. The reversion and recovery of mechanical properties during paint curing was evaluated and curing limits were established for mass production. From the results, para- metric equations were derived to describe the relationships between mechanical properties, composition and natural aging time to insure design compliance. This development has resulted in a frame which is 35% lighter than the tubular steel construction applied to previous models. 2001-01-1885. Development of new coloring method using air oxidation for silencer body in titanium. Naohisa Takahashi and Shuhei Adachi, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. The silencer body is required to a function of noise reduction, design component and lightweight. Recently use of titanium is get- ting popular for mass production exhaust parts of a motorcycle. And the titanium is required to be colored for the sophisticated appear- ance. Although titanium can be commonly colored by anodizing, the anodic oxide film shows discoloration at elevated temperature and to the direct rays of the sun. Yamaha has developed a new air oxidation method by which an impressive blue-colored surface can be obtained. A first coating of ceramics and the glass is performed on the surface of silencer body. Then it is put into the air oxidation process and the surface color turns to blue. The color does not show any discoloration either at high temperature or under strong sunrays. In this study the manufacturing procedure will be described and relationship between the structure of oxide film and manufacturing parameters will be discussed based on the investigation result of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA), and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES)analysis. The silencer body colored by this new procedure has been suc- cessively applied to the super sports motorcycle since March 2000. 2001-01-1886. Applying hard thin coatings to tappets to reduce friction. A. Kodai, T. Mori, and T. Inukai, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. In a motorcycle engine, the tappets convert the rotating motion of the cams to the pitching motion of the valves, and they slide with the cams at a high speed under high pressure. Reducing the friction between the tappets and the cams would increase the power of the engine. We studied a way to reduce the coefficient of friction between tappets and cams by applying a hard thin coating of DLC, M0S2, CrN, or TiN to the tappets. We investigated the adhesion of the coat- ings with a scratch test and their tribological properties with a ball- on-disk test. We then examined their durability with an engine stand test. We concluded that a tappet coated with DLC effectively reduces friction at the cam and tappet interface and is sufficiently durable to be applied to actual motorcycle engines. 2001-01-1887. Study on the life cycle assessment application to motorcycles. Yoshihiko Tatemichi and Takeshi Yoshida, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. 238</page><page sequence="238">2001-01-1887-2001-01-1892 Studies have been made of the standardization of implementation procedures of the life cycle assessment (LCA), standardized as ISO 14040 series, under the joint collaboration of industries, govern- ment agencies and universities. A life cycle inventory (LCI) of motorcycles, cases of research of whose LCA are scarce, has been attempted by taking infrastructures of Japan into consideration. Energy-saving property 'as mobility of motorcycles' was verified by building up a practical macro LCI method covering the stages of the life cycle of motorcycles. Furthermore, in the development of aluminum die-cast frames for scooters, micro LCI was performed for manufacturing stages to quantify the environmental advantage of fully utilizing recycled materials and clarify problematical points in the design of new mate- rials. This proved that LCA method is effective for the selection of optimum materials and optimum manufacturing plans. 2001-01-1888. Development of water pump case by ultrasonic soldering. Gouki Yotsuya and Toshio Yamauchi, Suzuki Motor Co. An ultrasonic soldering process was developed for manufacture of a compact and lightweight water pump case for sport-utility motorcycles. Most standard water pump cases consist of an alumi- num pump case and a steel pipe brazed to a steel flange. Conven- tional joint method of an aluminum pump case to a steel pipe is by bolting. Our modified ultrasonic soldering succeeded in joining an aluminum pump case and a steel pipe without any flange or bolt. Also by adopting an oval joint shape, the water pump case became more compact and has been produced with elimination of 4 parts. Its weight was lessened by approximately 16% from the previous one. It has been considered difficult to join steel and aluminum because of the formation of fragile intermetallic compounds. We prevented, however, the formation of intermetallic compounds by ultrasonic soldering. We verified that water pump cases joined to a steel pipe by ultra- sonic soldering have excellent joint strength and high reliability. The compact water pump cases were therefore employed in our new off-road sport-utility motorcycles. 2001-01-1889. Optimization of welding parameters in a motor vehicle steering tube using experimental design method- ology. G. Arcidiacono and R. Capitani , University of Florence; and W. Ambrosini and G. Serrecchia , Honda Italia Industriale SpA. The objective of this paper is to describe the optimization of welding parameters in a motor vehicle steering tube of the Honda scooters using Experimental Design methodology. In the first phase the main variables were defined, i.e., the factors (and the specific values related) influencing the welding process were chosen. Suc- cessively experimental runs were planned and carried out in two steps to refine the values (to reduce their variation range) of the fac- tor levels considered. To evaluate the quality of the welding a destructive Macrotest was carried out, namely a survey at both macrographic and micrographie levels to ascertain the homogeneity of the materials. In the case of welded joints Macrotest is used to ascertain whether the welding has, in fact, created a continuous and permanent union of the mechanical parts of a component. Use of the macrographic survey makes it possible to evaluate the depth of pen- etration of the welded joint in order to meet safety standards. The penetration depth constituted the response of the welding process considered. Using ANOVA it was possible to evaluate the more sig- nificant factors of the process. Once the influence of all the factors and their interactions are known it is possible to trace the Response Surfaces and the relative iso-level curves. This means the values of these factors can be quantified and consequently it is possible to optimize the system's productivity response. At the conclusion of this activity compression tests were carried out on the steering tubes so as to characterize the mechanical resistance of the welded joint. 2001-01-1890. (SP-1627) A review of experimental and simu- lation studies on controlled auto-ignition combustion. Nebojsa Milovanovic and Rui Chen, Loughborough Univ. Engines with controlled auto-ignition (CAI) combustion offer a number of benefits over conventional spark ignited (SI) and com- pression ignited (CI) engines, such as much lower NOx emission due to its relatively low combustion temperature, negligible cycle- to-cycle variation due to its self-ignition nature, higher combustion efficiency at part load than its SI counterpart, and low soot emis- sions since a homogeneous lean air/fuel mixture is being employed. Unlike conventional SI and CI engines, where combustion is directly controlled by the engine management system, the combus- tion in CAI engines is controlled by chemical kinetics only. Over the past two decades, a number of technologies have been developed to initiate such combustion on both 2- and 4- stroke engines with var- ious fuels, but none of them could maintain the combustion over the wide engine operation range. Remaining problems include control of ignition timing and the heat release rate over the entire engine operation range. This paper reviews some of the engine research results and available data from combustion kinetics studies. It has been observed that the quality of engine charge affects both ignition timing and the heat release rate of CAI combustion, but a certain charge temperature is essential to start the ignition of CAI combustion. 2001-01-1891. (SP-1627) Thermodynamic characteristics of premixed compression ignition combustions. Tadashi Tsurushima, Akira Harada, and Yuki Iwashiro, New ACE Institute Co., Ltd.; Yoshiteru Enomoto, Musashi Institute of Technology; and Yasuo Asaumi, and Yuzo Aoyagi, New ACE Institute Co., Ltd. Thermodynamic characteristics of premixed compression igni- tion combustions were clarified quantitatively by heat balance esti- mation. Heat balance was calculated from temperature, mole frac- tions of intake and exhaust gases, mass and properties of fuels. Heat balance estimation was conducted for three types of combustion; a conventional diesel combustion; a homogeneous charge compres- sion ignition (HCCI) combustion; fuel is provided and mixed with air in an intake pipe in this case, and an extremely early injection type PREmixed lean Diesel Combustion (PREDIC). The results show that EGR should be applied for premixed compression ignition combustion to complete combustion at lower load conditions and to control ignition timing at higher load conditions. With an applica- tion of EGR, both HCCI and PREDIC showed low heat loss charac- teristics at lower load conditions up to 1/2 load. HCCI + EGR showed the highest indicated thermal efficiency in all load condi- tions over 1/2 load, which is the high load operating limit of HCCI. The indicated thermal efficiency of PREDIC + EGR showed in the middle of HCCI and conventional diesel combustion. PREDIC still requires further optimization. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1892. (SP-1627) Premixed lean diesel combustion (PREDIC) using impingement spray system. Yoshiaki Nishijima, Yasuo Asaumi, and Yuzo Aoyagi, New ACE Institute Co., Ltd. Premixed lean Diesel Combustion (PREDIC) provides low NOx, however, it has some challenges associated with high HC emission, high fuel consumption and difficult timing control of compression ignition. To solve these problems, an impingement spray system with two injectors was tested to obtain positional controllability and larger volume of the air-fuel mixture formation in our previous study. The positional controllability means mainly the fuel mixture formation is the center of the cylinder with some space from the cyl- inder wall. The larger volume means the fuel mixture formation is leaner air-fuel mixture than that of free spray, which results in a pos- sibility of higher thermal efficiency. Thus, the impingement spray system has a possibility of HC reduction and fuel consumption improvement in PREDIC. 239</page><page sequence="239">2001-01-1892-2001-01-1898 In this study, we applied this system to PREDIC using a heavy- duty single-cylinder engine with two injectors to evaluate the effects of injection timing, boost pressure and injection pattern, etc. It has a possibility to reduce CO and HC by split injection pattern without increasing NOx. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1893. (SP- 1627) The effect of piston topland geome- try on emissions of unburned hydrocarbons from a homoge- neous charge compression ignition (HCCI). Magnus Christensen and Bengt Johansson , Lund Institute of Technology; and Anders Hultqvist, Scania CV. The effect of crevice volumes on the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons from a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine has been experimentally investigated. By varying the size and the geometry of the largest crevice, the piston topland, it was possible to ascertain whether or not crevices are the largest source of HC. Additionally, information on quenching distances for ultra-lean mixtures was obtained. The tests were performed on a sin- gle cylinder engine fuelled with iso-octane. The results showed that most of the unburned hydrocarbons descend from the crevices. Increasing the topland width to some degree lead to an increase in HC. A further increase in topland width (&gt;1.3 mm) resulted in a reduction of HC when using mixtures richer than X approximately equal to 2.8, indicating that some of the mix- ture trapped in the topland participates in the combustion. In condi- tions when combustion occurred in the topland, the HC was rather insensitive to the height of the topland. By opening up the topland, the HC emissions were in some cases reduced by over 50%. 2001-01-1894. (SP-1627) 1.9-liter four-cylinder HCCI engine operation with exhaust gas recirculation. Michael Y. Au, James W. Girard, and Robert Dibble, University of California ; Daniel Flowers, Salvador M. Aceves, Joel Martinez- Frias, and Ray Smith, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ; and Christian Seibel, and Ulrich Maas, Universität Stuttgart. We present the effect of EGR, at a set fuel flow rate and intake temperature, on the operating parameters of timing of combustion, duration of combustion, power output, thermal efficiency, and NOx emission; which is remarkably low. We find that addition of EGR at constant inlet temperature and constant fuel flow rate has little effect on HCCI parameter of start of combustion (SOC). However, burn duration is highly dependent on the amount of EGR inducted. The experimental setup at UC Berkeley uses a 1 .9-liter 4-cylin- der diesel engine with a compression ratio of 18.8:1 (offered on a 1995 VW Passat TDI). The engine was converted to run in HCCI mode by addition of an 18kW air pre-heater installed in the intake system. Pressure traces were obtained using four water-cooled quartz pressure transducers, which replaced the diesel fuel injectors. Gaseous fuel (propane or butane) flowed steadily into the intake manifold. 2001-01-1895. (SP-1627) Operation of a four-cylinder 1.9 1 propane-fueled homogeneous charge compression ignition engine: Basic operating characteristics and cylinder-to-cylinder effects. Daniel Flowers, Salvador M. Aceves, Joel Martinez- Frias, and J. Ray Smith, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ; and Michael Au, James Girard, and Robert Dibble, University of Cali- fornia. A four-cylinder 1.9 Volkswagen TDI Engine has been converted to run in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode. The stock configuration is a turbo-charged direct injection diesel engine. The combustion chamber has been modified by dis- carding the in-cylinder diesel fuel injectors and replacing them with blank inserts (which contain pressure transducers). The stock pis- tons contain a reentrant bowl and have been retained for the tests reported here. The intake and exhaust manifolds have also been retained, but the turbocharger has been removed. A heater has been installed upstream of the intake manifold and fuel is added just downstream of this heater. The performance of this engine in naturally aspirated HCCI oper- ation, subject to variable intake temperature and fuel flow rate, has been studied. The engine has been run with propane fuel at a cons- tant speed of 1800 rpm. This work is intended to characterize the HCCI operation of the engine in this configuration that has been minimally modified from the base Diesel engine. The performance (BMEP, IMEP, efficiency, etc) and emissions (THC, CO, NOx) of the engine are presented, as are combustion process results based on heat release analysis of the pressure traces from each cylinder. 2001-01-1896. (SP-1627) A turbocharged dual-fuel HCCI engine. J an- Ola Ols son, Per Tune stal, Göran Haraldsson, and Bengt Johansson, Lund Institute of Technology. A 6-cylinder truck engine is modified for turbocharged dual-fuel Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine opera- tion. Two different fuels, ethanol and n-heptane, are used to control the ignition timing. The objective of this study is to demonstrate high load operation of a full-size HCCI engine and to discuss some of the typical constraints associated with HCCI operation. This study proves the possibility to achieve high loads, up to 16 bar Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP), and ultra-low NOx emissions, using turbo charging and dual fuel. Although the system shows great potential, it is obvious that the lack of inlet air pre heating is a draw- back at low loads, where combustion efficiency suffers. At high loads, the low exhaust temperature provides little energy for turbo- charging, thus causing pump losses higher than for a comparable diesel engine. Design of turbocharger therefore, is a key issue in order to achieve high loads in combination with high efficiency. In spite of these limitations, brake thermal efficiencies and power rat- ing close to those of the original diesel engine are achieved with sig- nificant reduction in NOx emissions. The maximum efficiency is 41.2%, which is slightly lower than for the original diesel engine. 2001-01-1897. (SP-1627) HCCI operation of a dual-fuel natu- ral gas engine for improved fuel efficiency and ultra-low NOx emissions at low-to-moderate engine load. Rudolf H. Stanglmaier, Thomas W. Ryan III, and Jason S. Souder, Southwest Research Institute. A new combustion concept has been developed and tested for improving the low-to-moderate load efficiency and NOx emissions of natural gas engines. This concept involves operation of a dual- fuel natural gas engine on Homogeneous Charge Compression Igni- tion (HCCI) in the load regime of idle up to 35 % of the peak torque. A dual-fuel approach is used to control the combustion phasing of the engine during HCCI operation, and conventional spark-ignited natural gas combustion is used for the high-load regime. This con- cept has resulted in an engine with power output and high-load fuel efficiency that are unchanged from the base engine, but with a 10 - 15% improvement to the low-to-moderate load fuel efficiency. In addition, the engine-out NOx emissions during HCCI operation are over 90% lower than on spark-ignited natural gas operation over the equivalent load range. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1898. (SP- 1624) Oil quality with oil age in an IDI die- sel passenger car using an on-line lubricating oil recycler under real-world driving. Gordon E. Andrews and Jie Xu, University of Leeds ; M. H.

A method of cleaning lubricating oil on line was investigated using a fine 1 micron bypass particulate filter, followed by an infra- red heater to remove water and light diesel fractions in the oil. A Ford 1.8-liter IDI diesel passenger car was investigated under real- world driving conditions. Comparison was made with the oil quality without the recycler. All the tests were carried out on the same vehi- cle over 7000 miles with and without the recycler. The results showed that the on-line oil recycler cleaning system reduced the rate 240</page><page sequence="240">2001-01-1898-2001-01-1903 of reduction of TBN and the rate of increase of TAN by 54% and 50% respectively. The reduction in the rate of carbon accumulation in the oil was 42%. There was also a reduction in fuel dilution. All the wear metals in the oil were greatly reduced by the recycler, the iron was reduced by 76%, the lead was reduced by 85% and the alu- minum was totally removed. Compared with previous results from the same type of engine test using an oil recycler with 6 micron bypass filter, the 1 micron finer bypass filter was more effective in reducing wear metals. The recycler achieved an 8.9% reduction in fuel consumption. There was a 44% reduction in the oil consump- tion using the recycler. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1899. (SP- 1624) Lubricant requirements of an advanced designed high-performance, fuel-efficient low- emissions V-6 engine. Michael Batko and Dennis Florkowski, DaimlerChrysler Corp.; and Victoria Ebeling, Rolf Geibach, and Lewis Williams , Lubrizol Corp. Modern high-power-density gasoline-fueled engines place an ever-increasing demand on the engine lubricant. In this study, it is shown that advances in engine design to increase performance, improve fuel economy and lower emissions have outpaced the development of typical commercial engine lubricants. Advanced designed engines began to experience oil starvation as a result of a combination of driving cycles, oil quality and poor maintenance practices. The cause was traced to excessive increases in borderline pumping viscosity as measured by MRV TP-1 (ASTM D4684). Used oil analysis for MRV TP-1 showed viscosity greatly increased in excess of stay-in-grade requirements and in many cases the crank- case lubricant was solid at the temperature appropriate for its viscos- ity grade. However, at the same time CCS values were in grade or only slightly (1W grade) elevated. An investigation examining used oil showed high levels of oil oxidation and nitration to be the pri- mary forces at work in degrading the engine lubricant. Formulating solutions were investigated and the outcome of that work will be discussed. An aggressive field trial was conducted to show proof of performance of the optimized reformulated engine lubricants and the results are presented. Finally, there is discussion of further work to be conducted and a proposal for a new sequence test to address oxidation, nitration, piston deposits and pumpability for the next ILSAC category (GF-4). 2001-01-1900.

Illese oils resulted in 1.0-2.2% gains in combined fuel econ- omy (average 1.5%) over a typical GF-2 quality SAE 5W-30 oil. No significant gains in FE were observed during the cold transient por- tion of the FTP test. Engine oil temperatures were also reduced by 1-2°C with the SAE 5W-20 oils compared to the SAE 5W-30 oil. Of the two test oils, the one formulated with a Mo- type friction mod- ifier additive was about 0.5% more fuel-efficient than the one for- mulated with an organic-type FM additive. Of the two vehicles, the one with the inherently poorer FE performance showed higher gains (expressed as percent improvement in FE) with the SAE 5W-20 oils than the other vehicle. Potential carry-over FE effects were observed with the oil containing the organic-type FM additive, but these effects were not verified. 2001-01-1901. (SP-1624) Impact of lubricant oil on regulated emissions of a light-duty Mercedes-Benz OM611 CIDI-engine. Kent Froelund, Ed C. Owens , Ed Frame , and Janet P. Buckingham , Southwest Research Institute; John Garbak, Department of Energy; Spyros Tseregounis , General Motors Corporation R&amp;D; and Andrew Jackson , ExxonMobil R&amp;E. The Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle (PNGV) has iden- tified the compression-ignition, direct-injection (CIDI) engine as a promising technology in meeting the PNGV goal of 80 miles per gallon for a prototype mid-size sedan by 2004. Challenges remain in reducing the emission levels of the CIDI-engine to meet future emission standards. The objective of this project was to perform an initial screening of crank case lubricant contribution to regulated engine-out emissions, particularly when low-particulate-forming diesel fuel formulations are used. The test engine was the Mercedes- Benz OM611, the test oils were a mineral SAE 5W30, a synthetic (PAO based) SAE 5W30, and a synthetic (PAO based) SAE 15W50, and the test fuels were a California-like certification fuel and an alternative oxygenated diesel fuel. The most important findings were that for a low-speed, low-load condition representing real- world application of this light-duty engine, the particulate emissions had a statistically significant reduction of 18% by switching from a mineral SAE 5W30 oil to a higher- viscosity lower- volatility syn- thetic SAE 15W50 lube oil. However, the reduction in particulate emissions would be traded off against a statistically significant increase of 33% in nitric oxides emissions. This increase was cou- pled to the lube oil friction characteristics since the test was per- formed at constant torque. In order to obtain simultaneous reduction in particulate and nitric oxide emissions for a given SAE viscosity grade, it is important to decrease the lube oil volatility and the fric- tion characteristics through improvement of friction modifier additives. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1902. (SP-1624) Real-time transient and steady-state measurement of oil consumption for several production SI engines. Kent Froelund ', Southwest Research Institute; and Leandro A. Menezes , Hal R. Johnson , and Wolfgang O. Rein, MAHLE Tech- nology, Inc. Real-time transient and steady-state oil consumption were mea- sured on three SI engines, applying two different ring-packs to each engine. Testing of multiple engines enables an assessment of the engine-to-engine variability in oil consumption. Testing of multiple ring-packs on each engine enables an assessment of the ring-pack- to-ring-pack variability in oil consumption. The oil consumption was measured by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) novel developed S02-tracer technique, referred to as RTOC-III. An inter- esting finding is that the testing shows low engine-to-engine and ring-pack-to-ring-pack variability, in both steady-state, as well as in transient oil consumption. This suggests that the RTOC-III system did not introduce significant variability to the data. The testing results are experimental verification of a design and simulation exer- cise, in a field of scarcely published literature. 2001-01-1903. (SP-1624) Oil impacts on sequence VIB fuel economy. Alex B. Boffa and Satoshi Hirano, Chevron Oronite Co. The ASTM Sequence VIB is the new fuel economy standard for ILSAC GF-3. The new test pushes the bounds of current engine oil technology. With concerns over Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets, the auto manufacturers have been strong advocates of the Sequence VIB. This paper describes findings of some of fuel economy studies for GF-3. The Sequence VIB is a significant step relative to the past Sequence VIA test in requirements for friction control. Stage-by- stage analysis indicates a shift to a higher degree of 'mixed' lubrica- tion response in the Sequence VIB relative to the Sequence VIA, 35 % versus 11 %, making both optimized friction modification and viscosity control necessary for obtaining high levels of fuel econ- omy for GF-3. Viscometric contributions are controlled by both the (high temperature - high temperature) HTHS and basestock viscos- ity of the oil. Minimizing these viscometric measurements leads to improved fuel economy. Friction contributions are primarily depen- dent on friction modifier chemistry, although secondary impacts exist for detergent, dispersant, and zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). 241</page><page sequence="241">2001-01-1903-2001-01-1909 The other significant change for the Sequence VIB relative to the Sequence VIA is the addition of a fuel economy retention measure- ment. Relationships are explored between used oil properties and fuel economy retention. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1904. (SP- 1624) Predicting sequence VI, VIA, and VIB engine tests using laboratory methods. P. I. Lacey, Southwest Research Institute. Engine tests are widely used to measure the ability of lubricating oils to reduce fuel consumption through improved mechanical effi- ciency. Previous publications have correlated laboratory-scale tests with the well-established Sequence VI and VIA engine methods. The present paper uses a matrix of 66 oils to produce an empirical model for the recently developed Sequence VIB engine test. A smal- ler matrix of oils was available for correlation with Sequence VI and VIA results. The models combine a purposely designed friction test with conventional measures of kinematic and high-temperature high-shear viscosity. Good correlation was obtained with the Sequence VI, VIA and VIB results, as well as each of the five stages in the Sequence VIB test. The effects of lubricant oxidation in the 96-hour FEI-2 portion of the Sequence VIB test were similar for each of the oils. As a result, good correlation was observed between FEI-1 and FEI-2 results from the VIB test. 2001-01-1905. (SP-1624) The virtual engine test. Philip R. Scinto , Lubrizol Corp. In API engine oil licensing, a candidate oil must meet the perfor- mance requirements of category defined engine tests. The reason for the engine tests is to assess the capability of the candidate oil in field performance. Unfortunately, due to the time-consuming and expen- sive nature of most engine tests, a candidate oil is typically run only once or twice in an attempt to meet the performance requirements. Given that the results from most engine tests have large amounts of variability, the assessment of the candidate oil in several tests, although adequate, is obviously not perfect or inexpensive. The Virtual Engine Test is a process in which the time and expense of category defined engine tests may be reduced while maintaining, or even improving, the assessment of the candidate oil capability. In Virtual Testing, candidate oil performance is deter- mined, not by the test results in the physical engine test on that oil, but by an empirical model based upon test results generated in the engine test for similar oils. The empirical model, in other words, predicts candidate oil capability. The advantages of Virtual Tests include reduction in common and special cause variability, test time, and test expense in oil assessment. Several case studies and simulation examples are pres- ented that show how a Virtual Test has the potential to assess the capability of a candidate oil better than an actual engine test result. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1906. (SP-1624) Some statistical, technical, and prac- tical issues in virtual engine testing. Jim Rutherford , Chevron Oronite Company LLC. API's Engine Oil Licensing and Certification System has imple- mented Provisional Licensing in response to a shortage of parts for the Sequence HIE engine test. A Task Force delegated by the ASTM Sequence II/III Surveillance Panel was asked to develop a process, if appropriate, for the use of mathematical models as a substitute for the Sequence HIE engine test. The Task Force tried to develop a fair and technically justifiable system for predicting engine oil perfor- mance based on models derived from existing engine test databases. The situation appeared to some to be the ideal application for ini- tiating and proving a virtual test approach. In the end, others said the situation was too time-constrained or limited in scope. This paper describes some of the statistical, technical, and practi- cal issues involved in specifying a process for virtual testing. Some perspectives on these issues as discussed in the Task Force effort are explored. The goal for the paper is to provide a record of work as a possible stepping stone for future efforts to establish virtual test- ing for demonstrating engine oil performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1907. (SP- 1625) Analysis of combustion instability phenomena in a CNG-fueled heavy-duty turbocharged engine. L. Andreassi , S. Cordiner, and V. Rocco , Università di Roma (tTor Vergata and M. Gambino , and S. Iannaccone , Istituto Motori - CNR. The use of Compressed Natural Gas as an alternative fuel in urban transportation is nearly established and represents an efficient short-and medium-term solution to face with urban air pollution. However, in order to completely exploit its potential, the engine needs to be specifically designed to operate with this fuel. In the lat- est years, the authors have investigated the performances of a Heavy-Duty Turbocharged CNG-fuelled engine both experimen- tally and by using some analytical tools specifically developed by them which have been used for the engine optimization. In the pres- ent paper the simulation approach has been enlarged by means of a cooperative use of a CFD code and experimental analysis on the actual engine. The numerical simulation of combustion process has, in fact, been used, to interpret series of pressure cycles, aiming to analyze how cyclic fluctuations influence engine behaviour in terms of combustion efficiency and temperature and pollutant distribution. Combustion evolution has been simulated using an improved version of KTVA 3 V. To take properly into account one of the major sources of the combustion instability a detailed spark ignition and initial flame kernel formation model has been implemented in the fluid-dynamics 3D model. By varying the value of some input parameters in a stochastic manner around their measured values, it has been then possible to simulate series of pressure cycles with the same statistical properties of the measured ones. The obtained cycles have been then used to understand how the different pressure history, as observed for sequentially acquired pressure cycles, influ- ences the distribution of thermodynamic and physical variables and, consequently, the pollutant formation processes. 2001-01-1909. (SP- 1625) Characterization of mixture forma- tion in a direct-injected spark ignition engine. Katharina Schän- zlin and Thomas Koch , ETH Zurich; Alexios P. Tzannis, Paul Scher - rer Institute; and Konstantinos Boulouchos, ETH Zurich and Paul Scherrer Institute. We have performed simulations and experiments to characterize the mixture formation in spray-guided direct-injected spark ignition (DISI) gasoline engines and to help to understand features of the combustion process, which are characteristic for this engine con- cept. The 3-D computations are based on the KIVA 3 code, in which basic submodels of spray processes have been systematically modi- fied at ETH during the last years. In this study, the break-up model for the hollow-cone spray typical for DISI engines has been vali- dated through an extended comparison with both shadowgraphs and Mie-scattering results in a high-pressure-high-temperature, constant volume combustion cell at ambient conditions relevant for DISI operation, with and without significant droplet evaporation. Compu- tational results in a single-cylinder research engine have been then obtained at a given engine speed for varying load (fuel mass per stroke), swirl and fuel injection pressure. In parallel, a new endos- copic technique has been developed and implemented in the engine to provide optical information on the liquid phase distribution in the combustion chamber at different times after start of injection. Quite a good, at least qualitative, agreement has thereby been observed between computed and measured results with regard to liquid fuel penetration in the engine for all operating conditions investigated. A detailed comparison between simulation and experiments has revealed several of the underlying causes for the characteristic dependence of engine performance on the varying operating condi- tions. Among them the spray-induced turbulence intensity, the fuel evaporation rate, the degree of charge stratification, both in the vicinity of the spark-plug and globally in the combustion chamber 242</page><page sequence="242">2001-01-1909-2001-01-1916 at different times after start of injection (SOI), as well as their inter- playing with the air flow pattern have been identified as the most relevant parameters for this type of DISI engine combustion. The experimentally validated hollow cone spray break-up model can be now used to explore other system configurations for further optim- ization of the DISI mixture formation and combustion. 2001-01-1910. (SP- 1625) Measurements and modeling of residual gas fraction in SI engines. Hanseong Cho and Kwiyoung Lee , Institute for Advanced Engineering; Jonghwa Lee and Jaisuk Yoo, Ajou Univ.; and Kyoungdoug Min , Seoul National Univ. The residual gas in SI engines is one of important factors on emission and performance such as combustion stability. With high residual gas fractions, flame speed and maximum combustion tem- perature are decreased and there are deeply related with combustion stability, especially at Idle and NOx emission at relatively high engine load. Therefore, there is a need to characterize the residual gas fraction as a function of the engine operating parameters. A model for predicting the residual gas fraction has been formu- lated in this paper. The model accounts for the contribution due to the back flow of exhaust gas to the cylinder during valve overlap and it includes in-cylinder pressure prediction model during valve overlap. The model is derived from the one dimension flow process during overlap period and a simple ideal cycle model. The results showed that the residual gas fraction prediction model coincides well to the measured data over a wide range of engine operating condition such as intake pressure, air-fuel ratio, cam phasing and so on. This model can be used for calculating the residual gas fraction in cycle simulation and in engine heat release analysis. 2001-01-1911. (SP- 1625) ECUTEST- A real-time engine simulator for ECU development and testing. A. Boulat and Y. Genninasca, KADRA CONSULTANTS; and A. Charlet and P. Higelin, University of Orleans. In the last decade, the drastic strengthening of engine emission regulations has conducted the automotive industry towards more and more sophisticated engine control strategies requiring more and more sensor inputs and actuator outputs. The testing and setting up of the ECUs implementing such strategies becomes more and more difficult, requiring numerous engine tests on test benches. ECUTEST is a hardware and software package from KADRA CONSULTANTS that offers the following features: Simulation of sensors including variable reluctance sensor, lambda sensor, knock sensor... Measurement of output signals (injection, ignition, EGR...) timing and amplitude. A predefined test pattern can be replayed on the ECU to perform end of line testing. A real-time model can be used for testing and setting up embedded closed loop strategies. The present paper will cover the implementation of a real-time SI engine model on ECUTEST. The model has been developed using the Matlab/Simulink software package and Real Time Work- shop for building the real-time code. The model consists of several submodels: Intake manifold dynamics. Wall wetting dynamics. Crankshaft torque balance. Global engine characteristics (volumet- ric efficiency, MBT map, mechanical efficiency...). This model is representative enough to substitute to a real engine and connect to a modern ECU. In this case, even the closed loop strategies can be tested. Therefore, ECUTEST can be used to evalu- ate new strategies in the early stages of the development process, without the high cost of an engine test bench. 2001-01-1912. (SP- 1625) V order logarithmic polynomials for thermodynamic calculations in ICE. R. Lanzafame and M. Mes- sina , University of Catania. It is well-known that the reliability of calculations in ICEs depends on the accuracy of gases thermodynamic properties model. Several relationships modeling the composition of unburned and burned mixtures have been developed for computer use. In this paper, the authors have determined new relationships suit- able also for ICEs applications, in order to calculate the enthalpy for various gases, and mixtures. These relationships can be used in the models describing the pro- cesses of intake, compression, combustion and expansion, to simu- late a complete engine cycle and to foresee engine performance. These relationships have the functional form of a 'V order Loga- rithmic Polynomial,' and they can be used in temperature range of practical interest. 2001-01-1913. (SP- 1625) Higher accuracy through combining of quasi-3D (instead of ID) with true-3D manifold flow models during the simulation of ICE gas exchange processes. Victor Gheorghiu, University of Applied Sciences. So far the simulation of the gas exchange, air/fuel mixture forma- tion and burning processes in ICE was usually done, for cost rea- sons, by a combination of ID models for the intake and exhaust manifold and 3D models for the cylinder. In order to implement the modeling of the pipe flow more exactly, and also economically at the same time, a new method is presented here, called the quasi-3D method. After the presentation of the theoretical basis and the detailed description of the modeling technique, the quasi-3D method for one- cylinder research engine is applied. The simulation results of this application are compared with pressure measurements, followed by an evaluation and discussion of their accuracy. 2001-01-1914. (SP- 1625) Development of PEMS models for predicting NOx emissions from large bore natural gas engines. Michele Steyskal , Daniel Olsen , and Bryan Willson, Colorado State Univ. In this work two different Parametric Emissions Monitoring Sys- tem (PEMS) models are developed, an algebraic, semi-empirical model and a neural network model. The semi-empirical model is based on general relationships between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions and engine parameters. The neural network model utilizes a similar set of input parameters, but relies on the neural network code to determine the relationships between input parameters and measured NOx emissions. Two sets of data are used for model devel- opment. The first set is composed of typical engine parametric varia- tions and is used to train the models. The second set is used to test the models and is composed of changes to engine operation associ- ated with engine degradation, termed Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) issues. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1915. Challenges in reforming gasoline: All compo- nents are not created equal. John P. Kopasz, Shabbir Ahmed, and Michael Krumpelt, Argonne National Laboratory ; and Peter Dev- lin, U.S. DOE. Gasoline is a complex fuel. Many of the constituents of gasoline that are beneficial for the internal combustion engine (ICE) are expected to be challenging for on-board reformers in fuel-cell vehi- cles. To address these issues, the autothermal reforming of gasoline and individual components of gasoline has been investigated. The results indicate that aromatic components require higher tempera- tures and longer contact times to reform than paraffinic components. Napthenic components require higher temperatures to reform, but can be reformed at higher space velocities than paraffinic compo- nents. The effects of sulfur are dependent on the catalyst. These results suggest that further evolution of gasoline could reduce the demands on the reformer and provide a better fuel for a fuel-cell vehicle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1916. Flow resistance and capacity losses by the stor- age of natural gas on activated carbon. Carolina Cabello Tobar and Roger Sierens, Ghent Univ. 243</page><page sequence="243">2001-01-1916-2001-01-1921 During the last years, natural gas is increasingly used as an alter- native fuel for internal combustion engines, mainly because of the concern for the environment and the high gasoline prices. Natural gas can be stored by liquefaction, compression, or adsorption. When it is used in vehicles, natural gas is usually stored as compressed natural gas, (CNG), at pressures of about 20 MPa. Reducing the storage pressure is interesting as the energy necessary for compression is strongly reduced, the filling stations become less expensive and the necessary safety regulations are less stringent. With the adsorption of natural gas on activated carbon (ANG), the storage pressure is reduced to 5 MPa or less, and the designers get more freedom in tank design. In this paper, first an overview is given of the adsorption and desorption process and of the filling and emptying procedures of the tank. The equations of the isotherms are analyzed and extended for multi-component adsorption (guard bed). The compressibility effects are also considered. The flow resistance within the adsorbent is examined (modified Darcy equation). Tests are carried out on a flow bench to obtain the correct Darcy coefficients. Results of the amount of delivered gas are shown in function of the temperature and pressure in the tank. The pressure and temperature differences within the tank as well as the temperature difference between the tank and the surroundings cause a significant lost of capacity compared to the ideal case of iso- thermal filling and emptying. Therefore a detailed equilibration analysis is made, which shows that the pressure equilibration behaves completely different during filling and emptying. To exam- ine the influence of the temperature changes the heat conductivity of the activated carbon is analysed and the amount of gas stored in function of the thermal conductivity is calculated. 2001-01-1917. Analysis of flow patterns inside an autother- mal gasoline reformer. F. ligner , M. Nau, H. Harndorf, and K. Benninger, Robert Bosch GmbH; R. SchieBl and U. Maas, Univer- sität Stuttgart; and A. Dreizier, Technische Universität Darmstadt. The present paper concentrates on the option of catalytic auto- thermal reforming of gasoline for fuel cell applications. Major parameters of this process are the 4 Steam to Carbon Ratio' S/C and the air to fuel ratio X. Computations assuming thermodynamic equi- librium in the autothermal reactor outlet (ATR) were carried out to attain information about their proper choice, as failure in adjusting the parameters within narrow limits has severe consequences on the reforming process. In order to quantify velocity distribution just ahead the catalyst and to evaluate mixing uniformity we designed an ATR featuring an optical access: Thus flow visualization using PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) and LIF (Laser-Induced Fluores- cence) technique is possible. Preliminary PIV results are presented and compared with CFD computations (Computational Fluid Dynamics). 2001-01-1918. An analysis of hydrogen production from FT liquids for use in fuel-cell systems. David Edlund, William Pledger, and Brad Turnbull, IdaTech, LLC; and Branch Russell, Syntroleum Corp. Synthetic saturated hydrocarbons produced from Fischer- Tropsch (FT) processes offer potential significant advantages as fuels for fuel cell engines. Additionally, FT synthetic fuels, unlike petroleum-derived liquid fuels, are produced absent of sulfur or met- als. Elimination of fuel clean-up processes to remove these threats to fuel cell systems offers the potential of significant capital and operational savings. Additionally, the flexibility of synthetic fuel production offers the potential for optimization of synthetic fuel-cell fuels for use in fuel processors. To better assess the hydrogen-carrying capacity and reforma- bility of saturated FT fuels in a fuel cell system under development for commercial applications, IdaTech tested four synthetic fuels pro- vided by Syntroleum, including synthetic naphtha (FC-2), synthetic diesel (S-2), synthetic light oil (S-l) and synthetic blend (S-5). Methanol was used as the comparison case because this alternative fuel is being seriously considered for use in fuel cell vehicles. All tests were conducted using a fully integrated IdaTech™ fuel proces- sor (incorporating hydrogen purification) and rated to deliver up to 40 sLm product hydrogen. Test results show consistent high yields of hydrogen from all FT liquid fuels. 2001-01-1919. LNG vehicle fuel pressure strategy alterna- tives. Jerry Wiens, California Energy Commission; Charles Powars, Research Partnership ; and Gary Pope, USA PRO and Associates. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) use as a heavy-duty vehicle fuel is increasing. Current generation high-horsepower natural gas engines used in trucks and buses typically require fuel supply pressures in the range 75 to 120 psig. LNG delivered to the fueling station usu- ally has a saturation pressure of roughly 10 psig. A variety of approaches may be used to provide the required fuel pressure increase. Each approach involves a different on-vehicle fuel system design, and LNG station capabilities must accommodate vehicle fuel system requirements. This paper describes various LNG vehicle fuel system design strategies including key tradeoffs, implications on station requirements, and developmental status. The most commonly used fuel system design receives and stores the LNG in the vehicle tank at a saturation pressure at least equal to the engine fuel supply pressure requirement. This design is rela- tively simple, but it requires fuel conditioning (saturation pressure and temperature increase) at the station. This increases station cost and decreases fuel density and hence vehicle range. Saturated LNG fuel systems typically include a pressure-reducing function which can increase the tank hold time for most applications. LNG vehicle fuel systems based on non-saturated LNG theory are also being developed and tested. These seek to maintain the liq- uid in the fuel tank in a subcooled state (at lower temperatures and higher densities than saturated systems). This approach employs a pressure-building circuit. A key issue for pressure-building circuits, which are also used in certain saturated fuel system concepts, is the time needed to build initial pressure following refueling. Pumped systems have been used for direct-injection natural gas engines with very high fuel pressure requirements that cannot be met with practi- cal pressure-transfer systems. Cryogenic pumps may also be used for lower pressure requirements, but there are concerns regarding their relative cost and durability for this application. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1920. A comparison of ion-current-based algorithms for peak pressure position control. Magnus Hellring and UlfHol- mberg, Intelligent Systems Laboratory, IDE. Combustion timing control of SI engines can be improved by feedback of the peak pressure position (PPP). However, pressure sensors are costly, and therefore, nonintrusive and cheap ion-current 'soft sensors' have been suggested. Three different algorithms have been proposed that extract information about PPP from the ion cur- rent signal. In this paper, these approaches are compared with respect to accuracy, operational range, implementation aspects, as well as sensitivity to engine load and inlet air humidity. 2001-01-1921. Fiber optic sensor for crank angle-resolved measurements of burned gas residual fraction in the cylinder of an SI engine. Matthew J. Hall and Patrick Zuzek, University of Texas ; and Richard W. Anderson, Ford Motor Co. A fiber optic infrared spectroscopic sensor was developed to measure the crank angle-resolved residual fraction of burned gas retained in the cylinder of a four-stroke SI engine. The sensor detected the attenuation of infrared radiation in the 4.3 pm infrared vibrational-rotational absorption band of CO2. The residual fraction remaining in the cylinder is proportional to the CO2 concentration. The sensor was tested in a single-cylinder CFR spark ignition engine fired on propane at a speed of 700 rpm. 244</page><page sequence="244">2001-01-1921-2001-01-1927 The sensor was located in one of two spark plug holes of the CFR engine. A pressure-transducer-type spark plug was used to record the cylinder pressure and initiate the spark. The temporal resolution of the measurements was 540 ļis (equivalent to 2.3 crank angle degrees) and the spatial resolution was 6 mm. Measurements were made during the intake and compression stroke for several intake manifold pressures. The compression ratio of the engine was varied from 6.3 to 9.5. As expected, the residual mass fraction was found to fall rapidly during the start of the intake stroke. Fluctuations in the local burned gas concentration were a maximum near BDC of the intake stroke at which time the local burned gas concentration also reached a minimum. Cycle-to-cycle variations in the residual gas fraction were evident. The residual gas fraction increased as load was reduced and as the compression ratio was reduced. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1922. Transient temperature measurement of gas using fiber optic heterodyne interferometry. Nobuyuki Kawa- hara, Eiji Tornita , and Hiroshi Kamakura, Okayama Univ. A fiber optical heterodyne interferometry system was developed to obtain high temporal resolution temperature histories of unburned and burned gases non-intrusi vely. The effective optical path length of the test beam changes with the gas density and corresponding changes of the refractive index. Therefore, the temperature history of the gas can be determined from the pressure and phase shift of the interference signal. The resolution of the temperature measure- ment is approximately 0.5 K, and is dependent upon both the sam- pling clock speed of the A/D converter and the length of the test sec- tion. A polarization-preserving fiber is used to deliver the test beam to and from the test section, to improve the feasibility of the system as a sensor probe. This optical heterodyne interferometry system may also be used for other applications that require gas density and pressure measurements with a fast response time, or a transient tem- perature record. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1924. In-cylinder combustion visualization in an auto-igniting gasoline engine using fuel tracer- and formalde- hyde-LIF imaging. Nicole Graf Joachim Gronki, and Christof Schulz, Universität Heidelberg; and Thierry Bar it aud, Jerome Cherel, Pierre Duret, and Jacques Lavy, Rueil Malmaison. In an optical accessible 4-stroke engine laser-induced fluores- cence (LIF) imaging measurements of fuel tracer (3-pentanone) and formaldehyde were performed during the compression stroke and combustion. Formaldehyde (HCHO) is intermediately present at high concentrations within the cool flame and is burned later on when the 'hot' combustion proceeds. It can be used as an internally generated tracer to observe the boundaries of the hot combustion zones. Despite the fact that a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser excites only weak transitions in the HCHO molecule, the high con- centration (several thousands ppm) provide for sufficient signal intensity when detecting fluorescence above 395 nm. Using formal- dehyde LIF, auto-ignition (occurring close to 356°ca) and the fur- ther development of combustion was observed. Combustion was completed within the field of view by 360°ca in most observed engine cycles. 3-pentanone which has been used frequently for fuel- concentration imaging in spark-ignited engines was of limited use in the CAI engine due to laser and signal attenuation prior to top dead center as a result of tracer destruction during and UV absorp- tion by cool-flame intermediates. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1925. Double-pulse PLIF imaging of self-ignition centers in an SI engine. Robert Schießl , Andreas Dreizler, and Ulrich Maas , Universität Stuttgart; and Andrew J. Grant, and Paul Ewart, University of Oxford. In this study, the occurrence of auto-ignition centers in a two- stroke SI engine was investigated using planar laser-induced fluo- rescence (PLIF). An experimental SI engine equipped with glass windows to enable full optical access into the combustion chamber was operated under knocking conditions. The pulsed output of two XeCl excimer lasers was formed into planar light sheets (300 pm ? 4 cm), which were spatially overlapped and directed into the com- bustion chamber of the operating engine. Unburned fuel compo- nents fluoresce strongly when illuminated with XeCl laser radiation; burned regions display no fluorescence. Self-ignited regions there- fore show up as dark sites in the fluorescence images, indicating local consumption of the fuel. The resulting PLIF images were recorded using fast-gated ICCD cameras. By delaying the second laser pulse a specific time (100 ns-600 ps), image pairs were acquired which allowed the temporal development and mutual influ- ence of hot-spots to be studied. The short laser pulse duration (20 ns), the two-dimensional nature of the imaged region and the strong signals obtained from our detection scheme yield very detailed information of the self-ignited regions. Approximately 20,000 image pairs were recorded. As important quantities, spatial distribu- tion and expansion velocities were extracted from the PLIF images and investigated statistically. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1926. Laser-induced fluorescence detection of NO in the combustion chamber of an optical GDI engine with A-X(0,1) excitation. P. Jamette, Institut Français du Pétrole; P. Desgroux, UMR CNRS ; and V. Ricordeau and B. Deschamps, Institut Français du Pétrole. Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence has been set up to study in- cylinder production of NO in a realistic optical GDI engine. The excitation in the A-X (0,1) band of NO around 236 nm has been used for the first time. This was possible by means of an optical parametric oscillator laser system. A very careful choice of the exci- tation wavelength has been made with the assistance of a spectral simulation code of NO and O2 molecules. The first tests inside the engine running in the early injection mode were performed. Global equivalence ratio was set to 0.9 and NO concentration in the exhaust was about 3200 ppm. Pressure traces were recorded and a combus- tion analysis was performed. Direct flame and fluorescence images were acquired at numerous crank angle degrees between 320 CAD and 500 CAD (TDC=360CAD). Individual images depicted non- homogeneous NO distribution between 450 CAD and 500 CAD. Interference with oxygen seemed negligible whereas a strong absorption phenomenon was observed. Quantification possibilities were also discussed. 2001-01-1927. (SP- 1628) Using cloud point depressants opportunistically to reduce No. 2 diesel fuel cloud point give- away. John S. Manka, Eric A. Lindenfelser, and Fred E. Heller, Lubrizol Corp. Diesel fuel is a blend of various middle distillate components separated at the refinery. The composition and characteristics of the diesel fuel blend changes daily if not hourly because of normal pro- cess variation, changing refinery processing conditions, changing crude oil diet or changing diesel fuel and kerosene market condi- tions. Regardless of the situation going on at the refinery or the mar- ket, the resultant diesel fuel must consistently meet established cloud point specifications. To consistently meet the cloud point specifications, refiners are forced to blend their diesel fuels in such a way that the resultant blend is always on the low side of the cloud point specification even when the refining process adversely changes the fuel characteristics. This practice has the effect of producing several degrees of cloud point 'giveaway' when the refinery is not experiencing adverse swings in product quality. This designed 'giveaway' costs the refin- ery money by not letting the refinery optimize the value of their blend components. By blending diesel fuel components closer to the cloud point specification or by raising distillation cut points, and only using cloud point depressants opportunistically to remediate over specifi- cation fuel blends, refiners can minimize cloud point giveaway, 245</page><page sequence="245">2001-01-1927-2001-01-1933 optimize their profit and market a more consistent diesel fuel prod- uct. This paper discusses a statistical analysis of 'cloud point give- away,' die economics of cloud point giveaway, and shows how refiners can reduce cloud point giveaway to maximize refinery profit and help produce a more consistent diesel fuel product. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1928. (SP- 1628) Diesel fuel lubricity - Base fuel effects. Ken Mitchell , Shell Canada Limited . Many modern diesel fuel injection equipment designs rely totally on the fuel to provide lubrication. The ability of a diesel fuel to lubricate diesel fuel injection equipment has become commonly referred to as its 'lubricity.' If a diesel fuel has insufficient lubricity then the performance of the fuel injection equipment can be compro- mised resulting in reduced durability and increased vehicle emis- sions. We have been studying diesel fuel lubricity since the early 1990s using a test rig. The test rig consists of a motored-distributor-type fuel injection pump, injectors and a fuel handling/circulation sys- tem. This paper reviews test rig results on a total of twenty three dif- ferent base fuels. The pump test rig results are compared to the inspection properties of the test fuels and conclusions derived. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1929. (SP-1628) The influence of fatty acids and fatty acids mixtures on the lubricity of low-sulfur diesel fuels. Czesław Kajdas and Marzena Majzner, Warsaw University of Technology. Research described in this work relates to tribological properties of fatty acids and fatty acids mixtures and aims at providing more information on and better understanding of the wear process in the presence of low-sulfur fractions containing these substances at very low concentration under boundary lubrication conditions in the steel-on-steel system. Experiments were carried out using a ball-on-disc friction machine. To get detailed information on interaction of diesel fuel components with individual fatty acids and mixtures of acids, low- sulfur diesel fuel cuts as well as their mixtures and two model hydro- carbons were used as the base fluids. Although the overall picture of the obtained results is very com- plex, it can be concluded that: (a) Tribological properties of base diesel fuels are determined by the highest boiling fractions and het- erogeneous compounds present in these fractions; (b) Fatty acids and their equimolar mixtures - added to the 'reformulated diesel fuels' at the adequate concentration - show excellent anti wear prop- erties; (c) Both the chemical structure and viscosity of base fluids influence the wear behavior of fatty acids and their mixtures. All the findings are challenging from the viewpoint of their inter- pretation as well as from their relation to the diesel fuel constitution. Obtained results also evidently confirm the complexity of the boundary lubrication approach. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1930. (SP-1628) Combustion of used lubricating oil in a diesel engine. H. Taj ima, K. Takasaki , and M. Nakashima, Kyu- shu Univ.; J. Yanagi, T. Takaishi, H. Ishida , and S. Osafune , Mitsu- bishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.; and K. Iwamoto, Petroleum Energy Center (PEC) Japan. In Japan, about 750 million liters of lubricating oil from automo- biles and marine engines become waste per year. The authors pro- pose a plan to convert such used lubricating oil (ULO) to effective energy. In detail, some special diesel generator plants should be built and ULO should be burned there after some process. This plan has at least two advantages, i.e., to save the petroleum energy and to avoid the environmental pollution. Aim of this study is to develop the way to utilize ULO for diesel fuel at such a generator plant. Combustion characteristics of ULO are in detail investigated by observation of burning flames in a visual engine and by engine test run. As results of comparison between ULO and heavy fuel oil (HFO), ULO shows rather better ignition quality in the visual engine and lower smoke emission from the running test engine than HFO. However, as abnormally thick deposit of combustion products is found in the combustion chamber after a short time running, it is confirmed that some process to remove the additives from ULO before supplying to the engine is essential for the practical use. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1931. (SP- 1626) On-road demonstration of NOx emission control for heavy-duty diesel trucks using SINOx™ urea SCR technology - Long-term experience and measurement results. Bernd Amon, Siemens AG; and Gary Keefe, Siemens Wes- tinghouse Power Corp. The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is one of the most effi- cient technologies to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions arising from technical combustion processes. For compliance with future emission limits for heavy-duty diesel engines the SCR technology might play an important role. In two long-term field demonstrations heavy-duty (HD) trucks were equipped with SCR emission control systems (SINOx™-System) and were operated under daily working conditions. A number of measurements of both the performance and the activity of the catalyst during the entire operation time were per- formed. On the engine test bench the NOx reduction at the begin- ning of the road test was compared to the NOx-reduction at the end of the program. The initial NOx remained unchanged within the measurement accuracy of the analyzing equipment. On-road mea- surements of the emissions were done using an analyzer test cell installed on the loading area of the truck. During the course of the demonstration program the catalyst activity was measured at defined test conditions in a bench scale reactor. Therefore catalyst samples were taken from the operating systems at certain mileages to monitor the activity of the catalyst as a function of operating time. Information about the deterioration of the catalysts allows for sizing the system accordingly to meet the emission requirements over the useful life. The results obtained demonstrate the capability of the SINOx™-System for NOx reduction and the long-term durability of the catalyst. With the experience from the demonstration program the SINOx™-Filter was improved. By means of a catalyst with opti- mized properties the performance in NOx reduction could be improved further. On-road demonstration programs with the improved system are on the way in the US and more are planned. 2001-01-1932. (SP- 1626) Strategies for meeting future har- monized emissions standards in sport utility vehicles with direct-injection diesel engines. Phil R. Hore, Mark E. Dunn, Domi- nic J. Burton, and Robert G. Bending, Ricardo Consulting Engi- neers Ltd. Future emissions standards (TIER II, LEV2) require that diesel- fuelled vehicles meet the same emissions levels as their gasoline counterparts. In addition, Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) must com- ply to the same norms as passenger cars. However the diesel engine has many desirable attributes for SUV applications and an important role to play in addressing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions issues. In-cylinder reduction of pollutants can no longer be relied upon as the major means to meet future standards. Solutions based solely on emissions control technology are also unlikely to yield positive results. The only viable solution is the combined use of in-cylinder emissions control with advanced catalyst technologies. However, a highly integrated approach is required to gain maximum benefit from the technologies used and enable very low targets to be achieved. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1933. (SP- 1626) Performance of a NOx adsorber and catalyzed particle filter system on a light-duty diesel vehicle. C. Scott Sluder and Brian H. West, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 246</page><page sequence="246">2001-01-1933-2001-01-1941 A prototype emissions control system consisting of a close- coupled lightoff catalyst, catalyzed diesel particle filter (CDPF), and a NOx adsorber was evaluated on a Mercedes A 170 CDI. This labo- ratory experiment aimed to determine whether the benefits of these technologies could be utilized simultaneously to allow a light-duty diesel vehicle to achieve levels called out by U.S. Tier 2 emissions legislation. This research was carried out by driving the A 170 through the U.S. Federal Test Procedure (FTP), US06, and highway fuel economy test (HFET) dynamometer driving schedules. The vehicle was fiieled with a 3 -ppm ultra-low sulfur fuel. Regeneration of the NOx adsorber/CDPF system was accomplished by using a lab- oratory in-pipe synthesis gas injection system to simulate the capa- bilities of advanced engine controls to produce suitable exhaust con- ditions. The results show that these technologies can be combined to provide high pollutant reduction efficiencies in excess of 90% for NOx and PM. 2001-01-1934. (SP- 1626) Influence of both catalyst geometry and fuel sulfur content on NOx adsorber poisoning. Matthias Bouchez and Jean-Baptiste Dementhon , IFP; Isabelle Messaoudi, Ségime; Marc Guyon, Renault; and Rémi Noirot, PSA. NOx adsorbers are very sensitive to sulfur poisoning and future fuel standards are unlikely to be sufficient to prevent the system from requiring periodic desulfation procedures. The purpose of this paper is to present the effects of low fuel sulfur content such as 50 ppm and 10?ppm on the NOx adsorber efficiency for a diesel appli- cation. Through this study, the influence of the substrate cell geome- try has also been assessed. The use of a 10 ppm sulfur fuel is not enough to maintain, at a high level, the NOx adsorber performance during a 40,000 km aging test. The desulfation criterion (efficiency loss of 30%) is reached after the first 16,000?km. However, the desulfation operation is not enough to recover the initial catalyst performance and the poisoning velocity increases as the catalyst ages. The hexagonal cell substrate catalyst is less sensitive to sulfur poisoning than a square cell substrate catalyst so that its desulfation frequency is much lower. With a 10 ppm sulfur fuel, 4 desulfation operations were achieved with a hexagonal cell catalyst as opposed to 1 1 with a square cell catalyst during the 40,000 km aging test. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1935. (SP- 1626) Mechanism of NOx reduction by ethanol on a silver-base catalyst. Tadashi Noto and Tadashi Murayama, Hokkaido Automotive Engineering College ; and Shigeru Tosaka and Yasuhiro Fujiwara , Hokkaido Institute of Tech- nology. Since there is a trade-off relationship between NOx and particu- lates in exhaust gas emitted from a diesel engine, simultaneous reduction of the amounts of NOx and particulates in a combustion chamber is difficult. However, the amount of particulates produced in the combustion process could be reduced in a state of almost com- plete combustion, and the amount of NOx produced during the com- bustion process could be reduced by the use of a catalyst and reduc- ing agent in the exhaust process. It has been demonstrated that the use of ethanol as a reducing agent on a silver-base catalyst in the presence of oxygen is an effective means for reducing NOx, although the mechanism of the reduction has not been elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, an NOx-reduction apparatus was conducted, and model experiments on NOx reduction were carried out in an atmosphere simulating exhaust gas emitted from a diesel engine and at the same catalyst temperature as that in a combustion chamber. The correlations of NOx reduction rate with the amounts of the components produced by ethanol decomposition and the amounts of the components produced by ethanol oxidation were determined with the aim of elucidating the mechanism of NOx reduction. It was found that NOx is reduced when ethanol is oxi- dized into acetaldehyde and, furthermore, when oxidized or partially oxidized products are formed by acetaldehyde oxidation. It was also found that the NOx reduction rate when ethanol preheating was used was highest (75-95%) at the catalyst temperature of 500 regardless of the ethanol preheating temperature. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1937. (SP- 1628) Effects of ethanol additives on diesel particulate and NOx emissions. Roger L. Cole , Ramesh B. Poola , and Raj Sekar, Ar gonne National Laboratory; and Jerome E. Schaus, and Patrick McPartlin , AutoResearch Laboratories , Inc. Particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions from a 1.9-liter Volk- swagen diesel engine were measured for three different fuels: neat diesel fuel, a blend of diesel fuel with 10% ethanol, and a blend of diesel fuel with 15% ethanol. Engine-out emissions were measured on an engine dynamometer for five different speeds and five differ- ent torques using the standard engine-control unit. Results show that particulate emissions can be significantly reduced over approxi- mately two-thirds of the engine map by using a diesel-ethanol blend. Nitrogen oxide emissions can also be significantly reduced over a smaller portion of the engine map by using a diesel-ethanol blend. Moreover, there is an overlap between the regions where particulate emissions can be reduced by up to 75% and nitrogen oxide emis- sions are reduced by up to 84% compared with neat diesel fuel. 2001-01-1939. (SP- 1628) Effect of nozzle diameter and EGR ratio on the flame temperature and soot formation for various fuels. Danilo Nikolic, University of Montenegro ; and Kazunari Wakimoto, Shinya Takahashi, and Norimasa lida, Keio Univ. In this study, effects of nozzle hole diameter and EGR ratio on flame temperature (indication of NO formation) and KL value (indi- cation of soot formation) were investigated. Combustion of a single diesel fuel spray in the cylinder of a rapid compression machine (RCM) was analyzed. Three nozzles with different hole diameter were used corresponding to present, near-term and long-term heavy- duty diesel engine specifications. EGR was simulated through 2%vol. CO2 addition to the inlet air and by increase of in-cylinder surrounding gas temperature. Various types of fuels were used in this. The ignition and combustion processes of diesel fuel spray were observed by a high-speed direct photography and by indicated pressure diagrams. Flame temperature and KL factor were analyzed by a two-color method. With larger nozzle hole diameters there are larger high temperature areas. With smaller nozzle hole diameters there is more soot formed. Introduction of 2% vol. CO2 to the inlet air does not influence NO, neither soot formations. With higher in- cylinder surrounding gas temperatures there are higher flame tem- peratures throughout combustion process. 2001-01-1940.

In this study, the effects of fuel properties, aromatics content and 90% distillation temperature T90, on flame temperature and soot formation were studied using a rapid compression machine (RCM). Aromatics content and T90 distillation temperature were parameters isolated from influence of each other, and from cetane number. A fuel spray was injected in the RCM combustion chamber by a single nozzle hole. The ignition and combustion processes of diesel spray were observed by a high-speed direct photography. Flame tempera- ture and KL factor (which indicates the soot concentration), were analyzed by the two-color method. The rate of heat release was ana- lyzed from indicated diagrams. The fuels with aromatics content showed higher flame temperature. The fuel with highest T90 distil- lation temperature showed highest flame temperature. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1941. (SP-1628) The use of emulsion, water induc- tion and EGR for controlling diesel engine emissions. M. A. A. Nazha, H. Rajakaruna, and S. A. Wagstaff, De Monifort Univ. 247</page><page sequence="247">2001-01-1941-2001-01-1946 A comparative experimental investigation into the use of water- in-diesel fuel emulsion, inlet manifold water induction and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) as means of controlling diesel engine emissions has been carried out. The tests were performed on a 2.5 1, four-cylinder, direct injection Ford diesel engine. The engine was modified to incorporate a water injection system into the air intake and an EGR system. Water-in-fuel emulsion was prepared by mix- ing and circulating the mixture for an appropriate length of time prior to injection into the engine. A computerized data acquisition system capable of logging the engine performance parameters (cyl- inder pressure, engine speed, engine load ..., etc.) was also devel- oped and used to obtain the required data. The amount of water in the emulsion was varied, as was the amount of water introduced into the intake manifold and the amount of EGR. The exhaust emissions from the engine were analyzed for smoke, NOx, uHC, CO, CO2 and oxygen. The findings of this study are presented in this paper. The results from all the tests are discussed and compared. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are highlighted and the most suitable method for a particular set of engine operating conditions is identi- fied. It is shown that while EGR can effect a substantial reduction in NOx emissions; this is achieved at the expense of increased smoke. Water induction on the other hand can result with up to 60% reduction in NOx at no real cost in terms of engine performance or other pollutants. The use of emulsified fuel is seen to effect reduc- tions in both NOx and smoke at no cost to the engine performance (as indicated by specific fuel consumption and thermal efficiency). It is concluded that the use of emulsified fuels or a combination of EGR and water addition could prove beneficial in terms of control- ling diesel engine emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1943. (SP- 1626) Original modeling approach of die- sel particulate filter regeneration. Louiza Achour and Jean- Baptiste Dementhon , Institut Français du Pétrole ; and Pierre Rouchon, École des mines de Paris. Since the particulate emissions of diesel engine are suspected to be harmful on health, the standards limiting this source of pollutant are increasingly stringent: 0.05 g/km for 2000 and 0.025 g/ km for 2005 (for light-duty vehicles). Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF) are known for their large filtration efficiency in terms of nano-particles and therefore, constitute the most effective solution to reduce these emissions. The development of such a technology implies the com- bination of a trap and regeneration process. This requires the imple- mentation of advanced engine management strategies aimed at peri- odically rising exhaust gas temperature to reach the particle light- off. In order to set such strategies, it appears necessary to build a numerical regeneration model. This paper reports an original modeling approach. It presents a relatively simple model to capture the main features of a DPF' s regeneration behavior, namely temperature, oxygen content, and soot depletion. It uses a model based on 'coupled' interactions between the exotherm (and combustion mechanism) and the DPF response. The numerical results are compared to the engine bench test results in order to validate the capacities of the model. This model will be further used to develop and compare various strate- gies for the thermal gradients control. 2001-01-1944. (SP- 1626) Improving flow uniformity in a die- sel particulate filter system. Lizheng Ma and Marius Paraschivolu, University of Toronto ; and Justin Yao and Larry Blackman , Engine Control Systems. In this study, a simulation-based flow optimization of the diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems is performed. The geometry and the swirl component of the inlet flow is optimized to improve flow uni- formity upstream of the filter and to decrease overall pressure drop. The flow through the system is simulated with Fluent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software from Fluent Inc. The wall-flow filter is modeled with an equivalent porous material. This study only investigates the clean flow. The DPF system is composed of three parts: the inlet diffuser, the filter and the outlet nozzle. In the original system a linear cone joins the inlet and outlet pipes to the cylindrical filter. Due to the large opening angle of this cone, flow separates and creates a recir- culation zone between the inlet and the filter. The flow pattern reveals that a large area of the filter is not used: More than 88% of the air flow passes through less than 53% of the area. The filter, as well as the inlet and the outlet pipes, have standard diameters, there- fore only the geometry of the cone can be optimized to increase the use of the filter. A unipolar sigmoid function (USF) is used to gener- ate a streamlined diffuser and nozzle therefore avoiding any separa- tion zone. This function is controlled by one parameter which is optimized. The optimum USF shape considerably improves the flow uniformity in front of the filter. To further improve the flow uniformity in the actual system, a swirl velocity is added. Two cases are investigated; a swirl flow with different angular velocities and a swirl flow with constant velocity applied only on a small annular area on the outer diameter of the inlet pipe. All results indicate that the addition of a swirl component to the flow improves flow uniformity, nevertheless, a constant swirl on the outside of 20 m/s is ideal. This effect, combined with the opti- mum USF shape, greatly increases flow uniformity and reduces the overall pressure drop. 2001-01-1945. (SP- 1626) Evaluation of various strategies for continuous regeneration of particulate filters. Hagit Persiko and Eran Sher, Ben-Gurion Univ. Exhaust gases of diesel engines may be cleaned of particulates fairly effectively by filtering the gases through various types of beds. Filter regeneration is however, necessary to maintain a clean filter and to keep its flow resistance low. Uninterrupted regeneration may be achieved by burning up the trapped particulates in a continu- ous manner. Under high engine load conditions, this is attainable by reducing the ignition temperature of the particulates by means of suitable fuel additives, or by means of an appropriate catalytic coat- ing of the relevant filter components. However, under low engine loads, the exhaust gas temperature might be too low and another sensible method has to be employed to continuously ignite the par- ticulates. Apparently, the minimum required exhaust temperature may be achieved over a fairly wide range of engine operation conditions by using several simple-to-employ means. These include inlet throt- tling (IAT), inlet pre-heating (IAP), exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), exhaust throttling (EGT), and the like. We ask to what extent these straightforward means can affect the exhaust gas temperature at the relevant range of engine speeds and loads. Prior to performing extensive and expensive experimental research -or investing in a reliable numerical model to simulate the engine operation under these different operation conditions, it seems appropriate to perform a crude evaluation. We wish to evaluate the effects of these means, and to provide a rough indication of how to plan the experiment more effectively. For this purpose a simplified model - can no doubt be beneficial. In this paper we will explore how feasible it is to keep the exhaust gas temperature above a given pre-determined temperature - by using these simple-to-employ means. 2001-01-1946.

To convert the measurement of number to mass, the instrument assumes that all the particles are spheres and are of a constant density, defined by the user, but normally around 1000kg/m3.

This paper presents a review of the current situation of the knowl- edge on converting particle number into mass, using the ELPI or other particle size instruments. Andersen Impactors were used for gravimetric determinations of the mass in the sizes above 400 nm, in order to compare their results with ELPI number measurements. Gravimetric determination of mass using the ELPI was also attempted. The sampling time with both instruments was two hours to collect enough mass to weigh in each size range. The compared distributions agreed well in the middle size range measured by the ELPI, but resulted in an overestimated mass for particles bigger than 1 [im. 2001-01-1947. (SP- 1626) DAF Euro-4 heavy-duty diesel engine with TNO EGR system and CRT particulates filter. Ruud Verbeek, Marc van Aken, and Maarten Verkiel, TNO Automotive. This paper reports on a study of the TNO venturi EGR system and the Johnson Matthey CRT particulates trap on a DAF 355 kW engine. The results obtained indicate that this EGR-CRT combina- tion is an effective means to achieve EURO-4 emission level, while maintaining good fuel economy. EGR strategy, injection timing and air-fuel ratio were optimized in such a way that good regeneration conditions were obtained across most of the engine operating map. Also transient EGR con- trol is optimised to combine low NOx emission during the ETC with good driveability and good engine out particulates emission. The size of the oxidation catalyst in the CRT was investigated. It appeared that the larger oxidation catalyst showed a better regen- eration performance during a low temperature duty-cycle. Negative aspects of a larger oxidation catalyst are increased costs and increased NO2 emission (because of the catalyst ability to oxidize more NO into NO2). In order to secure regeneration under all circumstances it was found necessary to develop an active regeneration control strategy. This strategy will temporarily increase exhaust temperature and NOx-PM ratio when a high back pressure is detected. The EGR-CRT system is installed in a truck to investigate its performance and durability in practise. 2001-01-1948. (SP- 1626) Diesel aftertreatment systems: 2004- 2007, a cost assessment. James P. Warren, Open Univ. This study assesses the exhaust aftertreatment technologies, and the costs thereof, required to achieve future emissions legislation. Firstly, a brief summary of the types of systems is addressed with a cost of implementation implicitly attached to each system of choice. The three major routes considered to meet the various legis- lated limits are: a diesel particulate filter coupled with EGR (exhaust gas recirculation), a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system based on urea, and a combination of both a filter and SCR. The sys- tems are reviewed with an emphasis on emissions reduction poten- tial as well as possible diesel fuel savings where applicable. Sec- ondly, the cost implications of using a secondary, water-based fuel (urea) on board diesel vehicles as a basis for NOx reduction via a simple discounted cash flow methodology are explored. By utilizing the methodology described, various parameters such as fuel costs (both diesel and urea), annual mileage, fuel economy, and system cost can be varied and examined in detail. The 'system' costs are calculated throughout the vehicle life, within a practical framework, in order to assess the feasibility of implementing these advanced aftertreatment systems in the future. Other issues that are briefly considered include quantities of urea predicted to meet the needs of the systems, urea fuel storage and delivery aspects, and potential increase in urea production. 2001-01-1949. (SP- 1626) Measuring diesel emissions with a split exhaust configuration. W. Scott Wayne, Eric R. Corrigan, Richard J. Atkinson, Nigel N. Clark, and Donald W. Lyons, West Virginia Univ. West Virginia University evaluated diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) and lean-NOx catalysts as part of Diesel Emissions Control- Sulfur Effects (DECSE) project. In order to perform thermal aging of the DOC and lean-NOx catalysts simultaneously and economi- cally, each catalyst was sized to accommodate half of the engine exhaust flow. Simultaneous catalyst aging was then achieved by splitting the engine exhaust into two streams such that approxi- mately half of the total exhaust flowed through the DOC and half through the lean-NOx catalyst. This necessitated splitting the engine exhaust into two streams during emissions measurements. Throt- tling valves installed in each branch of the split exhaust were adjusted so that approximately half the engine exhaust passed though the active catalyst under evaluation and into a full flow dilu- tion tunnel for emissions measurement. The remaining exhaust flowed through a passive catalyst of identical dimensions and con- taining a similar ceramic substrate, but with no washcoat of active catalyst material, and was vented from the test facility. Prior to the test cycle, the throttling valves were adjusted at a prescribed steady- state operating point such that the flows in the two branches of the exhaust system were the same while maintaining the specified engine backpressure. The fraction of exhaust entering the measure- ment system was calculated based on a comparison of measured CO2 concentrations taken during a full flow exhaust run and com- pared to the partial flow exhaust run. Emissions sampled from the partial exhaust stream were then corrected based on these measured CO2 concentrations to reflect the original full flow levels. Instanta- neous split ratios were difficult to quantify during transient engine operation, since any variance in time alignment of the CO2 analyzer output trace between the full flow and successive split flow runs would cause substantial errors in the calculation of the split ratio. However, integrated engine-out emissions measured in the split exhaust streams during transient operation generally agreed well with emissions measured using the full exhaust stream. Measured emissions in the partial exhaust configuration remained within 5% of a 50/50 split except at idle or low power operation. When these results from a split-flow test were corrected for full flow, measured emissions were within 11% of the full exhaust case for transient tests and 13% for steady state tests. An average difference between full flow and 50/50 corrected test runs was 4% for transient runs and 7% for steady state runs. 2001-01-1951. (SP-1626) The transient deposition and parti- cle changes across a combined oxidation and hydrocarbon stor- age catalyst under diesel cold-start conditions. G. E. Andrews, A. J. Clarke, and N. Y. Rojas, University of Leeds; and D. Gregory, and T. Sale, Ford Motor Company Ltd. This work is part of a larger program to investigate the storage at low -power conditions and release at high-power conditions in real diesel engine exhaust systems. The initial particle storage in the oxi- dation catalyst, followed by a release of particles a few minutes later, is explored, and the associated particle size distribution changes determined. A Ford 1.8L IDI Diesel Engine, Turbocharged and Intercooled (TCIC), and equipped with Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), was used under high-speed and high-power conditions, both during cold start. The commercial close-coupled diesel oxidation catalyst had an associated hydrocarbon adsorber for cold-start hydrocarbon control. The tests were carried out using a step cold start to a fixed low- power output, typical of city driving. The ELPI particle size ana- lyzer was used together with constant temperature gravimetric filter- based mass samples upstream and downstream of the catalyst. The results showed that there was a net deposition of particles on the catalyst during the first minutes of the cold start followed by a release at a later time that was related to the catalyst light-off time. The size distribution was shown to change between the inlet and outlet of the catalyst during this cold-start period. These tests were carried out with preconditioning the previous day at idle and at high power. This gave two initial catalyst conditions - saturated with hydrocarbons and covered in soot (idle preconditioning) and rela- 249</page><page sequence="249">2001-01-1951-2001-01-1958 tively empty adsorber and soot free catalyst. The results showed that both preconditioning modes of the catalyst gave deposition on the catalyst. The size distribution changes across the catalyst were dif- ferent for the two preconditioning techniques. The cold-start part of diesel test cycles is becoming more impor- tant and, since oxidation catalysts are a major part of the emissions control in diesel passenger cars, their performance is of significance. This work shows that in terms of particulate emissions there is a complex performance under cold start conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1953. (SP- 1629) A study of ignition discharge parameters effects on homogeneous mixtures combustion in engine. Radu Chiriac, Robert Radu , and Nicolae Apostolescu, Uni- versity "Politehnica" of Bucharest. The enhancement of the ignition discharge parameters has been proved as an efficient means to control homogeneous lean combus- tion, but its effects on the burning stages is still controversial. This work presents the results of a study about the effect of a moderate enhancement of the ignition systems on lean homoge- neous mixtures combustion in a conventional engine. Three ignition systems were compared: a standard inductive system, (Ml) a long duration glow discharge ignition system (M2) and a capacitor dis- charge system (M3). Effects on combustion, over a wide range of operating conditions were examined, based on the engine outputs and heat release analysis. Durations of the flame development stage and rapid burning stage were correlated to give a measure of the strength of the relationship between them. It was found that a positive influence on combustion efficiency and stability is exercised only at engine idle and light loads, M3 being the most efficient. At high load of the engine, the difference between M3 and M2 almost disappeared and in general, the influ- ence of an increased energy and/or power of the electrical discharge on the engine outputs became insignificant. It was confirmed that the main effect of an increased power or energy of the spark appears on the flame development stage; the influence on the rapid burning stage is generally weak, and is associated with lean mixtures and delayed phasing of combustion process within the engine cycle. 2001-01-1954. (SP- 1629) APIR: A new firing concept for the internal combustion engines - Sensitivity to knock and in- cylinder aerodynamics. S. Couet, P. Higelin, and B. Moreau , Université d'Orléans. This paper presents a new firing concept for internal combustion engines called APIR and its performances. This concept attempts to merge the best of both Compression Ignition (CI) and Spark Ignition (SI) engine worlds. The application of this concept to a standard SI engine, leads to a consequent improvement of the firing and combustion performances. Initiation and combustion develop with a speed and a repeatability incompara- ble with the spark plug firing case. The use of the APIR device leads to an increase of the engine operating range in terms of lean operat- ing limit and thus lean burn torque range. This paper points out that the APIR device has a lower knock sensitivity and isn't much affected by the in-cylinder aerodynamics. Thus, it can be shown that to take full advantage of the APIR con- cept in terms of efficiency and pollutants emissions, the SI engine must be redesigned in terms of compression ratio and in-cylinder aerodynamics. 2001-01-1955. (SP- 1629) Determination of the air/fuel ratio of a SI engine during transients with a standard UEGO sensor. Michael A. Winkler and Eckart Mueller , Technical University of Braunschweig. Detailed investigations on wall film behavior in port-injected SI engines show that a standard UEGO sensor leads to inaccurate results during transients concerning the real air/fuel ratio. Purpose of this paper is to identify the reasons for this behavior and develop- ing a compensation strategy. Fuelling transients due to steps in the injection period at constant engine speed and MAP with modified sensors were carried out and the influence of the protective tube and the dynamic behavior of the measuring cell were found to be the essential parameters. The standard UEGO sensor can be used to determine the air/fuel ratio during transients, if the reasons for inac- curate results presented in this paper are considered. 2001-01-1956. (SP- 1629) New data on flame behavior in lean- burn S.I. engine. O. Pajot and C. Mounaïm-Rousselle, Université d'Orléans ; and D. Queiros-Conde, Ecole des Mines de Paris. The concept of lean-burn combustion in spark ignition engines had been developed for reducing both exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. However the operation of engines in this mode is lim- ited due to the misfire phenomenon. Several studies have been con- ducted to improve the understanding of the interaction between flow-field, mixture preparation and the progress of combustion. Multidimensional optical diagnostics are an important tool and in the other hand, the work done on combustion modeling in engine becomes more and more relevant but mainly in the case of stoichio- metric mixture. The objective of the present work is to provide new information on the flame structure in lean mixtures under different flow field configurations, particularly when the flame is in the lami- nar-turbulent transition. Classical Mie scattering tomography of flames was performed in a transparent 4-valve Spark Ignition engine. A comparison between the flame behavior described by Fractal geometry concept and a more recent technique, Covarial analysis, which predicts better the effect of the turbulence level, is presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1957. (SP- 1629) Local flame front structure in the vicinity of the piston in a transparent SI engine. F. Foucher, S. Burnel , and C. Mounaïm-Rousselle , Université d'Orléans. We present an experimental investigation of the local flame front characteristics as function of the distance between the flame front and the piston. The objective of this paper is to provide some experi- mental data about the flame characteristics at the approach of the piston. The transparent engine speed is fixed at 2000 rpm and air- methane mixture was used with an equivalence ratio equal to 0.9. PLIF acetone imaging was acquired to estimate first the curvature, the curvature radius and the normal direction orientation of the local contours as function of the flame-piston distance. A discontinuity in these parameters appears when the distance is less than 1 mm. Secondly we apply local roughness analysis system to estimate the local fractal dimension of the flame front. We conclude that fractal dimension changes rapidly at 2.5 mm from the piston. A logarithm law was found to define the fractal dimension as function of flame- piston distance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1958. (SP- 1629) Performance of an liquid phase LPG injection engine for heavy-duty vehicles. Kernyong Kang , Daeyup Lee , Seungmook Oh, and Changup Kim, Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials. A LPG engine for heavy-duty vehicle has been developed using liquid phase LPG injection (hereafter LPLI) system, which has a strong potential as a next-generation LPG fuel supply system. It has been revealed in this work that an LPLI system generates higher power, efficiency, and emits lower emission pollutants than the con- ventional mixer type system. As a preliminary study on the LPLI system applicable to a heavy duty LPG engine, the engine output and combustion performance were investigated with various operating conditions using a single- cylinder engine equipped with the different fuel supply systems. Experimental results showed that no problems occurred and the vol- umetric efficiency and engine output increased, respectively by about 10%, when the LPLI system is used. A decrease of the intake manifold temperature by the LPLI system has also been observed. These characteristics make it enable to decrease the exhaust gas 250</page><page sequence="250">2001-01-1958-2001-01-1963 temperature and perform better control of knocking phenomena, spark timing and compression ratio. An LPLI engine also has been successfully operate under X = 1.5 or 30% EGR. An optimized swirl ratio for the heavy duty LPG engine was found around Rs = 2.0. Visualized in-cylinder flow near piston surface showed that high swirl ratios above 2.3 did not contribute to breaking swirl flow down into one with small turbulence scale. 2001-01-1959. (SP- 1629) A study on in-cylinder injection of low-pressure natural gas for performance improvement of small-sized two-stroke SI engines. Shiyuji Hatakeyama, Yoshio Sekiya, and Tadashi Murayama, Hokkaido Automotive Engineering College ; Shunsaku Nakai and Takahiro Sako , Osaka Gas Co., Ltd.; and Hideyuki Tsunemoto, Kitami Institute of Technology. Small two-stroke SI engines supplied with natural gas in the intake port are advantageous for low maintenance and low cost when used in co-generation system for residential use. However in the engines with port injection systems, the unburned HC emissions are higher and thermal efficiency is lower than with 4-stroke engines. To overcome these disadvantages, an in-cylinder injection with a special low-pressure injection nozzle system was attempted. The results showed that improvements in unburned HC emissions and thermal efficiency are possible due to the remarkable reduction in scavenging loss and the lean combustion. 2001-01-1960. (SP- 1629) Lean misfire limits of LPG-fueled S.I. engine. Fuad N. Alasfour, Kuwait Univ. The purpose of this research is to investigate the use of local, commercial LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)-fueled spark ignition engine in term of lean misfire limits. A 4-cylinder Suzuki, water- cooled, S.I. engine is tested under different operational conditions (fuel/air equivalence ratio, ignition timing, engine speed and inlet air temperature ). The engine is tested at elevated inlet air tempera- tures to simulate the car engine operational conditions during sum- mer season in Kuwait. Results show that ignition timing is strongly affecting the overall engine lean misfire limit. Experimental results showed that the combustion of LPG-fueled S.I. engine can be improved by advancing ignition timing. Results also show that as the ignition timing advanced the lean misfire limit decrease due to the enhancement in engine combustion efficiency. Experimental results show that as the fuel/air equivalence ratio leaned, the MBT ignition timing need to be advanced, where lean mixtures requires advancing in ignition timing to provide more time for reaction due to the excess presence of oxygen in the fuel/air mix- ture. The engine lean misfire limit increases as the engine speed increase, with the same effect of preheating inlet air temperature, and as the engine load increase, the lean misfire limit increase. 2001-01-1961. (SP- 1628) The performance of a gasoline fric- tion modifier fuel additive. Thomas E. Hayden, Charles A. Ropes, and Michael G. Rawdon, Texaco Additives International. Economic and political factors continue to put pressure on the automotive industry to reduce fuel consumption in vehicles. To increase the fuel efficiency of an engine, engine oil formulations have trended towards lower viscosity and the use of friction modifi- ers. To improve fuel economy further, the fuel itself can be used to deliver friction modifiers to the piston ring-cylinder wall interface, a location where friction is high and the oil quantity is purposely kept low. This paper describes the use of the Sequence VI, VI-A, and VI-B lubricant fuel economy tests to demonstrate the fuel consumption improvement from a gasoline friction modifier fuel additive. To capitalize on the dynamometer results, vehicle tests were conducted using several test cycles, engine oils of different viscosity grades and containing a friction modifier, various gasoline friction modifier fuel additive treat rates, and to predict the effect of long term use. The benefit of the gasoline friction modifier fuel additive was generally found at the higher oil temperature conditions. The fuel economy change was immediately measurable and further gains were seen as the friction modifier fuel additive accumulated in the engine oil and reduced friction in oil-wetted parts of the engine. The use of friction modifiers in engine oil formulations did not negate the fuel additive benefit. This program has shown that using the fuel to supply a friction modifier is a practical method to improve vehicle fuel economy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1962. (SP- 1628) The fuel additive/lubricant interac- tions: Compatibility assessments in field studies and laboratory tests. C. Yvonne Thiel and Thomas E. Hayden, Texaco Additives International. Engine oil performance issues span a broad range of criteria, with the most often addressed including thermal and oxidative degrada- tion control, anti-wear efficacy, contaminant suspension/dispersion capability, acid neutralization, maintenance of low temperature properties, and fuel economy retention. Each of these performance characteristics has an impact on the life expectancy of a lubricant. An additional factor that has been an area of ongoing research in this laboratory is the effect of fuel and fuel additives on the quality and performance of engine oils. It is recognized that fuel can reach the thin film of lubricant on the cylinder wall prior to combustion in an internal combustion engine. In this manner the base fuel constituents and fuel additives can enter the crankcase unburned. Laser-induced fluorescence studies conducted previously demonstrated the delivery mechanism in an optically accessible gasoline powered engine. The extent of fuel and fuel additive build-up in the oil in turn is dependent upon engine type, and operating cycle. Extended drain intervals further magnify any fuel/lubricant compatibility constraints or benefits that may exist. The effect of compliance fuel additives on passenger car engine oils containing Group I, Group III, and Group IV base stocks was examined as a function of drain interval in an extensive fleet test. Base stock influence on the lubricant's reaction to accumulating compliance fuel additives was significant in that the vehicle response ranged from no harm to catastrophic engine failure. The fleet results prompted the development of a proprietary in-house engine test to examine the no-harm nature of fuel additives as part of the fuel additive development program. Laboratory bench tests utilizing thermogravimetric analysis techniques, differential scan- ning calorimetry, and rheological instrumentation were also devised as part of the no-harm battery of tests. The field test data, engine dynamometer evaluations, and the bench methods used to examine fuel additive/lubricant compatibility are reviewed in light of base oil type and additive chemistry. 2001-01-1963. (SP- 1628) Vehicle exhaust emissions benefit from a regulatory cap in gasoline distillation index. Jeremy G. Heiken, Thomas L. Darlington, and Dennis Kahlbaum, Air Improve- ment Resource, Inc.; and Gary Herwick, General Motors Corp. The Distillation Index (DI) is a measure of the volatility of gaso- line, especially its tendency to vaporize in an engine at initial start-up and during warm up. On January 27, 1999 the U.S. domestic and import automotive manufacturers petitioned the US EPA to limit the DI of all U.S. gasoline to 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as a means of reducing in-use emissions and ensuring consistent cold start and warm-up driveability. Air Improvement Resource, Inc., (AIR) completed a 1999 study that evaluated the benefits of a DI cap. Overall, the 1999 AIR study estimated that the DI cap would produce a 16 and 15 percent reduction in hydrocarbon (HC) and car- bon monoxide (CO) exhaust, respectively, from gasoline vehicles nationally in 2020. In 2000, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers sponsored a more comprehensive examination of the emission consequences of the DI cap on which this paper is based. In this paper, the results include an evaluation of 1999 gasoline survey data and an account- ing for potential future changes in oxygenate consumption - for example the elimination of MTBE use in gasoline. This updated 251</page><page sequence="251">2001-01-1963-2001-01-1969 analysis estimates that the DI cap would produce a national benefit of 20 to 23 percent for exhaust HC and 25 percent for exhaust CO. Thus, the need for a DI cap and the benefit from such a cap have increased over that estimated in 1999. Moreover, this paper also shows that the magnitude of the DI cap benefit varies regionally according to gasoline type sold. Areas subject to Federal reformu- lated gasoline requirements potentially would realize the greatest emission inventory benefit from the proposed DI cap - up to a 28 percent reduction in HC exhaust from gasoline vehicles in 2020, and these are areas where the benefit would be the most beneficial to ambient air quality. 2001-01-1964. (SP- 1628) Effects of octane number on strati- fied charge combustion in a direct-injection gasoline engine. Hiroyuki Fukui, Haruo Komoriya, and Toshio Shimizu, Cosmo Research Institute. The effects of octane number on stratified charge combustion were investigated with single-cylinder direct-injection gasoline engine. Two tests were conducted. First, combustion characteristics of stratified charge combustion were studied by changing fuel octane number. Second, auto-ignition characteristics of stratified charge combustion were compared with that of homogeneous charge combustion by changing fuel component. Three types of fuels were used to change octane number and fuel component. They were single-component fuel, multi-component fuel and refinery feedstock, Unique combustion characteristics concerning octane number was found on stratified charge combustion. The increase of indi- cated thermal efficiency and decrease of unburned hydrocarbon were observed as octane number decreased. The difference of octane number influence between stratified charge combustion and homogeneous charge combustion was discussed. 2001-01-1965. (SP- 1628) The optical measurements of water droplet characteristics in turbulent gasoline pipe flow. Choongsik Bae and Jeong Heon Kim , Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; and Dong-Hyon Sheen , SK Corp. Liquid fossil fuel contaminated by water can cause trouble in the combustion processes and affect the endurance of a combustion sys- tem. Using an optical sensor to monitor the water content instanta- neously in a fuel pipeline is an effective means of controlling the fuel quality in a combustion system. In two component liquid flows of oil and water, the flow pattern and characteristics of water drop- lets are changed with various flow conditions. Additionally, the light scattering of the optical sensor measuring the water content is also dependent on the flow patterns and droplet characteristics. There- fore, it is important to investigate the detailed behavior of water droplets in the pipeline of the fuel transportation system. In this study, the flow patterns and characteristics of water drop- lets in the turbulent pipe flow of two component liquids of gasoline and water were investigated using optical measurements. The dis- persion of water droplets in the gasoline flow was visualized, and the size and velocity distributions of water droplets were simulta- neously measured by the phase Doppler technique. The water droplets were spherical and dispersed homogeneously in all conditions of this experiment. The velocity of water droplets was not dependent on the droplet size and the mean velocity of drop- lets was equal to that of the gasoline flow. The mean diameter of water droplets decreased and the number density increased with the Reynolds number of the gasoline flow. 2001-01-1966. The flammability of atmospheres within near- ly-empty liquid fuel tanks. R. Bunama and G. A. Karim, University of Calgary. A comprehensive modeling is made of the transient transport processes taking place within nearly-empty axisymmetrical cylin- drical liquid fuel tanks. The resulting likelihood of the formation or dissipation of flammable mixtures within the tank with time as a consequence of the transient vaporization processes of the fuel are established. Some aspects of the predicted results were validated against our corresponding experimental results involving mainly pure liquid fuels in open cylindrical containers that were nearly- empty. The effects of fuel properties, geometry and ambient condi- tions are considered in relation to the possibility of having the atmo- sphere within the tanks supporting flame propagation, in the event of the presence of an ignition source somewhere within the tank or a flame just outside the tank. The effects of changes in some operat- ing conditions on the potential for fire spread inside liquid fuel tanks are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1967. Understanding soot-mediated oil thickening: Rotational rheology techniques to determine viscosity and soot structure in Peugeot XUD-11 BTE drain oils. Mike Parry , Her- man George , and Julie Edgar , Lubrizol Corp. The Association des Constructeurs Européen d'Automobiles (ACEA) light-duty diesel engine specifications requires a kinematic viscosity measurement technique for Peugeot XUD-11 BTE drain oils. This viscosity measurement is used to define the medium- temperature dispersivity of soot in the drain oil. This paper discusses the use of rotational rheology methods to measure the Newtonian character of XUD-1 1 drain oils. The calcu- lation of the rate index using the Hershel Bulkley model indicates the level of non-Newtonian behavior of the drain oil and directly reflects the level of soot dispersion or agglomeration. This study shows that the more non-Newtonian the drain oil the greater the dif- ference between kinematic and rotational viscosity measurements Oscillation (dynamic) rheological techniques are used to charac- terize build up of soot structure. The storage modulus (G') correlates with flow curve measurements for the 'test pass' drain oils and is inversely related to the rate index value. The more non-Newtonian the drain oil the higher the storage modulus and the lower the rate index. G' is temperature dependent with structure build up occurring at 70-80°C for the more non-Newtonian drain oils. Increased soot level does not correlate to the levels of non-Newtonian behavior and soot structure build up. Structure build up is time dependent at tem- peratures where G' is high and the drain is non-Newtonian. 2001-01-1969. The influence of an on-line oil recycler on oil quality from a bus in service using synthetic oil. Gordon E. Andrews and Jie Xu, University of Leeds; M. H. Jones , Swansea Tri- bology Services Ltd.; and J. Hall , A. Rahman, and P. Mawson, Top High UK Ltd. A method of cleaning lubricating oil on-line was investigated using a one micron bypass particulate filter followed by an infra-red heater, to remove water, dissolved gases and light diesel fractions in the oil. The impact of this oil recycler on oil quality was studied using synthetic oil in an on-road bus test. The bus was of Euro-1 emissions standard and equipped with a Cummins 6-cy linder 8.3 liter turbo-charged inter-cooled DI engine. Comparisons tests were undertaken with and without the oil recycler for about 28,000 miles. Oil samples were analyzed about every 2000 miles. The results showed that the on-line oil recycler achieved significant improve- ments in the oil quality. With the recycler, the TBN depletion rate was reduced by 52%, the TAN increase rate was reduced by 27% and the carbon accumulation rate in the oil was reduced by 42%. The fuel dilution was reduced by the recycler. There was also a sig- nificant reduction in all the wear metals in oil apart from copper, which was influenced by copper components in the recycler. Metal reductions varied from 38% for iron to 100% for aluminum. Accord- ingly, the oil recycler could extend the lifetime of the synthetic oil by between 37% for TAN to 108% for TBN as the oil life determin- ing factors. The oil recycler also reduced the lubricating oil con- sumption by 24.5% and reduced the fuel consumption by 3.4% over the test period. 252</page><page sequence="252">2001-01-1970-2001-01-1977 2001-01-1970.

This paper reviews the development of a new standard for four- stroke diesel engine oils, JASO DH-1 (JASO M355: 2000). This standard was introduced to the market on April 1, 2001. It prescribes the minimum performance for engine oils conforming to four-stroke diesel engines manufactured by Japanese OEMs. This standard is composed of four engine tests and seven bench tests. The engine tests include a piston detergency test (JASO M336: 1998), valve train wear test (JASO M354: 1999), soot dispersancy test (ASTM D 5967-99) and high temperature antioxidation test (ASTM D 5533- 97a). The piston detergency test and the valve train wear test were developed in Japan. The bench tests measure hot surface deposits, anti-forming, volatility, anti-corrosion, shear-stability, total base number, and seal compatibility. 2001-01-1973. (SP- 1629) Instantaneous fuel flow rates mea- sured in high-pressure pipeline of gasoline direct-injection engine. Murad M. Ismailov, AutoSpace Corp. Transient dynamics of two injection flows, upstream and down- stream from a swirl injector, are investigated. Capillary n-heptane pipe flow is measured using laser doppler anemometer to obtain the instantaneous time series of centerline velocity and to reconstruct a series of instantaneous and integrated flow rates and pressure gra- dients. A collimated laser sheet and a high-speed video camera visu- alize injected spray flow. Finally, the phase doppler anemometer measurements are introduced to analyze instantaneous patterns of droplets, velocity-size and number density in the fuel spray. All measurements are employed at similar temporal resolution close to 30 jus. Results indicate that both flows are strongly time- dependent and well correlated in time-phases. Initial transitions are completed by 100 ps. Opening or closing of the injector valve affects both flows as strong delta oscillation causes spray penetra- tion dynamics and a post injection effect. A combination of non-intrusive laser-based techniques allows indication of the basic injection and spraying characteristics needed to optimize high-pressure fuel injectors and the late injection com- bustion mode. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1974.

This paper presents results from a comprehensive experimental study of high-pressure pressure-swirl gasoline injectors tested under a range of simulated operating conditions. This study encompassed photographic analysis of single spray sequences and simultaneous measurement of axial velocity, radial velocity and diameter at point locations using the phase-doppler technique. The combination of these measurement techniques permitted an insight into the fluid dynamics of the injected spray and its development with time. Five primary stages in the spray-history were identified and numerated with experimental data. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1975. (SP- 1629) Effects of fuel injection pressure in an optically-accessed DISI engine with side-mounted fuel injec- tor. Martin H. Davy and Paul A. Williams, University College Lon- don; and Richard W. Anderson, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents the results of an experimental study into the effects of fuel injection pressure on mixture formation within an optically accessed direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. Comparison is made between the spray characteristics and in- cylinder fuel distributions due to supply rail pressures of 50 bar and 100 bar subject to part- warm, part-load homogeneous charge operat- ing conditions. A constant fuel mass, corresponding to stoichiomet- ric tune, was maintained for both supply pressures. The injected sprays and their subsequent liquid-phase fuel distributions were visualized using the 2-D laser Mie-scattering technique. The experimental injector (nominally a hollow-cone pressure- swirl design) was seen to produce a dense filled spray structure for both injection pressures under investigation. In both cases, the lead- ing edge velocities of the main spray suggest the direct impingement of liquid fuel on the cylinder walls. The results indicate incomplete fuel vaporization at the time of spark for both supply pressures. In both cases, a dense fuel film was seen to be deposited on the piston crown during the compression stroke. Intermittent pool fires were seen on the piston crown in the region of the liquid film. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1976. (SP- 1629) Particulate characterization of a DISI research engine using a nephelometer and in-cylinder visu- alization. Darius Mehta, Terrence Alger, Matthew Hall, and Ron- ald Matthews, University of Texas ; and Henry Ng, Argonne National Labs. A nephelometer system was developed to characterize engine particulate emissions from DISI engines. Results were correlated with images showing the location and history of particulates in the cylinder of an optical engine. The nephelometer' s operation is based upon the dependence of scattered laser light on particulate size from a flow sampled from the exhaust of an engine. The nephelometer simultaneously measured the scattered light from angles of 20° to 160° from the forward scattering direction in 4° increments. The angular scattering measurements were then compared with calcula- tions using a Mie scattering code to infer information regarding par- ticulate size. Measurements of particulate mass were made based upon a correlation developed between the scattered light intensity and particulate mass samples trapped in a 0.2-micron filter. Measurements were made in a direct injection single-cylinder spark ignition research engine having a transparent quartz cylinder. The engine was operated at a speed of 1000 rpm at partial load with both late and early fuel injection timings. The nephelometer measurements were complimented with in- cylinder PM visualization using planar Mie scattering imaging. Cor- relations were attempted between the nephelometer engine-out PM measurements and the in-cylinder visualized PM. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1977.

The optimization of the vaporization and mixture formation pro- cess is of great importance for the development of modern gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, because it influences the subsequent processes of the ignition, combustion and pollutant formation signif- icantly. In consequence, the subject of this work was the develop- ment of a measurement technique based on the laser induced- 253</page><page sequence="253">2001-01-1977-2001-01-1983 exciplex fluorescence (LIF), which allows the two-dimensional visualization and quantification of the in-cylinder air/fuel ratio. A tracer concept consisting of benzene and triethylamine dis- solved in a non-fluorescent base fuel has been used. The calibration of the equivalence ratio proportional LIF-signal was performed directly inside the engine, at a well-known mixture composition, immediately before the direct injection measurements were started. Thus, it was possible to minimize crucial effects caused by window fouling, the non-uniformity of the laser illumination and finally the optical particularities of the setup. For comparison with the LIF results, Raman measurements were carried out simultaneously. In addition to different engine-operating points in the homogeneous regime, the mixture formation was also investigated at stratified charge. A comparison between the results of both measurement techniques shows very good agreement for cycle resolved measurements as well as for the mean values of the air/fuel ratios. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1978. (SP- 1629) Quantitative in-cylinder NO-LIF imaging in a direct-injected gasoline engine with exhaust gas recirculation. Wolfgang G. Bessler and Christof Schulz, University of Heidelberg; and Matthias Hartmann and Martin Schenk , BMW AG. The influence of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the forma- tion of nitric oxide (NO) was studied experimentally in a transparent gasoline direct injection engine by quantitative laser-induced fluo- rescence imaging. Spectral properties of the excited transition within the NO A2£'u+-X2ÀÀ(0,2) band are well known from previ- ous studies. The excitation scheme allows quantitative NO concen- tration measurements without detailed knowledge of the gas phase temperature. Good agreement was found with exhaust gas NOx chemi-luminescence (CLD) measurements. The experiments were carried out in an optically accessible gaso- line engine featuring a direct-injection cylinder head (BMW) and a Bosch injection system, based on a serial inline six-cylinder engine with an enlarged crankcase. The measurements were performed in the pent-roof section of the combustion chamber. Various concentrations (0, 10 and 16%) and compositions (pure nitrogen, nitrogen / carbon dioxide and nitrogen / carbon dioxide / water) of synthetic exhaust gas were investigated. NO formation could be significantly reduced by EGR, from an average of about 1200 ppm (without EGR) to about 200 ppm (16% EGR-rate). The NO formation decreased steadily with increasing heat capacity of the inert gases present, independent of their chemical composition. In the temporal evolution of the NO formation, a retarded onset of up to 5° CA was found with 16% EGR. The two-dimensional NO concentration fields appeared to be very homogeneous when adding 16% EGR, whereas without EGR, strong inhomogeneities with local NO peak concentrations of up to 3400 ppm were detected. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1979.

Fluid-dynamic steady-state characteristics and transient response of the control valve of high-pressure, electroni- cally controlled, injection systems are important factors for the con- trol of the shape, duration and timing of the injection, especially dur- ing pilot injections. Computed results, obtained using a model to predict the cavita- tion behavior of the control valve of a high-pressure fuel injection system for diesel engine, are presented. The numerical investigation has been made using different cavitation models, involving the hypothesis of a barotropic cavitation, or fluid dynamic model with non-equilibrium cavitation modeling. As a result, the computed mass flow values were compared with the experimental data. Calculations have been performed to investi- gate the influence of the transient development of the cavitation. The calculations showed that the control valve operate in transient condi- tions, especially during pilot injections. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1980. (SP- 1625) Optimization of high-pressure com- mon-rail electro-injector using genetic algorithms. Teresa Don- ateo, Arturo de Risi , and Domenico Laforgia, Università di Lecce. The aim of the present investigation is the implementation of an innovative procedure to optimize the design of a high-pressure com- mon-rail electro-injector. The optimization method is based on the use of genetic programming, a search procedure developed by John Holland at the University of Michigan. A genetic algorithm (GA) creates a random population which evolves combining the genetic code of the most capable individual of the previous generation. For the present investigation an algorithm which includes the operators of crossover, mutation and elitist reproduction has been developed. This genetic algorithm allows the optimization of both single and multicriteria problems. For the determination of the multi-objective fitness function, the concept of Pareto optimality has been imple- mented. The performance of the multiobjective genetic algorithm was examined by using appropriate mathematical functions and was compared with the single objective one. The proposed genetic algo- rithm was used to define the geometrical and dynamic characteris- tics of high-pressure injectors that optimize the injection profile and the time response of the system. As evaluation function for the GA a ID simulation code of injection systems, already developed and extensively tested by the authors, has been used. The ID model is based on the concentrated volume method and includes the effect of friction on the dynamics of the movable parts. The conservation equations were integrated by using the characteristic method. The electromagnetic force on the anchor of the injector has been simu- lated with an empirical function obtained by fitting experimental data. For the optimization the geometrical and dynamical data of a commercial five holes VCO injector were used as baseline case and the best combination of different groups of parameter has been found. The optimized combinations of the investigated parameters were compared with the original values of the commercial injector. Finally a feasibility analysis of the optimized parameters was performed. 2001-01-1981. (SP- 1625) Model-based determination of dynamic engine control function parameters. Michael Hafner, Darmstadt University of Technology. The use of model-based approaches in areas such as simulation, control design, optimization, etc., is crucial for the development of highly sophisticated systems. This is especially true for typically very tight time-to-market frames. Physical modeling of IC engine emissions based on first principles is extremely complex and still requires by far too much calculation time. However, special fast neural networks represent a promising alternative for an accurate modeling of the emission behavior, even for dynamic conditions. This paper first describes the process of developing dynamic neural emission models. The required data is collected by a specially designed dynamic measurement strategy. The models themselves are then used for the optimization of the dynamic engine behavior concerning consumption, emissions and drivability. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1983. (SP- 1625) Transient cavitating flow simula- tions inside a 2-D VCO nozzle using the space-time CE/SE method. Jian-Rong Qin, S. T. John Yu, and Zeng-Chan Zhang, Wayne State Univ.; and Ming-Chia Lai, Wayne State University. Cavitating flows inside a two-dimensional valve covered orifice (VCO) nozzle were simulated by using the Space-Time Conserva- tion Element and Solution Element (CE/SE) method in conjunction with a homogeneous equilibrium cavitation model. As a validation 254</page><page sequence="254">2001-01-1983-2001-01-1989 for present model, cavitation over a NACA0015 hydrofoil was pre- dicted and compared with previous simulation results as well as experimental observations. The model was then used to investigate the effects on internal cavitating flows of different nozzle design parameters, such as the hole size, hole aspect-ratio, hydro-erosion radius, and orifice inclination. Under different conditions, cavitating flows through fuel injectors generated hydraulic flip, supercavita- tion, full cavitation, and cyclical cavitation phenomena, which are commonly observed in experiments. Different global cavitation inception processes were also demonstrated in the present study, including boundary layer separation, vortex explosion, and suction force over curvy surfaces. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1984. (SP- 1625) Dynamic application of a skeletal mechanism for DI diesel NOx emissions. M. A. Psota and A. M. Mellor, Vanderbilt Univ. A skeletal mechanism for NOx emissions is incorporated into a cycle simulation code for direct-injection (DI) diesel engines. The skeletal mechanism consists of seven chemical reactions associated with the extended Zeldovich and N2O mechanisms. In combining the skeletal mechanism with the cycle simulation code, both a two- and a one-zone combustion model are examined. In the former, NO forms in zone 1 , which is characterized by the stoichiometric flame temperature, and decomposes in zone 2, which is represented by the overall bulk cylinder temperature. For the one-zone combustion model, it is postulated that both the NO formation and decomposi- tion processes are characterized by the stoichiometric flame temper- ature. The main objective of this work is to examine the relative contri- bution of the Zeldovich and N2O mechanisms to the NO formation and decomposition processes occurring during diesel combustion. Furthermore, comparisons are made between predicted and mea- sured NOx values from four DI diesel engines. For the two-zone modeling results, a correlation was found between predicted and measured NOx values for all engines examined, and the inclusion of the N2O mechanism slightly improves such a correlation. How- ever, the bulk temperature is found to be too low to allow for the reactions associated with NO decomposition to proceed. A correlation could also be obtained for measured NOx values when a one-zone model was used. However, such predictions require empirical selection of the amount of NO available to decom- pose and indicate that the N2O mechanism does not contribute to the net NO generation process in a one-zone stoichiometric model. Therefore, it is concluded that the two-zone model is more robust. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1985. (SP- 1625) Simulating analysis of methanol combustion process and variations of cycle to cycle in diesel engine. Yiquan Huang , Qingyun Su Zheng Huang , Junjie Zhou, and Minghua Yang, Dalian University of Technology. A zero-dimension combustion model suitable to multi-fuel com- bustion process has been developed and successfully used in the analysis of methanol combustion process. The V2b function is calcu- lated with the Powell Optimized Algorithm. The concerned charac- teristics include in the variables of zero-dimension model, mean indication pressure, maximum combustion pressure, ignition delay and the correlation coefficient between heat release rate and ignition delay. The heat release rate curves on different conditions are fitted and the statistic analyses of the cyclic variations are conducted. 2001-01-1986. (SP- 1624) The establishment of laboratory test method for gelation of engine-oil-containing magnesium deter- gents. Yasushi Naitoh and Noriyuki Naganuma, Japan Energy Corp.; and Kenyu Akiyama and Hiroo Sagami, Toyota Motor Corp. It has been reported that engine oils containing magnesium deter- gents gel under special conditions. The authors have previously reported on the mechanism by which magnesium detergents form needle crystals, which is the main cause of the gelation. For this arti- cle, the authors conducted tests in actual vehicles using several types of engine oils containing magnesium detergents, including oils for which gelation problems have been reported in the market. The gela- tion was reproduced, and the test oils were ranked by their propen- sity to gel. In addition, a laboratory test method was used in which water and CO2 were mixed into engine oil under controlled condi- tions, then left stored in a bottle for twenty days, after which the kinematic viscosity and the quantity of insolubles of the mixture were measured. The study demonstrated the correlation between the laboratory test method and the actual vehicle tests. The test method makes it possible to clarify the evaluation standards which can be applied to the existing magnesium detergents to prevent engine oil gelation problems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1987. (SP-1624) Design tools for prediction of valve recession and solving valve/seat failure problems. R. Lewis and R. S. Dwyer- Joyce, University of Sheffield. Although new materials and production techniques are being developed to reduce valve and seat wear, these advances have been outpaced by demands for increased engine performance. At present no rules exist to arrive at a satisfactory valve life. Each wear prob- lem, therefore, has to be investigated, the cause isolated and reme- dial action taken. The objective of this work was to develop design and failure analysis tools for use in industry to assess the potential for valve recession and solve problems that occur more quickly. A semi-empirical wear model for predicting valve recession has been developed based on data gathered from laboratory simulation experiments. A software program, RECESS, was developed to run the model. Model predictions are compared with engine dynamome- ter tests and bench tests. The model can be used to give a quantita- tive prediction of the valve recession to be expected with a particular material pair or a qualitative assessment of how parameters need to be altered in order to reduce recession. Flow charts have been developed, based on a review of literature, failure analysis and modeling carried out, to assist in diagnosing and rectifying valve/seat failures and to help in reducing valve recession by design. The valve recession model and design tools can be integrated into an industrial environment in order to help reduce costs and timescales involved in solving valve/seat wear problems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-1988. (SP-1624) Study of rheological effects on the lubrication of infinitely-wide slider bearings. P. F. Silva, J. C. Dias, V. A. Schwarz, and M. T. Neves, Escola Federal de Engen- haria de Itajubá. The one-dimensional Reynolds equation modified to non- Newtonian power law fluids is obtained, by using the small pertur- bation method. Further this equation is analytically solved, giving the pressure distribution, load capacity, friction force and friction coefficient, as functions of the specific tapering of the bearing. An error analysis is also made, to find the working conditions where the modified equation may be applied with a relatively small error. Finally, the behavior of infinitely-wide rectangular shoes hydrody- namic slider bearings is analyzed by using lubricating oils with rheological characteristic index n&gt;l (dilatant lubricants) and nel (pseudoplastic lubricants), as well as n=l (Newtonian lubricants). 2001-01-1989. (SP-1624) Numerical investigations of the EHL performance of the piston ring with the consideration of the two-dimensional deformation of the cylinder liner. Zhang Yong, South China University of Tech. One of the most important research areas in tribology that affects the reliability, fuel economy and emissions of an internal combus- tion engine is the lubrication and wear of the piston ring - cylinder liner. In this paper, two-dimensional transient EHL analysis is developed for the lubrication analysis of the piston ring with the consideration of the two-dimensional deformation of the cylinder 255</page><page sequence="255">2001-01-1989-2001-01-1997 liner. The forming of the lubricant film and the characteristics of the pressure distribution on the piston ring surface are studied. The effects of the deformation of the cylinder liner are discussed. The calculated results show that the EHL performance of the piston ring significantly depends on the deformation of the cylinder liner. The paper may provide some insights for the analysis of the lubrication performance of the piston ring. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1991. Oxidation stability of automatic transmission fluids - A study by the International Lubricants Standardiza- tion and Approval Committee (ILSAC) ATF Subcommittee. Hiroko Ohtani, Pierre A. Willermet , and Joseph W. Sprys, Ford Motor Co.; James L. Linden and John E. Flaherty , General Motors Corp.; Tracey E. King , DaimlerChrysler Corp.; Minoru Kagawa , Fuji Heavy Industry Co ., Ltd.; Mitsumasa Furumoto, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; Shin-ichi Iwamoto, Mazda Motor Corp.; Hideo Kurashina, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.; Takumaru Sagawa, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Hiroyuki Arai, Toyota Motor Corp. The International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Com- mittee (ILSAC) ATF subcommittee members have compared the two oxidation bench test methods, Aluminum Beaker Oxidation Test (ABOT) and Indiana Stirring Oxidation Stability Test (ISOT), using a number of factory-fill and service-fill ATFs obtained in Japan and in the US. In many cases, the ATFs were more severely oxidized after the ABOT procedure than after the same duration of the ISOT procedure. The relative severity of these two tests was influenced by the composition of the ATFs. The bench test oxida- tion data were compared with the transmission and the vehicle oxi- dation test data. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1992. The impact of evolving automatic transmission fluid specifications on base oil selection. R. F. Watts, J. R. Noles, N. Pujara, and T. R. Trautman, Inflneum USA LP. Automatic transmission fluid (ATF) performance is determined by the choice of lubricant basestocks and additives used to formulate the fluid. The lubricant basestocks employed set the fundamental low temperature capabilities and resistance to oxidation of the fluid. Over the last decade, ATF specifications issued by the major North American transmission builders have required significant improve- ments in low temperature fluidity and oxidation stability. These required improvements have begun to limit the number of bases- tocks capable of producing suitable fluids. The practical impact of this evolution is that API Group I basestocks are rapidly becoming incapable of producing the new generation of ATFs. Recently issued, and proposed, specifications will clearly continue this trend. Future ATF formulations may well be forced to move to API Group II, Group III and/or synthetic base fluids to meet these increasing performance requirements. 2001 SAE Transections Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1993. Detergent and friction modifier effects on metal/metal and clutch material/metal frictional performance. Thomas S. Derevjanik, Lubrizol Corp. The goal of this work was to find combinations of detergent and friction modifier additives that would produce high metal/metal fric- tion with good clutch material performance. A baseline formulation was used with various combinations of five different detergents with five different friction modifiers. Two bench tests were used to assess performance. A CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) Ele- ment-on-Ring Test was used to study metal/metal performance, and a VSFT (Variable Speed Friction Tester) procedure with cellulose based friction material was used to evaluate the p-v (friction coeffi- cient-velocity) clutch performance. Interestingly, a 400 TBN mag- nesium sulfonate detergent combined with a phosphorus containing friction modifier showed a special synergy. The metal/metal, ele- ment-on-ring data showed one of the highest average friction coeffi- cients, and the VSFT results showed that this combination also dis- played a moderately high dynamic friction coefficient with a high, positive jLt-v slope. The positive slope is indicative of good clutch material antishudder performance. Even after prestressing (fluid aging), this combination was one of the few formulations that main- tained a moderately high positive slope with a moderate dynamic coefficient of friction over the entire range of temperatures studied. In conclusion, this paper documents the full bench test results of all the different detergent and friction modifier combinations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1994. Viscometric characteristics of viscosity index improvers - Structural changes in PAO solutions at low temper- ature. Noely Francisca Pereira and Maria Adelina Santos Araújo, PETROBRAS Research and Development Center ; and Alberto Cláudio Habert, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. Formulation at low temperatures becomes difficult when wax crystallization occurs, which modifies the oil viscosity-temperature behavior. In this work, we studied the isolated influence of VIF s in Theo- logical characteristics of lubricants, using polyalphaolefin (PAO-4) as a wax free base oil. Brookfield viscosity results of the pure PAO-4 were compared to those of the VII solutions, in four concen- trations, from -10°C to -40°C. The VII thickening power was determined for two commercial polymers from their reduced and intrinsic viscosities in PAO-4 solu- tions. These parameters were then used to analyze the low tempera- ture behavior of formulated ATF' s with two kinds of base oils, one Group II and one Group III. The studied VII' s are available in Brazil for the formulation of ATF fluids. 2001-01-1995. (SP- 1631) Particulate erosion of automotive catalyst supports. J. Paul Day, Corning Incorporated. A concern has been expressed regarding the durability of the ceramic thin-wall and ultra-thin-wall substrates under severe ther- mal and mechanical conditions. Damage that might result from these conditions would most likely lead to a reduction in catalyst performance. One of the potential damage mechanisms for automo- tive catalysts is erosion resulting from the impingement of particles onto the front face of the catalyst system. A basic study of the partic- ulate erosion phenomenon of cellular ceramic substrates was undertaken in order to determine, in a controlled setting, the sub- strate, particulate, and flow conditions that might bring this damage about. This report will discuss a room temperature study of the effects of particle size, particle density, gas flow rate, cellular part orientation, and cellular design parameters on the erosion of ceramic substrates. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1996. (SP- 1631) A study of the effect of flow pulsa- tions on the flow distribution within ceramic contoured catalyst substrates. S. F. Benjamin, C. A. Roberts, and J. Wollin, Coventry Univ. This study examines the effect of pulsating flow on the flow dis- tribution through contoured substrates. Three ceramic contoured substrates of equal volume were assessed. Two of the substrates were cone shaped with different cone angles and one had a dome- shaped front face. The flow distribution was measured for a range of flow rates and pulsation frequencies. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were also performed. It is shown how a contoured substrate can provide improvements in flow uniformity and that they are less sensitive to changes in flow rate and pulsation frequency when compared to the case of a standard substrate. Improvements in the prediction of flow distribution are reported when substrate 'entrance effects' are accounted for. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-1997.

(SP- 1631) Aldehyde emissions from an etha- nol-fuelled vehicle as influenced by engine geometric parame- ters. Rinaldo Antunes Amaral , FIAT Automobile; and José Ricardo Sodré , Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. Experiments were carried out in an ethanol-fuelled vehicle pow- ered by a 1.0-liter engine to measure exhaust aldehyde and other pollutant gases, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, as a function of some engine geometric parame- ters. The varied parameters were intake and exhaust valve timing, compression ratio and spark plug gap. The tests were developed according to a standard test cycle of 5.8 km, simulating a typical urban travel with an already warmed engine. The results showed the that higher compression ratios can simultaneously reduce aldehyde, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, while keeping the level of oxides of nitrogen emissions. 2001-01-1999. (SP- 1631) Fuel permeation performance of polymeric materials. Mark Nulman, Albert Olejnik , Marsha Samus, Ed Fead, and Giuseppe Rossi, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents an extensive set of permeation data on auto- motive fuel system materials. It adds significantly to the information provided by the same authors in SAE paper 983160. The permeation measurements refer to three different test fuels: fuel C, CE 10 and CM 15 at 40, 50 and 60°C. The materials examined include poly eth- ylenes, nylons, polyketons, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers, ace- táis, fluoropolymers and fluoroelastomers. These data are important in the design of automotive fuel system components capable of meeting LEVII or PZEV requirements. In particular, data of this kind are crucial in optimizing the permeation performance of mul- tilayer structures for fuel system applications. 2001-01-2000. (SP- 1631) Experimental investigation of emis- sion control from spark-ignition engine using electrically heated catalyst. S. Sendil velan, K. Jeyachandran, and K. Bhaskar, Anna Univ. This paper deals with the development and performance of the Electrically Heated Catalytic (EHC) converter with copper oxide as a catalyst in a spark-ignition (SI), gasoline-fueled engine. It is found that the EHC reduces cold-start hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon mon- oxide (CO) emission, when used with existing catalytic converter. From this, the potential of catalytic systems with copper oxide as catalyst is analyzed. Various parameters have been analyzed with the available experimental data, with the help of multiple regression analysis. It is found that the agreement between the analyzed and experimental result is satisfactory. Therefore, it is concluded that, the equation developed in this study can be used with confidence to analyze the emission performance. 2001-01-2001. (SP- 1631) Sulfur control for NOx sorbate cata- lysts: Sulfur sorbate catalysts and desulfation. Jim Parks, Aaron Watson, Greg Campbell, and Greg Wagner, Goal Line Environmen- tal Technologies LLC; and Mike Cunningham, Neal Currier, Tom Gallant, and George Muntean, Cummins Engine Co. NOx sorbate, or 'trap,' catalysts have achieved &gt;90% reduction of NOx from lean exhaust streams over a broad range of tempera- tures. Since diesel can be used as the reductant for NOx sorbate cata- lysts, the sorbate catalyst technology offers great potential for NOx control in a broad range of mobile diesel applications. Traditionally, the longevity of NOx sorbate catalysts in diesel exhaust applications has been limited by sulfur masking of NOx sorption sites. Two methods to control sulfur compounds and their associated effects will be presented here. Upstream sulfur sorbate, or 'trap,' catalysts are used to control the rate of sulfur masking by diverting sulfur away from the NOx sorbate catalyst. Desulfation of NOx sorbate catalysts can lead to the removal of sulfur compounds from the cata- lyst and reactivation of NOx sorption sites. Data demonstrating sul- fur control with both of these methods will be presented here. The effect of temperature on sulfur control and thereby NOx sorbate cat- alyst longevity will be discussed. 2001-01-2002. (SP-1631) Influence of vehicle test cycle char- acteristics on fuel consumption and emissions of city buses. Luc Pelkmans, Dirk De Keukeleere, Hans Bruneel, and Guido Lenaers, Vito, Flemish Institute for Technological Research. While engine test procedures are mainly applied to verify and ensure compliance to the various emission standards, vehicle test procedures were developed to simulate the vehicle in actual service (including engine, drive train and chassis). These drive cycles are usually performed on a chassis dynamometer, but can also be per- formed on test track. The results are expressed in grams of pollutant per unit of distance (g/km). Examples of vehicle test cycles, which are mainly focused at city buses, are the time-based Central Busi- ness District Cycle (CBDC) and the Dutch Urban Bus Driving Cycle (DUBDC) and the distance-based Belgian City Cycle of the public Transport Company 'De Lijn.' In the frame of the IEA-AMF project 'Real Impact of New Tech- nologies for Heavy Duty Vehicles,' three state-of-the-art city bus technologies were evaluated for fuel consumption and emissions both in real city traffic and in the mentioned vehicle test cycles. The three buses were a diesel bus, a natural gas bus with stoichiometric fuel control and three-way catalyst, and a natural gas bus with lean burn fuel control. The purpose of the project was to look for clear relations between various test cycles in the IEA-AMF countries and the correspondence of these cycles with real traffic. The results show that the relation between real-city traffic and simulated city cycles differs from technology to technology. The acceleration capabilities of the bus are found to be very important, and the acceleration requirements of the simulated city cycle should match the actual capabilities of the bus. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2003. (SP- 1630) Correlation between flame pattern, heat-release and emissions for a DI diesel engine with rotating injector and variable swirl. Magnus Sjöberg, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). A diesel fuel injector has been modified to allow rotation around its axis, driven by an electric motor. This enables sweeping injec- tions in a DI diesel combustion system. It has earlier been shown that sweeping injection enhances the air entrainment into the spray. This is one reason for the reduced smoke level by counter-swirl rota- tion of the injector. The injected amount of fuel is small and this enables exploration of spray/wall interaction and the effects of reverse-squish. Flame visualization shows that normal, non-sweeping injection tends to build up fuel pockets where the sprays hit the piston bowl wall. This fuel burns quite slowly since it only to a limited extent benefits from the mixing effects of the reverse-squish flow. Increasing the air swirl ratio from 1 .65 to 2.47 does not reduce the impact onto the piston bowl wall much. The decrease in smoke level with increasing swirl was attributed to enhanced mixing of the fuel that had accumulated under the piston bowl rim. This speeded up the burnout. Counter-swirl rotation of the injector markedly reduces the impact onto the piston bowl wall. This led to faster combustion and lower smoke level. This shows that fuel located along the wall burns slowly and contribute preferentially to engine-out soot. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 257</page><page sequence="257">2001-01-1997-2001-01-2009 2001-01-2004. (SP- 1630) Glow-plug-assisted ignition and combustion of methanol in an optical DI Diesel engine. Charles J. Mueller and Mark P. Musculus , Sandia National Laboratories. An experimental study of the glow-plug-assisted ignition and combustion of pure methanol (Ml 00) was conducted using a mod- ern-technology, 4-stroke, heavy-duty DI diesel engine that has been modified to provide extensive optical access into the combustion chamber. For comparison purposes, results also are presented for a two-component paraffinic diesel reference fuel with a cetane num- ber of 45 (CN45). A 1200-rpm, moderate-load operating condition was studied. Images of direct luminosity from the combustion chamber are used along with thermodynamic analyses of cylinder pressure data to identify differences between the ignition and com- bustion characteristics of the two fuels. The M 100 data show significant departures from the traditional diesel combustion features exhibited by CN45. Whereas CN45 read- ily autoignites at the conditions studied, M 100 does not. The glow- plug-assisted ignition of M 100 was found to be strongly dependent on glow plug (GP) temperature and proximity to a fiiel jet. The direct luminosity images show that M 100 ignition occurs at the GP, followed by combustion propagation first to the two jets straddling the GP, then to the adjacent two jets, and finally to the last two jets emanating from the 6-hole, centrally-located injector nozzle. Three spikes in the apparent heat release rate are observed to correspond to these pair- wise jet ignition events. Spatially integrating the direct luminosity image data suggests that in-cylinder soot concentrations during M 100 combustion are at least 2 orders of magnitude lower than those during CN45 combustion. Peak heat release rates during M 100 combustion are only half of those achieved during the pre- mixed burn phase of CN45 combustion, resulting in noticeably qui- eter engine operation. 2001-01-2005. (SP-1630) Combustion visualization of DI die- sel spray combustion inside a small-bore cylinder under differ- ent EGR and swirl ratios. Pai-Hsiu Lu, Joong-Sub Han, Ming - Chia Lai, and Naein A. Henein, Wayne State Univ.; and Walter Bryzik, US TARDEC. An experimental setup using rapid compression machine to pro- vide excellent optical access to visualize simulated high-speed small-bore direct-injection diesel engine combustion processes is described. Typical combustion visualization results of diesel spray combustion under different EGR, swirl, and injection pressure and nozzle conditions are presented. Different swirl intensities are achieved using an air nozzle with variable orientations and a check valve to connect the compression chamber and the combustion chamber. Different EGR ratios are achieved by pre-injection of die- sel fuel prior to the main observation sequence. Clear visualization of the high-pressure fuel injection, ignition, combustion and spray/ wall/swirl interactions is obtained. The injection system is a high- pressure common-rail system with either a VCO or a mini-sac noz- zle. High-speed movies up to 35,000 frame-per-second are taken using a framing drum camera to record the combustion events. Combustion luminosity was used to qualify the combustion and sooting processes. Heat release analysis was also carried out. The results confirm earlier engine combustion results, which show that EGR decreases the heat-release rate and increases the soot forma- tion. Wall interaction with spray plume is identified as a major soot formation contributor. Higher injection pressure does not always provide better soot emission results at high EGR conditions, due to wall interactions. Therefore, the soot-NOx trade-off relations should be optimized with injection pressure and swirl ratio in small-bore high-speed diesel engines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2006. (SP-1630) Study of model-based cooperative control of EGR and VGT for a low-temperature, premixed com- bustion diesel engine. Takashi Shirawaka, Manabu Miura, Hiroyuki Itoyama, Eiji Aiyoshizawa, and Shuji Kimura, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A low-temperature, premixed combustion concept, called Modu- lated Kinetics (MK) combustion, has been developed that reduces emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and smoke simultaneously. This new combustion concept requires heavy exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to reduce the NOx emission and combustion noise. However, there is an interaction between the effects of controlling exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and the variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). This makes controlling both the EGR rate and air mass flow rate more difficult under transient operating conditions. Therefore, the authors investigated a cooperative control of EGR and VGT in an effort to control the accuracy of both the EGR rate and the air mass flow rate. This paper presents an approach through the application of a control system CAD program and rapid prototyping tools to improve transient operating states by referring to a model-based EGR and VGT control algorithm. Furthermore, a prototype car was used to clarify the effect of the algorithm that was built through the simulation. The results of simulation and experiment, which demon- strate the effectiveness of this optimized transient control, are described. 2001-01-2008. (SP-1630) The structure of cavitation and its effect on the spray pattern in a single-hole diesel nozzle. Lionel Christopher Ganippa, Göran Bark, Sven Andersson, and Jerzy Chomiak, Chalmers University of Technology. The structure and evolution of cavitation in a transparent scaled-up diesel nozzle having a hole perpendicular to the nozzle axis has been investigated using high-speed motion pictures, flash photography and stroboscopie visualization. Observations revealed that, at the inception stage, cavitation bubbles are dominantly seen in the vortices at the boundary layer shear flow and outside the sepa- ration zone. Cavitation bubbles grow intensively in the shear layer and develop into cloud-like coherent structures when viewed from the side of the nozzle. Shedding of the coherent cloud cavitation was observed. When the flow was increased further the cloud-like cavi- tation bubbles developed into a large-scale coherent structure extending downstream of the hole. Under this condition the cavita- tion starts as a mainly glassy sheet at the entrance of the hole. Until this stage the spray appeared to be symmetric. When the flow was increased beyond this stage, a sheet of cavitation covered a signifi- cant part of the hole on one side, extending to the hole exit. A glossy sheet on the other side of the hole does not extend to the hole exit. This non- symmetric distribution of cavitation within the hole resulted in a jet, which atomized on the side towards the right of the hole and a non-atomizing jet on the left of the hole. Any further increase in the flow resulted in a total sheet cavitation structure within the nozzle hole and the same asymmetric spray pattern. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2009. (SP-1630) Analysis of a diesel spray using a mechanical slicing device. Andreas Cronhjort and Dennis Kon- stanzer, Royal Institute of Technology. This paper gives a summary of image velocimetry measurements performed in a sliced diesel spray. The slicing of the spray was nec- essary to achieve sufficient image quality in the more dense regions of the spray. The images were double exposed to allow auto- correlation based velocimetry. The illumination was achieved with a xenon flashlight behind the spray and consequently the droplets were visible as dark shadows. Images were acquired from different points downstream from the nozzle, and a number of different radii were employed at every posi- tion. In the images the smaller droplets seem to be spherical, while the larger ones are distorted due to high weber numbers. Computer simulations indicate that large droplets may reach high weber num- bers when passing through the slit, and that some of these large droplets break up. Simulations were also used to estimate how much the velocity of the droplets was affected by the slicing device, and accordingly the expected reduction in velocity does not exceed 30 % for the smallest droplets. Considering this, an acceptable agree- ment was found between velocities measured with the slicing device 258</page><page sequence="258">2001-01-2009-2001-01-2014 and velocity data found in the literature. Therefore, it is concluded that the slicing device used in this paper gives new valuable infor- mation about the internal structures in dense diesel sprays. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2010. (SP- 1630) Diesel combustion with reduced nozzle orifice diameter. Pär Bergstrand , Volvo Truck Corp.; and Ingemar Denbratt, Chalmers University of Technology. Future emission legislation will require substantial reductions of NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions from diesel engines. The combustion and emission formation in a diesel engine is gov- erned mainly by spray formation and mixing. Important parameters governing these are droplet size, distribution, concentration and injection velocity. Smaller orifices are believed to give smaller droplet size, even with reduced injection pressure, which leads to better fuel atomization, faster evaporation and better mixing. In this paper experiments are performed on a single-cylinder heavy-duty direct injection diesel engine with three nozzles of dif- ferent orifice diameters (1)0.227 mm, (1)0.130 mm, (1)0.090 mm). Two loads (low and medium) and three speeds were investigated. The test results confirmed a substantial reduction in HC and soot emissions at lower loads for the small orifices. At medium loads, the soot and CO emissions increase which makes the smaller orifice a disadvan- tage compared with the reference nozzle (1)0.227 mm). This could be caused by a lower local air-fuel ratio in the combustion zone, since more fuel is injected at increased loads and smaller orifices have a shorter fuel penetration leading to decreased air utilization. It has also been observed that the smaller the orifice, the shorter the ignition delay. The smaller orifices also improve the mixing, which is shown by shorter combustion duration. This results in reduction of the heat and time losses, resulting in a higher thermal efficiency, i.e., lower fuel consumption. One of the nozzles with smaller orifices (1)0.130 mm) has improved combustion for all of the test cases, resulting in an increase in fuel conversion efficiency com- pared to the reference nozzle (1)0.227 mm). The results from the experimental tests show that the benefits of a well-distributed spray with small droplets produced by smaller orifices can be substantial in diesel combustion. 2001-01-2011. (SP-1630) Study of the influence of the injec- tion parameters on combustion noise in a common-rail diesel engine using ANOVA and neural networks. Paolo Carlucci , Antonio Ficarella, and Domenico Laf orgia, University of Lecce. The influence of some injection parameters (as main injection timing, pilot injection timing, pilot injection duration) on noise emissions and combustion noise level of a diesel engine has been evaluated. The noise emissions of an in-line, four-cylinder, turbo- charged FIAT 1929 cm3 TDI engine were measured using an ambi- ent microphone and accelerometers. The injection system of the engine used was the high-pressure common-rail system. The experi- mental results were elaborated using an ANOVA (analysis of vari- ance) technique, to evaluate the influence of the control parameters on the controlled ones. Moreover, a multi-layer neural network was used to predict noise emissions and vibration level. It was found that the accelerometer mounted on the top of the engine bolt, which clamped the head of the cylinder to the crankcase, gave the best coherence of the results. The timing of the main injection influences on noise, while the influence of timing and duration of the pilot injection on noise shows different behavior for different fuel injected quantities. 2001-01-2012. (SP-1630) Evaluation of the effects of water injection in a single-cylinder CFR cetane engine. S. Brusca and R. Lanzafame, University of Catania. Water injection effects on combustion phenomena have been investigated for several years, from both a theoretical and experi- mental viewpoints due to the collaboration of AGIP PETROLI and ISAB ERG Refinery. In this paper the effects of water injection on diesel combustion are investigated and reported. Using single-cylinder CFR engine Cetane (AGIP PRIOLO Engine 1 1361/1) cetane number (C.N.) and NOx emissions have been measured. Tests were performed according to ASTM Cetane Method (ASTM X2.7.4). Water was supplied by a continuous injection sys- tem. The engine was fed with a base diesel oil from DA 1302 Refin- ery plant. The water-to-fuel mass ratio was varied in the range of Oto 1.5. Apparent heat release and fuel mass burning rate analysis of the in-cylinder pressure data were carried out. The results of in-cylinder pressure data analysis have shown the effects of internal refrigera- tion on the compression work and on the combustion phenomena. The pollutant emissions measurements were performed by AGIP PETROLI Laboratory. NOx emissions reduction confirm the effec- tiveness of water injection in reducing the engine environmental impact. Results have shown that water injection really represent a new way to control NOx formation in Diesel Engine and to reduce com- pression work. 2001-01-2013. (SP- 1632) Dimethyl ether (DME)- Assessment of viscosity using the new volatile fuel viscometer (VFVM). Ion M. Sivebaek and Spencer C. Sorenson, Technical Uni- versity of Denmark; and Joergen Jakobsen, Oestervang 16. This paper describes the development and test of a viscometer capable of handling dimethyl ether (DME) and other volatile fuels. DME has excellent combustion characteristics in diesel engines but the injection equipment can break down prematurely due to extensive wear when handling this fuel. It was established, in earlier work, that the wear in the pumps is substantial even if the lubricity of DME is raised to a believed acceptable level using anti-wear additives. An influence of the viscosity on the wear in the pumps was sus- pected. The problem, up to now, was that the viscosity of DME has only been estimated or calculated but never actually measured. In the present work a volatile fuel viscometer (VFVM) was developed. It is of the capillary type and it was designed to handle DME, neat or additised. The kinematic and dynamic viscosities of pure DME were measured at 0.185 cSt and 0.122 cP at 25°C respec- tively. The VFVM established that low concentrations of additives do not affect the viscosity of DME significantly. This is the case even when the additive has a high viscosity or is solid at ambient temper- ature. The viscosity of DME blends can reach that of diesel oil but only when the additive is present in very large proportions. It is not believed that reasonably additised DME can reach the same viscosity and lubricity as diesel oil. The solution is rather to design the pumps so they can handle pure DME. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2014. (SP- 1632) Flame temperature correlation of emissions from diesels operated on alternative fuels. W. L. Easley and A. M. Mellor, Vanderbilt Univ.; and T. P. Gardner , Ford Motor Co. Work by Plee, Ahmad, and coworkers in the 1980s showed that for changes in intake air state, Diesel NOx, soot, soluble organic fraction, and HC emissions could be correlated using the stoichio- metric flame temperature calculated at SOC or peak pressure condi- tions. In the present work, similar flame temperature correlations are obtained for emissions from three test engines; a 1.2L high-speed direct-injection (HSDI) Diesel, a 2.4L HSDI diesel, and a 2.34 L single-cylinder direct-injection (DI) Diesel engine, the first of which was tested using four alternative fuels. Use of the flame temperature correlations presented may reduce the number of engine tests required to evaluate the effects of EGR on emissions of NOx, partic- ulate, and HC, even when alternative fuels are used. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 259</page><page sequence="259">2001-01-2015-2001-01-2020 2001-01-2015. (SP- 1632) Production feasible DME technol- ogy for direct-injection CI engines. Denis Gill and Herwig Ofner, AVL List GmbH; and Eddie Sturman , John Carpenter , and Marc Andrew Wolverton, Sturman Industries , Inc. DiMethyl Ether (DME) has been shown to be a very attractive fuel for low-emission direct-injection compression-ignition (DICI) engines. It combines the advantages of the high efficiencies of diesel cycle engines with soot free combustion. However, its greatest drawback is the need to develop new fuel injection and handling systems. Previous approaches have been common-rail-type injection sys- tems which have shown great potential in reducing harmful exhaust emissions and achieving good engine performance and efficiency due to good control of both the fuel injection characteristics and temperature. The concept also has proven benefits with respect to convenient and safe fuel handling. The logical evolution of this con- cept simplifies the fuel system and avoids special components for DME handling such as high pressure rail pumps while retaining all the benefits of the common rail principle. This system uses hydraulically intensified fuel injectors driven by oil in a common-rail concept using digital valve technology. Such an approach shifts the high pressure to the oil which is more convenient in its handling than DME. Furthermore, amplifier pis- tons enable significantly higher injection pressures to be achieved while maintaining fuel pressures outside the injector at moderate levels. 2001-01-2016. (SP- 1632) Injector nozzle coking with oxygen- ated diesel. Michael C. Mendoza , Qin Zhang , Alan C. Hansen , and John F. Reid ', University of Illinois. The use of substances other than petroleum-based fuels for power sources is not a new concept. Prior to the advent of petroleum fueled vehicles numerous other substances were used to create mobile sources of power. As the world's petroleum supply dwin- dles, alternative fuel sources are sought after to replace petroleum fuels. Many industries are particularly interested in the development of renewable fuel sources, or biologically derived fuel sources, which includes ethanol. The use of No. 2 diesel as well as many alternative fuels in com- pression ignition engines result in injector coking. Injector coking can severely limit engine performance by limiting the amount of fuel delivered to the combustion chamber and altering the spray pat- tern. Injector tip coking is also one of the most sensitive measures of diesel fuel quality. A machine vision system was implemented to quantify injector coking accumulation when a compression ignition engine was fueled with oxy diesel. The results show a decrease in injector coking over 200 hours of engine operation when fueled with oxydiesel compared to the coking found after a 20-hour degreening period with No. 2 diesel. 2001-01-2017. (SP-1632) Performance and emissions of a common-rail DI diesel engine using fossil and different bio- derived fuels. Carlo N. Grimaldi, Francesco Mariani, and Lucio Postrioti, University of Perugia. The recent introduction of electronic-controlled, high-pressure injection systems has deeply changed the scenario for light-duty, automotive diesel engines. This change is mainly due to the enhanced flexibility in obtaining the desired injection law (time his- tory and injected fuel quantity), while high injection pressures also favor a suitable mixture formation. This results in higher engine per- formance (efficiency and power) and in better pollutant emissions control. At the same time, in order to reduce the greenhouse gases net production, research is analyzing alternative resources, such as bio- derived fuels. In particular, methyl esters derived by different vege- table oils are characterized by high cetane numbers and very small sulfur content. The present work reports the results of a comparative analysis performed on a modern DI, common-rail, turbocharged engine by using three different bio-derived fuels (rape seed, soybean, waste cooked oil) and conventional fossil diesel fuel. 2001-01-2018. (SP-1632) Emissions from a 5.9-liter diesel engine fueled with ethanol diesel blends. Michael D . Kass, John F. Thomas, John M. Storey, Norberto Domingo, and James Wade, Oak Ridge National Laboratory ; and Glenn Kenreck, Betz- Dearborn, Inc. A certification diesel fuel and blends containing 10 and 15 vol- ume % ethanol were tested in a 5.9-liter Cummins B Series engine. For each fuel blend, an 8-mode AVL test cycle was performed. The resulting emissions were characterized and measured for each indi- vidual test mode (prescribed combination of engine speed and load). These individual mode results are used to create a weighted average that is designed to approximate the results of the Heavy-Duty Tran- sient Federal Test Procedure. The addition of ethanol was observed to have no noticeable effect on the emission of NOx but produced small increases in CO and HC. However, the particulate matter was observed to decrease 20% and 30% with the addition of 10% and 15% ethanol, respectively. 2001-01-2019. (SP-1632) Oxygenates: An evaluation of their effects on diesel emissions. L. I. Yeh, D. J. Rickeard, J. L. C. Duff, and J. R. Bateman, Esso Petroleum Co.; and R. H. Schlosberg, and R. F. Caers, Exxon Chemical Co. This paper summarizes a program to investigate the impact of a variety of oxygenates on diesel exhaust emissions, especially partic- ulate matter (PM) and NOx emissions. Oxygenates have been stud- ied at great length already and have been shown to be an effective method for reducing particulate emissions, although high cost remains a barrier to their widespread use. Our objectives were to assess whether some oxygenates could be more effective than others and why. Fourteen different oxygenates were studied. Testing was carried out primarily in a single-cylinder heavy-duty Caterpillar engine under high- and low-load conditions. Complementary testing was performed in three vehicles spanning a range of vehicle technolo- gies. Most of the testing used a single base fuel which served as the reference fuel although some tests were also done using a newly produced ultra-low-sulfur automotive diesel oil (ULSADO). Larger particulate matter reductions were found at high load than at low load. Surprisingly, large differences were found between oxy- genates at both high- and low-load conditions and some oxygenates were found to be much more effective than others in reducing partic- ulate matter. The most effective oxygenates on an equal oxygen con- tent basis were the C9 -C12 alcohols in both the engine and vehicle testing. Despite the large number of oxygenates studied, the large num- ber of fuel and engine variables meant multiple correlations could be found between PM levels and the variables measured. Although no simple causal explanation was found to explain all the differ- ences seen, some very strong correlations were found and these are discussed. Compositional analysis indicated little difference in particulate composition between reference fuel and oxygenated fuels in terms of dry soot and volatile organic fraction (VOF). No significant increase in NOx was seen at either high- or low-load conditions overall. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2020.

The effect of the oxygen in DMC mol- ecule has to suppress the formation of particulates was monitored by way of using thermal cracking analyzer and various conditions. 2001-01-2021. (SP-1632) Utilization of waste vegetable oil methyl ester for diesel fuel. K. Hamasaki, Kagoshima Univ.; H. Tajima, K. Takasaki, K. Satohira, and M. Enomoto, Kyushu Univ.; and H. Egawa, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. Considerable amounts (400 ~ 600 thousand tons) of waste vege- table oil in Japan are still flushed down the drain every year. Utiliza- tion of waste vegetable oil for diesel fuel leads to two advantages for environmental protection, to reduce CO2 emission from engines and to avoid water pollution of rivers. In this study, combustion characteristics of waste vegetable oil methyl ester (WME) are inves- tigated in detail by not only engine test run but also observation of burning flames in a visual engine. As results indicate, WME shows rather better combustion state in the visual engine and lower smoke emission from a high-speed DI test engine than gas oil. Moreover, by emulsifying WME with water, further improvement of combus- tion and more than 18 % reduction of NOx emission is carried out. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2022. (SP- 1629) Piston fuel film observations in an optical access GDI engine. Rolf B. Karlsson, General Motors Corp.; and John B. Heywood , Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy- A gasoline direct-injection fuel spray was observed using a fired, optical access, square cross-section single cylinder research engine and high-speed video imaging. Spray interaction with the piston is described qualitatively, and the results are compared with Computa- tional Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation results using KIVA-3V version 2. CFD simulations predicted that within the operating win- dow for stratified charge operation, between 1% and 4% of the injected fuel would remain on the piston as a liquid film, dependent primarily on piston temperature. The experimental results support the CFD simulations qualitatively, but the amount of fuel film remaining on the piston appears to be under-predicted. High-speed video footage shows a vigorous spray impingement on the piston crown, resulting in vapor production. The primary GDI combustion process, a roughly premixed flame, is followed by a turbulent diffu- sion flame or 'pool fire' in the region of the liquid film, once the piston is warm enough to produce vapor at a sufficient rate. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2023. Visualization and analysis of the impingement processes of a narrow-cone DI gasoline spray. Junesung Park , Xingbin Xie, Hoisan Kim, and Ming- Chia Lai, Wayne State Univ. The direct injection spray-wall interactions were investigated experimentally using high-speed laser-sheet imaging, shadowgra- phy, wetted footprints and phase doppler interferometry techniques. A narrow-cone high-pressure swirl injector is used to inject iso- octane fuel onto a plate, a three different impact angles inside a pres- surized chamber. Heated air and plate conditions were compared with unheated cases. Injection interval was also varied in the heated case to compare dry- and wet- wall impingement behaviors. High-speed macroscopic Mie-scattering images showed that presence of wall and air temperature has only minor effect on the bulk spray structure and penetration speed for the narrow-cone injector tested. The overall bulk motions of the spray plume and its spatial position at a given time are basically unaffected until a few millimeters before impacting the wall. The surface properties of the impact surface, such as the temperature, the presence of a preexist- ing liquid film also have a small effect on the amount of wetting or the wetted footprint; however, they have strong influence on what occurs just after impact or after a film is formed. The shadowgraph in particular shows that the plate temperature has a significant effect on vapor phase propagation. Generally, 10~20% faster, horizontal vapor phase propagation is observed along the wall at elevated tem- perature condition. For impingement onto a preexisting film, more splash and evaporation were also observed. Contrary to some pre- conceptions, there is not significant splashing and droplet rebound- ing from surfaces that are interposed in the path of the DI gasoline spray, especially for the oblique impact angle cases. There also appears to be a dense spray front consists of large sac spray droplets in the oblique impact angle cases. The bulk of the spray is not impacted on the surface, but rather is deflected by it. The microscopic details as depicted by phase doppler measure- ments show that the outcome of the droplet impaction events can be significantly influenced. Only droplets at the spray front have high enough Weber numbers for wall impact to wet, splash or rebound. Using the sign of vertical velocity, the time-resolved downward droplets and upward droplets are compared. The Weber number of upward moving droplets, which seldom exceeds unity, also decreases as the impact angle decreases, as the droplets tend to impact less and move along the wall in the deflected spray plume. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2024. Effects of fuel volatility, load, and speed on HC emissions due to piston wetting. Yiqun Huang, Ron Matthews, and Janet Ellzey, University of Texas; and Wen Dai, Ford Motor Co. Piston wetting can be isolated from the other sources of HC emissions from DISI engines by operating the engine predominantly on a gaseous fuel and using an injector probe to impact a small amount of liquid fuel on the piston top. This results in a marked increase in HC emissions. In a previous study, we used a variety of pure liquid hydrocarbon fuels to examine the influence of fuel vola- tility and structure on the HC emissions due to piston wetting. It was shown that the HC emissions correspond to the Leidenfrost effect: fuels with very low boiling points yield high HCs and those with a boiling point near or above the piston temperature produce much lower HCs. All of these prior tests of fuel effects were performed at a single operating condition: the Ford World-Wide Mapping Point (WWMP). In the present study, the effects of load and engine speed are examined. Four different normal alkanes were used, including one that appears to be near the Leidenfrost point for operation at the WWMP, one that is near the Nukiyama point, and one that appears to be in the transition region. The exhaust hydrocarbons were speci- ated to differentiate between the emissions resulting from the gas- eous fuel and those resulting from the liquid fuel. It is shown that the 'Piston Wetting Emissions Index' for engine-out THCs increases with both decreasing speed and decreasing load, and that this is primarily an effect of oxidation kinetics. Speed and load have opposite effects on unburned fuel emissions, and this appears to be a pressure effect. For all speeds and loads the Leidenfrost effect appears to be important: the most volatile fuel has the highest THC and UBF emissions whereas the two least volatile fuels have lower emissions and the fuel that is within the transition regime yields intermediate emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2025.

Robert Hennessey, Arturo Fuentes, and Ryan Wicker, University of Texas. Fuel spray imaging and PIV were used to investigate the effect of piston temperature and location on fuel spray structure and piston surface fuel impingement for three injection timings. Experiments were performed within a non-motored quartz research cylinder with in-cylinder densities and piston displacements that match those of a motored engine at the time of injection. Crank angles of 35°, 55°, and 75° before top dead center (BTDC) were considered, corre- sponding to in-cylinder pressures for the non-motored case of -5 atm, ~3 atm, and ~2 atm, respectively. A simulated piston was con- structed of aluminum with controlled surface temperatures up to 261</page><page sequence="261">2001-01-2025-2001-01-2030 210°C. The fuel spray was illuminated using single laser pulses formed into a sheet and passed through the cylinder with the images captured using a digital camera connected to an image acquisition board and computer. Instantaneous fuel spray imaging indicated that the heated piston had no significant impact on fuel spray structure when compared to the non-heated case for the single piston surface temperature investigated. Fuel spray imaging also revealed fuel impingement at both ambient and heated piston surface conditions for all experimental cases, which included surface temperatures from 100°C to 175°C. PIV results showed that the velocities of the impinging fuel clump for both the heated and ambient temperature cases were essentially the same within experimental uncertainties. 2001-01-2026. (SP- 1629) DISI fuel spray effects during simu- lated injection timing. Aaron Hutchison and Ryan Wicker, Univer- sity of Texas. The instantaneous structure of sprays from two Direct Injection, Spark Ignition (DISI) injectors were studied within a non-motored research cylinder. In-cylinder conditions simulating injection up to 27° before top dead center (BTDC) were utilized in the characteriza- tions. Comparisons between the two injectors highlight the impact of nozzle design on spray performance. Experiments include axial and horizontal flow visualization and PIV, illustrating the effect of in-cylinder density (with in-cylinder pressure used to control in- cylinder density) on instantaneous fuel spray structure. Fuel spray imaging experiments illustrate the effect of in-cylinder density on the initial clump of fluid and other spray development phases. In- cylinder density increases hollow cone narrowing and decreases spray penetration. PIV results show that the initial clump of fluid travels with extremely high velocities for all injection strategies. These results will aid in the selection of injection strategies during DISI engine design. 2001-01-2027. (SP- 1629) Piston temperature measuring tech- nology using electromagnetic induction.

(SP- 1629) Influence of fuel parameters on deposit formation and emissions in a direct injection stratified charge SI engine. Hakan Sandquist, Ingemar Denbratt, Farshid Owrang, and Jim Olsson, Chalmers University of Technology. This work investigates the influence of fuel parameters on deposit formation and emissions in a four-cylinder direct injection stratified charge (DISC) SI engine. The engine tested is a commer- cial DISC engine with a wall-guided combustion system. The com- bustion chamber deposits (CCDs) were analyzed with gas chroma- tography / mass spectrometry as well as thickness and mass mea- surements. Intake valve deposits (IVDs) were analyzed for mass, while internal injector deposits were evaluated using spray photog- raphy. The CCD build-up was obtained with the CEC F-020-A-98 per- formance test for evaluation of the influence of fuels and additives on IVDs and CCDs in port-fuel-injected SI engines. The 60 h test is designed to simulate city driving. Four fuels were compared in the study: a base gasoline, with and without a fuel additive, a specially blended high volatility gasoline, and a fuel representing the worst case of European gasolines; neither of the latter two had additives. During the first six hours of the cycle, the hydrocarbon (HC) emissions decreased for all four fuels. The explanation is most likely that the insulating effect of the deposits is beneficial for reducing HC. After the initial decrease, the HC emissions, as well as the mis- fire frequency, from the base fuel without the additive and the worst case fuel increased with time. Injector fouling was found to be responsible for the increase in HC emissions. The HC emissions from the base fuel with the additive and the high- volatility fuel with- out the additive remained at a fairly constant level after the initial decrease. Although the CCD and IVD masses were greater for the worst case fuel, there was no increase of HC emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-2029. (SP- 1629) Combustion analysis on piston cav- ity shape of a gasoline direct injection engine. Shizuo Abe, Koichi Sasaki, and Toy okazu Baika, Toyota Motor Corp.; and Tatsushi Nakashima, and Osamu Fujishiro, Nippon Soken, Inc. This paper describes the analyses to improve both stratified and homogeneous charge combustion of a gasoline direct injection engine. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and high- speed hydrocarbon (HC) measurement were employed to observe the mixture formation process. The analysis of the combustion flame propagation was conducted by in-cylinder visualization and ion current measurement. As a result of the analyses, the following conclusions were made: 1. An oval-shaped wall cavity can direct the mixture gas to the vicinity of the spark plug better than a conven- tional shell-shaped wall cavity. The-oval shaped wall cavity can improve fuel consumption and HC emission at stratified charge combustion. 2. A shallow cavity improves the homogenization of mixture gases and wide open throttle (WOT) performance. In addi- tion, the depth of the piston cavity effects the combustion speed of the homogeneous charge operation. 3. The cavity depth has an opti- mized value that balances stratified and homogeneous charge com- bustion. As a result of this study, a shallow cavity piston with an oval- shaped wall was developed. It achieved low fuel consumption, low HC emission, and high WOT performance. 2001-01-2030.

Carlisle and Robert W. Frew, Orbital Engine Co.; John R. Mills, Synerject; Allen A. Aradi, Ethyl Corp.; and Noyes L. Avery, ExxonMobil. This paper presents the findings of some fundamental character- ization of the deposits that form on the injectors of an air-assisted DISI automotive engine, including the effect of these deposits on engine performance when operated in different combustion modes, with varying fuel composition and additive content. A root cause analysis was undertaken, including an assessment of injector temperature and deposit chemistry. Fuels from a matrix designed around the European year 2000 gasoline specifications for T90, olefin and aromatic levels were used to study the effect of fuel composition on deposit formation. Two commercial gasoline deter- gent additives, of different chemistries, were used to investigate the impact on deposit formation. The results of the fuels study and deposit analysis are consistent with published theories concerning fuel composition impact on combustion chamber deposit (CCD). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 262</page><page sequence="262">200 1 -0 1 -2040-200 1 -0 1 -2064 2001-01-2040. Development of low distortion cylinder liners using rapidly solidified aluminum alloy with high silicon con- tent. Shuhei Adachi and Jun-ichi Inami, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd.; and Jun Kusui, Toyo Aluminum K. K. A cylinder liner made of a new rapidly solidified powder-based aluminum alloy has been developed for high-speed motorcycle engines, which have aluminum cylinder liners inserted in a high- pressure-die-cast cylinder block. The new cylinder liner material has a thermal expansion coefficient 20% lower than that of the block material. With this structure, the cylinder liner could be tightly fas- tened in the cylinder block so that a high machining accuracy of the cylinder bore could be achieved. The structure also enables one to minimize the cylinder bore distortion and the local heating during engine running due to the uniform distribution of the thermal con- ductivity. For the cylinder liner material, a chemical composition of 22-26% Si, 0.1-0.3% Cu, 0.05-0.9% Mg, Al bal. (mass %) was chosen. The limited Cu content was due to its good extruding char- acteristics. The molten alloy was atomized, followed by the cold iso- static pressing (CIP) and vacuum-sintering. The consolidated billet was hot-extruded into a tube form and heat-treated in the T6 condi- tion. The cast alloy as the cylinder block was JIS ADC 10 containing 10 mass % Si. The bore was then machined and plated with a SiC particle-dispersed Ni-P galvanic layer. The physical and mechanical properties of the new cylinder liner material were compared with conventional cylinder liner materials and the effect of chemical composition and microstructure on cylin- der liner characteristics was discussed based on the experimental data. This type of cylinder liner has been successfully used for series production models in the European market to realize a drastic improvement in performance and oil consumption. 2001-01-2041. Small engines evolution: The road ahead. M. Nuti, . What shall be the future of Small Internal Combustion Engines? Much rumor has been made in these last times about the substitution of I.C. engine with a very clean solution: the fuel cell and electric motor with basically zero emissions, and some practical applications primarily on vehicles appear feasible, can this be extended to small engines? We can say yes in principle, but at present stage of development following the current lead time to 'productionized' solutions, a period of at least ten years is envisaged. To clarify this statement a fuel cell application to a bicycle has been carried out, but note that for a pedal-assisted-only capability (300 W) a weight of 65 kg is added. I believe so that the S.I. engine is 'Die Hard'like in the homony- mous movie and I am fully convinced that sound solutions will be developed using the parallel development of other technologies such as 'Mechatronics'; remember as example the dramatic transforma- tion of heavy, low-speed and dirty diesel engine with the help of electronics. There is in this vision a real potential for Small Engines to be converted in fully sustainable units in a better environment and let me conclude with a motto written on the stern of a famous clipper 'Where's a Will a Way.' 2001-01-2042. A technological approach to addressing envi- ronment and energy issues. Akira Takano, Honda of the UK Man- ufacturing Ltd. The report on technologies and strategies in the automotive industry was made by the SAE of Japan based upon forecasting the social demands and the likely innovations in technology in the early twenty-first century. In the report, it states that global environment protection and efficient energy usage, improved car traffic safety, and the development of an advanced information communication society are a necessity. The first two issues are especially important for products equipped with small engines. Honda's technological approach will be discussed with reference to actual examples. 2001-01-2060. Update on engine combustion research at San- dia National Laboratories. Jay Keller and Gurpreet Singh, Sandia National Labs. The objectives of this paper are to describe the research efforts in diesel engine combustion at Sandia National Laboratories' Com- bustion Research Facility and to provide recent experimental results. We have four diesel engine experiments supported by the Depart- ment of Energy, Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies: a one- cylinder version of a Cummins heavy-duty engine, a diesel simula- tion facility, a one-cylinder Caterpillar engine to evaluate combus- tion of alternative fuels, and a homogeneous-charge, compression- ignition (HCCI) engine. Recent experimental results of diesel com- bustion research will be discussed and a description will be given of our HCCI experimental program and of our HCCI modeling work. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2061. Heavy vehicle propulsion materials: recent progress and future plans. D. Ray Johnson, Oak Ridge National Lab.; and Sidney Diamond, U.S. Department of Energy. The Heavy Vehicle Propulsion Materials Program provides enabling materials technology for the U.S. DOE Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT). The technical agenda for the pro- gram is based on an industry assessment and the technology road- map for the OHVT. A five-year program plan was published in 2000. Major efforts in the program are materials for diesel engine fuel systems, exhaust aftertreatment, and air handling. Additional efforts include diesel engine valve-train materials, structural compo- nents, and thermal management. Advanced materials, including high-temperature metal alloys, intermetallics, cermets, ceramics, amorphous materials, metal-and ceramic-matrix composites, and coatings, are investigated for critical engine applications. Selected technical issues and planned and ongoing projects as well as brief summaries of several technical highlights are given. 2001-01-2062. The Detroit Diesel DELTA engine - Recent technological achievements. Nabil S. Hakim and Brian Bolton, Detroit Diesel Corp. The Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) DELTA engine has been specifically designed for the North American market. The advanced engine technologies being pursued for this engine enables its appli- cations to the light truck/SUV vehicles for personal transportation as well as for the light commercial use, such as urban delivery vans. This paper reports on the progress attained so far in engine devel- opment. The next stage is currently under way resulting in Genera- tion 1.0 DELTA engine technology. The results of various technol- ogy assessments on Generation 0.X hardware are reported. Further, the Generation 1 .0 design and its potential will be briefly presented. It is concluded that the DELTA engine technology, including break- through advancements, is viable for practical applications to meet future light-duty and heavy-duty emissions with potentially attrac- tive commercial features. 2001-01-2064. Exhaust aftertreatment research for heavy vehicles. Ronald L. Graves, Michael D. Kass, Samuel A. Lewis, Wil- liam P. Partridge, and John F. Thomas, Oak Ridge National Lab.; C. F. Habeger, C. L. Aardahl, K. G. Rappe, D. N. Tran, and M. A. Delgado, Pacific Northwest National Lab.; and Gurpreet Singh, U.S. Department of Energy. The Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies supports research to enable high-efficiency diesel engines to meet future emissions regu- lations, thus clearing the way for their use in light trucks as well as continuing as the most efficient powerplant for freight-haulers. Compliance with Tier 2 emission regulations for light-duty vehicles will require effective exhaust emission controls (aftertreatment) for diesels in these applications. Diesel-powered heavy trucks face a similar situation for the 2007 regulations announced by EPA in December 2000. DOE laboratories are working with industry to improve emission control technologies in projects ranging from application of new diagnostics for elucidating key mechanisms, to 263</page><page sequence="263">2001-01-2064-2001-01-2073 development and evaluation of prototype devices.

Koeberlein , and Michael J. Ruth , Cummins Inc. Cummins has studied requirements of the Light Truck Automo- tive market in the United States and believes that the proposed V-family of engines meets those needs. Design and development of the V-family engine system continues and has expanded. The engine system is a difficult one, since the combined requirements of a very fuel-efficient commercial diesel, and the performance and sociabil- ity requirements of a gasoline engine are needed. Results of testing show that the engine can meet requirements for fuel economy and emissions in the Tier 2 interim period from 2004 to 2008. Advanced results show that the full Tier 2 results for 2008 and beyond can be achieved on a laboratory basis. 2001-01-2067. Natural gas as a future fuel for heavy-duty vehicles. Wai-Lin Litzke and James Węgrzyn , Brookhaven National Lab. In addition to their significant environmental impacts, medium- duty and heavy-duty (HD) vehicles are high volume fuel users. Development of such vehicles, which include transit buses, refuse trucks, and HD Class 6-8 trucks, that are fueled with natural gas is strategic to market introduction of natural gas vehicles (NGV). Over the past five years the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) has funded technological developments in NGV systems to support the growth of this sector in the highly competitive transportation market. The goals are to minimize emissions associated with NGV use, to improve on the economies of scale, and to continue supporting the testing and safety assessments of all new systems. This paper provides an overview of the status of major projects under a program supported by DOE/ OHVT and managed by Brookhaven National Laboratory. The dis- cussion focuses on the program's technical strategy in meeting spe- cific goals proposed by the NGV industry and the government. Rel- evant projects include the development of low-cost fuel storage, fueling infrastructure, and HD vehicle applications. 2001-01-2068. The DOE/NREL next generation natural gas vehicle program - An overview. Kevin Walkowicz , National Renewable Energy Lab.; Denny Stephens , Battelle Memorial Insti- tute; and Kevin Stork , U.S. Department of Energy. This paper summarizes the Next Generation Natural Gas Vehicle (NG-NGV) Program that is led by the U.S. Department Of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The goal of this program is to develop and implement one Class 3-6 compressed natural gas (CNG) prototype vehicle and one Class 7-8 liquefied natural gas (LNG) prototype vehicle in the 2004 to 2007 timeframe. OHVT intends for these vehicles to have 0.5 g/bhp-hr or lower emis- sions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) by 2004 and 0.2 g/bhp-hr or lower NOx by 2007. These vehicles will also have particulate matter (PM) emissions of 0.01 g/bhp-hr or lower by 2004. In addition to ambi- tious emissions goals, these vehicles will target life-cycle economics that are compatible with their conventionally fueled counterparts. 2001-01-2069. The DOE/NREL environmental science pro- gram. Douglas R. Law son. National Renewable Energy Lab.; and Michael Gurevich, U.S. Department of Energy. This paper summarizes the several of the studies in the Environ- mental Science Program being sponsored by DOE's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT) through the National Renew- able Energy Laboratory (NREL). The goal of the Environmental Science Program is to understand atmospheric impacts and potential health effects that may be caused by the use of petroleum-based fuels and alternative transportation fuels from mobile sources. The Program is regulatory-driven, and focuses on ozone, airborne parti- cles, visibility and regional haze, air toxics, and health effects of air pollutants. Each project in the Program is designed to address poli- cy-relevant objectives. Current projects in the Environmental Sci- ence Program have four areas of focus: improving technology for emissions measurements; vehicle emissions measurements; emis- sion inventory development/improvement; ambient impacts, includ- ing health effects. 2001-01-2071. A preliminary study of energy recovery in vehicles by using regenerative magnetic shock absorbers. R. B. Goldner and P. Zerigian, Tufts Univ.; and J. R. Hull, Ar gonne National Lab. Road vehicles can expend a significant amount of energy in undesirable vertical motions that are induced by road bumps, and much of that is dissipated in conventional shock absorbers as they dampen the vertical motions. Presented in this paper are some of the results of a study aimed at determining the effectiveness of efficiently transforming that energy into electrical power by using optimally designed regenera- tive electromagnetic shock absorbers. In turn, the electrical power can be used to recharge batteries or other efficient energy storage devices (e.g., flywheels) rather than be dissipated. The results of the study are encouraging - they suggest that a significant amount of the vertical motion energy can be recovered and stored. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2072. Advanced aerodynamic devices to improve the performance, economics, handling and safety of heavy vehicles. Robert J. Englar, Georgia Tech Research Institute Aerospace. Research is being conducted at the Georgia Tech Research Insti- tute (GTRI) to develop advanced aerodynamic devices to improve the performance, economics, stability, handling and safety of opera- tion of Heavy Vehicles by using previously-developed and flight- tested pneumatic (blown) aircraft technology. Recent wind-tunnel investigations of a generic Heavy Vehicle model with blowing slots on both the leading and trailing edges of the trailer have been con- ducted under contract to the DOE Office of Heavy Vehicle Technol- ogies. These experimental results show overall aerodynamic drag reductions on the Pneumatic Heavy Vehicle of 50% using only 1 psig blowing pressure in the plenums, and over 80% drag reductions if additional blowing air were available. Additionally, an increase in drag force for braking was confirmed by blowing different slots. Lift coefficient was increased for rolling resistance reduction by blowing only the top slot, while downforce was produced for trac- tion increase by blowing only the bottom. Also, side force and yaw- ing moment were generated on either side of the vehicle, and direc- tional stability was restored by blowing the appropriate side slot. These experimental results and the predicted full-scale payoffs are presented in this paper, as is a discussion of additional applications to conventional commercial autos, buses, motor homes, and Sport Utility Vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2073. Ultralight stainless steel urban bus concept. J. Bruce Emmons and Leonard J. Blessing, Autokinetics Inc. While stainless steel buses are certainly not new, this study reveals opportunities for substantial improvements in structural per- formance. The objective of this project was to investigate the mass saving potential of ultra-high strength stainless steel as applied to the structure of a full size urban transit bus. The resulting design for a low floor, hybrid bus has an empty weight less than half that of a conventional transit bus. The reduced curb weight allows for a greater pay load, without exceeding legal axle limits. A combination of finite element modeling and dynamic testing of scale models was used to predict structural performance. 264</page><page sequence="264">2001-01-2077-2001-01-2090 2001-01-2077. HCCI combustion: analysis and experiments. Salvador M. Aceves, Daniel L. Flowers , Joel Martinez-Frias, and J. Ray Smith , Lawrence Livermore National Lab.; and Robert Dib- ble, Michael Au, and James Girard, University of California. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) is a new combustion technology that may develop as an alternative to diesel engines with high efficiency and low NOx and particulate matter emissions. This paper describes the HCCI research activities being currently pursued at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and at the University of California Berkeley. Current activities include analysis as well as experimental work. On analysis, we have developed two powerful tools: a single zone model and a multi-zone model. The single zone model has proven very successful in predicting start of combustion and provid- ing reasonable estimates for peak cylinder pressure, indicated effi- ciency and NOX emissions. This model is being applied to develop detailed engine performance maps and control strategies, and to ana- lyze the problem of engine startability. The multi-zone model is capable of very accurate predictions of the combustion process, including HC and CO emissions. The multi-zone model has applica- bility to the optimization of combustion chamber geometry and operating conditions to achieve controlled combustion at high effi- ciency and low emissions. On experimental work, we have done a thorough evaluation of operating conditions in a 4-cy linder Volkswagen TDI engine. The engine has been operated over a wide range of conditions by adjust- ing the intake temperature and the fuel flow rate. Satisfactory opera- tion has been obtained over a wide range of operating conditions. Cylinder-to-cylinder variations play an important role in limiting maximum power, and should be controlled to achieve satisfactory performance. 2001-01-2085. The dortmunder - biomechanical model for quantification and assessment of the load on the lumbar spine. Matthias Jäger, Alwin Luttmann, Rainer Göllner, and Wolfgang Laurig, Institut für Arbeitsphysiologie an der Universität. Evaluation of occupational activities with regard to potential overexertion of the lumbar spine requires the quantification and assessment of lumbar load. The aim of this paper is to introduce a biomechanical model, called The Dortmunder. The current version represents a 3-D dynamic simulation tool, which permits calculation of several mechanical measures of lumbar load in the form of local and temporal profiles. For the assessment of overexertion risk, task- related lumbar-load values can be compared to the so-called Dort- mund Recommendations, which represent age-and-gender-related limits based on the load-bearing capacity of spinal elements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2086. Human modeling - from bubblemen to skele- tons. Shawn P. McGuan, Mechanical Dynamics Inc. This paper introduces a novel human modeling system utilizing the ADAMS (Mechanical Dynamics Inc.) multi-body simulation program. The FIGURE Human Modeling system is a plug-in to ADAMS which provides users with the capability to generate human models of various levels of detail and fidelity, permitting simulations ranging from passive response (crash, falls, etc.) to active participation (sports performance, task simulation). One of the major innovations of FIGURE is how human motion is simulated using a concept of 'motion agents'. Motion agents are parts, which are positioned on the body segments at the location of the motion target marker from the motion, capture system. The motion agent is attached to the body part with a 6 degree-of- freedom spring so as to be a 'motion influencer' rather than a 'motion gover- nor'. Data from the motion capture system drives the agents thereby driving the human model. Since the human model is physics-based, the model will not violate joint restrictions, environment contacts, etc. From this simulation, resulting muscle elongation histories are then captured. A second simulation is performed using these muscle elongation histories via proportional derivative (PD) controllers to drive the human model using a direct dynamics approach. The paper introduces the modeling paradigm of FIGURE and provides an example of direct dynamics simulation based on data from a newly introduced motion capture device. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2087. Development of an electronic belt fit test device (eBTD) for digitally certifying seat belt fit compliance. Casey J. Pruett and Jochen Balzulat, Tecmath of North America, Inc.; and Christina M. Brown, Transport Canada. Vehicle seat belt efficacy relates directly to the extent that occu- pant anthropometric dimensions align with the seat belt geometric design. Transport Canada researched and developed a Belt Fit Test Device (BTD) to assess potential occupant injuries resulting from incongruities between seat belt design and occupant anatomical characteristics. A proposed electronic version (eBTD) will allow vehicle manufacturers to use digital human modeling programs and computer-aided design (CAD) data and tools to evaluate seat belt designs before a vehicle is produced. This software module simu- lates seat belt routing over CAD data representing the physical device. The simulation incorporates anchor point kinematics and measures the belt position over clavicle, sternum and lap scales. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2088. Verification and validation of roof bolter sim- ulation models for studying events between a machine and its operator. John R. Bartels, Dean H. Ambrose, and Richard C. Wang, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). This paper presents the results of a study to verify and validate a computer model that represents and analyzes motions and hazard- ous events in a simulated three-dimensional workplace. The purpose of the computer model is to support research that is investigating the safe speed range for the vertical movement of roof bolter boom arms to reduce worker injuries in underground coal mines. The informa- tion obtained for this paper is based upon a project that is investigat- ing means to reduce workers risks of injury from exposure to mining machinery. The methodology being employed by the project includes human factors design considerations, anthropometric mod- eling and simulation tools, laboratory validation, engineering inter- ventions, and collaboration with industry and an equipment manu- facturer. The results of this study were used to (1) determine the input parameters that are unique to the mining environment and needed to develop a credible, computer-based, human-machine interactive model, (2) develop test methods to measure the required parameters, and (3) to refine the human-machine interactive com- puter model. 2001-01-2090. Biomechanical realism versus algorithmic effi- ciency: a trade-off in human motion simulation modeling. Xudong Zhang, University of Illinois. The purpose this paper is to delineate why there exists a trade-off between biomechanical realism and algorithmic efficiency for human motion simulation models, and to illustrate how empirical human movement data and findings can be integrated with novel modeling techniques to overcome such a realism-efficiency trade- off. We first review three major classes of biomechanical models for human motion simulation. The review of these models is woven together by a common fundamental problem of redundancy- kinematic and/or muscle redundancy. We describe how this problem is resolved in each class of models, and unveil how the trade-off arises, that is, how the computational demand associated with solv- ing the problem is amplified as a model evolves from small scale to large scale, or from less realism to more realism. Several exam- ples are then presented to illustrate how empirical motion data can be utilized for variable reduction and control simplification that help overcome the realism-efficiency trade-off. Examples are given for various levels of movement modeling, including joint motion acti- 265</page><page sequence="265">2001-01-2090-2001-01-2097 vation information for minimizing the necessary degrees of free- dom, joint motion coordination information for reducing kinematic model variables, and parameterization of inverse dynamics solutions for simplifying forward dynamics simulations. We conclude by remarking on future directions for the development of realistic, computationally efficient human motion simulation models. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2091. Influence of automotive seat and package fac- tors on posture and applicability to design models. Phaedra Gutowski, Tamara Reid Bush, and Robert Hubbard, Michigan State Univ.; and Jochen Balzulat, Tecmath AG. In an effort to create computer models to promote rapid, cost- effective prototyping while easing design changes, more informa- tion about how people interact with seats is needed. Predicting the occupant location, their geometry, and motion within a vehicle leads to a better determination of safety restraint location, controls reach, and visibility - factors that affect the overall operation of the vehicle. Based on the Michigan State University JOHN model, which provides a biomechanical simulation of the torso posture, experi- ments were conducted to examine the change of postures due to seat and interior package factors. The results can be incorporated into the posture prediction model of the RAMSIS program to give a more detailed prognosis of the spine curvature and refine the model-seat interactions. This paper will address findings of the experimental study with relation to model development. 2001-01-2092. Prediction of head orientation based on the visual image of a three dimensional space. Kyunghan Kim and Bernard J. Martin, University of Michigan. Head movements contribute to the acquisition of targets in visu- ally guided tasks such as reaching and grasping. It has been found that head orientation is generally related to the spatial location of the visual target. The movements of the head in a three-dimensional space are described using six degrees of freedom including transla- tions along X-, y- and z-axis plus rotations about x-, y- and z-axis. While the control of head movement is heavily dependent upon visual perception, head movements lead to a change in the visual perception of the task space as well. In the present study we ana- lyzed head movements in a set of driving simulation experiments. Also a theoretical reconstruction of the perceived task space after head movements was modeled by a statistical regression. This pro- cess included the transformation of the task space from a global ref- erence frame (earth-fixed) into a perceived space in a head-centered reference frame (head-fixed). Derived transformation parameters were decomposed into translational / rotational components of the head movements and compared to actual head rotation / translation to confirm the effectiveness of the model. 2001-01-2093. Postural behaviour in static gazing sidewards. Nico J. Delleman, Maaike A. Huysmans, and Lottie F.M. Kuijt- Evers, TNO Human Factors. This paper describes postural behaviour in static gazing side- wards. The results show that the head (supported by underlying seg- ments) contributes at a particular rate to get the gaze onto target. This rate is reduced in the case that postural constraints are present, i.e., restricted ranges of motion of the pelvis (in sitting) and the chest (due to fixed hand positions), suggesting that postural behaviour is guided by some sort of musculoskeletal load sharing. 2001-01-2094. Modeling variability in reaching motions. Julian J. Faraway and Jennifer Hu, University of Michigan. Motion prediction models may give the average reach for an individual of specified characteristics. The actual reach will vary from this reach in a manner that may depend on both systematic and random factors. We describe a modeling approach that incorporates the variability within the reaches of a given subject and that between subject-s. This information is useful to designers in investigating phenomena that may not occur during the average reach but may occur during variants such as collision with an obstacle or injury due to over-exertion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2095. Towards understanding the workspace of the upper extremities. Karim Abdel-Malek, Jingzhou Yang, and Rich- ard Brand, University of Iowa; and Emad Tanbour, Hon Technol- ogy Inc. Significant attention in recent years has been given towards obtaining a better understanding of human joint ranges, measure- ment, and functionality, especially in conjunction with commands issued by the central nervous system. Studies of those commands often include computer algorithms to describe path trajectories. These are typically in 'open-form' with specific descriptions of motions, but not 'closed form' mathematical solutions of the full range of possibilities. This paper proposes a rigorous 'closed form' kinematic formulation to model human limbs, understand their workspace (also called the reach envelope), and delineate barriers therein where a path becomes difficult or impossible owing to physi- cal constraints. The novel ability to visualize barriers in the work- space emphasizes the power of these closed form equations. More- over, this formulation takes into account joint limits in terms of ranges of motion and identifies barriers therein where a person is required to attain a different posture. Examples include the work- spaces of a typical forearm, a typical finger, and is used to illustrate the visualization of the progress in the functionality of a wrist under- going rehabilitation. 2001 SAE Transections Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2096. Relationship between KANSEI words describ- ing the human body and body dimensions for modeling syn- thetic actors. Masaaki Mochimaru and Makiko Kouchi, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and. In order to design a digital human model for computer graphics based on natural language, a mathematical model which estimates the scores of KANSEI words (overweight, thin, muscular etc.) from body dimensions was developed. Evaluation observers, consisting of 49 females and 64 males, watched image photographs of 24 young women and replied semantic scores of 21 KANSEI words for each photographed subject. The 24 photographed subjects were selected from over 200 subjects based on the somatotype. Analyzing the relationship between the scores and the 35 body dimensions of the photographed subjects, it was found that the sex differences of the observers were significant. Female observers evaluated body forms in greater detail and selected the dimensions to evaluate the scores of KANSEI words more carefully. Thus, we have developed a mathematical model, which estimates the scores of KANSEI words from body dimensions for the typical female observer. Since the scores of the 21 KANSEI words were correlated with each other, an independent set of 8 KANSEI words were selected. The mathe- matical model was constructed for 3 KANSEI words (overweight, plump and thin) in a multivariate regression model, and a fuzzy rea- soning model for the 5 other words (skinny, medium, muscular, sturdy and tight). The errors of the estimated scores of KANSEI words were validated by another 38 female observers. The errors were 5% through 20%, and it was smaller than the standard devia- tion of inter-observer errors. 2001-01-2097.

The paper is dedicated to adequacy analysis of Simulation Model of Human Body Thermoregulation System (HTSSM), intended for design of air/space Autonomous Life Support System (ALSS).

Active heat exchange mechanisms of thermoregulation system are described on the basis of fuzzy set theory. This paper discusses the HTMSS and its applications for: The analysis of a human heat state under heat stress conditions for a helmet area ventilation system design. The analysis of the temperature/moisture fields in the extra- vehicular suit for design of thermal control system. The results of computed experiments obtained using the HTMSS are also reviewed. 2001-01-2098. Exertion-driven strength modeling of the shoulder. Clark R. Dickerson and Don B. Chafftn, University of Michigan. This study begins the exploration of the relationship between shoulder external moments and perceived exertion levels for sub- maximal delivery tasks. Twenty subjects were recorded while per- forming hand load movement tasks to specified targets. After each exertion, subjects were asked to rate the effort required to perform the task. The recorded motion profiles were processed using a biomechanical upper extremity model, from which resultant exter- nal shoulder moments were calculated. Average resultant shoulder moments, stratified by exertion level, were also calculated. Several individual subject moment/exertion profiles showed identifiable trends. It was demonstrated that while no strong relationships exist for individual task exertion effort prediction based on resultant shoulder moments, there is a general trend in the overall data sam- ple, as is shown by a high correlation between mean integrated resultant shoulder moment by exertion level and exertion levels. 2001-01-2099. Predicting fatigue for isolated joints while wearing an extra-vehicular mobility unit (EMU). James C. Maida , NASA Johnson Space Center ; L. Javier Gonzalez , Johnson Engineering; Sudhakar Rajulu , NASA Space Biomedical Institute; and Erica Miles , Lockheed Martin. To work outside a space craft, humans must wear a protective suit. The required suit pressurization creates additional resistance for the wearer while performing work. How much does the suit effect work and fatigue? To answer these questions, dynamic torque was collected for the shoulder, elbow and wrist for six subjects in an Extra- vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). In order to quantify fatigue, the subjects were to exert maximum voluntary torque for five minutes or until their maximum fell below 50% of their initial maximum for three consecutive repetitions. Using the collected torque and time data, logarithmic based functions were derived to estimate torque decay to within an absolute error of 20%. These results will be used in the development of a generalized tool for pre- diction of maximum available torque over time for humans using the current EMU. 2001-01-2100. Human performance modeling: representa- tion of different steering styles. L.M.T. Whittaker and A.F. Spil- lane, Land Rover; and R.P. Jones, University of Warwick. A driver model has been created in order to aid the development of new technologies that have the potential to enhance vehicle han- dling. This paper describes an investigation into the representation of different steering styles for human performance modeling. Differ- ent steering styles result in individual drivers using different steering inputs when negotiating an identical manoeuvre. The work is moti- vated by the effect of different steering styles on drivers' assess- ments of vehicles and the consequent possibility of engineering future vehicles to optimise the driver/vehicle combination. To achieve this optimisation, a driver model that is able to digitally rep- resent different steering styles is required. Optimal control theory is used to formulate such a driver model; a cost functional represents the driver's motivation. It is demonstrated that assigning different relative costs to driver effort and vehicle motion results in the driver model using different steering inputs to negotiate a course. Vehicle test results show that different drivers experience different vehicle motion during the same manoeuvre; this is also apparent in results from the driver model. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2101. Prerequisites for extensive computer manikin analysis - An example with hierarchical task analysis, file exchange protocol and a relational database. Anders Sundin, Marianne Törner, Magnus Rönnäng, and Tania Dukic, Chalmers University of Technology; Constanze Wartenberg, National Insti- tute for Working Life - West ; Hans Sjöberg and Roland Örtengren, Chalmers University of Technology ; and Joakim Frid, Permanova AB. In this case study, a human factors engineering (HFE) analysis was carried out in the preliminary design phase of the Cupola. Cupola is a European Space Agency (ESA) module for manned space flights for the International Space Station (ISS) as part of a Barter Arrangement between ESA and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Manikin software was used early in the design process before the production of any flight hardware. The manikin analysis was supported by the use of hierarchical task analysis, a file exchange protocol and a relational database. This paper describes methodological aspects of the use of the supporting methods. Results show that hierarchical task analy- sis, a file exchange protocol and a relational database are prerequi- sites for successful extensive manikin analysis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2102.

Fur- thermore, we discuss how the composite of these two types of mod- els could be useful in evaluating team aspects such as cognitive decisions, collaboration and workload. We discuss how the compos- ite model promotes visualization of human factors design concepts. For example, capturing timing and error information from a human figure model would greatly enhance the validity of the composite model. Likewise, using human process models to represent the aspects of the process that do not require a human figure model allows larger, more complex processes to be modeled 2001-01-2103. Standardizing human model queries. John D. Ianni, Wright-Patterson AFB. One of the goals of the Society of Automotive Engineers Human Modeling Subcommittee has been to link models of human pro- cesses with anthropometric (human body) models. This requires conveying actions such as climb, lift or operate, and it requires a method to convey the state of the virtual world. This paper describes a possible standard protocol to query figure models for information such as the human's posture, clothing worn or an object's location. This protocol was derived from user requirements and specifications of several commercial figure models. This paper is intended to pro- vide a starting point for further discussions about such a standard 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2104. Analysis of anthropometry and range validity of the digital human model RAMSIS. Thomas Alexander and Jes- sica Conradi, Research Institute for Communication, Information Processing. Nowadays digital human models (DHM) have become a practi- cal tool for design of human-machine interfaces and work environ- ments. With growing importance of computer-aided design, elec- tronic mock-ups, and rapid prototyping in the production cycle the use of DHMs will increase. The high resolution of CAD-systems and the (photo-) realistic appearance of digital human models might easily evoke the idea of high accuracy and validity of the results. Moreover, it could lead to a non-critical use of these models. On the other hand information 267</page><page sequence="267">2001-01-2104-2001-01-21 12 about correctness, accuracy, and validity of the model itself and its results are often not taken into consideration. But even if considered it is often forgotten that the information given is not universally valid and only suitable for special applications. The Research Institute for Communication, Information Process- ing and Ergonomics (FKIE) of the Research Establishment for Applied Sciences (FGAN) carries out studies in the area of applica- bility and validity of human models. In this paper the results of a validation study for the digital human model RAMSIS are described. This model has been developed for car interior design and several studies in this area. In this study the use for the design of a console workplace for radar and weapon systems operators is ana- lyzed which is a different application. With this approach it is exam- ined whether the results from different validation studies match or differ from each other. The study is divided into two parts: the first part is the validity of anthropometric modeling; the second refers to the posture model of RAMSIS. The results of the study show that on the one hand anthropometric modeling of individuals and posture modeling at reaching for nearby targets yields small inaccuracies, on the other hand posture modeling at reaching for targets close to maximum range yields larger errors. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2105. Influence of pose on 3-D shape classification: part II. Eric Paquet and Marc Rioux, National Research Council. Last year we presented the influence of pose on three- dimensional (3-D) shape classification in the context of a repeata- bility study. Meaning, that the subjects are repeatedly scanned 10 times and they attempt to assume the same pose each time. It was shown that changes due to a slight pose modification had no detri- mental effects for shape classification. This paper discuss a second set of experiments, designed to test the stability of the geometric search engine in more extreme cases. The pose of the subjects between the scans are modified substantially, with an increasing amount of differences compared to the CAESAR protocol. Experi- mental results will be presented and discussed. 2001-01-2106. Digital definition of the deflected shape of the human body in seated postures for ergonomie design in CAD models. Raymond R. Brodeur and Herbert M. Reynolds , ERL, LLC. An advanced biofidelic shape of the human body is needed in computer-aided design (CAD) models for ergonomie design. To be used in seat and automotive design, this advance in biofidelity must be a 3D CAD tool that includes the deflected shape of the human body and must include skeletal landmarks, especially those related to load paths. The CAD tools must represent the range of the popula- tion and must also represent the full range of seated postures. To develop our CAD models, a 3D anthropometric study was undertaken that used skeletal landmarks to define relative positions of transverse cross-sections that describe both the 'visible' and 'invisible' shape of the seated body. Data were collected on large males, average males and small females. Subjects were measured in several postures while sitting on flat foam pads. Transverse sec- tions were measured at the center of gravity of each thigh, under the ischial tuberosities and at the S2, L4, T8 and T4 spinal levels. A coordinate measurement machine (CMM) was used in conjunction with a strain strip to measure the shape of each section. The resulting transverse sections define the deflected shape (patent pending) of the seated body for three body sizes. The transverse section data were combined with 2D center line sections (patent pending) developed previously. Skeletal landmarks were used to define frames of reference to combine the transverse sections with the center line sections of the human body. The shape between regions was interpolated with C2 continuity using the trans- verse sections and center line curves as controls. The resulting mod- els of the body define the 3D biofidelic seated shape that is required to estimate the design of the optimal seat and seating package for the human occupant-driver. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2107. Some notes on the issue of anthropometrical accuracy in digital human modeling manikins. Pyter N. Hoek- stra, Delfi University of Technology. This paper addresses some aspects of the issue of anthropometri- cal accuracy in digital human modeling manikins as expressed in a proposed European draft prEN ISO 15536. Some problems and pos- sible solutions are illustrated by comparing two computer manikin systems available in our School of Industrial Design Engineering. 2001-01-2109. An evaluation of vehicle steering arrangement with dexterity measures of virtual human. Masatoshi Hada, Yasushi Amano, Katsuhiko Fukui, and Shun-ichi Doi, TOYOTA Central Research and Development Labs., INC. Four ellipsoid-type dexterity analyses, which have been popular in the field of robotics, were applied to evaluate vehicle driver's steering arrangement. The Human was modeled as three- dimensional rigid bodies. Their length and inertia properties were based on anthropometric data. The newly defined measures were introduced as an effective radius of each ellipsoid along the steering direction, divided by a degree of agreement between the principal axes of the ellipsoid and those of the steering wheel. Sensitivity analyses were done with regard to the steering wheel location in a vertical plane and inclination, and seat back angle. Measures from dynamic dexterity ellipsoids, in particular the measure based on kinetic energy, nearly correspond to the traditional region of steer- ing wheel arrangement from subjective judgement. Optimum incli- nation angle depending on seat back angle was calculated for three different sizes of drivers with the measures from dynamic dexterity ellipsoids. 2001-01-2110. Realistic posture prediction for maximum dex- terity. Karim Abdel-Malek and Wei Yu, University of Iowa; Moha- mad Jaber, Ryerson Polytechnic Univ.; and Jerry Duncan, John Deere Technical Center. This paper presents an efficient numerical formulation for the prediction of realistic postures. This problem is defined by the method (or procedure) used to predict the posture of a human, given a point in the reachable space. The exposition addresses (1) the determination whether a point is reachable (i.e., does is it exist within the reach envelope) and (2) the calculation of a posture for a given point. While many researchers have used either statistical models of empirical data or the traditional geometric inverse kine- matics method for posture prediction, we present a method based on kinematics for modeling, but one that uses optimization of a cost function to predict a realistic posture. It is shown that this method replicates the human mind in selecting a posture from an infinite number of possible postures. We illustrate the methodology and an accompanying experimental code through a planar and a spatial example, and validation using commercial human modeling and simulation code. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2112. Modifying motions for avoiding obstacles. Woojin Park, Don B. Chaffin, and Bernard J. Martin, University of Michigan. Interference between physical objects in the workspace and the moving human body may cause serious problems, including errors in manual operation, physical damage and trauma from the collision, and increased biomechanical stresses due to movement reorganiza- tion for avoiding the obstacles. Therefore, a computer algorithm to detect possible collisions and simulate human motions to avoid obstacles will be an important tool for computer-aided ergonomics and optimization of system design in the early stage of a design pro- cess. In the present study, we present a method of modifying motions for obstacle avoidance when the object intrudes near the center of the planned motion. We take the motion modification approach, as we believe that for a certain class of obstacle avoidance problems, a person would modify a pre-planned motion that would result in a collision to a new one that is collision-free, as opposed to organizing a totally unique motion pattern. Our method assumes 268</page><page sequence="268">2001-01-21 12-2001-01-2120 that there is an existing motion sample that satisfies the initial and final hand position constraints. This existing motion sample is called a root motion. If the root motion is found to incur a collision with obstacles, it will be modified to become collision-free. The modifi- cation is not done at random, but guided utilizing a 'via' posture (Rosenbaum et al., 1999). This idea is based upon the hypothesis that the human brain can reorganize a pre-planned motion to avoid obstacles by locating a 'via' posture at a certain time of the motion and altering the pre-planned angular motion trajectories to pass through the 'via' posture. An optimization model is presented for finding a via posture via which the resulting modified motion becomes a realistic variation of the root motion as well as collision- free. Our initial simulation results indicate that the proposed method is promising for planning and simulating obstacle avoidance motions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2113. Human-model based movement-capturing without markers for ergonomie studies. Thomas Seitz and Heiner Bubb, Lehrstuhl jur Ergonomie an der Technischen Universität. This paper presents a movement measurement system to acquire human motion data without markers. The system uses an accurate human man model as template to measure, based on image process- ing, movements. This method enables quick ergonomie measure- ments because no preparation of a subject with markers or special clothes is needed. All results which are achieved with this system are conform to the used man model and can be directly used for human modeling. Exemplary three investigations are presented con- cerning in-vehicle head and arm movements and riding a bike. 2001-01-2114. Ergonomie evaluation and visualization in the car design process. Lars Hanson , Lund Univ. Industries strive to minimize their development costs, to shorten the time required for development and to increase the quality of the product. The paper summarizes three ergonomie evaluation methods developed for the automotive industry. The first method presents a manikin with a movement pattern similar to people. The second method is a tool to evaluate comfort that can be combined with a manikin. The third and last, is a methodology for eliciting user com- ments. Ergonomie evaluation methods and tests with a computer support and generate information that may lead to reduced product development cost. These kinds of tools are also suitably used in cross-functional project groups in order to visualize alternative designs, and evaluations in a participative process. Visualization of traffic, driver and eye-movements seems to open up the discussion and is a step to a more user-centered design process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2115. Ergonomie evaluation of an aircraft cockpit with RAMSIS 3D human modeling software. Peter A. van der Meulen, Tecmath of North America , Inc.; and Perry DiClemente, Eclipse 500 Engineering. The 3D digital human model RAMSIS, which is primarily used in the automotive industry, has been used to predict probable pilot behavior in a proposed cockpit design for the Eclipse 500 jet. The results were used to detect potential accommodation problems as early as possible, as well as to establish guidelines and requirements for further design of the cockpit and interior components. Defining interactions between a digital human model and a CAD environment, such that it reflects interaction between real pilots and cockpits as realistically as possible, is often an arbitrary process. Nevertheless, 3D human models prove to be powerful design tools for aircraft cockpit designers to ensure functional and comfortable accommodation of the target pilot population. 2001-01-2116. Development of a checklist for the use of anthropometric man-models. Iemkje A. Ruiter, Delft University of Technology. One of the elective courses for students of Industrial Design Engineering is ADAPS (Anthropometric Design Assessment Pro- gram System). During this course students learn to work with the ADAPS anthropometric man-models. We made an analysis of what goes wrong when students use ADAPS. Based on this analysis we developed a checklist for the use of ADAPS, listing what students should be aware of before, during and after the use of an anthropo- metric man-model. Recently we started to use this checklist during the ADAPS course. The checklist and the preliminary results of the use of the checklist in education are presented. 2001-01-2117. Modeling of human thermal comfort. Rom McGufftn, National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Current vehicle climate control systems are dramatically over- powered because they are designed to condition the cabin air mass in a specified period of time. A more effective and energy efficient objective is to directly achieve thermal comfort of the passengers. NREL is developing numerical and experimental tools to predict human thermal comfort in non-uniform transient thermal environ- ments. These tools include a finite element model of human thermal physiology, a psychological model that predicts both local and global thermal comfort, and a high spatial resolution sweating ther- mal manikin for testing in actual vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2118. Application and development of manikin in automobile inner packaging and design system. Ji Jianbo, Li Guofu, and Huang Jinling, Jilin Univ. of Technology. This paper focuses on the importance, classification, foundation method of the manikin for design in automobile inner packaging system. Also the positioning in the auto-body system is included. Many kinds of manikins, which are exclusively used in auto-body packaging system, are developed. Lastly, the application of the man- ikin in auto-body packaging system is discussed. Some examples to demonstrate the application are also given. 2001-01-2119. Human modeling and e-manufacturing. M. Geyer and B. Rösch, Tecnomatix Technologies. Manufacturers are forced to reduce the time-to-market and time- to-customer of their products. At the same time the market requires shorter product life cycles (Milberg 1994). To meet these challenges manufacturers must speed up the planning process. At the same time to ensure a high ergonomie quality of production processes it is important to consider ergonomie aspects early in the planning pro- cess (Bubb &amp; Bubb 1996). E-Manufacturing is the answer to cope with these requirements. It enables a short and effective planning and engineering process by an e-Manufacturing server which con- tains all the relevant planning data. Ergonomie knowledge and best practices can be captured and reused for modeling all over the extended enterprise. E-Manufacturing also has an enormous impact on the human modeling itself enabling the user to save predefined moving sequences as attachment to the work operations in a corpo- rate planning database. 2001-01-2120. Modeling of effort perception in lifting and reaching tasks. Kyunghan Kim, Bernard J. Martin, Don B. Chaffin, and Charles B. Woolley, University of Michigan. Although biomechanics models can predict the stress on the mus- culoskeletal system, they cannot predict how the muscle load associ- ated with exertion is perceived. The short-term goal of the present study was to model the perception of effort in lifting and reaching tasks. The long-term goal is to determine the correlation between objective and subjective measures of effort and use this information to predict fatigue or the risk of injury. Lifting and reaching tasks were performed in seated and standing situations. A cylindrical object and a box were moved with one hand and two hands, respec- tively, from a home location to shelves distributed in the space around the subject. The shoulder and torso effort required to perform these tasks were rated on a ten point visual analog scale. Statistical 269</page><page sequence="269">2001-01-2120-2001-01-2132 regression models were developed to determine the effects of target location, gender, age, strength, stature, hands used, and condition (seated or standing) on the perception of effort at the shoulder and low back, respectively. 2001-01-2121. Validating a physics-based simulation of a load carriage task. Robert Playter, William Blank , Darrin Jewell , and Nancy Cornelius, Boston Dynamics Inc.; Jerry Pratt, Yobotics Inc.; and John Obušek, U.S. Army Research Institute of Environ- mental Medicine. Boston Dynamics is developing the Digital Biomechanics Labo- ratory (DBL), a physics-based modeling tool for simulating humans and equipment. A key distinction of the DBL is the ability to simu- late actively controlled human behavior, tasks such as walking, run- ning, and carrying loads. The DBL combines forward dynamics simulation of the body, contact detection, contact force modeling, equipment modeling, and advanced control to simulate realistic human tasks. We are using the DBL to study the biomechanics of load carriage. In this paper we report on our effort to validate the simulation through comparisons to live subject experiments. 2001-01-2122. Modeling population distributions of subjec- tive ratings. Matthew P. Reed and Carol A. C. Flannagan, Univer- sity of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Most human figure models used in ergonomie analyses present postural comfort ratings based on joint angles, and present a single comfort score for the whole body or on a joint-by-joint basis. The source data for these ratings is generally derived from laboratory studies that link posture to ratings. Lacking in many of these models is a thorough treatment of the distribution of ratings for the popula- tion of users. Information about ratings distributions is necessary to make cost-effective tradeoffs when design changes affect subjective responses. This paper presents experimental and analytic methods used to develop distribution models for incorporating subjective rat- ing data in ergonomie assessments. 2001-01-2125. Identification of an organic impurity leaching from a prototype ISS water container. Jeffrey A. Rutz and John R. Schultz , Wyle Laboratories. Collapsible bladder tanks called Contingency Water Containers (CWCs) have been used to transfer water from the Shuttle to the Mir and the International Space Station (ISS). Because their use as pota- ble water storage on the ISS is planned for years, efforts are under- way to improve the containers, including the evaluation of new materials. Combitherm®, a multi-layer plastic film, is a material under evaluation for use as the CWC bag material. It consists of lay- ers of linear low-density polyethylene, ethylene- vinyl alcohol copol- ymer, nylon, and a solvent-free adhesive layer. Long-term studies of the quality of water stored in Combitherm bladders indicate a gradual but steady increase in the total organic carbon value. This suggests a leaching or breakdown of an organic component of the Combitherm. The NASA Johnson Space Center Water Laboratory's routine set of chemical analyses was not identifying significant por- tions of this total organic carbon, implying that the compounds leaching into the water were escaping detection. Liquid chromatog- raphy/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis suggested the presence of no major contaminants other than caprolactam, the monomer of Nylon 6. The LC/MS analysis led to a more direct and accurate method of quantification of caprolactam, using direct-injection high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Re-analysis of the water samples by the HPLC method seemed to completely account (within experimental error) for the total organic carbon in the water samples. Shortcomings of the previous liquid-liquid extraction method for quantifying caprolactam by gas chromatogra- phy/mass spectrometry are discussed. Drawbacks of the new method are also described along with approaches to resolving gen- eral problems with carbon accountability in recycled water. 2001-01-2128. Burkholderia cepacia biofilm growth and dis- infection in microgravity. Barry H. Pyle, Susan C. Broadaway, and Gordon A. McFeters, Montana State Univ. Long-term space flight missions will require high-quality water to lessen the risk of crew infections and system deterioration. In water systems on earth, biofilms contribute to loss of water quality, causing corrosion, increased flow resistance and reduced heat trans- fer. Some bacteria grow more rapidly and become less susceptible to antimicrobial agents under conditions of microgravity, and humans may have weakened immunity with prolonged space flight. This study aimed to determine the effects of spaceflight and micro- gravity on biofilm formation by Burkholderia cepacia in water and microbial control by iodine. The results showed that B. cepacia formed biofilms when incubated in microgravity and in ground con- trols. Compared to rich medium or water, biofilms developed at sim- ilar densities in iodinated water. Thus, disinfection and maintenance of spacecraft water systems should take into account the difficulties of controlling attached bacteria, which are commonly encountered in earth-based systems. 2001-01-2130. Simulation to support an integration test proj- ect of CEEF. Hiroyuki Miyajima, Tokyo Jogakkan Junior College; Koichi Abe and Keiji Nitta, Institute for Environmental Sciences; Yoshio Ishikawa, Nihon Univ.; and Akira Ashida, Institute for Future Technology. A simulation of an open mode system experiment was run using the same experimental conditions as an integration test conducted from September 1999 to February 2000 using the Closed Plant Experiment Facility at the Institute for Environmental Sciences in order to evaluate the operation of closed mode system to be con- ducted in future. Operation of the open mode system experiment required a supply of water and carbon dioxide from the outside, and the discharge of nutrient waste water and oxygen. The present simu- lation verified the feasibility of using non-integrated wet-oxidation processor, nutrient synthesis unit and nutrient waste water processor connected within a closed mode system, and it was confirmed that sufficient material circulation could be achieved when rice and soy- beans were divided into six beds with different growing stages to facilitate control of the nutrient solution. 2001-01-2131. Data on human mass balance obtained in a manned test of regenerative life support systems. Takanobu Shi- moda, National Space Development Agency of Japan; and Atsuko Ohwada and Kazuhiro Toda, Advanced Engineering Services. This paper presents the results of data measurements for a human material balance, which were conducted as part of a 2-day manned test of a regenerative Environmental Control and Life Support Sys- tem (ECLSS) in an isolation chamber. The manned test was carried out using a man-rated closed chamber operated in airtight mode at the Tsukuba Space Center of NASD A (National Space Develop- ment Agency of Japan), Tsukuba, Japan. A five-person Japanese test crew resided inside the isolation chamber for 48 consecutive hours, living and working along a time schedule based upon Space Shuttle and ISS activities. Data measured on human material needs and effluents included drinking water and beverages, food, urine, feces, water vapor (latent respiration and perspiration), and metabolic trace gases, which were measured directly with scales or estimated indi- rectly in various ways, such as measuring crew weight change, or measuring air temperature and humidity. Based on those data we made a human material balance numerical model and compared the results to similar models that have been developed. 2001-01-2132. Connection between different compartments of the MELISSA biological life support system. Fernando Cabe- llo, Núria Creus, Julio Pérez , Joan Albiol, and Francese Gódia, Universität Autònoma de Barcelona; and Christophe Lasseur, European Space Agency. 270</page><page sequence="270">2001-01-2132-2001-01-2138 The MELISSA (Micro Ecological Life Support System Alterna- tive) project of the European Space Agency (ESA) is a tool for the development of a simplified biological life support system. In order to achieve this purpose a loop of four interconnected bioreactors and a higher plant compartment has been designed. The target of the loop is to recycle the wastes, mainly CO2 and organic materials, gen- erated in a closed environment such as in manned space missions, into oxygen, water and edible material. Light is the only energy source used to reach this goal. As a part of the development of the project, a Pilot Plant laboratory has been set up. The role of this pilot plant is to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the Melissa concept. In order to study the system two kinds of experiments are required. On one hand, each compartment has to be well character- ized and, on the other hand, the performance of the connection between compartments has to be evaluated. Different experiments dealing with the connection between compartments II (photo- heterotrophic bacteria degrading volatile fatty acids resulting from the hydrolysis of wastes), III (nitrifying bacteria transforming ammonium into nitrate) and IV (photoautotrophic bacteria Spirulina platensis providing edible material) are presented in this work. The experiments with the interconnected bioreactors are of key importance in order to assure the satisfactory operation of the sys- tem, not only at optimal conditions but also taking into account pos- sible deviations in the behaviour of any of them. Two different devi- ations from the optimal conditions in the connection of these com- partments have been studied: the income of volatile fatty acids in compartment III and the income of nitrite in compartment IV. None of these two deviations produced any significant modification on the performance of these bioreactors. These results assure that the nor- mal operation of the loop is not significantly affected by a temporal malfunction of one of its components. 2001-01-2133. Integration of sequential cultivation of main crops and gas and water processing subsystems using closed ecology experiment facilities. Yasuhiro Tako , Ryuji Arai, Koji Otsubo, and Keiji Nitta, Institute for Environmental Sciences. The Closed Ecology Experiment Facilities (CEEF) can be used as a test bed for Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS), because technologies developed for the CEEF system facilitate self-sufficient material circulation. Two experiments were conducted from September 27, 1999 to February 17, 2000 and from September 28, 2000 to February 9, 2001 in this study. In both exper- iments, rice and soybeans were cultivated sequentially in each chamber, having a cultivation bed area of 30 m2 and floor area of 43 m2, inside the Plantation Module (PM) with artificial lighting of the CEEF. 6 to 8 other vegetables were also cultivated in a chamber, having a cultivation bed area of 60 m2 and floor area of 65 m2, inside the PM with natural lighting in the first experiment and the second experiment. In both experiments, stable transplant and harvest of each crop were maintained during approximately one month, after approximately 3 months preparatory cultivation. Flows of gas and liquid materials to and from the crops were analyzed during the sta- ble cultivation period. Almost all equipment of the Gas Processing Subsystem (GPS) of the Closed Plantation Experiment Facilities (CPEF) in the CEEF were operated during the period. Parts of the Water Processing Subsystem (WRPS), which are necessary to recy- cle condensed water from plantation and to supply nutrient solution for crops, were also operated. Stable operation of both subsystems was confirmed during the period. Daily averages of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein contained in edible biomass from harvested rice and soybeans were 1.2 -1.3, 1.2 - 1.3, and 1.8 of the necessary amount of each for a standard human activity. 2001-01-2134. Experiments with pressurized root zone to assure reliable nutrients delivery system development and isola- tion from contaminants. Y as Takashima, Ichidai Nursery, Inc. The bioregenerative part of the Advanced Life Support System provides Food Production (FP). Many developments have been made which will support FP in planetary installations. However, a Bioregenerative Life Support System (BLSS) that will support FP in transit (on ISS or trip to Mars) still needs to be developed. Present technology does not offer reliable functions of FP, AR and WP in such conditions. Obviously, growing plants in transit vehicles is dif- ficult due to constraints much more severe than those for planetary installations. Isolation of foliage chamber from the root chamber will assure the function of nutrient delivery while performing Air Revitalization (AR) and Water Purification (WP). Efficient use of BLSS for these purposes will considerably reduce the dependency on the Physicochemical System contributing greatly towards weight and mass reduction. Unique approaches to manipulate plant growth through development of this system and the benefits from root and foliage chamber isolation with the capability to vary pressure are discussed in this paper. The result will definite serve to make the BLSS more reliable and even programmable to adjust to the fluctu- ating demand of the life support system. 2001-01-2135. Color-based vision tracking for an astronaut EVA assist vehicle. Jamie Lennon and Ella Atkins, University of Maryland. Scenarios for a manned mission to Mars call for astronaut extra- vehicular activity teams to be accompanied by semi-autonomous rovers. These rovers must be able to safely follow the astronauts over a variety of terrain with minimal assistance. We propose a color-based visual tracking system as a high-speed robust sensory approach for astronaut following and present a quantitative analysis of its accuracy over a spectrum of astronaut motion profiles. To evaluate performance, we provide astronaut motion profiles to a simulator and record actual and perceived target location. We characterize tracking accuracy as a function of rover-astronaut sepa- ration distance and astronaut speed and heading. Future plans include closed-loop control of the rover based on visual feedback, rover motion simulation, and target re-acquisition algorithms. 2001-01-2136. The Mars exploration rover: An in situ science mission to Mars. Jacob R. Matijevic, Barry G. Goldstein, and Rich- ard V. Welch, California Institute of Technology. In this paper the concept for a mobile vehicle system which per- forms an in situ science mission to Mars is described. This rover mission with its requirements for driving, positioning at science- selected targets, and remote and in situ measurement will utilize the technologies for hazard avoidance and autonomous navigation sup- ported by ground operation tools which use rover-based imagery for position estimation and motion planning. 2001-01-2137. Program architecture for the robotic explora- tion of Mars. Dave Lavery, NASA Headquarters. NASA has recently completed the definition of a new architec- ture for the exploration of Mars. This paper will present a summary of the new Mars Exploration Program (MEP) architecture, along with a description of the resulting mission queue and science investigations. 2001-01-2138. Long-range rovers for Mars exploration and sample return. Joe C. Parrish, NASA Headquarters. This paper discusses long-range rovers to be flown as part of NASA's newly reformulated Mars Exploration Program (MEP). These rovers are currently scheduled for launch first in 2007 as part of a joint science and technology mission, and then again in 2011 as part of a planned Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. These rovers are characterized by substantially longer range capability than their predecessors in the 1997 Mars Pathfinder and 2003 Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions. Topics addressed in this paper include the rover mission objectives, key design features, and technologies. 271</page><page sequence="271">2001-01-2139-2001-01-2148 2001-01-2139. Crew size, composition, and time: Implications for habitat and workplace design in extreme environments. Marilyn Dudley-Rowley , OPS-Alaska; Stewart Whitney , Niagara Univ.; Sheryl Bishop, University of Texas; Barrett Caldwell, Purdue Univ.; and Patrick D. Nolan, University of South Carolina. The authors report the results of an ongoing study that investi- gates the effects of crew size, composition, mission duration, and mission interval on behavior and performance among polar and space expeditions. The standardized rates for a behavior/ performance indicator constructed during the pilot study displayed distinctive patterns across different crew profiles and settings. Then, a further analysis over the missions in the pilot sample found com- pelling information suggesting that several factors created specific differentials between outside (baseline) groups (e.g., mission con- trollers, 'folks back home') and groups in extreme environments. These differentials reflected how the passage of time was subjecti- vized by crews and how the expeditionary situation was otherwise defined differently from baseline. These analyses suggest that the definition of the long-duration mission, such as a mission to Mars, likely involves more than the issue of real-time duration. Also, crew size and composition of such ventures need to be examined in light of social and behavioral information that can be obtained from the expeditionary record. These analyses hold important implications for habitat and workplace design in extreme environments, such as those to be deployed for Mars surface operations. 2001-01-2142. Space laboratories. Marc M. Cohen, NASA Ames Research Center. This paper presents a review of the development and evolution of space laboratories. Laboratories in space constitute the unique and necessary working environment in which researchers conduct scientific experiments, engineering tests, and technology develop- ment missions. The United States (US) and (former) Soviet Union pioneered space laboratories with the Skylab and Salyut series sta- tions. In the Space Shuttle era, the European Space Agency's (ESA) SpaceLab, the commercial SpaceHab, and shuttle middeck lockers provided experiment accommodations for a broad range of disci- plines. The MIR station provided a suite of laboratories and other facilities. The International Space Station (ISS) will soon provide a multiplicity of laboratories, including the US Lab, the ESA Columbus Module, the 'Kibo' Japan Experiment Module, and other facilities. Beyond the ISS, planetary exploration missions to the Moon and Mars will include Space Laboratories. The design of these laboratories is a critical ingredient of success for science. This paper generates units of analysis for evaluating the design of space laboratories. 2001-01-2143. Extraterrestrial ecology (exoecology). Harry Jones, NASA Ames Research Center. Researchers in astrobiology should develop alternate concepts for the detection of extraterrestrial life. We should search for extra- terrestrial ecology, exoecology, as well as for extraterrestrial biol- ogy, exobiology. Ecology describes the interactions of living things with their environment. All ecosystems are highly constrained by their environment and conform to well-known and inescapable sys- tem design principles. An ecology could exist wherever there is an energy source and living things can employ some method to capture, store, and use the available energy. Terrestrial ecosystems use energy sources including light, organic molecules, and, in thermal vents and elsewhere, simple inorganic molecules. Ecosystem behav- ior is controlled by matter and energy conservation laws and is described by dynamic systems theory. Typically in an ecosystem different molecules are not in chemical equilibrium and scarce mate- rials are conserved, stored, or recycled. Temporal cycles and spatial variations are often observed. The general concepts of exoecology can help guide the search for extraterrestrial life. The best strategy for the detection of extraterres- trial life is probably a mixed strategy. We should use detailed assumptions based on terrestrial biology to guide some but not all future searches for alien life. The systems principles of exoecology seem much more fundamental and inevitable than the analogies with terrestrial biology that are usually accepted in exobiology. We should search for exoecology based on general principles as well as for exobiology using familiar mechanisms. 2001-01-2144. Darwin's Eye - Light at the bottom of the ocean. Michael Flynn and Philip Hammer, NASA Ames Research Center ; Zeev Rosenswig and Thuvan Nguyen, University of New Orleans ; and Wm. Haden Smith, MEDECO Inc. The objective of this work was to determine if chemoautotrophic organisms exist in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents, specifically organisms that have the capability to utilize non-solar electromag- netic radiation. The discriminating criteria used to make this deter- mination was the existence of, or lack of, chlorophyllic compounds in these organisms. Work conducted to this point indicates that pigment-containing microbial species does exist within the hydrothermal vent microen- vironment. Furthermore, it does appear that at least some of these pigments are bacteiochlorophylls. A question still remains unan- swered, that is, are these organisms indigenous to the vent commu- nity or debris from surface environments? 2001-01-2147. An investigation of fatigue during the flexion and extension of the knee as a function of velocity. Susan Ramsey and James Maida, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and Sudhakar Raj ulu, National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). This paper describes the work intended to supplement a previous study of Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) strength fatigue data, collected from a variety of joints at a fixed velocity (60 degrees/ second), by collecting torque data of a single joint (knee) over time, unsuited, under a condition of multiple fixed velocities. Knee flexion and extension torque values were evaluated for 8 subjects at 60, 120, 180, and 240 degrees per second. Subjects were consid- ered 'fatigued' when they reached 30% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), or after 5 minutes of testing had elapsed. Results indicated that over the five-minute testing period, sub- jects' available torque output decreased to 40% of their MVC, and then reached a plateau at this level. For lower velocities, subjects gradually decreased from their MVC, but their overall decrease in torque over the five-minute period was high. For higher velocities, subjects experienced a sharp decline in torque output at the begin- ning of the trial, but quickly reached a plateau and had an overall smaller decrease in torque compared with lower velocities. Subjects were able to maintain a more constant torque at higher velocities at the beginning of a trial. These results will be correlated to the EMU data when it has been collected and processed, and a mathematical fatigue model will be built to aid designers and mission planners in evaluating EVA activities. 2001-01-2148. Elbow strength in reference to various shoul- der positions. Maitri Dhutia, Johnson Engineering/Spacehab; Tara Ruttley, National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and Sud- hakar Rajulu, National Space Biomedical Reseach Institute. The objective of this study was to accurately characterize the elbow strength capabilities of humans, which is critical for support- ing crewmember on-orbit activities. Space crewmembers depend heavily on their arm strength, it is essential to provide elbow/joint strength data when the shoulder is in various positions within a three-dimensional space. This study measured six individuals' elbow strengths at 12 shoulder positions using a standard LIDO Multi- Joint II isokinetic dynamometer and Lab View data acquisi- tion system. Findings showed that elbow strength decreased with outward shoulder joint rotation and with decreased shoulder flexed position compared to other possible shoulder positions. 272</page><page sequence="272">2001-01-2149-2001-01-2156 2001-01-2149. Effect of orientation on human posture in neu- tral buoyancy and parabolic flight. Julianne Zimmerman , Pay- load Systems Inc.; and David L Akin, University of Maryland Space Systems Laboratory. Neutral buoyancy (NB) and parabolic flight (PF) are the only presently available human-scale three-dimensional spaceflight sim- ulation environments, and as such, both NB and PF are used exten- sively to simulate spaceflight conditions for both research and mis- sion operations purposes. However, there is little or no quantitative (or even qualitative) material in the literature to characterize the fidelity of either environment to its analog. The present study was undertaken as part of a larger research effort to begin to build such characterizations. Eight healthy adults (4 men and 4 women) were asked to adopt relaxed postures while 'standing' in space shuttle middeck standard-type foot restraints, in NB and during the Og peri- ods of PF. Subjects were tested in NB in 9 orientations, 3 trials each: Upright; tilted 45° Front, 45° Back, 45° Right, 45° Left; tilted 90° Front, 90° Back, 90° Right, and 90° Left. PF limitations on test time and physical volume prohibited 90° testing; consequently the PF test protocol included only the Upright and 45° orientations. All NB testing was performed at the bottom of a 25' deep NB facility, using SCUBA-certified, experienced test personnel. All PF testing was performed during four flights on the NASA KC-135. Subjects were fully informed of the test protocol prior to and during testing. Reac- tion loads were recorded for each foot independently and normal- ized to subjects' masses; hip, knee, and ankle angles were measured from photographs. Trunk and shank angles (defined respectively by hip-shoulder ray and ankle-knee ray angles to the foot restraint plane) were also recorded. ANOVA (analysis of variance) calcula- tions were performed for individual and group comparisons. All subjects completed all trials for NB; however, some trials were lost during PF, due to subject motion sickness. Nonetheless, statistically significant differences (p&lt;.05) between orientations for each envi- ronment (e.g., PF 45F versus 45B) were present, in agreement with previous orientation results. Differences were also found between environments (NB versus PF), indicating that results from one are not necessarily applicable to the other. 2001-01-2150. Study regarding crewmember water vapor generation rates. Brian Dunaway, Boeing Co. Humidity control continues to be a major concern in the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) and International Space Station Program (ISSP), affecting crew comfort and potential unwanted condensa- tion. All analyses regarding these concerns depend on crewmember respired and perspired water vapor generation rates. However, there appears to be wide variation throughout the Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) community regarding the assumptions of these water vapor generation rates. A study was conducted that includes a survey of past studies accomplished in terrestrial and microgravity environments, with data gathered from SSP, ISSP, and Mir missions. Subsequent data and independent conclusions suggested by SSP and ISSP flight data will also be examined. Analysis of water used by the Orbiter Flash Evaporator System (FES) and crew, condensate collection, urine collection, and dry bulb temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration measurements will be employed to complement the former studies. It is anticipated that analysis of past studies and subsequent flight data will help define the most appropriate values for crewmember water vapor generation rates at expected cabin environment condi- tions during future SSP and ISSP missions. 2001-01-2152. A cooling system for the EAPU shuttle upgrade. Stephen Tongue and Greg Guyette, Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc.; and Brad Irlbeck, NASA Johnson Space Center. The Shuttle orbiter currently uses hydrazine-powered APU's for powering its hydraulic system pumps. To enhance vehicle safety and reliability, NASA is pursuing an APU upgrade where the hydra- zine-powered turbine is replaced by an electric motor pump and bat- tery power supply. This EAPU (Electric APU) upgrade presents several thermal control challenges, most notably the new require- ment for moderate temperature control of high-power electronics at 132°F (55.6°C). This paper describes how the existing Water Spray Boiler (WSB), which currently cools the hydraulic fluid and APU lubrication oil, is being modified to provide EAPU thermal manage- ment. Water Spray Boiler called the Modified WSB (MWSB). 2001-01-2153. Design and development of a hydrophilic- coated evaporator system for heat rejection in space. Hal J. Strumpf, Bon Calayag, and Jeff Knudsen, Honeywell Aerospace. An evaporative heat exchanger system, suitable for rejecting heat in a space environment, has been developed. The system is designed to use water as the évaporant, although other fluids are possible. The major components of the system include an evaporative heat exchanger, water spray nozzles, a back-pressure regulator, a pres- surized water supply tank, and appropriate controls. The heat exchanger is a high-performance aircraft-type plate-fin design, with a proprietary hydrophilic coating applied to the evaporant-side flow passages. The hydrophilic coating promotes good contact between the evaporating water and the hot heat transfer surfaces. 2001-01-2155. Performance validation of a cooling genera- tion system for a pilot thermal garment. Hélène Fourquet, Jean- Pierre Cimino, Alain Genty, and André Rolland, Honeywell- SECAN; and Dominique Carme, and Raphaël Bianconi, Dassault Aviation. Pilots in fighter aircraft can be subjected to high temperatures during ground operating phases in hot climate conditions, especially if APU mode is not available. A Cooling Generation System (CGS) used with a protective ther- mal garment for fighter aircraft pilots has been developed that allows cooling of the pilot in the cockpit. The unit is designed to operate under worst case conditions and requires only that the pilot plugs in upon entering the cockpit. A liquid circulates inside the garment that covers the pilot's torso, arms and head (area under the helmet). The temperatures are defined to guarantee the user's comfort. The pilot can adjust the power delivered by the CGS, i.e., the temperature of the circulating fluid, up to a maximum cooling capacity of 400 W. The CGS design is based on a small variable speed compressor with a brushless motor, which is the outcome of a dedicated development, and a cus- tom-made evaporator and condenser for maximum efficiency and minimum volume. A demonstrator of the CGS has been fabricated and tested with pilots under worst case conditions. In parallel to these tests, efforts have been made to define available volumes inside the cockpit in which the CGS can be fitted. The results of the two studies will be combined to define the flight version of the CGS. This paper describes the cooling performance validation of the CGS on a demonstrator and the design features for accommodation inside the aircraft cockpit. 2001-01-2156. Specification reform of avionics thermal design criteria - An F-15 case study. Myron Eason, Robert N. Lut- ter, and Thomas C. Smith, Boeing Co. Traditional thermal design criteria for avionics equipment are reviewed. Several studies have recently been conducted on the F-15 to assess accuracy of these design criteria. An overview of the study approach and results are presented. Specific topics investigated include: emergency cooling air provisions, cold start-up, hot start-up, normal and transient bay temperatures, and altitude design. The results indicate that many existing design criteria are overly conservative. The study findings suggest that reform of the existing thermal specification process is needed. Many of these reforms are applica- ble to the general aerospace industry and may result in significant acquisition cost savings as a result of the trend toward usage of com- 273</page><page sequence="273">2001-01-2156-2001-01-2163 mereiai electronic parts. The reforms suggested include a new per- formance based thermal specification approach that increases emphasis on aircraft usage and frequency of occurrence. New tran- sient design criteria are also recommended. Questions are raised regarding adequacy of the current equipment qualification process when using the reforms presented. Additional work in this area is suggested. 2001-01-2157. Blind test performance of the ESA FTIR- based multi-component monitoring system for spacecraft air analysis. At l e Honne and lb-Rune Johansen , SINTEF ; Timo Stuf- fier , Kayser-Threde GmbH; and Gijsbert Tan , ESA/ESTEC. Through the last decade ESA (European Space Agency) have developed a TGM (Trace Gas Monitoring) system for spacecraft air analysis from paper study to a fully operational breadboard. The TGM system is a combination of FTIR spectrometry and specially developed analysis techniques. Ongoing work aims at a system flight experiment on, e.g., the Space Shuttle early in 2003. This paper mainly covers the application of the TGM breadboard for a competitive blind testing on unknown multi-gas mixtures arranged by NASA. The TGM HW was applied as is, but a special calibration for the NASA test scenario was made. Four different sys- tem suppliers competed in the testing, and the ESA TGM system performed clearly best. This independently defined and supervised testing has confirmed that the ESA TGM system is reliable to perform quasi-real time gas measurements in the concentration ranges required by ESA. It remains to demonstrate that the even lower detection limits required by NASA can be covered through emphasis on improved sensitivity. 2001-01-2159. Infrared overtone spectroscopy measurements of ammonia and carbon dioxide in the effluent of a biological water processor. R. Claps , D. Leleux, F. V. Englich, and F. K. Tit- tel, Rice Quantum Institute Rice Univ.; M. E. Webber, J. B. Jeffries, and R. K. Hanson, Stanford Univ.; and J. C. Graf, and L. M. Vega, NASA Johnson Space Center. NH3 and CO2 concentration measurements performed on a Bio- logical Water Processor (BWP), under development at NASA-JSC for water recycling, using near infrared laser diode absorption spec- troscopy are reported. The gaseous effluents from the bioreactor are a concern for potentially introducing harmful amounts of NH3 in a spacecraft environment. Furthermore, NH3 and CO2 monitoring is important for understanding the nitrogen and total organic carbon (TOC) balance and conversion dynamics in the BWP, and real time continuous monitoring could reveal dynamic situations that are hard to detect otherwise. Diode lasers operating at wavelengths that access NH3 and CO2 absorption lines near 1.53 ļum and 1.99 pm are used in a portable and automated gas sensor system. Concentration measurements were performed during a 16-day period starting in August 25, 2000, and a 5 -day period starting in November 10, 2000. A sensitivity of 0.7 ppm (signal to noise ratio -SNR- ~ 3) with a pre- cision of 0.2 ppm will be reported for ammonia, and of 1000 ppm (SNR ~3) for CO2. Ammonia levels up to 5.6 ppm were observed, with fluctuating dynamics that depended upon the operating condi- tions of the bioreactor. Carbon dioxide levels fluctuated from 0.05% to 3.5%. 2001-01-2160. ANITA: An FTIR spectrometer flight experi- ment for space craft cabin air analysis. Timo Stuffier, Dirk Kampf, and Herbert Mosebach, Kayser-Threde GmbH; Atle Honne, SIN- TEF; and Gijsbert Tan, ESA/ESTEC. In a multiple-phase ESA project starting in 1990, the technology for trace gas monitoring in a crewed space cabin was developed. Based on optical principles - a Fourier-Transform-Infrared Spec- trometer in combination with sophisticated analysis S/W - the instrument has the characteristics to identify and quantity quasi on- line over 30 most relevant trace gases in air. A system for testing the analysis technology in a shuttle flight is presently under design. The ANITA (Analyzing Interferometer for Ambient Air) develop- ment status and plans for the space flight beginning of 2003 will be reported in this paper. The description of the analysis S/W was already reported in an earlier ICES paper. 2001-01-2161. The use of human modeling of EVA tasks as a systems engineering tool. H. Charles Dischinger, Jr., NASA Mar- shall Space Flight Center ; and Henry J. Schmidt, Boeing Co. Computer-generated human models have been used in aerospace design for more than a decade. They have come to be highly reliable for worksite analysis of certain types of EVA tasks. In many design environments, this analysis comes after the structural design is largely complete. However, the use of these models as a develop- ment tool is gaining acceptance within organizations that practice good systems engineering processes. The design of the United States Propulsion Module for the International Space Station pro- vides an example of this application. The Propulsion Module will provide augmentation to the propulsion capability supplied by the Russian Service Module Zvezda. It is a late addition to the set of modules provided by the United States to the ISS Program, and as a result, faces design challenges that result from the level of imma- turity of its integration into the Station. Among these are heat dissi- pation and physical envelopes. Since the rest of the Station was designed to maximize the use of the cooling system, little margin is available for the addition of another module. The Propulsion Module will attach at the forward end of the Station, and will be between the Orbiter and the rest of ISS. Since cargo must be removed from the Payload Bay and transferred to Station by the Canadarm, there is a potential for protrusions from the module, such as thruster booms, to interfere with robotic operations. These and similar engineering issues must be addressed as part of the develop- ment. In the implementation of good system design, all design solu- tions should be analyzed for compatibility with all affected sub- systems. Human modeling has been used in this project to provide rapid input to system trades of design concepts. For example, the placement of radiators and avionics components for optimization of heat dissipation had to be examined for feasibility of EVA transla- tion paths and worksite development. Likewise, the location of and mechanism for the retraction of thruster booms was partly driven by available Orbiter, robotic arm, and other module envelopes; work- site analysis was required for early assessment of task success. Since these trade studies included the EVA analysis as part of the decision criteria, the design had a high degree of assurance of EVA support- ability from the outset. This approach contributes greatly to mission success. 2001-01-2162. Modeling space suit mobility: Applications to design and operations. P. B. Schmidt and D. J. Newman, Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology; and E. Hodgson, Hamilton Sundst- rand Space Systems International. Computer simulation of extravehicular activity (EVA) is increas- ingly being used in planning and training for EVA. A space suit model is an important, but often overlooked, component of an EVA simulation. Because of the inherent difficulties in collecting angle and torque data for space suit joints in realistic conditions, little data exists on the torques that a space suit's wearer must provide in order to move in the space suit. A joint angle and torque database was compiled on the Extravehicular Maneuvering Unit (EMU), with a novel measurement technique that used both human test subjects and an instrumented robot. Using data collected in the experiment, a hysteresis modeling technique was used to predict EMU joint torques from joint angular positions. The hysteresis model was then applied to EVA operations by mapping out the reach and work enve- lopes for the EMU. 2001-01-2163. Phase VI advanced EVA glove development and certification for the International Space Station. David Graziosi and James Stein, ILC Dover, Inc.; and Amy Ross and Joseph Kosmo, NASA Johnson Space Center. IIA</page><page sequence="274">2001-01-2163-2001-01-2169 Since the early 1980's, the Shuttle Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) glove design has evolved to meet the challenge of space based tasks. These tasks have typically been satellite retrieval and repair or EVA-based flight experiments. With the start of the Inter- national Space Station (ISS) assembly, the number of EVA based missions is increasing far beyond what has been required in the past; this has commonly been referred to as the 'Wall of EVA's.' To meet this challenge, it was determined that the evolution of the current glove design would not meet future mission objectives. Instead, a revolution in glove design was needed to create a high performance tool that would effectively increase crewmember mis- sion efficiency. The results of this effort have led to the design, certification and implementation of the Phase VI EVA glove into the Shuttle flight program. 2001-01-2164. The effects of extravehicular activity gloves on human hand performance. Mellisa H. Welsh and David L Akin, Space Systems Laboratory University of Maryland. Past approaches to space suit glove evaluation have primarily been subjective. This report details efforts at the University of Mary- land Space Systems Laboratory to use standardized dexterity tests and advanced biomechanics instrumentation to provide objective measures of glove performance. Ten subjects participated in the study. Tests were conducted barehanded, and wearing pressurized and unpressurized space suit gloves. Data on performance time, range of motion, dexterity, strength, fatigue, and comfort were col- lected. Range of motion data was measured using an experimental data glove that instrumented the movement of the joints of the right hand. The results indicated that performance time wearing pressur- ized gloves is not adequately estimated by performance wearing unpressurized gloves. Also, joint angle results indicated a decrease in the range of motion from the barehanded condition, but no signifi- cant difference between the gloved-hand conditions. Thus, range of motion is adequately estimated for the pressurized condition by examining range of motion wearing unpressurized gloves. Results of this research indicate that the use of standardized dexterity tests, with appropriate modifications to accommodate the restricted dex- terity, provides a useful basis for evaluating space suit glove performance. 2001-01-2165. Physiological effects of a mechanical counter pressure glove. D. Tourbier and J. Knudsen, Honeywell Interna- tional, Inc.; A. Margens, K. Tanaka, and J. Waldie, University of California ; P. Webb, Yellow Springs ; and C. Jarvis, Clemson Univ. The first concept and early experiments of a Mechanical Counter Pressure (MCP) spacesuit were published by Webb in the late 1960's. MCP provides an alternative approach to the conventional full pressure suit that bears some potential advantages, such as increased mobility, dexterity, and tactility. The presented ongoing research provides a thorough investigation of the physiological effect of mechanical counter pressure applied onto the human skin. Preliminary results are presented from glovebox testing with an existing MCP glove. The data indicates that properly applied mechanical counter pressure greatly reduces the effect of low- pressure exposure, which makes MCP a viable technology for spacesuit gloves. 2001-01-2166. Thermal conductivity of lofty nonwovens in space and planetary vacuum environment. Henry H. Tang, GB Tech, Inc.; and Evelyne S. Orndoffand Luis A. Tr evino, NASA John- son Space Center. For planetary exploration, new thermal insulation materials are needed to deal with unique environmental conditions presented to extravehicular activity (EVA). The thermal insulation material and system used in the existing space suit were specifically designed for low orbit environment. They are not adequate for low vacuum con- dition commonly found in planetary environments with a gas atmo- sphere. This study attempts to identify the types of lofty nonwoven thermal insulation materials and the construction parameters that yield the best performance for such application. Lofty nonwovens with different construction parameters are evaluated for their ther- mal conductivity performance. Three different types of fiber mate- rial: solid round fiber, hollow fiber, and grooved fiber, with various denier, needling intensity, and web density were evaluated. They were tested in three different vacuum conditions: low orbit high vac- uum (10~5 torr), intermediate vacuum (103 torr), and Mars atmo- sphere low vacuum (8 torr), using the guarded-hot-plate method. The performance of the materials was correlated with each construc- tion parameter. The results show that the grooved fiber material is the best insulation material among the three types of fiber tested. The geometry of the grooved fiber lengthens the path for heat trans- fer and lowers the thermal conductivity of the material. More testing and data are needed in order to validate the trend to relate the ther- mal conductivity performance of the materials to the fiber size, nee- dle intensity, and web density of the materials. 2001-01-2167. Advanced, lightweight, space suit primary life support system for Mars exploration. Joel D. Goldfarb and Edward W. Hodgson, Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems Interna- tional, Inc. Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International (HSSSI) has been conducting an internal research and development study of an integrated portable life support system design for advanced explora- tion missions. This design combines several new subsystem and component concepts to achieve dramatic reductions in system weight and consumables and increased reliability and safety. The study includes the design and manufacture of subsystems and com- ponents and the assembly and test of an integrated bench top system prototype. The system design and the results of testing and analysis are described. 2001-01-2168. Concept of space suit enclosure for planetary exploration. I. Abramov, N. Moiseyev, and A. Stoklitsky, RD&amp;PE Zvezda. At present advanced projects of the early XXI century are begin- ning to develop. These projects include lunar base development and manned missions to Mars. The space suit is one of the basic require- ments for successful implementation of future programs. The space suit enclosure enables mobility of crewmembers wearing pressur- ized space suits which will be required to complete these missions. Requirements on Planetary Space Suit (PSS) enclosure design, especially for elements providing mobility of the lower torso assem- bly will be different from these on orbital space suit enclosure design, intended for zero gravity conditions. The PSS enclosure provides cosmonaut/astronaut movement on planetary exploration surfaces, ascent/descent of the Landing Mod- ule ladder, suited crewmember' s bending, etc. Thus this PSS com- ponent will play a considerable role in successful fulfillment of extra- vehicular activity (EVA) tasks on planetary surfaces. The paper comprises the following: - Analysis of the specific environmental conditions and EVA characteristics on the Moon and Mars - Major PSS enclosure requirements - PSS enclosure design concepts analysis - PSS lower torso assembly concept for the Moon and Mars 2001-01-2169. 'Sleeping with the stars' - The design of a per- sonal crew quarter for the International Space Station. Susan Fairburn and Stuart Walker, University of Calgary. As the International Space Station (ISS) takes shape, the prospect of living in space for prolonged periods becomes a reality for a greater number of individuals. Crewmembers aboard the ISS will live alongside each other for months, in confined spaces, under diffi- cult conditions. Living in a hermetic environment, with other indi- viduals from a variety of cultural backgrounds, will inevitably cause stresses. The living environment must meet a variety of needs in order to be conducive to the well being of the individual and the crew community. 275</page><page sequence="275">2001-01-2169-2001-01-2180 This Master's design project addresses the design of a private, individual, crew quarter. The goal is to meet a crewmember's func- tional requirements, as well as providing the means to achieve pri- vacy and comfort while considering the qualitative aspects of the personal space. The proposed design concept allows for control of body position and of the orientation and layout out of the interior features, thereby offering flexibility of use and personalization. The design attempts to be functionally and aesthetically supportive of a crewmember's well being and productivity in space. 2001-01-2170. Mars habitat studies 2001. Andreas Vogler, Technical University Munich. This paper presents the work done by architecture students at the Institute for Architecture and Product Design at the University of Technology in Munich. The design studio based its studies on the M. A.R.S Mars Arctic Research Station on Devon Island by the Mars Society and the Tuna Can' -Concept of the Mars Reference Mission by NASA. Main subjects of investigation were the greenhouse, the entrance/airlock situation, the work level and the living level. On the living level studies for the kitchen, hygiene facilities and the Crew Quarters have been done. The paper will explain the underlying design ideas and the students' work will be illustrated by many drawings and model photographs. 2001-01-2172. Commercial space habitation. Thomas C. Tay- lor, Global Outpost, Inc. This is 2001, the year society expected to see, and use, the torus shaped, one gravity hotel in the movie '2001, A Space Odyssey.' What happened? The commercial habitation in orbit depicted in the movie has not emerged, but might emerge in the future, if the habita- tion development transportation costs are reduced and a space tour- ist industry is stimulated. Another problem besides cost is bridging the gap between technical hardware orbital requirements, the hotel industry needs, and society's expectations for a space tourist experi- ence. The inflatable TransHab, the space shuttle external tank, entre- preneurial innovation, and the International Space Station can be used to develop commercial habitation and to give society commer- cial alternatives in orbit that satisfy habitation requirements and society's expectations. This paper explores first cut habitation hard- ware requirements and continues to future options for a commercial habitation business in LEO to a point similar to the Authur C. Clarke's vision of a hotel as depicted by Director Kubrick. The key is forging beneficial cooperation between government and industry to open this new commercial space frontier to those who can finance it, profit from it and enjoy it. 2001-01-2174. Mars surface habitats: Architectural designs and concepts for planetary outposts. Barbara Imhof and Hans Schartner, Vienna University of Technology. The work of an architect lies in the creation of specific paths through functionalistic - though 'jungle-like' - realities. The archi- tect searches for new cross-connections to build an inhabitable world, always inscribed with a different meaning yet adapted to ever changing circumstances. The focus of this paper is on new program- matic content, which offers newly inscribed spaces and the freedom of choice for the inhabitant's use. So the architect enlarges the already 'coded' space with a different and new cultural aspect. Thus the architectural form of any final product cannot simply be described as 'Gestalt.' The architectural form derives from its design process. In this paper, examples of architectural design studies for Mars habitats - elaborated under the premises mentioned above - are taken as reference to build Lunar, Martian and other planetary outposts. New concepts of habitats including all human factors for long-term space missions are considered to be of significant importance for a mission's success. The architectural design of the confined space developed with a concern for the psychological and physical well- being, with a concern for the crew's overall performance and safety is the subject of the FUTURE SHELTER project. 2001-01-2177. An evaluation of a fibrous ion exchange resin substrate for the provision of nutrients to wheat growing on a porous tube nutrient delivery system. Georgiana K. Tynes, Thomas W. Dreschel, and Howard G. Levine, Dynamic Corp.; and Hirokazu Kasahara, Hokkaido Tokai Univ. A plant cultivation material known as the Fibrous Ion Exchange Resin Substrate (FIERS) was assessed for its ability to provide nutri- ents to wheat plants growing hydroponically on a porous tube nutri- ent delivery system. Seeds were imbibed and grown on six porous tubes; three at different wetness levels utilizing only the FIERS (as a source of nutrients) and three at comparable wetness levels but with Hoagland's solution used as the source of nutrients. Although there were significant differences between wetness levels and meth- ods of nutrient provision treatments, the FIERS demonstrated the capability to support plant growth through seed production. 2001-01-2178. A microprocessor-based soil moisture sensor system for space-based plant growth units. Robert C. Morrow, Thomas M. Crabb, Ronald J. Anderson, and David J. Smith, Orbital Technologies Corp. A soil moisture sensor system consisting of small heat-pulse probes, a microcontroller, and software for data acquisition and sig- nal conditioning was developed for use in space-based plant growth units. The microcontroller allows the sensors to be used in a control application with minimum time demands on the control subsystem. A single digital serial link may be shared by up to 16 microcontrol- lers with 8 sensors each, for a total of 128 sensors. The microcon- troller independently applies heat cycles to determine the current moisture level, and responds to a request from the computer with the last known value. Using the microcontroller system, repeata- bility testing was completed for wet 1-2 mm arcillite. The standard deviation in wet arcillite over a 16-hour period was about 3%. Soft- ware filtering can be used to reduce the standard deviation further. In addition to determining root zone moisture levels, this system can also be used to monitor root zone temperature and to detect wave- front movement through a dry rooting medium. 2001-01-2179. Fluid handling and maintenance experiment capabilities. Thomas M. Crabb, Timothy K. Klemp, and Robert C. Morrow, Orbital Technologies Corp. The objective of the Fluid Handling and Maintenance Experi- ment (FHAME) is to research, test, and demonstrate liquid/gas phase control in fluid handling subsystems in microgravity. FHAME is currently being developed as a risk mitigation experi- ment for the upcoming verification and science investigations in plant growth systems, especially the Biomass Production System (BPS) and the Plant Research Unit (PRU). Because FHAME con- tains controlled fluid handling systems, a large suite of sensors, data acquisition, and visual observation capability, it is well suited for empirical research and testing of movement and to assessing the liq- uid/gas characteristics for a wide variety of applications. Its first application is to assess fluid priming and gas/liquid characteristics in a particulate bed. FHAME can play a major role in the develop- ment of future new nutrient delivery systems for plant growth appli- cation in addition to many fluid and gas/liquid empirical research investigations. 2001-01-2180. Evapotranspiration and photosynthesis char- acteristics of two wheat cultivars measured in the biomass pro- duction system. G. W. Stutte, O. M. Monje, G. D. Goins, and L. M. Ruffe, Dynamac Corp. A 24-day test of the science protocols for the PESTO (Photosyn- thesis Experiment System Testing and Operation) experiment was conducted in the Biomass Production System (BPS) flight hardware. One objective of these experiments was to identify the optimum times during the life cycle for characterizing canopy level évapo- transpiration and photosynthesis under closed atmosphere condi- tions in the BPS. Carbon dioxide and light response curves were obtained at three stages of development on two dwarf wheat culti- 276</page><page sequence="276">2001-01-2180-2001-01-2185 vars, Apogee and Super Dwarf. Net daily carbon assimilation rates were derived from CO2 additions to each chamber and the relative growth rate of each cultivar was determined. Evapotranspiration rates were derived from water additions to the rooting matrix through the nutrient delivery system and water vapor removal from the atmosphere though the humidity control system. The effects of short-term changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on évapotranspi- ration rates was determined on a full canopy of Super Dwarf during programmed changes in BPS temperature and relative humidity set- points.

Anna-Lisa Paul , Chris Daugherty , Elizabeth Bihn, and Robert J. Feri , University of Florida; David Chapman , Dynamac Corp.; and Kelly Norwood ', Bionetics Corp. The initial task in the preparation for Right Experiment PGIM-01 (Plant Growth in Microgravity - 01) was the optimization of the plant nutrient system within the environment of the Plant Growth Facility (PGF - a Space Shuttle middeck locker plant growth unit). PGIM-01 entailed using the Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System (TAGES) to monitor effects of spaceflight- associated stress on gene expression. TAGES plants are genetically engineered arabidopsis plants designed with a sensitive reporter gene system that responds to a variety of environmental stresses. However, transgene expression can also be influenced by back- ground environmental conditions. Thus, minimizing sources of background stress on the plants was crucial to ensure optimal growth and a high scientific return. 2001-01-2182. Aspects on plant growth using EMCS hard- ware. Anders Johnsson, Gunnar Prytz, Tor-Henning Iv er sen, Hãkon Svare, Johnny Svendsen, and Knut R. Fossum, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU); and Peter Schiller, ESTEC/ESA. As a link in the development of the European Modular Cultiva- tion System (EMCS) and under a separate contract with ESA (FUMO Study), functionality and biocompatibility studies of plants have been performed. The main goal has been to test if a breadboard (FUMO BB) containing major components planned for use in the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) is optimal for space experiments with plant material. Initially in the study the authors had to perform technical improvements in order to facilitate a more optimal function of the BB-model. A test plan and the experimental set-up for the verification of the biocompatibility and biological functionality included a selection of a few model plant species [Lepidium sativum L. (cress) and Arabidopsis thaliana] which could be tested at different developmental levels of morphological and physiological complexity. The following test aspects were focused on in order to clarify the biological functionality of the FUMO H/W: Illumination [fluorescent lamps and light emission diodes (LED)], Life Support, Humidity Control, Water Supply, Observation, Short- and Long-Term Plant Growth Experiments and Contamination Pre- vention. The present article summarizes the final outcome of the FUMO Study. The results obtained showed that the modified FUMO BB functioned well, but that some of the services could be improved, e.g., the use of a white plus red LED array gave more optimal plant growth results than fluorescent lamps or white LED. Analysis of the microbial contamination showed that microorganisms were detected in the water filter system. Inside the ECs both fungi and anaerobic bacteria were found after 10 days. Despite the microbial contamina- tion a normal growth and morphology of the plants were demon- strated in the short term (up to 15 days) experiments using cress. Both the short- and the long-duration plant growth experiments using Arabidopsis showed the usefulness of the BB and the experi- ment containers (EC). In the latter case mature Arabidopsis plants as well as viable seeds were obtained after a growth period in the order of 2 months. In parallel with and as a consequence of the FUMO Study and the results obtained, modifications have been made in the concept for the EMCS. The results have also given technical improvements which have been implemented in the EMCS facilities and the Exper- iment Reference Model (ERM) which creates the final basis for the EMCS which will be placed on the International Space Station. 2001-01-2183. Repeatability and additional calibration of a segmental body fluid monitoring device. Jordi Elvira and Xantal Borràs, NTE, S.A.; José Manuel and González de Suso, CAR ; Pierre Brisson, ESTEC-ESA ; and Javier Roseli, UPC. NTE has developed a system (BFM 7 Scan) that provides infor- mation on fluid distribution and composition both for body and body segments (legs, arms, thorax, abdomen and head). The system con- sists of a electronics box controlled with a PC with a dedicated soft- ware. The system has an applied part with 11 electrodes that are located on subject's skin. Using the electrical impedance spectros- copy technology, the system provides the following information: - Total Body Water content for each segment and for whole body - Extracelullar and Intracellular Water content for each segment and for whole body - Fat Mass and Lean body mass NTE has followed with the collaboration of the Olympic Train- ing Center (CAR) in Barcelona (Spain) a refinement of that calibra- tion and characterisation of the system. These activities were as fol- lows: - Assessment on the influence in the measurement due to repo- sitioning of thorax electrode. - Assessment on the influence of type of electrode used. - Assessment of repeatability in the measurement. Additional work is being performed presently on: - Refinement of calibration on fluid content and composition using Magnetic Res- onance Imaging as alternative method. The results of these activities help to demonstrate together with previous work performed that the system BFM 7 Scan can be used to study the body fluid shifts that the astronaut suffer during stay in weightlessness. 2001-01-2184. ISS emergency egress - A system for crew- member pathway indication. Kieran Smart, Charles Bowen, and Dan Carr, SpaceHab; and Jennifer Novak, National Space Biomedical Research Institute. ISS Emergency Egress vehicles include the Soyuz, X-38 Crew Return Vehicle (from 2007), and the Shuttle (when attached). In an emergency evacuation of the station, multiple escape vehicles, each with limited crew capacity, would have to be used. Disorientation may leave a crewmember temporarily unaware of his/her location, and potentially result in confusion as to which direction to travel, particularly a visiting Shuttle crewmember, especially if there is a loss of ISS lighting, and/or vision is obscured due to smoke or decompression fog. We will present a concept based on phosphorescent placards to indicate multiple egress paths on ISS, along with related research and evaluation results demonstrating the efficacy and feasibility. This approach is flexible, adaptable, uses no power, is easily recon- figurable, lightweight, and has minimal impact on crew time and resources. 2001-01-2185. A statistical comparison of the anthropomet- rics of civilian workers to astronauts and astronaut applicants. Michael W. Lee, Cesar G. Lizarazo, Sharath Rao, and Lawrence J. H. Schulze, University of Houston. In this paper, an anthropometric study was undertaken in order to evaluate civilian office workers from a multinational petrochemi- cal company. The purpose of the assessment was to generate a description of the workforce and compare civilian body dimensions to those of a reference population of astronauts and astronaut appli- cants from 1985 to 1991. In this paper, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to determine whether the anthropometric dimen- sions of the civilian workers are normally distributed. Our results 277</page><page sequence="277">2001-01-2185-2001-01-2190 show that of the eleven dimensions tested on the population as a whole and within the male population, only one parameter, hand length, was not normally distributed. Within the female population, only shoulder breadth was not normally distributed. Additionally, a t-test comparison of our database to the reference population found that when comparing the whole population, only height could be considered statistically comparable. 2001-01-2186. Evaluation of anthropometric requirements for the design of an ergometer restraint system. J or di Elvira, Albert Catalan, Xantal Borràs, Albert Tomás, and Miquel Pastor, NTE, S.A.; and José Manual González de Suso, Antonio Turmo, and Xavier Balius, Centre d'Alt Rendiment (CAR). NTE is developing a system for neuromuscular research (MARES: Muscular Atrophy Research and Exercise System). This system is an ergometer to be flown and installed in the International Space Station in the year 2004 and is consisting of a motor, an HRS (Human Restraint System) and a control electronics that controls the motor. The subject is connected to the motor by means of the restraining system HRS. This ergometer can be used for 11 move- ments (wrist flexion/extension, pronation/supination and radial/ ulnar deviation, trunk flexion/extension, arm pull/press, leg pull/ press, elbow flexion/extension, Shoulder flexion/extension, hip flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension and ankle dorsal/plantar flexion). MARES is a research tool for physiologists, but also interesting for human factors people. It is a tool to quantitatively measure the physical condition of a person before performing a physically demanding task (e.g., EVA), a tool for health monitoring and to ver- ify the efficiency of countermeasures against microgravity decondi- tioning. The HRS must meet the following anthropometric range: from 5 percentile Japanese female to a modified 95 percentile American male. A design report of the HRS was produced. This document included all the needed adjustments of the HRS to be compliant with all the population and with other requirements applied to the ergom- eter. One of the characteristics of this HRS is that the number of adjustments is high. Comments on why such a big number of adjust- ments were needed arose among reviewers of the system. We would like to clarify what are the different influences of the requirements on that high number of adjustments. An analysis on the influence of the anthropometrics on the number of adjustments of the system is supplied in this paper. Tests to assess the validity of that HRS were carried out with a broad population. We present in this paper one of these tests: com- parison test of three ankle dorsal/plantar flexion adapters. These adapters were the following: a commercial adapter from a commer- cial ergometer, an adapter already flown in the Space Shuttle and the ankle adapter manufactured according to the HRS design report. These tests evaluated the performance of the adapters in a popu- lation of six people covering from 5 percentile Japanese female to a modified 95 percentile American male and considering the follow- ing variables: joint alignment with motor axis and comfort level. All adapters show no significant difference between comfort level (p&lt;0.05). The joint alignment with motor axis was better in HRS adapter and significantly worse in the commercial and the flown adapter (p&lt;0.05). As the adapter of HRS has to be compliant with such joint align- ment requirements, the number of adjustments of a single adapter is much higher than in the other cases. This implies a heavier adapter than in the other cases that have less adjustments in the following order: flown adapter and commercial adapter. From the results obtained, we can conclude that requirements referring to a broad population imply heavier and harder-to-use hardware. It can also be indicated that the joint alignment require- ments imply a high number of adjustments. These two requirements imply a harder to operate and heavier hardware, but a satisfactory scientific equipment that can be used by a broad population. Depending on the type of experiment to be performed, a compro- mise should be pursued. 2001-01-2188. Active control of the operating temperature in a loop heat pipe with two evaporators and two condensers. Jentung Ku, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; and Gajanana C. Birur , Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This paper describes a test program on active control of the oper- ating temperature in a loop heat pipe (LHP) with two evaporators and two condensers. Test results show that when the CCs were not actively controlled, the loop operating temperature was a function of the total heat load, heat load distribution among evaporators, con- denser temperature and ambient temperature. Because of the many variables involved, the operating temperature also showed more hystereses than an LHP with a single evaporator. Tight operating temperature control can be achieved by controlling the compensa- tion chambers (CCs) at a desired set point temperature. Temperature control was achieved by maintaining one or both CCs at the desired set point through cold biasing and external heating. Tests performed included start-up, power cycle, sink temperature cycle, CC tempera- ture cycle, and capillary limit. Test results show that, regardless of whether one or two CCs were heated to the set point temperature, one of the CCs was always flooded with liquid. The loop could oper- ate successfully at the desired set point temperature under most con- ditions, including some fast transients. At low heat loads, however, the CC temperature could suddenly increase above the set point tem- perature, possibly due to an unexpected change of the vapor content inside the evaporator core. 2001-01-2189. An experimental study of the operating tem- perature in a loop heat pipe with two evaporators and two con- densers. Jentung Ku, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; and Gajanana C. Birur, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental study of the loop operating temperature in a loop heat pipe (LHP) which has two parallel evaporators and two parallel condensers. In a single evapo- rator LHP, it is well known that the loop operating temperature is a function of the heat load, the sink temperature and the ambient temperature. The present study focuses on the stability of the loop operating temperature and parameters that affects the loop opera- tion. Tests results show that the loop operating temperature is a function of the total system heat load, sink temperature, ambient temperature, and heat load distribution between the two evaporators. Under most conditions, only one compensation chamber (CC) con- tains two-phase fluid and controls the loop operating temperature, and the other CC is completely filled with liquid. Moreover, as the test condition changes, control of the loop operating temperature often shifted from one CC to another. In spite of complex interac- tions between various components, the test loop has demonstrated very robust operation even during fast transients. 2001-01-2190. Testing of a loop heat pipe with two evapora- tors and two condensers. Jentung Ku, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center ; and Gajanana C. Birur, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Most existing loop heat pipes (LHPs) consist of one single evap- orator and one single condenser. LHPs with multiple evaporators are very desirable for cooling multiple heat sources or a heat source with large thermal footprints. Extending the current LHP technology to include multiple evaporators and multiple condensers faces some challenges, including operating temperature stability, adaptability of loop operation to rapid power and sink temperature transients, and sizing of the compensation chambers (CCs). This paper describes extensive testing of an LHP with two evaporators and two condens- ers. Tests performed include start-up, power cycle, sink temperature cycle, CC temperature cycle, and capillary limit. Test results showed that the loop could be started successfully in most cases, and the operating temperature was a function of the total heat load, heat load distribution between the two evaporators, condenser sink tem- perature and ambient temperature. Under most conditions, only one 278</page><page sequence="278">2001-01-2190-2001-01-2196 CC contained two-phase fluid and the other CC was completely liq- uid filled. Moreover, control of the loop operating temperature could switch from one CC to the other as the test condition changed. Despite the many factors that could affect the loop operation, the LHP demonstrated very robust operation even when subjected to fast transients. 2001-01-2191. Operation of an LHP with multiple heat sources. Walter Bienert and Michael Nikitkin , Dynatherm Corpora- tion, Inc. Loop Heat Pipes (LHP) are widely used in space applications: déployable radiators, instrument cooling and precise temperature control. These applications are utilizing classical LHP designs with single evaporator and single condenser. Traditionally, the LHP is considered as an ideal solution for heat sources with concentrated power. The rule of thumb for a thermal control system based on the LHP is one heat source - one evaporator. It has been demonstrated several times that LHPs with dual evaporators are feasible, however, the volume of the compensation chamber grows dramatically with the number of evaporators. Therefore, LHPs with more than three evaporators are not practical. These restrictions restrict the area of LHP applications. The LHP evaporator generates vapor, which travels through the vapor line toward the condenser. In principle, this vapor could be used to absorb some additional power from heat sources other than the heat source feeding the evaporator. But single-phase heat exchange between these secondary heat sources and the vapor is not very effective. However, if the vapor would be condensed prior to entering the secondary heat source, this condensed vapor with a quality close to zero would absorb significant amounts of heat from the secondary source. Ineffective single-phase heat exchange would be substituted by highly effective two-phase heat exchange. The chain of the secondary condensers and heat sources can be as long as the capillary pressure of the primary wick will permit. Its capil- lary pressure must support the additional hydraulic losses in the sec- ondary condensers and heat sources. The evaporator of the driving pump must be connected to the heat source with the highest power. A system of this type was successfully tested, demonstrating reliable operation over a wide range of powers and temperatures. The paper is describes the test article and discusses the test results. 2001-01-2192. Investigation of low power operation in a loop heat pipe. Jentung Ku and Laura Ottenstein , NASA Goddard Space Flight Center ; Paul Rogers , Army TEC; and Kwok Cheung , Naval Research Laboratory. This paper presents test results of an experimental study of low power operation in a loop heat pipe. The main objective was to dem- onstrate how changes in the vapor void fraction inside the evapora- tor core would affect the loop behavior. The fluid inventory and the relative tilt between the evaporator and the compensation chamber were varied so as to create different vapor void fractions in the evap- orator core. The effect on the loop start-up, operating temperature, and capillary limit was investigated. Test results indicate that the vapor void fraction inside the evaporator core is the single most important factor in determining the loop operation at low powers. 2001-01-2194. 1500 W déployable radiator with loop heat pipe. K. Goncharov, A. Orlov, and A. Tarabrin, Lavochkin Associa- tion ; and M. Gottero, V. Perotto , S. Tavern, and G. P. Zoppo, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. Two-phase capillary loops are being extensively studied as heat collection and rejection systems for space applications as they appear to satisfy several requirements like low weight, low volume, temperature control under variable heat loads and/or heat sink, oper- ation under on-ground and microgravity conditions, simplicity of mounting and heat transfer through tortuous paths. In 1998-2000 Alenia defined and Lavochkin Association devel- oped the Déployable Radiator on the base of honeycomb panels, axial grooved heat pipes and Loop Heat Pipe. It was designed for on-ground testing. When developing new Déployable Radiator the designs of the following key components were engineered and tested: - High- power Loop Heat Pipe evaporator with low weight and extremely low thermal resistance; - Pressure regulator for passive thermal sta- bilization of payload; - Loop Heat Pipe serial/parallel condenser that allows multiple freezing of the working fluid; de-freezing system; - Thermal key that allows the Radiator multiple opening and closing without application of the explosive means (without shock loads). Panel temperature is used for thermal key actuation. Development of new key components made it possible to design Déployable Radiator with specific mass of less than 10 kg/kW. The characteristics of the Déployable Radiator have been described in last ICES 2000 paper 'Development of improved 1500 W Déployable Radiator with Loop Heat Pipe.' For ICES 2001 we updated and expanded the description of dif- ferent units. 2001-01-2195. Across-gimbal ambient thermal transport sys- tem. B. Marland, J. Yun, D. Bugby, and C. Stouffer, Swales Aero- space; and B. Tomlinson, and T. Davis, Air Force Research Labora- tory. This paper describes the development, operation and testing of an across-gimbal ambient thermal transport system (GATTS) for carrying cryocooler waste heat across a 2-axis gimbal. The principal application for the system is space-based remote sensing spacecraft with gimbaled cryogenics optics and/or infrared sensors. GATTS uses loop heat pipe (LHP) technology with ammonia as the working fluid and small diameter stainless steel tubing to transport 100-275 W across a two-axis gimbal. The tubing is coiled around each gim- bal axis to provide flexibility (less than 0.68 N-m [6 lbf-in] of tub- ing-induced torque per axis) and fatigue life. Stepper motors are implemented to conduct life cycling and to assess the impact of motion on thermal performance. An LHP conductance of approxi- mately 7.5 W/C was demonstrated at 200 W, with and without gim- bal motion. At the time this paper was written, the gimbal had suc- cessfully completed over 500,000 cycles of operation with no per- formance degradation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2196. Electrical impedance spectroscopy for on-line estimation of viable biomass. Jordi Elvira, NTE, S.A.; Josep Bujan and Pilar Urpí, FREIXENET, S.A.; Ramon Bragós, Universität Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC); Francese Vayreda, BIOKIT, S.A.; Daniel Blasco, INDECO, S.A.; and Christophe Lasseur, ESA/ ESTEC. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) consists on the mea- surement of electrical impedance at different frequencies. The elec- trical impedance of a biological sample has a specific behavior with respect to the frequency of the electrical current injected. This behavior can be distinguished from that of a sample without cells or with dead cells. NTE started the development of this technology in the frame of a project of the European Space Agency (1) and in collaboration with the UPC. This technology has started a technology transfer process, in which three companies from three different fields: a brewery (Freix- enet, S.A.), a water treatment plant engineering company (Indeco, S.A.) and a pharmaceutical company (Biokit, S.A.) have evaluated the technology for their production requirements. Specifications were issued for each process considered in case: - On-line viable yeast cell determination in CAVA production line. - Determination of viable biomass in activated sludge in the biologi- cal reactor of a water treatment plant. - Determination of Eschericia coli concentration in a protein production process. 279</page><page sequence="279">2001-01-2196-2001-01-2203 NTE designed a system for each case with specific electrodes, electronics and software. These systems were tested at each com- pany in each industrial process. Requirements on Biomass determi- nation in threshold, resolution, repeatability and accuracy were set. The tests have shown compliance of the systems with the require- ments. The following results were obtained for each application: - On- line viable yeast cell determination. The technology is able to mea- sure on-line the amount of viable yeast in the fermentation tanks and monitor the whole growth process. - Determination of viable bio- mass in activated sludge. The technology is able to provide the bio- mass concentration from low concentration values and to give an estimation on the distribution of the population in the activated sludge (from bacterial to algae) Determination of Eschericia coli concentration.

The determination of formaldehyde using thermal desorption - Ion mobility spectrometry. Cathy Veasey and C. L Paul Thomas , University of Manchester Institute of Sci- ence and Technology ; and Tom Limero , Wyle Laboratories. The need has recently arisen for the monitoring of formaldehyde levels during manned space flights. A volatile organics analyzer (VOA) will be currently used to monitor the air directly for other targeted analytes. This consists of a thermal desorption gas chroma- tography ion mobility spectrometer. Formaldehyde can not be mea- sured directly using this method as it needs to be derivatized first to provide a more stable compound. A method previously developed for the analysis of formaldehyde in air using on trap derivatization followed by thermal desorption GC-MS was evaluated at each stage to determine whether the two methods were compatible. 2001-01-2198. Cavity-absorption techniques for the use in a tunable diode laser sensor for monitoring spacecraft air quality. A. R. Awtry and J. H. Miller , George Washington Univ. The progress on the development of a sensor for monitoring spacecraft air quality is reported. A 1 .55 pm external-cavity tunable diode laser is used as a light source that can be incorporated in either cw-Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (cw-ICOS) or cw-Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (cw-CRDS). Both techniques exploit the sensitivity enhancements provided by the long effective pathlength from the optical cavity created between two mirrors. Initial experi- ments of cw-ICOS have been performed to determine the sensitiv- ity, selectivity, and reproducibility of this method. Passing the laser beam through a flame supported on an atomic absorption burner produced a dense spectrum of absorption lines in the 1545-1560 nm region. While most of the absorbance peaks observed in the flame were assigned to water, a number of spectral features have been assigned to the OH radical. Using an estimate of the OH concentra- tion in this flame, the detection limit for OH in this system was determined to be 60 ppm. In the continuing work, the sensitivity of cw-CRDS will be compared with cw-ICOS to determine which method holds greater promise for a practical sensor. 2001-01-2199. Investigation of extravehicular activity requirements and techniques at an arctic Mars analog field sci- ence base. David Etter and Peter Kinsman, Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc.; and Pascal Lee, SETI Institute. Designing an EVA system for Mars' s exploration will require a thorough understanding of the mission. Data are available from NASA mission studies, preliminary EVA requirements document, and Apollo program experience. However, additional relevant field experience is required to complete the picture. NASA has addressed this through field tests using prototype EVA equipment and field science programs like the Haughton Mars Project on Devon Island. There, a group of scientists conducts scientific exploration in and around an impact crater in a polar desert similar to expected explora- tion sites on Mars. Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems Intl. (HSSSI) EVA system engineers participated in the summer 2000 field research program to gain firsthand knowledge of field science activities. By using a Mars EVA system mock-up, they were also able to conduct experiments on EVA system impacts on field sci- ence tasks. This field experience and some of its results are described in this paper. 2001-01-2200. Advanced EVA roadmaps and requirements. Richard K. Fullerton, NASA Johnson Space Center. A wide range of solutions can be theorized for the architectures, technologies and operations concepts of advanced EVA systems for future space and planetary applications. This paper reports on the status of the latest advanced EVA roadmaps and ongoing work to capture and refine an initial set of candidate requirements. A brief summary of related research and development is also presented. The end goal is a cost-effective, safe and resource efficient integrated system that enables work in a diversity of environments at multiple destinations. A balance of cooperative efforts between humans and automated/robotic devices is envisioned to maximize productivity and safety in remote locations. The challenges ahead to be addressed will reflect past lessons learned and visionary new solutions. This information is intended to provide credible and useful guidance for those involved in the eventual implementation, validation and utili- zation of an advanced EVA system. 2001-01-2201. EVA operations using the Spacelab logistics pallet for hardware deliveries. Thomas J. Hagale, Boeing Co. There are a large number of space structures, orbital replacement units (ORUs) and other components that must be transported to orbit on a regular basis for the assembly and maintenance of the Interna- tional Space Station (ISS). Some of this hardware will be ferried on the Spacelab Logistics Pallet (SLP), which has a long and reliable history of space flight successes. The carrier is well used, well quali- fied, and very adaptable for repeated use in accommodating cargoes of various sizes and shapes. This paper presents an overview of past, present and future hard- ware design solutions that accommodate EVA operations on the SLP. It further demonstrates how analysis techniques and design considerations have influenced the hardware development, EVA operations, and compliance with human engineering requirements for the SLP. 2001-01-2202. International Space Station EVA operations- Phase 2 hardware lessons learned. David E. Anderson, Debra A. Meyer, and Kashyap Shah, Boeing Extravehicular &amp; Crew Systems. Phase 2 of International Space Station (ISS) assembly is sched- uled to be complete by mid 2001. This paper will describe lessons learned by the hardware providers relative to Extravehicular Activ- ity (EVA) operation for that hardware. With the completion of flight 7 A scheduled for June 2001, the space station will include the first set of US solar arrays, KU band and S band antennas, Laboratory module, Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), and Airlock, all EVA assembled. Previously launched hardware will be reconfigured by EVA multiple times to accommodating the chang- ing configuration of the space station to maintain operability. Since the use of EVA is critical to everything from attaching whole seg- ments to installation of external hardware, to reconfiguration of thermal blankets, the EVA operability of this hardware has been an important aspect of the design. Many EVA operations, while well trained for, have not been previously attempted on-orbit. This paper will discuss the hardware lessons learned from completed Phase 2 assembly flights. 2001-01-2203. Evaluation of various hand controllers for use by a space-suited subject. Lauren S. Shook and David L. Akin, Uni- versity of Maryland at College Park. The Space Systems Lab has evaluated several different types of generic hand controllers to see which performs the best when used by a suited subject. This paper outlines the types of hand controllers selected for this experiment and the results of the performance test- 280</page><page sequence="280">2001-01-2203-2001-01-2210 ing. The evaluation was conducted by subjects wearing spacesuit gloves in a partial pressure glovebox at a pressure differential of 4.3 pounds/square inch. Performance for each hand controller was mea- sured by the completion of several one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) tasks presented to the subject on a computer screen. Performance metrics for this experiment included the error associated with attempting to follow an ideal trajectory and a subjective Cooper- Harper questionnaire given after each session was complete. The same information was also collected for unpressurized suit gloves and for the bare hand. 2001-01-2204. Lessons learned from Hubble Space Telescope extravehicular activity servicing missions. Russell L Werneth, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope was designed for periodic ser- vicing by Space Shuttle astronauts performing extravehicular activi- ties (EVAs), to service, maintain, repair, and upgrade the telescope. Through three successful servicing missions to date, EVA processes have been developed by applying a series of important lessons learned. These lessons learned are also applicable to many other future human spaceflight and robotic missions, such as International Space Station, satellite retrieval and servicing, and long-duration spaceflight. HST has become NASA's pathfinder for observatories, EVA development, and EVA mission execution. 2001-01-2205. Bioprocessing to recover crop nutrients from ALS solid wastes: A two-stage solid-liquid separation system for removal of particulates from bioreactor 'broth'. Richard F. Stray er, Mary Hümmerich, and Valdis Krumins, Dynamac Corp.; and Dwight Back, and Charlie Ramos, Mainstream Engineering. The effluent, or 'broth' output of bioreactors fed Advanced Life Support (ALS) solid wastes contains suspended particulate material composed of undigested waste residues and microbial cells. ALS crop scientists have required the removal of particulates from these solutions before they can be used to recycle soluble crop nutrients, also contained in the effluents, to hydroponie crop growing systems. A two-stage filtration system was designed and evaluated with dif- ferent membrane filtration elements. The first stage, prefiltration, was designed to remove large particles (pm to mm range). The key study factors for prefiltration were: (1) filter bag pore size - 50 vs. 5 vs. 0.5 pm- and (2) rinse solution - none, de-ionized water, and simulated graywater). Between 22 to 30% of the liquid was retained by the pre-filters and retained solids, indicating the necessity of introducing a rinsing step to better recover soluble crop nutrients. Between 66 and 70% of total solids (TS) were removed by the pre- filter. Filtrates contained very small particulates. Filter bag pore size had no effect on recovery of major crop nutrients, e.g. K, Ca, Mg. Rinsing of the filter and retained solids resulted in a significant increase in mineral recovery including K: 24 - 32%, Ca: 33 - 48%, and Mg: 24 - 40%. The key study factors for membrane filtration were: (1) filter type (pore size) - microfiltration (0.2 pm) versus ultrafiltration (500,000 nominal molecular weight cutoff) and (2) flow-rates - 150 vs. 450 mL min"1. Membrane filter type and flow rate had no influence on recovery of permeate, 93 - 96%, and little effect on recovery of crop nutrients, 95 - 103% for K, Ca, and Mg-no trends). Filtration time for the microfilter at the 450 mL min 1 flow rate was the best (i.e., shortest) measured, 12 hrs to reach a pressure cutoff of 10 psi. 2001-01-2206. Microbial requirements for optimal surfactant degradation in a denitrifying, fixed-bed bioreactor. Mary P. Hummerick, Jennifer J. Judkins, and Jay L. Garland, Dynamac Corp.; and Jay L. Garland, Levine, Lanfang H. Ground studies at Kennedy Space Center were conducted to determine microbial requirements of the Immobilized Microbe Microgravity Water Processing System (IMMWPS), a denitrifying, fixed-bed reactor designed for Shuttle flight- testing. The reactor was operated with a simulated graywater 'waste stream' containing the surfactant Igepon TC-42™ as the sole carbon source. Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and feed nutrient composition on surfactant degradation. The source of inoculum as well as procedure for inoculating the reactor was also examined. A complete nutrient mix in the feed formulation was required for sustained Igepon degradation throughout the reac- tor runs at the short (1.4 days) and intermediate (1.9 days) hydraulic retention time (HRT), regardless of inoculum source. 2001-01-2208. Bioprocessing to recover crop nutrients from advanced life support (ALS) solid wastes: Improving rapid bio- logical processing of ALS inedible crop residues. Richard Stray er, Val Krumins, and Mary Hummerick, Dynamac Corp.; and Cody Nash, International Space Univ. The overall objective of a NASA Research Announcement- funded project at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is to determine the optimal Advanced Life Support (ALS) solid waste bioprocessing system with the limited goal of nutrient recycling as part of a poten- tial hybrid biological-physical chemical (PC) system. Bioprocess research towards this objective has focused on comparing two bioreactor technologies: (1) continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)- suspension culture and (2) continuous flow fixed-film bioreactor (FFB)- which utilizes biofilms to remove organic constituents from crop residue leachate solutions. For optimizing the CSTR we stud- ied the effects of solids loading rate (160, 240, and 320 grams dry weight [gdw] day"1) and stirrer speed (45, 90, 180, and 360 rpm) on the vertical distribution (5 depths) of dissolved oxygen (&gt; 90% oxy- gen in aeration gas) and total suspended solids in a CSTR operated at an hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1.25 days. The only signifi- cant stratification of dissolved oxygen (DO) and solids occurred at the slowest stirring rate, 45 rpm. At all solid loading rates the verti- cal distribution of solids were fairly similar for the 90, 180 and 360 rpm speeds. At the 180 rpm stirrer speed and the 320 gdw day"1 load- ing rate the DO fell below 2 ppm, so lower stirring speeds were not tested at this loading rate. Mixing due to aeration had a significant effect on the vertical distribution of DO and solids. For the FFB, two different designs have been employed: (1) a trickling bed bioreactor - which experienced severe foaming problems, and (2) a continuous flow, suspended-bed, floating-bead biofilm attachment matrix with aeration provided by recirculation of bioreactor liquid contents through an oxygenation cone. In early engineering tests, the sus- pended-bed, floating bead FFB has been run at HRTs of 24, 6, and 4 hours, with -92% removal of soluble carbohydrates and low foam, but biofouling of all surfaces has been a problem. 2001-01-2210. Early results of an integrated water recovery system test. Karen D. Pickering and Kristina R. Wines, NASA John- son Space Center ; Gina M. Pariani, Lea A. Franks, and Jannivine Yeh, Lockheed-Martin Space Operations; Melissa L. Campbell, Hamilton Sunstrand Management Services, Inc.; Barry W. Finger, Honeywell, Inc.; Charles E. Verostko, Liberated Staffing Services ; and Chris Carrier, Jayesh C. Gandhi, and Leticia M. Vega, GB Tech. The work presented in this paper summarizes the early results of an integrated advanced water recovery system test conducted by the Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD) at NASA-Johnson Space Center (JSC). The system design and the results of the first two months of operation are presented. The overall objective of this test is to demonstrate the capability of an integrated advanced water recovery system to produce potable quality water for at least six months. Each subsystem is designed for operation in microgravity. The primary treatment system consists of a biological system for organic carbon and ammonia removal. Dissolved solids are removed by reverse osmosis and air evaporation systems. Finally, ion exchange technology in combination with photolysis or photocata- lysis is used for polishing of the effluent water stream. The waste- water stream consists of urine and urine flush water, hygiene waste- water and a simulated humidity condensate. 281</page><page sequence="281">2001-01-2211-2001-01-2218 2001-01-2211. Integration of composting, plant growth and biofiltration for advanced life support systems. John A. Hogan , Javier C. Ramirez Perez, Weerasak Lertsiriyothin, Peter F. Strom , and Robert M. Cowan , Rutgers , the State University of New Jersey. Composting is a biological solid waste treatment technology with potential use in the management of organic solid wastes generated within advanced life support (ALS) systems, such as planetary bases with extensive plant production. Composting can serve to decrease mass, volume and water content, as well as stabilize and sanitize waste materials. Composting may also serve as a pre-treatment sys- tem prior to aqueous extraction (for nutrient recovery) or incinera- tion. Additionally, the compost produced may serve as a nutrient- rich plant growth substrate. Each of these treatment objectives exerts different compost quality requirements. It is necessary to accurately determine the processing time required for the specified treatment objectives prior to system design and analysis. For exam- ple, waste stabilization will require less processing time than pro- duction of composts suitable for plant growth. This study is designed to provide a time-course characterization of composts generated from the inedible biomass of Advanced Life Support (ALS) candidate crops. Tests utilized for compost charac- terization include a battery of commonly accepted physical/ chemical/biological procedures; aqueous extraction of composts in combination with seed germination testing in extracts; and plant growth (Apogee wheat) on compost samples. These tests will be conducted on material from each sampling period to allow correla- tion analysis of readily determined chemical/physical properties with plant growth. Composting will be conducted in batch mode in a 350 L cylindri- cal reactor. The composting feedstock consists of shredded inedible residues from ALS crops (wheat, soybean, tomato) produced with nutriculture systems, simulated food waste and paper. The con- densed composting exhaust gases are conducted to a biofilter system to evaluate biological treatment for ammonia and VOC removal. Preliminary results and systems design are presented, and the impli- cations of system integration discussed. 2001-01-2214. Design of the thermal control system for the Space Technology 5 Microsatellite. D. Douglas , T. Michalek , and T. Swanson , NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The New Millennium Program's (NMP) Space Technology 5 (ST-5) Project, currently in Phase B of the design process, is slated to launch three 20-kg class spin stabilized microsatellites in late 2003. The proposed orbit is highly elliptical and could result in an earth shadow eclipse of almost 2 hours. Although ST-5 's maximum eclipse is only 2 hours, future missions could involve eclipses as long as 8 hours. As spacecraft size, mass, and available resources decrease and eclipse duration increases, thermal engineers will be challenged to design simple but robust thermal control systems that meet temperature requirements for all phases of the mission. In addi- tion, future similar missions may involve large 'fleets' of such small spacecraft, which, for cost and I&amp;T reasons, must be almost identi- cal in design. Such spacecraft will require a generic but robust ther- mal control design that is suitable for a wide variety of thermal envi- ronments. This paper presents the results of a study of three design concepts and preliminary analysis of the design selected for ST-5. 2001-01-2216. On-orbit thermal performance of RADAR- SAT- 1 spacecraft. G. Wang, D. Nikanpour, and D. Showalter, Canadian Space Agency. The Canadian RAD ARS AT- 1 has successfully served the world as an earth observation satellite since Nov 1995. In this paper, the thermal performance of RAD ARS AT- 1 over the 5 years on orbit (Nov 1995-Nov 2000) has been analyzed through the telemetry tem- perature data. Analysis has been performed for the overall space- craft, the subsystems and some selected units. The thermal control system of the RAD ARS AT- 1 has been examined for cases of both normal orbital conditions and abnormal thermal environments and operations. The TCS has satisfactorily served RADARSAT-1 for a variety of thermal operations. The phenomenon of thermal-optical surface degradation has been directly observed from the thermal data, and varying behavior of surface degradation has been detected. 2001-01-2217. Power down analysis for the Hubble Space Telescope power control unit replacement. Melissa J. Fasold and Jorge L. Piquero, Lockheed Martin Technical Operations ; and John H. Wirzburger, Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. During the fourth servicing mission (SM3B) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Power Control Unit (PCU) will be replaced to correct a fault that has appeared. The PCU controls the power from the solar arrays and the batteries to the entire telescope. The fault reduces the amount of battery power available and could result in a limit being placed on power usage in the future thereby seri- ously reducing science capability. Because all power goes through the PCU, power will be cut off to all HST components for the dura- tion of the change out. Since the maximum Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) duration capability for the Orbiter Astronauts is eight hours, a thermal analy- sis was conducted to evaluate the effect of an eight-hour power off period on the HST components. This analysis was conducted using the HST servicing mission thermal timeline FORTRAN code and the Lockheed Martin proprietary code THERM. While the analysis encompassed the entire vehicle, this paper focuses on the Forward Section of HST, which includes all the equipment bays. This paper presents the results of that analysis and the resulting component preheats developed in order to maintain all components above their minimum turn-on limits for an eight-hour power off period. It describes the preheats developed for the Advanced Com- puter, Communications Equipment (including the Multiple Access Transponder (MAT) and S-Band Single Access Transmitter (SSAT)), Science Instrument Control and Data Handling (SIC&amp;DH), batteries and Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) as well as their corresponding cool downs during power off. 2001-01-2218. Open bay door analysis process for Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 3B. Melissa J. Fasold, Lock- heed Martin Technical Operations. During Servicing Mission 3B (SM3B) for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) the Power Control Unit (PCU) will be replaced. The PCU was not originally designed to be replaced on orbit but was later identified as having the capability of being removed and replaced on orbit. The PCU has many connectors and bolts, some of which are difficult for the astronauts to reach. Due to the added difficulty, the replacement will take an entire six-hour Extra Vehicu- lar Activity (EVA) day. For four of these six EVA hours the door of the Support Systems Module (SSM) Equipment Section (ES) bay where the PCU is found will be open to allow the astronauts access to the PCU and its connectors. This bay, SSM ES Bay 4, also con- tains the four Power Distribution Units (PDUs), which house the busses, switching, fusing, and monitoring circuits that distribute power to the telescope. These PDUs are attached to the bay door and will be seeing a much colder than normal environment with the door open. The PCU controls power for the entire telescope and therefore when it is replaced all power to the telescope will be turned off. With power removed and the bay door open the PDUs will cool rap- idly. In order to be sure that the PDUs remain above their turn-on and operating temperature limits during the change out, a detailed open bay door analysis was conducted. For this analysis a Thermal Synthesizer System (TSS) model was created of Bay 4 and its com- ponents. The model was used to calculate radiation couplings and heat rates with the bay door open. The FORTRAN code used to ana- lyze the Servicing Mission timeline was modified and the new radia- tion couplings and heat rates added. This paper deals with the creation of the detailed TSS model as well as the modifications made to the timeline code in order to run the analysis. It will also present the temperature predictions for the PDUs during the PCU change out. 282</page><page sequence="282">2001-01-2219-2001-01-2226 2001-01-2219. Development of the miniature spacecraft energy retention (MiSER) thermal control panel. Douglas S. Mehoke, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; and Kurt Lankford, Starsys Research . Over the past two years, Starsys and The Johns Hopkins Univer- sity Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) have been working toward the development of a thermal panel that uses a spacecraft's internal power to control its temperature. The panel incorporates two differ- ent thermal technologies: a thermal switch and a high conductivity composite radiator. While thermal switches have been used before, the design and testing costs associated with each new design make them an undesirable alternative. The MiSER panel incorporates a fully tested thermal switch with a radiator into a modular system that can be easily added onto any spacecraft structure. The lightweight radiator makes it self-supporting, so interfaces with the mounting structure are simplified. The same panel can provide thermal control over a wide range of environmental conditions, making constella- tion spacecraft viable with significantly different orbits. The paper discusses the development of the MiSER panel and the analysis and testing done to quantify the performance of the system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2220. Orbital thermal analyses of 'rigidization-on- command' (ROC) materials for inflatable spacecraft. Paul M. McElroy and Robert A. Wise, Technical Alliance Group; and Ron- ald E. Allred, Larry A. Harrah, and Andrea E. Hoyt, Adherent Tech- nologies, Inc. Large space-deployed antennas are of interest in the NASA, mili- tary, and commercial sectors for a variety of applications that include communications, long baseline interferometry, microspa- cecraft, and space-based radar. A need exists for a controlled, clean rigidization technology to harden inflatable spacecraft once they have achieved the required shape. This study addressed the space environment for typical orbits, development of UV curing cationic epoxy resin systems, mechanical properties of UV cured compos- ites, and fabrication of demonstration tubes using the photocurable resin technology. Transient thermal analyses were run on a candi- date tube configuration to determine the power required for internal UV lamps to initiate cure (15.50 W/m2) and the temperature range of the thermal processing windows. A UV-curable cationic epoxy matrix resin formulation was developed for curing at low tempera- tures that exhibits mechanical properties equivalent to those of ther- mally cured epoxy systems. The resin has long-term thermal stabil- ity and low outgassing characteristics. Demonstration tubes were successfully rigidized with exposure to UV light and displayed simi- lar properties to thermally cured tubes of similar construction. When optimized, this Rigidization On Command technology will provide a badly needed technology for the inflatables community. 2001-01-2221. MELFI - The first freezer for science in Space Station. Jean Cheganças, Astrium. Among the different freezers needed for preservation of samples produced in the ISS with the various life science programs (e.g., bio- technology cell science, gravitational biology, ecology, ... ), the Minus Eighty degrees Celsius Laboratory Freezer for the ISS, MELFI, will be the first freezer to be delivered to NASA as Labora- tory Support Equipment (LSE) by the European Space Agency (ESA). From the beginning, the technology for a -80°C freezer was iden- tified as very critical to develop. Throughout the design and devel- opment phases, the different technologies were improved and secured to have a freezer in time for the Space Station Utilization Flights. This paper will start with a system overview, showing the main features of MELFI. The different technical challenges will be then explained and the design choices highlighted. Details on the qualification program will show how those chal- lenges are overcome. 2001-01-2222. MELFI thermal characterization and verifica- tion from subsystem to system. Jean Cheganças, ASTRIUM ; and Virginie Le Gall, EPSILON Ingénierie. The Minus Eighty degrees Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) will be the first freezer to be delivered to NASA as Labo- ratory Support Equipment (LSE) by ESA. Among the MELFI ther- mal requirements, the rapid freezing of samples to a required tem- perature and the low power consumption that limits MELFI perfor- mance during re-cooling phases after power off, are ones of the most critical. This paper will present the thermal activities, which led both to a verification of those requirements and to a complete thermal characterization of MELFI. 2001-01-2223.

This paper will present the results from the bread-boarding phase conducted for the Crew Refrigerator/Freezer Rack project. The Refrigerator/Freezer Racks are designed to supply the International Space Station crew with fresh and frozen food on-board the station and to transport food from ground to the station in the Multi-Purpose Logistic Module (MPLM). 2001-01-2224. Unidirectional active noise attenuation through generalized predictive algorithm. Sohel Anwar, Visteon Corp. Generalized predictive control is a discrete time control strategy that was developed in the late 1980' s by Clark et al. The controller tries to predict the future output of a system or plant and the take control action at present time based on future output error. It is the predictive nature of the controller that is utilized in having an effec- tive noise attenuation in a 1-D noise propagation case (such as a cylindrical enclosure where noise propagates only in one direction). Simulation results are presented for the generalized predictive con- troller (GPC) and then the results are compared against a more tradi- tional controller. 2001-01-2225. Waste and hygiene compartment for the Inter- national Space Station. John E. Feighery and Marybeth Edeen, NASA Johnson Space Center; Karen Meyers, Lockheed Martin; and Paul Dillon, GB Tech. The Waste and Hygiene Compartment will serve as the primary facility for metabolic waste management and personal hygiene on the United States segment of the International Space Station. The Compartment encloses the volume of two standard ISS racks and will be installed into Node 3 after launch inside a Multipurpose Logistics Module on the Space Shuttle. Long-duration space flight requires a departure from the established hygiene and waste disposal practices employed on the Space Shuttle. This paper describes requirements and a conceptual design for the Waste and Hygiene Compartment that are both logistically practical and acceptable to the crew. 2001-01-2226. ISS habitation module interior configuration. David J. Fitts, National Aeronautics and Space Administration/ Johnson Space Center. During 2000, the International Space Station (ISS) Program advanced toward procuring a Habitation (HAB) Module for the ISS. The HAB Module proposed in 2000 was based on reuse of the ISS Program's Boeing Aerospace Corporation structural test article for ISS pressurized modules, outfitted per standard United States On- orbit Segment rack-based architecture. Specifications were negoti- ated throughout the year and two Specification Readiness Reviews (SRR's) were conducted. In the SRR's, a set of habitability func- tions was clearly defined, along with identification of hardware sub- 283</page><page sequence="283">2001-01-2226-2001-01-2231 systems required to fulfill these functional needs. Remaining, how- ever, was identification of a holistic set of ordering principles around which the interior of the HAB Module would be organized. Integration of the interior layout of the HAB Module was addressed as an architectural problem and principles of terrestrial architectural organization brought to bear. There were, however, two realities that led to some surprising results in the interior layout: 1) pre-existing topological features in the test article's primary and secondary structure proved too costly to alter, and 2) user concerns unique to long-duration spaceflight environments were required considerations. The resulting product is perceived by participants in the 2000 HAB topology reviews as the best-fit solution of precondi- tions and challenging constraints to the creation of a space environ- ment unique in the history of spaceflight~a vessel dedicated to pro- viding a non- work living environment to a long-duration spaceflight crew. 2001-01-2227. Space Station biological research project habi- tat: Incubator. G. J. Nakamura and M. Kirv en-Brooks, Lockheed Martin , NASA Ames Research Center ; and N. M. Scheller, NASA Ames Research Center. Developed as part of the suite of Space Station Biological Research Project (SSBRP) hardware to support research aboard the International Space Station (ISS), the Incubator is a temperature- controlled chamber for conducting life science research with small animal, plant and microbial specimens. The Incubator is designed for use only on the ISS and is transported to/from the ISS, unpowered and without specimens, in the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM). The Incubator interfaces with the three SSBRP Host Systems; the Habitat Holding Racks (HHR), the Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG) and the 2.5 m Centrifuge Rotor (CR), providing investigators with the ability to conduct research in microgravity and at variable gravity levels of up to 2-g. The temperature within the Specimen Chamber can be controlled between 4° and 45°C. Cabin air is recirculated within the Specimen Chamber and can be exchanged with the ISS cabin at a rate of =50 cc/min. The humidity of the Specimen Chamber is monitored. The Specimen Chamber has a usable volume of =19 liters and contains two (2) connectors at 28v dc (60W) for science equipment; 5 dedi- cated thermometers for science; ports to support analog and digital signals from experiment unique sensors or other equipment; an Ethernet port; and a video port. It is currently manifested for UF-3 and will be integrated within the first SSBRP Habitat Holding Rack for launch. 2001-01-2228. Considerations in the development of habitats for the support of live rodents on the International Space Sta- tion. Paul S. Espinosa, Joseph T. Bielitzki, and James P. Connolly, NASA Ames Research Center ; and William E. Hinds, Taconic Farms Inc. The animal habitat under development for the International Space Station (ISS) provides a unique opportunity for the physiolog- ical and biological science community to perform controlled experi- ments in microgravity on rats and mice. This paper discusses the complexities that arise in developing a new animal habitat to be flown aboard the ISS. Such development is incremental and moves forward by employing the past successes, learning from experienced shortcomings, and utilizing the latest technologies. The standard vivarium cage on the ground can be a very simple construction, however the habitat required for rodents in microgravity on the ISS is extremely complex. This discussion presents an overview of the system requirements and focuses on the unique scientific and engi- neering considerations in the development of the controlled animal habitat parameters. In addition, the challenges to development, spe- cific science, animal welfare, and engineering issues are covered. The science, engineering, and space operations community will see how difficult it is to meet the complex requirements of the animal habitat system. This information will provide the research commu- nity a better understanding of the rodent habitat which will contrib- ute to enhanced science aboard the ISS. 2001-01-2229. Space life support from the cellular perspec- tive. N. D. Searby and J. Vandendriesche, NASA Ames Research Center ; C. Havens and F. Donovan, Lockheed Martin Engineering &amp; Sciences; J. de Luis, S. Pretorius, and J. Lagaz, Payload Systems Inc.; and L. Sun, L. Kundakovic, C. Preda, I. Berzin, and G. Vunjak- Novakovic, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Determining the fundamental role of gravity in vital biological systems in space is one of six science and research areas that pro- vides the philosophical underpinning for why NASA exists. The study of cells, tissues, and microorganisms in a spaceflight environ- ment holds the promise of answering multiple intriguing questions about how gravity affects living systems. To enable these studies, specimens must be maintained in an environment similar to that used in a laboratory. Cell culture studies under normal laboratory conditions involve maintaining a highly specialized environment with the necessary temperature, humidity control, nutrient, and gas exchange conditions. These same cell life support conditions must be provided by the International Space Station (ISS) Cell Culture Unit (CCU) in the unique environment of space. The CCU is a per- fusion-based system that must function in microgravity, at unit grav- ity (lg) on earth, and from 0.1 g up to 2g aboard the ISS centrifuge rotor. One of the biggest challenges is to optimize the flow environ- ment within the cell specimen chamber to meet the complex and often conflicting requirements to provide uniform gas and nutrient exchange, to maintain cell suspension, and to control hydrodynamic stresses acting on the adherent or suspended cells. Other challenges include obtaining representative samples of cells and culture medium, managing any bubbles formed in the cell specimen cham- ber and fluid lines, preventing blockage of the cell separation mem- brane inside the chamber, and providing sterile containment during all experiment phases. Flight studies of cells and tissues also require the development of proper control experiments for specific parame- ters in the cell culture environment. Thorough ground testing is cur- rently being carried out in development hardware called the Science Evaluation Units. We present data from our experiments using ani- mal, plant, and microbial cells where we have optimized these life support conditions. 2001-01-2230. Plant Research Unit - Program overview. Thomas M. Crabb, Robert C. Morrow, and Jon G. Frank, Orbital Technologies Corp. The Plant Research Unit development effort will provide a high- performance and highly versatile, controlled environment plant growth chamber for space-based variable gravity science and bio- technology investigations on the International Space Station. Tem- perature, humidity, atmospheric composition, lighting, and nutrient delivery are the critical parameters to control in an automated and reliable way. Access to plant material on-orbit and maintenance of the unit with minimal crew effort are other major requirements, as is a modular design allowing easy subsystem/technology change- outs so that science capability and maintainability are maximized. The Plant Research Unit (PRU) development program is based on the results of the Biomass Production System (BPS) and many other technical developments, and uses the BPS as a risk mitigation prototype for the PRU. Taking advantage of the significant team experience and learning gained in developing the BPS, several inno- vative improvements to plant growth chamber and environmental control design have been incorporated into the PRU. 2001-01-2231. Science accommodations in the biomass pro- duction system. Robert C. Morrow, Thomas M. Crabb, Jeffery T. Iverson, and J. G. Frank, Orbital Technologies Corp. The Biomass Production System (BPS) is a double middeck locker payload designed to fly on the Orbiter or Space Station. The BPS contains four plant growth chambers (PGCs) with independent control of temperature, humidity, lighting, CO2, and nutrient solu- 284</page><page sequence="284">200 1 -0 1 -223 1-200 1 -0 1 -2236 tion delivery, allowing for multiple experimental treatments. The BPS provides several features to support on-orbit science activities including the ability to downlink system and science data, video cameras with framegrab capability to collect images for recording plant development, access to plants to perform activities such as pol- lination or tissue sampling, and gas and fluid sampling ports for sampling of the plant environment. Other capabilities include the ability to conduct CO2 drawdowns, allowing photosynthetic mea- surements, and the ability to meter plant CO2 and water use. Several technology developments have been evaluated for possible imple- mentation during future upgrades to enhance science capabilities. 2001-01-2232. Experimental protocol design for The Interna- tional Space Station Insect Habitat. Tony L Parkes , University of Guelph and Canadian Space Agency. The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, is an ideal organism for biological research for several reasons: it is small and relatively sim- ple to culture, has a short generation time, and can be grown in num- bers large enough to permit meaningful statistical analysis. Its genetics are well understood and easily manipulated, and a vast stock of mutant and engineered strains exist which facilitate the molecular analysis of almost any biological question. In fact, much of what we currently understand about the basic mechanisms under- lying metabolism, development, reproduction, behavior, and aging is derived directly from Drosophila research. For all of these rea- sons, Drosophila is a logical choice on which to perform basic research into the effects of the spaceflight environment on living systems. The Space Station Insect Habitat is being developed by the Canadian Space Agency in support of this effort. This paper will dis- cuss the challenges encountered in producing a self-contained Insect Habitat capable of not only supporting the growth and development of several generations of Drosophila, but also facilitating the extrac- tion of useful scientific data from sometimes complicated experi- mental protocols performed with limited crew interaction. One such protocol will be described in detail, illustrating how these logistical problems have been solved, and indicating the sorts of data obtain- able in the Habitat and its value to the scientific community. 2001-01-2233. Insect habitat hardware. Julie Bourdeau and Louis Piché , Routes AstroEngineering (RAE). The International Space Station's (ISS) Gravitational Biology Facility includes facilities to support cell cultures, rodents, plants, aquatic species, eggs and insects. The Insect Habitat (IH AB) is being provided by the Canadian Space Agency to support the Gravi- tational Biology Facility. The IHAB will initially support the fruit- fly, Drosophila melangaster, but is also designed to hold a variety of other insect species. IHAB 's hardware consists of three elements: the Science Element (SE), the Transport Element (TE), and the Con- tainer Element (CE). One of the SE' s unique features is its capability to provide two independent levels of simulated gravity from the ISS ambient grav- ity level to 2g. Therefore, the IHAB allows for an in-space control group, while the other group is exposed to micro-gravity (or any other allowable gravity level). The biological environment also includes control for illumination, video, temperature and relative humidity. The TE is responsible for the specimen's life support during the transport of the specimens between the ground and ISS. The TE con- trols the same environmental parameters as the SE, minus the video and the gravitational simulation. The CE is responsible for the speci- men containment and providing the food to the insects. 2001-01-2234. Experimental study on periodical fluctuations of the diffuse vapor/gas front during operation of a gas-loaded heat pipe. Andreas Edom , OHB-System GmbH; and Valeri V. Vlas- sov, INPE - National Institute for Space Research. A test sequence with two gas-loaded heat pipes of different geometry with external noncondensable gas reservoirs was per- formed in order to detect, analyze and classify conjugated and detached fluctuations of evaporator temperature, operating tempera- ture and the position of the vapor/gas front after start-up. The fluctu- ations become noticeable at operation with more than half of the condenser open and gain force the more the front approaches the condenser end. It was found that amplitude, frequency and polarity of the fluctuations also depend on the magnitude of a heat load step change, the gas charge and the working fluid. A method is men- tioned of how to dampen the fluctuations. 2001-01-2235. Investigation of transient temperature oscilla- tions of a propylene loop heat pipe. José I.

A technology demonstration propylene Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) has been tested extensively in support of the implementation of this two-phase thermal control technology on NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instru- ment. This cryogenic instrument is being developed at the Jet Pro- pulsion Laboratory (JPL) for NASA. This paper reports on the tran- sient characterization testing results showing low frequency temper- ature oscillations. Steady-state performance and model correlation results can be found elsewhere. Results for transient startup and shutdown are also reported elsewhere. In space applications, when LHPs are used for thermal control, the power dissipation components are typically of large mass and may operate over a wide range of power dissipations; there is a con- cern that the LHP evaporator may see temperature oscillations at low powers and over some temperature range. In addition, the LHP may not start when power is applied to the component until a signifi- cant temperature overshoot from the equilibrium temperature is developed. In most space applications, the temperature oscillation will pose a problem because the maximum allowable flight tempera- tures (AFTs) may be exceeded and the long-term reliability of equipment is compromised. When equipment temperature stability is important, this becomes a serious issue. Its important to under- stand the LHP behavior in such a situation in order to mitigate potential problems and design predictable two-phase thermal con- trol systems. A test program was developed at JPL to characterize the transient behavior of a propylene LHP with a large mass attached to the evap- orator and at low powers and low sink temperatures. The LHP was tested in a horizontal orientation with heat loads ranging from 15 to 75 watts and condenser temperatures from -30°C to 0°C. In addi- tion, a small heater and temperature sensor were placed on the LHP compensation chamber to provide close loop temperature control and was tested under similar conditions. Transient results show repeatable low frequency temperature oscillations for a range of conditions. When temperature control is applied to the compensa- tion chamber, the evaporator temperature oscillations disappear. Recommendations are made for additional research on this topic. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2236. Investigation results of axial grooved heat pipes with high thermal capacity. V. Barantsevich , K. Goncharov, A. OrloVy and O. Golovin , Lavochkin Association. Experimental investigation results of developed Axial Heat Pipes with Q-shape grooves ('Re-Entrant' grooved geometry) are pres- ented in this paper.

Research on axially grooved heat pipe heat transfer characteristics in ground tests. V. Baturkin and D. Ole - firenko , National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Polytech- nic Institute Axially grooved heat pipes (HP) are traditional and verified com- ponents of space thermal control systems. Their elaboration and study during the last 30 years give numerous information about inner heat transfer processes. Nevertheless, the different approaches, methods and assumptions used by researches do not allow to con- duct reliable comparison of results and to apply the obtained results to new developed heat pipes designs. Therefore full description of heat transfer research results and analysis of reasons affecting on them is still actual and important. Ground tests of axially grooved heat pipes have specific features associated with influence of gravity on heat pipe performance and heat transfer, influence of attached accompanied elements as heat- ers, condensers, sensors, insulation. These factors can influence thereby that resulting characteristics as heat transfer coefficients, thermal resistance, heat productivity will be not evident enough and reliable. Task of the current paper is to investigate the influence of announced factors both theoretically and by experiments. The typi- cal modeling object is an ammonia aluminum grooved heat pipe by shell diameter 12 mm and 30 grooves. 2001-01-2238. Wick characterization by image analysis. Eduardo G. Reimbrecht , Paulo César Philippi, and Edson Bazzo, Federal University of Santa Catarina. The microstructure characterization of tubular wicks is discussed using an image analysis method, mercury intrusion porosimetry and Arquimedes method. The central objective of this work is to deter- mine the wide convenience of the image analysis technique for wick characterization. It is demonstrate that the image analysis technique is an appropriate tool to determine correlation function, total poros- ity and pore size distribution in two-dimensional (2-D) binary images of microstructures. The correlation function is used to simu- late the 3-D reconstruction of porous structure. The images were obtained from a set of wick samples made of sintered nickel, through scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). A computer pro- gram (Imago) was developed and used in the work. The mercury intrusion porosimetry is also used to provide information about the breakthrough diameter of porous material. Results show porosity of about 60% and effective pore size less than 4 ļim. 2001-01-2239. Mathematical modeling for predicting steady state and transient characteristics of reservoir embedded looped heat pipe (RELHP). Tetsurou Ogushi, Seiji Haga , Hiroaki Ishikawa , and Akira Yao , MELCO; and Akihiro Miyasaka, and Hiroyuki Nöda, NASDA. This paper presents the heat transfer characteristics of a Reser- voir Embedded Looped Heat Pipe (RELHP) with stainless steel porous wick with pore diameter of 1pm and working fluid of ammo- nia. The core of evaporator is used as a liquid reservoir to enhance operational reliability. Mathematical models for predicting static and transient heat transfer characteristics of RELHP were devel- oped. Evaporative heat transfer coefficient in wick and heat transfer between vapor phase and liquid puddle in reservoir are taken into consideration in these models. Experiments using the reservoir visual inspection model and practical RELHP were conducted and compared with the prediction. The evaporator of the practical model has the length of 1000 mm and diameter of 38 mm and the total loop length is 11.5 m. The practical RELHP model has the same configu- ration, as that will be experimented in ETS-VIII. Natural convection but nucleate boiling was observed in the liquid puddle in the reser- voir of the visual inspection model. The practical RELHP model showed larger heat transport capacity than specified 1 kW. The steady state and transient simulations of RELHP approximated to the experimental results. 2001-01-2240. Pulsating and oscillating heat transfer devices in acceleration environments from microgravity to super- gravity. A. A. M. Delil, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR. The work described was done during a five months stay as visit- ing professor at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, in Sagamihara, Japan. The research concentrates on pulsating and oscillating heat transfer devices, being of interest for applications in spacecraft thermal control in microgravity, in planetary partial grav- ity and hypergravity environment, and hypergravity acceleration levels in rotating spacecraft. Different aspects of various heat trans- fer devices in gravity environments ranging from microgravity to supergravity are discussed. An overview is given of worldwide activities on and the state of the art of pulsating and oscillating heat transfer devices, in an attempt to assess commonalties and differ- ences. Following the outcomes of this assessment, a baseline philos- ophy for modeling and for comparison of experimental data was defined, in order to anticipate an easy comparison with the results of ongoing and future research activities. In addition a versatile test set-up was defined and developed such that it allows the variation of almost all the relevant parameters. The latter parameters are: Working fluid and fill charge, power, transport length, inclination with respect to the gravity vector, and the possi- bility to choose either the dead-end pulsating or the closed-loop oscillating configuration. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2242. Thermal balance testing of the Envisat pay- load module. S. G. Price and P. J. Argles, Astrium UK; M. Manns, Astrium GmbH; and B. Pieper, European Space Agency. The Envisat spacecraft has a launch mass greater than 8.0 tons and external dimensions of 10.0 meters x 2.8 meters x 2.1 meters. Due to its large size, it was necessary to perform the thermal balance and thermal vacuum testing in two stages. Firstly, there was the test- ing of the Service Module and, secondly, the testing of the Payload Module (PLM). This paper discusses the thermal balance testing of the PLM. The PLM, itself, is 7.5 meters tall; too large to fit into a test facility solar beam. Originally, it was intended to conduct two solar beam tests; one for the upper part and the second for the lower part. Following a revision and re-scheduling within the program, it was decided to perform a single, non-solar beam, thermal balance test. The thermal balance test would be performed using test specific, electrical, heat- ers and test facility shroud control. The Envisat PLM supports a complement of 10 earth observation instruments and was successfully tested in July/August 1999 at the Large Space Simulator (LSS), at ESTEC, The Netherlands. The objectives of the thermal balance test were to provide correlation data for the thermal mathematical models and to demonstrate the Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS) performance. Test data, taken from the test, is compared with the test predictions and a correlation performed. The resultant thermal model will be utilized to provide the final flight predictions. The paper outlines the rationale behind the selection and defini- tion of the test, discusses technical aspects of the test set-up and shows the achieved, thermal mathematical model, correlation. 2001-01-2243. Thermal model of an IR-radiator and calcula- tion of the radiation field. H. U. Frey, Industrieanlagen - Betriebs- gesellschaft mbH (IABG). A thermal model of an IR-radiator with 1000 W nominal power and about 300 mm length is developed. Using the thermal software ES ARAD and ES ATAN the radiation field of one or an arrangement of a set of IR radiators is calculated quantitatively. This thermal model of the IR radiator arrangement can be integrated as part of the thermal model of the test article or the test set-up. Defined test runs can be simulated and the thermal behavior can be predicted. The theoretically defined radiation field of a volume of 2 m x 2 m x 1 m was compared with a measured field of an IR radiator. There is a good agreement between the calculated and the measured 286</page><page sequence="286">200 1 -0 1 -2243-200 1 -0 1 -2249 values. Differences are in the range of 1% to 2.5% for the standard deviation. The 3-dimensional radiation field is stored in equidistant steps in a matrix. This matrix is the basis of a superpositioning program which allows to calculate the radiation field of defined fields of IR radiators. The irradiance distribution of defined test planes can be predicted in absolute or relative values. For each IR radiator the ori- gin co-ordinates, the direction of the filament and the direction of the reflector must be defined. Examples for IR radiator arrangements and resulting irradiance distribution in the target plane are presented. An optimization for the arrangement of the IR radiators in a plane for illuminating plane surfaces of test articles, for example solar panels, is performed. The best results are obtained if the distance of the IR radiators in filament direction is 30 mm to 50 mm and perpen- dicular to the filament the rows are arranged in a distance of 250 mm to 300 mm. 2001-01-2244. MPLM total off-gassing test through different sampling methods: Comparison and experimental results. Pier Michele Bertignono, Cesare Lobascio , Michele Crivello , and Ric- cardo Rampini, Alenia Spazio S.p.A. The Total Off-gassing test purpose is to determine the identity and quantity of trace gas contaminants off-gassed in areas of space- craft where the crew will breathe the atmosphere. Two different air sampling methods were adopted in parallel dur- ing the off-gassing tests on the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules (MPLM) by Alenia Spazio. The first method, based on NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) requirements, foresees storage of collected air samples into stainless steel pressure cylinders. The second method proposed by ESA (European Space Agency), uses trace con- taminants adsorption on Carbopack™-filled ceramic tubes. Sample lines route the samples collected inside the MPLM cabin, to the respective external collection points. Successively, the stored samples are chemically analyzed by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques and the module off-gassing rates are calculated. Purpose of this paper is to provide evidence of the obtained experimental results comparing the two test methods used. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2245.

P. Gupta, and H. Narayanamurthy, Thermal Systems Group; and A. D. Dharma, Integration and Power Area. A computer-based data acquisition and power control system has been designed and installed for conducting thermal test at 4M ther- mal vacuum chamber of ISRO Satellite Center (ISAC), Bangalore, INDIA. The system consists of four main units viz. Temperature Signal Processing Unit(TSPU), Power and Control Unit(PACU), Spacecraft telemetry and thermal vacuum chamber facility data interface unit and Data Processing Unit (DPU). The system has capability of monitoring 512 thermocouple channels, 700 spacecraft telemetry thermal-related parameters, facility parameters including chamber vacuum level, chamber contamination level using Quartz Crystal Monitor data and 128 numbers of heat-flux/temperature control channels. TSPU and PACU are VME-based systems. DPU is based on Pentium processor with hot redundancy using Redun- dant Array Of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) to takeover in case of fail- ure of a server. All the subsystems and their peripherals are net- worked using TCP/IP on Ethernet. Details of the system configura- tion, its specification and performance are presented here. 2001-01-2246. E-BEAM treatment of organically contami- nated water. Piotr Lubicki, Friedemann Freund, and Marc Tan, Phytron Instruments, Inc. Energetic electrons injected into water abundantly create short- lived radicals that initiate rapid reactions. This leads to the break-up of organic contaminants into harmless products. The process works without catalyst (or other consumables) at ambient temperature and pressure. It is highly energy-efficient. We discuss preliminary results concerning removal of trichloro-ethylene, chloroform, ben- zene, and toluene using an electron beam (E-BEAM) system. On the basis of these results, we review the development of a compact E-BEAM system that can be used in space inhabitation and long- term space travel. Portability is achieved by using a relatively low beam energy, -250 keV. We discuss newly available electron trans- parent windows, the development of a high-efficiency accelerator and power supply that control the power consumption to a level acceptable by NASA standards. 2001-01-2247. Activation of the processes of scavenging in the revitalization water systems using electrochemical principles. Nadezhda S. Demidova and Alexander V. Bochkov, Moscow Avia- tion Institute. One of the vital issues being solved at development of self- contained ecosystems (of space stations, ground-level and underwa- ter complexes) to provide the crew with the water from products of habitability. To solve this problem the revitalization water systems, using electrochemical principles, servicing module of 3 persons and capa- ble of independent operation during 3 months, have been designed. The results of the mass exchange research are summarized by way of driving forces activity ratio that takes into account a variable input impurity concentration, as well as the ratio of phasal interac- tion that relates to the speed of inflow and of the electric current. Given below are the ways offered to activate the processes of removing impurities from water: - by creation of variable electric field ensuring the interaction between OH" ions and eliminated com- ponents in the field of maximum current, - by sectioning the welding rod with different current density and separation of the areas of the fallout of bound ions with appropriate solubility product. The above ways allow to reduce the power consumption of the system by 20%. This is the survey of a general mathematical model of the revital- ization water systems using electrochemical principles and includ- ing differential equations of the mass exchange, momentum and temperature. 2001-01-2248. Design optimization of cascade rotary distiller with the heat pump for water reclamation from urine. V. Riferì, V. Usenko, and I. Zolotukhin, Thermodistillation; and A. MacK- night, and A. Lubman, Honeywell International Inc. Vacuum rotary distillation is an attractive technology for water recovery from wastewater onboard a human-crewed spacecraft that includes human urine and reverse osmosis brine. To reduce specific energy consumption while purifying water in the vacuum rotary dis- tillation technology, multistage distillations, as well as thermoelec- tric heat pumps, are used. A theoretical approach to the calculation of the optimal number of distillation stages is given. Test results are given for a new five-stage cascaded distiller in a system with a ther- moelectric heat pump. These results include the performance param- eters of the system and the water quality of the product for the pro- cess of water recovery from solutions of NaCl and human urine. 2001-01-2249. Design and construction of a pilot scale system to remove pollutants from an incinerator effluent. D. T. Wick- ham, J. A. Bahr, M. Dubovik, S. C. Gebhard, and J. Lind, TDA Research, Inc. Incineration is a promising method for converting biomass and human waste into CO2 and H2O during extended planetary explora- tion. However, incineration produces small amounts of NOx and SO2 in the effluent, which must be removed. TDA Research has developed a safe and effective process to remove NOx and SO2 from waste incinerator product gas streams. In our process, NO is catalyt- 287</page><page sequence="287">2001-01-2249-2001-01-2256 ically oxidized to NO2, using a low-temperature oxidation catalyst developed at TDA. Wet scrubbers then remove the NO2, with most of the NO2 converted into an aqueous solution that can be used as a plant nutrient. A packed bed containing a basic sorbent, also devel- oped at TDA, removes SO2 from the effluent. As part of an SBIR Phase II project, TDA designed and con- structed a pilot scale effluent cleaning system, which will be used with the incinerator at NASA Ames Research Center. In addition to NOx and SO2, the system is designed to remove other pollutants found in the effluent, including fly ash and unburned hydrocarbons. The apparatus constructed at TDA consists of a cyclone separator and filter for fly ash removal, a solid sorbent bed for SO2 control, two catalyst beds for oxidation of NO, CO, and unburned hydrocar- bons, two wet scrubbers to remove NO2, heat exchangers for ther- mal management, and instrumentation for process control. In this paper, we will present detailed data that was used to design the full- scale NO oxidation reactor along with the NO2 scrubbers. Our pro- cess for NOx control is simpler than the competing technology and is therefore attractive for NOx control for natural gas fired turbines and other stationary NOx sources. 2001-01-2251. Two-parameter equations of state for ARPCS applications. Richard R. Chu , Lockheed Martin Space Operations. This work summarizes the limitations of the Ideal Gas Law and the use of simple but accurate two-parameter equations of state for air, oxygen, and nitrogen in the operations of ECLS/EVA hardware. The equation-of-state parameters can be determined for pure gases and for mixtures by mixture combination rules. The parameters of two equations of state in Redlich-Kwong equation of state and Peng- Robinson equation of state have been calculated here. Technical evaluations for spacecraft applications and relevant ranges in tem- peratures and pressures have been performed. The equations are applicable for several ECLS subsystems: Temperature and Humid- ity Control, THC; Atmospheric Revitalization System, ARS; and Atmospheric Control System, ACS. The goal is to focus on equa- tions of state for ECLS/EVA applications, especially in depress/ repress/compression of air and gases. The purpose of this paper is to enlighten and empower our scientists and engineers with an accu- rate but simple tool in lieu of actual data of air and gas properties. 2001-01-2252. ARPCS2AT2_Station: A tool for atmospheric pressure and composition control analysis. Sharon A. Lafuse , NASA Johnson Space Center ; and Richard R. Chu , Lockheed Martin Space Operations. A generalized computer program for analysis of pressure and composition in multiple volume systems has been under develop- ment by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) since 1976. This paper describes the most recent develop- ments in the program. These improvements include the addition of an X-windows style graphical user interface (GUI), the inclusion of simulations of International Space Station (ISS) Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) components, the addi- tion of simulation of Shuttle space suits, the addition of an event processor, and the addition of an option for the user to select the vol- ume configuration. The ARPCS2AT2_STATION computer program was developed by NASA as a tool for analyzing the changes in partial pressures of four gasses (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor) in interconnected volumes. The current version allows two volume configurations: four volumes in a line, one central volume with four other volumes attached to it. The graphical user interface lets the user select the volume configuration, select which ECLSS compo- nents are operating, set initial conditions, create an event list, run the program and look at results in graphs and tabular form. This paper will describe how the program can be used to support ISS missions by showing how it was used to support the Flight 2A. 2B/STS -106. 2001-01-2253. Integrated air revitalization system perfor- mance analysis for the ISS assembly missions #2A.2b and #3A. Ching-Fen Ts ai, Boeing Co. Integrated Orbiter and International Space Station (ISS) air revi- talization system performance analysis/assessment is a vital task to support the ISS assembly missions. A multi-element fixed control volume integrated air revitalization system performance computer model has been developed and upgraded for the evaluation of atmo- spheric characteristics inside each habitable compartments of the Orbiter and ISS. The results from this computer model were utilized to assess the interchange airflow capabilities, and to evaluate integrated air revi- talization system operation limitations and requirements. Results from this performance analysis were also used to predict possible integrated air revitalization system operating constraints, such as interchange airflow rates and occupancy limitations in each module, during the ISS assembly missions. Two ISS assembly missions #2 A. 2b and #3 A post-flight data were obtained for the validation of computer model results. Com- parison of analysis results and post-flight data is presented in this paper to show that this model can provide an acceptable and reason- able atmosphere analysis and evaluation for assessing all the habit- able compartments inside the integrated Orbiter/ISS. 2001-01-2254. Pre-flight analysis and post-flight assessment of ISS mission 2R. Phillip E. Bellmore , Boeing Space &amp; Communi- cations Group. A SINDA/FLUINT analysis of the 2R mission will be presented. The analysis will predict the air temperature, humidity, oxygen, and carbon-dioxide levels associated with initial permanent habitation of the International Space Station. The Expedition 1 crew will assemble several key Environmental Control and Life Support sys- tem components; namely the Vozdukh, Elektron, and Service Mod- ule air conditioner. The pre-flight analysis will be compared to actual flight data to validate assumptions and fidelity of the SINDA/ FLUINT model. Differences will be evaluated to determine the cause, whether due to modeling deficiencies or invalid assumptions regarding timelined activities. 2001-01-2255. CFD simulation on the airflow and CO2 trans- port in the U.S Lab: International Space Station Flight 5 A con- figuration. Chao-Hsin Lin and Chang H. Son , Boeing Co. The U. S. Laboratory (USL) module was added to the Interna- tional Space Station (ISS) in Flight 5A, which would boost the Envi- ronmental Control &amp; Life Support System (ECLSS) functional capabilities of the ISS. In the USL cabin aisle way, the air circula- tion is provided by a Temperature &amp; Humidity Control (THC) sys- tem. To provide adequate ventilation under various open/close com- binations of the rack panels, it would be very challenging by con- ducting many tests prior to the launch of Flight 5A. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation technology is utilized to investi- gate the airflow in the U.S. Lab for various operating scenarios. A CFD model, which includes the supply diffusers, the return regis- ters, the ventilation of the temporary crew quarter, the gap between the outer pressure shell and all the racks, is modeled. The ventilation performance for the cabin aisle way and air behind panels is addressed. The concern over the potential accumulation of CO2 in certain regions, where the airflow becomes stagnant, is also addressed by simulating the transient transport of CO2 in this study. 2001-01-2256. The effect of gravity-induced buoyancy on velocity measurement in 1-g environment. Chang H. Son and Chao-Hsin Lin , Boeing Co. The effects of testing cabin ventilation in gravity to meet a requirement for ventilation on orbit were analyzed. Buoyancy is due to the combined presence of a density gradient within the fluid and a body force that is proportional to the fluid density. Since gravity cannot be removed, the test must be conducted with air at as near to constant density as practical in order to remove buoyancy effects. 288</page><page sequence="288">2001-01-2256-2001-01-2261 The effects of gravity-induced buoyancy force on the velocity field was analyzed by the Richardson number. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to verify the theoretical methods. The velocity data for a 1-g and a no gravity case were compared. The ratio between local velocity and free stream velocity, u/U-infinity were analyzed for the dimensionless parameter, rj (= y V U-infinity/vx). There is a relatively sharp rise in the profile near the wall and an overshoot of the velocity beyond its free stream value. For the range of average velocity in the International Space Station (ISS) module, the buoyancy effect is only significant inside the boundary layer or close to the wall surface. This fact showed that the effect of buoyancy on the overall cabin ventilation velocity is minimal for distances greater than 6 inches from the wall. Test con- ditions to avoid gravity effects on the velocity measurements were suggested. 2001-01-2257. Testing method to determine the thermal par- asitics of the NICMOS cryogenic cooler. Christine Cottingham, Lockheed Martin; Mark V. Zagarola, Creare Inc.; David C. Bugby , Swales Aerospace; and Anne Marie Russell , Global Science and Technology. The NICMOS Cryogenic Cooler (NCC) is a turbomachine-based reverse-Brayton cycle cryocooler combined with a single-phase cryogenic heat transport loop. The NCC will be installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on a future servicing mission, and will provide refrigeration to the Near Infrared Camera and Multi- Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) detectors that were previously cooled by a dewar of sublimating solid nitrogen. The NCC is designed to remove a total of 7 W of heat and maintain the NICMOS detectors at 77 K. The 7 W heat load is comprised of the dissipation from the NICMOS detectors and the parasitic s into the heat trans- port loop. During testing of the NCC it was crucial to quantify parasitic heat loads in the heat transport loop since this governs the minimum temperature that can be achieved at the NICMOS detectors. The determination of parasitics was aided by the installation of a well- instrumented section of tubing, referred to as a shunt, that connected the inlet and outlet heat transport lines of the NCC. This shunt and its instrumentation were thermally isolated from the NCC environ- ment so as not to introduce any additional parasitics. Using this shunt, we were able to determine the mass flow rate of the neon cooling gas and the distribution of parasitics throughout the heat transport loop of the NCC. The value of the method developed herein is twofold: (1) it pro- vided a means to reliably quantify the cooling capability of the two- loop NCC; and (2) it provided a means to quantitatively evaluate modifications to the NCC to lower NICMOS detector temperature for better detector performance. 2001-01-2258. Thermal design and analysis of the NICMOS cooling system for the Hubble Space Telescope. Ten H. Gregory , Jackson and Tuli Aerospace Engineering Division; and William I. Clement , Clement Engineering , Inc. The Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NIC- MOS) was installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during the HST's Second Servicing Mission (SM-2) in February 1997. Shortly after installation, a thermal short was discovered inside the cryogenic dewar designed to cool the instrument's detectors. This thermal short introduced a significantly higher parasitic heat load into the solid nitrogen cryogen than predicted and reduced the expected scientific life of NICMOS from approximately 4.8 years to approximately 2.5 years. The NICMOS Cooling System (NCS) has been designed to restore NICMOS science capabilities by cooling the detectors utiliz- ing a closed loop mechanical cryocooler. The NICMOS Cryocooler (NCC) will deliver neon at cryogenic temperatures to the NICMOS dewar through tubing which was originally designed to subcool the dewar on the ground prior to launch. The NCS will be installed onto NICMOS as an extra- vehicular activity during the fourth HST Ser- vicing Mission, designated SM-3B, scheduled for launch in Novem- ber 2001. This paper describes the thermal design of the NICMOS Cooling System as well as the thermal analyses performed in conjunction with the design and in support of on orbit control of the cooling system. 2001-01-2259. Thermal study of laser interferometer space antenna (Lisa). Lutz Morgenroth , CASE GmbH; Karl Honnen, Astrium GmbH; and Sam Heys and David Hayoun, RAL. The objective of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is the detection of low-frequency gravitational waves. The fluctuation of the distance of test masses inside 3 spacecraft's which are located 5*106 km apart is measured with an accuracy of 10"12 m to achieve this. This requires very stringent temperature stability. Variations of solar constant, dissipation and the response to switch- ing/mode changes cause temperature fluctuations that have to be suppressed. The spacecraft thermal design relies on a solar array as a sun shield with good thermal de-coupling between the solar cells and the structure and rejection of heat from the electronics directly to space. MLI is avoided because of its potentially unstable insulation proper- ties. Transient analyses were performed with a temperature accuracy of 10 8 K. It was found that the fluctuations caused by the solar cons- tant are sufficiently damped. Correlated electronic unit dissipations within the pay load must be stable within about 0.2%. Mode changes of bus units may not change dissipation by more than 0.5 W. 2001-01-2260. Fine temperature control of coupled fluid- looped radiators operating under differently varying sink condi- tions. Masao Furukawa, NASDA, Tsukuba Space Center. Thermal/hydraulic analyses are made for optimal design and in- orbit operations of a fluid-looped two-radiator system, which could be used for tighter temperature control of a thermoelectrically cooled mission equipment. Analysis results are mathematically rear- ranged to construct a plain algorithm suited to design calculations. Computations upon that algorithm provide us with several groups of curves applicable to preliminary design of fluid loops with seri- ally connected radiators. All such curves are actually used in reason- ably determining design specifications of an ammonia/propylene- based cooling loop of our concern. A simplified solution method is then introduced for off-design operations problems to readily find the resulting heat rejection, the required pumping power, the required pump speed, the resulting temperature drop, the resulting cold plate temperature, and so on. Solutions under various sink con- ditions, ranging from the coldest to the hottest, are graphically shown in the figures. A cascade controller, consisting of a state pre- dictor and a proportional-integral regulator, is proposed for pump speed modulation met to varying orbital heat inputs. The steady-state solutions are compiled as a computational basis of the predictor. Linearized governing equations Laplace- transformed to yield a transfer function, which is reduced to an exponentially modified fractional expression. The lag time and the dead time characterizing that expression are displayed in the figures, from which one may easily derive a suitable set of the proportional gain and the reset time of the regulator. 2001-01-2261. One-year operations of the MITA mini-satellite - Validation of the thermal design from on-orbit data. M. Molina , T. Lupi , and G. Annoni , Carlo Gavazzi Space SpA; and V.

Its demonstration mission was launched the 15th July 2000 from Plesetsk by means of a COSMOS rocket. According to the technological qualification goal of the mission, it was possible to use the spacecraft operations for the thermal design performance characterization; so doing several measurements were available as correlation points with the thermal model.

In particular, precious data were collected in order to reduce the modeling uncertainties in the MITA satellite's family, whose first commercial mission is scheduled for 2003, carrying a gamma- ray telescope. In its first mission, the MITA platform was carrying a particle detector called NINA, contained in a pressurized vessel. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2262. Thermal design and on-orbit performance of the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer. José I. Rodriguez and David J. Diner, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument was launched aboard NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra spacecraft on December 18, 1999. The overall mission design life- time for the instrument is 6 years. The EOS Terra spacecraft was placed in a sun-synchronous near-circular polar orbit with an incli- nation of 98.3 degrees and a mean altitude of 705 km. The overall objective of MISR is to provide a means to study the ecology and climate of earth through the acquisition of global multiangle imag- ery on the daylit side of earth. MISR views the sunlit earth simulta- neously at nine widely spaced angles, collects global images with high spatial detail in four colors at every angle. The images acquired, once calibrated, provide accurate measurements of bright- ness, contrast and color of reflected sunlight. Changes in the reflec- tion at different view angles provides a means to distinguish between different types of atmospheric particles (aerosols), cloud forms and land surface covers. Using stereoscopic techniques, MISR data enables construction of 3 -dimensional models and more accurate estimates of the total amount of sunlight reflected by Earth's diverse environments. The thermal design provides three temperature zones required by the instrument, namely -5°C, 5°C and 20°C. The charged-couple device (CCD) detectors are cooled by solid state single-stage ther- moelectric coolers (TECs) which dump their waste heat to nadir radiators. Nadir radiators provide cooling for the optical bench and all nine cameras with camera head electronics. The remaining elec- tronics are cooled to ambient temperatures near 20° C with separate nadir radiators. The thermal control system (TCS) consists of passive and active elements to maintain the instrument within allowable flight temper- ature limits (AFTs). Passive thermal control includes multi-layer insulation (MLI) blankets, thermal straps, and surface coatings to manage the transfer of waste energy from sources through structures and ultimately to nadir radiators. Active thermal control employs TECs and close-loop heater control systems for the detectors and optical bench. Operational and replacement heaters are used in the instrument science and safe modes and survival heaters are used in the survival mode. This paper describes the instrument thermal requirements, thermal design, key drivers for the design process and analysis results. The on-orbit performance to date is also presented. 2001-01-2263. System accommodation of propylene loop heat pipes for the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instru- ment. Eric W. Grob, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Loop Heat Pipes are used for precise temperature control for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) Instrument in a widely varying LEO thermal envi- ronment. Two propylene LHPs are utilized to provide separate ther- mal control for the Nd:YAG Lasers and the remaining avionics/ detector components suite. Despite a rigorous engineering development and test plan to demonstrate the performance in the restrictive GLAS design, the flight units failed initial thermal vacuum acceptance testing at GSFC. Subsequent investigation revealed that compromises in the mechanical packaging of these systems resulted in inadequate charge levels for a concentric wick LHP. The redesign effort included larger compensation chambers that provide more fluid to the wick for start-up scenarios and highlighted the need to fully understand the limitations and accommodation requirements of new technologies in a system design application. Once again, seemingly minor departures from heritage configurations and limited resources led to performance and operational issues. This paper provides details into the GLAS LHP engineering development program and acceptance testing of the flight units, including the redesign effort. 2001-01-2264. A review of muscular efficiency studies for dif- ferent exercises. Luke Manier, Thomas Johnson, S. S. Nair, and J. B. Miles, University of Missouri. In this review study, information on efficiencies and characteris- tics of different exercises is presented with the goal of using the information for modeling extra- vehicular activity (EVA). Muscle activation is reported for running, walking, and cycling. The devia- tion and uncertainties in efficiency will be assessed along with effects of workload, rate of exercise, training, and various physio- logical parameters. The uncertainty involved in using VO2 con- sumption as a measure of metabolic rate is discussed. The informa- tion reported will be related to efforts to analyze exercises to simu- late EVA on earth. 2001-01-2265. Further studies quantifying human thermal modeling uncertainties. Anthony Iyoho, Samuel Thornton, and Sat- ish Nair, University of Missouri. The Wissler model and the 41 -Node Man represent two human thermal models that have been studied by this group. It is difficult to model a complex system such as the human thermoregulatory system. Some of the uncertainty stems from inaccurate parameter values. To design an accurate human thermal model, it is necessary to quantify the uncertainties caused by variations in parameter val- ues among humans. This paper identifies principal mechanisms of heat transfer within the 41 -Node Man model, identifying the domi- nant parameters via a sensitivity analysis of the equations. Quantify- ing the errors associated with these model parameters leads to a sim- ulation-based characterization of model response uncertainty with respect to several model outputs. 2001-01-2266. Modeling the human sweat thermal dynamics. Aaron Gonzales, Sudhagar Subramaniam, and Satish S. Nair, Uni- versity of Missouri. Previous sweat modeling attempts have produced several models of the human sweat regulation mechanism. To effectively use the models for control purposes, the sensitivity of the models to their parameters must be quantified. The characteristics of several mean- ingful sweat models are discussed. The parameters of each model are ranked in order to identify which parameters are the most impor- tant to the models. An objective of the study is to quantify the uncertainties in such models, to the extent possible. The sensitivity needed to measure the evaporative heat loss is calculated for a sub- ject in the calorimeter being developed at University of Missouri- Columbia. This study is part of a larger effort at the University to develop reliable human thermal models for space suit thermal mod- eling studies. 2001-01-2267. Simulation study of human thermal comfort indices. Harvey Cline, Samuel Thornton, and Satish Nair, Univer- sity of Missouri. This study investigates the complexities associated with quanti- fying human thermal comfort using indices. A detailed review of the literature is first performed. The uncertainties associated with com- fort modeling are then highlighted. Possible indices are developed and evaluated using integrated human-suit-PLSS (Portable Life Support System) simulations developed at the University of Mis- souri. The study forms part of a larger project aimed at developing automatic thermal controllers for NASA space suits. 290</page><page sequence="290">2001-01-2268-2001-01-2275 2001-01-2268. Thermal comfort control of an advanced space suit. Samuel Thornton , Wenwei Xu, and Satishi Nair , University of Missouri. This paper proposes an optimal control strategy for thermal com- fort control of an advanced space suit. During an extravehicular activity (EVA), the astronaut's metabolic rate is time- varying depending on the working load, which would prescribe different ref- erence skin temperatures. The purpose of thermal comfort control is to control the skin temperature to the reference value at a certain metabolic rate via a liquid cooling garment (LCG) for astronaut comfort. MPC is expected to achieve the control with the minimum consumable energy. After developing an operational definition of comfort, the structure of the controller and preliminary results are reported. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2270. Determination of human thermal experimen- tal uncertainty. Wee-Hee Saw, Sam Thornton, Harvey Cline, and Satish Nair, University of Missouri. Experimental apparatus simulating a space suit Portable Life Support System (PLSS) was developed for testing human thermal comfort in a suited environment. Various uncertainties of the experi- mental apparatus were studied from which the accuracy of the entire setup was determined. Experimental and simulated data from existing human thermal models were collected for similar cases. Differences/similarities between experimental and simulated data were then discussed. Based on this comparison, the human thermal model can be vali- dated or changes can be made to either the experimental setup or simulation to more accurately reflect the thermal state of a human in a suited environment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2272. Quantitative morphological analysis of spin- ach leaves grown under light-emitting diodes or sulfur- microwave lamps. Elizabeth Stryjewski and Gregory Goins, Dyna- mac Corp.; and Christopher Kelly, Florida Institute of Technology. Alternative lighting sources that offer advantages over traditional lighting regimes are being investigated for space-based plant growth applications. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and sulfur-microwave lamps are among these candidate systems because of their potential for reduced power consumption and increased radiation use effi- ciency over conventional lighting systems such as high-pressure sodium (HPS) and cool white fluorescence (CWF). The effects of LEDs and microwave lamps on plant growth must also be character- ized before they can be considered for spaceflight applications. Leaf morphology of spinach plants (Spinacia olerácea L. cv. Whitney) grown for 28 days under sulfur-microwave lamps or one of 4 LED arrays with peak output wavelengths of 660, 690, 700 and 725nm, (each supplemented with 470nm blue LEDs) was compared to con- trol plants grown under HPS and CWF. Anatomical features were similar among plants grown under the control, microwave, 660 and 690nm LED lighting systems. In contrast, significant differences in leaf and petiole structures were evident in plants grown under the 700 and 725nm LED arrays compared to the controls. Leaf thickness and cross-sectional petiole area were 25% smaller in plants grown under the 700 nm LED array and 60% smaller in plants grown under the 725 nm LED array. Additionally, the ratio of leaf palisade meso- phyll to spongy mesophyll decreased disproportionately in these plants. Under the 700 nm LED array, the palisade mesophyll was 37% thinner than the controls, yet the spongy mesophyll was not significantly thinner. Under the 725 nm LED array the palisade mesophyll was virtually undetectable, leaving nearly the entire leaf consisting of only spongy mesophyll. Structures designed for maxi- mal light interception were minimized in plants grown under the far- red LED arrays while those devoted to gas exchange were less effected. 2001-01-2273. Utilization of recovered inorganic nutrients from composted fresh or oven-dried inedible plant biomass for supporting growth of wheat in a BLSS. Neil C. Yorio, Jennifer E. Judkins, Jay L. Garland, Mary E. Hümmerich, and Teresa H. Eng- lert, Dynamac Corp. The use of composting technology is attractive to NASA's Biore- generative Life Support System (BLSS) research because it offers a potential reduction in system costs when compared to other waste recycling approaches. Water-soluble leachates from 28-day com- posted fresh or oven-dried inedible wheat biomass were amended with reagent-grade nutrients to be inorganically equivalent to 1/2- strength Hoagland's (control) replenishment solution. A portion of the fresh and oven-dried compost leachate was filtered to remove large organic particles and a majority of the microflora, and wheat plants were grown hydroponically on these amended leachates. For both the fresh and oven-dried compost leachate treatments, filtering the leachate had no effect on plant response. No significant differ- ence was observed between the fresh compost leachate treatments and the control. However, growing wheat plants on the oven-dried compost leachate treatments showed significant reductions in growth compared to the control. These results suggest that the addi- tional microbial loading and organic particulates are not responsible for previous observations of reduced growth for plants grown on compost leachates. Additionally, 28 days is sufficient to remove any phytotoxic properties from fresh compost, however a longer com- posting time may be necessary for composting oven-dried corn- poster feed material. 2001-01-2274. Using mass balance techniques to manage nutrition of hydroponically-grown sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam]. D. G. Mortley, J. H. Hill, C. K. Bonsi, W. A. Hill, and C. E. Morris, Tuskegee Univ. A mass balance nutrient management approach was used in con- trolled environment studies, to determine an appropriate nutrient solution replenishment regime for the growth of sweetpotato in nutrient film technique (NFT). Four stem cuttings (15-cm long) were planted into each of three gray PVC-1 (0.15x0.15x1.2 m) troughs in a walk-in growth chamber under a 14/10 h photoperiod, 28/22°C and 70% relative humidity. Photosynthetic photon flux at canopy level averaged 450-ļLimol m"2 s"1. Plants were grown with a modified half-Hoagland starter solution with an extra 3 mM of N for the first 4-6 weeks to accelerate vegetative growth, after which three refill solutions containing 1.5 (A), 4.5 (B), 0.75 (C), or 3 (A), 4.5 (B), and 6 (C) mM NO3 ]-N and K, respectively, were used once per week until harvest. The level of N and K in the refill solutions did not significantly influence the number of storage roots produced. Total fresh and dry biomass was significantly greater among plants replenished with the refill solution containing 4.5 mM N and K, respectively. Edible fresh and dry biomass was also greater for plants receiving the refill solution containing 4.5 mM N and K than that for plants replenished with the refill solution containing 0.75/ 6.0 mM N/K, and similar to that of plants receiving the refill solu- tion containing 1.5/3.0 mM N/K. Harvest index was significantly lower among plants replenished with the refill solution containing 4.5 mM N and K, respectively. Leaf analyses data indicated that suf- ficiency levels of N, P and K were maintained in plants replenished the refill solution containing 4.5 mM N and K, respectively, but was reduced among plants replenished with the refill solution containing 0.75/6.0 mM N/K. Thus in terms of biomass production and main- taining nutrient levels within the plant, either the refill solution con- taining 4.5 mM N and K, respectively, or the refill solution contain- ing 1.5/3.0 mM N/K can be used for replenishment. 2001-01-2275. Response of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) to increasing levels of blue light. D. G. Mortley, J. H. Hill, C. K. Bonsi, W. A. Hill, and C. E. Morris, Tuskegee Univ. Growth chamber experiments were conducted to determine the effect of varying levels of blue photons on branch growth, pod and seed yield of peanut. Seeds of 'Georgia Red' peanut cultivar were 291</page><page sequence="291">2001-01-2275-2001-01-2280 grown in 10-liter plastic pots containing a vermiculite/sand/soil media (1:1:1 v/v) under 6%, 11%, 16%, 21% and 26% blue light (320-496 nm) supplied by high intensity discharge high pressure sodium (HPS) and metal halide (MH) lamps at equal photosynthetic photon flux (PPF; 1100 pmol m V1). Neither total foliage nor pod fresh and dry mass were significantly affected by increasing blue light fraction. The length of main stem (plant height) declined lin- early in response to increasing blue light fraction. Likewise, both the number and dry mass of mature pods decreased linearly as the per- centage of blue light increased. The number of mature seeds declined linearly with increased blue light, while the decrease in seed dry mass was not significant. The dry mass of immature seeds was increased with blue light fraction up to 16%, but decline there- after. Harvest index declined linearly as blue light fraction increased. 2001-01-2276. Dynamic monitoring of nutrient species in hydroponie solutions for advanced life support. Eiichi Ono , Ken- neth A. Jordan , and Joel L. Cuello , University of Arizona. The next-generation of plant hydroponie systems for advanced life support will most likely require a dynamic monitoring capability for their nutrient species in solution for two reasons: (1) to be able to optimize nutrient use, which would help to reduce the mass and volume of stored inorganic chemicals; and (2) to be able to dynami- cally correlate the fluctuations in uptake of individual nutrient spe- cies with the plant's physiological state (e.g., stress) over time under microgravity conditions. The latter in turn will provide advanced physiological diagnoses for the crops and could help reduce the astronaut man-hours for crop maintenance. The results of this study suggested that a combination of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy and ion selective electrodes (ISEs) could be a compe- tent strategy for designing a dynamic nutrient-monitoring capability for hydroponie systems. The ICP used had a dynamic range that ade- quately encompassed the varying concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, P, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Zn in the sweetpotato hydroponie solution, with accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements at 1-4% ± 5%, respectively. Likewise, the ISE used had a dynamic range that adequately encompassed the varying concentrations of NO3" in the sweetpotato hydroponie solution, with accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements at 1-5% and ± 2%, respectively. 2001-01-2277. NDS water pressures affect growth rate by changing leaf area, not single leaf photosynthesis. O. Monje and G. W. Stutte , Dynamac Corp.; H. T. Wang , University of Colorado; and C. J. Kelly, Florida Institute of Technology. Plant growth conditions must be optimized for use in advanced life support systems during space flight. Wheat cv. Apogee was grown in a nutrient delivery system (NDS) using porous tubes held at three levels of applied water pressure (Pw), or suction: -0.5 kPa, -0.3 kPa, and -0.1 kPa for 24 days. Measurements of leaf area and dry mass were made at 5, 9, 14, 18 and 24 DAP and used to deter- mine the leaf area index (LAI), net assimilation rate (NAR), and crop growth rate (CGR). Pw did not have a significant effect on plant development until after 9 DAP, at which time growth at different treatments began to diverge. Plants grown at -0.1 kPa exhibited the largest CGR and LAI and had the greatest biomass, suggesting that -0.1 kPa was the optimal Pw. Growth analysis indicated that changes in CGR were due to changes in leaf area, rather than changes in pho- tosynthesis. There were no significant differences between measures of chlorophyll fluorescence: Fv/Fm, qN and qP of plants grown at different Pw, which further indicated that Pw had little effect on leaf photosynthesis. Slight differences in starch content of plants grown at different Pw were observed. This study served as a ground control to determine baseline data characterizing the effect of Pw on wheat growth. 2001-01-2278. Chemical and sensory characteristics of a hydroponie sweetpotato during storage. Adelia Bovell-Benjamin, Elaine Bromfield, Ralphenia Pace, and Baowu Wang, Tuskegee Univ. Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) is an economic root crop that has been selected as a candidate crop to be grown on space missions by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Mission. This study deter- mined the chemical and sensory behavior of hydroponically grown sweet potato (TU-82-155) during storage. Cured hydroponically grown sweet potatoes (HSP) were stored in palletized crates at 13°C and 80% RH for 42 days. Samples were randomly withdrawn at 0, 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 days of storage for chemical, instrumental, and sensory analyses. Judges utilized a 'just-about-right' attribute scale with five categories to assess the intensity of five sensory attributes. The HSP had a high moisture throughout storage, reflecting an over- all mean of 82±2%. The mean fat and protein contents were 0.6±0.5% and 1.8±2%, respectively. The mean carbohydrate con- tent was 15.2±3%, and the ash content ranged from 0.5±0.1% to 0.5±0.8%. There were no significant changes in the L* values (denoting lightness) during storage. The a* value (redness) showed no appreciable decline, but the b* values (yellow) reflected a decline, and a shift in the yellow color. In general, firmness decreased as storage time increased for the HSP. Overall, the chemi- cal characteristics of the HSP are comparable to those reported for various culti vars of field sweetpotatoes. The judges described the HSP as too bland and too rough, but these attributes could be treated. 2001-01-2279. Thermal engineering of Mars entry carbon/ carbon non-ablative aeroshell - Part 3. Gregory S. Hickey and Shyh-Shiuh Lih, Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and Wei Shih, AÏI- Comp, Inc. This is Part 3 of a development program to evaluate candidate nonablative aeroshell designs. The primary goal of this C/C aero- shell development task was to demonstrate the feasibility and per- formance of a lightweight C/C non-ablative aeroshell design that integrates advanced C/C materials and structural configurations. The thermal performance was evaluated by Arc Jet testing at NASA Ames of representative structural models. In this phase of the pro- gram, new carbon-carbon materials and structural core designs were evaluated, as well as an alternative aerogel material. The test models were composed of a quasi-isotropic Carbon/Carbon(C/C) front face sheet (F/S), eggcrate or honeycomb core, C/C back F/S, Carbon and resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogel insulation. Part One of this work demonstrated the feasibility through arc-jet testing and Part Two included analytical modeling of the test geometry to validate the design. In this work alternative carbon-carbon material, core con- struction and oxidation resistant coatings were used as the design variables. Testing was conducted on six test models with the arc jet temperature at nominally 1500°C. Three design configurations suc- cessfully maintained the rear surface below 150°C during 45 sec- onds of exposure. 2001-01-2280. Thermal design and analysis of the Beagle 2 lander. Simon Peskett, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The thermal design of the Mars lander Beagle 2 must ensure the probe survives all mission phases - in particular the lander must sur- vive the extremes of the Martian weather during the Operational phase. To minimize political risks and to simplify the Cruise and Coast phase thermal designs, a baseline architecture for the lander which does not use radioisotope heater units (RHUs) has been con- ceived. This design relies on the absorption of solar energy during the day using a coated solar absorber unit (SAU) and the storage of this energy as sensible heat in order to maintain the temperature of the battery and critical electronics during the night with minimum energy demand. Extensive modeling of the lander for a range of environmental conditions has been performed to optimize the ther- mal design with respect to performance, mass and heater power. 292</page><page sequence="292">200 1 -0 1 -228 1 -200 1 -0 1 -2287 2001-01-2281. Thermal design of the BEAGLE 2 gas analysis package - The Martian life detector. S. G. Price , S. Barraclough, I. J. P raine, and J. Clemmet, Astrium UK; and C. Pilinger, Open Univ. Beagle 2 is the British-led Martian Lander which will be trans- ported to Mars by the Mars Express spacecraft, due for launch in 2003. The Beagle 2 Gas Analysis Package (GAP) is designed to ana- lyze samples of the Martian soil and atmosphere collected by the Beagle 2 lander equipment, for evidence of the chemical signatures of the biological processes associated with life. The GAP has been designed to process complex gas mixtures obtained both from the Martian atmosphere and as a result of ther- mal (pyrolysis) and chemical (combustion and fluorination) pro- cessing of solid samples within the Sample Handling and Distribu- tion System (SHADS). The temperature requirement within the heated section of the chemical reactors is upward of 1000°C. However there is a need to maintain the external surface of the reactor at a low temperature, so as not to have adverse effects on others parts of the equipment. The design of the Beagle 2 reactors has to be such as to perform the life detection analysis in a Martian atmosphere while minimising their effect on other GAP components. This paper discusses the thermal needs, modelling and design of the GAP Martian Life Detector. 2001-01-2282. The thermal control concept of the Mars Net- lander Surface Module. Fabienne Serene and Irénée Alet, CNES; Reinhard Schlitt , Oliver Romberg , and Franck Bodendieck, OHB System GmbH; K. Seiferling , IFP Münster; and Konstantin Gon- charov, Lavochkin Association. The Netlander mission aims to deploying on the surface of Mars a network of 4 landers, which will perform simultaneously measure- ments in order to study the internal structure of Mars, its sub- surface and its atmosphere. This paper describes the phase B thermal control concept of the Netlander Surface Module, taking into account various thermal environments from the cruise to Mars phase until the landing and the one Martian year phase on the Mars surface. The paper focuses on two specific thermal tests. The first one is a thermal conductivity measurement of three pre-selected insulation materials in a 6 - 10 hPa CO2 environment, and the second one is a performance test of a Loop Heat Pipe designed to comply the Netlander Surface Module needs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2283. Actual knowledge of Martian environment and associated thermal control and life support solutions for the future. Marie-Christine Desjean, Centre National d'Etudes Spa- tiales Toulouse. The Martian environment is known actually through the mea- surements made by the few vehicles having landed on the Mars sur- face - Viking 1 and 2 and Pathfinder mainly - and from observations of spacecraft orbiting from Mars Orbit. Direct observations from the Earth ground are also available. Recent Mars Global Surveyor data have increased the knowledge but many points remain unknown. The recent loss of Mars Polar Lander has increased the scientific people eagerness about planet data and ground configuration. The paper presents the present status of knowledge about the atmospheric parameters of the Martian environment including dust assumptions. It will describe the various solutions and databases for modeling the atmosphere and the uncertainties on the parameters. It will make the point on the thermal control associated problems and solutions for atmospheric transfer and landed vehicles. For this, it will focus on the environmental challenges linked to this particular environment: difficulties in the thermal control because of very low temperatures, special arrangements for the solar panels (solar cells), special processes in all the mechanisms because of dust clogging, particular design linked to storms on Mars, etc. The present level of knowledge of this environment and steps to be performed to allow man on Mars in the future will be presented as well as technology gaps for a Martian ECLSS. At last, mass linked limitations will be described. 2001-01-2284. Technical issues of centrifuge rotor system clarified through engineering model test. Fumio Otsuki, Hirohiko Uematsu , and Yasuhiro Nakamura , National Space Development Agency of Japan; and Koichi Ohtomi, Yuichi Chida, and Ryou Oka- mura, Toshiba Corp. The Centrifuge Rotor (CR) system is a significant new develop- ment that will provide artificial gravity for gravitational experiments involving relatively large biological specimens such as small ani- mals and plants. The Engineering Model (EM) test has been performed to evalu- ate the rotating performance and the vibration suppression system including active balancing system, vibration isolation mechanism, and active damping system. The EM test results show that the CR can create a stable artificial gravity environment. However, some CR technical issues have been clarified through the EM test such as the active balancing control, the active damping control, the vibration isolation mechanism, the structural reliability, and the air drag effect. The solution toward the Flight Model (FM) design will be discussed. 2001-01-2286.

Best , Vector CAD ; and Howard G. Levine , Dynamac Corp. The BRIC-LED (Biological Research In Canisters-Light Emit- ting Diode) PDFU (Petri Dish Fixation Unit) apparatus was origi- nally developed to support the on-orbit growth and subsequent fixa- tion of any biological material amenable to petri dish culture in space. The PDFU component has been modified to support a two- stage fluid provision option so that investigations can incorporate an initial injection of a biologically active solution followed by a subsequent fixative injection to terminate the experiment in space. Crew-operated actuator tools initiate the delivery of the liquid treat- ments. Aseptic protocols have been developed which permit the entire experiment to be conducted under sterile conditions. 2001-01-2287. The Advanced Animal Habitat-Centrifuge (AAH-C). Anthony Sharpe, John Vellinger , Mark Ainsworth, James Cherry , and Mark Deuser, Space Hardware Optimization Technol- ogy (SHOT), Inc.; and Jeffrey Alberts, STAR Enterprises, Inc. The Advanced Animal Habitat - Centrifuge (AAH-C), currently under development by STAR Enterprises and SHOT, Inc., for the NASA Ames Research Center, is a controlled-environment accom- modation for microgravity biological research with rats or mice and, potentially, other rodents. The AAH-C is designed primarily for long-duration operation on the International Space Station (ISS) and also for operation in the Shuttle Middeck and SPACEHAB™. The AAH-C is transported to and from the ISS in Avionics Bay 3A of the Shuttle Modified Middeck (with biospecimens), or in the Mini- Pressurized Logistics Module (without biospecimens). The AAH-C, which is modularized and internally reconfigurable, is capable of accommodating mice and rats from weanlings to adults. The Habitat is designed for operation in the ISS Habitat Holding Rack (HHR) (providing a microgravity environment), on the 2.5 m Centrifuge Rotor (providing a selectable acceleration environment from micro- gravity to 2.0 g), and at the Life Sciences Glovebox (providing for experimental procedures and unique specimen manipulations). The AAH-C provides all of the systems (food and water delivery, waste management, lighting, video, and environmental control) necessary to maintain optimal animal husbandry, while maximizing scientific output. The AAH-C is currently scheduled for Increment 17A launch in October, 2005. 293</page><page sequence="293">2001-01-2288-2001-01-2293 2001-01-2288.

Providing an optimal environment utilizing the avian development facility for research in microgravity. John Vellinger, Rachel Ormsby, Nathan Thomas, David Kennedy, Douglas Hudson, and Paul Todd, Space Hardware Optimization Technology (SHOT), Inc. Space Hardware Optimization Technology (SHOT), Inc., has developed an Avian Development Facility (ADF) to isolate the effects of microgravity on embryogenesis of Japanese quail embryos by initiating and preserving embryo development in weightlessness. The ADF will monitor embryogenesis during orbit by fixing speci- mens at various times and will shut down the experiment before leaving orbit. In effect, the ADF makes every attempt to minimize launch and re-entry effects in order to isolate and preserve the effects of the experimental variable(s) of the space environment. The ADF also allows for egg rotation (similar to turning in a natural environment) and provides separate carousel rotation to accommo- date centrifugation controls (up to 1-G) in a microgravity environ- ment. Although no non-avian applications of ADF have yet been implemented, application to several fields can be considered, such as cell science, plant science, invertebrate biology and aquatic biol- ogy. The ADF is currently scheduled to fly and be operated on the space shuttle mid-deck in November 2001 during the UF-1 flight to the International Space Station and back. 2001-01-2290. Air/foam insulation for a freezer in ļig conditions - trade-off, analysis and on-earth verification. M. Canchado, M. Pastor, and E. Garcia, NTE, S.A. This paper shows the results obtained after the development of the thermal insulation concept described and used for freezers and coolers in manned spacecraft submitted to micro-gravity environ- ment. The use of foam walls for space refrigerators have some disad- vantages: mass, flammability and toxicity. The BIOLAB (European Biology Laboratory onboard Interna- tional Space Station, ISS) facility is equipped with two thermal con- ditioning units (TCU) whose housing consist of hollow carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) walls. This technology reduces the mass of each one by 20%, and the development cost, when compared with foam wall insulation (4Kg over a total of 20Kg). This paper describes the design of the hollow solution and pres- ents the results of the analysis and test that were done. The test and analysis protocol used to validate the finite element model (FEM) and the simulation of the performances on orbit is presented as well. 2001-01-2291. Air revitalization, an inevitable prerequisite for future affordable crewed missions to space. Willigert Raatsc- hen and Wolfram Knorr, Astrium GmbH. The current ECLS baseline of the International Space Station (ISS) contains an open oxygen loop. Breathable oxygen, generated by electrolysis of water, is supplied to all habitable modules. The crew of max. 7 astronauts converts the oxygen into metabolic carbon dioxide, which needs to be removed from the ISS atmosphere. Adsorption of CO2 is achieved through molecular sieves, desorption of CO2 is conducted by evacuation into space. This open process needs approx. 1500 kg of water upload mass annually. More than 75% of this upload mass can be saved, if the open oxygen loop will be closed. This paper outlines the closed-loop air revitalization system of Astrium, ARES, which has been successfully tested in closed cham- ber tests. It demonstrates in detail the technical application of ARES on ISS and outlines the commercial benefits. The second part of the paper describes ARES for a Mars habitat with a closed oxygen and hydrogen loop. The third part of the paper shows the use of ARES technology for In-Situ-Resource-Utilization, to generate propellant from Mar- tian atmosphere. 2001-01-2292. Methane pyrolysis to close the ECLS hydrogen loop. H. Funke, Astrium GmbH; W. Jehle, DaimlerChrysler Aero- space/Dornier ; and G. Tan, ESA/ESTEC. For long-duration manned space missions an advanced ECLSS is required to recycle all consumables to a maximum extend possi- ble. Recycling of oxygen out of the atmosphere in a crewed space- craft is more important the longer the duration of the mission (ISS, Moon, Mars). On behalf of ESA, an air revitalization technology, to reclaim the oxygen from metabolically produced carbon dioxide, was developed in a step- wise approach since 1985. Herein, the air revitalization system technology demonstrator (ARSD), designed for a crew of 3 men, was built and successfully tested in a closed chamber for about 600 hours. The current concept of the ARSD leads still to a considerable loss of hydrogen, due to the production of methane, which is currently vented. In order to close the hydrogen loop in the air revitalization sys- tem, a study was performed to demonstrate the feasibility to decom- pose methane, reclaim the hydrogen and dispose the deposited car- bon. For this purpose a breadboard model of a pyrolysis reactor was developed and tested. This paper presents the results of the tests of the breadboarded methane pyrolysis assembly (MPA) and a system assessment with respect to the required consumables, resupply and mass savings by closing this way the hydrogen loop. 2001-01-2293. A trade study on Sabatíer CO2 reduction sub- system for advanced missions. F. F. J eng, Lockheed Martin Space Operations; and C. H. Lin, Johnson Space Center/NASA. An analysis on O2 usage, water contents in food, CO2 and H2 availability, water generation capability of CO2 reduction sub- systems, water balance, etc., was conducted to evaluate the feasibil- ity of integrating a CO2 reduction subsystem into an air revitaliza- tion system. The effects of CO2 reduction subsystem operating parameters on water recovery efficiencies and water generation capabilities were analyzed. Water mass balances for advanced missions were con- ducted for advanced missions. Equivalent system mass method was used to calculate payoff time for integrating the CO2 reduction sub- system into an air revitalization system. Decision criteria based on payoff time for integrating a CRS for advanced missions were developed. 294</page><page sequence="294">2001-01-2294-2001-01-2303 2001-01-2294. Development of a membrane-based gas trap. C. Knüppel , ASTRIUM RST Rostock ; K. Brodi and J. Resemann, ASTRIUM Space Infrastructure; and G. Tan , ESA/ESTEC. Under micro-gravity conditions the removal of free gas bubbles from a streaming fluid is an exceptional task considering the absence of buoyancy. The solution to this problem is sought in the use of membranes. The work was performed under ESA/ESTEC contract. 2001-01-2296. Mass reduction and nutrient recovery during biodégradation of sweetpotato residue. A. A. Trotman and H. A. Aglan , Tuskegee Univ ; and M. El-Halwagi, Auburn Univ. The Advanced Life Support (ALS) paradigm rests on the idea of integrating complex biological systems with tightly monitored mechanical systems, in order to effectively engineer an ecosystem. The benefits and objectives of the biodégradation studies conducted at Tuskegee University are compatible with those, including higher plants, in ALS for extended planetary habitation. Also, the treatment of inedible portions of crops required that issues of mass and energy be considered. The Waste Management and Resource Recycling Working Group of the Center for Food and Environmental Systems for Human Exploration of Space evaluated both the composting pro- cess and an automated aerobic bioreactor process, to treat solid waste from inedible sweetpotato biomass. The composter used in these studies was an Oxymax system equipped with carbon dioxide and oxygen monitors. The composter was effective in providing sixty-seven percent solid mass reduction and the nutrients recycled were nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, cop- per, iron, zinc and boron. The model development considers mass reduction and nutrient recovery streams from inedible sweetpotato biomass. The mass reduction and nutrient recovery profile from the composter system, were modeled as potential process integration streams available for re-direction into the crop production sub- system. In modeling the process to examine systems integration of the waste management and process recycling subsystems, the biore- generative approach provides an alternative and robust means of treating solid plant residue. 2001-01-2297. Optimization of feedstock composition and pre-processing for composting in advanced life support systems. Sukwon Kang and John A. Hogan, Rutgers , the State University of New Jersey. Advanced Life Support (ALS) systems designed for long- duration manned space missions, particularly permanent bases on the Moon or Mars, are likely to employ extensive use of regenera- tive closed-loop systems, including the production of higher plants for food. Such systems will produce substantial amounts of inedible plant material in addition to other standard mission wastes. Com- posting is one of the several methods currently under investigation for waste processing and resource recovery in ALS systems. While composting is a robust microbiological process that can be utilized to treat a variety of organic materials under a wide range of environ- mental conditions, both feedstock preparation and process control require optimization. For instance, initial waste feedstock composi- tion, carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N), particle size, and moisture con- tent are critical factors for ensuring optimal processing conditions and maximal rates of degradation. In order to efficiently and flexibly coordinate various factors in an ALS composting system, a manage- ment information system (MIS) will be beneficial, particularly in regard to feedstock preparation. To this end, an MIS was developed to examine and provide an interface between waste production and compost feedstock preparation. In addition, operational and process- ing conditions, and other variable conditions arising from other sub- systems (Crew, Biomass Production and Food Processing) in ALS systems are examined. 2001-01-2298. Advanced control techniques for efficient and robust operation of advanced life support systems. C. W. Paw- łowski, A. M. Bell, and S. Crawford, Orbital Sciences Corp.; W. A. Sethares, University of Wisconsin, Madison; and C. Finn, NASA Ames Research Center. This paper examines the structure and performance of three con- trol strategies for a regenerative life support system constrained by mass balance equations. A novel agent-based control strategy derived from economic models of markets is compared to two stan- dard control strategies, proportional feedback and optimal control. The control systems require different amounts of knowledge about the underlying system dynamics, utilize different amounts of infor- mation about the current state of the system, and differ in their abil- ity to achieve system- wide performance goals. Simulations illustrate the dynamic behavior of the life support system after it is perturbed away from its equilibrium state or nominal operating point under the three different control strategies. The performance of these strate- gies is discussed in the context of system-wide performance goals such as efficiency and robustness. 2001-01-2299. Evaluation of fieldbus and software compo- nent technologies for use with advanced life support. Richard Boulanger, Sverdrup Technology; David Overland, NASA Johnson Space Center ; and Harry Jones, NASA Ames Research Center. Industrial process control has been dominated by closed architec- tures and proprietary protocols for the last three decades. In the late 1990's, the advent of open fieldbus and middleware standards has greatly changed the process control arena. Fieldbus has pushed con- trol closer and closer to the process itself. Middleware standards have exposed real-time process data to higher level software appli- cations. Control systems can now be designed to minimize the reconfiguration costs associated with design changes. How can Advanced Life Support (ALS) benefit from these technologies? We consider designing the control system for the BIO-Plex and evaluate how complex it will be, the effort it will require, and how much it will it cost. Various fieldbus technologies were compared and Foundation Fieldbus was chosen for detailed evaluation. This new fieldbus was integrated with an existing ALS system. OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) for Process Control (OPC) was used to serve data to subscribing applications (control, archiving, operator interface, etc.) Various metrics were established to quantify the costs of hardware integration, software development, and system reliability. Software effort was measured using the feature points approach. 2001-01-2302. Survey of modeling failures, dynamics, and nonlinearities in advanced life support systems. Harry Jones, NASA Ames Research Center. System failures, dynamics, and nonlinearities can cause unac- ceptable performance and damaging instability in Advanced Life Support (ALS) systems. Much current ALS modeling assumes that ALS systems are linear, static, and failure-free. But in reality most ALS hardware is subject to failure, real ALS systems are dynamic, and many ALS processors are nonlinear beyond a limited operating range. Modeling and simulation are needed to study the stability and time behavior of nonlinear dynamic ALS systems with failures and to develop appropriate controls. The nonlinear dynamics of ALS systems has many interesting potential consequences. Different equilibrium points may be reached for different initial conditions. The system stability can depend on the exact system inputs and initial conditions. The system may oscillate or even in rare cases behave chaotically. Temporary internal hardware failures or external perturbations can lead to dynamic instability and total ALS system failure. Appropriate con- trol techniques can restore reliable operation and minimize the effects of dynamic instabilities due to anomalies or perturbations. 2001-01-2303. Modeling of photosynthesis in soybean crops using artificial neural networks. Frank Zee, Jet Propulsion Labo- ratory. 295</page><page sequence="295">2001-01-2303-2001-01-2310 Important to NASA's Advanced Life Support program is the development of an autonomous, dynamic, self-contained bioregen- erative life support system for future, long-duration spacecraft and space stations to provide fresh food, air, water and to recycle waste products. These systems will rely on plants to rejuvenate the air and produce food through the process of photosynthesis and purify water through the process of transpiration. An intelligent, autonomous, reliable, and robust control system must be developed and applied to dynamically manage, control and optimize plant-based life sup- port functions to allow the efficient growth of plants, providing the maximum amount of life essentials while using minimal resources. System identification and modeling of plant growth behavior must first be developed to characterize plant growth functions in order to develop an efficient control system. We have developed an artificial neural network model to charac- terize the photosynthesis process of soybean crops under various environmental conditions. It is a 2-layer feedforward neural network architecture which inputs the crop type, age, and the environmental conditions of the crop canopy: carbon dioxide level, light intensity, temperature, and relative humidity and outputs the predicted net photosynthesis or assimilation rate produced under these conditions. The neural network model was trained from controlled environment soybean crop experiments conducted at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey where dynamic plant responses over a range of environmental conditions were collected. This paper will discuss in more detail the motivation for developing the crop model, the neural network model and performance and the crop experiments and data collected by Rutgers University. 2001-01-2304. Advanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool (ALSSAT) using Microsoft® Excel. H. H. (Jannivine) Y eh, Frank F. Jeng , and Cheryl B. Brown, Lockheed Martin Space Operations Co. ; and Chin H. Lin, and Michael K. Ewert, NASA Johnson Space Center. The development of an optimum regenerative Advanced Life Support (ALS) system for future Mars missions has been a crucial issue in the space industry. Considering the numerous potential technologies for subsystems with the complexity of the Air Revital- ization System (ARS), Water Reclamation System (WRS), and Waste Management System of the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), it will be time-consuming and costly to determine the best combination of these technologies without a powerful sizing analysis tool. Johnson Space Center (JSC), there- fore, initiated the development of ALSSAT using Microsoft® Excel for this purpose. ALSSAT has been developed based upon the ALS Requirement and Design Definition Document. In 1999, a paper describing the development of ALSSAT with its built-in ARS mass balance model was published in ICES. Since then, ALSSAT has been expanded to include the mass balance and sizing models for the WRS and the Biomass Production Chamber. ALSSAT has also been upgraded to allow user selection of resource recovery options. For different mission scenarios, ALSSAT will allow the user to per- form detailed sizing of the ECLSS system based on suggested default values or user inputs for different combinations of technolo- gies in the ECLSS. This analysis tool will assist the user in perform- ing system trade studies as well as system optimization efficiently and economically. 2001-01-2305. Enzyme-based facilitated transport: Use of vacuum-induced sweep for enhanced CO2 capture. J.- J. Ge, M. C. Trachtenberg, and M. L. McGregor, Sapient' s Institute; and R. M. Cowan, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. The technologies for processing respiratory gases to support humans and plants and to provide material for regeneration of oxy- gen in Advanced Life Support applications remain far from optimal. Here we report on our ongoing efforts to develop an enzyme-based, hybrid, facilitated transport bioreactor for the efficient capture of CO2 from dilute respiratory gas streams. In this paper, we examine four different cases with respect to maintaining a driving force for removal of CO2 from respiratory gas. These consist of employing each of the following on the sweep side of the reactor: 1) a relatively high flow rate of an inert sweep gas (in this case argon) at a nominal pressure of 101.3 kPaabs (0 kPa gauge); 2) vacuum at a pressure of 16.3 kPaabs (-85 kPa gauge); 3) a vacuum assisted flow of sweep gas (argon or air) flowing at a rate of 4 seem (standard cubic centimeters per minute) and a pressure of 16.3 kPaabs and, 4) a vacuum-assisted flow of water vapor as the driving force for flow on the sweep side with or without the addition of argon or air as an added sweep gas. Theoretical calculations show that the flow of an inert sweep gas, the application of a vacuum, and the combined application of vac- uum with a small amount of sweep gas (fixed gas and/or water vapor) can result in effective removal of CO2 from respiratory gas, provided the CO2 driving force is maintained. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical results. They show that any condition using a sweep gas can result in effective removal of CO2. Theory also confirms that, as was observed, without an added sweep gas the sweep side pressure of 16.3 kPaabS should not be effective. Furthermore, we calculate that with appropriate combina- tions of temperature and vacuum pressure it is possible to get effec- tive CO2 removal using water vapor alone as the sweep gas. This strategy results in a situation where it is possible to obtain a dry gas product from the permeate side that is extraordinarily enriched in CO2. This work provides further evidence that our system will be suitable for all NASA applications in low Earth orbit (LEO - ISS, SS and EVA), as well as for long-term expeditions, e.g., to the moon or to Mars. 2001-01-2306. Biologically inspired folding structure for space habitats. Aleksandra Konopek, University of Wuppertal. This report describes a folding structure that creates the maxi- mum volume of a sphere from a cylinder. A mechanism for folding the module's support structure covered with a flexible shell (like the one developed for Transhab) allows the module to be folded for its transfer to orbit aboard the space shuttle. In space it is inflated to be brought into its spherical shape. The support structure which sta- bilizes the inflated module, carries elements such as life support equipment and stowage racks. An outfitting for these kind of mod- ules is proposed. The sphere is compared to its historical back- ground and the folding structure is shown in comparison with archi- tectural and biological principles. 2001-01-2308. Toward a second-generation electronic nose at JPL: Sensing film optimization studies. M. A. Ryan, M. L. Homer, H. Zhou, K. Manatí, and A. Manfreda, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Development of a second-generation Electronic Nose at JPL is focusing on optimization of the sensing films to increase sensitivity and optimization of the array. Toward this goal, studies have focused on sources of noise in the films, alternatives to carbon black as conductive medium, measurement techniques, and development of an analytical approach to polymer selection to maximize the abili- ties of the array to distinguish among compounds. 2001-01-2310. The results of microbiological research of environmental microflora of orbital station Mir. N. D. Novikova, N. A. Polikarpov, S. V. Poddubko, and E. A. Deshevaya, SSC RF IMBP. The base unit of the orbital station (OS) MIR was launched on February 20, 1986, and on March 13 the first crew arrived to it. From that moment a unique microbiocenosis started forming in closed environment of the space station, and vital activity of micro- organisms continued for the period of the next 15 years in specifi- cally changed environment, in conditions of continuous influence of a set of factors, which are intrinsic of space flight. A total of 250 species of bacteria and fungi were found onboard orbital station MIR, among which microorganisms capable of resident coloniza- tion of the environment of space objects as a unique anthropotech- 296</page><page sequence="296">2001-01-2310-2001-01-2319 nological niche were revealed. In such conditions the evolution of microflora is followed by the rise of medical and technical risks that can affect both sanitary-microbiological conditions of the environ- ment and the safety and reliability characteristics of space equip- ment. The latter is caused by progressing biological damage to the structural materials. Dynamics of microbial loading does not have linearly progressing character, but it is a wavy process of alternation of the microflora activation and stabilization phases, on this back- ground there is a change of the species dominating by quantity and prevalence. The accumulated data is the evidence of the necessity of the constant control for the microbial environmental factors to maintain their sanitary and microbiological optimum condition and to prevent the processes of constructional materials biodestruction. 2001-01-2312. Test of development condensing heat exchanger to characterize particulates and metals concentration in ISS condensate. Layne Carter , NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. An evaluation of a development Condensing Heat Exchanger (CHX) was conducted at the MSFC ECLS Test Facility. The pur- pose of this test was to assess the effect of particulates and metals in the CHX condensate on downstream components, primarily the Air/Water Separator and the Back Pressure Relief Valve (BPRV). This test was performed using a flight-like CHX to simulate the par- ticulate load and the concentration of metals from the ISS CHX coating. Two designs of the flight BPRV used on ISS were tested to assess the effect of particulates on the valve operation. As expected, the original design of the BPRV showed it was susceptible to particulate blockage. Particulate levels were not as significant as those observed in condensate generated during ground tests of the Lab and Airlock modules. The concentration of silver measured in the condensate varied throughout the test, thus additional testing will be required to define the steady-state concentration at nominal flow rates and estimate the life of the CHX coating. 2001-01-2314. Development status and maintainability fea- tures of ISS oxygen generation and water processor assemblies. Dale Cloud and Robert E. Kundrotas , Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International , Inc. Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc., (HSSSI) is under contract to NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to develop a Water Processor Assembly (WPA) and Oxygen Gener- ation Assembly (OGA) for the International Space Station (ISS). The WPA produces potable quality water from humidity conden- sate, carbon dioxide reduction water, water obtained from fuel cells, reclaimed urine distillate, shower, handwash and oral hygiene waste waters. The Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) electrolyzes pota- ble water from the Water Recovery System (WRS) to provide gas- eous oxygen to the Space Station module atmosphere. The OGA produces oxygen for metabolic consumption by crew and biological specimens. The OGA also replenishes oxygen lost by experiment ingestion, airlock depressurization, CO2 venting, and leakage. As a byproduct, gaseous hydrogen is generated. The hydrogen will be supplied at a specified pressure range to support future utilization. Initially, the hydrogen will be vented overboard to space vacuum. This paper provides the status of the development activities for the OGA and WPA and describes the design features incorporated to meet NASA's requirements for maintainability. 2001-01-2316. Discharge characteristics of the International Space Station (ISS) portable fire extinguisher (PFE) and the effect on closed volumes. Charles E. Martin , ERC, Incorporated; Will Downs , Sverdrup Technology Incorporated; and Paul Wieland ', NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The Portable Fire Extinguisher (PFE) is used to displace oxygen and cool a closed volume to prevent/eliminate a fire hazard on the International Space Station (ISS). An analysis and test was per- formed on the discharge characteristics of the PFE system on a pay- load rack volume. Analytical data was developed to support the test data and determine the real versus ideal gas state of the carbon diox- ide (CO2) during discharge into the rack. This paper presents the analytical and test data for PFE discharge to determine applicability of this system to rack and open volume fires with respect to mass discharged, local area concentration, tem- perature, and displacement volume. Ancillary to this analysis is a consideration of the local open volume carbon dioxide concentra- tion and the probable impact on the crew and atmosphere revitaliza- tion and supply system for ISS. This report will include testing data recently performed at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The data from the simulation tool Generalized Fluid Flow Simulation Program (GFSSP) is included. 2001-01-2317. Bioregenerative planetary life support systems test complex (BIO-Plex): Progress to date. Jennifer D. Villarreal and Terry O. Tri , NASA Johnson Space Center. The BIO-Plex is a key component in the testing capability of NASA's Advanced Life Support (ALS) Program. BIO-Plex will serve as a test facility capable of supporting long-duration evalua- tions of integrated systems that produce food, purify water, regener- ate oxygen, and supply clean air to human test crews. The major test facility is comprised of a set of interconnected chambers with a sealed internal environment, which will be capable of supporting test crews of four individuals for periods exceeding one year. In this tightly controlled, closed loop system, hypogravity compatible life support systems for use on planetary surfaces such as Mars or the Moon will be evaluated during long-duration tests with human sub- jects inside the BIO-Plex at Johnson Space Center (JSC). The main focus of BIO-Plex is to provide a platform with which to integrate current and future regenerable systems technologies, test these tech- nologies with humans in-the-loop, and ultimately maximize their efficiency, reliability, and effectiveness. The advanced technology systems to be tested will consist of both biological and physico- chemical components and will perform all required crew life support functions. This paper provides a description of the proposed test 'missions' to be supported by the BIO-Plex and the current status of the design and build-up of the facility. 2001-01-2318. Dynamic model of the BIO-Plex air revitaliza- tion system. Cory K. Finn , NASA Ames Research Center; and Karen E. Meyers and Bruce Duffleld, Lockheed Martin. The BIO-Plex facility will need to support a variety of life sup- port system designs and operational strategies. These systems will be tested and evaluated in the BIO-Plex facility. An important goal of the life support program is to identify designs that best meet all size and performance constraints for a variety of possible future mis- sions. Integrated human testing is a necessary step in reaching this goal. System modeling and analysis will also play an important role in this endeavor. Currently, simulation studies are being used to esti- mate air revitalization buffer and storage requirements in order to develop infrastructure requirements of the BIO-Plex facility. Simu- lation studies are also being used to verify that the envisioned opera- tion strategy will be able to meet all performance criteria. In this paper, a simulation study is presented for a nominal BIO-Plex sce- nario with a high-level of crop growth. A general description of the dynamic mass flow model is provided, along with some simulation results. The paper also discusses sizing and operations issues and describes plans for future simulation studies. 2001-01-2319. Preliminary designs of the biomass production system for the bioregenerative planetary life support systems test complex. Daniel J. Barta, NASA Johnson Space Center; and Juan M. Castillo, Lockheed-Martin Space Operations. The Biomass Production System (BPS) is one of eight systems which make up the advanced life support system planned for the Bioregenerative Planetary Life Support Systems Test Complex (BIO-Plex), a multi-chamber human-rated test facility under devel- opment at NASA Johnson Space Center. The chief goal of the BPS is to support food crop production from propagation and seeding to 297</page><page sequence="297">2001-01-2319-2001-01-2324 the harvest and storage of raw agricultural products. The BPS will utilize two Biomass Production Chambers (BPC1 and BPC2) that will be internally outfitted with plant growth systems that are opti- mized for yield per unit of area and volume. This paper gives a syn- opsis of designs of the Biomass Production System presented at a preliminary design review conducted August 3, 2000, emphasizing BPC1. In these designs the chamber will have 79 m2 of area for crop growth. 2001-01-2320. Estimating plant growth area with the biomass production chamber sizing model. Cheryl B. Brown and Wen- Ching Lee , Lockheed Martin Space Operations. The Biomass Production Chamber (BPC) Sizing Model has been designed to incorporate plant growth chamber options into NASA's Advanced Life Support Sizing Analysis Tool. The concept addressed by the model is that the gas exchange from a biomass pro- duction chamber, in conjunction with human metabolic data and food consumption rates, can be used to estimate the chamber size necessary for the gas exchange and food production rate required for a specific crew size. NASA's baseline design utilizes a 78m2 (840 ft2) plant growth area and a 9.45m (31 ft) center shelf length. Using an iterative com- parison method, the center shelf is incremented by 1 .5m (5 ft) sec- tions until necessary food production requirements and gas exchange rates are satisfied. 2001-01-2321. Bioregenerative planetary life support systems test complex (BIO-Plex) food processing system; a dual task approach. Michele Perchonok , National Space Biomedical Research Institute; Elena Vittadini, Opta Food Ingredients; Beverly E. Swango and Mary E. Toerne, Spacehab , Inc.; and Laurie Peter- son , Lockheed-Martin. A Bioregenerative Planetary Life Support Test Complex, BIO- Plex, is currently being constructed at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, TX. This facility will attempt to answer the ques- tions involved in assembling a lunar or planetary base. Long- duration space missions require development of both a Transit Food System and a Lunar or Planetary Food System. These two systems are intrinsically different since the first one will be utilized in the transit vehicle in microgravity conditions while the second will be used in conditions of partial gravity (hypogravity). The Transit Food System will consist of prepackaged food with an extended shelf life of 3-5 years. It will be supplemented with salad crops that will be consumed fresh. The Lunar or Planetary Food System will allow for food processing of crops in the presence of some gravitational force (1/6 to 1/3 that of Earth). Crops such as wheat, soybean, rice, potato, peanut, dried beans, and salad crops, will be processed to final products to provide a nutritious, safe, and acceptable diet for the crew. The design of the food system will require optimization within several constraints. Some of these constraints will be to minimize power, mass, water usage, waste production, and volume needs. Concurrently, the food system must maximize the safety, accept- ability, and nutritional content of the food. The balancing of these constraints will be the challenge in developing a food processing system for planetary missions. 2001-01-2322. Food processing systems for long-term plane- tary missions: The design of a prototype for soy processing. Mary Toerne , Beverly Swango , and Ivan By ford, Spacehab, Inc.; and Michele Perchonok, National Space Biomedical Research Insti- tute. In preparation for a future manned mission to Mars, food- processing systems are being developed for use during the antici- pated 18-month stay on the planet's surface. Design of these proto- types address the special needs of a self-contained environment nec- essary to support the crew during the long-term mission. This self- contained environment will be a bio-regenerative life support sys- tem, dubbed BIO-Plex, and will house the crew and all appurtenant life support and scientific research equipment. Designs of food processing systems in such an environment address limited space requirements, minimal energy and water use, minimal waste stream generation, low equipment weight, limited crew task time, and high-quality food production which satiates the nutritional and psychological needs of the crew. Additionally, the system must function in a 0.3g -environment. First-generation prototypes have been developed to process exotic crop cultivars of wheat and soy to be grown within the BIO- Plex during the surface stay. Two prototype systems have been designed to process soybeans, while a third system will process wheat. This paper addresses the first prototype, a compact, highly auto- mated system that produces soymilk, tofu, okara, and whey (STOW Processor) from raw soybeans. The system can produce soymilk by various methods and can produce various styles of tofu. 2001-01-2323. Modeling of a composting system within BIO- Plex. Luis F. Rodriguez , Sukwon Kang, and John A. Hogan, Rutgers Univ.; and Cory Finn, NASA Ames Research Center. BIO-Plex is a ground-based test bed currently under develop- ment by NASA for testing technologies and practices that may be utilized in future long-term life support missions. All aspects of such an Advanced Life Support (ALS) System must be considered to confidently construct a reliable system, which will not only allow the crew to survive in harsh environments, but allow the crew time to perform meaningful research. Effective handling of solid wastes is a critical aspect of the system, especially when recovery of resources contained in the waste is required. This is particularly important for ALS Systems configurations that include a Biomass Production Chamber. In these cases, significant amounts of inedible biomass waste may be produced, which can ultimately serve as a repository of necessary resources for sustaining life, notably carbon, water, and plant nutrients. Numerous biological and physicochemical solid waste process- ing options have been considered. Biological options include com- posting, aerobic digestion, and anaerobic digestion. Physicochemi- cal options include pyrolysis, SCWO, various incineration configu- rations, microwave incineration, magnetically assisted gasification, and low temperature plasma reaction. Modeling of these options is a necessary step to assist in the design process. A previously devel- oped top-level dynamic mass balance model of BIO-Plex imple- mented in MATLAB® Simulink for the use of systems analysis and design has been adopted for this analysis. Previously, this model only considered incineration for solid waste processing. Present work, reported here, includes the expansion of this model to include a composting system and analysis of this system. 2001-01-2324. BIO-Plex thermal control system design. Richard D.

Engineers at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) are using innova- tive strategies to design the TCS for the Bio-regenerative Planetary Life Support Systems Test Complex (BIO-Plex), a regenerative advanced life support system ground test bed. This paper provides a current description of the BIO-Plex TCS design, testing objectives, analyses, descriptions of the TCS test articles expected to be tested in the BIO-Plex, and forward work regarding TCS. The TCS has been divided into some subsystems identified as permanent 'infra- structure' for the BIO-Plex and others that are 'test articles' that may change from one test to the next. The infrastructure subsystems are the Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC), the Crew Chambers Internal Thermal Control Subsystem (CC ITCS), the Bio- mass Production Chamber Internal Thermal Control Subsystem (BPC ITCS), the Waste Heat Distribution Subsystem (WHDS) and the External Thermal Control Subsystem (ETCS). Some of the test articles identified thus far are a solar vapor compression heat pump, 298</page><page sequence="298">200 1 -0 1 -2324-200 1-01-2332 composite coldplate shelves, prototypie cooling jackets, and various devices that utilize waste heat. 2001-01-2326. Deep space mission radiation shielding optim- ization. R. K. Tripathi and J. W. Wilson, NASA Langley Research Center; F. A. Cucinotta, NASA Johnson Space Center; J. E. Nealy, Old Dominion Univ. ; M. S. Clowdsley, National Research Council/ NASA Langley Research Center,; andM.-H. Y. Kim, College of Wil- liam and Mary. Providing protection against the hazards of space radiation is a major challenge to the exploration and development of space. The great cost of added radiation shielding is a potential limiting factor in deep space missions. In the present report, we present methods for optimized shield design over multi- segmented missions involv- ing multiple work and living areas in the transport and duty phase of lunar and Mars missions. The total shield mass over all pieces of equipment and habitats is optimized subject to career dose and dose rate constraints. 2001-01-2327. Neutron environment calculations for low earth orbit. M. S. Clowdsley, J. W. Wilson, and J. L. Shinn, NASA Langley Research Center; F. F. Badavi, Christopher Newport Univ.; J. H. Heinbockel, Old Dominion Univ.; and W. Atwell, Boe- ing North American, Inc. The long-term exposure of astronauts on the developing Interna- tional Space Station (ISS) requires an accurate knowledge of the internal exposure environment for human risk assessment and other onboard processes. The natural environment is moderated by the solar wind, which varies over the solar cycle. The HZETRN high charge and energy transport code developed at NASA Langley Research Center can be used to evaluate the neutron environment on ISS. A time dependent model for the ambient environment in low earth orbit is used. This model includes GCR radiation moderated by the Earth's magnetic field, trapped protons, and a recently com- pleted model of the albedo neutron environment formed through the interaction of galactic cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere. Using this code, the neutron environments for space shuttle missions were calculated and comparisons were made to measurements by the Johnson Space Center with onboard detectors. The models dis- cussed herein are being developed to evaluate the natural and induced environment data for the Intelligence Synthesis Environ- ment Project and eventual use in spacecraft optimization. 2001-01-2328. Anisotropic trapped proton effects on the International Space Station. William Atwell, Boeing Co. Most trapped proton effects studies assume a particle omni- directionality, while in reality the trapped particle environment is highly directional. This effect, called the 'East- West effect,' has been observed and measured on several Space Shuttle missions. Normally one assumes that the Shuttle flies at different attitudes during the course of the mission and the directionality effects get 'smeared out.' The International Space Station (ISS), however, will fly at a fixed attitude. Using the SPENVIS on-line capability and the anisotropic proton models of Badhwar-Konradi (B-K) and Watts (Vector Flux model: VF1), trapped proton differential spectra were generated for selected altitudes (51.6 deg inclination) for both solar minimum and maximum. Incorporating a particle transport code and a shielding model of the ISS, transmitted proton spectra can be com- puted as a function of shield thickness and polar and azimuthal angles ('look direction') for ISS habitable modules. These data allow one to identify thin regions where additional shielding may be located to minimize crew exposures. The directional results are compared with omnidirectional calculations. 2001-01-2329. Astronaut radiation exposures at selected loca- tions in the International Space Station. William Atwell, Boeing Co.; John Kern, Dynacs Corp.; and F. F. Badavi, Christopher New- port Univ. The bulk of the daily space radiation exposure to International Space Station astronauts will be received during times spent at selected locations. Using a recently updated and improved shielding model of the ISS, mass shielding distributions have been generated for these selected ISS locations. Anatomical math models have been developed for use in conjunction with spacecraft shielding models and space radiation dose codes to compute astronaut radiation expo- sures at the critical body organ level. In this paper we present a para- metric study of crew radiation exposures at several selected loca- tions, discuss the impact and effects on several mission scenarios, and present some ideas to further mitigate their exposures. 2001-01-2330. Worst case solar energetic particle events for deep space missions. Lawrence W. Townsend, Daniel L. Stephens, Jennifer L. Hoff, G. Scott Braley, and Hanna M. Moussa, University of Tennessee. Over the past two decades, various models of 'worst case' solar energetic particle event (SPE) spectra have been proposed in order to place an upper bound on the likely doses to critical body organs of astronauts on missions outside Earth's geomagnetic field. In this work, direct comparisons of organ dose estimates for various mod- els of 'worst case' SPE spectra are made by using the same transport code (BRYNTRN) and the same human geometry model (Comput- erized Anatomical Man). The calculations are made assuming nomi- nal thicknesses of spacecraft aluminum shielding. Discussions of possible acute exposure responses from these exposures are presented. 2001-01-2331. Radiation measurements at the International Space Station orbits. Gautam D. Badhwar, NASA Johnson Space Center. Construction of the International Space Station is now a reality with the start of permanent human presence. Radiation presents a serious risk to the health and safety of the astronauts with the clear requirement for estimating their exposures prior to and after the flight. Over the last few years, a tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) has been flown at a fixed mid-deck location onboard Shuttle flights in 51.65° inclination flights. These flights have provided data that covers the expected changes in the radiation exposure due to changes in altitude, and solar activity from the solar minimum to the solar maximum of the current 23rd solar cycle. Comparison with data acquired by a TEPC flown on the Mir has been made and shows excellent agreement. Based on this data, a simple function of the solar deceleration potential has been devel- oped to predict 90 days ahead of time of observations, the internal galactic cosmic radiation dose rate to ± 10% throughout the solar cycle. Asymmetry of trapped dose rates due to Shuttle orientation, consistent with earlier observations, is confirmed. The dose rate due to trapped particles is found to be a power law function of the atmo- spheric density, and within 10% of normalized trapped belt model predicted function. This relationship can be used to predict trapped dose rates to ± 10% four to twelve months prior to the time of obser- vation, depending upon the time in the solar cycle. Combined GCR plus trapped prediction capabilities are thus ±15%. The model has been used to predict the dose rates in the ISS Node 1 and R-16 ion chamber locations. 2001-01-2332. Development of the internal thermal control system (ITCS) for International Space Station (ISS). Vipul P. Patel, Richard Barido, and Brien Johnson, Honeywell Interna- tional; and Thomas Ibarra, Boeing. The International Space Station (ISS) internal thermal control system (ITCS) has been developed jointly by the Boeing Corpora- tion, Huntsville, Alabama, and Honeywell Engines &amp; Systems, Tor- rance, California, to meet ISS internal thermal control needs. The ITCS provides heat removal for the critical life support systems and thermal conditioning for numerous experiment racks. The ITCS will be fitted on a number of modules on the ISS. The first module, the 299</page><page sequence="299">2001-01-2332-2001-01-2338 US Laboratory Module, was launched in February 2001 and is now operational on the ISS. The dual-loop system is comprised of a low-temperature loop (LTL) and a moderate-temperature loop (MTL). Each loop has a pump package assembly (PPA), a system flow control assembly (SFCA), a three-way mixing valve (TWMV), several rack flow con- trol assemblies (RFCA), cold plates, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, a pump bypass assembly (PBA), and a heat exchanger. In addition, the MTL has an additional TWMV, a payload regeneration heat exchanger (P/RHE) and a manual flow control valve (MFCV). The LTL has a service performance and checkout unit (SPCU) heat exchanger. The two loops are linked via one loop crossover assem- bly (LCA) providing cross loop capabilities and a single-PPA two- loop functionality. Honeywell Engines &amp; Systems performed extensive qualifica- tion testing at the component level. The Boeing Company per- formed the system level qualification testing. Details of the system testing and verification are contained in paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2333. Development of an integrated design resolu- tion plan for the International Space Station active internal thermal control system coolant stability concerns. Robert S. Dougherty y Boeing Co.; and Joe P. ChamblisSy NASA Johnson Space Center. The International Space Station (ISS) Internal Active Thermal Control System (ITCS) for the United States Laboratory (USL), and follow-on pressurized elements, uses a mechanically-pumped fluid in closed-loop circuits. The ITCS utilizes a specifically formulated heat transfer fluid (essentially de-ionized water with special addi- tives). Silver ions are specified in the formulation to assist in the control of microorganisms. The potential for microorganisms to form biofilms known to cause heat transport, corrosion problems, and subsequent hardware deterioration has raised concerns among the ISS engineering community. This paper provides the integrated design resolution to: 1) ensure the coolant meets the required fluid specification; 2) obtain long- term 'fleet leader' data; 3) allow sampling of the ITCS coolant on- orbit; 4) return the coolant to the ground for complete chemical anal- yses including microbial parts count; and 5) add silver ions to the coolant stream(s) for on-orbit microbial growth control. 2001-01-2334. International Space Station internal thermal control system cold plate/fluid-stability test setup and prelimi- nary test results. C. D. Ray , NASA Marshall Space Flight Center ; and R. S. Dougherty, Boeing Co. This paper describes the internal thermal control system (ITCS) cold plate/fluid-stability test setup and summarizes the test results obtained to date. The test investigates ITCS-coolant stability and cold-plate debonding over time (3 years). The setup is consistent with flight materials, cleaning procedures, and loop-servicing proce- dures. The components include two flight cold plates, a qualification interface heat exchanger, qualification pump package assembly (PPA) gas trap and fluid filter, and a representative-length Teflon hose. A biofilm section of the test setup is included to evaluate long- term effects of microbial growth on representative ITCS materials. The flight-like test facility was developed at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) at the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) ITCS test facility. 2001-01-2335. Temperature controller stability resolution for ISS nodes 2&amp;3 IATCS loops. G. Valenzano, F. Burzagli, and S. Lombardi, Alenia Spazio. A typical feature of an active loop thermal system is to guarantee a tight temperature range to the users through stable and fast control dynamics. In this framework, Alenia Spazio developed a dedicated Temperature Control Loop Analyzer (TeCLA) as a tool to assess the suitability of the software controlled algorithm for International Space Station (ISS) Nodes 2&amp;3 water loops. This tool defines the stability regions as a function of the control law gains and allows the screening of the operative scenarios to identify the worst cases, thus reducing costs by drastically limiting the candidates for a verifi- cation-development test campaign. This paper presents the TeCLA features and its application on the active thermal control loops of ISS Nodes 2&amp;3. 2001-01-2336. Development and verification of an electrode system for electrolytic generation of silver ion biocide for the Space Station internal thermal control system fluid. H. E. Cole, D. D. Dees, J. L. Golden, R. S. Daugherty, N. E. Weir, S. Manuel, J. R. Keller, and S. S. Woodward, Boeing Space and Communica- tions Group. The Space Station Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS) fluid formulation is composed of a buffer solution consisting of a mixture of tri-sodium phosphate and sodium borate that produce a pH of approximately 9.5. A silver ion concentration is also specified in the formulation to assist in the control of microorganisms. The specifi- cation for the fluid places tight control on the allowed total organic carbon (TOC) concentration to further control possible food sources for microorganisms. Various ground tests conducted on the Labora- tory and Airlock modules have demonstrated that the TOC specifi- cation is hard to maintain in a test environment. Test data also dem- onstrate that silver ion depletes as it comes in contact with various metals in the ITCS loop. When the silver is depleted, the microorga- nism populations can rapidly increase to a range of 105 to 106 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 milliliter. The potential for microorganisms to form biofilms that are known to cause heat transport and corrosion problems has raised concern and initiated a search for a way to introduce silver ions into the ITCS loop. Electrolysis was chosen as a viable approach for con- tinuous slow injection of silver ion into the ITCS fluid. A silver electrode system has been developed and tested to dem- onstrate effectiveness for ITCS fluid. The electrode system control- ling circuit was designed to operate with pulsed polarity switching to minimize contamination buildup on the electrodes. A desired sil- ver generation rate is achieved by precise control of the voltage and circuit duty cycle. The data from this paper demonstrate the utility of the system for rapid 6-log reduction of large populations of microorganisms to less than detectable levels within 12 hours. 2001-01-2337. Preliminary assessment of microbial adhesion on the surface of materials from the ISS internal thermal con- trol system: Results of an accelerated 60-d study. M. R. Roman, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center; and O. J. Van Der Schijff, P. Macuch, and M. W. Mitte Iman, Altran Corp. The internal thermal control system (ITCS) in the International Space Station (ISS) is a closed loop that circulates an aqueous fluid that provides a constant temperature coolant supply to the equip- ment, payloads, and the avionics loop. The ITCS fluid was formu- lated to perform this function without compromising the health of the crew in the unlikely event of a leak into the cabin. It was also designed to control the microbial population by maintaining a high pH (approximately 9.4), limiting the amount of total organic carbon (&lt;5 ppm), and using silver (approximately 2 ppm) as a biocide. A flight-like test facility for conducting a 3-year study was developed by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to simulate the conditions in the ISS moderate temperature ITCS. The 3-year study, begun in August 2000, will provide information about the long-term effects of microbial growth on representative ITCS material. 2001-01-2338. Concept studies of a ceramic engine heat shield for RLV application. Wolfgang P. P. Fischer, Ulrich Tra- bandt, and Wilke Zeiss, Astrium GmbH. Based on the heritage of carbidic Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) applied for hot structures and thermal protection systems on re-entry vehicles, Astrium SI has developed alumina-fiber- reinforced CMC systems (oxide ceramic) which do not require oxi- dation resistant coatings in atmospheric environment at high tem- 300</page><page sequence="300">2001-01-2338-2001-01-2343 peratures. As most launch vehicle configurations require in the vicinity of the rocket engine a thermal protection due to the impact of base heating their is a need to incorporate an adequate engine heat shield assembly. For the application on future RLV's this engine heat shield has also to be designed for reusability. Compared to the state-of-the-art systems the envisaged CMC heat shield concept provides high mass saving potential which improves significantly the position of the center of gravity of further space transportation systems. Therefore Astrium SI has proposed a promising ceramic concept which is currently further developed within the frame of the national German program TETRA. After a general feasibility study per- formed during last year the detailed development has been started. First tasks were to establish a generic requirements specification and to carry out a trade-off for different design concepts. As a first step the engine heat shield development aims to a veri- fication of the major capabilities on a flight demonstrator. For that reason the HOPPER RLV concept currently under development has been selected as reference configuration. Major challenges of the engine heat shield project will be the design and manufacturing of large 3-dimensional structures using oxide CMC and to provide a sealing system which prevents high temperature gas flows entering the heat shield inner compartment and allow on the other hand for sufficient venting capability during ascent and re-entry mission phases. For the heat shield design it is essential to know besides other requirements (e.g., mechanical loads) especially the aerothermal environment in which such a heat shield shall be operated. For this reason first aerodynamic analyses have been performed to gather information about flow/temperature/pressure distribution in the vicinity of the heat shields. This paper describes concept studies of an oxide-ceramic-based engine heat shield as well as the results of the analytical work per- formed so far. 2001-01-2339. Design of thermal radiative properties of mul- tilayer films on a variable emittance radiator. Kazunori Shi- mazaki, Keio Univ.; Sumitaka Tachikawa and Akira Ohnishi , Insti- tute of Space and Astronautical Science ; and Yuji Nagasaka , Keio Univ. New thermal control material named Smart Radiation Device (SRD) has been studied to apply for spacecraft. Infrared radiative properties of the SRD change depending on its own temperature without electrical or mechanical instruments. The SRD however shows too high solar absorptance to apply it as a radiator. To over- come such drawback, it is necessary to design and apply the mutilayer films on the SRD for reflecting solar radiation, keeping infrared radiative properties of the SRD. To perform optimum design of the multilayer films, the genetic algorithm (GA) was employed. In this paper, we propose a design of the thermal radia- tive properties of the SRD with the multilayer films. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2340. Mathematical analysis of space radiator seg- menting for increased reliability and reduced mass. Albert J. Juhasz, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Spacecraft for long-duration deep space missions will need to be designed to survive micrometeoroid bombardment of their surfaces some of which may actually be punctured. To avoid loss of the entire mission the damage due to such punctures must be limited to small, localized areas. This is especially true for power system radi- ators, which necessarily feature large surface areas to reject heat at relatively low temperature to the space environment by thermal radi- ation. It may be intuitively obvious, that if a space radiator is com- posed of a large number of independently operating segments, such as heat pipes, a random micrometeoroid puncture will result only in the loss of the punctured segment, and not the entire radiator. Due to the redundancy achieved by independently operating segments, the wall thickness and consequently the weight of such segments can be drastically reduced. Probability theory is used to estimate the magnitude of such weight reductions as the number of segments is increased. An analysis of relevant parameter values required for minimum mass segmented radiators is also included. 2001-01-2341. Development of loop heat pipe déployable radiator for use on Engineering Test Satellite VIII (ETS-VIII). Hiroaki Ishikawa , Akira Yao, Teturou Ogushi, and Seiji Haga , Mit- subishi Electric Corporation (MELCO); and Akihiro Miy asaka, and Hiroyuki Nöda , National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASD A). This paper presents a design of déployable radiator and engineer- ing model test for ETS-VIII (Engineering Test Satellite VIII). ETS- VIII will be launched in 2003, which establishes and verifies an advanced 3 -ton-class spacecraft bus and an advanced communica- tion technology via satellite. Developed déployable radiator uses LHP (Loop Heat Pipe) whose reservoir is embedded in an evapora- tor (RELHP) and wick is 0.5 micron fine pore radius stainless steel. Further, CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) face-skin with high thermal conductive graphite fiber is used for panel face-skin to reduce panel thickness as well as the panel weight. Thin panel is necessary to reduce stowed panel space. RELHP (Reservoir Embed- ded Loop Heat Pipe) condenser, aluminum alloy channel, is embed- ded in the CFRP face-skin radiator panel. Further, engineering model test of the developed déployable radiator has already fin- ished. Deployment, thermal performance, vibration, acoustic and thermal vacuum/balance test, has been carried out successfully. Fur- thermore, analytical results were compared with thermal balance test. Analytical results have good agreement with tested results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2342. Smart radiation device: Design of an intelli- gent material with variable emittance. Sumitaka Tachikawa and Akira Ohnishi , Institute of Space and Astronautical Science ; Kazu- nori Shimazaki, Keio Univ.; and Akira Okamoto, Yasuyuki Naka- mura, Yuichi Shimakawa, Toru Mori, and Atsushi Ochi, NEC Corp. Variable emittance radiator, called SRD, is a thin and light ceramic tile whose infrared emissivity is varied proportionally by its own temperature. Bonded only to the external surface of space- crafts, it controls the heat radiated to deep space without electrical or mechanical parts such as the thermal louver. By applying this new device for thermal control of spacecrafts, considerable weight and cost reductions can be achieved easily. In this paper, the new design and the new manufacturing process of the SRD and its optical properties, such as the total hemispherical emittance and the solar absorptance, are described. By introducing this new design and manufacturing process, the weight of the SRD is easily decreased, keeping its strength and the optical properties. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2343. X-38 nose skirt panels - Results of qualifica- tion testing. Ulrich Trabandt and Wolfgang P. P. Fischer, Astrium SI Bremen. The X-38 vehicle will be used to demonstrate the future technol- ogy on durable TPS for the CRV. Astrium has produced two large CMC Nose Skirt side panels for the current X-38 configuration. The design of the 3-dimensional curved and large side panels comprises a light-weight, stringer stiffened concept which compen- sates the thermal expansion by a system of flexible metallic stand- offs. An optimum in flexibility and stiffness to fulfill all require- ments had to be found: strong and stiff enough to carry the thermo- mechanical loads, but flexible enough to realize a fastening concept which does not fail due to thermal expansion. The fastening concept has been tested on development test level. Some thermal and mechanical tests on sub-structure level confirmed the design and analysis work of the complete TPS concept. The ther- mal and vibration qualification tests have been carried out success- fully with a complete nose assembly qualification model, compris- ing the nose tip cold structure, the CMC nose cap, the two large nose 301</page><page sequence="301">2001-01-2343-2001-01-2350 skirt side panels and the small CMC chin panel. The vibration tests on a single side panel and the complete nose assembly have been successfully performed too. The flight hardware, a complete set of pre-assembled Nose Assembly has been delivered already to NASA for Integration on the X-38 V201. 2001-01-2344. Incineration of inedible biomass in a regenera- tive life support system - Update of development activities at ARC. John Fisher , NASA Ames Research Center; Suresh Pisharody and Mark Moran , Lockheed Martin Space Operations ; and Maher Tleimat, Water Reuse Technology. Of the many competing technologies for resource recovery from solid wastes for long-duration manned missions such as a lunar or Mars base, incineration technology is one of the most promising and certainly the most well developed in a terrestrial sense. Various factors are involved in the design of an optimum fluid- ized bed incinerator for inedible biomass. The factors include vari- ability of moisture in the biomass, the ash content, and the amount of fuel nitrogen in the biomass. The crop mixture in the waste will vary; consequently the nature of the waste, the nitrogen content, and the biomass heating values will vary as well. Variation in feed will result in variation in the amount of contaminants such as nitrogen oxides that are produced in the combustion part of the incinerator. The incinerator must be robust enough to handle this variability. Research at NASA Ames Research Center using the fluidized bed incinerator has yielded valuable data on system parameters and vari- ables. In the last year, process modifications were carried out to improve the energy efficiency and the contaminant cleanup of the existing fluidized bed incinerator. An experimental evaluation of the power usage and the catalytic cleanup by the system was conducted. 2001-01-2345. Fundamental study of solid waste size reduc- tion as applied to crewed space missions. George M. Savage and Luis F. Diaz, CalRecovery , Inc. This study is directed toward the analysis of size reduction as a means of processing solid waste for resource recovery during long- duration, crewed space missions. Currently, there is a lack of basic performance information related to the size reduction of solid waste generated by such missions. This study consisted of designing, con- structing, and testing size reduction equipment and of measuring the performance of the equipment. Key operating conditions and perfor- mance parameters were measured during the research project. Trash, biomass residues, and their combination were used as feedstocks and size reduced under varying conditions of grinder rotational speed and size of the discharge opening, among other conditions. A number of performance parameters were measured and calculated during the study, including the specific energy required for reducing waste to various product sizes. Additionally, the study provides practical information related to the volume, mass, and resource requirements for size reduction of waste in crewed space applica- tions, and to potential processing problems. 2001-01-2347. Life support applications of TCM-FC technol- ogy. A. E. S. Green , J. P. Mullin , G. P. Schaefer , W. Zhang , N. A. Chancy, and M. S. Sankar, University of Florida. Thermo-chemical-mechanical (TCM) feedstock conversion (FC) systems originally developed for high-temperature conversion of domestic solid feedstock or blends to useful liquid and gaseous fuels are examined for advanced life support (ALS) applications in space- craft. Recently, exploratory investigations with these TCM-FC sys- tems to use or sequester CO2 have led also to a focus on the produc- tion of useful chemicals and chars (activated carbon, humâtes, CO2 scrubbers, chelating and detoxifying agents, etc). TCM systems can process solid blends with catalysts, adsorbants, reactants, carbon dioxide, steam, air, oxygen, natural gas and liquids. This study con- siders applications of CCTL's laboratory scale TCM-FCs for the conversion of the solid waste into sterile and useful gases, liquids or chars on long space missions. TCM units are extrusion systems, and are more adaptable to zero gravity than fluidized bed systems or other systems that rely on gravity. The fact that TCM systems can process solid waste in minutes whereas biochemical conversion requires weeks should be advantageous when time is important. Unfortunately the current lack of understanding of the fundamental pyrolysis processes of biomass or coal combustion or gasification/ liquification is a major impediment to the design of optimum ther- mo-chemical systems. This paper seeks systematics in the yields of products from the pyrolysis of materials consisting mainly of car- bon, hydrogen and oxygen. The intent is to provide a broad base that could support many applications including ALS systems. 2001-01-2348. Lyophilization for water recovery. Eric Litwil- ler and Martin Reinhard, Stanford Univ.; and Michael Flynn and John Fisher, NASA Ames Research Center. An energy-efficient lyophilization technique is being developed to recover water from highly contaminated spacecraft waste streams. In the lyophilization process, water in an aqueous waste is frozen and then sublimed, separating the waste into a dried solid material and liquid water. This technology is ideally suited to appli- cations such as the Mars Reference Mission, where water recovery rates approaching 100% are desirable but production of CO2 is not. Candidate wastes include feces, concentrated brines from water pro- cessors, and other solid wastes that contain water. To operate in microgravity, and to minimize power consumption, thermoelectric heat pumps can be used in place of traditional fluid cycle heat pumps. A mathematical model of a thermoelectric lyophilizer is described and used to generate energy use and processing rate estimates. 2001-01-2349. A prototype pyrolyzer for solid waste resource recovery in space. Michael A. Serio, Erik Kroo, Rosemary Bas- silakis, and Marek A. Wojtowicz, Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.; and Eric M. Suuberg, Brown Univ. Pyrolysis processing is one of several options for solid waste resource recovery in space. It has the advantage of being relatively simple and adaptable to a wide variety of feedstocks and it can pro- duce several usable products from typical waste streams. The objec- tive of this study is to produce a prototype mixed solid waste pyro- lyzer for spacecraft applications. A two-stage reactor system was developed which can process about 1 kg of waste per cycle. The reactor includes a pyrolysis chamber where the waste is heated to temperatures above 600°C for primary pyrolysis. The volatile prod- ucts (liquids, gases) are transported by a N2 purge gas to a second chamber which contains a catalyst bed for cracking the tars at tem- peratures of about 1000°C - 1100°C. The tars are cracked into car- bon and additional gases. Most of the carbon is subsequently gas- ified by oxygenated volatiles (CO2, H2O) from the first stage. In a final step, the temperature of the first stage can be raised and the purge gas switched from N2 to CO2 in order to gasify the remaining char in the first stage and the remaining carbon deposits in the sec- ond stage. Alternatively, the char can be removed from the first stage and saved as a future source of CO2 or used to make activated carbon. The product gases from the pyrolyzer will be rich in CO and cannot be vented directly into the cabin. However, they can be pro- cessed in a shift reactor or sent to a high-temperature fuel cell. A control system based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) is being developed for the reactor system. ANN models are well suited to describing the complicated relationships between the composition of the starting materials, the process conditions and the desired product yields. 2001-01-2350. Potential for recovery of plant macronutrients from space habitat wastes for salad crop production. Kanapathipillai Wignarajah, Suresh Pisharody, and Mark Moran, Lockheed Martin Space Mission Systems and Services ; and John Fisher, NASA Ames Research Center. 302</page><page sequence="302">2001-01-2350-2001-01-2358 Crop production in space habitats is currently under consider- ation as part of an advanced life support system. The scenarios for crop production vary depending on the mission objectives. For a mission scenario such as the International Space Station (ISS), cur- rent efforts propose only salad crop production. However in order to grow salad crops, there is a need for plant nutrients (elements) such as N, P, K, Ca, etc., which constitutes about 10% of dry weight of the plant. Nitrogen and potassium are the major elements needed by salad crops and currently require resupply on Station. However, it is feasible that these macronutrients could be recovered through the waste materials generated by the crew. The proposed concepts are non-oxidative and simple in design. This paper considers the potential for reclaiming macronutrients from urine and gray water concentrates from water recovery sys- tems. The potential gains from reducing resupply from use of urine and gray water concentrates are listed. A detailed discussion of the processing means to recover the nutrients is given. 2001-01-2351. Solids waste processing and resource recovery for long-duration missions - A workshop. Charles Verostko, Lib- erated Staffing Services, Inc.; Michael Alazraki, Lockheed Martin Space Operations; Jitendra Joshi, Universities Space Research Association ; and John Fisher, Ames Research Center. Future long-duration human space exploration missions will require increased system autonomy and reliability with fidelities beyond the present level of life support technology. Long-duration planetary missions will require Advanced Life Support (ALS) sys- tems to provide methods for crop and food production, air and water recycling, and solid waste resource recovery. Among these principal life support functional areas, solid waste processing will need signif- icant development. Because of this need, a solid waste processing and resource recovery (SWPRR) workshop was held in April 2000, to assess solid waste processing technologies. The purpose of the workshop was to gather data and provide input to the National Aero- nautics and Space Administration (NASA) for a solid waste process- ing research and technology development (R&amp;TD) strategy. This paper discusses the workshop assessment methodology and the results. The workshop was divided into four functional compo- nents of solid waste processing: 1) pre-processing, 2) physicochemi- cal primary processing, 3) biological primary processing, and 4) post-treatment technologies. Prior to developing the technology assessment methodology, five potential Mars mission scenarios were assumed. These Mars scenarios ranged from transit vehicle to extended Martian base. Waste models detailing the quantity and quality of waste components expected for specific mission scenario elements were then established. Technology assessments were based on the waste model developed for each scenario. Technology assessments included identifying technology strengths and limita- tions in the context of the assumed NASA missions and highlighting possible approaches to overcome any limitations. Thirty-two candidate solid waste processing technologies were independently assessed using established parameters and criteria such as Equivalent System Mass (ESM), technology readiness levels (TRLs), reliability, use of expendables, and operational gravi- tational dependence performance needs. 2001-01-2354. Investigation into the performance of mem- brane separator technologies used in the International Space Station regenerative life support systems: Results and lessons learned. Donald W. Holder, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center; and Edward W. O'Connor, John Zagaja, and Karen Murdoch, Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International Inc. The Volatile Removal Assembly Flight Experiment (VRAFE) was performed in May of 1999, on board Shuttle Flight STS-96 to support the development of the International Space Station (ISS) Water Recovery System (WRS). The objective of this experiment was to address concerns in the performance of a two-phase, catalytic reactor in a microgravity environment. During the experiment, an unexpected finding was discovered when the VRAFE Gas/Liquid Separator (GLS) failed to separate gas from the reactor outlet stream. The VRAFE GLS was a two-membrane (flat sheet hydro- phobic and hydrophilic membrane) gas trap. Flight data as well as the post-flight failure investigation determined that the GLS hydro- phobic membrane failed as a result of very fine hydrophilic catalyst particles from the VRAFE reactor that had contaminated the surface of the hydrophobic membrane. These particles allowed a water layer to wick across the surface of the hydrophobic membrane and effec- tively block the pores from passing gas. Microgravity magnified the failure effect since there was no gravity to free drain the water layer from the hydrophobic membrane. Though this GLS design was not the VRA flight design, a hydro- phobic membrane separator is used in the VRA and other membrane separators are used throughout the ISS life support systems. As a result of the GLS failure, an assessment of all the membrane separa- tors in the water recycling and oxygen generation systems was per- formed to determine if membrane separation was acceptable in each application. This paper summarizes the results and lessons learned from this investigation. 2001-01-2355. Water recovery and urine collection in the ser- vice module of the International Space Station. N. M. Samsonov, L. S. Bobe, V. M. Novikov, N. S. Farafonov, and V. A. Soloukhin, NIICHIMMASH; S. Ju. Romanov, P. O. Andrejchuk, N. N. Protasov, and N. A. Koledov, RSC Energia; and Ju. E. Sinjak, and V. M. Skuratov, IMBP. The paper deals with the construction and performance data of the service module Zvezda water supply system of the International Space Station (ISS). The performance data at an initial phase of manned station functioning are provided. The data on humidity con- densate and recovered water composition are reviewed. The water supply and demand balance are analyzed. The effective cooperation of international partners on part of water supply for the crew is shown. 2001-01-2357. Development of a membrane-based gas-liquid separator for the Space Station water processor. Catherine Thi- baud-Erkey, Anthony Lanzarone, Adam Lurie, and Doug Snowdon, Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc.; and K. S. Cheng, Millipore Corp. The Water Processor developed for the International Space Sta- tion includes a high-temperature catalytic reactor that utilizes oxy- gen gas to oxidize dissolved chemicals. The effluent from the reac- tor is a mixture of gases (O2, CO2, N2) and hot water. Since the crew has requested that drinking water does not contain any free gas at body temperature (37.8° ?C or 100°F), a phase separator operating at elevated temperatures is required downstream of the catalytic reactor. For this application, Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems Inter- national (HSSSI) has developed a passive Gas Liquid Separator (GLS) that relies on a positive barrier - a membrane - to extract the free gas from the inlet two-phase mixture. The membrane selected is a hollow fiber hydrophobic asymmetric membrane with pore size in the ultra-filtration range. This paper outlines the challenges in both design and operation that were overcome during the development of this device. 2001-01-2358. Life support equivalent system mass predic- tions for the Mars Dual Lander Reference Mission. Michael K. Ewert, NASA Johnson Space Center; Alan E. Drysdale, Boeing Co.; Anthony J. Hanford, Lockheed Martin ; and Julie Levri, NASA Ames Research Center. The Systems Integration, Modeling and Analysis (SIMA) ele- ment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Advanced Life Support (ALS) Project conducts on-going studies to determine the most efficient means of achieving a human mission to Mars. Life support for the astronauts constitutes an extremely important part of the mission and will undoubtedly add significant mass, power, volume, cooling and crew time require- 303</page><page sequence="303">2001-01-2358-2001-01-2362 ments to the mission. Equivalent system mass (ESM) is the sum of these five parameters on an equivalent mass basis and can be used to identify potential ways to reduce the overall cost of the mission. SIMA has documented several reference missions in enough detail to allow quantitative studies to identify optimum ALS archi- tectures. The Mars Dual Lander Mission, under consideration by the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Exploration Office, is one of those mis- sions. This mission requires three vehicles: a Mars Transit Vehicle that carries the crew between Earth and Mars orbit, a Mars Descent/ Ascent Lander that carries the crew between Mars orbit and the Martian Surface, and a Surface Habitat Lander that houses the crew for a 600-day stay on the surface of Mars. The life support system includes six subsystems, Air, Biomass, Food, Thermal, Waste, and Water, as well as several important external interfaces. Although an optimum life support system con- figuration for this mission is not yet evident, one 'straw man' archi- tecture has been analyzed using the ESM method. This identifies which subsystems have the greatest 'cost' for this mission and helps determine where technology investments will be the most effective at reducing this cost. 2001-01-2359. The cost and equivalent system mass of space crew time. Harry W. Jones , NASA Ames Research Center. In 'Theory and Application of the Equivalent System Mass Met- ric,' Levri, Vaccari, and Drysdale computed the Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of crew time. ESM is a cost-type metric based on allo- cated mass that is often used in life support systems. The previous paper suggested that the cost per hour of crew time should be equal to the ESM of the life support system, divided by the number of available crew work hours. We suggest here that the mass cost for additional crew time may be as large as the total mission mass or as small as the added mass of consumables, depending on how much more crew time is needed. If the increased mission work load requires flying additional crewmembers, the total mass and cost of the mission increases roughly proportionally to crew size. But if the needed work can be done merely by extending the mission duration, the required additional mass is only that of the food and supplies to be consumed during the time extension. The resulting upper and lower bounds on cost per hour of crew time are within an order of magnitude and can help resolve design decisions even when the total demand for crew time is unknown. However, the cost of crew time used in mission planning should not always be the actual cost to pro- vide that time. The cost should be set at a level that ensures that the crew is neither under or overloaded. If little work is needed, we should set the price of crew time low or at zero to encourage more tasks. If the crew time demand is excessive, the cost should be set high to reduce the task requests. Imposing a low cost for low total demand and high for high will help guide the sum of crew time requests to converge to the desired workload. 2001-01-2360. The potential for reducing the weight of a Martian greenhouse. Vadim Ye. Rygalov and Ray A. Bucklin, Uni- versity of Florida ; Alan E. Drysdale , Boeing; Philip A. Fowler, Dynamac Corporation ; and Raymond M. Wheeler, NASA Kennedy Space Center. Use of the local resources on Mars could reduce the cost of life support significantly. Theoretically, Closed Ecological Systems (CES) isolated from surroundings and functioning on the basis of a closed cycle of matter transformation are the most reliable systems for life support in open space or on the surface of non-terrestrial bodies such as the Moon or Mars. But these systems require a rela- tively high initial mass (which is a critical factor in space flight) in comparison to supply-based systems. In addition CESs are a useful scientific abstraction though they have never been reached in reality. To minimize the cost of life support on Mars, we need to find scenarios and technologies such as a Martian Greenhouse (MG) which are based on use of the planet's indigenous sources of energy and materials (natural illumination, carbon dioxide, water, nutrient elements for plants in the planetary soil). Our initial analysis shows that such approaches are possible and cost effective. The mass of supplies associated with the biological part of life support in a MG could probably be reduced to a few percent compared to a com- pletely closed system for Martian conditions. This reduction does not apply to the physical shell and crop support equipment, which will remain practically the same for different kinds of scenarios and systems and determined mainly the physical conditions on Mars (gravitation, atmosphere, radiation, etc.). Realization of these so-called resource-oriented scenarios requires development of technologies for MG functioning such as collection of carbon dioxide, separation and concentration of oxy- gen, accumulation of natural water, treatment of the soil, design of enclosures, light utilization, automation/ control, and others. We also need to investigate the physiological limits of higher plants at low temperatures, illumination, atmospheric pressure, humidity and probably other conditions. There will be costs associated with using Martian resources. However, existing work, e.g., at NASA ARC suggests that the benefits will greatly exceed the costs. In conclusion the most effective way to reduce the mass of the MG is through a balanced approach including MG engineering design, limits of plant physiology, greenhouse and environment interaction and In Situ Resources Utilization (ISRU). 2001-01-2361. Modeling separate and combined atmospheres in BIO-Plex. Harry Jones and Cory Finn, NASA Ames Research Center ; Xianmin Kwauk, Sverdrup Technology; and Charles Black- well, Lockheed Martin Engineering and Sciences. We modeled BIO-Plex designs with separate or combined atmo- spheres and then simulated controlling the atmosphere composition. The BIO-Plex is the Bioregenerative Planetary Life Support Sys- tems Test Complex, a large regenerative life support test facility under development at NASA Johnson Space Center. Although plants grow better at above-normal carbon dioxide levels, humans can tolerate even higher carbon dioxide levels. Incin- erator exhaust has very high levels of carbon dioxide. An elaborate BIO-Plex design would maintain different atmospheres in the crew and plant chambers and isolate the incinerator exhaust in the airlock. This design option easily controls the crew and plant carbon dioxide levels but it uses many gas processors, buffers, and controllers. If all the crew's food is grown inside BIO-Plex, all the carbon dioxide required by the plants can be supplied by crew respiration and the incineration of plant and food waste. Because the oxygen mass flow must balance in a closed loop, the plants supply all the oxygen required by the crew and the incinerator. Using plants for air revitalization allows using fewer gas processors, buffers, and controllers. In the simplest design, a single combined atmosphere was used for the crew, the plant chamber, and the incinerator. All gas proces- sors, buffers, and controllers were eliminated. The carbon dioxide levels were necessarily similar for the crew and plants. If most of the food is grown, carbon dioxide can be controlled at the desired level by scheduling incineration. An intermediate design uses one atmosphere for the crew and incinerator chambers and a second for the plant chamber. This allows different carbon dioxide levels for the crew and plants. Better control of the atmosphere is obtained by varying the incineration rate. Less gas processing, storage, and control is needed if more food is grown. Using plants for air revitalization allows reducing physicochemi- cal processing, buffering, and control. Tests of optimized one or two atmosphere designs would be significant missions for BIO-Plex. 2001-01-2362. Life support trade studies involving plants. Alan E. Drysdale, Boeing Co. Plants can be grown in space to support human life, providing food, and regenerating water and air. Various groups have demon- strated that plants can support human life on the ground, and that plants can grow in space. One would suppose that plants are also able to support human life in space, though obviously it would be 304</page><page sequence="304">200 1 -0 1 -2362-200 1 -0 1 -2366 a good idea to demonstrate that ability before committing to a mis- sion requiring bioregeneration. However, plant growth in space requires that we provide the necessary conditions for growth, and this might require not only providing water and fertilizer as we do in terrestrial agriculture, but also a controlled environment and light- ing. This would make crops much more costly than we are accus- tomed to on Earth, where the majority of crops are grown outside and where natural sunlight is generally adequate. On the other hand, providing food, air, and water in space by any other means is also costly. The real question is whether and under what conditions it is cost effective to grow plants for life support in space. There are also intangible benefits in growing crops, and these need to be consid- ered in designing a mission, though it is difficult to assess their importance. For simplicity, this paper uses a quantitative approach, and ignores, for now, intangible benefits. Cost effectiveness can be calculated for identified products and for a given mission where fac- tors such as mission duration, equipment design, and mission equiv- alencies can be specified. Equivalent system mass (ESM) has been calculated for a number of plant products both for supply from Earth and for local produc- tion on Mars. A dimensionless number is then obtained by dividing the supply ESM by the local-production ESM. This 'goodness' number will be greater than one when local production is cost effec- tive. Very different values of goodness are obtained according to the plant product for which the value is estimated. Thus, fresh tomatoes turn out to be worth more than dried tomatoes. This is probably real- istic, as fresh tomatoes would cost more to ship, even if they could arrive in pristine condition (which, of course, is not the case). Fur- thermore, drying locally grown tomatoes would cost more in equip- ment, energy, and heat rejection, and probably in crew time, than the fresh product, so locally produced dried tomatoes would cost more per kg of usable product than fresh tomatoes. A correction can be applied to account for benefits of water and air regeneration, based on the reduced water and air systems that are needed when plants are grown. Thus, air regeneration would not be needed if the degree of food closure exceeds about 50%. However, gas storage, air circulation, and other functions would still be needed. With water, if it is accepted that plants can be used for pro- ducing potable water (and not everybody agrees with this due to concerns over pathogens and contaminants), functions such as stor- age and distribution would still be needed, but water closure would be reached at about 20% food closure. For simplicity, this correction has not been applied here Goodness is considered for a number of crops products and a number of assumptions, using a baseline of terrestrial growth- chamber productivity, Mars surface missions of variable durations, and established equivalencies. 2001-01-2363. Practical scheduling considerations of waste heat reuse for a Mars mission advanced life support system. Julie A. Levri and Cory K. Finn, NASA Ames Research Center. This paper builds on a steady-state investigation of waste heat reuse in an Advanced Life Support System (ALSS) for a Mars mis- sion with a low degree of crop growth. In past studies, such a system has been defined in terms of technology types, hot and cold stream identification and stream energy content. The maximum steady-state potential for power and cooling savings within the system was com- puted via the Pinch Method. In this paper, the next step is taken toward achieving a pragmatic estimate of costs and savings associ- ated with waste heat reuse in terms of equivalent system mass (ESM). In this paper, the assumption of steady-state flows are discarded, and a proposed schedule is developed for activities that are of inter- est in terms of waste heat reuse. The advanced life support system for the Mars Dual Lander Transit Vehicle is the system of interest. Based upon results of previous applications of the Pinch Method, stream matches are suggested and the time dependence of hot and cold stream existence within the system are discussed. 2001-01-2364. Food system trade study for an early Mars mission. Julie Levri , NASA Ames Research Center; Michael Ewert and Vickie Kloeris, NASA Johnson Space Center ; Michele Per - chonok, National Space Biomedical Research Institute; Laurie Peterson, Lockheed Martin Space Operations; Beverly Swango and Mary E. Toerne, SPACEHAB, Inc.; and Elena Vittadini, NASA Johnson Space Center and the University of Houston. In preparation for future planetary exploration, the Bioregenera- tive Planetary Life Support Systems Test Complex (BIO-Plex) is currently being built at the NASA Johnson Space Center. The BIO- Plex facility will allow for closed chamber Earth-based tests. Vari- ous prepackaged food systems are being considered for the first 120- day BIO-Plex test. These food systems will be based on the Shuttle Training Menu and the International Space Station (ISS) Assembly Complete food systems. This paper evaluates several prepackaged food system options for the surface portion of an early Mars mis- sion, based on plans for the first BIO-Plex test. The five systems considered are listed. The food system options are assessed using equivalent system mass (ESM), which evaluates each option based upon the mass, volume, power, cooling and crewtime requirements. The work presented in this paper is a portion of a larger investiga- tion, which includes a discussion of qualitative attributes that are not elucidated through ESM evaluation. 2001-01-2365. Assessment of waste processing technologies for 3 missions. Sabrina Maxwell and Alan E. Drysdale, Boeing Co. Choosing the best approach to meet waste processing require- ments for long-duration space missions should be based on objective selection criteria that provide for subsystem operational availability at the lowest mission cost. Suitable criteria would include robust- ness, safety, and the minimization of mass, volume, power, cooling, crew time, and resupply requirements for the candidate technolo- gies. The best candidate technologies based on data from historical missions and preliminary data from the Solid Waste Processing and Resource Recovery Workshop (SWPRRW) have been evaluated for cost effectiveness in processing crew waste loads as defined by identified waste models. Both PC and biological approaches were considered for each of three missions: the ISS mission, a Mars tran- sit mission, and a 'concentrated exploration' mission for the Mars surface. Results of this analysis are consistent for all three missions con- sidered. For ISS (10-years) and Mars transit (0.49-years each way), both PC and supply-based missions, the storage of waste was the most cost-effective approach. For the 'concentrated exploration' mission, which assumes one plant growth chamber and a 1 .64-year surface stay, storage was also the most cost-effective option, but other processes, including sterilization for planetary protection may need to be included. 2001-01-2366. The definition of space life support system pre- liminary configuration based on a single criteria approach. N. M. Samsonov, E. A. Kurmazenko, E. V. Menkin, L. I. Gavrilov, and N. S. Farafonov, NIICHIMMASH. This paper reviews the preliminary definition of integrated life support system configurations based on a single criterion decision- making task (SCDMT). Comparative analysis results are shown for currently used effec- tiveness models based on SCDMT. Possible areas of application for those models are determined. It is also proven that well-known effectiveness model, which uses an equivalent mass approach to determine system expenditures, can be used only in cases where useful effect from system operation is the same. The article proposes the use of a global thermodynamic effec- tiveness criterion based on the exergy method to account for ECLSS functional expenditures, i.e., functional costs. Exergy is a concept that fuses energy and material quality information in a measure that is both descriptive and physically significant. This method accounts for nonequivalence of different forms of energy and allows measur- 305</page><page sequence="305">200 1 -0 1 -2366-200 1 -0 1 -2372 ing technological flows in the system using same measuring units. Technological flows is a general term, that includes all mass, power, data, etc., flows in the system. The paper shows the results of single criteria evaluation of both biological and physical/chemical advanced ECLSS and points out the necessity to account for the uncertainty in initial information for accurate problem solution. 2001-01-2367. Collaborative engineering methods for radia- tion shield design. R. C. Singleterry , Jr., G. D. Quails, J. W. Wilson, F. M. Cheatwood, and J. O. Riggins, NASA Langley Research Cen- ter; K. Y. Fan and B. D. Johns, Swales Aerospace; M. S. Clowdsley, NRC ; M. Y. Kim, William and Mary; S. L. Koontz and F. A. Cuci- notta, NASA Johnson Space Center ; W. Atwell, Boeing Co.; F. F. Badavi, Christopher Newport Univ.; and S. A. Kay ali, NASA Jet Propulsion Lab. The hazards of ionizing radiation in space continue to be a limit- ing factor in the design of spacecraft and habitats. Shielding against such hazards adds to the mission costs and is even an enabling tech- nology in human exploration and development of space. We are developing a web accessible system for radiation hazard evaluation in the design process. The framework for analysis and collaborative engineering is used to integrate mission trajectory, environmental models, craft materials and geometry, system radiation response functions, and mission requirements for evaluation and optimization of shielding distribution and materials. Emphasis of the first version of this integrated design system will address low Earth orbit allow- ing design system validation using STS, Mir, and ISS measure- ments. The second version will include Mars, lunar, and other deep space mission analysis. It will also include the capability to perform shielding optimization including shield materials, mission sequence, and propulsion trade studies. The third version will include deep space probe design capability. 2001-01-2368. Shuttle spacesuit (radiation) model develop- ment. Brooke M. Anderson, George Washington Univ. ; J. E. Nealy, Old Dominion Univ.; G. D. Quails, P. J. Staritz, and J. W. Wilson, NASA Langley Research Center; M.-H. Y. Kim, College of William and Mary; F. A. Cucinotta, NASA Johnson Space Center ; W. Atwell, Boeing Co.; G. De Angelis, NASA Langley Research Center &amp; Isti- tuto Superiore di Sanità; and J. Ware, and A. E. Persans, ILC Dover. A detailed spacesuit computational model is being developed at the Langley Research Center for exposure evaluation studies. The details of the construction of the spacesuit are critical to an estimate of exposures and for assessing the health risk to the astronaut during extra- vehicular activity (EVA). Fine detail of the basic fabric struc- ture, helmet, and backpack is required to assure a valid evaluation. The exposure fields within the Computerized Anatomical Male (CAM) and Female (CAF) are evaluated at 148 and 156 points, respectively, to determine the dose fluctuations within critical organs. Exposure evaluations for ambient environments will be given and potential implications for geomagnetic storm conditions discussed. 2001-01-2369. Strategies for applying retrofit radiation shielding to the ISS. Ne al Zapp, Lockheed-Martin Space Opera- tions; Francis A. Cucinotta, NASA Johnson Space Center; and Bill Atwell, Boeing Co. Currently, the exposure limits outlined for crews of the ISS (International Space Station) are based on two principles. The first is that the excess risk to that crewmember be maintained at a level below 3%. The second is that radiation protection personnel must adhere to the ALARA (As Low As Reasonable Achievable) princi- ple. This principle would mandate that for any exposure, the risk incurred as a result be weighed against the social and economic ben- efits of the activity. An ancillary conclusion of this principle is that if it is possible to lower an exposure through relatively low cost, while not hindering the benefits, then that type of precaution should be pursued. With this in mind, the Space and Life Science Director- ate at NASA's center for manned spaceflight, Johnson Space Center in Houston, has undertaken a project to retrofit radiation shielding into those portions of the ISS where crews are expected to spend larger amounts of time. We present here an overview of the strate- gies, constraints, and preliminary results of this analysis. In addition, we present an overview of the suite of calculational tools used, their status, and work in progress to update the design environment in which analyses of this type are performed in support of manned spaceflight. 2001-01-2370. International Space Station radiation shield- ing model development. G. D. Quails, J. W. Wilson, and C. San- dridge, NASA Langley Research Center ; F. A. Cucinotta, NASA Johnson Space Center; J. E. Nealy and J. H. Heinbockel, Old Dominion Univ.; C. P. Hugger, J. Verhage, and B. M. Anderson, George Washington Univ.; W. Atwell, Boeing Co.; and N. Zapp, and R. Barber, Wyle Laboratories. The projected radiation levels within the International Space Sta- tion (ISS) have been criticized by the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel in their report to the NASA Administrator. Methods for opti- mal reconfiguration and augmentation of the ISS shielding are now being developed. The initial steps are to develop reconfigurable and realistic radiation shield models of the ISS modules, develop com- putational procedures for the highly anisotropic radiation environ- ment, and implement parametric and organizational optimization procedures. The targets of the redesign process are the crew quarters where the astronauts sleep and determining the effects of ISS shadow shielding of an astronaut in a spacesuit. The ISS model as developed will be reconfigurable to follow the ISS. Swapping inter- nal equipment rack assemblies via location mapping tables will be one option for shield optimization. Lightweight shield augmentation materials will be optimally fit to crew quarter areas using parametric optimization procedures to minimize the augmentation shield mass. The optimization process is being integrated into the Intelligence Synthesis Environment's (ISE's) immersive simulation facility at the Langley Research Center and will rely on High Performance Computing and Communication (HPCC) for rapid evaluation of shield parameter gradients. 2001-01-2371. Modeling of the Shuttle tissue-equivalent pro- portional counters using computer-automated design tech- niques and radial frequency distributions. R. E. Barber, Wyle Laboratories; and F. A. Cucinotta, H. Nikjoo, G. D. Quails, and J. W. Wilson, NASA Johnson Space Center. A higher fidelity shield model and response model have been developed for the Shuttle TEPC. The shield model was built using a CAD package in conjunction with a ray tracer. The response model considers the spatial restriction on the mean-energy imparted and the variance for direct particle effects and combines the radial distribution of the electron energy and flux about incoming ions with the distribution of electron frequencies from Monte Carlo sim- ulations. The latter model accounts for secondary electrons entering the sensitive area of the TEPC. The new models are compared against measurements of a variety of shielding depths of aluminum and polyethylene that were acquired on the Shuttle during STS-81 and STS-89. Good agreement is obtained between the models and the measurements for trapped proton effects. 2001-01-2372. Shuttle spacesuit: Fabric/LCVG model valida- tion. J. W.

Ander- son, George Washington Univ.; F. A. Cucinotta, NASA Johnson Space Center; and J. Ware and A. E. Persans, ILC Dover. A detailed spacesuit computational model is being developed at the Langley Research Center for radiation exposure evaluation studies. The details of the construction of the spacesuit are critical to estimation of exposures and assessing the risk to the astronaut on 306</page><page sequence="306">2001-01-2372-2001-01-2380 EVA. Past evaluations of spacesuit shielding properties assumed the basic fabric lay-up (Thermal Micrometeroid Garment, fabric restraints, and pressure envelope) and Liquid Cooling and Ventila- tion Garment (LCVG) could be homogenized as a single layer over- estimating the protective properties over 60 percent of the fabric area. The present spacesuit model represents the inhomogeneous distributions of LCVG materials (mainly the water filled cooling tubes). An experimental test is performed using a 34-MeV proton beam and high-resolution detectors to compare with model- predicted transmission factors. Some suggestions are made on possi- ble improved construction methods to improve the spacesuit' s pro- tection properties. 2001-01-2373. Assessment of the ISS US laboratory internal thermal control system design methodology and heuristics. Ahmad Y. Sleiman , Boeing Co. This report will discuss the design methodologies used to date in the development of the US Laboratory Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS) and describe the role heuristics played during the design process over the past six years. From designing the baseline system to conducting Hardware/Software Integration (HSI), and Acceptance testing with flight software, this report will provide the reader with an understanding of how we achieved the system topol- ogy and command/control of ITCS. 2001-01-2374. The thermal environmental control (TEC) of the Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL): A combined (water/air) thermal design solution for a Columbus active rack. P. Vaccaneo and M. Goiter o , Alenia Spazio. The Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL) is an advanced multi-user facility for conducting fluid physics research in microgravity condi- tions. It will be installed in the Columbus module of the Interna- tional Space Station (ISS) scheduled for launch in 2004. FSL is being developed by a European industrial team, led by ALENIA SPAZIO of Italy, and managed by the European Space Agency (ESA). The FSL Thermal Environment Control (TEC) establishes a defined thermal environment during the complete experiment dura- tion to keep the experiment and the supporting subsystems within their thermal requirements. The TEC is further subdivided into three sections. The Air Cooling Section is based on the Avionics Air Assembly (AAA) which generates air streams inside the Facility to collect, by forced convection, the waste heat from the electronics belonging to the various Subsystems. The Secondary Water Loop (SWL) cooling Section provides the cooled water to the Experiment Container. It is a complete thermal control loop hosted in its dedicated drawer. The Primary Water Loop (PWL) Section routes the cooling fluid of the Columbus Laboratory Active Thermal Control Subsystem (ATCS) to the Heat Exchangers of the Secondary water and the air loops. In this work, the Thermal Control of the Facility will be pres- ented and analyzed. The FSL Integrated Thermal Mathematical Model, enabling the investigation of the thermal behavior of the three TEC Sections in the frame of the whole Facility, will be explained. 2001-01-2375. Gas volume evacuation characteristics for closed volumes and the thermal/fluid effect of discharge process on attached hardware for International Space Station environ- mental conditions. Charles E. Martin, ERC, Incorporated; and Bob Colbert and Stuart Nelson, Sverdrup Technology, Incorpo- rated. The Vacuum Access System (VAS) is used for ISS experiment chamber evacuations and to remove air from furnace experiment sleeves. The evacuation process thermodynamically reduces the temperature of the gas being evacuated which then cools the temper- ature of attached hardware. This cooling effect can present problems to the environment if it reaches the local ambient dewpoint tempera- ture. This paper presents real and ideal gas thermodynamic relation- ships as an application to determine the discharge characteristics of the VAS evacuation process and determine the heat transfer rate to the surrounding and attached hardware. 2001-01-2377. An electrical power planning simulation and graphical user interface for an advanced space habitat life sup- port system. Gary Huband and Michael Dowell, Georgia Southern Univ. BIO-Sim is a software package developed at Georgia Southern University that simulates the electrical power consumption of devices in a planetary habitat life support system. BIO-Sim consists of four parts: a graphical user interface (GUI), a power usage simu- lation, a data model, and a server/database. The GUI allows planners to easily enter/adjust device schedules; view the resulting power consumption on a bar chart, as well as the average power and total energy requirements. The simulation uses device schedules as input and creates the power consumption data. The database stores device properties and schedules. This paper concentrates on a detailed description of the software package. 2001-01-2378. Advanced components and techniques for cryogenic integration. D. Bugby, B. Marland, and C. Stouffer, Swales Aerospace; and B. Tomlinson, and T. Davis, Air E orce Research Laboratory. This paper describes the development and testing status of sev- eral novel components and integration tools for space-based cryo- genic applications.

Investigation of integral emissivity of semi- transparent fabrics and films. L. Ya. Paderin, Central Aero- Hydrodynamic Institute. The method and the facility for investigations of radiant charac- teristics (total emissivity, transparence and reflectance) of semi- transparent fabrics and films are presented. The method is based on a measurements and comparison of effective emissivity of a test sample with two different opaque sub- layers, whose radiant characteristics are known. These emissivity measurements are performed at the same temperatures. The determi- nation of effective total emissivity of is carried out by means of the measurement of total radiant flux of a test sample with sublayer when ones are rotated in a heating isothermal zone with a controlla- ble temperature. Facility permits to determine both the normal and hemispherical above radiant characteristics of semi-transparent fab- rics and films in the temperature range from 300 to 900 K. The investigation results obtained for three glass fabrics are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2380. The flight model Stirling cryocooler system for the INTEGRAL spectrometer. Andrew S. Gibson, Colin Ashman, and Saleem Akhtar, ASTRIUM UK Limited. The Astrium Stirling cycle cryocooler system is to provide cool- ing for the spectrometer on the International Gamma Ray Astro- physics Laboratory (INTEGRAL), an ESA space science satellite. 307</page><page sequence="307">2001-01-2380-2001-01-2388 This system has been designed, manufactured, assembled and tested by ASTRIUM Ltd. under direct ESA contract. It is comprised of four standard 50-80 K Stirling cryocoolers, arranged in redundant pairs and configured for vibration minimization. Two spare cryo- coolers have also been fully validated. Heritage has been maximized by using mechanisms with existing flight heritage and previously qualified flexible thermal link assemblies. Performance character- ization of the flight cryocoolers has been completed, including veri- fication of cooling capability, passive vibration control, synchroni- zation of the two pairs and the effectiveness of the active launch- lock control of compressor and displacer pistons. 2001-01-2381. A new approach of absorption-based cryo- coolers for space application. K. Nasri and D. Nikanpour, Cana- dian Space Agency. Cryogenic cooling of infrared detectors is a well know require- ment and need for many instruments in space application. The need for higher-performance and long-life cryogenic cooling system, along with already stringent requirements for vibration, compact- ness, and mass, is self-evident in spacecraft instruments especially for long space missions. It is therefore an object of this study to pro- vide a system that has the potential to meet these challenges. A new absorption-based cryocooler is presented and studied. Different absorption working fluids are selected and studied. Thermodynamic state performance and major items of the design specifications are described and presented. The main characteristics of the absorption system in this study are the lowest temperature that could be reached in the evaporator side and the nature of the work- ing fluid mixture. A maximum of 100 W cooling capacity in the evaporator side is considered. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2382.

International Space Station environmental control and life support system status: 2000-2001. James L. Reu- ter, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center ; and Richard Reysa, Boe- ing Co. The International Space Station (ISS) Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) system includes regenerative and non- regenerative technologies that provide the basic life support func- tions to support the crew, while maintaining a safe and habitable shirtsleeve environment. This paper provides a summary of the U.S. ECLS system activities over the past year, covering the period of time between May 2000 and April 2001. Significant progress was made on assembly of the ISS, with permanent crew occupation established in November 2000. The Phase 2 portion of the assembly has just one additional flight scheduled prior to completion, with Flight 7 A scheduled to bring the Airlock in June 2001. ISS budget limitations, which are still not completely resolved, have led to a reassessment of the late Phase 3 elements schedule and eventual growth to a seven person crew. The Node 3 regenerative ECLS design activities have continued with flight component manufactur- ing initiated. However, the delivery schedule to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for element integration has been delayed by 12 months. The Propulsion Module has been removed from assembly planning, while negotiations have begun to consider increased inter- national participation in the Habitation Module and Crew Rescue Vehicle development. 2001-01-2387. International Space Station Node 3 environ- mental control and life support system status. Robert M. Bagdi- gian and Kathryn Y. Ogle, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The International Space Station (ISS) Node 3 includes a substan- tial amount of equipment to support a variety of Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) functions. This includes a combination of equipment items that are common with ECLSS equipment distributed throughout other ISS pressurized elements and other equipment that is unique to Node 3. Common equipment provides non-regenerative ECLS functions of atmosphere control and supply (ACS), temperature and humidity control (THC), fire detection and suppression (FDS), and waste management (WM) for Node 3 and/or attached elements. Additional equipment provides air revitalization (AR) and water recovery and management (WRM) functions that are necessary for station-level redundancy, but in a manner that allows for the minimization of life support logistics bur- dens. This paper provides an overview of the Node 3 ECLSS as a whole, with particular emphasis on the unique aspects of the Node 3 ECLSS, including the regenerative Water Recovery System (WRS) and Oxygen Generation System (OGS) which support ISS AR and WRM functions, respectively. The development status, key issues and test findings, integration plans, and verification method- ologies are also presented. 2001-01-2388. International Space Station (ISS) United States (US) laboratory module environmental control and life support (ECLS) system close-out process for launch. Gregory J. Gentry and Richard P. Reysa, Boeing Defense and Space Group ; and Gary L. Wentz, Jr., National Aeronautics and Space Adminis- tration - Kennedy Space Center. The International Space Station (ISS) United States Laboratory module has been under test for approximately two years in the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) preparing for launch. Preparation activities for closing out the Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) system have included Closed Hatch testing to verify the capability of the life sup- port equipment to support the crew, final manufacturing steps, and the close-out process itself. These activities were accomplished by an integrated Boeing and NASA team, located at the Johnson Space Center (Houston, Texas), Marshall Space Right Center (Huntsville, Alabama) and Kennedy Space Center, Rorida.

Development of automated transfer vehicle cargo carrier (ATYCC) ECLS air distribution system based on the MPLM and COLUMBUS experience. Klaus Bockstahler and Helmut Westermann, Astrium GmbH. In 1995 the European Space Agency did award a C/D Contract for the design &amp; development of an ECLS Subsystem for the Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) to Astrium' s ECLS 'Center of Competence' that built the ECLSS for Spacelab already. Actually first MPLM modules were successfully flown to the ISS with the Astrium-built ECLSS qualified as 'excellent' by the crew having asked permission to sleep in there. In parallel the design and devel- opment of an ECLS for Europe's Columbus module did commence and is actually close to completion. In view of the above, a broad set of qualified and even space- proven ECLS equipment is now 'on-hands' to thoroughly compose respectively derive the ECLS subsystems of future applications, e.g., HabModule, CRV and Space Hotel at a limited delta design and validation effort thus fitting into the tighter financial budgets of the manned space programs to come. First proof on subject is given by the approach that was realized on the development of an ECLS Air Distribution System for the ATV's Cargo Carrier as laid down in the main section of this paper. 2001-01-2393. Royal Navy submarine air purification - Current and future. David Diamond, Mark Lunn, and Hilary Bol- lan, UK Ministry of Defence. The patrol duration of a nuclear submarine dictates a continuous supply of breathable air to support life. Not only does the air purifi- cation equipment need to be capable of supplying the required amount of breathable air but volatile materials harmful to the crew must also be removed from the atmosphere. Therefore, within the nuclear submarine, air is continuously passed through air purifica- tion machinery where all major contaminants are reduced and the oxygen replenished. It is essential that the air be monitored regu- larly, that air purification equipment be run continuously and effi- ciently, and the escape of harmful volatile materials into the subma- rine atmosphere be prevented. The equipment must be capable of providing a suitable atmo- sphere for the duration of a patrol. The reality of the situation has demonstrated that maintaining the balance of a suitable atmosphere is an ongoing problem. This paper outlines the techniques currently used to control the atmosphere in Royal Navy (RN) submarines and highlights some of the more problematic areas. It also discusses the ongoing medium and long-term programs of development work. 2001-01-2394. Supported liquid membranes for carbon diox- ide removal from submarine atmospheres: Experiences with a technology demonstrator. Gareth Toft, Defence Evaluation and Research Agency; Steve Cassidy, Wellman Defence; and Mark Lunn, UK Ministry of Defence. The removal of carbon dioxide from a submarine's atmosphere is vital if it is to remain submerged for any length of time. In a joint collaboration between the UK's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and Wellman Defence, a novel carbon dioxide removal unit that uses supported liquid membranes, has been con- structed and tested. 2001-01-2396. Toxicological assessment of the International Space Station atmosphere. John T. James, NASA Johnson Space Center; and Thomas Limero, Steve Beck, Lilly Yang, Millie Martin, Phillip Covington, John Boyd, and Deborah Lind, Wyle Life Sci- ences. Space-faring crews must have safe breathing air throughout their missions to ensure adequate performance and good health. Toxico- logical assessment of air quality depends on the standards that define acceptable air quality, measurements of pollutant levels dur- ing the flight, and reports from the crew on their in-flight percep- tions of air quality. Air samples from ISS flights 2A.2a, 2A.2b, 3 A, and 4 A were analyzed for trace pollutants. On average the air during each flight was safe for human respiration. However, there were reports from the crew that they experienced a headache when in cer- tain areas, and strong odors were reported from specific locations of the ISS complex. Inspection of air samples in these locations sug- gested that several of the solvent-type pollutants (e.g. ethyl acetate, xylenes, and n-butanol) were present in concentrations that would cause a strong odor to be perceived by some individuals. There were large variations in pollutants from selected modules upon first entry; however, the egress samples from each module showed nearly uni- form mixing of the atmospheres by the time the ISS was resealed. The Service Module was added during this period and samples of its unscrubbed atmosphere and scrubbed atmosphere show that scrubbing was effective, especially against pollutants that were pres- ent in relatively high concentrations. 2001-01-2398. Predictive techniques for spacecraft cabin air quality control. J. L. Perry, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. As assembly of the International Space Station (ISS) proceeds, predictive techniques are used to determine the best approach for handling a variety of cabin air quality challenges. These techniques use equipment offgassing data collected from each ISS module before flight to characterize the trace chemical contaminant load. Combined with crew metabolic loads, these data serve as input to a predictive model for assessing the capability of the onboard atmo- sphere revitalization systems to handle the overall trace contaminant load as station assembly progresses. The techniques for predicting in-flight air quality are summarized along with results from early ISS mission analyses. Results from ground-based analyses of in- flight air quality samples are compared to the predictions to demon- strate the technique's relative conservatism. 2001-01-2399. A process to evaluate advanced technologies for future NASA needs. Thomas Limero, Wyle Laboratories Inc.; and John T. James, NASA Johnson Space Center. The development of innovative technologies leading to flight hardware requires substantially more funding than typical commer- cial development efforts. Therefore, given the current resource con- straints at NASA, funding must be invested wisely in new technolo- gies having a high probability of meeting requirements established by NASA. The Toxicology Laboratory at Johnson Space Center (JSC) was faced with such a choice in selecting technology for a sec- ond-generation volatile organic analyzer to be used for monitoring spacecraft air quality in the later phases of the International Space Station (ISS). A method was needed that could fairly and accurately evaluate technologies and ultimately lead to the selection of the best technology. A systematic approach to identifying, reviewing, and rating advanced technologies was developed. Results from the sec- ond-generation VOA activities will be used to illustrate this unique technology selection process. 2001-01-2400. Recovery from one failure during early assem- bly stages of the International Space Station. Gyan Hajela, Boe- ing Co. Primary source of electric power for the International Space Sta- tion (ISS) is the photovoltaic module (PVM). At assembly complete stage, the ISS is served by four PVMs. Each PVM contains two independent power channels such that one failure will result in loss of one power channel. During early stages of assembly, the ISS is served by only one PVM and one power channel failure has a more significant impact on the ISS electric power capability. In the lim- 309</page><page sequence="309">2001-01-2400-2001-01-2407 ited context of this study, the early stages are limited to stages 4A and 5A. Power channel components are arranged in orbital replaceable units (ORU) and repairs are accomplished by replacing these ORUs. While a power channel is operating, all of its ORUs are maintained within their allowable temperature ranges by a balance between the heat generated and heat removed. Heat removal is accomplished either passively or by an active thermal control system, called pho- tovoltaic thermal control system (PV TCS). An ORU failure may result in dormancy of one or more ORUs, and in the worst case, dormancy of all ORUs within one power channel and shutdown of PV TCS. Dormant ORUs may exceed their allowable temperature ranges and may result in failure of additional ORUs. It is very important to ensure that all dormant, but otherwise operational ORUs, remain within their allowable temperature ranges. A set of operational procedures exists that uses backfeed of elec- tric power to monitor and control temperature of dormant ORUs in one power channel. These procedures cannot be used during the early stages without performing an extravehicular activity (EVA) to install electric jumpers. During the early stages, it may take 1 week to plan and complete an EVA. This time period is long enough that all dormant ORUs will reach their steady-state temperatures and potentially suffer damage because of thermal exceedances. This paper describes a new set of procedures that can thermally protect dormant ORUs. These procedures use the following: Supply of DC control power from the operating channel to the dormant channel via remote bus isolators (RBI). Control of the ISS orientation with respect to Sun and space within allowable ranges. Supply of secondary power via remote power controller (RPC). The paper also describes electric power capability of the PVM and how it can satisfy power demands with only one operating power channel. 2001-01-2404. International Space Station (ISS) integrated motor controller assembly (IMCA). Fred Fagan and Walter Sainio, Honeywell Engines &amp; Systems. The Integrated Motor Controller Assembly (IMCA) is a self- contained 'universal' package with interface and control electronics, motor, and gearing. It is used in multiple applications on the Interna- tional Space Station (ISS) as the actuator/prime mover. Digital com- mands received from the ISS Multiplexer/DeMultiplexer (MDM) computer via a MIL-STD-1553 digital data bus are converted to drive signals to operate and control motor output. The control loop includes a compensation algorithm providing low cogging torque - a critical requirement in preventing excitation of the ISS structure. The users of higher-level mechanisms can tailor control algorithm operational parameters by downloading from the MDM. 2001-01-2405. Trace gas analyzer for extra-vehicular activ- ity. T. Abbasi, M. Christensen, and M. Villemarette, Oceaneering Space Systems; and M. Darach, and A. Chutjian, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Trace Gas Analyzer (TGA) is a self-contained, battery- powered mass spectrometer that is designed for use by astronauts during extravehicular activities (EVA) on the International Space Station (ISS). The TGA contains a miniature quadrupole mass spec- trometer array (QMSA) that determines the partial pressures of ammonia, hydrazines, nitrogen, and oxygen. The QMSA ionizes the ambient gas mixture and analyzes the component species according to their charge-to-mass ratio. The QMSA and its electronics were designed, developed, and tested by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Oceaneering Space Systems supported JPL in QMSA detector development by performing 3D computer for optimal volumetric integration, and by performing stress and thermal analyses to para- meterize environmental performance. Oceaneering led in the pack- aging and integration of the QMSA detector to meet the electro- magnetic interference, thermal, vibration, and volumetric con- straints that are imposed by the extra- vehicular environment and by the TGA' s use as an astronaut tool. Oceaneering developed and fur- nished the battery power conditioning and distribution module, interlock telemetry module, sunlight-legible display with associated interface, miniaturized ion pumps with integrated power supply, interconnect cabling, and casings. Oceaneering also carried out the performance, flight-qualification and certification testing. An EVA- qualified battery pack was used in order to maintain commonality with existing EVA tools. The TGA program was placed on a fast-insertion track in order to meet a critical need for ammonia (NH3) detection in the cooling lines exterior to the ISS. Such leaks were expected to occur in cases where the quick-disconnect (QD) fittings in these lines did not seal properly. Oceaneering and JPL led the transformation of a 19-inch rack-mounted laboratory instrument into an EVA tool that can be operated while hand-held, mounted to the astronaut's mini worksta- tion, or mounted to the body restraint tether (BRT). The TGA sys- tem was launched on schedule aboard STS-98 in January, 2001. It is presently aboard the ISS awaiting use in the event of a QD failure. The TGA can detect trace concentrations of all hydrazine species in the EVA environment, and with modifications it could be used for measuring hydrazine concentrations in the airlock of the ISS or the Shuttle Orbiter. When outfitted with a gas Chromatograph front- end, it could also be used to monitor the quality of cabin air during long-duration human missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. 2001-01-2406. Finite difference (FD) to finite element (FEA) temperature translation using 'Sinda temperature translator (STT)' Robert A. Wise and Paul M. McElroy, Technical Alliance Group. The deployment and curing of multi-layer film structures for inflatable and large Gossamer-type space structures requires accu- rate modeling of the temperature distributions within and among the different layers of the structure. The Sinda Temperature Translator (STT) was developed to specifically provide the application of accu- rate thermal load profiles on each component of thin-film multi- layer space inflatable structures during the performance of multidis- cipline analyses. STT provides a methodology to accurately map the temperatures obtained during transient thermal orbital analyses (finite difference methods) to structural finite element analyses (FEA) models. The derivation of the equations are for the translation of tempera- tures from the thermal models such as SINDA/G, which places the temperatures at the centroid of the elements, to traditional structural models, such as Cosmos/M and NASTRAN that places the tempera- tures at the corners of the element. The derivations in this paper cov- ers only translations to Cosmos/M but is applicable to NASTRAN. STT is a computer program which translates the temperatures from the SINDA/G coordinate system to the structures coordinate system using linear averaging. The four closest points from the SINDA/G coordinate system are used to obtain the temperatures for the structures model. The temperatures must be translated component by component in order to assure accuracy, since the SINDA/G model uses the coor- dinates of the centroid of the element and the structures model uses the corner points of the element. The SINDA model and the struc- tures model do not have to have the same element size or pattern, although the global coordinate systems must be the same for both the thermal and structures models. Examples of accurate translation of temperatures using this method have been obtained for interdisci- pline models for aeroshell and space inflatable structures. These results are presented as validation of the methodology. 2001-01-2407. Looking for the design limits: First steps to establish a new methodology. Alejandro Torres and Félix Lamela, EADS CASA Espacio. 310</page><page sequence="310">2001-01-2407-2001-01-2415 This paper presents a modest approach of a new type of method- ology to design thermal subsystems based on the knowledge of the limits of the proposed designs and its capabilities to adopt changes since the early phases of the projects. The methodology is based on establishing two major contents. Firstly, a thermal performance database using Monte Carlo and statistical results exploitation simi- lar to the stochastic analysis discipline and, secondly, a thermal uncertainties database using pure stochastic analysis. As conse- quence, an attempt to redefine and compare the objectives of each of the present phase's definition is provided. 2001-01-2408. Thermal analysis tools for design and test cor- relation imposing objectives. Félix Lamela and Alejandro Torres , EADS CASA Espacio. This paper presents a possible methodology and software devel- opments to run thermal models that automatically look for solutions that fulfil imposed objectives. The software must create cloned models, with varying characteristics, compare the results with the objectives and take decisions about how to modify the input data in order to fulfil the objectives. This type of analysis improves the knowledge of the thermal performances of any space segment, and will help in complex problems in which the design and the perfor- mances cannot be easily anticipated and justified. A particular case in which this methodology can be implemented corresponds to the correlation phase of thermal tests. This methodology has been applied to the satellite design, the coatings selection in active antennas and test correlation. 2001-01-2409. Using EcosimPro for thermal and thermo- hydraulic analysis in ESA. Olivier Pin , ESA ESTEC. EcosimPro is a multi-disciplinary simulation tool with a power- ful object-oriented simulation language, state-of-the-art solvers and a user-friendly environment with the look and feel of Microsoft® Visual Studio. It is the recommended ESA simulation tool for ECLS and has been used successfully for the European activities of the International Space Station program. Given its potential to address any kind of simulation, EcosimPro is increasingly being used at ESA and in Industry to carry out thermal and thermo-hydraulic sim- ulations. This paper describes how EcosimPro can be used in this context and provides recent application examples. 2001-01-2410.

Development of vapor-phase hydrogen perox- ide sterilization process for spacecraft applications. Naresh Rohatgi , Wayne Schubert, Jennifer Knight, Megan Quigley, Gustaf Forsberg, Gani Ganapathi, Charles Yarbrough, and Robert Koukol, Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In order to meet microbial reduction requirements for all Mars in-situ life detection and sample return missions, entire planetary spacecraft (including planetary entry probes and planetary landing capsules) may have to be exposed to a qualified sterilization process. At JPL, we are developing a low-temperature (-45 °C) vapor-phase hydrogen peroxide sterilization process. This process is currently being used by the medical industry and its effectiveness is well established. In order to effectively and safely apply this technology to steril- ize a spacecraft, which is made out of various man-made materials and electronic circuit boards, the following technical issues need to be resolved: 1. Efficacy of sterilization process. 2. Diffusion of H2O2 under sterilization process conditions into hard to reach places. 3. Materials and components compatibility with the sterilization pro- cess. 4. Development of methodology to protect (isolate) sensitive components (i.e., electronic) from H2O2 vapor. This paper will present test data and discussion on the work we are conducting at JPL to address these issues. 2001-01-2412. A testbed for the Mars returned sample han- dling facility. Rocco L. Mancinelli and Ragnhild Landheim, SETI Institute; and Geoffrey A. Briggs and Stanley R. Farkas, NASA Ames Research Center. Samples of Mars surface material will return to Earth in 2014. Prior to curation and distribution to the scientific community the returned samples will be isolated in a special facility until their bio- logical safety has been assessed following protocols established by NASA's Planetary Protection Office. The primary requirements for the pre-release handling of the Martian samples include protecting the samples from the Earth and protecting the Earth from the sam- ple. A testbed will be established to support the design of such a facility and to test the planetary protection protocols. One design option that is being compared to the conventional Biological Safety Level 4 facility is a double-walled differential pressure chamber with airlocks and automated equipment for analyzing samples and transferring them from one instrument to another. 2001-01-2413. Fundamental study of water generation sys- tem on Mars. Atsuko Nakata, Hiroaki Matsumoto, Shigekazu Hatano, and Yoshihiro Kita, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. ; and Takanobu Shimoda, National Space Development Agency of Japan. A manned Mars mission will be undertaken in the near future. Then the need for 'water' will become critical. One of the solutions to the problem is making use of the resources on Mars. We take notice of CO2 reduction. The method is to generate H2O from CO2, which is major composition of Martian atmosphere. Nominally, the reaction of CO2 reduction is performed at atmo- spheric pressure on Earth. However, the nominal pressure of the Martian atmosphere is below 10 torr. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm whether the reaction of CO2 reduction can be performed with same efficiency as on Earth. This paper summarizes the results of a fundamental study of CO2 reduction system for a Mars mission. 2001-01-2414. Solar energy fluidized bed reduction of ilmen- ite with hydrogen and methane at high temperature. G. De Maria, B. Brunetti, and G. Trionfetti, Universita di Roma "La Sapienza "; and D. Ferro, CNR. Ilmenite is one of the main components in lunar soil reaching about 14% at the Apollo 1 1 landing site. A 1.5 kW solar furnace has been employed to reduce ilmenite at high temperature with hydro- gen and methane. The coupling of the solar furnace with the sound- assisted fluidized bed apparatus is described together with the results obtained. The results have been compared with the ones reported previously in a sound-assisted fluidized bed study. Ther- mogravimetry, X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDS techniques were utilized to investigate the reaction mechanisms involved in the vari- ous steps of the process. 2001-01-2415. Closed-loop carbon dioxide removal for the International Space Station (ISS). Dina El Sherif and Aunali Soni, Honeywell International, Inc. Carbon dioxide removal is an essential part of any environmental control and life support system of an enclosed atmosphere. The cur- rent state of key technology is the existing International Space Sta- tion (ISS) Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) used to selectively remove carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere. The CDRA is part of the ISS air revitalization system. This paper will present approaches to recover the carbon dioxide for downstream processing. A discussion of a closed-loop CDRA system that will selectively remove carbon dioxide from the cabin air supply and this product will be routed to a carbon dioxide reduc- 311</page><page sequence="311">2001-01-2415-2001-01-2424 tion system, where the oxygen will be recovered. Using a CDRA system modified for closed-loop operation, a case by case illustra- tion of the sequential operation will be presented. 2001-01-2416. International Space Station (ISS) United States carbon dioxide removal assembly blower anomaly resolu- tion. Richard Rey sa and Matt Russell , Boeing Co.; and Jim Knox , NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) is the primary carbon dioxide removal system located in the United States On- Orbit Segment (USOS) Laboratory module 'Destiny' and Node 3 on the International Space Station (ISS). CDRA is housed in a stan- dard ISS rack defined as the Atmosphere Revitalization (AR) rack consisting of the CDRA, Trace Contaminant Control Subassembly and Major Constituent Analyzer. The AR subsystem operation and failure detection are controlled automatically using software that has provisions for override control. This paper will present the blower failure that was experienced during AR rack level and Laboratory ECLS integrated testing. The failure description, failure investigation findings and steps taken to return CDRA to flight will be covered. 2001-01-2418. CO2 pump for the Space Station advanced atmosphere revitalization subsystem. S. T. Green and F. A. Tho- massy , Southwest Research Institute; and J. C. Graf and J. F. Lewis , Johnson Space Center/NASA. The current operation of the International Space Station (ISS) calls for the oxygen used by the occupants to be vented overboard in the form of CO2, after the CO2 is scrubbed from the cabin air. Likewise, H2 produced via electrolysis in the oxygen generator is also vented. NASA is investigating the use of the Sabatier process to combine these two product streams to form water and methane. The water is then used in the oxygen generator, thereby conserving this valuable resource. One of the technical challenges to developing the Sabatier reactor is transferring CO2 from the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) to the Sabatier reactor at the required rate, even though the CDRA and the Sabatier reactor operate on dif- ferent schedules. One possible way to transfer and store CO2 is to use a mechanical compressor and a storage tank. Most commercially available compressors, however, use lubricants that are incompati- ble with the other system components, motors that do not match the ISS power supply, and have acoustic signatures that often exceed the ISS limits. A new oil-free compressor design that overcomes these problems was demonstrated in an earlier study. The adaptation of that design to the ISS Sabatier-based system is described in this paper. 2001-01-2420. The design and testing of a fully redundant regenerative CO2 removal system (RCRS) for the Shuttle Orbiter. Tom Filburn and Tim Nalette , Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International; and John Graf NASA Johnson Space Center. Research into increased capacity solid amine sorbents has found a candidate (SA9T) that will provide enough increase in cyclic car- bon dioxide removal capacity to produce a fully redundant Regener- ative Carbon Dioxide Removal System (RCRS). This system will eliminate the need for large quantities of backup LiOH, thus gaining critical storage space on board the shuttle orbiter. This new sorbent has shown an ability to package two fully redundant (four) sorbent beds together with their respective valves, fans and plumbing to create two operationally independent systems. The increase in CO2 removal capacity of the new sorbent will allow these two systems to fit within the envelope presently used by the RCRS. This paper reports on the sub-scale amine testing performed in support of the development effort. In addition, this paper will pro- vide a preliminary design schematic of a fully redundant RCRS. 2001-01-2422. Salad crop production under different wave- lengths of red light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Gregory D. Goins, Lisa M. Rujfe , Nathan A. Cranston, and Neil C. Yorio, Dynamac Corp.; and Raymond M. Wheeler, and John C. Sager, NASA Ken- nedy Space Center. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) represent an innovative artificial lighting source with several appealing features specific for support- ing plants, whether on space-based transit vehicles or planetary life support systems. Appropriate combinations of red and blue LEDs have great potential for use as a light source to drive photosynthesis due to the ability to tailor irradiance output near the peak absorption regions of chlorophyll. This paper describes the importance of far- red radiation and blue light associated with narrow-spectrum LED light emission. In instances where plants were grown under lighting sources in which the ratio of blue light (400-500 nm) relative to far- red light (700-800 nm) was low, there was a distinct leaf stretching or broadening response. This photomorphogenic response sanc- tioned those canopies as a whole to reach earlier critical leaf area indexes (LAI) as opposed to plants grown under lighting regimes with higher blue:far-red ratios. In many instances, the salad crops grown under LEDs were just as productive as crops grown under broad-spectrum light, largely as a consequence of more efficient light interception during early growth. 2001-01-2423. Plant hardware equipped with hybrid light- ing: Combining solar irradiance with xenon-metal halide lamps or light-emitting diodes for life support in space. Joel L. Cuello, Yu Yang, Sara Kuwahara, Eiichi Ono, and Kenneth Jordan, Univer- sity of Arizona; Takashi Nakamura, Physical Sciences Inc.; and Hiroyuki Watanabe, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. Hybrid solar and electric lighting (HYSEL) systems constitute the latest generation of lighting systems for advanced life support, exhibiting continued potential for reducing the significant electrical power demand of current bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS). Two experimental HYSEL systems were developed: one employing xenon-metal halide (XMH) lamps and the other adopting light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the electric-lighting components, and both using a mirror-based, fiberoptic-based solar collection sys- tem. The results showed that both the XMH and LED HYSEL sys- tems effected reduced effective plant growing volume, indicating potential for a compact plant hardware design. The apparent electri- cal conversion efficiency of the LED HYSEL system exceeded that of the XMH HYSEL system by five-fold. Both the XMH and LED HYSEL systems provided reasonably acceptable spectral quality and lighting uniformity. So far, LEDs appear to be the most compe- tent artificial light source for a HYSEL system. Also, preliminary studies suggested that HYSEL systems show promise of BLSS application both on the Martian surface and on a Sun synchronous orbit around Mars. 2001-01-2424. Estimation of efficiency of the vitamin convey- or-type plant growth facility 'phytocycle' from ground tests. Yu. A. Berkovich, S. O. Smolianina, and N. M. Krivobok, Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Plants of the celery cabbage (Brassica pekinensis (Lour) Rupr.) were grown in a Vitamin Conveyor-Type Plant Growth Facility (PGF) Thytocycle' with a cylindrical planting surface being the ground prototype of a vitamin greenhouse for the International Space Station. We offered a global criterion of an overall efficiency, Q, of space plant growing units as a maximum of the product Q = Mv*Me, where Mv and Me are specific productivity of the PGF per unit of volume and per unit of consumed energy. For each step of conveyor crop in Thytocycle' this criterion is proportional to value: Qx = Pí2*Sí/W¡; i = 4, 5, ... n, where Pi - a yield of the shoot dry mass at the i-th step of the conveyor, Si - the illuminated area on the i-th step of the conveyor, Wi - amount of energy of PAR fallen on the crop for conveyor step number i. Values of Qt were determined for each step at the steady regime of conveyor crop. The optimal num- ber io was chosen appropriate to the maximal meaning of the crite- rion. The age of plants at the end of the optimum conveyor step was assumed equal to the optimum length of plant growth cycle, To, for the first approach. The tests must be repeated for the conveyor crop 312</page><page sequence="312">2001-01-2424-2001-01-2433 with length of plant growth cycle equal ioT/n. The optimal number ioi at the second test iteration was determined as the optimum plant growth cycle. For the same plant illumination energy spent, crop on the convex cilindrical planting surface allows to receive more spe- cific productivity than crop on a flat one due to the plants auto- extending effect. The plants extending effect reduced a shading inside crop during the growth period. During the VCPGF 'Phytocy- cle' tests My was equal 0.8 kg/m3day, ME - 0.053 kg/kW*hr. Corre- spondingly, that are 30% more and almost twice more in compari- son with similar values for the most economical Russian conveyor- type PGF with a flat planting surface. 2001-01-2425. Factors controlling oxygen delivery in ALS hydroponie systems. O . Monje , J. Garland , and G. W. Stutte , Dynamac Corp. Future large-scale ALS systems may use hydroponie nutrient delivery systems (NDS) for growing staple and salad crops. Crop performance is strongly dependent on dissolved O2 concentration (DOC), pH, and nutrient content of the hydroponie solution. DOC is influenced by solution temperature and flow rate, growth rate of the crop, and the bacterial community present in the solution. Solu- tion temperature determines the solubility of O2 in water, and may increase as solution volume is reduced to minimize overall system mass. Flow may be altered when the height of the solution bathing the root zone is reduced because of dense root mats. These factors may produce anaerobic pockets where N2 losses by denitrification occur, but without yield losses, as long as sufficient O2 to meet root respiration is supplied. Bacterial communities may compete for DOC with the plants when the NDS is used for recycling gray water streams. Aeration experiments were conducted on a hydroponie sys- tem to calculate mass transfer coefficients for O2 as a function of flow rate. These coefficients decreased as flow rate increased, and flow rate was more important than solution temperature in control- ling DOC. This analysis was used to suggest minimum flow rates and maximum solution temperatures for meeting gray water recy- cling O2 demand for a crop growing hydroponically at low light.

Lertsiriyothin, B. K. Khoo, J. Lech, T. G. Hartman, J. A. Hogan, R. M. Cowan, and L. S. Logendra, Rutgers the State Univer- sity of New Jersey; and S. T. Kania, University of Arizona. An open system for collection of volatile organic compounds (VOC) was constructed to measure the emission rate of VOC from a whole plant of the small salad crops intended for use in NASA's Advanced Life Support Systems (ALSS). The design of the system provides a controlled plant growth environment in order to maintain normal plant physiology during VOC sampling. The system air is re-circulated through a heat exchanger to control the plant chamber temperature and humidity. An inlet air stream of 20 cc/min is purged through the system to prevent build-up of VOC to levels that may have adverse effects and to maintain system pressure at 1 atm. CO2 is added to maintain canopy concentration of 1000 pmole/mole and light is set at 250 pmol.m 2.sec-1 (photosynthetic photon flux, PPF). Overall, this system provides a nondestructive, steady-state rate measurement of emitted plant VOC even at very low levels, regard- less of plant age. Ethylene emission rates from USU- Apogee wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are presented here. 2001-01-2428. Design parameters for Mars déployable green- houses. Ray A. Bucklin, James D. Leary, Vadim Rygalov, and Yang Mu, University of Florida; and Phil A. Fowler, Dynamac Corp. Concepts for landing missions on Mars often include greenhouse structures for plant production. The types of structures proposed vary from small automatically deployed structures for research pur- poses to larger structures that would be used for food production. Present plans are that greenhouses on Mars will be operated at inter- nal pressures as low as 0.1 to 0.2 Earth atmospheres. Low internal pressures permit the use of structures with lower mass, but compli- cate the heat and mass transfer processes involved in maintaining a suitable environment for plant growth and raise questions about the requirements of plants for growth at low pressures. 2001-01-2430. Shadowing studies of external sites on The International Space Station. Igor Carron and Andrew Hensley, Commercial Space Center for Engineering. External sites on the International Space Station (ISS) will be used to test different technologies and to run scientific experiments. The design of some such experiments is highly dependent on envi- ronmental heat fluxes and direct sun exposure. The structure of the ISS is large enough and the orbit varied enough that all external locations are likely to be shadowed at one time or another by it. This shadowing study attempts to quantify this effect by determining the reduction in environmental heat flux as a consequence of said shad- owing. As an example, our study centered on the Express Pallets (ExPa) located on the S-3 truss. Comparisons with different bench- marks were made to verify the model. Results indicate a non-trivial shadowing effect of the structure on these external sites. 2001-01-2431. Thermal design solutions for space exposed P/L's and pointing systems on the ISS express pallet. D. Bat- taglia, F. D'Angelo, and L. Nava, Alenia Spazio. The use of the truss of the International Space Station (ISS) for the accommodation of several experiments, in the frame of the 'Early opportunity for ISS utilization,' will have a lot of advantages such as the possibility of human or robotics intervention, the recov- ery of the experiment at the end of its life, visual inspection of the items and cost reduction with respect to an installation on a dedi- cated satellite. However, from the user point of view, the ISS generates a great number of disturbances and severe environmental conditions for the experiments providing constraints and affecting the performances in different areas (thermal, mechanical, and avionics). The present paper will discuss the thermal aspects (disturbances, constraints and performances) concerning three different projects, developed by Alenia Spazio Turin plant, that will be mounted on the truss of the ISS: Hexapod, Coarse Pointing Device (CPD) and Sky Polarization Observatory (SPOrt). Hexapod and CPD are two pointing systems designed to give dif- ferent pointing capabilities to the payloads mounted on them. Their main requirements are thermal stability and reduction of local tem- perature gradients to ensure the Payloads required pointing accu- racy. SPOrt is a radiometer designed to observe the Cosmic Micro- wave Background (temperature near 0 K). Its main thermal require- ment is to maintain the four sensors (one for each antenna) at a cryo- genic temperature by means of pulse tube cryocoolers. A common problem for all ExPA payloads is the management of thermal interfaces with the Express Pallet Adapter (ExPA) Purpose of the paper is: Provide description of thermal design of the pointing systems and Experiments; Highlight the problems related to the thermal interface manage- ment with the ISS and the Payloads and provide approach to their solution; Provide description of the analytical tools/models used for the design; Illustrate the related verification philosophy. 2001-01-2433. Thermal analysis of compressible gaseous nitrogen flow of X-38 pressure control system for first mission phase. Y. M. Zhang, K. K. Andish, and J. F. Keener, Lockheed Mar- tin Space Operations; and C. W. Dingell, NASA Johnson Space Center. 313</page><page sequence="313">2001-01-2433-2001-01-2439 A SINDA/FLUINT model was developed for performing the thermal analysis of the compressible gaseous nitrogen (GN2) flow of X-38 pressure control system (PCS). The purpose of this analysis is to predict the thermal performance of X-38 PCS for the first mis- sion phase, and to ensure that the GN2 pressure in tank stays above 1000 psi and the GN2 temperature in tank stays above -65°F during a real mission phase. The model simulations of the X-38 PCS have been conducted with the flowrates of the first mission phase for dif- ferent ambient and GN2 temperatures with/without heating the GN2 tank wall. The predicted results show that the GN2 pressures and temperatures fulfill the requirements and limitations of the X-38 pressure control system without heating the GN2 tank wall. The electrical heaters on the GN2 tank exterior may be eliminated. 2001-01-2434. Proposal for increasing the capability for water transfer to the International Space Station via orbiter radiator flow control assembly logic redesign. Brian Dunaway, Boeing Co. Projected deficiencies of water required for the International Space Station (ISS) once it reaches the assembly complete (AC) phase necessitate alternative methods of generating, reclaiming, processing, or transporting water. The Space Shuttle Program (SSP) Orbiter is expected to provide a significant portion of required ISS water throughout the assembly and AC phases. Currently, the Shuttle Orbiter provides water as a byproduct of power generation by the Fuel Cells (FCs). The water not required by the Flash Evaporator System (FES) for cooling or by the crew for consumption is available for transfer to the ISS. The amount of water required for cooling by the Orbiter FES is dependent upon the Orbiter flight attitude and heat load; though, once the ISS has reached the AC configuration, the ISS (and thus the Orbiter docked to it) flight attitude will be restricted to a small envelope. Until now, there has been no significant motive to change Radia- tor Flow Control Assembly (RFCA) design, as there has been no significant water deficiency within the scope of the SSP. However, projections for water required by the ISS Program, especially for the ISS AC configuration, may provide the motivation for redesigning the RFCA logic in order to transfer more water to the ISS. Depending upon ISS flight attitudes, the projected increase of water available for transfer to the ISS could be as much as 500 lb. (227 kg.) per Orbiter mission. Although altering the RFCA control scheme would require investigation, it is believed that this could be accomplished without major impact to Orbiter design or safety considerations. 2001-01-2435. The common berthing mechanism (CBM) for International Space Station. Richard J. McLaughlin and William H. Warr, Honeywell Engines &amp; Systems. The International Space Station (ISS) Program utilizes the Com- mon Berthing Mechanism (CBM) hardware to mate/berth or demate/deberth two pressurized elements on-orbit. Berthing and deberthing of two elements together on-orbit occurs many times throughout the Space Station Assembly Sequence to provide pres- surized access between the module vestibules via hatches. The CBM system was developed by Boeing at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, under contract to NASA, and the CBM Control and Actuation Components were developed by Honeywell Engines &amp; Systems in Torrance, California, under con- tract to Boeing. 2001-01-2436. Spreadsheet analysis for early phase thermal design. Julian Thomas , ALSTOM Power Technology Centre; and Andrew Robson and Steve Price , Astrium Ltd. During the early phases of a design, where multiple scenarios and multiple configurations are considered, classic thermal analysis pro- cesses are far from ideal. It is desirable to be able to turnaround results in a couple of minutes rather than hours or days when evalu- ating ideas and available options. This paper presents the results of an initial study into developing such capability within a spreadsheet by building on the existing tool ThermXL 2001-01-2437. The analysis of space debris and micro- meteoroid impacts. Julian Thomas and Bruno Castelli , ALSTOM Power Technology Centre ; and John Sorensen , European Space Agency. The increasing concern in the space debris to spacecraft, above all long-term missions as the International Space Station, has increased the demand of reliable analysis tools, raised from industry and agencies. The improvement of environment models and hypervelocity impact predictions has increased the physical available knowledge to software designers. The DEBRIS application of ESABASE is a software simulation tool to assess the number of impacts and the resulting damage from meteoroids and space debris particles to spacecraft in low Earth orbit for user-specified mission parameters and shielding designs. The tool is based on existing environment flux and damage models. For space debris this includes the new NASA engineering model ORDEM 96. For meteoroids the models includes streams, direc- tional effects and velocity distributions. Secondary ejecta are also modeled and it is possible for the user to define his own damage equations for the analysis. The tool uses a statistical approach and allows a fully 3 -dimensional analysis. The main user-specified input parameters for an analysis are: the spacecraft geometry and attitude, the mission parameters, the flux models to be used for meteoroids and space debris, the particle size and velocity range to be analyzed, the shielding design and the damage class and equation. The main output parameters are: the number of impacts, the impact directions and velocities, the number of damage events (holes, craters, penetra- tions) and the probability of no damage. 2001-01-2438. Specular reflection allowing reduction and cal- culation of radiative heat transfer. Jochen D o ene eke, ASTRIUM. Configerations similar to 'V- Groo ve s,' as already applied for radiators, can also insulate complete spacecraft and telescopes from solar radiation or hot modules several orders of magnitude better than the usual MLI. The specularity of surfaces contributes to the reduction of the radiation between the shields and thus improves the insulation. In this paper absorption factors between specularly and diffusely reflecting conical and rectangular areas are presented ver- sus the 'V-angle' in order to design such insulating configurations. Monte Carlo methods cannot be applied for very complex con- figurations if the number of surfaces is too large. The introduction of auxiliary areas with 100% specular reflectivity helps to simplify these geometries. Herein, the principle of this technique is first explained and proven by two examples of V-grooves. Then this method is applied for a specific configuration: three parallel plates which each have more than 8000 holes. The results are compared with analytical equations which are valid for the special condition that the holes in each plate are distributed randomly. 2001-01-2439. Applications of thermal software Coratherm to provide spacecraft thermo-elastic inputs. Thierry Basset , Jean- Paul Dudon , and Christophe Vernay, Alcatel Space Industries Cannes. Availability of low-cost high-performance computing techniques leads to propose and assess a new and more accurate method dedi- cated to the thermo-elasticity studies, in order to refine pointing sys- tem simulation (star trackers for example) for the future scientific missions. Such a new tool should prevent over sizing and allow to relax other subsystem constraints. Moreover it should initiate a more clever and efficient collaboration between thermal and mechanical engineers. Coratherm capabilities have been used to build a Thermal/ Mechanical interface based on two complementary approaches and so to provide thermo-elastic inputs on panels with equipment. 314</page><page sequence="314">2001-01-2439-2001-01-2473 The first of both above solutions uses a MECHANICAL FE (Finite Element) NASTRAN model as input and calculates tempera- ture on each of its nodes. It is not a time-saving solution but it con- stitutes a direct NASTRAN-CORATHERM-NASTRAN interface. It should become a very convenient tool for mechanical engineers. The second solution simply uses the Coratherm conductive sub- model to provide a detailed cartography of temperature on the panel without overloading the thermal model. This solution is less adapted to a rigorous thermo-elasticity analysis and requires for that an addi- tional interface to interpolate temperatures on nodes of the NAS- TRAN FE model. However such a tool is very convenient and rapid for thermal engineers who want to check the consistency of their nodal model. In both cases, temperature distribution calculation for FE thermal loading does not come from a simple conductive interpolation but is the result of calculations based on a physically-consistent method so-called Equivale. These interfaces, which implement a new meth- odology for thermo-elastic studies, have been used in the frame of the JAC03 European project whose objective is to develop a high- performance distributed computing environment for coupling simu- lation codes (mechanics and thermies marketed and in-house codes). 2001-01-2441. Design and operation of a low pressure elec- trolyzer (LPE) for submarine applications. Benjamin E. Bishop, Jr. and Arthur K. Colling, Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International, Inc. A Low Pressure Electrolyzer (LPE) is being developed to pro- vide metabolic oxygen aboard US nuclear submarines. The system is derived from a more complex system already developed for the Virginia Class of attack submarines. The LPE generates up to 250 standard cubic feet per hour (SCFH) of oxygen at ambient pressure through electrolysis of water utilizing SPE® (Solid Polymer Electro- lyte) technology. The hydrogen is generated at pressures suitable for disposal overboard. The system operates unattended which mini- mizes crew workload, and can safely shut down without crew inter- vention. Generating oxygen at ambient pressure significantly reduces risk to personnel and greatly simplifies the system. Reliabil- ity, maintainability, safety, and ease of operation are major system design drivers. 2001-01-2465. (SP- 1636) 42V automotive power systems. Mehrdad Ehsani, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; Ali Emadi, Illinois Institute of Technology; and Hongwei Gao, Texas A&amp;M Univ. With the increase of hotel and ancillary loads and replacement of engine-driven mechanical and hydraulic loads with electrical loads, automotive systems are becoming more electric. This is the concept of More Electric Cars (MEC) that necessitates a higher sys- tem voltage, such as the proposed 42V, for conventional cars. In this paper, the development of the 42V electric power system for vehicle applications is reviewed. The system architecture and motor drive problems associated with the 42V electric power system are ana- lyzed. Solutions to these problems are also discussed. 2001-01-2467. Remote data acquisition using audio, video and data transmission. Badih Jawad and Kevin Nagy, Lawrence Technological Univ. The primary function of the electrical system for the Lawrence Tech Formula SAE 2001 vehicle was to supply essential engine and vehicle functions. Important secondary functions of the electrical system were real-time data acquisition, display of some of these data to the driver, and transmission of the data to race team members at a sideline location. In addition to data channels depicting vehicle function and health, the data-acquisition (DAC) system included video that duplicated the driver's view, and two-way audio. This paper describes the DAC system and its integration into the vehicle electrical system. 2001-01-2469. Best practices for an SAE SUPERMILEAGE® vehicle. B. Jawad, E. Marek, D. Tingley, Tony Salvati, J. McCoy, A. Ondes , E. Poota, and Vida Floma, Lawrence Technological Univ.

The Society of Automotive Engineers SUPERMILEAGE® Vehicle (SAE SMV) competition provides a challenging design problem for emerging professionals while increasing awareness of design and operation criteria necessary to minimize fuel consumption in a small displace- ment, single passenger vehicle platform. This report represents the benchmark and research results of the 2001 SAE SMV team from Lawrence Technological University (LTU). The report cites major sources of energy loss within the scope of the SMV project and, provides the team's analysis of best practices to minimize losses and optimize performance. 2001-01-2471. (SP-1635) CNG filter canister failure and sys- tem reliability analysis. Sudhir K. Agrawal, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; and Richard J. Martin, Exponent Failure Analysis Associates Inc. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) has a large fleet of CNG buses and several CNG refuel- ing sites. Filtration canisters are installed in the fueling systems to remove incidental particulate matter in the gas stream. On three occasions, refueling system filter canisters ruptured and caused damage to nearby buses. This paper describes the failure investigation that was performed after one of these incidents. The elements of the investigation included determination of the root cause of failure, metallurgical examination of both incident and exemplar canisters, and non-destructive testing of similar compo- nents still in service. It also describes a hazard analysis, which was performed to help identify and rank other process hazards associated with CNG refueling operations. Since the completion of this investi- gation, all similar filters in the MTA system were replaced with improved canisters, constructed from higher strength materials. The investigation concluded that the filter canister ruptured due to a fatigue crack, having been subjected to approximately 100,000 pressurization/depressurization cycles. Upon inspection, an exem- plar canister was found to exhibit a manufacturing defect that could reduce its fatigue life from 10,000,000 cycles (several hundred years) down to as little as three years. The hazard analysis uncov- ered no potential hazards that were ranked unacceptable or undesirable. 2001-01-2472. (SP-1635) Super-Gas™ fueling stations. Mauricio A. Sanchez , Carlos Borras, David Hergenrether, William H. Sutton, and Harris Chandra, University of Oklahoma. Two types of fueling stations have been designed to deliver a composite fuel called Super-Gas™. A 'slow fill' station, or called BOB (Bubbling on Board), is the first generation of fuel stations. This design is characterized by being a compact unit. Tests have shown that Super-Gas™ can be formulated at a fast rate (approx 8 minutes) with an acceptable percentage mixture of 54%, 46% liquid sample of CHU and C3H8, respectively, when the vehicle tank is nearly empty (pressure &lt;100 Psig). Super-Gas™ made by the 'fast fill' station (FFS) can be deliv- ered at approximate 5 to 8 minutes at any vehicle tank pressure. This operation requires the alternative fuel to be made in a separate tank and delivered to the vehicle. Results from the ongoing tests have also shown that by pre-filling the vehicle tank to a certain pressure before refueling, the amount of fuel lost by flashing is reduced. Also, fuel (gases) recovery from the vehicle tank is accomplished with this design. Finally, the attained fuel composition is approxi- mately the same as the BOB station. 2001-01-2473. (SP-1635) Super-Gas™ vehicle conversion. Mauricio A. Sanchez , Carlos Borras, David Hergenrether, and Wil- liam H. Sutton, University of Oklahoma. 315</page><page sequence="315">2001-01-2473-2001-01-2479 The composite fuel, trademarked as 'Super-Gas™,' a combina- tion of Propane (LPG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), is stored in liquid form at relatively low pressures (1460 psig) as com- pared to traditional CNG systems. Vehicle conversion systems for this fuel system utilize many of the same components (conversion kit) as commercially available CNG systems. Currently, three vehicles have been converted to operate in Super-Gas™ utilizing CNG conversion kits from three different aftermarket manufacturers. Driving testing has shown almost a two times increase in range compared to CNG for the same tank volume. Furthermore, RG-240 emission tests were successfully passed when the appropriate vehicle conversion is used. Finally, vehicle perfor- mance improves greatly even under heavy loads. Although the cost of the Super-Gas™ conversion kit is similar to the CNG's, the benefits of extended range and vehicle perfor- mance justify the investment. 2001-01-2474. (SP- 1635) Promise and cost of cellulosic etha- nol for the U.S. light-duty fleet. W. Michael Griffin and Lester B. Lave , Carnegie Mellon Univ.; and Heather L. MacLean, University of Toronto. Ethanol from biomass (trees and grasses) can provide a signifi- cant proportion of the fuel for the light-duty fleet, alleviating con- cerns about volatile prices, energy dependence, and global warming. We examine the costs and quantity of ethanol that can be produced from corn and biomass, as well as infrastructure issues associated with transporting and retailing ethanol for blending in gasoline. Large, but feasible, amounts of land and investment are required. Large-scale production is unlikely to occur until biomass ethanol becomes cheaper than gasoline or is mandated by regulation of gas- oline fuel economy or carbon dioxide emissions. 2001-01-2475. (SP- 1635) Oxygenated diesel: Emissions and performance characteristics of ethanol-diesel blends in CI engines. Irshad Ahmed , Pure Energy Corp. Diesel engines are major contributors of various types of air pol- luting exhaust gasses such as Particulate Matter (PM), Carbon mon- oxide (CO), Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Sulfur, and other harmful compounds. It has been shown that formation of these air pollutants can be significantly reduced by blending oxygenates into the base diesel. Ethanol-blended diesel (e-diesel) is a cleaner burning alterna- tive to regular diesel for both heavy-duty (HD) and light-duty (LD) compression ignition (CI) engines used in buses, trucks, off-road equipment, and passenger cars. Although ethanol has been used as a fuel oxygenate to reduce tail-pipe emissions in gasoline, its use in diesel has not been possible due to technical limitations (i.e., blend- ing). Commercially viable e-diesel is now possible due to the devel- opment of an additive system, Puranol, invented by Pure Energy Corporation (PEC). Puranol allows the splash blending of ethanol in diesel in a clear solution possible for the first time. Laboratory and field tests have demonstrated over 41% reduction in PM, 27% reduction in CO, and 5% reduction in NOx from a HD diesel engine. Significantly higher emissions reductions are observed from smaller 1.9-L VW TDI engines. 2001-01-2476. (SP- 1636) Advanced electronic solutions for highly dependable systems. Ross Bannatyne and Kevin Klein , Motorola Transportation Systems Group. This paper will discuss advances in electronic component tech- nology that has been developed specifically for failsafe and fault- tolerant automotive systems such as braking and chassis control sys- tems. These systems need to be highly dependable, and exhibit pre- dictable behavior in the event of a system fault. Such systems often perform many real-time self-checking opera- tions to detect the occurrence of a fault. Integrated on-chip hardware can be used in such systems to help ensure that the dependable sys- tem can provide a 'fail-safe' operating mode. There are many differ- ent configurations of hardware used in such embedded systems to realize the fail-safe methodology, each having its own unique char- acteristics in terms of fault coverage, costs, complexity and perfor- mance. Hardware implementations, as opposed to software plausi- bility checks by a watchdog, are often advantageous and require less systems development effort. This paper will discuss such on-chip systems that lead to optimized 'failsafe' microcontrollers. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2477. (SP- 1636) Electronically controlled interactive shift control system for motor vehicles. Bob DeJonge, GHSP. The system being presented here enables an automatic transmis- sion in a motor vehicle to react to the driving characteristics of a driver in the way and speed with which it shifts. It provides for fail- safe fully electronic control of the transmission including park lock FMVSS compliance, and allows all mechanical links between the shift control and the transmission to be eliminated. The 'tiptronic'-type shift systems known today provide some measure of manual control of an automatic transmission, as they allow sequential 'up &amp; down' selection of forward drive gears. Nev- ertheless, even as the forward gears are selected manually, the trans- mission is designed to shift between those gears in a predetermined manner, irrespective of the driver's intentions. These shift character- istics are necessarily a design compromise and not optimized to the situation the driver finds himself in at any particular moment, and usually detracts from the overall driving experience. The present system takes these commonly available sequential systems and adds the ability to modulate, or vary, the manner in which the transmission shifts from one gear to another, based entirely on real-time feedback pertinent to the situation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2478.

The desirable braking system of a land vehicle is that it can stop the vehicle or reduce the vehicle speed as quickly as possible, main- tain the vehicle direction stable and recover kinetic energy of the vehicle as much as possible. In this paper, an electronically con- trolled braking system for EV and HEV has been proposed, which integrates regenerative braking, automatic control of the braking forces of front and rear wheels and wheels antilock function together. When failure occurs in the electric system, the braking sys- tem can function as a conventional man-actuated braking system. Control strategies for controlling the braking forces on front and rear wheels, regenerative braking and mechanical braking forces have been developed. The braking energy that can be potentially recov- ered in typical driving cycle has been calculated. The antilock per- formance of the braking system has been simulated. The results show that significant amount of energy can be recovered and brak- ing performance of the vehicle is perfect. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2479.

Recent advances in dependable embedded system technology, as well as continuing demand for improved handling and passive and active safety improvements, have led vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to actively pursue development programs in computer- controlled, by-wire subsystems. These subsystems include steer-by- wire and brake-by-wire, and are composed of mechanically de- coupled sets of actuators and controllers connected through multi- plexed, in- vehicle computer networks; there is no mechanical link to the driver.

(SP- 1637) Could automotive HYAC become An EPA/DOE energy star? Kelvin Zhai, Freightliner LLC. EPA/DOE energy star program has effectively improved effi- ciency of home air conditioners by 25% with $25 billion annual sav- ing due to the requirement of minimum SEER 10. The population of AC-powered vehicles is estimated at around 180 million. The quantity may be even larger than that of home AC. Currently auto- motive AC seems to work less efficiently with estimation for EER of 5 typically. If the Energy Star program could extend into automo- tive AC to promote energy efficiency, the result would be a signifi- cant energy saving valued at 3.38 billion gallons of gas ($5.4 billion) annually would be resulted. To find out what caused the situation, a contrastive study has been conducted on refrigerants thermal prop- erties, system cycling performances, etc. R134a used in automobiles may not be a key factor for such a negative result, but the AC com- pressors may be evidently a prominent consideration. A realistic prediction for the EER rating on automotive application is 8, which would result in a $4.05 billion saving per year and a $5.4 billion if it reaches 10. 2001-01-2482. (SP- 1637) Assessing the fuel economy potential of light-duty vehicles. Feng An and John DeCicco, Consultant; and Marc Ross, University of Michigan. This paper assesses the potential for car and light truck fuel econ- omy improvements by 2010-15. We examine a range of refinements to body systems and powertrain, reflecting current best practice as well as emerging technologies such as advanced engine and trans- mission, lightweight materials, integrated starter-generators, and hybrid drive. Engine options are restricted to those already known to meet upcoming California emissions standards. Our approach is to apply a state-of-art vehicle system simulation model to assess vehicle fuel economy gains and performance levels. We select a set of baseline vehicles representing five major classes - Small and Standard Cars, Pickup Trucks, SUVs and Minivans - and analyze design changes likely to be commercially viable within the coming decade. Results vary by vehicle type. A moderate package of con- ventional technology improvements yields fuel economy increases of 37% for a full-size pickup to 70% for a standard-performance midsize SUV, averaging 47% overall for a 5% increase in average vehicle price. Greater degrees of improvement are feasible at higher cost, with more than doubled fuel economy possible using full hybrid drive. 2001-01-2484.

Leakage and permeability through fuel systems is an ongoing problem that both environmentalists and automakers face, but with the application of multi-layer plastic material technology and new manufacturing processes of internalizing components, partial zero emissions vehicles (PZEV) can be achieved. The legislative require- ments that must be met for the future fuel systems regarding their permeation and leakage performance are discussed.

(SP- 1634) A new concept of supercharging applied to high-speed DI diesel engines. G. Cantore, E. Mattarelli, and S. Fontanesi, University of Modena and Reggio E. The supercharging system investigated in this study is made up of a traditional turbocharger, coupled with a Roots-type positive dis- placement compressor. An electrically actuated clutch allows the compressor to be disengaged from the engine at high speed and under partial load steady operations (such as the ones occurring in a driving cycle). This concept of supercharging has been applied to the downsiz- ing of a reference engine (a 2.5 liter, turbocharged, four-cylinder, high-speed DI diesel engine), without penalization on the maximum brake power (110 kW) and transient response. For such a purpose, a 'paper' engine has been theoretically char- acterized. The gross engine parameters have been optimized by means of 1-D numerical simulations, using a computational model previously validated against experiments. Performances of the reference and the downsized engine have been compared, considering both steady and transient operating conditions, full and partial load. The two-stage supercharging sys- tem allows the 'paper' engine to provide higher values of torque at low engine speed and full load, and to perform slightly better in terms of transient response. Furthermore, when considering operat- ing conditions occurring in the European Driving cycle (Roots com- pressor disengaged), the downsized engine shows lower fuel con- sumption (from 6 to 24%), and lower pollutant emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2486. (SP- 1634) Design of internal combustion engine piston based on skirt lubrication analysis. Junwei Yang, Xudong Yu , and Chengtao Wang, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ. Many piston parameters and the profile of piston skirt should be optimized in order to get the best lubrication. To attain optimized parameters, a lubrication analysis of piston skirt was carried out. After having investigated the real condition, a numerical lubrication model was established and computer programs were worked out to simulate the performance of skirt, and every parameter can be modi- fied to optimize the whole skirt parameters. In addition, an equip- ment to measure the oil film thickness between piston and bore was developed to verify the numerical simulation model. Because vari- ous parameters, like radial clearance, piston surface profile, piston pin offset, and skirt length, made experiments too difficulty to implement, the program simulation become exercisable and eco- nomical method. Through the simulation a group of optimized pis- ton parameters could be obtained easily. 2001-01-2489. (SP- 1634) Gas engine combustion principles and applications. Simon K. Chen, PEI Consultants ; and N. John Beck, Clean Air Partners. Modern commercial dual-fuel engines operating in gas mode has the same level of fuel efficiency as the diesel mode. The NOx emis- sions level is reduced tenfold and satisfies the most stringent Euro- pean 1/2 TA-Luft regulation. THC emissions can be controlled by the oxidation-catalytic process. High-efficiency low-NOx emissions gas engine performance is achieved by the following: Same power cylinder components as the basic diesel; Retarded timing together with short heat release duration by using Micropilot/Microcup designs; Lean lambda of 2.0 to 2.2; Minimal pilot fuel, 1% or less; Centrally located ignition if practical; Low air charge temperature at high load for high BMEP; 20-30% lower lambda at part load (compared to full load) achieved by compressed air bypass, skipfire, or variable geometry turbo. This paper provides only a qualitative treatise on gas engine combustion and the effects of fuel quality and engine design on combustion. Additional research is warranted. 2001-01-2490.

The paper presents the results of liquid fuel radial distribution measurements of 25 different spray cross-sections at various dis- tances from the injection nozzle. The measurements showed that fuel drops, sprayed into the air, evaporated and the spray diameter increased. The calculation of evaporated fuel quantity was based on the volume of injected fuel and the amount of liquid fuel measured in each spray cross-section. For the purpose of measuring the liquid fuel in a spray we developed 317</page><page sequence="317">200 1 -0 1 -2490-200 1 -0 1 -2496 a device using ring electrodes to measure electric charge of the fuel, resulting from fuel rubbing against the injection nozzle metal parts and the measuring device electrodes. The temperature gradient in the ring electrode is caused by droplets hitting it at the velocity of 100 to 300 m/s. Their kinetic energy is instantly transformed into the thermal energy the consequence of which is the temperature gra- dient in the ring electrode. The crystal in which the temperature gra- dient exists is minor generator of electric charge. The electric charge was then led to a charge amplifier, where it was converted into elec- tric current. Numerous tests proved good linearity and reliability of the measuring method. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2491. (SP- 1634) Step forward in diesel engine emis- sions reduction: System incorporating a novel low-emission die- sel fuel combined with a diesel oxidation catalyst. Paul D. Basar ; David A. Duncan , and Deborah A. Langer, Lubrizol Corp. Water-emulsified diesel fuel technology has been proven to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) simulta- neously at relatively low cost compared to other pollution-reducing strategies. The value of this technology is that it requires absolutely no engine adjustments or modifications to reduce harmful emis- sions. Technologies that break the NOx-particulate trade-off are vir- tually non-existent, therefore understanding how the water con- tained in an emulsified fuel can reduce both NOx and PM simulta- neously is critical. To understand this phenomenon, emulsified fuels with varying water levels (0 to 20%) were evaluated in a multi-cylinder marine engine using three different injection timings. This testing in an actual engine confirms that as the water level is increased the amount of NOx and PM are reduced without compromising engine performance. Furthermore, injection timing can be changed in con- junction with using an emulsified fuel to further optimize engine performance and decrease emissions. In addition to engine optim- ization, water-emulsified fuel in combination with a DOC was tested and was shown to reduce particulate emissions greater than each technology separately and nearing the level typically offered with a diesel particulate trap. Recent work on the health and environmental effects of particu- lates indicates that not only can particulates be deleterious to health but they may be more significant than previously thought in their impact on global warming. This highlights the relevance of this paper in addressing the benefits of emulsion fuels and the timeliness of this technology with regard to the reduction of emissions from diesel vehicles. Data are presented from the laboratory environment, with engine and chassis dynamometer testing, through to the real world which show that emulsion fuels are a viable technology to reduce emissions from a range of vehicles now. 2001-01-2492. (SP- 1633) Engine start characteristics of two hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) - Honda Insight and Toyota Prius. Henry K. Ng, John A. Anderson, Michael J. Duoba, and Rob- ert P. Larsen, Ar gonne National Laboratory. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) may have key fuel economy and emissions advantages over current conventional vehicles, but they have drawbacks such as frequent engine starts that can slow down market penetration of HEVs. First, the hydrocarbon emissions due to the numerous engine starts would make newly developed HEV powertrains even more demanding on the emission control system. Second, frequent starts may make the engine deteriorate quickly. This study is an attempt to gain a better understanding of the engine start characteristics of two limited-production HEVs (Toyota Prius and Honda Insight). Using fast-response (5 ms) hydrocarbon and NO (nitric oxide) analyzers, the transient emissions were measured in the engine exhaust ports during cold and hot engine starts. On the basis of the experimental findings, several recommendations were made to improve performance and emissions of future HEVs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2493. (SP-1633) Testing and modeling of variable airgap axial flux brushless dc motor. Joel Jermakian, New Gener- ation Motors Corp.; and Mohd-Syaifuddin Mohd and Vahid Mot- evalli, George Washington Univ. This paper describes the performance characterization and mod- eling of New Generation Motors Corporation (NGM) axial flux brushless dc motors (BDCMs). The NGM Solar Car Motor (SCM- 150) was tested at different airgaps using a computer-controlled servo with position feedback. Based on the test results, an opera- tional map was developed as a function of speed and torque range of the motor. The experimental results demonstrated that a highly efficient (&gt;90%) operation for the entire operating envelop of the motor is possible with dynamic gap control. Detailed discussion of the test results, empirical relations between the main operating parameters of axial flux BDCM (torque, speed, airgap) and the resulting output (power output, maximum torque, power loss, maxi- mum speed, efficiency) are described in this paper. A scalable model for the motor performance using variable airgap was devel- oped and included in the ADVISOR model to simulate hybrid- electric sedan meeting PNGV goals. 2001-01-2494. (SP-1633) Current-compensated discharge limiter for industrial battery-powered vehicle. Garrett P. Beau- regard and Donald B. Karner, Electric Transportation Engineering Corp.; and Shunjiro Ohba, Soleq Corp. Battery-powered vehicles require that driveable range be maxi- mized. This requirement is at odds with the need to protect the bat- tery from over charge and over discharge. This is especially true when the electric vehicle operator is not sufficiently knowledgeable about battery operation. Several technologies were examined to pre- vent excessive discharge during operation of a luggage tractor. None of the existing technologies were found to be appropriate for this application. A new scheme was developed whereby battery terminal voltage is compensated by discharge current. By carefully selecting the control curve relative to the internal resistance of the battery, dis- charge energy output is maximized while still providing protection against excessive discharge. A device was developed using this new scheme. The device was developed as an external interface with a specific motor controller and used the accelerator command signal to limit power drawn from the battery as the means of discharge con- trol. Vehicle testing with the discharge-limiting device showed that the new scheme allows for sufficient energy output from the battery while providing gradually increasing power limitation to protect the battery. 2001-01-2496. (SP- 1636) Variable shift schedule control for integrated starter generator equipped hybrid vehicles. Daniel S. Denton, Visteon Corporation. In this study, conducted during 42V product development by Visteon, a Variable Shift Schedule (VSS) control strategy was designed and tested on a vehicle equipped with an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) and a step ratio automatic transmission. The strat- egy incorporates two ratio change points (a high point and a low point) for a given vehicle speed and driver demand torque (mea- sured by throttle position). By evaluating battery state of charge (SOC) and torque boost available from the electric drive system, the strategy can interpolate the earliest point for a change in ratio. It can also choose to 'lock' the torque converter elements within the auto- matic transmission (AT) while continuing to provide consistent vehicle performance. The result is the ability to operate the internal combustion (IC) engine in a range of greater efficiency during the up-shift sequence. In addition the automatic transmission is able to remain in higher ratio ranges for extended durations. This effec- tively creates a vehicle that operates at levels of greater fuel effi- ciency and lower emissions. Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) modeling experiments are carried out to prove the validity of the proposed transmission control strategy and support the claims. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 318</page><page sequence="318">2001-01-2497-2001-01-2503 2001-01-2497.

A demonstration inverter has been built to illustrate the feasibil- ity of implementing an ISA inverter in a 42V automotive powernet using discrete semiconductor switches. The high current carrying capability of the package (300A) enables the component count to be reduced to a minimum of two per switch. For a lOkW inverter, the current carrying requirements of each switch is about 400A peak. With careful layout and design, this solution could be a viable alternative to a module solution, which typically would have the same FET component count. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2498.

Previously, the power conversion operation of a bi-directional 42 volt to 14 volt converter for a dual voltage automobile electrical sys- tem was described. Often, DC/DC converters are designed with protection circuits; both to protect the converter against external mishaps and to protect the external input and output connected devices against internal con- trol loss. Here, the converter function would normally be under the control of an external computer. In this paper, an elementary direc- tional control system is proposed as a backup in case of failure of the external power management computer. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2500. (SP- 1636) 42 V electric air conditioning sys- tems (E-A/CS) for low emissions, architecture, comfort and safety of next-generation vehicles. Gwénaël Guyonvarch, Chris- tophe Aloup, Christophe Petitjean, and Antoine de Monts de Savasse, Valeo Climate Control. Electrical Air Conditioning Systems for 42 V vehicles will pro- vide many benefits in terms of Environment protection, car Archi- tecture, cabin Comfort and overall Safety. E-A/C Systems essentially differ from conventional ones by the use of electrical compressors. First of all, they will be particularly well adapted to new powertrains, helping to make them more environmentally friendly. Accurate control and high efficiency under the most common ther- mal conditions will reduce the A/C impact on fuel consumption. Besides, higher sealing integrity will cut emissions of refrigerant during normal operation and maintenance. Secondly, the use of an electrically driven compressor (EDC) will suppress a belt, and will reduce the packaging constraints. This will help to design new vehicle architectures. Thirdly, the electrification of air conditioning will allow better thermal comfort. In particular, E-A/C Systems provide a good opportunity for cabin pre-conditioning. Finally, safety will be improved thanks to better thermal comfort and visibility, and thanks to better mass distribution allowing better crash-test behavior. 2001-01-2501. (SP- 1637) Comparative study of hybrid powertrain strategies. Jim Walters, Harry Husted, and Kaushik Rajashekara, Delphi Automotive Systems. Hybrid electric vehicles have the potential to reduce air pollution and improve fuel economy without sacrificing the present conve- niences of long range and available infrastructure that conventional vehicles offer. Hybrid vehicles are generally classified as series or parallel hybrids. A series hybrid vehicle is essentially an electric vehicle with an on-board source of power for charging the batteries. In a parallel hybrid vehicle, the engine and the electric motor can be used to drive the vehicle simultaneously. There are various possi- ble configurations of parallel hybrid vehicles depending on the role of the electric motor/generator and the engine. In this paper, a comparative study of the drivetrains of five differ- ent hybrid vehicles is presented. The underlying design architectures are examined, with analysis as to the tradeoffs and advantages repre- sented in these architectures. Where appropriate, comparisons to five popular non-hybrid vehicles are made to give the reader a sense of perspective. The primary drivetrain components of engine, trans- mission, electric machine, inverter, and battery pack are evaluated and changes to the user interface paradigm are highlighted. Based on the comparative study, hybrid drivetrain technology strategies for future vehicles are proposed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2502. Assessment of hybrid configuration and con- trol strategies in planning future metropolitan/urban transit systems. Tom Ciccarelli, Lawrence Technological Univ.; Reza Toossi, California State University, Long Beach ; and Abas Goo- darzi, Enova Systems. Simulation studies are performed to evaluate the potential fuel savings and reduction in emissions from using hybrid-powered buses on Long Beach City bus routes. Conventional diesels, diesel- hybrid, and gas turbine-hybrids with different configurations are considered. The results of these studies are compared with experi- mental data and are generally in good agreement. Fuel economy is shown to be dependent on the bus hybrid system configuration, component sizing as well as the bus route, with a potential fuel econ- omy improvement of as much as 80%. Emissions are also substan- tially lowered if hybrid buses equipped with diesels or gas turbines are deployed. Depending on the mission, driving patterns, and road conditions, different control strategies demonstrate different results. The project objective was to investigate the feasibility of utiliz- ing a fleet of medium- and large-size hybrid passenger vans in met- ropolitan/urban areas to improve the overall fuel efficiency, reduce emission, and increase throughput without increasing cost life of the system - thus allowing additional routes to areas where such ser- vices are most needed. This is done by allowing fleets consisting of a mix of vehicles such as hybrids and internal combustion engines to operate. 2001-01-2503. (SP- 1637) Sulfur poisoning and desulfation of the lean NOx trap. J. Li, J. R. Theis, W. Chun, C. T. Góralski, R. J. Kudla, W. L. Watkins, and R. H. Hurley, Ford Research Labora- tories. Lean NOx traps (LNT) are currently the technology of choice for treating the NOx emissions from lean-burn gasoline engines. With the help of the newly established low sulfur fuel to be introduced in the European and the U.S. markets, the widespread application of LNT technology becomes more promising. However, we found that the sulfur tolerance of aged LNTs is much lower than that of the fresh LNTs. Moreover, the aged LNTs are more difficult to be desulfated relative to the fresh ones. The robustness of the LNT still needs to be improved. 319</page><page sequence="319">2001-01-2503-2001-01-2508 This work is focused on understanding the fundamental pro- cesses of sulfur poisoning and desulfation as the trap ages. Three LNT samples were selected from different suppliers. These samples were subject to different aging conditions. Flow reactor and pulse flame combustor tests were conducted on the samples to evaluate their performances with regard to sulfur poisoning and desulfation. The samples were further characterized using different techniques including TPR, H2/CO2 chemisorption, FTIR, XRD, etc. Interac- tions of sulfur with active components of the trap such as precious metal, barium, and cerium are correlated with the performance of the traps. Significant loss of surface barium sites occurs upon aging. This is extremely detrimental since sulfur preferentially attaches to these limited remaining sites, resulting in accelerated sulfur poisoning of the trap. Because of the loss of surface area upon aging, bulk sulfate forms not only with barium, but also with cerium. The formation of cerium sulfate significantly inhibits the water gas shift reaction in generating H2, which makes the desulfation of the aged samples with bulk barium sulfates much more difficult. 2001-01-2504. (SP- 1637) Improved performance and reduced emissions in a D. I. engine by fuel additives. Ar. Sharavanan, D. Jaishanker, and C. G. Saravanan, Annamalai Univ. Diesel Engineers are major sources of prime movers, which are widely used for small- and large-scale power generation and trans- portation purposes. These engines are widely used owing to its high power output and general thermal efficiency. In spite of these bene- fits diesel engines cause serious environmental and human discom- forts on global scale. The important pollutants from a diesel engine are NOx, HC and particulate matter. These particulates are inhalable, capable of travelling deep into lungs and causing diseases. As a result of this governments and health organizations have tightened the standards for pollutants from diesel engine. Hence it has become important that these particulate matters have to be reduced or elimi- nated from the exhaust of diesel engines. This project aims to reduce the particulate emission in the diesel engine exhaust and to improve the performance of the engine. A lit- erature survey conducted revealed that using fuel additives, which oxygenate the fuel and reduces the emissions, can reduce the partic- ulate emission. Additives like ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dieth- ylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, butyl ether, aliphatic alcohol, aromatic alcohol and glycol ethers were used by various researchers in this field, as fuel additives. Encourag- ing results were obtained and some of them are reported in this proj- ect. In these oxygenates, ethers behave better than alcohols. Hence for this present work some of the ethers were selected which were not much tried and details were not much known. Three additives were selected for the fuel. Diethylene glycol mono butyl ether, diethylene glycol mono butyl ether, diethylene glycol mono- n-hexyl ether and dibutyl ether are the additives selected. A single- cylinder direct injection diesel engine (Greaves cotton engine) was selected for conducting the tests. These oxygenates were added in different quantities to the selected base fuel, diesel. Load tests and speed tests were conducted first with the sole fuel (diesel) and then with the smoke emissions were deduced to a very great extent, the maximum reduction was obtained while using 4 ml of diethylene glycol mono-n-hexyl ether. The smoke level is reduced from 70HSU to 29HSU, the particulate matter is reduced from 2.801 g/hr to 1.512 g/hr and the smoke conversion efficiency is found out as 58.57% at full load. A slight decrease in fuel consumption and about 1 to 2 % increase in brake thermal efficiency was found out from the experiment conducted, for various loads and speeds which shows obviously an improvement in the performance. The other two additives also shows the same trend except that these values slightly differ indicating that dibutyl ether comes as second good additive and diethylene glycol mono butyl ether as third good additive. Detailed results are reported in the results and discussions chapter and conclusions at the end. 2001-01-2505. (SP-1637) Emissions from a Cummins B5.9 diesel engine fueled with oxygenate-in-diesel blends. A. S. (Ed) Cheng and Robert W. Dibble, University of California, Berkeley. Engine fuel tests were conducted with an oxygenated fuel called Cetaner blended with conventional diesel fuel to determine its emis- sions reduction potential. Blends of 10, 20, 30 and 40% by volume were investigated. The test engine was a 1993 Cummins B5.9 diesel rated at 175 hp. Emissions of particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO), along with brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) were measured during steady state operation at eight engine speed-load conditions. Soluble organic fraction (SOF) analysis was also carried out on the collected PM filter samples. The experimental results showed that the Cetaner blends can sub- stantially reduce PM emissions. Reductions were observed in both the organic and inorganic fractions of the collected PM. On a modal- averaged basis, increasing Cetaner blend levels yielded greater PM reductions, with reductions of about 3-4% observed for each 1% of oxygen blended to the fuel by mass. No large changes in NOx emis- sions were observed for the test fuels - on a modal-averaged basis the effect ranged from an 5% decrease to a 2% increase. 2001-01-2506. (SP- 1633) Energy management strategy and parametric design for hybrid electric family sedan. Chu Liang and Wang Qingnian, Jilin Univ. In this paper, the practical configuration of a powertrain for a parallel hybrid electric family sedan (HEFS) is introduced. Based on the analysis of the operation modes, an energy management strat- egy has been developed which can operate the engine within its high-efficiency range as much as possible and keep the battery state of charge (SOC) at a reasonable level. The components of the power unit (including engine, electric motor, battery, transmission and torque coupler) are calculated and discussed in detail according to the vehicle requirements for maximum cruising speed, acceleration time, gradeability, emission, and fuel efficiency. The simulation results show that the sedan would have performance comparable to that of a corresponding conventional sedan, about twice the fuel economy, and a range not limited by the battery storage energy. 2001-01-2507.

This paper presents that low-voltage (42V) current intensive Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM) based traction systems are feasible for lightly hybridized vehicles. Power electronic drive as well as electric machine issues are comprehensively addressed. Five different SRM drivers for low-voltage and high-voltage machines are studied. Suitability of the proposed low-voltage, high-current drives is elaborated. Furthermore, four machines with the rating of 7.5 kW are designed and simulated. These traction machines have 6/4 and 8/6 SRM configurations with the operating voltage of 42V and 300V. Higher torque density is the main advantage of the low- voltage machines compared to the high- voltage machines. In addi- tion, 6/4 SRMs have better performance. 2001-01-2508.

Flowers, Joel Martinez- F rias, and J. Ray Smith, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This paper describes the homogeneous charge compression igni- tion (HCCI) research activities being currently pursued at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and at the University of California Berkeley. Current activities include analysis as well as experimental work. HCCI is an old combustion technology that may now be developed with expectations of high efficiency, low NOx, and low particulate matter emissions; in short, an alternative to diesel engines. On analysis, we have developed two powerful tools: a single- zone model and a multi-zone model. The single-zone model has proven very successful in predicting start of combustion and provid- ing reasonable estimates for peak cylinder pressure, indicated effi- ciency and NOx emissions. This model is being applied to develop detailed engine performance maps and control strategies, and to ana- lyze the problem of engine startability. The multi-zone model is capable of very accurate predictions of the combustion process, including HC and CO emissions. The multi-zone model has applica- bility to the optimization of combustion chamber geometry and operating conditions to achieve controlled combustion at high effi- ciency and low emissions. On experimental work, we have done an evaluation of operating conditions in a 4-cylinder Volkswagen TDI engine. The engine has been operated over a wide range of conditions by adjusting the intake temperature and the fuel flow rate. Satisfactory operation has been obtained over a wide range of operating conditions. Cylinder- to-cylinder variations play an important role in limiting maximum power; expectations are that each cylinder will be individually con- trolled to achieve best performance. 2001-01-2512. (SP-1634) Integration of 3D-CFD and engine cycle simulations: Application to an intake plenum. M. Borghi, E. Mattarelli, and L. Montorsi, University of Modena and Reggio E. The purpose of this paper is to compare different methodologies of CFD analysis, applied to the intake plenum of a turbocharged HSDI diesel engine. The study is performed by using both an engine cycle simulation code and a 3D-CFD code. Experiments at the engine dynamometer and at a steady flow bench support the theoret- ical study. The most promising simulation technique presented in the paper is the integrated ID and 3D-CFD simulation. This numerical approach showed itself to be particularly suitable for analyzing com- plex engine components where the flow patterns are fully transient. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2513. (SP-1634) Performance of Stirling engine hybrid electric vehicles: A simulation approach. Luis Figueroa and Owen R. Fauvel, University of Calgary; and Graham T. Reader, University of Windsor. Hybrid vehicles have gained momentum in the automotive indus- try. The joint action of power sources and energy storage systems for energizing the vehicle improves the vehicle's fuel economy while reducing its pollutant emissions and noise levels, challenging automotive designers to optimize vehicle's cost, weight and control. The marketing success of hybrid vehicles significantly depends on the selection, integration and cost of the energy systems. The internal combustion engine, dominant of the vehicle market, has been the 'option of choice' for auxiliary power unit of the hybrid vehicle, although other power sources as fuel cells, Stirling engines and gas turbines have been employed as well. This document is focused in the application of Stirling engines as the power source for automobile propulsion. In order to optimize this process, a simulation tool for Stirling vehicle was developed based in ADVISOR, a proven hybrid electric vehicle simulation software, and MARWEISS, a Stirling engine simulator. The simulation tool allows the study of Stirling-powered vehicles in conventional or hybrid electric (series, parallel or split) configura- tions, determining parameters of the vehicle like fuel consumption, power output, emissions, energy flow and the engine's temperature profile. The analysis of the simulation results can be employed to identify the critical features of the Stirling-powered vehicle. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2515. (SP-1634) Study of three-dimensional model- ing for fibrous filters with image effect. Shuyi Wang, Shangyu Xie, and Xiancheng Wang, Armored Force Engineering Institute. A fibrous filter made from stainless steel wire net (SSWN) has been developed. This paper studies a 3 -dimensional modeling and computing method for the fibrous filters, with image effect based on the SSWN filter. It takes the exhaust aerosol of a diesel engine as a homogeneous, steady flow composed of exhaust gases and par- ticulates. Under the effect of an electrical force field, the particulates deviate from other gas phase components and deposit on the fibers. Mathematical models for calculating the flow, the electric field, and the capture efficiency are presented in this paper. These mathemati- cal models are used for calculating a two-layer SSWN filter model. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2516. (SP- 1636) A distributed architecture for deliv- ering telematics services. Parvathy Bhaskaran, Motorola, Inc. With the wealth of information available on the Internet, there is a pressing need for a standards-based platform that allows the mobile vehicle to access telematics services that leverage this infor- mation in a safe and consistent manner while minimizing driver dis- traction. This paper discusses a distributed architecture that enables the rapid development and deployment of such services by offload- ing data- and compute-intensive operations to a remote server, while executing location-sensitive and vehicle-centric services on the vehicle. These services may range from safety and diagnostics ser- vices to multi-media infotainment. It further examines how the vari- ous underlying technologies from different spheres such as location, wireless, satellite, Internet and m-Commerce are brought together to complement each other, as well as the relevant emerging stan- dards in each area. The distributed telematics platform will also have the ability to remotely control the installation, removal and update of service applications on a vehicle client, as well as the management of criti- cal resources during their execution to address security concerns. 2001-01-2517. (SP-1636) The role of vision sensors in future intelligent vehicles. Lisa Hamilton, Lawrence Humm, Michele Daniels, and Huan Yen, Delphi Delco Electronics Systems. The advancement in CMOS imaging sensors has enabled low- cost and high-quality cameras that are making their way into future automobiles. Vision sensors can be deployed in a car to perform a variety of functions, including driver monitoring for workload man- agement; passenger monitoring for intelligent airbag deployment; pedestrian and object recognition for precrash sensing; lane marker and roadway tracking for lane/roadway departure warnings; and general scene and object recognition to improve ACC/FCW/CA (adaptive cruise control/forward collision warning/collision avoid- ance) system robustness through sensor fusion. Possible system implementation and key performance requirements for vision sen- sors in these applications are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2518. (SP-1636) A unique approach for data analysis of naturalistic driver behavior. Erik C. B. Olsen and Walter W. Wierwille, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. This paper describes an effort to gather lane-changing and pass- ing driver behavior data using naturalistic observation methods. Par- ticipants were ordinary commuters who drove instrumented vehicles to and from work while data were automatically collected. The three types of data included driver, vehicle response, and vehicle interac- 321</page><page sequence="321">200 1 -0 1 -25 1 8-200 1 -0 1 -2526 tion data via collected video, vehicle sensor, and radar systems. These data were combined using a data integration system to under- stand lane-change and passing maneuvers. Developed specifically for this project, this system allows analysts to understand and char- acterize lane-changing and passing maneuvers by presenting the three types of data in an intuitive, integrated manner. The integrated data will facilitate understanding of driver behavior. This under- standing will assist designers in the development of future crash reduction countermeasures including Crash Avoidance Systems (CAS). 2001-01-2519. (SP- 1636) A new control strategy for vehicle active suspension system using PID and fuzzy logic control. Yu Fan , Li Jun , Feng Jinzhi, and Zhang Jianwu, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ. Since the nonlinearity which inherently exists in vehicle system need to be considered in active suspension control law design, a new control strategy is proposed for active vehicle suspension systems by using a combined control scheme, i.e., respectively using a PID controller and a fuzzy logic controller in two loops. In this paper, the investigation is mainly focused on vehicle ride comfort perfor- mance and simulations in straight running operating condition are presented. The control goal is to minimize vehicle body vertical and pitch accelerations for passenger comfort. The control system con- sists of two parallel control loops. One loop, using PID control, is to minimize vehicle body vertical acceleration; and the fuzzy logic controller is to minimize pitch acceleration and meanwhile to atten- uate vehicle body vertical acceleration further by tuning weighting factors. Based on a four-degree-of-freedom nonlinear vehicle model, the algorithm is implemented and simulations are carried out in different road disturbance input conditions. Simulation results show that the control strategy is very effective in reducing peak val- ues of vehicle body accelerations, especially within the most sensi- tive frequency range of human response and also with good stability even if the system is subject to a discrete event input, i.e., a sudden change of road conditions, such as a pothole, an obstacle or a step input. Compared with conventional passive suspensions and an active vehicle suspension by using a linear and fuzzy logic controls, the new designed control system can improve vehicle ride comfort performance significantly and offer better system robustness. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2520. (SP- 1636) An accurate simple model for vehi- cle handling using reduced-order model techniques. Chul Kim , General Motors Corp.; and Paul I. Ro, North Carolina State Univ. In this paper, an approach to obtain an accurate yet simple model for vehicle handling is proposed. The approach involves linearizing a full-car MBD model and dividing the large-order system states into two groups depending on their effect on ride quality and han- dling performance. Then, the singular perturbation method is used to reduce the model size and to compensate for the steady-state rela- tionship between the two state groups. Based on simulation using ADAMS, the results show an accurate matching between the reduced model and the original MBD model. The benefits of the approach are illustrated by comparing step responses with the con- ventional nominal model. Also, the reduced-order model obtained by the proposed approach resulted in improved performances under sliding mode control even with smaller switching gains than what are required for the conventional bicycle model. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-2521. (SP- 1634) Advanced automotive propulsion systems - Alternatives, combinations and trends. Cornel Stan , West Saxon University of Zwickau. The worldwide demand for vehicles, respectively for their diver- sity, corresponding to specific utilizations, increases continuously. On the other hand, the energy resources, the ecological aspects and the traffic flow lead to severe requirements to every new vehicle and propulsion system. Between necessities, specific utilization aspects and requirements, numerous configurations of propulsion systems are conceivable. This paper presents a classification of conventional and advanced propulsion systems and of their combination concepts in base of following criteria: energy resources, ecological aspects, technical feasibility, expected costs. The paper gives an overview of different propulsion systems and of the required energy form - including storage or conversion on board. Going from this overview basic concepts such as advanced IC engines and their energy sources, electric motors, including the energy storage or conversion systems as well as advantageous hybrid configurations are dis- cussed.

(SP- 1634) Development of a throttleless natu- ral gas engine. John T. Kubesh, Southwest Research Institute. Development of a natural gas-fueled engine capable of throttle- less operation is discussed in this paper. This development was con- ducted under a program funded by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to investigate methods to increase the efficiency of natu- ral gas engines. In-cy linder fuel-air charge stratification was pur- sued as the mechanism for throttleless operation. Various methods of charge stratification were investigated, including direct injection, stratified charge (DISC) and a fuel injected prechamber (FIPC). The FIPC combustion system was found to be a more practical solution to the problem of charge stratification. Performance and emissions results from this engine configuration are presented and compari- sons are made between current natural gas engines and the prototype FIPC engine. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-2524. (SP- 1634) Diffusive combustion of fuel spray in a DI gasoline engine. Shuyi Wang , Shangyu Xie, and Qingguo Luo, Armored Force Engineering Institute. The direct-injection gasoline engine (DIGE) is a new kind of ICE. How to compute and visualize the combustion is a new issue. This paper presents a new method to compute and visualize diffu- sive combustion in a DIGE. This method is based on a three- dimensional staggered grid. A zero-dimensional combustion model with sequential multi-point combustion is used for the elements of the fuel spray. The transient flow and pressure field caused by com- bustion may be determined by calculating the combustion processes of multi-points. This paper takes the DIGE as the studying example, calculating and visualizing the combustion process. 2001-01-2525. (SP-1633) Investigation of hybrid drive trains for railway vehicles. Sebastien E.

These drive trains allow achieving a minimum fuel con- sumption by properly matching the driving requirements and the engine characteristics. In this paper the authors analyze the possibility of extending this concept to railway vehicles. Basic hybrid railway vehicles are designed and discussed. 2001-01-2526. (SP-1633) Design issues of the switched reluc- tance motor drive for propulsion and regenerative braking in EV and HEV. Hongwei Gao , Yimin Gao , and Mehrdad Ehsani, Texas A&amp;M Univ. There is a growing interest in electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EV and HEV) due to their high efficiency and low emission. In EV and HEV, the characteristic of the traction motor is essential for the performance and efficiency of the EV and HEV. In this paper, the advantages of the extended constant power range characteristic of the traction motor for both propulsion and regenerative braking are analyzed. Simulation results are presented to verify the conclusions. Due to its several inherent advantages, especially its capability of having an extended constant power range, a switched reluctance 322</page><page sequence="322">2001-01-2526-2001-01-2532 motor (SRM) is proposed as the candidate of the traction motor in EV and HEV.

(SP- 1635) Hydrogen fuel through PEM elec- trolysis. Robert J. Friedland ', Thomas M. Moloney, and Fred Mitlitsky, Proton Energy Systems , Inc. This paper provides an overview of a Proton Exchange Mem- brane (PEM) hydrogen fueling apparatus. This apparatus generates hydrogen at elevated pressure and stores the gas in high pressure tubes. PEM hydrogen generation offers a practical, low-risk, near- term solution for meeting the needs of early hydrogen vehicles. The systems are modular, easily scalable, proven technology, safe, reli- able and currently being produced for a variety of Industrial Gas applications. In addition to the practicality of PEM electrolysis, pure hydrogen offers many advantages. The only impurity in the gas stream is water vapor, making it the only route to zero-emission vehicles. The system is a low-temperature operation, which offers instant start capability. The system requires only water and electricity as process inputs, making every gas station a viable candidate for this process. Lastly, a strong push into near-term markets, and a synergy with PEM fuel cells are continually strengthening the economic viability of electrolysis. 2001-01-2528. (SP- 1635) Hydrogen vehicle fueling alterna- tives: An analysis developed for the International Energy Agency. Susan M. Schoenung , Longitude 122 West , Inc. Vehicles fueled by hydrogen produce virtually no pollutant emis- sions and are projected to become a serious alternative to hydrocar- bon-fueled vehicles in the future. Current vehicle designs produce power by consuming hydrogen in either a fuel cell or a spark- ignition engine. Hydrogen can be stored on-board as either a com- pressed gas or a cryogenic liquid. Hydrogen-fueled vehicles need a ready source of fuel for routine use. The infrastructure to provide convenient fueling for passenger vehicles must be put in place in the near future, both in the US and internationally. Options for provid- ing hydrogen fuel include electrolysis of water, reforming of hydro- carbon fuels at the fueling station; and transport of bulk hydrogen. This paper presents results of comparative analysis for passenger vehicle fueling options using either liquid or gaseous hydrogen. 2001-01-2529. (SP- 1635) A sodium borohydride on-board hydrogen generator for powering fuel cell and internal combus- tion engine vehicles. Richard M. Mohring and Rex E. Luzader, Mil- lennium Cell , Inc. Hydrogen gas, H2, is the environmentally desirable fuel of choice for powering fuel cells and internal combustion engines. However, hydrogen is extremely difficult to store, handle, and transport. One major hurdle to commercializing hydrogen-powered vehicles is pro- viding a way to effectively and safely generate, store, and deliver the large amounts of H2 needed to achieve acceptable vehicle range while minimizing the weight and volume of the storage system. Mil- lennium Cell has developed a novel catalytic process that generates high purity H2 gas from air-stable, non-flammable, hydrogen-rich water-based solutions of sodium borohydride, NaBJL. This on- board system has already been used by Millennium Cell to success- fully power a hydrogen-powered series-hybrid sport utility vehicle, a full-size six-passenger sedan with an internal combustion engine running on hydrogen gas, and is currently being installed into a fuel cell vehicle. 2001-01-2530.

SAE paper 2001-01-2530 described the details of converting a gasoline-powered 427 Shelby Cobra to run on gaseous hydrogen. The purpose of this project was to design a vehicle capable of beat- ing the current land speed record for hydrogen powered vehicles. The vehicle uses a modified 427 Ford FE engine as the power- plant and a specially designed electronic fuel injection system for metering the hydrogen gas. The engine was designed to produce near zero emissions (&lt;10 ppm of NOx) at approximately 200 HP using a lean burn, 'quality controlled,' fueling strategy (no pollution control devices are utilized). This paper describes the land speed record attempt and the modi- fication made to the vehicle since the last publication. 2001-01-2531. (SP- 1635) Compressed hydrogen storage for fuel cell vehicles. Monterey R. Gardiner, J. Cunningham, and R. M. Moore, University of California, Davis. Near term (ca. 2005) Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) will primarily utilize Direct-Hydrogen Fuel Cell (DHFC) systems. The primary goal of this study was to provide an analytical basis for including a realistic Compressed Hydrogen Gas (CHG) fuel supply simulation within an existing dynamic DHFC system and vehicle model. The purpose of this paper is to provide a tutorial describing the process of modeling a hydrogen storage system for a fuel cell vehi- cle. Three topics were investigated to address the delivery character- istics of H2: temperature change (AT), non-ideal gas characteristics at high pressures, and the maximum amount of hydrogen available due to the CHG storage tank effective 4state-of-charge' (SOC) ~ i.e., how much does the pressure drop between the tank and the fuel cell stack reduce the usable H2 in the tank. The Joule-Thomson coefficient provides an answer to the expected AT during expansion of the H2 from 5000 psi to 45 psi. The temperature change, however, was found to be negligible with regard to fuel cell thermal control issues. The departure from the ideal gas law was evaluated using the Redlich-Kwong equation of state. This provides the most accurate description of the PV=nRT relationship for simple equations of state. The pressure drop must be calculated from a number of factors such as: pipe material, bends within the pipe, length of pipe, and the number of valves (pressure regulators) the gas must pass through. The pressure drop and initial tank volume are used to calculate the remaining hydrogen - and hence the effective SOC for the CHG storage tank. Primary results for the CHG fuel systems considered include: the temperature shows a change of ca. 13 K, the initial volume was cal- culated to be 264 liters (69.7 gallons) for 6 kg of H2 stored at ambi- ent temperature and 5000 psi, and the usable H2 depends on the pres- sure drop within the specific fuel system design. The system was used within an existing dynamic FCV model for fuel cell vehicle analyses. 2001-01-2532. (SP- 1634) Systematic design of fuel cell- powered hybrid vehicle drive train. Yimin Gao and Mehrdad Ehsani, Texas A&amp;M Univ. A general design methodology of the fuel cell-powered hybrid vehicle drive train has been developed. With the methodology and a computer simulation program, all of the systematic parameters can be designed, such as, the rated power of the electric motor drive, fuel cell system, peaking power source as well as the energy capacity. An overall control strategy has also been developed. The main func- tion of the control strategy is to properly control the power produced by the fuel cell system and the peaking power source, so as to meet the power demand, maintain the energy level of the peaking power source in its optimal region and operate the fuel cell system within its high efficiency region. In this paper, a design example has also been introduced in each section. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 323</page><page sequence="323">200 1 -0 1 -25 33- 200 1 -0 1 -25 3 8 2001-01-2533. (SP- 1634) Co-simulation of electrical and pro- pulsion systems. John A. MacBain , Delphi Automotive Systems; Joseph J. Conover, EDS at Delphi Automotive Systems; and Valerie H. Johnson , National Renewable Energy Laboratory. One of the challenges of analyzing vehicular electrical systems is the co-dependence of the electrical system and the propulsion sys- tem. Even in traditional vehicles where the electrical power budget is very low, the electrical system analysis for macro power utiliza- tion over a drive cycle requires knowledge of the generator shaft rpm profile during the drive cycle. This co-dependence increases as the electrical power budget increases, and the integration of the two systems becomes complete when hybridization is chosen. Last year at this conference, the authors presented a paper enti- tled 'Dual Voltage Electrical System Simulations.' That paper established validation for a suite of electrical component models and demonstrated the ability to predict system performance both on a macro power flow (entire drive cycle) level and a detailed transient- event level. The techniques were applicable to 12V, 42V, dual volt- age, and/or elevated voltage systems. The weakness of applying those electrical system analyses to real vehicles on drive cycles has already been noted. The required generator shaft rpm profile can only come from an analysis of the propulsion system. ADVISOR® (ADvanced Vehicle SimulatOR) is a well estab- lished program from NREL (National Renewable Energy Labora- tory) which analyzes the propulsion systems of both traditional and hybrid vehicles at the macro power flow level. As such, ADVISOR can provide the missing information required for electrical analyses. Likewise, ADVISOR could benefit from more detailed information concerning the load the electrical system places on the propulsion system. If this information transfer is done in a co-simulation envi- ronment, all of the necessary information can be passed bi- directionally between the propulsion system and the electrical sys- tem. This paper details the development of a co-simulation environ- ment between ADVISOR (based in MATLAB®/SIMULINK®) and Delphi Automotive' s electrical system analysis in SABER®. The end goal of this work is a full integration of electrical analysis into the ADVISOR structure which is transparent to the end user. This paper will demonstrate the ability to co-simulate the propul- sion and electrical systems for traditional vehicles. Various load models (i.e., voltage dependent current sinks) will represent the power requirements of hardware. The paper will also provide a road- map for extensions of this work into the hybrid vehicle realm. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2534.

The objective of this paper is to examine the state-of-the-art tech- nologies driving the development of advanced electronic chassis control systems. In addition, the paper provides an overview of how the future systems will function and reveals the benefits to the con- sumer by these advanced solutions. Advanced electronic chassis control systems naturally segment into several categories including advanced electronic braking sys- tems, advanced electronic steering systems, electronic suspension systems, and collision warning/avoidance systems. Together, these intelligent, automated, vehicle control systems offer the consumer a safer driving experience with a higher performing, more fuel effi- cient, and environmentally friendly automobile. Key enabling technologies to support these systems include low- cost, robust 'failsafe' solutions, high-performance processors capa- ble of signal processing, a whole array of new sensor technology and a new high-speed serial communications protocol which will be highly dependable. All of these new technologies will be discussed from a perspective of how they enable the electronic chassis control system. 2001-01-2535. (SP- 1634) Measuring yaw rate with accelerom- eters. Wonshik Chee, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. This paper presents a new way of measuring yaw rate of the vehi- cle using two accelerometers. Measurement of yaw rate is inevitable for vehicle stability control systems for contemporary high- performance sedans and automatic steering control systems for intelligent vehicles. Compared with accelerometers, the cost of rate gyros used to measure the yaw rate is significantly higher. As an economical software solution to replace the high-cost rate gyros with minimal additional hardware, an algorithm to obtain yaw rate using two accelerometers is proposed in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2536. The new PNGV system analysis toolkit PSAT V4.1 - Evolution and improvement. Aymeric Rousseau , Sylvain Pagerit, Gilles Monnet, and An Feng , Ar gonne National Labora- tory. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), working with the Partner- ship for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), maintains hybrid vehicle simulation software, the PNGV System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). PSAT, originally proprietary, has been used by both DOE and the 'Big Three' as a modeling tool. The number of PSAT users has increased recently because 15 universities participating in the 2001 FutureTruck competition were given the software for their use. PSAT allows companies to look at new types of vehicles (hybrids) and choose the best configuration according to customer expecta- tions within a minimum of time. PSAT, a forward-looking model, allows the user to simulate a large number of different configura- tions (conventional, series, parallel, and power split). PSAT is well suited for development of control strategies; by using accurate dynamics component models as its code, PSAT can be implemented directly and tested at the bench scale or in a vehicle. In this paper, we describe the updated software organization and its new capabili- ties, including new engine models, a Graphical User Interface, and 4WD configurations. In this way, we demonstrate the increased flexibility and reusability of PSAT. 2001-01-2537. Test results and modeling of the Honda Insight using ADVISOR. Kenneth J. Kelly and Matthew Zolot, National Renewable Energy Laboratory ; and Gerard Glinsky and Arthur Hieronymus, Environmental Testing Corp. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has con- ducted a series of chassis dynamometer and road tests on the 2000 model-year Honda Insight. This paper will focus on results from the testing, how the results have been applied to NREL' s Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR), and how test results compare to the model predictions and published data. The chassis dynamometer testing included the FTP-75 emissions certification test procedure, highway fuel economy test, US06 aggressive driving cycle con- ducted at 0°C, 20°C, and 40°C, and the SC03 test performed at 35°C with the air conditioning on and with the air conditioning off. Data collection included bag and continuously sampled emissions (for the chassis tests), engine and vehicle operating parameters, battery cell temperatures and voltages, motor and auxiliary currents, and cabin temperatures. Test results are being used in three NREL program areas including: correlation and enhancement of the ADVISOR model; understanding battery performance under various conditions and the development of a temperature dependent battery pack model; and to determine the effect of air conditioning on fuel econ- omy and emissions from highly efficient vehicles. Results from the testing have shown good agreement with predicted behavior and published data. Detailed test data have also yielded important insights into the vehicle control strategies and component perfor- mance that have been incorporated into ADVISOR. 2001-01-2538.

The importance of component models and the complexity involved in setting up optimized control strategies require validation of the models and controls developed in PSAT. Using ANL' s Advanced Powertrain Test Facilities (APTF), more than 50 tests on the Honda Insight were used to validate the PSAT drivetrain config- uration. Extensive instrumentation, including the half-shaft torque sensor, provides the data needed for thorough comparison of model results and test data. In this paper, we will first describe the process and the type of test used to validate the models. Then we will explain the tuning of the simulated vehicle control strategy, based on the analysis of the differences between test and simulation. Finally, we will demonstrate the validation of the PSAT Insight component models and control strategy using Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (HEV) test data. 2001-01-2541. Practical vehicular gas turbines. Robin Mackay, Consultant. Microturbines are being successfully used in production hybrid electric buses. They are economically sound while demonstrating long life with dramatically reduced maintenance and emissions. However, to reach high production in a broad range of vehicles, cer- tain improvements will be needed. These include lower first cost, much faster response time and higher efficiency into the 40% range at both full load and part load. This paper addresses these challenges and their solutions while using technology that mostly exists. 2001-01-2543. Modular recuperator design for small gas tur- bines. Fred E. Faulkner , Thermodynamics Analysis Service. Small gas turbine/electric generators are currently being devel- oped for emergency power, for remote locations where power is not available, and for cogeneration where exhaust heat is used for indus- trial processes and the electrical power is used to offset utility power. With the shortage of power in many locations such as Cali- fornia, it is even more important to develop efficient small electrical generating equipment. This paper describes a modular recuperator design, shown as a 1 pass cross flow module which can be attached together to form a 2 pass or 3 pass cross counter flow heat exchanger. The modular design can be used to vary the amount of heat recovery between the gas turbine and the process exhaust heat requirement for optimum performance. 2001-01-2544. Conceptional design modeling of gas turbine cycle for maximum work output, first law and second law effi- ciency. Y. M. Abdel-Rahim and H. A. Mohamed , Assiut Univ. The present paper discusses gas turbine operating ranges of val- ues of controlling cycle parameters for maximum first law effi- ciency īļi second law efficiency rļn and work output wnet. Three cycles have been studied: simple cycle, recuperative cycle and gen- eral open cycle. Correlation equations relating maximum values of iļi, Tļii, and Wnet to the controlling parameters (compressor and tur- bine efficiencies, maximum cycle temperature, isentropic tempera- ture ratio, fuel/air ratio, heat exchanger effectiveness and pressure drops in combustion chamber and heat exchanger) have been deter- mined and discussed. The present paper reveals that the cycle performance parameters rļi, Tļn, and Wnet drastically depend on cycle controlling parameters. There is no narrow region of values of controlling parameters that produce concurrent optimum values of īļi, īļn, and wnet- The maxi- mum cycle temperature for the three cycles considered has a linear effect on rļi while other controlling parameters have nonlinear effects on rļi, rļn, and wnet. For the general open cycle, the pressure drops APcc and APex have equal decreasing effects on Tļi, īļn, and Wnet, while both fuel-air ratio f and heat exchanger effectiveness r|x have equal increasing effect on these performance parameters. The present correlation equations, augmented with other experimental and detailed design studies for each of the cycle units, could provide a good basis for the realistic design process of actual turbines. 2001-01-2545. (SP- 1635) Application of direct oxidation of liquid hydrocarbon fuels in solid oxide fuel cells to automotive auxiliary power units. Gary M. Crosbie, Erica Perry Murray , and David R. Bauer , Ford Motor Co.; and Hyuk Kim, Seungdoo Park, John M. Vohs, and University of Pennsylvania Raymond J. Gorte, University of Pennsylvania. To meet the increasing electrical power demands for advanced internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, auxiliary power units (APUs) are of growing interest. Fuel cell-based APUs offer the potential for high chemical-to-electrical conversion efficiency with low noise and low emissions. It has recently been shown that solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) can be used to directly convert the chemi- cal energy of liquid hydrocarbon fuels to electricity. Because the combustion reaction takes place by direct oxidation of vaporized fuel at the fuel cell anode, the expectation exists for development of compact, reformerless APUs that can operate on the same fuel that the ICE uses for vehicle propulsion. Critical issues for the trans- portation SOFC-APU applications are fast start-up and the need to survive extensive thermal cycling. Since many present high- volume automotive applications of ceramics survive in harsh thermal cycling and vibration environments (as in spark plugs, catalysts and exhaust sensors), it is suggested by analogy that fast-heat-up, long- life, high-value automotive SOFCs can be designed and manufac- tured. This paper will review recent direct oxidation laboratory results and mechanical and thermal property data about the ceramic constituents of SOFCs to help to prioritize needed research and development. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2547. (SP-1635) A comparison of two fuel cell air compression systems at low load. Galen W. Kulp and Douglas J. Nelson, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are considered to be one of the best alternative power sources for automobiles. For this application, high power and high power density are required. Pressurizing the fuel cell system gives both higher efficiency and higher power density, but that pressure costs a percentage of the fuel cell output power. The compressor used to elevate the pressure has a direct effect on the system efficiency and water balance character- istics, especially at low load. Compressors being developed for fuel cell applications are examined to determine their effect on a fuel cell system. Two compressor technologies are discussed; a positive dis- placement twin-screw compressor and a turbocompressor, and their effects at low loads and set minimum compressor flows are exam- ined. The turbocompressor proves to be a superior machine in terms of efficiency, and therefore offers the most promising effect on sys- tem efficiency of the two compressors. The twin-screw compressor, on the other hand, offers more flexible pressure ratio and better water balance characteristics at low fuel cell loads, which is an important factor with PEM fuel cell systems. These results show the importance of determining the operating range of the system in the choice of a compressor for a fuel cell system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-2548. (SP-1635) Control system development for automotive PEM fuel cell vehicles. D. Craig Mays, Anthony B. Campbell, Wolfgang A. Fengler, and Stephen A. Rowe, Honeywell International. Honeywell Engines and Systems (E&amp;S) Environmental Control Systems (ECS) division has been developing a 50 kW proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell brassboard system for automo- tive application as part of a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pro- gram. A primary issue in the development of the brassboard is the automatic control of the system. A preferred DOE requirement is dynamic load following from idle to peak power. Since the PEM 325</page><page sequence="325">2001-01-2548-2001-01-2566 stacks require precise inlet condition control for both the air and fuel to achieve high efficiency, the control system must provide good dynamic tracking and low steady-state error over the entire operat- ing range. In addition, the controller must provide automatic system start-up and shutdown, built-in-test (BIT) to monitor key system parameters, and take corrective action if those parameters reach an unsafe condition. The purpose of this paper is to present the control system design approach taken by the authors to achieve those goals. Topics covered will include dynamic system modeling and simula- tion, obtaining system dynamic response data via test, control design approaches using the system model, and subsystem test data that provides initial validation of the approach. The paper will also dis- cuss relevant technical hurdles that remain for developing this sys- tem and its controller into a viable commercial product. 2001-01-2549. (SP- 1635) Fuel cell system experiences in auto- motive applications. Gary M. Sopko, XCELLSiS Corp. XCELLSiS Corporation is a Fuel Cell System Engineering and Integration company working in an Alliance with Ford Motor Com- pany, DaimlerChrysler, Ballard Power Systems, and ECOSTAR. The goal of the Alliance is to successfully commercialize Fuel Cell propulsion systems in the automaker partner's vehicles. XCELLSiS is the Tier 1 Fuel Cell System supplier and system integrator with the Fuel Cell stack being supplied by Ballard. The power developed by the XCELLSiS system is transferred to the ECOSTAR drive motor completing the vehicle propulsion system. Fuel cell-powered vehicles have been produced by both auto- maker partners, Ford and DaimlerChrysler, and introduced to the public in conjunction with the Fuel Cell Alliance and the California Fuel Cell Partnership. The vehicles are code named Ford Focus Fuel Cell Vehicle and the DC Necar 4 A. Through these vehicle experi- ences and developments, XCELLSiS and its partners have amassed knowledge of the operation of Fuel Cell Systems in fully functional, light-duty vehicle environments to further augment heavy duty applications. Information from these experiences of Fuel Cells pro- viding the primary source of propulsion in an automobile environ- ment will contribute to the Alliance product development processes. This paper will look through the XCELLSiS Fuel Cell System development experience as it applies to the most recent vehicles. It will also discuss peripherally the vehicle interaction along with Fuel Cell System effects, which arose during the development of the Fuel Cell System. The paper will illustrate that vehicle experiences are technically challenging and many, however, not insurmountable. It will also support the automotive industry's high confidence regarding the future of Fuel Cells as a viable power source for light- and heavy- duty vehicle propulsion 2001-01-2552. Controlling weight transfer with active damp- ing. Badih Jawad, Hassane El-Khoury, James Todd, and Mark Masen, Lawrence Technological Univ. This paper discusses the design and application of a semi-active damping system controlled by a student-designed microprocessor that reads accelerations laterally and longitudinally from separate accelerometers to anticipate chassis orientation and responds with an analog voltage to each damper. This dynamically alters the shock oils effective viscosity to keep the chassis movement within desired parameters. The system described will be incorporated into a one-seater open-wheeled racecar that is outfitted with a non-parallel, unequal length SLA suspension designed for entry in the 2001 Formula SAE competition. The focus will be more on the damping of low and high frequency obstacles and the resulting chassis (sprung mass) control rather than controller design, since it is an entirely different collec- tion of papers unto itself. 2001-01-2553. Intake system design for a Formula SAE application. Badih A. Jawad, Jeffrey P. Hoste, and Brian E. John- son, Lawrence Technological Univ. A prototype engine intake design incorporating a required 20- millimeter restrictor is currently being evaluated for the 2001 For- mula SAE competition. The engine is a 600 Honda CBR F4 four stroke. This carbureted stock engine was converted to fuel injection, requiring complete intake redesign. The primary difference from the stock intake design is the use of dual plenums, which prevents charging losses due to overlapping intake valve events. The throttle body and venturi design have also been improved. Preliminary test results are presented to validate design calculations and indicate potential for improvements. 2001-01-2554. Aerodynamic drag and fuel economy in a For- mula SAE racing style vehicle. Badih A. Jawad, Maria M. Long- necker, Kevin Nagy, and JoHanna S. Timmer, Lawrence Technolog- ical Univ. Aerodynamic drag directly impacts the fuel economy attainable by a vehicle. In the Formula SAE competition (FSAE), fuel econ- omy is a factor during the endurance phase. The focus of this paper is to study the effects of aerodynamic drag and how it impacts the fuel economy of a FSAE racing style vehicle. The Lawrence Tech- nological University (LTU) 1999 and 2000 cars will be used in this study to evaluate various methods to reduce drag and improve fuel economy. Empirical methods will be used and the study will be lim- ited to the effects of form and interference drag. 2001-01-2565. Automated drilling systems of ARIANE 5 structures. Joaquin Vargas, Pilar Moracho, and Francisco Javier Martínez Quintero, EADS CASA. Two Automated Drilling Systems used in the manufacturing pro- cess of ARIANE 5 structures are described. One of them is a NC system where a specially designed machine runs around the two assembly tools of the Equipment Bay. The other one is a tailor-made pneumatic system that also runs around the assembly tool of and Inter-Stage Structure. In both systems, conclusions about the use of those drilling units will be exposed. Finally, an automatic riveting unit will be intro- duced. This unit is nowadays in a development stage and will be integrated in both related systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2566. An investigation into the use of small, flexible, machine tools to support the lean manufacturing environment. Jason D. McGahey and Adam J. Schaut, Boeing Co.; and Edward Chalupa, Paul Thompson, and Gary Williams, Advanced Integra- tion Technology, Inc. Drilling fastener holes in large assemblies is traditionally accom- plished through the use of large machine tools in order to obtain the accuracies required for the assembled part. Given recent advances of machine design and machine controller compensation, the accu- racy of the motion platform can be corrected if the machine is repeatable. This coupled with the use of a vision system or touch probe to compensate for assembly variations, permit the use of smaller, more portable drilling systems. These smaller, more porta- ble machine tools allow for lean manufacturing techniques to be incorporated into build processes, utilize less floor space, and in many cases are less costly than larger, permanent machine tools. This paper examines the feasibility of utilizing a small 5-axis, portable, drilling system for drilling the side panel skins on the F/A-18 E/F forward fuselage. The system will have the capability to scan key-locating features on the assembly, correct for any assem- bly variations, and drill and countersink through various stack-ups of composite, aluminum, and titanium. The drilling system can be easily hoisted on and off of the existing assembly jig to allow for additional utilization of the assembly jig for other manufacturing operations. This paper will examine the technical aspects of the por- table machine tool, along with the advantages and disadvantages of small portable drilling machines for the use in assembly processes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 326</page><page sequence="326">200 1 -0 1 -2567-200 1 -0 1 -2575 2001-01-2567.

Automated cold working using split mandrel technology. George Bullen , Northrop Grumman Corp. In order to support the T-38 Wing Life Improvement program, the Materials and Process Product Support group was requested to perform a metallurgical examination of a test article containing sev- eral cold expanded holes drilled in an aluminum/aluminum and an aluminum/steel assembly. The assembly, complete with a wing skin which were composed of a trunnion or landing ear rib, and a tip rib, was designed to represent a miniature T-38 wing and was used to determine the feasibility of cold expanding or cold working of holes drilled in T-38 wings using automated machinery incorporating a split mandrel process per Process Specification FH-114. 2001-01-2569. Method of accurate countersinking and rivet shaving. Todd Rudberg and Scott Smith , Electroimpact , Inc.; and Andy Smith , Airbus UK, Ltd. Wing skin riveting and bolting requires the surface to be flush to +/- .025mm(.00r) to produce an acceptable finish. Using the method described in this paper, automated wing riveting technology and panel assembly techniques can achieve better shave height and countersink accuracies than have previously been possible in production. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2570.

It will as well describe the sophisticated technology used to ensure the impor- tant requirements including pictures and photographs showing the system in process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2571. Orbital drilling of sandwich constructions for space applications. Richard Lindqvist, Saab AB; and Ingvar Eriks- son and Mathias Wolf, Novator AB. This paper deals with orbital drilling of sandwich constructions for space applications. Sandwich constructions for space applica- tions are typically made up of thin layers of carbon fiber composite skins separated by an aluminum or carbon honeycomb core. Drilling holes in such structures is required for assembly purposes. A com- mon and significant problem occurs when drilling such structures with conventional methods, namely delamination on the exit side of the composite layers. In this study orbital drilling is investigated as a means of eliminating delaminations and other frequently encoun- tered problems with conventional drilling of laminated composite structures. Holes of different sizes were drilled in sandwich panels using orbital drilling. Both automatic (CNC) and semi-automatic (portable) orbital drilling were investigated. Damage in the vicinity of the holes was assessed by means of microscopic evaluation. It was concluded that orbital drilling effectively eliminated delamina- tions and other types of damage in the composite skins. In addition other significant advantages of orbital drilling are highlighted in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2572. Automated support of manual fastening oper- ations. Raymond P. LeCann, Multinational Products &amp; Services. A number of automated fastener installation machines have dem- onstrated the advantage of cassette feeder systems as well as the benefits that accrue from the machine manipulation of fasteners. Although a substantial number of these automated systems are now in operation and are providing substantial cost and quality ben- efits to their users, a far greater number of fasteners are still and will continue to be, installed manually for some time to come. Recognizing the great number of manual operations that exist in the industry, we have concentrated our efforts on the development of systems that work in connection with the manual operator by pro- viding him with the benefits of automatic fastener storage, selection, sealant application and semi automatic installation. The manual operator support systems range from stationary, multi-station systems all the way down to shoulder supported 'packs' which provide similar functions for individual fastener installation. The configuration and capabilities of the systems will be described. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2573. Single-pass drilling of composite/metallic stacks. Glenn G. Born, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. Drill geometry specifications, per industry standards, are insuffi- cient to control a single-pass drilling process. For close tolerance holes, those having a tolerance band of 0.003 inch, cutting tool geometry must have additional requirements defined to ensure con- sistency in manufacturing processes. This paper addresses key char- acteristics and inspection methods required to control cutting tool performance and to ensure repeatability in an aerospace manufactur- ing environment. The primary intent of this paper is to raise the awareness in industry that higher quality product is required by end users. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2574. Understanding exit burr in the drilling pro- cess. William Nichol, Boeing. One of the chief difficulties in producing close tolerance holes in aircraft aluminum alloys is the problem of exit burrs. This synop- sis provides an explanation of the reasons for this phenomenon, as it is observed. This writing is not the result of an empirical study. Instead, it is based upon close observation and experience. Addition- ally, there is no attempt to explain the complexities of metallurgy and its effects on the drilling process. The assumption is that aircraft aluminum has a malleable quality that is necessary in terms of its function. However, this same property leads to challenges under cer- tain circumstances during drilling. Exit burr occurs as a result of several factors; the following fac- tors are the most significant: 1. Material properties; 2. Cutter point geometry; 3. Coolant/lubricant supply; 4. Chip removal efficiency; and 5. Mechanical stability of the set-up. Note: These same factors can be assumed to be significant con- siderations in overall hole qualities not exclusive to control of exit burns. 2001-01-2575. New fasteners used on the composite keel beam for the A340-500/600 program. Philippe Leseur, EADS Air- bus E ranee; and Massimo Cella and Arnaud Brunet, Huck Fasten- ers. For the Airbus A340-500/600 a composite keel beam of large dimensions has been designed and manufactured. The assembly techniques have been improved using large diameter lockbolts for composite applications that were specifically designed for the pur- pose. Lockbolt installation is simplified by the absence of friction and torque typical of threaded fasteners. The keel beam develop- ment evidenced the tendency toward thicker composite panels and even larger diameter lockbolts for the next A3 80. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 327</page><page sequence="327">2001-01-2576-2001-01-2599 2001-01-2576. Drill and drive end effector. Ben Hempstead and Russ DeVlieg, Electroimpact , Inc.; and Rajesh Mistry and Miles Sheridan , Airbus UK „ Ltd. Electroimpact developed an end effector for Airbus UK, Ltd., for use on a Kuka KR350 robot provided by Airbus UK. The end effec- tor is referred to as the DDEE (Drill and Drive End Effector), and incorporates four main functions. The end effector pushes up on a wing panel with programmable pressure, drills a hole with a servo- servo drill, inspects the hole with a servo ball-type hole gauge and then drives a pin-tail style lockbolt into the hole. The end effector is being used as part of a development and feasibility study for incorporating automation into the wing panel manufacture process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2578. The StressWave™ fatigue life enhancement process. Eric T. Easterbrook, StressWave, Inc.; Brian D. Flinn and Chris A. Meyer, University of Washington ; and Nils Juhlin, Nova- Comp Engineering, Inc. A new, patented process for improving the fatigue lives of holes in metal structures has been developed. The process, known as StressWave™, produces residual compressive stresses and fatigue performance comparable to, or better than, those produced by legacy cold working methods and is designed primarily for automated man- ufacturing, fastening and assembly environments. Eliminating the need for close-tolerance starting holes, consumable sleeves, liquid lubricant cleanup and off-line processing increases speed of opera- tion. These process benefits and associated cost savings satisfy many aspects of lean and continuous improvement program initiatives. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2579. Flexible automated riveting of fuselage skin panels. Philip Webb, Alex Chitiu, Carole Fayad, and Nabil Gindy, University of Nottingham; and Colm McKeown, Bombardier Aero- space Short Brothers PLC. This paper describes the development of highly flexible auto- riveting system based around multiple Tricept robots and compact and innovative end-effectors. The end-effectors are capable of per- forming drilling, countersinking, sealing and riveting operations. The key to the success of the system is the high repeatability and stiffness of the Tricept robot allied with a very compact end- effector. The compact end-effector allows riveting to be performed in confined areas thus increasing the number of rivets that can be inserted automatically. The end-effectors also contain a significant amount of process monitoring sensors to enable automated in- process checks and quality measurement. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2594. Post-machining distortion of formed fuselage frame segments. Gary R. Weber and Michael S. Hurd, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Process development work was conducted to develop a machined fuselage frame concept for a small (5 abreast) commercial airplane. To minimize detail fabrication cost and to facilitate lean manufac- turing, roll forming was identified as the preferred forming process. To reduce assembly costs, long frame segments were desired to min- imize the number of frame splices. Since plate stock is limited to lengths of approximately 3.66 meters (12 feet), formed aluminum extrusions were selected as the raw material form. Roll forming and stretch forming process paths were screened for both J section and rectangular bar extrusions. The post machining distortion produced in formed extrusion and plate hog-out frame segments was compared to each other and to process standards gov- erning allowable fit-up forces. As a result of this process develop- ment activity, a producible roll forming process path was developed. The direction as well as the magnitude of the distortion for the selected and alternate forming process paths will be discussed in detail. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2596. Process controlled manufacturing at Pratt &amp; Whitney. Christian Jesse, Pratt &amp; Whitney. The quality of parts and products is of increasing importance not just to customers but also reflects back to the business performance of the manufacturer. Consequently, great benefits are to be gained by learning and understanding the manufacturing processes used to produce parts. For this purpose on-machine probing is widely used in the aerospace and automotive industry. Closed Loop Manufacturing techniques include machine tool self-checks, automated setups, tool measurement, in-process prob- ing with process adjustment, on-machine final inspection, data col- lection and data analysis. All of these elements and more are utilized to collect data in a mostly automated fashion to subsequently correct and adjust undesired conditions that can affect part quality. Manu- facturing process data can be used to detect problems prior to machining a part and it also becomes the basis for influencing prod- uct design regarding manufacturability and for preventive machine tool maintenance. 2001 SAE Transections Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2597. Using XML to increase the value of as- produced workpiece measurement data. Charles B. Malloch, Pratt &amp; Whitney. Precision manufacturing often includes processes that require process-associated measurements and feedback loops to increase precision and meet specifications. We must make the measurements to get the benefits. We can often reap additional benefits for free from the measurements we already have, and frequently reap still more benefits by taking a small number of additional measurements with the equipment we've already had to pay for. If we have some excess capacity on a machine, we might be able to spare the machine time to make interim or final inspections, avoiding the costs of part movement, additional fixtures, personnel, and table time on coordinate measuring machines. The value of measurement data is vastly increased when the data is properly structured, associated, and stored. Self-describing data sets have long been a possibility, but never before have there been standards and cooperative efforts which permit the easy use and reuse of the data and provide open-source, open-architecture tools to do a great deal of the necessary work. The extensible Markup Language, or XML, is an emerging stan- dard language used for storing data along with its associated struc- tures and identifiers, and is thus a key enabler to the easy use, reuse, and sharing of manufacturing data between processes and partners. 2001-01-2598. Standard work - Lean tools and techniques. Brent A. Williams, Genie Industries. There are three key elements that must be in place before we can apply Standard Work. These elements are Takt Time, Standard Work Sequence, and Standard Work in Process. Once these ele- ments are in place, the Kaizen cycle may be applied to your process. Several forms are used to help us identify and understand our Kaizen opportunities. They are the Time Observation Sheet, Stan- dard Work Sheet, Percent Load Chart, and Standard Work Combi- nation Sheet. Proper utilization of these forms will show people and part flow, standard work in process, takt time, line balance, and equipment utilization. Reviewing these forms, clearly posted in the work areas, will help identify where to focus Kaizen activities and expected results. Standard Work must be constantly monitored and revised as nec- essary to be a valuable tool, and it is vital to have the shop floor team members involved in the development of Standard Work from the beginning. There is a huge difference between the team members following standards that are 'handed over,' and team members prac- ticing the process they own. 2001-01-2599. Application of Lean tools in a machine shop environment. Tom Stephenson, Royell Manufacturing. 328</page><page sequence="328">2001-01-2599-2001-01-2610 The machine shops that comprise the varied tiers of the aero- space manufacturing supply chain range from large corporations with hundreds of employees and multiple sites to small mom-and- pop shops with a handful of machines. Regardless of the size or complexity of the organization, they are all potential victims of dis- organization and waste. Orders get lost, parts are run in huge lots to achieve a perceived economic break-even with long set-up pro- cesses, and extra material is consumed while the same mistakes are made each time a part is set up for production runs. Most organiza- tions never escape the effects of this kind of waste because the fixes may be too simple to see and accept, and somewhat counter-intuitive. 2001-01-2600. Analyzing inventory/transportation cost tradeoffs for milkrun parts delivery systems to large JIT assem- bly plants. Keng Hoo Chuah and Jon C. Yingling, University of Kentucky . As one considers the interrelationship between supplier logistics and performance of JIT assembly plants, the question arises con- cerning how many hours of parts inventory are appropriate. Low inventories reduce holding costs, throughput times, and (by elimi- nating storage) material handling costs internal to the plant. More- over, under the lean philosophy, low inventories enable improved control over part quality and supplier performance and they main- tain a healthy stress on the system necessary to motivate improve- ments. The dollar magnitude of these later savings is intangible but generally considered significant. On the other hand, low inventories also increase the frequency of milkrun routes and the number of sup- pliers on these routes, hence, increasing transportation costs. Using an optimization model for milkrun route design that may be para- meterized by inventory level, empirical studies suggest that, in gen- eral, transportation costs at first increase only gradually as inventory levels are reduced and then begin to rise exponentially as a lower bound is approached. Based on this characteristic of the inventory/ transportation cost relationship, a procedure is established for esti- mating the number of hours of inventory for a given plant that appropriately reconciles the tradeoff between transportation and internal costs associated with inventory level. 2001-01-2601. Advanced composite manufacturing methods. Robert Biggs, Greg Schieleit , and Michael McBain, Lockheed Mar- tin Space Systems. To remain competitive in the advanced composites market, high- quality, cost-effective parts must be manufactured. Due to the nature that the fiber in an aerospace composite laminate must be collated to be efficient, a cost-effective and high-quality manufacturing pro- cess has been slow to develop. There have been advancements in manufacturing processes in recent years. In this paper, the develop- ment and application of manufacturing methods for advanced com- posites is described. State-of-the-art manufacturing methods such as advanced fiber placement, tape laying, resin infusion methods (resin transfer molding, vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding, resin film infusion), filament winding, hand lay-up, and hybrid methods are discussed. Various processes are discussed in terms of materials lamination, consolidation, and curing. Existing and emerging tech- nologies will be examined for potential applications. Advantages and disadvantages are listed. Issues such as cost, equipment, materi- als, tooling, part geometry, and maturity will also be discussed. 2001-01-2605. The effect of process damping on stability and hole form in drilling. Brian T. Whitehead and Philip V. Bayly, Washington Univ.; and Sean G. Calvert, Blue Road Research. A dynamic model of drilling is used to study the effects of pro- cess damping on tool stability and hole form. The formulation leads to an eigenvalue problem yielding cutting speed and depth of cut combinations that produce borderline stable solutions to the equa- tions of motion. The addition of process damping is seen to lead to the instability of low-frequency modes that resemble those found in practice. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2606. Frequency response measurement of cutting tools for aerospace applications. S. Smith, University of North Carolina at Charlotte ; and M. A. Davies, National Institute of Stan- dards and Technology. In order to increase the metal removal rates and productivity of cutting tools in aerospace applications, it is important to understand the dynamic characteristics of the machine-tool-workpiece combi- nation, typically expressed as a Frequency Response Function (FRF). It is exactly the lack of this understanding that leads to prob- lems with chatter, for example. Many users of machine tools find the measurement procedures and the computations difficult, and they do not perform them. While considerable progress has been made in easing the computational burden only recently has the mea- surement become easier. This paper describes 2 new techniques which reduce the skill level required to make the measurement. 2001-01-2607. Machined component quality improvements through manufacturing process simulation. D. M. Bowden, B. J. Sova, A. L. Beisiegel, and J. E. Halley, Boeing Co. New manufacturing technologies such as high-speed machining (HSM) are being developed to produce high-quality aerospace com- ponents. While our developing understanding of machining dynam- ics is enabling precise control of cutting tools to provide for high dimensional accuracy, residual stresses present in aluminum mill products can compromise the ability to machine dimensionally accurate components from these stock materials. The advantages of precise tool control can be lost if the metal being cut moves during machining. And, even a perfectly machined part that distorts when it is released from the machine bed will cause problems upon assem- bly. Thus, ensuring the quality of the mill product becomes an enabling technology for advanced manufacturing approaches such as HSM. In this paper, we will examine how material quality can influence finished component quality, and discuss some of the ana- lytical methods we are utilizing to provide improved mill products for high precision manufacturing. 2001-01-2608.

Non-contact forming by application of a thermal source has been known for some time. Recently, it has been shown that much greater controllability can be introduced by replacing the thermal source with a laser. This yields a process with strong potential for applica- tion in aerospace, including the rapid manufacture of prototypes and the adjustment of misaligned components. This paper briefly reviews the mechanisms involved in laser forming and then summarizes experimental work carried out on alu- minum alloys and titanium alloys that led to the development of a prototype system for the forming of 2-D sheet materials. Emphasis 329</page><page sequence="329">2001-01-2610-2001-01-2635 is placed on the process advantages, including the high accuracy (arising from the progressive nature of the process) that can be achieved in forming or adjustment of misalignment.

Virtual extended enterprises, trusted agents, unions, temp agencies, info-expeditors, and the 'bonkers' busi- ness environment. Robert S. Ellinger, Logicon. The explosive acceleration in the pace of knowledge creation has fundamentally changed the business environment. This change has been termed die 'bonkers' business environment. This new business environment is exceptionally hostile to vertically integrated enter- prises, but very conducive to a new type of organization call the Vir- tually Extended Enterprise (VEE). This ephemeral organizational structure is made up of many, perhaps hundreds, of individual orga- nizations. It requires a cast of new role types for the organizations within it and supporting its lifecycle. This cast includes entrepre- neurs, trusted agents, assemblers, info-expeditors, and arbitrators. The changed business environment and the rise of the VEE will pro- vide new sets of opportunities and challenges for main-street, Wall Street, and the Aerospace Industry. It is and will be 'an interesting time' -to quote an ancient Chinese curse. 2001-01-2624. Process simulation of superplastic forming of titanium structure. Barry Pridham, Brian Ginty, and Adam Marri- ott, BAE SYSTEMS. Superplastic Forming and Diffusion Bonding (SPF/DB) of tita- nium structures enables the manufacture of highly efficient unitized structures. Single piece components can be formed which conven- tionally would have to be fabricated from a large number of compo- nents. Successful forming depends upon good design, process control, and understanding of the forming process. In particular it is neces- sary to form at an appropriate strain rate. This is controlled by a Pressure Time Cycle which for simple low strain components can be derived by iteration. Process Simulation by Finite Element analy- sis is required for more complex components. The development of the process simulation tool SNAP (Super- plastic Numerical Analysis Package) is discussed along with mate- rial forming characteristics and applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2626. Comparison of various braiding technologies for composite materials in aerospace applications. Jürgen Brandt, Klaus Drechsler, and Andreas Gessler, EADS Deutschland GmbH. Composite materials offer a high potential for realizing high- performance lightweight structures for aerospace applications. The recent developments are focussed on the further improvements of mechanical performance, especially regarding damage tolerance, and above all on affordabilty. A high potential to reach this goals is offered by textile structural composites. Textile fiber performs for composite reinforcement can be manufactured automatically with an optimized fiber architecture in 3D space. The results are reduced manufacturing time and a 3D fiber rein-forcement to prevent delaminations during impact loads. Of special interest for complex structural components are braid- ing technologies allowing the automated production of near net shaped fiber preforms. Two different technologies will be described and discussed in the paper: The robot-assisted round braiding and the 3D braiding. Both technologies have been developed by the EADS research center together with several partners in the frame- work of internal and public-funded projects. First prototypes are now available in the EADS textile lab at Ottobrunn (Munich, Ger- many) and can be used for basic investigations and first application studies. While the round braiding allows the production of complex hol- low preforms (curved or non-curved) the 3D braiding has a high potential for realizing integral profile shaped structures with opti- mized fiber architecture. In the paper the overall performance of textile structural compos- ites based on braiding will be evaluated and first exemplary applica- tions, especially in the aerospace field will be presented (stiffened profiles, engine components). Finally, the recent developments also in combination with other textile technologies like stitching will be discussed. 2001-01-2627. Paint stripping and activating of aircraft com- posite structures; tested and approved according to SAE MA4872. Olav G. Schulz, SLCLR Lasertechnik GmbH; and Chris- toph W. Matz, Lufthansa Technik AG. Before new technologies can be applied within the aviation industry, they have to be carefully tested according to international standards and approved by the OEM's. To implement the new alter- native SLCR-Laser coating removal process into the A/C mainte- nance centers, it was tested in a comprehensive testing program based on the SAE MA4872 guidelines and additional requirements given by Airbus and Boeing. This program was performed by Luf- thansa Technik AG, Hamburg and SLCR Lasertechnik GmbH, Düren in close collaboration with EADS Airbus and the Boeing Corp. The paper depicts the results gained during the tests conducted according to the SAE document and it presents some layouts of respective systems. 2001-01-2628. Fatigue damage prediction for bonded com- posite repairs applied to metallic aircraft structures. R. J. Clark and D. P. Romilly, University of British Columbia. This paper describes the initial development of methods for pre- dicting the fatigue life of bonded composite repairs applied to cracked aluminum aircraft structures. Bonded repairs offer great potential in stopping or slowing crack growth. The benefits of bonded repairs when compared to riveted repairs are significant, and include improvements in fatigue life, inspectability, and cost. The main barrier to the widespread use of this technology is the lack of methods for ensuring damage tolerance and durability. In this paper, approximate analytical equations are developed to characterize both disbonding and crack growth in a repair applied to a center-cracked plate. The equations are in a form suitable for use in probabilistic risk assessments and inclusion in industry codes and standards, and have been validated against a boundary element model. Comparisons of fatigue life predictions with results from published experiments illustrate the importance of cracked plate geometry and bending on the rate of cracking and disbonding. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2630. Power lean: A practical approach to opera- tions excellence. Ron Leblanc, Rockwell Automation. In today's global markets, competitive strategies resembling warfare tactics are transforming the way organizations create value for customers. Competitiveness depends heavily on product leader- ship; however, the creation and delivery of this valued product requires superior processes and systems. Ultimately, the objective is maximum value from the customer's perspective, while consum- ing the fewest resources. 2001-01-2635. Aviation safety training - A failure in motion. John C. Johnson, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ. What was always referred to as pilot error or human error is now considered to be an error by the organization that trained (or failed to train) the operator or front-line person. Although mistakes due to human error will never be completely eradicated, every attempt must be made to reduce these errors to their lowest possible number. Unfortunately, changing human behavior is difficult at best. The typical aviation safety training program does not use all available 330</page><page sequence="330">2001-01-2635-2001-01-2644 strategies to make these needed changes in behavior. Even one small omission can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of a training pro- gram. Instead of cranking out hour after hour of traditional lecture- type training, changes must be made in methodology and tech- niques. The training wheel is continually cranked, but whether it does any good is usually 'hoped for' and guessed at. Aviation safety training is, for so much time and effort, a failure in motion. 2001-01-2636. Applicability of system safety processes and operational risk management training for future pilots. Randolph S. Reynolds , Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ. System safety is taught as a discipline in some aeronautical pro- grams. Such a course maybe designed to prepare career-minded avi- ation students with a solid background to face the technical intrica- cies of the commercial flight arena. Over the course of the past decade, the complexity of large modern transport category aircraft has grown, and along with that growth the command and control functions built into the avionics and flight control systems have become automatic. Most new pilots entering into the cockpits of these aircraft require an understanding of how to manage these new systems in light of the basic design principles used. One excellent method of providing education for students in aeronautical studies is through courses in system safety and operational risk management (ORM). The advantage of doing this is to provide an aircrew mem- ber sufficient understanding of the logic processes and analysis inherent in system safety to permit him to quickly learn how to han- dle issues and emergencies that arise in the actual operation of the aircraft. This paper brings to the forefront one methodology in which system safety training is fundamentally helpful for aircrew piloting complex systems. 2001-01-2637. Communication - Hijacking - Occupational safety what is the connection? Terrence Stobbe, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ.; and William Cormier, Energy Flux Inc. People at work are frequently distracted ('hijacked') by a mix of in and out of workplace events, frequently including poor communi- cations. As a result, they sometimes find themselves in situations in which they can be seriously injured or killed. An investigation into the 'how' these situations were initiated led to list of six primary causes. Based on the list, an experiential program was developed to help people remain focused on their work, not get hijacked, and improve their communications. 2001-01-2638. Risk reduction strategies for collegiate avia- tion (the FAA and you - Managing the legal risk in aviation). John J. Ripley, Auburn Univ. There is nothing more frustrating and frightening to most pilots and flight instructors than to be the target of an FAA enforcement action. An enforcement action can result in anything from a warning letter to loss of flight privileges. The pilot who is subject to an FAA enforcement action must be aware of the various sanctions and enforcement procedures the FAA has at its disposal to prosecute and punish him. More importantly, the pilot must be made aware of his rights and privileges during an enforcement action. 2001-01-2639. Aircraft safety monitoring and assessment practices. Hanna Czarnecki and Zdzisław Klim, Bombardier Aero- space. Aircraft systems are designed with reliability, safety and cost effectiveness in mind. The certification of the aircraft is based on tests and results of theoretical analyses that show the compliance with the FAR/JAR requirements. Monitoring for safety for in-service aircraft is an important, criti- cal and extremely complex process. The ultimate objective is to assure that the safety level is equal to the original estimate or better. The manufacturer of the aircraft is particularly responsible for over- all monitoring and assessment of all safety-related events and cor- rective actions. Many different philosophies were adopted for this purpose. The safety monitoring and audit strategy is generally based on experi- ence, engineering judgment, event analysis and numerical quantifi- cation by using probability theory and statistical tools. The aircraft sequential entry in the service and the aging of their components lead to the non-homogeneity of the fleet. Safety assessment based on the qualitative methods becomes difficult. Utilization of the quantitative methods could lead to wrong conclusions, such as the dilution effect where magnitude is related to the fleet age, which could be very detrimental in a safety assessment. Specific failure modes associated with a relatively small portion of the fleet could be easily overlooked when the analysis is based on the standard sta- tistical tools that are commonly used by the industry. Our ignorance could be the root cause of hazardous events lead- ing to the decline of overall safety. 2001-01-2640. Analysis of flight operational quality assur- ance data using model-based activity tracking. Todd J. Callan- tine, San Jose State University/NASA Ames Research Center. Future technologies will enable carriers to collect additional flight data for Flight Operational Quality Assurance. This paper describes how analysis of these data using model-based activity tracking can automatically assess the causes of detected deviations to support safety-enhancement efforts. The paper describes the activity tracking methodology implemented in the Crew Activity Tracking System (CATS) using an example drawn from previous research in which CATS analyzed full-mission simulation data online. The paper also discusses current research on using CATS to analyze flight data from a Boeing 757 aircraft. 2001-01-2641. The coupling of operational safety and INFO- SEC assessments. Marshall D. Abrams and Mark Joseph, MITRE Corp. This paper describes an approach to integrating security and safety analysis of an Air Traffic Service (ATS) using the security assessment as an additional input to the risk management process. This approach helps address potential problems in coordinating safety and security requirements such as: different system models used for safety and security; different documentation structures for the analyses and their results; and the practice of isolating safety and security requirements processes. What motivates this approach is the overlap between security and safety considerations in the identi- fication of hazards and associated risk management strategies. 2001-01-2644. Finding the 'smoking gun': The role of expert analysis in aircraft accident investigations. Thomas A. Farrier, Air Transport Association of America. There are a finite number of conditions that can result in the loss of an aircraft. While it may be daunting to consider the entire range of possible scenarios, virtually every hull loss accident is ultimately traceable to one of two basic conditions: a fly able aircraft that for some reason concluded its flight abnormally, or an unflyable air- craft. Thus, every aircraft accident investigator arrives at the scene of a crash with a clear starting point, and equally clear objectives. Early aircraft accident investigations rarely had much in the way of empirical evidence to go on beyond the scene of the crash. This inevitably shaped the art and science of conducting such investiga- tions toward heavy concentration on wreckage and the immediate vicinity where it came to rest. As a result, there are a variety of clas- sic approaches to accident site analysis, but all are aimed at isolating the physical evidence necessary to prove or reject specific sequences of events leading up to the accident. Of course, the development of other sources of pre-accident information and the growing need for laboratory analysis of wreckage has led to an average reduction in the percentage of time spent at the actual scene of the accident for a given investigation. Still, the need to identify and evaluate physi- cal evidence - especially the right evidence - is as urgent as ever, even as the need to assess other, less tangible evidence has grown. 331</page><page sequence="331">200 1 -0 1 -2644-200 1 -0 1 -2652 The complexity of modern aircraft design has made the field investigator's task much more difficult. 'Kicking tin' has given way to tripping over a host of exotic fabrication materials, many of which fail under crash forces in ways that resist on-the-spot interpretation. Establishing the continuity of flight controls has become less a mat- ter of mechanics and plumbing, and far more a matter of electrons and software. In short, physical evidence is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain, its significance sometimes may not always be apparent, and in some cases it may not exist at all. The difficulties associated with the investigation task are far from insurmountable. Rather, they point to the need for a continua- tion, acceleration, and institutionalization of the trend toward seek- ing expert assistance at every stage of an aircraft accident investiga- tion. The evolution of aviation technology already has made lead investigators increasingly dependent upon the skills of specialists in formulating both valid conclusions regarding accidents and appro- priate actions to prevent their recurrence. This suggests that the tra- ditional view of air safety investigators - as generalists capable of assessing most accident scenes and evidence without regard for the specific types of aircraft involved - may need to give way to a 'gen- eral contractor' paradigm, where investigators obtain supplementary technical expertise on a routine basis. This paper is an examination of the relationship between aircraft accident investigators and the technical experts upon whom they must increasingly rely. Its ultimate objectives are to raise awareness among investigators regarding resources that should be brought to bear in future accident inquiries, and to provide a framework within which engineering and scientific professionals may explore means of greater engagement in both the investigation and the prevention of aircraft losses. 2001-01-2646. Describing and probing complex system behavior: A graphical approach. Edward Bachelder and Nancy Leveson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Hands-on training and operation is generally considered the pri- mary means that a user of a complex system will use to build a men- tal model of how that system works. However, accidents abound where a major contributing factor was user disorientation/ misorientation with respect to the automation behavior, even when the operator was a seasoned user. This paper presents a compact graphical method that can be used to describe system operation, where the system may be composed of interacting automation and/or human entities. The fundamental goal of the model is to cap- ture and present critical interactive aspects of a complex system in an integrated, intuitive fashion. This graphical approach is applied to an actual military helicopter system, using the onboard hydraulic leak detection/isolation system as a testbed. The helicopter Flight Manual is used to construct the system model, whose components include: logical structure (waiting and checking states, transitional events and conditions), human/automation cross communication (messages, information sources), and automation action and associ- ated action limits. Using this model, examples of the following types of mode confusion are identified in the military helicopter case study: 1) Unintended side effects, 2) Indirect mode transitions, 3) Inconsistent behavior, 4) Ambiguous interfaces, and 5) Lack of appropriate feedback. The model also facilitates analysis and revi- sion of emergency procedures, which is demonstrated using an actual set of procedures. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2648. Evaluation and application of MIDAS v2.0. Sandra G. Hart , NAS A- Ame s Research Center ; David Dahn , Micro Analysis &amp; Design Inc.; Adolph Atencio, US Army Aeroflight Dynamics Directorate ( Ret )/N AS A- Ame s Research Center; and K. Michael Dalai, Raytheon STX Corp. Version 2.0 of the Man-Machine Design and Analysis System (MIDAS) was released in 2001. It provides tools to describe an operating environment, mission, and equipment. User-defined goals, procedures, and knowledge interact with and are modified by models of perception, memory, situation awareness, and attention and constrained by the environment. Output of simulations that demonstrate or evaluate new capabilities or answer questions posed by customers are presented graphically and visually. MIDAS has been used to model different professions (soldiers in protective gear, air traffic controllers, astronauts, nuclear power plant operators, pilots), missions (e.g., flying, target designation, underwater explo- ration, police dispatch) and environments (e.g., battlefields, civil air- space, ocean floor, control rooms, low earth orbit). A recent inde- pendent evaluation of MIDAS V2.0 is reviewed. 2001-01-2649. Analyzing RVSM requirements in MNPS air- space and the effects on aircraft operations. Harry H. Ayuhi, Boe- ing Commercial Airplane Group. In order to safely and efficiently control extremely high air traffic congestion in special navigation areas, reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM) requirements were established for aircraft opera- tors using Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS) airspace. Resultant benefits in operating efficiency came with increased costs to aircraft operators in complying with RVSM required navigation equipment, maintenance, training, and opera- tional procedures. Commercial air carriers - the predominant users of this airspace - were the prime beneficiaries, while business air- craft operators experienced a non-equitable cost burden. Alternate cost-sharing methods are presented in an effort to combat the effect of impeded growth in the business aircraft industry. 2001-01-2650. Secure large-scale airport simulations using distributed computational resources. William J. McDermott, David A. Maluf, and Yuri Gawdiak, NASA Ames Research Center ; and Peter Tran, QSS Group, Inc. To fully conduct research that will support the far-term concepts, technologies and methods required to improve the safety of Air Transportation, a simulation environment of the requisite degree of fidelity must first be in place. The Virtual National Airspace Simu- lation (VNAS) will provide the underlying infrastructure necessary for such a simulation system. Aerospace-specific knowledge man- agement services such as intelligent data-integration middleware will support the management of information associated with this complex and critically important operational environment. This sim- ulation environment, in conjunction with a distributed network of super-computers, and high-speed network connections to aircraft, and to Federal Aviation Administration (FA A), airline and other data-sources will provide the capability to continuously monitor and measure operational performance against expected performance. The VNAS will also provide the tools to use this performance base- line to obtain a perspective of what is happening today and of the potential impact of proposed changes before they are introduced into the system. 2001-01-2651. Airport remote tower sensor systems. Richard Papasin, Yuri Gawdiak, David A. Maluf, and Christopher Leidich, NASA Ames Research Center; and Peter B. Tran, QSS Group, Inc. Remote Tower Sensor Systems are proof-of-concept prototypes being developed by NASA/Ames Research Center (NASA/ARC) with collaboration with the FAA and NOAA. RTSS began with the deployment of an Airport Approach Zone Camera System that includes real-time weather observations at San Francisco Interna- tional Airport. The goal of this research is to develop, deploy, and demonstrate remotely operated cameras and sensors at several major airport hubs and untowered airports. RTSS can provide real-time weather observations of airport approach zone. RTSS will integrate and test airport sensor packages that will allow remote access to real-time airport conditions and aircraft status. 2001-01-2652. Human factors in head-up synthetic vision dis- plays. Michael P. Snow and Guy A. French, Air Force Research Laboratory. 332</page><page sequence="332">200 1 -0 1 -265 2-200 1 -0 1 -265 8 Enabling technologies needed to provide pilots a synthetic view of the outside world are expected to mature within the next three to five years. Such a synthetic view, a display based at least partially on a database, is expected to greatly increase aircrew situation awareness in reduced visibility conditions with a consequent improvement in air safety. In particular, it is hoped that providing a synthetic view of the commanded flight path and the terrain sur- rounding the flight path will greatly reduce the incidence of con- trolled flight into terrain accidents. If a synthetic view can be pro- vided to the pilot as part of his/her head-up primary flight display, the potential exists to provide these benefits while allowing the pilot's head, eyes, and attention to remain focused outside the cock- pit. This paper reviews the current status of enabling technologies for head-up synthetic vision displays and outlines ongoing efforts in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to develop and test these displays, both in ground-based simulation and in flight. Human fac- tors issues associated with the design of these displays are discussed in detail. Among these issues are pilot information requirements, depth and self-motion cues provided, visual clutter in the head-up display (HUD), format of the synthetic view underlying other HUD symbology, integration with head-down displays, integration of the synthetic view with sensor information, and attentional issues. Examples of how these issues are considered in the design of a syn- thetic vision HUD are given, and recommendations made for the design of these displays based on this discussion and findings from human factors studies conducted by AFRL. 2001-01-2654. Synthetic vision databases for runway incur- sion avoidance. Dejan M. Damjanovic and Rick Ellerbrock , Jep- pesen, Inc. For a number of years, we have encountered the problems with aircraft runway incursions, and ground vehicle runway incursions. Following the tragic accident at Tenerife on March 27th, 1977, involving a KLM 747 and Pam Am 747 airliners colliding in the fog, the industry has striven to improve the safety of ground operations or airport surface movements. A number of enabling technologies have been emerging that has made that possible. These include the following: 1. Geographical Information Systems, 2. Global Posi- tioning Satellites (known as GPS), 3. Advances in Symbol Genera- tion technology, and 4. Increases in computing power deliverable at the cockpit. This paper discusses those technologies through the history of the projects that have put them into action. Industry trends have integrated those individual projects into a broader navigation paradigm, known as 'Synthetic Vision.' This new idea seeks to broadly enhance the situational awareness of all phases of flight, including taxi, take-off, departure, enroute, arrival, approach, and finally landing, rollout, and taxi back to the gate. Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) offer the hope of providing a significant decrease, or the eventual elimination of most types of runway incursions, at all of those airports for which synthetic vision databases shall be constructed. This paper shall introduce the composition and design of these databases, for a general audience. Finally, this paper will explore the current industry &amp; regulatory developments, concluding with the emergence of commercial proj- ects that seek to bring Runway Incursion Avoidance technology into the realm of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. 2001-01-2655. Vision 1 synthetic vision system. Patrick Krohn and John Jorgensen , Universal Avionics Systems Corp. Soon, pilots will be able to look at the outside world through an artificial window called Vision 1, a new system developed by Uni- versal Avionics Systems Corporation. Vision 1 takes the situational awareness advances from TAWS (terrain awareness warning sys- tem) to a new level by generating real-time terrain depictions on the pilot's primary flight displays. These real-time perspective terrain images, with additional three-dimensional position, flight plan and trend vector depictions, improve situational awareness of proximate terrain toward the perennial goal to enhance safety and reduce CFTT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) accidents. Advances in computer processor, graphics, displays and solid- state memory technologies coupled with availability of worldwide digital terrain databases have enabled situational awareness dis- plays. Early TAWS (terrain awareness warning system) utilized these technologies to produce situational awareness terrain depic- tions on weather radar displays. More recently, real-time perspec- tive, map and profile terrain depictions have been incorporated into TAWS to further enhance situational awareness. The next step is to take the latest technology advancements, which now provide the required performance, display quality and avionics robustness, to generate real-time terrain images on a pilot's primary flight dis- plays. Vision 1 is intended to break this new ground as a certified avionics system. This paper presents key Vision 1 enabling and development chal- lenges. These challenges include performance, robustness, reliabil- ity and integration with high-resolution primary flight displays, human factors and safety. 2001-01-2656. Ground-based inerting of a Boeing 737 center wing fuel tank. William M. Cavage, FAA. A series of aircraft flight and ground tests were performed by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Boeing Company to evalu- ate the effectiveness of ground-based inerting (GBI) as a means of reducing the flammability of center wing fuel tanks (CWTs) in the commercial transport fleet. Boeing made available a Boeing 737- 800 for modification and testing. The fuel tank was instrumented with gas sample tubing and thermocouples and tests were performed inerting the CWT to 8 percent oxygen to allow for a measurement of fuel tank inerting and heating. Results showed that under quies- cent conditions the oxygen concentration in the fuel tank remained somewhat constant, keeping the CWT inert (below 10- to 12-percent oxygen by volume) for relatively long periods of time. Certain wind conditions and flight conditions created cross venting within the CWT that allowed for significant increases in the oxygen. A modifi- cation to the vent system created a significant increase in the benefit of the GBI even at low to moderate fuel loads. 2001-01-2657. Detecting and extinguishing of arcs in aircraft electrical systems. Peter Meckler, E-T-A; Karl-Friedrich Eichhorn , University Leipzig; and Wilson Ho, E-T-A. Arcing conditions in aircraft electrical systems, in cable insula- tions that contain polyimid may cause explosive burning of the sheathed cable and surrounding materials due to the chemical struc- ture of this insulation material. Alternating current arcs exhibit a typical gap of the current flow. Test procedures have been estab- lished and they are the platform upon which existing and future developments and standards for arc fault detectors will be based. First generation devices detect arcs only upon their appearance because of their characteristic features whether in the time and/or frequency domain. The biggest challenge is to differentiate between 'normal' interference signals and arcs and to meet the desired criti- cal physical dimensions. An ideal solution would be to detect fail- ures of insulation defects prior to the appearance of an energetic arc and at the same time identifying the location of the fault. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2658. Recommendations for injury prevention in transport aviation accidents. Anita E. Grierson, Simula Technolo- gies, Inc.; and Lisa E. Jones, NASA Langley Research Center. In 1996, a national objective was established to reduce the rate of fatal accidents in aviation. To assist in determining the best meth- ods for improving aircraft crash survivability, a combined approach was used involving database research and the examination of case studies of transport aviation accidents. The results of the study include recommendations for maintaining occupiable space, 333</page><page sequence="333">2001-01-2658-2001-01-2668 enhancing occupant restraint, managing energy transferred to the occupant, improving egress, and increasing post-crash survival. 2001-01-2659. Importance of seat and head restraint posi- tions in reducing head-neck injuries. Bhavin V. Mehta, Prasad Petkar, and Robert Williams, Ohio Univ. Modeling of seat structures (often with foam cushions) is one of the challenges for current car crash and occupant safety analysis and modeling. The objective of the research was to analyze the effect of these parameters on linear and angular rearward motion of the head relative to the torso. This motion is responsible for the risk of the neck injury during a rear-end impact situation. Various seat models were developed in the LS-DYNA with the help of Solid Modeler 'SolidEdge' and finite element pre-processor, 'Hyper- Mesh.' Various parameters considered during the modeling were seat back angle, vertical position of head restraint with respect to the occupant's head, horizontal gap between back of occupant's head and head restraint, seat back joint stiffness, presence and absence of head restraint, presence and absence of seat belt. By varying the above factors, the seat models were developed. Numerous rear-end impact simulations were carried out with the seat models to analyze the effect on the dummy models. 2001-01-2660. Development of a dynamic aircraft seat analy- sis capability. Thomas M. Hermann, Michael W. Holmes, and Day- ton Hartley, Raytheon Aircraft Corp. The development of a dynamic aircraft seat analysis is presented in this paper. This analytical model is a nonlinear finite element model composed of a seat frame and cushion, restraint system, glare shield and a rigid body model of a 50th percentile Hybrid-II anthro- pomorphic test dummy ( ATD ) occupant. Results from this analyti- cal model are correlated with empirical results obtained during a full-scale dynamic test. The analysis is representative of the dynamic test. 2001-01-2662. Artificial intelligence, real-time, in-situ profil- ing system (AIRTIPS) a concept of real-time, routine in-flight monitoring and assessment of risk. Robert W. Sutton, Aviation Research, Inc. As more and more focus is placed on aviation safety worldwide, and particularly with the emphasis on 'data-driven' solutions, where the 'data' are accidents and/or accident rate, it is very easy to con- centrate on the negative result aspect of aviation operations, i.e., what went wrong. An investigation occurs, prevention/mitigation strategies are developed, the system is revised, and we again return to monitoring for negative events. The AIRTIPS concept represents a paradigm shift from 'investi- gate what went wrong,' to model and follow what's right. Using this philosophy, the paradigm is to monitor SUCCESSFUL profiles (where 'successful' means routine, safe operations), in real time, and notify the crew and/or AOC whenever the slightest difference occurs, i.e., the focus is now on copying routine, successful opera- tions, instead of investigating unsafe consequences of deviations. 2001-01-2663. Ultrasonic in-flight wing ice detection. Derrick D. Hongerholt and Gary Willms, Goodrich Corp.; and Joseph L. Rose, Pennsylvania State Univ. Discussions and sample results are presented for an in-flight wing ice accretion detector based on newly developed ultrasonic guided wave sensors and measurements. Detection over a fairly large area can be accomplished with these sensors. Physical princi- ples, hardware, and computational methods are outlined along with a description of two flight demonstration programs. Excellent results are obtained, pointing to the potential for immediate field use of this new ice detection technology. 2001-01-2664. Improving the effectiveness of airplane certifi- cation analysis processes. Frank C. Fickeisen, International Feder- ation of Airworthiness. This paper suggests a number of possibilities for improvement of quantitative safety analyses of airplane systems. These possibili- ties include: better balance between qualitative and quantitative pro- cesses, closer coordination of work by designers and analysts and use of in-service information to evaluate fault tree mid-level events. 2001-01-2665. Reducing human errors in aircraft mainte- nance. John W. Saull, International Federation of Airworthiness (IFA). Human Errors in aircraft maintenance are probably on the increase, but specific data is still sparse. Since the mid 1990 's, regu- latory authorities and the operating industry have been taking this matter very seriously and much has been done to try and improve the situation with training and improving Safety Management pro- cedures. This is against a background of increasing operating pres- sures, changing technology, shortage of certifying engineers and increased sub-contracting. Understanding the human error chain involves all disciplines in the aviation process, from design to ramp operations, including maintenance, repair and overhaul processes. Analysis of incidents/accidents strongly points to simple, often procedural, errors rather than those concerned with technology and they are often common mode. The aim of this paper is to explain the background and developments in the attempt to reduce mainte- nance human errors. 2001-01-2666. Enabling the certifying engineer - An account of a research project undertaken in 2000. Tony Hines, UK Avia- tion Training Association. In 1996/7, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) commis- sioned a review of airworthiness and quality assurance in the UK aircraft maintenance sector. The findings and recommendations were published as CAA Paper 9701 1. The review panel was chaired by Professor Roger Wootton, Dean of Engineering at the City Uni- versity, London. His report included a number of issues concerning the training of aircraft maintenance engineers, including Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (LAMEs). Whilst European Joint Aviation Requirements (JARs) specify the requirements for experience and knowledge and describe what must be included in 'basic' and 'aircraft type' training, there is no standard for the personal qualities that LAMEs should possess to make them effective in their role. A research project carried out by the UK Aviation Training Association in 2000 has established such a standard in the form of a 'competency framework.' This has been validated by LAMEs and industry professionals who have an interest in the competency of LAMEs. Development of the framework into a web-based personal feed- back system is currently being investigated. This paper describes the research project, the competency frame- work and its academic validity. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2667. A practical approach to human factors in maintenance - A board member's view. Bernard Newton, Britan- nia Airways Limited. As a Britannia Airways Board Member and more specifically as a Technical Director, I naturally approach maintenance matters and non-technical issues from a practical viewpoint. At a recent confer- ence, Gerry Allen said 'an ounce of effort is worth a ton of theory.' This presentation represents Britannia's ounce of effort. 2001-01-2668. Investigation of main rotor spindle assembly retaining rods from an Army utility helicopter. Marc S. Pepi, Scott M. Grendahl, and Victor K. Champagne, US Army Research Laboratory. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the root cause of the differences noted in the fatigue test data of main rotor spindle assembly retaining rods fabricated from three different vendors, as part of a 'second source' evaluation process.

Greeves, Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. This presentation will cover a number of hazards that affect pilots, during the approach, landing, take-off and taxi phases. It includes non-precision approaches, wind shear and turbulence, wildlife strikes and runway incursions. The presentation will give a brief overview of each area and suggest some present and future solutions, which would aid pilots to avoid or to mitigate these haz- ards. It also illustrates some of the hazard counter-measures intro- duced at the Hong Kong International Airport. 2001-01-2671. Is 'safe' safe enough? James Passmore, Pass- more Safety Management Ltd. This paper advances the proposition that although the outside world perceives aviation as 'safe' and accepting that the accident rate is slowly falling, there remain a number of accidents every year which appear to have common causes. Is aviation really a learning industry? Could significant progress be made by requiring airlines to demonstrate that lessons have been learnt and procedures changed accordingly? Where the cause is technical, change occurs through the manufacturer and the regulator. Where operating procedures and human factors are involved changes occur slowly, if at all. The author suggests three courses of action for improvement. 2001-01-2672. Optimal aircraft collision avoidance in termi- nal areas. Kouamana Bousson, University of Beira Interior. The present paper deals with optimal flight collision avoidance in terminal areas. The collision avoidance problem is expressed as an optimization problem whose solution vector is composed of indi- vidual aircraft headings, velocities and flight levels as guidance information that corresponding aircraft should follow to automati- cally avoid collision and at the same time to converge to a specified landing procedure start point. Simulation results are presented and show that the proposed method is capable of ensuring collision avoidance in an optimal way. 2001-01-2703. The design concept of the Duramax 6600 diesel engine. Jim Kerekes , General Motors Corp.; Shinichi Ohoka, Isuzu Motors America Inc.; and O samu Horada , Isuzu Motors. A new diesel engine, called the Duramax 6600 has been designed by Isuzu Motors (Isuzu) for an upcoming full-size General Motors Corporation (GM) pickup truck. It incorporates the latest diesel technology in order to improve on the inherent strengths of a diesel engine, such as fuel economy, torque and reliability, while also pro- ducing higher output, smoother driveability, and lower noise. The Duramax 6600 is an entirely new 90° V8 direct injection (DI) inter- cooled engine with a water-cooled turbocharger. Its fuel injection system employs a fully electronically controlled common-rail sys- tem that has high-pressure injection capabilities. Isuzu had the design responsibility of the base engine, while General Motors Corporation Truck Group was responsible for designing the installation and packaging within the vehicle. Engine validation relied on Isuzu' s proven validation process, in addition to General Motors Corporation Powertrain's expertise in engine val- idation. Engine calibration work in the vehicle was undertaken by a joint team of Isuzu, General Motors Corporation Powertrain and General Motors Corporation Truck Group personnel, which reflects how the engine was born as a complete collaboration of the three organizations. Engine production was started in the summer of 2000 at DMAX, Ltd., a new Isuzu and General Motors Corporation joint venture located in Moraine, Ohio. 2001-01-2704. The new common-rail fuel system for the Duramax 6600 V8 diesel engine. Kazutaka Ohishi and Tamitoshi Maeda, Isuzu Motors; and Karsten Hummel , Robert Bosch GmbH. The Bosch Common-Rail Fuel Injection System with the new technologies developed for the Duramax 6600 engine offer numer- ous performance advantages including exhaust emissions control and noise. The layout of the fuel system components and electrical parts is specifically designed to control fuel injection characteristics. The new injector and nozzle technology was integrated to achieve the required system performance. The new 1600 bar fuel pump is also a prerequisite for required system performance. 2001-01-2706. Can a single multiplex data bus suffice to serve all functions on a transit bus? Mike Klaus, I/O Controls Corpora- tion. There have been many developments during the implementation of multiplex data standards. Several proprietary data standards have been developed by various different vendors. A few industry stan- dards exist such as the SAE J1939 and the SAE J1708. Although the proprietary data standards have been working well, there has been some attempt to use the SAE J 1939 standard for all functions on all vehicle multiplex systems on the transit bus. This caused an attempt to use one single databus for all systems on the vehicle. 2001-01-2707. The development of a new concept for truck anti-roll stabilization control. John B. Reast and Mike Glass, Detroit Steel Products Co Inc. This paper describes the background and development of a new, low cost and more effective system for controlling the vehicle roll on leaf spring suspended vehicles. The new anti-roll concept is most effective and efficient when applied to the higher technology, para- bolic tapered, leaf springs. The highest gains are available when these are used on medium- and heavy-duty trucks and buses. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2708. Development of a 4-point-air cab suspension system for conventional heavy trucks. Alexander Gross and Roy Van Wynsberghe, Mannesmann Sachs AG. Driver retention poses a significant challenge to the trucking industry. Calls for improved driver comfort and more advanced cab suspensions have led to revolutionary new ideas in the development of secondary suspension systems. European trucks have long benefited from true air-ride systems with air-springs and shocks on all four corners. Conceptually such 4-Point-Air Cab Suspensions also offers significant potential for ride improvement of conventional heavy trucks. Secondary benefits include potentially improved crash safety performance and reduced dynamic forces at the cab mounting points. Existing cab suspension concepts for conventional trucks trans- mit a blend of frequencies and accelerations through to the drivers position. Whilst rear-mounted air-springs provide good isolation to all but low excitation frequencies, the front rubber mounts still transmit the harsher high frequencies. This paper presents a new design concept for a '4-point-Air Cab Suspension' on a conventional truck. Simulation results are provided to quantify the advantages of this new concept relative to current systems. 2001-01-2709. Field testing of proposed tridem truck/triaxle trailer configurations. Samuel F. Lam and Murray Love, Insurance Corporation of British Columbia. In February 2000, The Insurance Corporation of British Colum- bia (ICBC) completed the field testing and safety review of three new and two existing logging truck configurations. The three new configurations featured tridem-drive tractors pulling triaxle pole trailers (including a tridem drive straight truck) hauling long or short log loads. The British Columbia logging truck industry has been an enthusiastic proponent of tridem-drive vehicles and combinations for three main reasons: the configurations allow greater log load car- 335</page><page sequence="335">2001-01-2709-2001-01-2715 rying versatility (easy switching between hauling a single long log load to multiple bundles of short log loads); higher pay load capacity than the existing tandem drive tractor with triaxle pole trailer config- uration; and, enhanced traction on steep off-highway grades than tandem drive tractors. ICBC developed a test plan to investigate the dynamic on- highway performance of the new configurations based on the results of a computer simulation. ICBC selected an independent profes- sional engineer to carry out the tests. The tests took place in the first week of February 2000 and included tests of dynamic stability, on- highway performance, and low-speed control on slippery surfaces. For comparison purposes, two existing configurations were tested along with the new configurations. The new tridem drive tractor configurations met our safety expectations in the tests and showed the computer simulation results to be conservative. The drivers reported that the new tridem configu- rations felt stable during the test sequences and maneuvers. The field tests provided concrete assessment and confirmation on the safety of the new vehicle combination. Complied test data and technical references were listed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2710. Composite C-springs. B. S. N. Azzam and M. O. A. Mokhtar, Cairo Univ.; and Soheir A. R. Naga , Helwan Univ. During the last few decades, fibrous composite materials have been diversified and replaced some traditional metallic materials. These materials provide high strength-to-weight ratio together with high environmental corrosion resistance. One of the basic engineer- ing applications, which have been attracted by the properties of these composites, is the automotive engineering. In this paper, the authors manipulated the composite C-compression springs as a new trend of vehicle suspension system instead of coil or leaf springs. This type of springs can be safely and efficiently implemented in the vehicles' suspension systems and most probably be used in the new suspension design proposed ear- lier by one of the authors. Previous work on this context had shown a quality nature and economical technology in the use of composite springs in transpor- tation and/or industrial applications. The present study comprises a theoretical analysis of this type of springs followed by a finite element analysis. Building some numer- ical models having different geometrical configuration, lay-ups, and different fibrous materials to optimize the effects of these parame- ters on the behavior of springs had performed the numerical analy- sis. Results had shown, in general, to comply with the available experimental findings that the composite materials can be great extended to be adopted safely in the design and manufacture of vehi- cles' suspensions. 2001-01-2711. Design of an upper-control arm using shape optimization. Murali M. R. Krishna , DANA Corp. A case study of an application of shape optimization techniques in the design of an upper control arm of an automotive suspension system has been presented. An existing design of an upper control arm had high stresses and low fundamental frequency. The design- er's inputs as to the various possible shape changes, constraints of movements, etc., were built into the optimizer as shape variables and constraints. Shape optimization was then performed using approximate direct linearization method of MSC/NASTRAN soft- ware. A number of design directions were obtained. With a 24% weight penalty the first frequency was raised to 834 Hz and brought closer to the target of 900 Hz and the stresses were also brought down by 30%. 2001-01-2712. An end-user's guide to commercial vehicle measurements: Interpreting dynamic and structural tests out- side the lab. William C. Shust, Objective Engineers , Inc.; Keith B. Smith , Ingersoll-Rand Co.; and David M. G erst, International Truck and Engine Corp. Engineering tests that do not impact business decisions waste time, budgets and morale. This paper will consider input and output information for the test process - specifically in vehicle dynamics and structural integrity labs. Uncontrolled test processes are unlikely to fulfill expectations. Conversely, the process may be closely defined in a widespread specification, and yet not answer the ques- tion at hand. Potential downstream impacts of loosely defined technical details will be discussed. Topics include selection of transducers, recording parameters, filtering and analysis techniques. Physics of common environmental loading are presented, along with implica- tions for both the test plan and later use of the test data. Case studies as both a truck, bus and railroad test services provider and consumer will be discussed. 2001-01-2713. 42 volt system. Steven Lu, MTA New York City Transit. The growing electrical power demands on bus electrical systems, such as the electric door operator, power steering, braking, air condi- tioning, windshield wipers, seat heating, and the need to improve emissions and fuel economy, are making current 12/24- volt electri- cal systems inadequate. For buses to continue to meet growing cus- tomer needs, electrical power must be increased. The industry is currently pursuing a 42- volt system as standard. In the U.S., that number (42 volts) was selected by an industry-wide research consortium led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy. The switch to a 42-volt system would revolutionize the auto- motive industry. This would enable more electronic components and new technologies to be added to the vehicle. At the present time, the discussion and implementation of the 42- volt system is largely on luxury vehicles. The potential benefit of the system on heavy-duty vehicles has not been fully explored. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the impact and demand of the 42- volt system on transit buses. 2001-01-2714. Diesel engine starting using battery-capacitor combinations. John R. Miller and Susannah M. Butler, JME, Inc. The performance of battery-capacitor combinations for diesel engines starting was investigated using computer simulations. The system was comprised of a diesel engine, starting motor, one, two or three batteries and an electrochemical capacitor, which is some- times called a supercapacitor or ultracapacitor. Circuit models of each component were developed and used to examine system per- formance. Results demonstrate that adding a capacitor to the starting system can increase the peak rotation rate of the engine and in addi- tion, reduce starting system mass and volume. Significantly, system effectiveness is often greater if the capacitor is rated for and oper- ated at a voltage higher than the battery. This permits use of a smal- ler, lower-cost capacitor. The voltage seen by the starter in such mixed-voltage systems is below its rating. 2001-01-2715. Vehicle-integrated battery and power system management based on conductance technology to enable intelli- gent generating systems (inGEN®). Michael Cox and Kevin Bert- ness, Midtronics Inc. This paper will present advanced battery monitoring technology developed for integration into the vehicle system to enable true bat- tery power diagnostics and management. The paper discusses the necessary battery parameters to be measured and the diagnostics to be reported to the vehicle operator or system, including a methodol- ogy to accurately calculate true state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of- health for both cranking and reserve capacity for SLI lead-acid bat- teries. The resulting power management technology would provide continuous battery diagnostics for real-time power assurance. It would also provide measurements to enable optimized charging, effectively creating a truly intelligent and integrated generator sys- tem. Finally, the paper presents development and research data pro- duced from a system already deployed in 14V vehicle battery appli- 336</page><page sequence="336">2001-01-2715-2001-01-2720 cations (inGEN®), and introduces some initial requirements for deploying into a heavy-duty truck or bus application. 2001-01-2716. Liquid-fueled APU fuel cell system for truck application. Massimo Venturi and André Martin , XCELLISiS. Fuel Cell Auxiliary Power Units (APU) are more and more con- sidered as having the potential to improve fuel economy, to be envi- ronmental friendly and to add new functions and features to vehi- cles. There are several APU system architectures combined with dif- ferent fuels and power levels applied to various vehicles A liquid-fueled APU with a power of 5 kW can address a signifi- cant market potential in the field of transportation systems. The future higher-voltage architecture and the increasing electrical power demand on board of vehicles are two of several drivers that make the APU solution interesting for many applications. XCELL- SiS, The Fuel Cell Engine Company, is developing and manufactur- ing APUs for automotive application. In this paper, the potential of APUs, their market, and their appli- cation, are presented. 2001-01-2717. Development of a software-based 'virtual fuse' for use in electronic control of electrical loads. Edward Kelwaski, International Truck and Engine Corp. The increased use of power field-effect transistors instead of power relays for controlling electrical loads on vehicles has created an opportunity for the development of a software-based virtual fuse. This development has several important aspects to the vehicle OEM. Not only will the cost of the fuse be saved along with the cost of the fuse holder, but also perhaps the largest cost associated with using a traditional fuse: the wiring to and from the fuse. In commercial vehicles, the variability of one vehicle to the next may force different circuits to occupy the same physical space on the different vehicles. These differing circuits may also require dif- ferent values of fuse elements. Ensuring that the correct fuse value is installed under these conditions can be a difficult task at best. Having a software-based virtual fuse that can be programmed to match the vehicle configuration can eliminate having an unprotected circuit due to an assembly error. The development of a software-based virtual fuse must be well executed. The end result is far too risky to allow assumptions and/or errors to creep into the development. The goals must be clearly defined and testing of the final product must be thorough and brutal. Before beginning the development of a software based virtual fuse, the facts regarding conventional wiring and fuses should be gathered. The only facts that this author uncovered that were perti- nent to the development were: 1) Fuses have protected vehicle cir- cuits for many years. 2) The Society of Automotive Engineers has published testing recommendations for the performance of circuit protection devices. These two facts, not assumptions or opinions, should guide the development of a software-based virtual fuse for use in electronic control of electrical loads. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2718. Academic/technical education: A partnership approach for a truck and diesel technology program by Chicago Public School system and International Truck and Engine Corp. Ernest E. Stinsa and Edward H. Howell III ', International Truck and Engine Corp. In an effort to revitalize academic/technical education, to have it closer reflect the needs of students entering post-secondary educa- tion programs, and to prepare other career-minded students for industry positions, the Chicago Public School system under the direction of Mr. Paul Vallas, CEO, sought the assistance of industry leaders to assist his endeavor. He was interested in having academic/ technical education programs feature state-of-the-art technology and reflect 'world of work' methods. The focus was to cultivate skills and competencies that would qualify students for employment, or meet their post-secondary education needs. This paper describes the partnership formed between the Chicago Public School system and International Truck and Engine Corpora- tion. Mr. John R. Home, Chairman, President and CEO, viewed the request as one addressing a meaningful need and provided an oppor- tunity for International to support the community and city of Chi- cago. He has directed the program progress since its inception. The paper describes the approach employed to develop the pro- gram, from its inception through implementation, and as an on- going course. The program is a three-year course of instruction for Medium/Heavy-Duty Truck and Diesel Engine Technicians, offered to students at the Chicago Vocational Career Academy (CVCA) High School. Described in this paper are the program curriculum, daily lesson plans, and the approach to classroom instruction that includes the support from experienced industry personnel. It describes some unique equipment developed to stimulate student participation. It describes the facility, with the arrangement and function of its class- rooms and laboratories. Included in the program are summer intern- ships for juniors, Education To Careers program for seniors and full- time employment for graduates. The importance of having mentors counsel and support students is discussed. The approach to establishing formal articulation agreements (university credit for course work at CVCA) between CVCA and post-secondary schools is discussed. The paper includes a discus- sion on the team approach that enabled the program to earn Master Certification with Academic Recognition by the National Automo- tive Technicians Education Foundation (NATEF). The Class of '2001' represents a program milestone, i.e., they were the first graduates. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2719. Six-cylinder in-line turbocharged diesel engine crankshaft torsional vibration characteristics. Jouji Kimura, Ryoji Kai, and Satoshi Shibata, Isuzu Motors Ltd. Engine crankshafts have been designed to avoid low-harmonic- order resonant torsional vibration in a commonly used engine speed range, but the authors have found that, in some engines, especially turbocharged engines, a significant degree of a low-harmonic-order exciting torque acts on the crankshaft. In these engines, the ampli- tude of non-resonant low-harmonic-order torsional vibration is almost as large as that of the resonant one. The authors conclude that the 3rd-order non-resonant torsional amplitude is not only signifi- cant but also characteristic of the turbocharged engine in compari- son with the naturally aspirated engine, and recommend that crank- shafts on turbocharged diesel engines should be made stiffer than those on naturally aspirated engines. 2001-01-2720. The effect of contact pressure on piston ring twist. V. Dunaevsky, Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems ; S. Alex- androu, Institute of Problems in Mechanics; and F. Barlat, Univer- sity of Aveiro. The paper is a step in an ongoing work targeted at the develop- ment of an engineering methodology to estimate sealing properties of a piston ring, and for the development of ring design guidelines. This work is necessary because the sealing properties of a ring sig- nificantly affect oil passing and blow by in the reciprocating air compressor and engines. It is known that the sealing function of a piston ring depends on the ring's ability to elastically deform in its plane under its own ten- sion by conforming to the deviations of the cylinder bore. At the same time, if it has an asymmetrical cross section, the ring fitted in the cylinder bore is subjected to the additional, three-dimensional, distortions called twist. This type of cross section is usually imparted to the ring to further improve its sealing functions by inter- locking (because of twist) between the piston groove and the cylin- der wall. However, there is no available engineering recommenda- tion that relates ring design parameters to the twist. 337</page><page sequence="337">2001-01-2720-2001-01-2728 This paper is an extension of the authors' previous works and demonstrates analytically the effect of contact pressure between the piston ring and cylinder wall on the piston ring twist, using the shape of the cross section and the mechanical characteristics of the ring as input. 2001-01-2723. Droplet deformation and rotation model of fuel spray in diesel engines. Zhengbai Liu and Xinqun Gui , Inter- national Truck and Engine Corp. A droplet deformation and rotation model (DDR) has been devel- oped and implemented in the KIVA II CFD code for better describ- ing characteristics of liquid fuel sprays in diesel engines, including the distribution of sprays in combustion chamber space and the spray/wall impingement. The DDR model accounts for the effects of both the droplet' s frontal area and its drag coefficient as a func- tion of its deformation and rotation on droplet drag and droplet breakup. Therefore, the DDR model can be used for calculating the fuel droplet' s drag and breakup in the process of combustion in die- sel engines. This makes it possible to model the highly distorted droplet' s frontal area variation and its effect on the drag coefficient in sprays. The new version of the KIVA II code with the DDR model has been tested for a case of the spray/wall impingement and a case of the combustion process in a diesel engine. The results from numerical calculation by using the new version of KIVA II code with the DDR model and the corresponding experimental data are in good agreement for both cases. In addition, in the spray/wall impingement case the effect of the DDR model has been seen to be very important on both the spray penetration and the wall spray height after impingement. In contrast to earlier models, it has been found that the calculated data are insensitive to the choice of the breakup time constant Bi after impingement. This indicates that the physics of droplet destabilization processes following wall impinge- ment are accounted for more reasonably with the DDR model. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2725. Tools for occupant protection analysis. Paul M. A. Slaats and Wookeun Lee, TNO-MADYMO North America ; and Venkatesh Babu and Kevin R. Thomson, DaimlerChrsyler Corp. The design of occupant restraint systems in the automotive industry has shifted from an empirical approach to a computer-aided analysis approach for many years now. Various finite element soft- ware programs have been applied in crash safety analysis, and multi- body dynamics codes have been successfully used where quick sys- tem response times were required. Most new vehicle programs are analyzed by the use of finite element tools that were used for previ- ous program projects. Software that has specific occupant protection features may be coupled with these finite element tools, or new vehi- cle programs may be developed from scratch by using one tool that does all, i.e., a tool where the multibody dynamics are integrated into the finite element method. Both these approaches will be elabo- rated as valid tools for occupant protection analysis. At first, the coupling between the finite element crash program LS-DYNA and the F.E./multibody program MADYMO will be addressed by a fron- tal impact application. Secondly, this same example will be worked out in the F.E./multi-body program MADYMO only. It will be shown that in case the LS-DYNA vehicle model is already available, the coupling with MADYMO is a very efficient way to get occupant analysis results. The alternative method to work out the vehicle and occupant analysis in one and the same crash code, i.e., MADYMO, has some advantages too. A decision tree as to what method is to be preferred in a specific stage of a vehicle program is suggested. In this way, the crash safety analyst is supported to make the right choice between the various tools for occupant protection analysis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2726. Analysis of truck-light vehicle crash data for truck aggressivity reduction. Daniel Blower, Vasanth Krish- naswami, and Devi Putcha, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute; and Alrik Svenson, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the University of Michigan Transportation Institute are investigating truck design countermeasures to provide safety benefits during col- lisions with light vehicles. The goal is to identify approaches that would best balance costs and benefits. This paper outlines the first phase of this study, an analysis of two-vehicle, truck/light vehicle crashes from 1996 through 1998 using several crash data bases to obtain a current description and determine the scope of the aggres- sivity problem. Truck fronts account for 60% of light vehicle fatalities in colli- sions with trucks. Collision with the front of a truck carries the high- est probability of fatal (K) or incapacitating (A) injury. Truck sides account for about the same number of K and A injuries combined as truck fronts, though injury probability is substantially lower than in crashes involving the front of a truck. Light vehicle involvements with truck rear ends result in about half as many fatalities and seri- ous injuries as either the front or side of a truck, but injury probabili- ties are higher than crashes involving truck sides, probably due to the light vehicle underriding the truck. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2727. Roll over prevention based on state-of-the-art ABS systems. Gusztav Holler and Joseph Macnamara, Bendix CVS - Honeywell Inc. The benefits of roll over prevention (ROP) or even roll over warning systems are obvious: besides potentially saving human lives, goods and vehicles they may save on insurance costs and help educate drivers and promote better driving habits. Various brake system manufacturers offer several ROP systems, but they are all common in one respect, namely that they are hosted by an Electronic Braking System (EBS) system. In general, based on sensory obser- vation, the danger of a particular situation is judged by a central ECU and if necessary, brakes are actuated individually, independent of the driver's intention, to improve the vehicle's stability. Although the feature is very attractive, the market seems slow to accept new technologies, particularly in view of the additional price overhead of EBS compared to current ABS braking systems. A better short- term low-cost solution is to realize an ROP algorithm on common ABS systems for trailers. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2728. Improved drum brake performance predic- tion considering coupled thermal and mechanical effects. Rajesh Somnay, Shan Shih, and Paul Johnston, ArvinMeritor Inc. This paper presents a methodology for predicting drum brake performance using FEA (finite element analysis) models consider- ing both the mechanical-structural compliance and thermal effects. The methodology for brake torque prediction with FEA models con- sidering the structural flexibility of the brake components alone has been established. The frictional heat generated during braking causes thermoelastic distortion that modifies the contact pressure distribution at the drum-lining interface. In order to capture this thermal effect, a transient thermal analysis is conducted to predict the transient temperature distribution on the brake components. In the thermal analysis, the heat generated at the drum and lining inter- face is based on the pressure distribution from the compliant mechanical model. Also, the mechanical properties of the brake components as well as the lining friction are dependent on the tem- perature distribution. The mechanical and thermal models are thus tightly coupled. During a braking event, the system goes through a series of geometry and temperature distribution changes. For each time segment, the brake torque can be calculated based on the meth- odology presented. With that, the vehicle's stopping distance can be calculated. Inherent to the analytical implementation of this proce- dure is the ability of the FEA models to accurately simulate the ther- mal and structural behavior of the drum brake system. These struc- tural and thermal FEA models form the core of die process to simu- late entire braking event. The paper describes the FEA model devel- opment and validation process as well as a case study, which 338</page><page sequence="338">2001-01-2728-2001-01-2735 implements an adaptation of the general procedure. This simplified procedure lends itself to effective product development support. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2729. Approach of debugging control laws of ABS combined with hardware-in-the-loop simulation and road experiment. Huiyi Wang , Bo Gao, and Jian Song, Tsinghua Univ. Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) is an important control system that can improve the automotive performance, reliability and safety obviously. Hardware-in-the-loop Simulation (HILS) testing is a promising method to assistant design automotive electronics system. In the State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, a HILS system was established to assistant design ABS. The HILS system is composed of a hydraulic control unit of ABS, a normal brake system, a commercial personal computer, a data acquisition card, and several signal-conditioning modules. Powerful software was programmed to perform managing input and output signals, solving 7-freedom and 15-freedom vehicle models, and acquiring response signals of the brake system. Based on the simulations of HILS system, the road experiments with the same conditions of ABS are very necessary and important. In this method, the combination of HILS and road experiment rap- idly reduce the cycle of design and debugging the control laws of ABS in automobile. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2731. Self-optimizing brake control design for com- mercial vehicles. Cem Hatipoglu, Bendix Commercial Vehicle Sys- tems, Honeywell; and Yu Hai and Ümit Özgüner, Ohio State Univ. This paper focuses on the design of a self-optimizing nonlinear controller for a 4 simplified' pneumatic brake system in the continu- ous time domain. The specific controller under investigation period- ically excites the brake system in the direction towards the maxi- mum tire forces without a priori knowledge on the initial direction of motion. The nonlinearity and complexity of pneumatic systems (as opposed to hydraulics) introduce a higher level challenge. The developed controller employs multiple observers to estimate tire forces in a highly unpredictable environment with bounded parame- ter uncertainties. The controller explicit inputs are the wheel speeds and chamber pressures. A longitudinal accelerometer is also recommended. 2001-01-2732. The effect of kingpin inclination angle and wheel offset on medium-duty truck handling. Ragnar Ledesma and Shan Shih, ArvinMeritor Commercial Vehicle Systems. The effect of kingpin inclination angle and wheel offset on vari- ous vehicle performance metrics such as steering effort, vehicle han- dling, and steering system vibration is described in this paper. A simple ADAMS model of a medium-duty truck has been developed for this study. The front axle consists of an idealized solid axle sus- pension with suspension system components represented by rigid bodies. The tire model used in this study is a linear tire model, and estimates of tire force coefficients were obtained as an average of several published estimates of medium-duty truck tires. Experimen- tal design procedures (DOE) have been conducted to determine the effects of kingpin inclination angle and wheel offset on various steering system performance measures. For each performance met- ric, a 2-variable (KPIA and wheel offset), 5-level DOE was per- formed using the full factorial matrix for a total of 25 tests for each performance metric. The KPIA was allowed to take on values of 6.25°, 7.0°, 7.75°, 8.5°, and 9.25°. The wheel offset was allowed to take on values of 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 inches. The results of each DOE study provide a measure of the sensitivity of each perfor- mance metric to the individual and combined effects kingpin incli- nation angle and wheel offset. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2733. Feasibility of modifying an existing semi- trailer air suspension into an anti-rollover system. Adam Senalik, Ruhl &amp; As sodate s -Forensic, Inc.; and Juraj Medanic, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This paper examines the feasibility of modifying an existing semi-trailer air suspension system to function as an anti-rollover system in addition to its normal suspension operation. The semi- trailer model used is a dynamic, two-dimensional system. The anti- rollover system controller is formulated using projective control the- ory. All other factors being equal, simulations show that use of the modified suspension system decreases the weight shift when the semi-trailer undergoes lateral acceleration. By decreasing weight shift, the modified suspension system decreases the possibility of rollover. 2001-01-2734. Validation of ADAMS® models of two USMC heavy logistic vehicle design variants. Andrew S. Elliott, Mechani- cal Dynamics, Inc.; and Gregory Wheeler, Nevada Automotive Test Center. ADAMS® models of two proposed designs for the USMC Logis- tic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), have been fully validated against test track data for both durability and handling events. The LVSR vehicles are 45-ton, straight-frame, 10x10 trucks with four- axle steering. One candidate design uses fully independent spring- shock suspensions on all ten wheels. The second design used a com- bination of trailing arm and walking-beam air suspensions on the rear three axles. Response data were acquired for the two prototype vehicles over the Perryman III, ISO double lane change and 12-inch half-round courses at various speeds up to maximum vehicle/driver capability. The ADAMS models of these vehicles were carefully constructed using a combination of manufacturer-supplied and measured data. They were instrumented analogously to the test vehicles and simu- lated over the same courses using automatic speed and steering con- trollers. Example results are shown for both vehicles over a repre- sentative sample of events. Correlation of the ADAMS models to the test data is very good overall, including power train, wheel travels and seat and frame accelerations. Especially notable is the use of a new combination handling/durability tire model which was able to capture even the extreme response to the half-round event, which includes both mul- tiple tire hops and compression up to 75% of tire height. The models can now be used for both absolute and comparative performance analysis of the competing design concepts. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2735. Web-based engineering for product develop- ment and business support. Scott Kuan, Shan Shih, and Jim Grant, ArvinMeritor, Inc. Nowadays, developing web (World Wide Web) engineering is considered to be a top priority task in many companies. A corporate web information center with broad coverage to support a company's worldwide engineering activities can make the product development and customer support more efficient. First, the archived, readily available product information, knowledge database, and user- friendly engineering tools can ease up the more ever-demanding engineering jobs. Second, the convenient information storage, retrieval systems and hyperlinks on the web should ensure effective communications among engineers, customers and suppliers. How- ever, without in-depth planning, the full benefits of web engineering cannot be realized. To be effective, other companion engineering programs must also be instated. This paper reviews the experience we have gained in utilizing web engineering for product develop- ment and customer support. The discussion will cover four types of engineering tool development: Product Design and Development, Communication, Sales and Marketing, and Customer Satisfaction. In each subject the discussion will cover both the program develop- ment, and issues and suggestions. 339</page><page sequence="339">2001-01-2738-2001-01-2742 2001-01-2738. Application of an electronic instrument cluster as a node in a multiplexed vehicle electrical system. Deborah M. Payne y International Truck and Engine Corp. The primary function of a gauge and information display cluster is to report to the driver the current state of the different systems of the vehicle and particularly to report out of range performance con- ditions. This paper will examine one implementation of the instru- ment cluster as a node on the J 1939 data link as it relates to that functionality. Traditionally clusters have received their information from a variety of sensors requiring a substantial number of connec- tions. Once the cluster is installed in the vehicle, changing the con- figuration may only be accomplished by means of a hardware change. Today's multiplexed instrument cluster also receives and processes information from a variety of sources for display as gauge data, warning light status, and selected gear information, specifi- cally from the engine controller, electrical system controller, and the transmission controller, but with a significant reduction in the num- ber of electronic, hydraulic, and pneumatic connections to the mod- ule. This is ultimately due to the roll the instrument cluster plays as a node on the data link. Because the cluster is a node, sensors need not be directly connected to it. Instead the cluster receives data from other nodes in the system. Along with the reduction of sensors, a central benefit of the multiplexed system is an increase in the con- figuration flexibility. Additional gauges may be added to the cluster without adding any wiring. The cluster gauges and warning lights are configurable based on data from an electrical system control module. There is also an increased flexibility in messages config- ured based on engine and transmission. The gear selection graphic or PRNDL on the integral digital display can also be reconfigured for use with a variety of transmissions. The multiplexed cluster is also capable of displaying additional diagnostic information in its supplemental digital display along with storing and broadcasting diagnostic messages on the data link. Being a part of a multiplexed vehicle system greatly improves the instrument cluster's function- ality as a fault-reporting device. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2739. Multiplexed operator control switches in a modular package. Gary Pomeroy, International Truck and Engine. The increase in the number of electronics in Trucks, and the resultant increasing in wiring, has led to an inevitable emphasis on reducing wiring harness size and complexity. The use of Multiplex- ing allows the application of additional electronics without propor- tional increases in wiring. Multiplexing also adds the benefits of increasing the flexibility in electronics placement (modularity) and thereby reducing incorrect wiring. By utilizing the J1587/J1708 SAE standards in modular switches, these capabilities can be achieved, but with many challenges not normally seen in these tradi- tionally simple devices. The keys to acceptance are to keep the capabilities of present control switches, reduce the wiring complexity in manufacturing, provide flexibility for bodybuilders, and to gain the acceptance of truck operators. This paper is an overview for the architecture of one method to implement multiplexed control switches, discuss the hardware design challenges, and an overview of the software imple- mentation necessary to provide modularity and bodybuilder flexibility. 2001-01-2740. A vehicle electrical system architecture based on a multiplexed design for operator controls and indicators. Robert Dannenberg , International Truck &amp; Engine Co. Increased features content, with electrical effects, have produced tremendous complexity in the design and support of the electrical system for commercial vehicles. Using individual wires coupled with various electro-mechanical components, to implement electri- cal system features, is no longer a desirable solution. Adding more wires and connectors reduces reliability and makes diagnosing elec- trical failures rather cumbersome. Likewise, customizing a vehicle with a specific set of features, by using discrete wire designs, make the assembly process prone to error. This paper explores a new approach to a vehicle electrical archi- tecture that uses multiplexed wiring methods coupled with a pro- grammable central control module. The most novel feature of the system is that the main electrical system control module may be reprogrammed with a unique set of vehicle features as required by each customer order. Additional benefits of the system include an ability to add more input/output capability to the electrical system by adding various general purpose circuit modules, as nodes, on the back bone of vari- ous serial data communication links on the vehicle. Likewise, infor- mation gathered from these modules may be shared with any of the other intelligent electrical system components, which minimizes redundant sensors and lowers overall vehicle cost. Due to increased communication between intelligent circuit modules on the vehicle, more of the electrical system may now be diagnosed, either with on- board displays or by off-board diagnostic equipment. This new approach allows the set of vehicle features offered and ultimately much of the electrical design, to be managed from a soft- ware database, instead of through thousands of combinations of wire harness designs using 'hard-wired relay logic. 'Building upon that capability, now the vehicle order to manufacturing process may be automated to further enhance the speed and agility of the OEM to provide exactly what the customer wants. 2001-01-2741. One example of a software architecture for a configurable, intelligent vehicle electrical control system. Gregory Jean-Baptiste and Michelle Cambrón , International Truck and Engine Corp. The increasing complexity of the electrical and electronic sys- tems on trucks requires a more sophisticated electrical control sys- tem. Replacing many of the discrete electronic controls and wiring with a central Electrical System Controller (ESC) allows for easier integration of system components and improved system response. The use of software control within the Electrical System Controller, provides opportunities for enhanced system capabilities and a fluid platform for future development. This paper examines the software architecture employed within an Electrical System Controller and also examines the factors that govern the software's design. These include a requirement for the ESC to be highly configurable to accommodate a variety of features desired by customers. The chosen hardware platform for the Electrical System Control- ler consists of an electronic assembly with a central processor that monitors multiple analog and digital inputs and data from SAE J1939(CAN) and SAE J 1708 networks, to determine the state of the various systems on the truck. The system inputs are processed through software modules. The results of this software processing are high current outputs, relay driver outputs, and messages sent out on J 1708 and J 1939 networks. The ESC software allows for advanced diagnostics including the ability to detect faulty sensors, wiring faults, overcurrent conditions, and errors in data link trans- mission and reception. Fault conditions can be sent to the electronic gauge cluster for display and can also be made available for retrieval by diagnostic tools. 2001-01-2742. Experimental and computational investigation of Ahmed body for ground vehicle aerodynamics. Ilhan Bayrak- tar, Drew Landman, and Oktay Baysal, Old Dominion Univ. External aerodynamics remains one of the major concerns in designing a new-generation road vehicle. In the present study, the external aerodynamics of an Ahmed body at a scale and Reynolds number, that are representative of a car or light truck at highway speeds, is explored. An experimental model test was compared with a computational model using various back angles. In addition, the experiment allowed lift and drag to be measured at yaw angles up to ±15 degrees. Reynolds number effect on drag and lift coefficients was studied and wind-averaged drag coefficients were calculated. 340</page><page sequence="340">200 1 -0 1 -2742-200 1 -0 1 -275 2 The numerical calculations used a Reynolds-averaged, unsteady Navier-Stokes formulation. Both experimental and computational results are presented for back angles of 0-, 12.5-, and 25-degrees, then compared with each other and the data available in the literature. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2743. A two-dimensional external aerodynamics tool (EAT) for simulating airflow around tractor-trailer combina- tions. Andrew S. McLandress, DaimlerChrysler Research and Tech- nology North America ,; Wolfram Wiese , Rheinisch Westfälische Technische Hochschule; and James Turney and Josef Loczi, Freigh- tliner LLC. Understanding external vehicle aerodynamics is an integral step in reducing overall vehicle fuel consumption. This is particularly true for long-haul commercial vehicles where an incremental decrease in drag can translate into significant fuel savings based on the number of miles traveled over the course of a truck's working life. The ability to critically analyze the air motion adjacent to com- mercial vehicles is a step toward understanding the overall affects of external aerodynamics on the entire vehicle. To achieve this understanding, the aerodynamics problem must be divided into manageable tasks that can each yield qualitative and quantitative results. A two-dimensional (2D) External Aerodynamics Tool (EAT) has been developed that enables computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of commercial vehicles to be performed quickly and easily. The approach is significantly automated and uses tools of ICEM CFD Engineering and FLUENT™ as well as a highly cus- tomized user interface to produce fully quadrilateral grids and CFD solutions from the original CATIA™ CAD data. The simulations are based on centerline cross-sections of entire tractor-trailer combi- nations. Although the complete vehicle is included in the simulation, the CFD results are meant to guide the design of grill bars, sun- visors and profiles of hoods, windshields and roofs. EAT is intended to enable designers to make informed design decisions based on aerodynamic performance while taking into account styling consid- erations. This leads to shorter design cycles and minimizes proto- type costs through reducing the necessary number of design varia- tions to be tested through more in-depth methods such as three- dimensional CFD analysis or wind tunnel testing. A validation of EAT has been performed through a series of simulations of an NACA 4415 airfoil as well as a sun-visor similar to the Freightliner Century Class production sun-visor. Finally, a brief description of the application of EAT within a sun-visor pre-optimization design study is presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2744. The impact of aerodynamics on vehicle perfor- mance in a Formula SAE racing style vehicle. Badih A. Jawad , Maria M. Longnecker , and JoHanna S. Timmer , Lawrence Techno- logical Univ. Aerodynamic drag is the force that restricts the forward velocity of a vehicle. Sources of drag are form drag, interference drag, inter- nal flow drag, surface friction, and induced drag. Aerodynamic drag directly impacts the fuel economy attainable by a vehicle. In the For- mula SAE competition (FSAE), fuel economy is a factor during the endurance phase. This paper will focus on the effects of aerody- namic drag and how it impacts the fuel economy of a FSAE racing style vehicle using the Lawrence Technological University (LTU) 1999 and 2000 cars to study and evaluate various methods to reduce drag and optimize fuel economy. Theoretical and experimental methods will be used and the study will be limited to the effects of form and interference drag. 2001-01-2747. Evaluation of brake system performance for transit bus operation and maintenance. Alexandr Neyman, MTA New York City Transit. Improper brake system performance and braking force distribu- tion on transit buses causes vehicle instability during braking directly affecting its handling and safety. It also affects vehicle maintenance cost due to premature brake component and tire wear. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the transit industry's experi- ence regarding brake testing, that would help to evaluate system per- formance, using the most efficient and inexpensive method (depend- ing on the required task) available at this time. A successful discus- sion within the SAE may suggest a guideline to agencies responsible for vehicle safety (e.g., DOT) to review and then establish require- ments for bus brake system design and evaluation technique and criteria. This will in turn positively effect transit industry operation and maintenance. 2001-01-2748. Energy management strategy and parametric design for hybrid electric transit bus. Chu Liang and Wang Qingnian, Jilin Univ. In this paper, the practical configuration of power train for a series hybrid electric transit bus (HETB) is introduced. Based on the analysis of the operation modes, the energy management strategy has been developed, which can operate the engine, generator and motor within its highly efficient range as much as possible and keep the battery state of charge (SOC) at reasonable level. The parameters of the power unit (included engine, generator, motor, battery, trans- mission) are calculated and discussed in details according to the vehicle requirements for maximum cruising speed, acceleration time, grade ability, and fuel efficiency. The simulation results show that, this transit bus would have comparable performance with cor- responding conventional one, much better fuel economy, and a unlimited range by the battery storage energy. 2001-01-2750. Human-machine interfaces for advanced multi-media applications in commercial vehicles. Peter RöBger and Jörg Hofmeister, CAA AG. Advances in technology have led to a growing integration of assistance and entertainment systems into cars, trucks and buses. Applications such as navigation, telephone, audio, and speed control are state of the art. In the realm of cars, office applications such as internet or e-mail will soon turn Driver-Information Systems into advanced CarPCs. Trucks are equipped with telematic fleet- management appliances, buses with sophisticated entertainment systems. Additional systems provide information about tire pressure or the state of the engine. While these new developments provide valuable information, using them on the road draws the driver's attention, thus posing safety risks. Today's dashboards consist of many different user-interfaces for different applications. To improve usability and safety, integrated systems should provide a single human-machine interface for all sub-systems. 2001-01-2751. A methodology of using topology optimization in finite element stress analysis to reduce weight of a structure. Murali M. R. Krishna, DANA Corp. A methodology of using topological optimization technique for bring down the weight of a structure has been discussed. Special variables are defined for each of the finite elements, which are related to the thickness, density and Young's Modulus of the mate- rial. A Topology optimization problem is set up to solve for these special variables. The major advantage in this method is that the user can give additional stress and displacement constraints. Optimiza- tion solvers, which can handle discrete variables, are required. At the end of the optimization the special variables are snapped on to predefined extreme values which determine which elements could be successfully eliminated to reduce weight of the structure. 2001-01-2752. Leveraging product configurators in service parts and aftermarket applications. Bradley A. Geistwhite, Inter- national Truck and Engine Corp. 341</page><page sequence="341">2001-01-2752-2001-01-2764 Product configurators are employed to select and spread bills of material for production builds. Service parts and aftermarket parts typically do not participate in the product configuration process. It is assumed that service parts are identical to, or directly related to, the parts used in production. This is not always the case. Often ser- vice requires a bill of material that differs significantly from the pro- duction bill - most commonly when customers request add-on fea- tures at the dealership. Requests for add-on features may occur soon after the delivery of a newly built vehicle to a dealer or any point in the operational life of the vehicle. There is an opportunity to leverage production order coding and product configuration processes to support the product after produc- tion build. Products with significant complexity and variation may benefit from a 'service configuration' process in addition to the 'production configuration' process. A service configuration process would select service-specific bills of material - bills of material that would otherwise not be spread during production order coding. Ser- vice configuration can occur either post-production build at the time of a customer request, or simultaneously with production coding in anticipation of a future customer request. 2001-01-2753.

Carnahan, and L. V. Inendino, Ruhl and Associates - Forensic, Inc. and University of. This paper investigates the coefficients of static and kinetic fric- tion between the hardwood flooring of a used semi-trailer and the bottom surfaces of both an old and a new hardwood pallet, with varying cargo weights, at varying locations in the trailer. A total of 22 tests were performed with the pallets moving parallel to the lon- gitudinal axis of the trailer and perpendicular to this axis. The results show that the variations in load did not statistically affect the friction coefficients. The older pallet had statistically smaller static and kinetic friction coefficients (s=0.32, k=0.26) than that of the newer pallet (s=0.35, k=0.29). The static friction coeffi- cients were statistically dependent upon whether the test took place at the front (0.36), middle (0.34) or rear (0.32) of the semi-trailer. Kinetic coefficients behaved similarly: front (0.29), middle (0.27) or rear (0.26). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2759. Design for manufacture of cab-in-white parts with sheet metal forming simulations. Stephen Dudra, Interna- tional Truck &amp; Engine Corp. The development of new sheet metal stampings represents a con- siderable risk to a new program because it requires long lead times to develop and test the parts and dies. If forming problems are dis- covered late in the product development process, there can be seri- ous consequences to the program cost and delivery. This work dem- onstrates the benefits of using advanced forming simulation soft- ware early enough to avoid forming problems by making changes to part and die designs. The objective of this work was to identify and eliminate forming problems in the sheet metal stamping opera- tion of the large, complex body panels prior to prototype builds. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2760. System modules, the impacts on truck cab assembly. Thomas E. Harting, International Truck and Engine Corp. This paper will review and discuss the advantages and disadvan- tages of utilizing modular systems in vehicle assembly, particularly Medium-Duty, Severe Service, and Heavy-Duty trucks. Focus will be put on cab interior modules, as they were developed for the Inter- national 4000, 7000, and 8000 series trucks. For the purposes of this paper, 'system'or 'system module'refers to an assembly of compo- nents that can wholly or substantially perform its design function as a stand-alone unit. An example would be a vehicle seat assembly. A completed seat can perform its intended function sitting on the plant floor, as well as in the vehicle. The impacts of the system module design approach on assembly processing, manufacturing complexity, reliability and quality, and design and validation will be discussed. Various levels of system modularity have been successfully used in recent years in many types of vehicle manufacturing, particularly in the automotive industry. However, the wide variety of vehicle applications and con- figurations that are inherent in the diverse customer needs of the medium-duty, severe service, and heavy-duty truck markets intro- duces new issues that are not necessarily significant in the manufac- ture of passenger cars. 2001-01-2763. Truck durability evaluation through com- puter simulation. Edward Chase, International Truck and Engine Co. This paper outlines four computer simulation methods for pre- dicting durability of cab-in-white (CIW) structures, using MSC. Nastran and MSC.Fatigue. The quasi-static method combines iner- tial relief stress responses and load time histories to perform the durability analysis. The frequency-based method uses frequency- dependent stress responses and time histories transformed into the frequency domain. The transient method calculates durability per- formance from stress response time histories. The modal superposi- tion method combines normalized modal responses with modal time histories to perform durability predictions. Advantages and disad- vantages of each technique are described. Manhours and computer resources for each method are compared. 2001-01-2764. Development of a multi-body dynamic model of a tractor-semitrailer for ride quality prediction. Dave Ander- son and Gre d Schade, International Truck and Engine Corp.; and Stacey Hamill and Patrick O' Heron, Mechanical Dynamics, Inc. Increasingly, manufacturers are looking to computer simulation methods to accurately assess ride quality potential of new vehicle designs as they are being developed. This requires detailed multi- body dynamic models to be developed with sufficient fidelity to rep- licate ride relevant phenomenon. These models must have the capa- bility to: - Represent the distributed mass and elasticity of the vehi- cle structures (e.g., frame ladder, cab, and trailer). - Include the non- linear behavior of shock absorbers and elastomeric components. - Reproduce the fundamental system dynamics that influence ride. - Provide output of the acceleration, velocity, and displacement mea- sures needed to compute ride quality. This paper discusses the development of an ADAMS multi-body dynamic model of a tractor semi-trailer for use as a predictive tool in evaluating ride quality design improvements. The model includes flexible representations of the frame, cab, and trailer generated from finite element models through the use of component mode synthesis. Non-linearities and viscoelastic effects associated with compliant elements and dampers are selectively incorporated using explicit functions and spline/surface interpolation. Road inputs into the sus- pension are generated via tire elements in contact with road profiles or by prescribing axle motions. Additionally, a ride quality algo- rithm is built into the model allowing virtual ride measurements to be taken and compared to physical test results. Construction and correlation of the model followed a multi-step process in which each of the major subsystems were built and vali- dated to test results prior to incorporation in the full vehicle model. Ride data from a vehicle instrumented with 70 transducers was col- 342</page><page sequence="342">2001-01-2764-2001-01-2773 lected on highway routes and used to support full vehicle correla- tion. The ability of the model to predict ride quality variations due to changes in vehicle configuration was tested by evaluating several case studies. These results are presented along with details of the model construction and correlation process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2765.

Effect of heavy vehicle suspension designs on dynamic road loading - A comparative study. Mahyar Naraghi and Esmael Najaf zadeh, AmirKabir University of Technology. In this paper road damage caused by heavy vehicles is studied. The effects of passive, semi-active and active suspension designs on dynamic road loading are compared. Attention is given to develop an accurate vehicle model with useful tandem suspension behavior. A nonlinear two-dimensional model of tractor-semitrailer is consid- ered. The model includes nonlinear behavior of leaf spring and tan- dem suspension in the trailer axles. To obtain accurate results, a realistic road profile model is considered. The control scheme of the semi-active suspension system is based on the modified skyhook damper model. For the active suspension control system design, due to nonlinearity in the vehicle model, a linear quarter vehicle model is considered. Then linear quadratic optimal technique is employed to design the control law. Two road damage criteria were applied to assess the vehicle performance: The dynamic road stress factor and the 95th percentile dynamic loads. Simulation results of the vehicle model with the three suspension systems are presented. Based on the first criteria, road damage for semi-active and active suspensions compared with that of passive suspension is reduced by 4.9% and 8.1%, respectively. Also based on the 95th criteria the road damage for semi-active and active suspensions compared with that of passive suspension is reduced by 18.5% and 36%, respectively. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2767. The making of a High Performance™ Truck - Philosophy, strategy, organization and processes behind International's new lineup. Jacob Thomas , Mike Roeth, and Mark Staseli, International Truck and Engine Corp. International Truck and Engine Corporation introduced a new line of High Performance trucks based on its next-generation medi- um-duty platform in February 2001. The new 4000 series that reached full production in April 2001 was the first in a series of models based on this platform to be introduced over the next two years. The new platform will replace all but the heaviest trucks in International's lineup. Even though the primary focus of Interna- tional's next-generation product is addressing the needs of the own- ers, drivers and maintainers of the truck, the new product is also a key enabler for the execution of International's business strategies of cost and complexity reduction. Integral to the attainment of inter- nal objectives was International's ability to develop products on a common platform to serve across fairly diverse markets. This paper outlines the philosophy and strategies that gave definition to Interna- tional' s $650 million 'Next Generation Vehicle' (NGV) develop- ment project and the organization and processes employed during four years of its development. The paper is organized in sections that describe selected elements of strategy development, concept devel- opment, design, test and launch. Each section will reflect on some of the best practices adopted and key lessons learned at major stages of development. 2001-01-2768. Testing control systems of trucks and truck- trailer combinations with hardware in the loop - Very real tests in a virtual world. Andreas Riedel and Alexander Schmidt, IPG Automotive Corp. This article presents state of the art of modern hardware-in-the- loop systems for testing electronic chassis control systems in trucks and in truck/trailer combinations. In the last few years, hardware-in- the-loop has proven to be a time- and cost-saving testing method for passenger cars, ideally complementing real driving tests. Due to the increasing functionality and complexity of chassis control systems in trucks, HIL will certainly prove to be a key technology for testing control systems of trucks. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2769.

The issues in test case design, to maximize test coverage for a highly combinatorie configuration capability, are reviewed. Then, the role played by the Electronics Integration Test Station [EITS] to evaluate test items as an element of test case design and conducting the tests is reviewed. EITS provides a hardware-in-the-loop test facility for evaluating vehicle electronic control systems. Finally, the coverage achieved is compared with the coverage required as determined by analysis of the order content of vehicles and the analysis of the configurable electronic control system design information. 2001-01-2773. Hybrid electric systems for 20-ton platforms. Carl Johnson, U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Com- mand; and Lorin Dueck, United Defense L.P. 343</page><page sequence="343">2001-01-2773-2001-01-2781 Hybrid electric propulsion has matured to the point that it is in production for small vehicle platforms. Work still needs to be done on adapting the technology for heavier weight classes.

A dual-use hybrid electric command and con- trol vehicle. Michael A. Kluger , Southwest Research Institute; Don Szkubiel, U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command; and Edward A. Bass , General Motors Corp. Until recently, U.S. government efforts to dramatically reduce emissions, greenhouse gases and vehicle fuel consumption have pri- marily focused on passenger car applications. Similar aggressive reductions need to be extended to heavy vehicles such as delivery trucks, buses, and motorhomes. However, the wide range of torques, speeds, and powers that such vehicles must operate under makes it difficult for any current powertrain system to provide the desired improvements in emissions and fuel economy. Hybrid electric powertrains provide the most promising, near-term technology that can satisfy these requirements. This paper highlights the configuration and benefits of a hybrid electric powertrain capable of operating in either a parallel or series mode. It describes the hybrid electric components in the system, including the electric motors, power electronics and batteries. In addition, the paper illustrates the installation of this hybrid electric hardware into a 17,000 kg (GVW) military vehicle based on an RV chassis. The analyses of the new system show that conventional benchmarks for performance and fuel economy can be met or exceeded. In fact, fuel economy increased 50 percent on an urban cycle and 25 percent on average for five different cycles. Finally, the benefits of this powertrain for military initiatives such as the 21 st Century Army and 21st Century Truck Initiative will be dis- cussed, including how the Dual-Use Hybrid Electric Command and Control Vehicle can provide a source for up to 150 kW of auxiliary electrical power. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2777. A report on advantage of a heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicle. Tatsuo Kiuchi, Makoto Ogata , Masato Iizawa, Takashi Yanase, Yuta Susuki, Nobuaki Takeda, and Naotake Kuma- gai, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. In its efforts toward reduction of exhaust emissions and fuel con- sumption, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC) is currently developing a large, hybrid electric route bus that uses its market- proven diesel engine for driving the electric generator and hence does not require a new infrastructure. This report describes the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) system's specifications, the mechanism that enables the system to work effec- tively, and the results of the simulation and tests carried out to evalu- ate the system's performance of reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. It also describes the noise reduction and other merits the system involves. 2001-01-2778. An analysis of shutdown for an operational fuel cell transit bus. Michael J. Heckwolf Paul A. Erickson , Timo- thy C. Simmons, and Vernon P. Roan, University of Florida. The shutdown process of an operational phosphoric acid fuel cell transit bus has been investigated. The bus employs a hybrid arrange- ment of a 50 kW Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC) engine in paral- lel with Nickel-Cadmium batteries on a 30-foot heavy-duty transit bus chassis manufactured by Bus Manufacturing Inc. The bus uses methanol as the primary fuel, which is processed through a steam- reformer to produce hydrogen used in die fuel cell. Rapid cooling of PAFC power plants will induce component damage. Shutdown of the fuel cell bus is defined as the time that is required for the con- trolled reduction from operating temperatures within the fuel cell stack and reformer to minimize component degradation. While in general fuel cell vehicles produce low emissions and are very effi- cient while operating, shutdown of the fuel cell bus represents a sig- nificant time requirement, power and fuel consumption, and consid- erable pollutant emissions with no usable output power. A descrip- tion of the shutdown procedure for the bus, fuel and power usage, average time required, and analysis of emissions data are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2780. Application of modal analysis and operating deflection shapes on the study of trucks and buses dynamic behavior. Leandro Pugliese de Siqueira and Felipe Nogueira, Volk- swagen Truck and Bus Operation. The application of modal analysis and operating deflection shapes (ODSs) in the study of structural vibration problems has been known for years. But these tools are also very useful in the study of vehicle dynamic behavior. This paper presents applications of these experimental tech- niques on the study of the dynamic response of trucks and buses. It also discusses the relationship between modal analysis and operat- ing deflection shape measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2781. Auxiliary axles - An axle manufacturers per- spective. Arthur T. Bonsignore, ArvinMeritor Inc. Auxiliary non-driven axles are sometimes added to heavy-duty trucks, tractors and trailers in order to increase vehicle load capacity (load bearing) or to meet bridge law regulations (load sharing). The number of auxiliary axle installations, done either at the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) level or in the aftermarket, is on the rise. When properly engineered and used, the performance, dura- bility and reliability can all be satisfactory. When misapplied or mis- used, the results can be serious. Proper consideration must always be given to the load carrying capacity of the primary steer and pri- mary drive axles, especially if the auxiliary axle is of the liftable variety. A thorough system evaluation of the vehicle must go beyond a simple Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) summation of the rating of the individual axles. It must account for all possible loading conditions on all of the axles. To avoid axle overloading, the plated GVW may need to be less than the GVW rating summation of the axles. While the deployment or retraction of a liftable axle is always the responsibility of the driver, more specific training and certifica- tion is required. Typical driver training programs provide insuffi- cient exposure to auxiliary axles and lack sufficient detailed instruc- tion to better acquaint the driver with the added responsibilities associated with vehicles equipped with an auxiliary axle. 344</page><page sequence="344">200 1 -0 1 -278 1 -200 1 -0 1 -2790 This paper looks at each of the mentioned issues for auxiliary axles from the perspective of an axle designer, manufacturer, and tier one supplier to all the major heavy-duty truck OEMs. In addi- tion, the paper discusses typical axle design and validation methods and describes various types of vehicle and axle configurations. Load changes imposed on the primary axles as a consequence of axle placement are examined and analyzed. Finally, the paper makes rec- ommendations to ensure that the proper implementation and usage of auxiliary axles are fully understood. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2782. Co-simulation of driveline torque bias con- trols. Chia-Shang Liu , Vincent Monkaba, Hyeongcheol Lee , Todd Alexander , and Venu Subramanyam , Visteon Corp. Simulation is considered as an essential activity to save time and cost of building physical prototyping hardware. However, systems from different engineering domains such as control system design, mechanical design, or hydraulic design generally requires different simulation tools. To tackle this situation, the method of co- simulation is applied to communicate between different processes during simulation. It is served as the foundation of sophisticated vir- tual prototyping system simulation activities. This paper presents the effort at Visteon of applying co-simulation to design and verify the electronically controllable torque bias device. The controller modules are developed in MATLAB. ADAMS is applied to create a high-fidelity virtual prototyping vehicle model. The vehicle model is then modified to integrate the function of torque bias control devices. The co-simulation of the controller modules with the vehi- cle model is performed by using ADAMS/Controls. The simulation is used to study several winter test conditions on packed snow or icy road. A tire model fitted with laboratory test data is implemented during the simulation. Experimental data from the field test are used to correlate the results of co-simulation. Well-correlated simulation results with the field test data show the promise of designing and verifying driveline torque bias control as well as other control mod- ules in virtual prototyping environment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2784. Vehicle trade-offs and considerations on emis- sion-driven engine changes. Anthony J. Cook, International Truck and Engine Corp. Many systems in a vehicle are affected by the engine. As such, changes made to the engine can have far reaching implications that require sub-system level, system level, and in some cases vehicle level trade-off decisions in order to accommodate the changes. The inputs needed to make these trade-off decisions come not only from across the functions within Engineering but also from the larger enterprise. There are many ways to address the emissions-driven engine changes but vehicle engineers are challenged to find solu- tions that either minimize the impacts of the changes or make the impacts acceptable within trade-off considerations. Among the trade-off considerations are cost, vehicle configuration, time, fuel economy, noise, durability, and visibility. 2001-01-2785. A multi-dimensional approach to truck under- hood thermal management. Timothy P. Nobel and Sunil K. Jain, International Truck and Engine Corp. The purpose of this paper is to describe a methodology that sig- nificantly streamlines the process of truck underhood thermal man- agement by utilizing state-of-the-art computer simulation of airflow and heat transfer. The traditional approach has been to package underhood components in the vehicle design phase based on past experience, build a prototype, test it, analyze the test results and determine any necessary design changes. The design changes are implemented and the cycle is repeated until an acceptable design is achieved. The alternative methodology, described in this paper, uses a complete 3-D CAD model of all pertinent underhood components of a heavy-duty truck with a general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code to simulate underhood airflow. The heat exchangers -condenser, charge air cooler, oil cooler and radiator - were modeled using a 2-D approach that divides the heat exchanger core into cell zones and computes heat rejection cumulatively from zone to zone. As the cooling fan performance has a significant influ- ence on airflow across the heat exchangers, the detailed geometry of the blades were considered in the fan model which was intro- duced in the overall computational domain using a multiple refer- ence frame approach. These multi-dimensional models were cou- pled to provide an integrated methodology to assess the underhood airflow and heat transfer characteristics that can be applied both proactively early in the design process - and reactively to analyze problems that occur with production vehicles. Results from the underhood simulation were compared to test data compiled during the development phase of a truck and are reported in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2787. International Truck and Engine High Perfor- mance Vehicle driveability - Ride and handling. Tony Sutton, Rob Pope, Ken Brandewie, and Jeff Henry, International Truck and Engine. This paper describes the methodology and results of International Truck and Engine Corporation's High Performance Vehicle pro- gram with respect to the targeting and achievement of Best-in-Class Driveability for medium-duty trucks. The Driveability initiative is an ongoing and evolutionary program at International and encom- passes the areas of powertrain performance, driver environment, ride and handling. This paper specifically addresses the ride and handling portions of the Driveability initiative and the manner in which the best possible balance of these attributes was determined and obtained. The first step in the process was to determine the desired metrics of the program and measure the characteristics of competitive as well as our own current production and pre-prototype High Performance Vehicles (HPV). In parallel with this benchmark- ing effort, several design option 'levels' were developed which gave us the ability to progressively modify and improve our systems to achieve the desired performance targets derived from the bench- marking effort. Following the initial testing phase, the required sys- tem design modifications were selected and prototype systems were obtained and installed in such a manner as to allow iteration of key parameters and to 'dial in' the resultant performance levels. These system installations were then benchmark tested and analyzed to ensure that the final design would provide the targeted balance of ride and handling to satisfy the requirements of the International Driveability initiative. 2001-01-2788. Improving PLC performance with an integral filtering module. Eric DeWilde, Phillips Industries. The introduction of PLC4Trucks to 'light the light' introduces new complexities to the wiring system of the tractor and trailer. To electronic equipment not designed to read the PLC4Trucks signal, it appears as undesirable high-frequency noise on the input power line. In addition to the interference generated by PLC4Trucks for non-PLC electronics, these same non-PLC electronics can generate noise, which can interfere with the PLC4Trucks signal. This paper outlines the development and implementation of a filter module that reduces both of these effects while improving the signal strength at the Tractor ABS ECU. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2790.

Custom configuration of a vehicle electrical control system for production and service. David Holscher, Inter- national Truck &amp; Engine Corp. International Truck Engineering has incorporated a cab electrical system controller (ESC) into their vehicle design. This was done to facilitate a larger number of configurations with a simpler hardware design. The ESC makes use of SAE J 1939 and J 1708 to communi- cate with instrument cluster, door, power train and other modules. It also has various discrete inputs and outputs. A proprietary operat- ing program written for the ESC uses a set of binary configuration structures stored in flash ROM and includes a proprietary 'byte code' interpreter. The configuration describes how to process all I/O signals to/from a central data array, byte code to execute and the instrument cluster layout. Byte code operates on the data array between input and output processing. The switches and gauges in the instrument cluster plug into network modules. Due to the variability of the International Truck &amp; Engine vehi- cle products, the content of the ESC configuration can vary widely from vehicle to vehicle. It is the IT (Information Technology) orga- nization's task to provide a specific configuration for each ESC. Based on customer-ordered features, the configuration must contain the proper byte code modules, I/O processing and cluster configura- tion information. IT must also select the proper switches, gauges and warning lights and their locations, as well as match the discrete I/O to signals on pre-existing wiring harnesses. The software and hard- ware included in the configuration must be validated to prevent soft- ware and hardware conflicts. In addition to the initial configuration, IT must also provide vehi- cle service support. This includes reconfiguration of the ESC for software updates, recall support and customer-driven additions or modifications. The system that IT developed to solve these issues is discussed. 2001-01-2793. Design of an advanced heavy tactical truck: A target cascading case study. Nestor Michelena, Loucas Louca, Michael Kokkolaras, Chan-Chiao Lin, Dohoy Jung, Zoran Filipi, Dennis Assanis, Panos Papalambros, Huei Peng, and Jeff Stein, University of Michigan; and Mark F eury, U.S. Army Tank- automotive and Armaments Command - Tank. The target cascading methodology is applied to the conceptual design of an advanced heavy tactical truck. Two levels are defined: an integrated truck model is represented at the top (vehicle) level and four independent suspension arms are represented at the lower (system) level. Necessary analysis models are developed, and design problems are formulated and solved iteratively at both levels. Hence, vehicle design variables and system specifications are deter- mined in a consistent manner. Two different target sets and two dif- ferent propulsion systems are considered. Trade-offs between con- flicting targets are identified. It is demonstrated that target cascading can be useful in avoiding costly design iterations late in the product development process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2794. Hybrid propulsion truck platform dually developed by the U.S. Army and DaimlerChrysler. Hal Almand, U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command; and Wil- liam Doolittle and Gerry Klees, DaimlerChrysler Corp. This paper provides an overview of the Hybrid Electric Commer- cially Based Tactical Truck (COMBATT), a collaborative program between the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Com- mand's (TACOM) National Automotive Center (NAC) and the DaimlerChrysler Hybrid Electric Vehicle Platform Engineering Group. As part of the 21st Century Truck Initiative, the COMBATT platforms represent the class 2b (light) trucks. The platforms contain all of the utility and enhanced off-road capability features of the baseline COMBATT platform plus the second generation of a hybrid propulsion system incorporating an integral auxiliary power supply. The hybrid feature increases fuel efficiency, expands opera- tional capability by providing a limited range electric propulsion mode, and enables an extended auxiliary electrical power supply capability. The auxiliary power supply provides up to 20 kW of con- tinuous electric power and 30 kW of peak electric power for on- or off-board applications. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2795. Telematics for 'SmarTruck'. Mitchell Kozera, GerMaine Fuller -Simms, and David J. Gor sich, U.S. Army Tank- automotive and Armaments Command. The utilization of commercially based technologies has the abil- ity to greatly reduce the time and cost of military vehicle develop- ment. Commercially based technologies also enable the transition of a high level of capability into the military vehicle inventory and to the Army's ultimate customer, the soldier. The Army's National Automotive Center (NAC) has created SmarTruck, a light truck platform enhanced for military concept exploration. SmarTruck is outfitted with telematics, safety, and non-lethal weapon systems technology. It is a prime example of the NAC' s central focus, which is dual-use commercial technology transfer. At the core of success for SmarTruck is the application of telematics technologies includ- ing embedded diagnostics, advanced electronic architectures, tele- maintenance, and wireless communications. 2001-01-2797. A ride comfort design sensitivity analysis of a city bus. Peter Eriksson and Olof Friberg, SCANIA CV AB Buses &amp; Coaches and Chalmers University of. A design sensitivity analysis, using concepts from design and analysis of experiments, of a city bus with respect to ride comfort is presented in this study. The response of the city bus, due to differ- ent types of road excitations, is calculated using a FE model of the complete bus. A global discomfort measure for the current bus design is thereafter calculated by evaluating the discomfort at three locations within the bus using the comfort standard ISO 2631:1997. Four different road excitation load cases are considered. In the first case prescribed vertical displacements, simulating a test-track road, are applied under all tires. In the second case vertical displacements, simulating the rear axle of the bus traversing a rectangular obstacle of full road-width, are equally prescribed under the left and right rear tires. In the third and fourth cases, the same obstacle shape is considered but now applied in turn to the rear tires. In total 26 design variables, such as dimensions and positions, in the wheel suspen- sion, body structure and power unit insulation are defined. Design effects are calculated, using fractional factorial design, for each load case and compared in order to find the design variables, or combina- tions of variables, that most effectively affect the ride comfort char- acteristics of the bus. 2001-01-2800. The virtual truck. Ralph Stratton and David Rowe, North Devon College. A study examining the problems and benefits derived from the development of a fourth-generation CD-ROM learning program for the truck sector. Discussion will consider two key criteria: The vision Intuitive learning programs based on real world imag- ery and expectations. The techniques used to retain the learner's interest, and facilitate personal motivation. The development process of a learning program which uses pre- viously unattempted levels of imagery, and the promotion of active learning and learning by association. The key to the development will be the design of a minimal text interface termed The Virtual Truck,' which uses real- world visual prompts to guide the learner.

Some aspects of parasitic drag in dry friction clutches. Andrzej Szadkowski and Ronald B. Morford, Meritor Clutch Co. Clutch drag is caused by friction between clutch parts and adja- cent components having different rotational speeds when the clutch is released. The root cause of drag is the presence of normal reac- tions between friction surfaces when the clutch is disengaged. In most cases, especially in multiple disc clutches, these reactions can- not be eliminated but they can and should be minimized by proper design. The major difficulty in dealing with drag problems is associated with the relatively small magnitudes of drag torque in comparison to useful torques carried by the drivetrain. From the history of drag problems, especially in the automotive industry, it appears obvious that the problem of dragging clutches has no single solution. There are many potential sources of friction forces contributing to drag torque. In addition, contributions from particular sources are very small and not necessarily consistent. Many external disturbances, and some independent variables in drag problems, are strongly sto- chastic in their nature. Their conclusive measurement under indus- trial conditions seems to be very problematic. On one hand, there is a problem with accuracy of measurement and on the other hand, in industrial conditions, all significant items involved in the drag phenomenon cannot be tested or observed. Therefore, engineers have to resort to sampling. Any sampling in drag problems has proven itself to be impractical. Drag tests are usually non- repeatable. In this situation the authors try to deal with some practi- cal questions: what is a practical way of dealing with dragging clutches and what is a practical way of making design improve- ments? This paper includes some design recommendations to reduce drag and a strategy for dealing with drag cases in industrial condi- tions. It also presents a specific design problem for the spline inter- face. Drag, introduced by friction forces between the hub and input shaft splines, is investigated for various design parameters of the hub. The determination of threshold conditions for self-locking on the spline is included. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2803. Forming simulation and stiffness prediction of a rear axle pinion bearing collapsible spacer. Yian Liu and Vin- cent D. Monkaba, Visteon Driveline. This paper presents a method to predict the nonlinear spring rate of an axle pinion bearing collapsible spacer with special consider- ation for manufacturing residual stress and strains. Typical manu- facturing forming operations of the pinion bearing spacer can pro- duce 5 to 30% residual plastic strain, resulting in significant change to its mechanical performance. Thus it is very important for the design engineer to include the effects of residual stress and strain in the collapsible spacer design process. To accurately predict the residual stress and strain in a spacer, and hence accurately calculate its spring rate non-linear finite ele- ment analysis is performed to simulate the entire manufacturing pro- cess. The non-linear CAE analysis has 3 simulation steps: (1) die forming; (2) collapsible spacer system assembly and; (3) spring rate prediction with residual stress-strain information. Since the choice of material constitutive laws and hardening properties may signifi- cantly affect the accuracy of the finite element simulation, four dif- ferent material models [2] are evaluated and compared with experi- mental result. The four different material models evaluated in CAE modeling are: (1) elasto-perfect plastic material model with iso- tropic hardening (2) elasto-perfect plastic material model with kine- matic hardening (3) true stress-strain material model with isotropic hardening (4) true stress-strain material model with kinematic hard- ening. Through comparing CAE and test results, it is found that material model 4 3' is the best material model for this type of applica- tion. Using material model '3 'and CAE analysis, several different design alternatives for a drive-shaft spacer design are evaluated and an optimized design is obtained. This paper also discusses the accuracy of calculated results com- pared with experimental test. Accuracy of the analysis was within 8% of the experimental test. 2001-01-2804.

Morford , Meritor Clutch Co. Recent technological advances in electronics have strongly affected the medium- and heavy-duty truck industries. Modern truck engines supply much higher torques over a wider range of rotational speeds than their predecessors of just a few years ago. Drivetrains with "new generation 'engines and 'old generation 'clutches most often have resonances that are spread over the entire operating range. Consequently, these powertrains experience large torsional oscillations accompanied by considerable dynamic overloads. This implies a special responsibility binding clutch manufacturers. New clutches must not only have higher torque capacities, much lower damper rates and longer working travels, but they also must be pack- aged in the very limited environment allowed by the old designs. Newly redesigned LTD discs produced by the Meritor Clutch Company meet these new demands. As a modular product the LTD disc has been designed to comply with today's rigorous dynamic requirements. Smoothing dynamic loads while being very robust, it will enhance the performance of the entire drivetrain. This paper not only describes the modifications and new features of the product, but also chronicles an investigative effort that was undertaken to research deficiencies in existing designs, such as fre- quent fatigue failures and the excessive wear of the clutch and other drivetrain components. Special considerations are devoted to issues of non-parallel compression of the damper springs and to the design of the spring to pocket interface, including transformations associ- ated with dynamic deflections within the damper. Emphasis is placed on the degree to which computer-aided engineering tech- niques were employed during the design process. In conclusion, the paper discusses current trends in the truck industry. Especially highlighted is the unquestionable propagation of a systems engineering approach, which will be followed by changes in the way automotive products are designed. 2001-01-2807. A tool for predicting interior sound package treatment in a truck. Pranab Saha, Kolano and Saha Engineers , Inc.; Thomas J. Henry , International Truck and Engine Corp.; and John Chahine and Gregory T. Demrose , Lear Corp. This paper discusses an analytical tool that has been developed to predict what types of interior sound package treatments may be necessary in a truck cab to meet a predetermined target sound level at the driver location. The steps that were taken to develop this tool involved a combination of experimental measurement and analytical based studies. Measurements were conducted to identify the acous- tic strengths of the major noise paths through which sound travels from outside to inside the truck. These findings were then used to develop a sound package that reduced the vehicle interior noise to meet the target. Measurements were primarily made on a chassis roll dynamometer with final road verification to substantiate the dyna- mometer data. Data obtained from these measurements were also used in the analytical model that predicts the impact of various acoustics parts in the vehicle, and has the capability to optimize the sound package treatment in the vehicle. 347</page><page sequence="347">2001-01-2808-2001-01-2815 2001-01-2808.

Drivetrain noise and vibration troubleshoot- ing. Shan Shih, Jacinto Yruma, and Phil Kittredge, ArvinMeritor Inc. Conducting effective drivetrain NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) troubleshooting is difficult because its execution requires commanding knowledge and experience on complicated vehicle system interactions. This is especially true for commercial vehicles due to the wide variety of available powertrain and chassis configurations and broad spectrum of vehicle applications. Further- more, access to revenue-producing commercial vehicles is often limited. Problem solving must be carried out within a tight schedule. Under these circumstances, a practical drivetrain NVH trouble- shooting guide will come in handy. The objective of this paper is to document the 'know-how' we have learned. Subjects covered in the discussions are underlying physics, problem diagnosis, solu- tions, and problem avoidance. The problem-solving methodology and solutions for various powertrain NVH problems are exemplified by six case studies: Powertrain Torsional Vibration, Powerpack Sys- tem Bending Vibration, Neutral Idle Gear Rattle, Coasting Gear Rattle, Gear Noise, and Transmission Shift Lever Jump-out. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2810. Optimum engine mounting layout by genetic algorithm. Tetsuya Sakai, Isuzu Advanced Engineering Center, Ltd.; Mitsuo Iwahara, Isuzu Motors Ltd.; Yutaka Shirai, Sophia Univ.; and Ichiro Hagiwara, Tokyo Institute of Technology. In this study, the genetic algorithm so-called GA is newly applied for the optimization of many engine mounting parameters, calcula- tions of stiffness matrix and inverse matrix to obtain 6-degrees-of- freedom displacements at mounting points and a center of gravity. As a result, the optimized result could be shortly obtained in a min- ute, and an inexperienced engineer could easily make the optimum engine mounting layout, which can satisfy the vibration isolation and the non-interference in an engine compartment. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2812.

A numerical analysis on the optimum distribu- tion of an air-conditioning duct with multiple outlets in a medium bus. Min-Ho Kim, Kia Motors Corp.; and Dae-Hoon Lee and Yoon-Ki Lee, Chonnam National Univ. The air distribution duct with multiple outlets is an essential part of the automotive air-conditioning system in a bus. The estimation of airflow rate in an automotive air-conditioning duct is typically very complicated due to large variations in cross-sectional area and abrupt changes in flow direction, as well as unbalanced distribution of the flow. This paper describes numerical simulations performed for two simplified air-conditioning ducts used in a medium bus. The three-dimensional Navier-Stokes code was used to evaluate the overall pressure, velocity field, and distribution rate at each diffuser according to the change of cross-sectional duct area and diffuser area. In addition, a one-dimensional program based on the Bernoulli equation was developed to obtain the optimum diffuser area required to equalize discharge flow rate at each outlet. The results of this analysis were compared to the results obtained from experi- mental measurement and CFD simulation. This experimental analy- sis confirmed that a duct constructed in accordance with the opti- mized design produced equally distributed flow at each outlet, within a range of ±9%. The simple and convenient one-dimensional analysis technique developed in this study can be applied as a practi- cal and useful tool for designing air-conditioning ducts. 2001-01-2814. Cooling system development and validation for the urban bus. Jerry Higgins, Harry Oberg, and Carl Persaud, MTA New York City Transit. Transit buses operate in very dusty and debris-laden urban envi- ronments. These conditions quickly result in clogged or restricted engine coolant radiator and charge-air-cooler cores despite the best maintenance efforts. This coupled with normal degradation of the anti-recirculation baffling, etc., results in reduced cooling capacity. This underscores the need for transit buses to be equipped with ade- quately sized units capable of maintaining optimum cooling system performance under degraded conditions. Unless specified by the purchases, bus OEMs are not motivated to provide cooling packages with enough excess capacity to maintain this optimum engine per- formance under real- world conditions. This paper shares NYCT's efforts and experiences in its quest to develop and test cooling sys- tem units capable of delivering desired performance under clogged and degraded conditions. In an aggressive repower program, NYCT tested cooling systems on Orion V and Nova buses with Series 50 EGR-equipped engines. These emission-enhanced engines operate with increased heat rejection to the cooling system in comparison to the original 2-cycle 6V92 ENGINES. With engine compartment real estate at a premium, design options were limited. In addition, some options can compound the clogging problem (for example, increased fan size, core thickness and core fin density). Qualified cooling packages for this program were required to pass the engine manufacturer's requirements under simulated degradation condi- tions such as 25% blockage of the face area of the cooling unit. Test- ing was performed on a test track with a towed dynamometer. A description of the test plan, including simulated degradation condi- tions, will be presented along with the analyzed data obtained. The Nova bus was also tested in a low-speed wind tunnel under con- trolled conditions. The data obtained from testing several cooling packages will be discussed and comparisons made with the test track results. The conclusions obtained from reviewing both sets of test results will be presented and recommendations made for upgrading or specifying cooling system requirements, which parallel the needs dictated by the service environment. 2001-01-2815. Development of continuous dilution factor for CVS emissions sampling and calculation. Jin Gang Fu, W. G. Wang, and D. W. Lyons, West Virginia Univ. During the last three decades, the emissions measurement system for heavy-duty vehicle testing has employed a Constant Volume Sample (CVS) system to continuously measure the pollutant con- 348</page><page sequence="348">2001-01-2815-2001-01-2825 centrations in the dilution tunnel. Subsequent gaseous emissions cal- culation methods were based on Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 (CFR-40) in which a formula for calculating dilution factor (DF) was specified to account for background pollutants. However, it is recognized that due to the mechanism of the CVS systems, the dilu- tion factor varies from a constant during a test cycle. The DF calcu- lation technique can introduce error in the emissions data, but the magnitude of potential error is small relative to the current emis- sions standards. However, as the engine technologies improve and cleaner burning fuels are adopted in the near future, the pollutant concentrations from engines will approach those in ambient air. In that case, the current calculation method in CFR-40 can result in errors that are relatively large. In this study, a new approach was developed to calculate instantaneous DF during a test cycle for natu- ral gas vehicles equipped with oxygen sensors. This new method has improved the accuracy of emissions measurement and calculation, which would be desirable when testing vehicles with near zero emis- sions. The instantaneous dilution factor is also used to calculate the emissions concentrations in the raw engine exhaust prior to being diluted. The emissions characteristics at different engine operation modes were analyzed for natural gas engines and the measures for reducing emissions were also discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2817. Powertrain Transfer Path Analysis of a Truck. Vinod K. Singh , Nitin Wani, and Vincent D. Monkaha, Visteon Corp.; and Jason R. Blough, and Geoffrey Gwaltney , MTU. A project to perform a powertrain Noise Path Analysis (NPA) on a two-wheel rear drive vehicle was performed at Visteon Corpora- tion. Research engineers gained insight into the NPA procedure as applied to a typical medium-duty production pick-up truck. Visteon' s interest in this project was two folded. First, to do a full experimental Noise Path analysis (NPA) and then, develop a meth- odology to integrate the experimental measurements and analytical results into a unified model to predict the responses at passenger interface points within a vehicle. This presentation will cover the details of the experimental NPA including measurement locations, transducer types and placement, elastomeric mount characterization, and the matrix inversion pro- cess required for indirect force estimation. Both the direct mount method and the indirect force methods based on matrix inversions were used for several mount locations to allow the estimated forces from two independent methods to be compared for accuracy and verification. Finally, subsets of forces were estimated from analyti- cal models and compared to the experimentally determined forces. This process allows Visteon to predict passenger response inter- face point amplitudes from a combination of their Finite Element Powertrain models and P/F body measurements supplied by the OEM to characterize the transfer paths. This process gives Visteon the ability to enhance their driveline subsystem NVH performance relative to the sensitivities for the receiving body structure. 2001-01-2818. Estimating safety benefits for the IVI Genera- tion 0 field operational tests. N. J. McMillan, McMillan Asso- ciates; and A.-C. Christiaen and G. V. Stark, Batte lie Memorial Institute. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) established the Intelligent Vehicle Initiative (IVI) Generation 0 Field Opera- tional Tests (FOT) to demonstrate the effectiveness and encourage the deployment of intelligent vehicle safety systems (IVSS). This paper presents a methodology for estimating potential safety bene- fits of IVSS from such FOTs. The metric chosen is potential reduc- tion in number of crashes resulting from widespread deployment of the IVSS. The methodology is based on the apprąach developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Federal High- way Administration, and the Volpe National Transportation Sys- tems Center. New features of the methodology include rigorous esti- mates of crash probabilities combining analytical models with FOT data and detailed investigation of the variability associated with ben- efits estimates. Although millions of miles will be driven in the IVI Generation 0 FOTs, few crashes are anticipated. Thus, the proposed methodol- ogy cannot rely on analysis of crash data alone. Instead, the pro- posed methodology partitions all crashes according to the driving conflict preceding each crash. It then looks simultaneously for a reduction in either exposure to driving conflicts (exposure ratio) or chance of a crash after a driving conflict has occurred (prevention ratio). While estimating the exposure ratio depends only on the FOT data, estimating the prevention ratio involves both the FOT data and a modeling component. The modeling component considers driving conflict outcomes besides those observed in the FOT. 2001-01-2820. Analysis of off-roadway crashes for intelligent commercial vehicle applications. Linda Ng Boyle and Wassin G. Najm, United States Department of Transportation. This paper presents the results from an analysis of off-roadway crashes involving commercial vehicles (large trucks - medium and heavy trucks) in support of the roadway departure research area, part of the United States (US) Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle Initiative. This analysis deals with off-roadway crashes in which the first harmful event occurs off the roadway after a vehicle in transport departs the travel road due to loss of control or crossing the edge of the roadway. Approximately 136,000 such crashes were reported in the US over a 3-year period based on the 1996-1998 National Automotive Sampling System/General Estimates System crash databases. 2001-01-2821. Methods for in-vehicle measurement of truck driver postures. Steven K. Jahns, PACCAR ; Matthew P. Reed, Uni- versity of Michigan Transportation Research Institute; and H. Lenora Hardee, International Truck and Engine Corp. Effective application of human figure models to truck interior design requires accurate data on the postures and positions of truck drivers. Errors in positioning of figure models propagate to errors in reach, visibility, and other analyses. This paper describes methods used in a recent study to measure in-vehicle driving postures in Class 6, 7, and 8 trucks. A three-dimensional coordinate measure- ment machine was used to measure body landmark locations after a driver completed a short road course. The data were used to vali- date posture-prediction models developed in a previous laboratory study. Vehicle calibration, driver selection, and testing methods are reviewed. 2001-01-2822. Creating a 3-D digital human model for truck, bus and heavy machine design. Casey J. Pruett and Peter A. van der Meulen, Tecmath of North America, Inc. A truck or bus driver's designed workspace must meet ergo- nomie federal regulations as well as provide a safe and comfortable working environment for the entire potential driver population. As more trucks, buses and heavy machinery are being designed com- pletely within 3-D computer-aided design (CAD) environments, it is essential to also address ergonomics in a 3-D digital environment. Three-dimensional digital human models (3DDHM) allow design- ers to visualize and economically assess the interaction between operators and the vehicle workspace in digital design environments. This paper outlines the process of creating a valid 3DDHM for truck, bus and heavy machine design. Proper tool application stems from a thorough understanding of how the tool was developed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2825. Fuel economy improvements in an SUV equipped with an integrated starter generator. George N. Simopoulos, John A. MacBain, Eric D. Schneider, and Elwood W. Wingeier, Delphi Automotive Systems. North American sales of light-duty trucks, including sport utility vehicles (SUV's), have now passed the 50% mark of total vehicles sold. This fact, along with the recent surge in gas prices, has drawn 349</page><page sequence="349">2001-01-2825-2001-01-2877 attention to the lower average fuel economy of this vehicle class. With possible changes to the light-duty truck corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards looming on the horizon, vehicle manu- facturers are looking for ways to improve the fuel economy of these vehicles without affecting performance or utility. One possible solu- tion in accomplishing this objective is the 42 volt integrated starter- generator (ISG). The ISG offers the ability to reduce fuel consump- tion through the use of engine-off during coast-down and idle, early torque converter lockup with torque smoothing, regenerative brak- ing, and electrical launch assist. It also boosts the onboard power generation and energy storage, allowing for increased vehicle elec- trical loads. Conservative estimates using vehicle simulation models have shown the potential fuel savings to be as much as 5-7% over the FTP -75 driving schedule from stop-start functionality alone. This paper will detail the fuel economy benefits offered to SUV's having an engine stop-start function implemented with an ISG. Dynamometer test results for a Ford Explorer equipped with a Del- phi-designed Energen-10® ISG are presented. A comparison is made to the results of Delphi- enhanced ADVISOR® vehicle simulations. A strong correlation is shown between the two sets of results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-2870. Collisional charging in ice and charge separa- tion in thunderstorms. J . G. Dash and J. S. Wettlauf er, University of Washington. Laboratory and field studies indicate that thunderstorm electrifi- cation can be attributed to rebounding collisions between small ice particles and hail. The fundamental mechanism of charge separation has defied explanation for many years, but recent experiments offer new clues, leading to a quantitative theory of the microphysical pro- cess. The theory explains the systematic dependence of charge and mass transfer on temperature, collision speeds and growth rates that have been observed in laboratory studies. Applied to storm dynam- ics, the theory describes how the upper portions of thunderclouds become positively charged, while the negative charge resides on hail in the lower regions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2871. Leader characteristics in natural and altitude- triggered lightning discharges. Xiushu Qie, Qilin Zhang , and Ye Yu, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Characteristics of the electric field changes produced by stepped and dart-stepped leaders in natural negative cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning discharges and stepped leaders in altitude-triggered light- ning discharges have been analyzed by using data from broadband slow antenna system with 0.08 ps time resolution in Guangzhou area, Southeastern China. It has been found that the characteristic parameters of leader pulses in artificially triggered lightning dis- charges are a little different from that in natural negative lightning discharges, although the discharge processes and statistic features of the pulses are similar in two cases. 2001-01-2873. The numerical simulation of the effects of lightning current arcs at the attachment point. Ralph Brocke , Friedhelm Noack, Frank Reichert, and Jens Schoenau, Technical University Ilmenau; and Wolfgang Zischank, University of the Fed- eral Armed Forces Munich. The damages and destructions on materials at the attachment point of an lightning arc are mainly caused by thermal effects. Pres- sure effects and shock waves which occur due to the high tempera- tures are mostly the consequence of these thermal processes. The calculation and prediction of the heating processes lead to a better understanding of the damage mechanisms. This allows the assess- ment and the design of materials and lightning protection components. 2001-01-2874. The use of network analysis programs for the analysis of currents flowing through anisotropic conducting structures. G. Alan Clark, The Boeing Company. The increasing use of graphite composite structures for aircraft and other vehicles has renewed interest in the effects of direct and indirect lightning strikes on these materials and the contained elec- tronics equipment and fuels. A computational method for evaluation of the effects of conduct- ing graphite using a network analysis code is described. Procedures are described for gridding quasi-two-dimensional structures embed- ded in a three-dimensional space, and for assigning the correspond- ing lumped circuit element values. Results are presented that use Excel as a preprocessing program, and the Boeing developed PRESTO code for the network analysis. The technique is also applicable to other network analysis programs such as SPICE and MICROCAP. Comparisons are made with the finite difference, method of moment =, and boundary element method computer codes with respect to predicted responses and exe- cution time versus problem size. 2001-01-2875. Resistive slab modeling for predicting light- ning currents in fastened composite structure. John A. Ward, The Boeing Company. Analysis of lightning direct-effects damage to structure and the design of test specimens and test fixtures to investigate these effects requires knowledge of structural boundary currents resulting from a lightning attachment. Since no convenient method for direct mea- surement of structural boundary conditions was available, a model called Resistive Slab Analysis at Boundaries (RSLAB) was devel- oped to fill this need. RSLAB utilizes the physical and electrical properties of interconnected structural slabs to compute the potential distribution and current flow at structural boundaries due to simu- lated lightning current injected into the structure. The analysis results are validated by measurements on a fastened composite wingbox. 2001-01-2876. New methodology for determining the exten- sion of lightning swept stroke zones on airborne vehicles. Anders Larsson, Lund Institute of Technology; Anne Bondiou-Clergerie, Philippe Lalande, and Alain Delannoy, Office National ď Etudes et de Recherches ; and Sylvain Dupraz, ALTEN. During the lightning strike to an aircraft in flight, the lightning channel gets deformed in the aerodynamic flow and displaced along the aircraft, a so-called swept stroke. To be able to correctly deter- mine the different levels of hazards on an aircraft (zoning), the phys- ical behavior of the lightning swept stroke must be understood. This behavior is outlined in the paper and a model for numerical simula- tions of the swept stroke process is presented together with exam- ples of 3D simulations. The overall objective to include this model within the frame of an operational code for zoning computations is discussed in conclusion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2877. Probabilities of catastrophe in lightning haz- ard assessments. C. C. R. Jones and D. Rowse, BAE SYSTEMS ; and G. A. M. Odam, GAO Consultancy. The airworthiness certification authorities specify overall proba- bility levels for catastrophic and less severe effects on aircraft and their occupants. In lightning standards concerning threat levels and zoning for lightning attachments we speak of high and low probabil- ities. But, despite the certification authority's overall figure, only one attempt has been made to interpret what that figure means for lightning protection. That one attempt was made under the EC funded FULMEN program to estimate the degree of accuracy needed in the process of aircraft lightning attachment zoning. With- out some figures, how do we know how good our designs have to be. Furthermore, as the number of flight-safety critical systems on our aircraft increases, how does the probability of failure of each change to ensure the overall figure remains the same? There are many figures we do not have, because lightning is too unpredictable an event, because we have too few measurements of the 'real' lightning that we are trying to protect against, and because we have too little knowledge of the science behind the whole range of 350</page><page sequence="350">2001-01-2877-2001-01-2885 phenomena involved. Despite that we can make some intelligent guesses or estimates, at least to understand where about we are. Such an analysis would be of benefit also in the debate on whether the external threat level is adequate as it is presently defined, in fur- thering the understanding of the need for fidelity in attachment zon- ing analysis, and in defining thoroughness necessary in assessing similarity between aircraft and their installations. In this paper an attempt will be made to assess these probabilities, and some of those 'guestimates'will be laid out. It is hoped that this will start some dis- cussion and hone both the numbers and the process to something of real use. 2001-01-2878. The European project EM-Haz: A consoli- dated approach to the electromagnetic threat. Mattias Severin and Bo Wahlgren, Saab Avionics.

The project is partly funded by the European Com- mission. The aim of the project is to develop methods and strategies for managing the various electromagnetic hazards to aircraft, man- made as well as natural. The research performed includes assess- ment of the electromagnetic threat, impact on aircraft equipment and materials, protective measures, verification and certification meth- odologies. The total venture includes approximately 500 man months and 8.0 MEUR over a period of forty months. 2001-01-2879. Current parameters of lightning discharges measured at the Peissenberg telecommunication tower. F. Heidler , W. Zischank, and J. Wiesinger, Federal Armed Forces Uni- versity Munich. In 1992 new lightning measurements were started at the Peissen- berg telecommunication tower. The tower is situated in the south of Germany nearby Munich. All strikes to the tower were upward initi- ated ground-to-cloud flashes except of one event identified as nega- tive downward initiated cloud-to-ground flash. The majority of the ground-to-cloud flashes were of negative polarity lowering negative charge to ground. Based on more than 100 negative ground-to-cloud flashes updated statistics of current parameters are given distinguishing between different current components, such as impulse and continu- ing currents. The statistics include the current peak values, the maxi- mum current derivatives and the full widths on half value of the cur- rent derivatives. Further, the meteorological condition and the strik- ing probability are examined. 2001-01-2880. Close lightning electromagnetic environment for aircraft testing. M. A. Uman, V. A. Rakov, J. Schoene, K. J. Rambo , J. Jerauld, and G. H. Schnetzer ; University of Florida. The University of Florida lightning research group in 1999 mea- sured the electric and magnetic fields and their time derivatives from triggered lightning dart leader/return stroke sequences at distances of 15 m and 30 m, in addition to measuring the causative currents and current time derivatives. Also recorded were the acoustic sig- nals at 3 to 30 m. In this paper, we primarily present results on fields and field derivatives at 15 m, and on currents and current derivatives. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2881. 3-dimensional lightning observations using a time-of-arrival lightning mapping system. William Rison, Paul Krehbiel, Ron Thomas, Tim Hamlin, and Jeremiah Harlin, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. A lightning mapping system has been developed that locates the sources of VHF radiation from lightning discharges in three spatial dimensions and time. The system consists of several VHF receivers distributed over an area of about 100 km diameter. The system locates VHF radiation sources over the array with an accuracy of about 100 m. The system locates sources out to 250 km from the center of the array with the reduced accuracy. The observations are found to reflect the basic charge structure of electrified storms. 2001-01-2882. Correlated sub-microsecond E-field and high- speed image of the natural lightning attachment process. D. Wang, M. Chen, N. Takagi, and T. Watanabe, Gifu University. A correlated high-speed image and E-field observation of natural lightning attachment process on a time scale of sub-microsecond has been performed. In one of the observed events, downward stepped leader pulses can be clearly identified either in E-filed or optical sig- nals. When the stepped leader approaches within about three hun- dred meters of ground, optical pulses begin to appear in the lowest 40 m channel section. These pulses have larger amplitude than the pulses from the downward stepped leader. It appears that these pulses are produced by an upward connecting leader. These facts suggest that the upward connecting leader is also stepped and it could produce even stronger pulses than the corresponding down- ward leader. The downward stepped leader has a velocity of about 4xl06 m/s, while the upward leader has the velocity of about 1.7xl06 m/s. The return stroke pulses observed in the E-field and in the opti- cal signal agree well in time but differ in fine structures. A fast tran- sition can be clearly identified in the E-field return stroke pulse, but not in the optical pulse. The return stroke has a velocity of about 1.5xl08 m/s. Based on these observed results, a model has been pro- posed to explain the slow front and the fast transition observed in the return stroke E-field fine structure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2883. New investigations of the mechanisms of light- ning strike to radomes - Part I: Experimental study in high volt- age laboratory. A. Ulmann and P. Brechet, DGA/DCE/CEAT; A. Bondiou-Clergerie, A. Delannoy, P. Lalande, P. Blanchet, and P. Laroche, ONERA; E. Bocherens, DG A/SM AJ Al A-CP; and G. L. Bacchiega, and I. Gallimberti, 1RS. The main purpose of the experiments described here is the analy- sis of the mechanisms of radome protection with lightning diverters of various types and sizes. A high voltage arrangement and associ- ated diagnostics have been implemented to perform a quantitative study of the inception and propagation mechanisms of the corona and leader discharges that precede the final breakdown. It is shown that ambient humidity plays a significant role on the discharge pro- cess and that the nature of the discharge initiated from the strip is very different depending on the strip type. Segmented strips are more likely to allow energetic discharges to propagate from an inter- nal antenna leading to radome puncture. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2884. New investigations of the mechanisms of light- ning strokes to radomes - Part II: Modeling of the protection efficiency. A. Delannoy, A. Bondiou-Clergerie, P. Lalande, P. Blan- chet, and P. Laroche, Onera; and G. L. Bacchiega, and I. Gallim- berti, 1RS. Experimental studies of the mechanisms of lightning strokes to radome have shown that the protection efficiency can be related to the ability of diverter strips to initiate stable leaders before inception of energetic discharges take place inside the radome. A model based on a 3D code for electric field calculation is used to compute the threshold of these different processes and deduce the optimum strip height for a given internal electrode configuration. The results of this model are successfully compared to experimental estimation of optimum protection. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2885. Effect of lightning currents on structural per- formance of composite material. Diane L. Heidlebaugh, William B. Avery, and Steve T. Uhrich, The Boeing Company. High levels of lightning current through carbon fiber composite material can result in local pyrolization of the resin due to heating of the carbon fibers. The loss of resin in the matrix can liberate the fibers resulting in a reduction or 'knockdown' of structural perfor- 351</page><page sequence="351">2001-01-2885-2001-01-2889 mance. The gas produced during pyrolization can also cause delami- nation of the structural piles, further reducing the structural perfor- mance. Two areas of concern are the direct attachment point and fas- tener locations. To measure the effect of lightning current on structural perfor- mance, two coupon level configurations were employed. One test configuration was a standard, filled hole tension test specimen which had lightning current driven into the protruding head fastener in the center of the part while grounding two edges of the composite material. Different specimens were exposed to four levels of light- ning current and then structurally tested for tensile strength. The results were compared to standard filled hole control samples, to determine the relative effect of the various levels of lightning cur- rent. The second test configuration evaluated the structural perfor- mance of a notched specimen compared to a lightning damaged specimen. An air discharge attachment was made to the center of the test specimen while grounding two edges of the composite mate- rial. The width of the damage caused by the lightning current was comparable to the width of a standard notch used to simulate a crack. The standard notch specimen and the comparable lightning damage specimen were structurally tested and compared to deter- mine the relative effect of lightning damage on carbon fiber com- posite material. 2001-01-2886. A comparison of MAFIA/Microwave Studio calculations with experimental results for indirect lightning effects on carbon composite structures. Claudio G. Parazzoli and Robert B. Gre e gor, The Boeing Company. A study of indirect lightning effects on carbon composite struc- tures with internal tubing is performed using the 'ab initio' Maxwell equation codes MAFIA and Microwave Studio (MWS). The model- ing is performed both in the time and frequency domain by a finite difference method that can accommodate anisotropic media. Both time and frequency domains are used to better reflect the actual test- ing performed on aircraft. Solutions in frequency domain also help to overcome limitations of the time domain calculations. Time cal- culations cannot be performed for pulses longer than 100-200 ps due to the Courant condition and computer time limitations and hence, low frequency resonances of the system could be missed. Three- dimensional frequency domain calculations are available with MAFIA and MWS, while time domain results are available in MAFIA, MWS and EMA3D. The results of the time domain calcu- lations are compared with experiments in the frequency domain by taking the Fourier transforms of the results. The driving current input pulse is given, the currents densities and voltage distribution are computed throughout the entire structure. Boundary conditions are chosen to closely replicate the ones present in the experiment. The current distribution on the external wing skin and internal com- ponents is compared to experimental values. From the computed field distributions the voltages between critical points can be deter- mined to ascertain breakdown conditions. 2001-01-2887. UK military aircraft lightning strike reporting over the last 50 years. Pamela J. Odam , GAO Consultancy. It is a requirement for the British RAF that all lightning strikes are reported and for those since 1972 there is a strike database which is maintained by GAO Consultancy on behalf of QuietiQ (previ- ously DERA) UK (The GAOC Database). This database currently contains 1065 entries which have details of height, weather condi- tions, attitude, damage, effect on crew, etc. In addition to the data- base, there are also two RAE Reports of a further 630 strikes which were notified between 1944 &amp; 1957. Some of those make fascinat- ing reading from a purely historical point but by transferring the information available in these archive records into a format compati- ble with the database reports it has been possible to look for similari- ties and differences between, for example, strike rates per month, height bands, strikes to different aircraft classifications in differing scenarios and resulting damage. The aircraft covered in the databases range from the largest trans- port vehicles through fighters to a small number of helicopters and finally a single unmanned target aircraft, which was of particular interest to the writer as the strike occurred not 10 miles from her home. Possibly one of the most significant factors to come out of the data is the percentage of strikes that occur in 'non-expected lighting condition' that is in clear air, no cloud or precipitation. Examination of these records shows that lightning does not always occur where or when expected as another item of particular interest is the number of strikes that have occurred at a height and temperature where cloud-to-ground lightning would not be expected (above 20,000 ft and at temperatures of -52°) and the fact that every incident at those heights have caused damage. This paper will present trends, examine damage, look for evi- dence of changed strike rates or possible changing weather patterns. There are other, bigger databases but none where the information contained spans over half a century. 2001-01-2888. A review of the severe lightning threat. Dave Tudor , UK-Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA has previously initiated and funded research to assess the lightning threat to helicopters operating in the North Sea. One of the conclusions of this research is that lightning strikes to helicopters operating in the North Sea are more likely to involve positive polarity cloud-to-ground strikes which generally have a higher action integral than the typical negative polarity cloud-to- ground strikes. The UK-CAA is also familiar with a lightning accident to a glider North of London in 1999. One of the conclusions of the investigation into this accident was that the glider had been struck by a lightning strike with a considera- bly greater action integral than the present certification test threat level. EUROCAE WG31 and SAE Committee AE2 have reviewed the above data and other incident/accident reports. The available data on the severe threat is considered limited, the committees therefore requested that further evidence be presented. The EUROCAE WG31 Committee therefore took an action to collate examples of lightning strikes where the damage observed has been reproduced in the test laboratory or has been quantified by other means. These examples have been collated into a database of severe threat incidents. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2889. Continued electromagnetic protection of air- craft and systems. Michelle Cronkleton and Chuck Beuning, Cessna Aircraft Company. Aircraft electromagnetic protection has always been focused on the design, test and analysis required for certifying aircraft. That focus is now expanding to include the continued airworthiness of electromagnetic protection over the entire life of the aircraft. A bet- ter understanding of the scope and magnitude of maintaining assur- ance is needed for continued electromagnetic protection and safety over the lifetime of the aircraft. Wire bundle shielding of aircraft wiring harnesses, electrical bonding, and grounding are all used to provide electromagnetic pro- tection in general aviation aircraft. The effectiveness of these pro- tection methods is assumed to be maintained using periodic detailed visual inspections and DC bond checks after any replacements or repairs. This assumption appears valid because of the low number of catastrophic occurrences involving lightning strikes. However, the continued effectiveness of electromagnetic protection methods becomes more important as the use of and complexity of the Avion- ics used in the aircraft increases. Continued effectiveness of the electromagnetic protection methods is also very important as the amount of composite materials used in the manufacture of the air- craft is increased. 352</page><page sequence="352">2001-01-2890-2001-01-2895 2001-01-2890. Indirect lightning effects evaluation of an F/A- 18E/F. Mike Nahaj , Mike Clelland, Mike Whitaker, and Bruce McClure, Naval Airwarfare Center; and John Schneider , Computer Science and Applications , Inc. The F/A-18É/F aircraft are now being constructed with a skin of largely composite material. With this new configuration, the Navy required that the aircraft be evaluated for lightning vulnerability. The test was performed at the Navy Patuxent (Pax) River (MD) facility during the spring of 2001. The test was conducted in accordance with MIL-STD-464 using the test configuration shown above. Current was pulsed into the air- craft and returned via a unique coaxial return path. The current waveform was produced with a moderate capacitor bank (1.65 pF) discharged with a crowbar switch used to attain the double exponen- tial waveform. A matrix of circuits were evaluated with both flight critical and mission essential systems considered as highest priority test points. The test was conducted with two current path configura- tions. The first path was the normal nose-to-tail path and the second was nose-to- wing, which included the wingtip-mounted AIM-9 mis- sile. The missile was required since it is part of normal aircraft oper- ations. After the impulse test phase, the aircraft systems were then induced with the 'direct drive' current evaluation, which scales to full threat lightning level. The test results are to be used for the eval- uation of the aircraft's lightning vulnerability and will be compared to tests performed on the F/A-18A aircraft at Sandia National Labo- ratories. Data acquisition during the lightning simulation test was automated via a Data Acquisition and Processing System. The sys- tem automatically corrected the waveform information by removing instrumentation-unique characteristics. Noise and field measure- ments assured that the recorded signals were not produced by extra- neous influences. Preliminary results indicated high magnetic fields on the interior of the aircraft due to the composite skin on the bay doors and by the simulated lightning currents being transfer to the aircraft (sub)structure, as expected. Details of the test setup, instru- mentation, aircraft preparation, and test results are presented in this paper. 2001-01-2891. On the modeling of field-to-line coupling inside a lightning struck-aircraft. Maria Sabrina Sarto and Alberto Scarlatti, University of Rome "La Sapienza ' This paper discusses the features of different field-to-line cou- pling simulation models to be used for the transient analysis of the EM-induced effects of the direct lightning interaction with aircraft. The choice of one model is suggested by the quasi-magnetostatic nature of the lightning interaction problems, which generate numeri- cal inaccuracy in the calculation of the electric field solution inside the computational domain. It is demonstrated that the use of the field-to-line coupling model based on the use of the magnetic field components allows to avoid numerical inaccuracy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2892. VAM-LIFE: Virtual aircraft electromagnetic lightning indirect effect evaluation. Valeria Volpi and Maurizio Apra, Alenia Aerospazio; and Marcello D'Amore, Maria Sabrina Sarto, and Alberto Scarlatti, University of Rome "La Sapienza ' The computational tool VAM-LIFE is developed for the com- plete analysis of the EM field distribution inside and outside light- ning struck aircraft and the evaluation of the indirect effects induced in the onboard wiring system. The VAM-LIFE tool is composed by five computational blocks, which allow to merge: the procedure for the definition of the equivalent digital model of the aircraft; the finite-difference time-domain procedure for the calculation of the EM field distribution; the transmission-line nodal-analysis proce- dure in frequency-domain for the calculation of the induced effects. The most relevant aspects of VAM-LIFE are described and numeri- cal applications are shown. The tool is approved by the Italian Aero- nautic Authority for lightning indirect effect certification of the C-27J aircraft. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2893. Indirect lightning prediction codes. Jack Nachamkin and Joseph Brigante, Boeing Philadelphia. Codes have been written that allow designers to predict lightning indirect effects on aircraft wiring and structural elements. As a cost- saving alternative to aircraft level testing, the codes will be used to calculate actual transient levels (ATL) on aircraft wiring with the purpose of verifying system lightning protection certification com- pliance by analysis. The code suite employs a CAD feature to enter the problem geometry. Additional user inputs include electrical characteristics of an airframe, excitation of the airframe with light- ning attachments, and computation and display of the electrical response of any electrical member of the airframe versus time. The time series for an electrical response is calculated using inverse Laplace transforms of pole-zero terms fitted to the spectral response of the chosen element. In all cases tested to date, very few pole-zero terms are needed compared to the number of frequency samples required for the equivalent accuracy using standard Fourier tech- niques. Pole-zero terms are fitted using a specialized least-squares procedure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2894. A comparison of numerical techniques for the study of lightning indirect effects. Barbara Melander, Peter Rim- bey, Don Dabelstein, Frank Lenning, Juang Lin, Claudio Parazzoli, Robert B. Greegor, John Gibbs, and Richard Sojka, The Boeing Company. A comparison of various numerical tools and techniques was per- formed for calculating the lightning indirect effects to composite structures and internal systems. This paper is a summary of the ini- tial comparison results. Detailed results of each technique consid- ered are given in additional separate papers presented during this conference. The modeling considered current distributions over and within composite surfaces and the coupling of current and voltages to internal systems such as wire bundle cables and hydraulic and fuel tubes. The models were compared to each other and to mea- sured data from low-level swept continuous wave (LLCW) tests per- formed on two test fixtures. Other features of the codes such as run time, ease of use, computer requirements, availability of documenta- tion and technical support, etc., are compared as well. The EM analysis techniques that were compared included finite difference time domain (FDTD), finite difference frequency domain (FDFD), wire grid method-of-moments (MOM), boundary element method (BEM), a lumped element transmission line model, and a low-frequency resistive-inductive method-of-moments model (MOM). The codes employed were a combination of Boeing in- house tools and commercially available software. Each code was run modeling two separate test fixtures using similar parameters including dimensions and material electrical properties. The first test fixture consisted of a 3-bladed graphite skin panel with an alu- minum tube running between the blades. The second test fixture was the outboard section of a graphite composite wing-box with various tube and wire runs installed internally. The wing-box also had five apertures on one side. Comparisons of the results between the differ- ent model approaches and between selected test-point measure- ments are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2895. Surges superimposed on continuing currents in lightning discharges. V. A. Rakov, University of Florida. M components are impulsive processes that occur during contin- uing currents following return strokes in both natural and rocket- triggered lightning. Similar impulsive processes occur during the initial stage of rocket-triggered lightning and during the initial stage of upward natural lightning initiated from tall objects. The combina- tion of impulsive and steady current components may represent an additional threat to various objects and systems. For example, M components may impart electrodynamic stresses on metallic struc- tural elements already weakened due to thermal effects of the back- ground continuing current. It is possible that the very large positive 353</page><page sequence="353">2001-01-2895-2001-01-2902 currents measured by K. Berger and co-workers on instrumented towers were associated with M-component-type processes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2896. Small shelters and safety from lightning. Richard Kithil, National Lightning Safety Institute; and Vladimir Rakov , University of Florida. Small open shelters are common on athletic fields, golf courses, parks, roadside picnic areas, schoolyards, and elsewhere. Many of these shelters are built to protect against rain or sun, not lightning. What can be done to minimize risk/maximize safety for people inside them under direct and indirect lightning strike conditions? Although there is no such thing as a lightning-proof small outdoor shelter, a properly designed and installed lightning protection sys- tem may make a difference. Sometimes the difference is between life and death. 2001-01-2897. Influence of the rod height and lightning polarity on the protection zone. S. Grzybowski , Mississippi State University. Presented in this paper is a method to calculate the Franklin rod protection zone, through mathematical equations by considering the Franklin rod height and lightning stroke polarity impacts on striking distance. The method was developed and analyzed for different cases with varied rod heights, and for positive and negative polarity. The calculated results of the protection zone were compared to the laboratory measured outcomes of several protected objects with var- ied heights. 2001-01-2898. Electrical strength of ultra-long air gaps. Vladimir S. Syssoev , Moscow Power Engineering Institute ( Techni- cal ; and Yuri V. Shcherbakov, All-Russian Electrotechnical Insti- tute. Some experimental results on discharge development in ultra- long air gaps (breakdown voltages, parameters of the leader stage) are presented. The obtained data are compared to available data on breakdown of long air gaps under positive switching pulses with critical time-to-crest. Existing empirical and theoretical formulae for calculation of sparkover voltage of rod-to-plane air gaps are reviewed. Electrical strength of ultra-long air gaps is considered based on general analysis of physical processes in leader stage of spark discharge. The electrical strength has been thus expressed in the given paper via some characteristic stabilization electric field for each spatial scale. As predicted here, the electrical strength along the lightning development path may decrease down to 3-flO kV/m. 2001-01-2899. Investigation of corona threshold voltages on International Space Station U.S. Laboratory and Airlock Orbital Replacement Units. Theresa N. Shane, The Boeing Com- pany. Corona discharge phenomenon is an important consideration when qualifying powered Orbital Replacement Units of the Interna- tional Space Station U.S. Laboratory and Airlock elements as elec- tromagnetically compatible. Corona degrades insulating materials and may cause electromagnetic interference. Therefore, it is desir- able that powered Orbital Replacement Units do not produce corona discharge regardless of electrode configuration or ambient on-orbit conditions. For the purpose of space station electromagnetic compatibility verification, determining whether corona will occur is accomplished by comparing the corona onset voltage to the Orbital Replacement Unit operating voltage for a given set of system operating parame- ters. At the corona onset voltage, the potential exceeds the minimum value needed to produce a self-sustaining ionization process. Corona may result if the operating voltage exceeds this threshold voltage. To determine corona onset voltages for cathode-present configu- rations, empirical data is taken from the literature, and Paschen' s Law is used to approximate corona onset theoretically. For cathode- remote configurations, a computer model for burst pulse and contin- uous streamer inception is adapted. Dr. V. Schroeder developed this model to predict corona discharge formation on raindrops. Given space station on-orbit conditions and conductor design requirements, corona discharge is not expected to occur on Orbital Replacement Units of the U.S. Laboratory and Airlock. The lowest corona onset voltage found for cathode-present configurations is approximately equal to 350 Vd.c., while burst pulse initiation for cathode-remote configurations is not expected to occur for voltages lower than approximately equal to 700 Vd.c. The operating voltages, including possible transients, of Orbital Replacement Units aboard the U.S. Laboratory and Airlock do not exceed these values. 2001-01-2900. Use of modeling to design lightning protection on launch vehicle. André Schaffar, Sylvie Fargeot, and Yves Ren- nesson, EADS Launch Vehicles. This paper focuses on advanced electromagnetic computational tools used for designing protection against the indirect lightning effects on launch vehicles. The launcher design has to integrate lightning requirements determined by a lightning risk and risk coupling analysis. Lightning currents couple with the launcher avionics mainly through cables running externally along the booster stages where they are the most exposed. These cables are generally protected by ducts which are made either of conductive or dielectric material. In the last case, if the duct is dielectric, the cable bundles have to be protected by braided o ver shielding. When it is made of aluminium alloy, it is obviously attempting to use the duct itself as overshield- ing. A cable duct is a complex mechanical assembly. Its electromag- netic attenuation is more difficult to control than that of a braided overshielding. In order to provide quick reliable advice, electromagnetic cou- pling of the cable duct bundles is calculated and the duct's electro- magnetic efficiency is quickly characterized. To conclude the analysis, the cable duct definition is corrected in accordance with modeling results. This avoids late hardware changes and thereby cost overshoots and schedule delays. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2901. The development, deployment, and operation of an on-line lightning monitoring system (OLMS) for space- craft launch support. Paolo G. Sechi and Richard C. Adamo , SRI International. The On-Line Lightning Monitoring System (OLMS) is designed to continuously detect and characterize the effects of lightning- induced electromagnetic transients at a number of spacecraft launch sites in the United States. The OLMS uses broadband sensors, installed at a number of preselected locations at the launch site, to simultaneously measure incident electromagnetic fields, as well as energy coupled to conductors, using a unique combination of analog and digital subsystems. The system allows users to assess the elec- tromagnetic threat to sensitive electronic systems aboard spacecraft, thereby retesting systems only if necessary. All data from OLMS is available in real time and can be accessed by authorized users via the Internet using a standard web browser interface. 2001-01-2902. Factors affecting fuel system certification against lightning hazards. G. A. M. Odam, GAO Consultancy UK ; J. R. Tilston, QinetiQ (formerly DERA); and C. C. R. Jones, BAe Systems UK. The certification of fuel systems is an important aspect of the overall certification of an aircraft against lightning hazards and embraces almost all disciplines needed to deal with the lightning interaction. Both direct and indirect effects are encountered and some understanding of the physics of fuel combustion and probabil- ity theory concerning ignition is also necessary to appreciate the fac- tors influencing the safety or otherwise of a design. At one time the Western Air Forces were losing one aircraft every other year, due 354</page><page sequence="354">2001-01-2902-2001-01-2908 to lightning-related fuel explosions. Similar accidents occur to Civilian aircraft, albeit less frequently. After a brief review of air- craft fuels and their flammability and some discussion of combus- tion processes, the paper considers factors affecting Minimum Igni- tion Energy (MIE) encountered during flight profiles, such as oxy- gen enrichment, temperature and pressure. The paper also reviews possible ignition sources, such as hotspots, thermal and voltage sparking, and stresses the need for a rigorous Lightning Hazard Design Analysis (LHDA) as part of the certification process. Areas that should be included in the LHDA are noted. The paper reviews Lightning Standards relating to fuel and notes areas where shortcomings are thought to be present. Mr. Tilston is a Principal Consultant at QinetiQ (formerly DERA) Pyestock with 40 years experience in Combustion and Fuel Technology. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2903. Investigation of lightning indirect effects on a full carbon fiber composite mock-up. Pierre-Nicolas Gineste, EADS-CCR; Franck Flourens^ EADS- AIRBUS; Maurice Can- taloube and Christian Fallot , Centre ď Essais Aeronautiques de Toulouse ; Helmut Zaglauer, Dornier ; Jonas Gustafsson , Ericsson Saab Avionics ; Alan Pout , BAe Systems ; and Wolfang Tauber, Eurocopter Deutschland. In the frame of the European project CATE (Composite and Advanced Aircraft Technologies Electromagnetic Protection), a full CFC mock-up has been designed and manufactured. Both measure- ments and computations have been carried out to investigate and to assess the coupling mechanisms throughout CFC structures. Differ- ent aspects have been covered: effects of apertures, effects of metal- lic devices, effects of protection on cables, ... The understanding of the physical phenomena involved enables the formulation of general rules of protection which can be applied on very large aircraft at lower cost. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2904. A comparison of the prediction of lightning indirect effects using 2-D analytical tools with measured data from two composite test fixtures. Barbara Melander, John Gibbs, and Richard Sojka, The Boeing Company. A comparison was done of the prediction capabilities for light- ning indirect effects of two two-dimensional (2-D) computer codes using two graphite structural test fixtures. The two codes evaluated were an internal Boeing Method-of-Moments code and a commer- cially available Boundary Element method code. The codes were compared against each other and against test data. The purpose was to evaluate the prediction capabilities of both codes for use in pre- dicting lightning indirect effects on internal components of graphite structure. Since 2-D codes are much easier to use than 3-D codes, they could be widely used in trade studies and design evaluations for lightning indirect effects protection of composite aircraft. The first code, REDIST, is a Method-of-Moments code devel- oped in the 1980's for use on the B-2. The REDIST code has short run times and is somewhat easier to use than the second code that was investigated. The second code examined, Oersted, is a Bound- ary Element method code and is commercially available. It has a modern GUI interface and post-processing capabilities but is more difficult to implement and has longer run times. These two codes were compared with each other and with test data for a variety of geometries that simulated two graphite test fixtures with internal metal components. The test data taken was on two structural graphite composite test fixtures. The first was a graphite skin panel segment with 3 blade stiffeners. Low Level Continuous Wave (LLCW) measurements were made of the current on an aluminum tube placed in several locations near the skin and blades to understand the lightning current redistribution in areas such as wing leading edges. The second test fixture was an outboard section of a graphite composite wing box built by Boeing and NASA. Several aluminum tubes were installed to simulate hydraulic and fuel lines or electrical conduits and shields. Again CW measurements of the tube currents were made. These test results are compared with the two code results for various tube locations and modifications to the wingbox. 2001-01-2905. Electromagnetic coupling of a conductor and a composite structure by wire mesh modeling. Juang Lu Lin, The Boeing Company. The electromagnetic coupling between a conductor and a com- posite structure by wire-mesh techniques using method of moments is investigated. A three-bladed composite panel with an aluminum tube located above the panel is considered in this analysis. Compu- tations are made of the current on the tube for various frequencies with height above the panel as a parameter. The numerical results compared reasonably well with the measurements. The technique proves to be useful in modeling the composite structures such as wings of an aircraft. 2001-01-2906. Frequency domain analysis for the prediction of lightning indirect effects and comparison to measured data from two composite test articles. Donald Dabelstein, The Boeing Company. A lightning indirect effects analysis of a conductor over graphite composite structure was performed using a frequency domain analy- sis. An internal Boeing analysis code, EM_Model, was used to pre- dict and model test data from two graphite composite test articles. The first was a simple graphite panel with an aluminum tube placed at various heights above the panel. The aluminum tube is representa- tive of either hydraulic or fuel lines, or cable bundle shields. The second test article was the outboard section of a graphite wing-box with two aluminum tubes internal to the structure. A series of access panels in the wing skin provided a source of aperture coupling in addition to the diffusion currents. Both tests made low-level CW (LLCW) measurements of the tube transfer function and were com- pared to model results with good agreement. 2001-01-2907. Responses of lightning rods to nearby light- ning. Charles B. Moore, Graydon Aulich, and William Rison, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. In an effort to determine the effectiveness of the sharp-tipped lightning rods widely used in the U.S., we carried out a competition between sharp and blunt rods to determine which was preferentially struck by lightning. Over the past eight years, 12 blunt rods partici- pated in cloud-to-ground discharges while none of the nearby rods with sharp tips were struck. Our analysis suggests that the emissions of point discharges from the tips of sharp rods associated with the rapid decrease of the electric field strength around the tips combine to make sharp rods poorer receptors for lightning than are moder- ately blunt rods. 2001-01-2908. Methodology for electromagnetic susceptibil- ity analysis of aerospace ground facilities. J. L. Boulay, J. C. Alliot, J. P. Parmantier, and F. Issac, ONERA. A three years analysis has been carried out inside the scope of the 4th framework program driven by the European Commission. The objectives of this analysis were consisting of the develop- ment of three complementary tools required for the electromagnetic susceptibility analysis of a ground facility. - a new methodology approach based on critical coupling functions evaluation - a test equipment allowing a quantitative determination of these coupling functions - a numerical tool, based on the electromagnetic topology concept (ONERA CRIPTE code), which, by comparison with tests results, gives the evaluation of the full threat susceptibility of critical operational functions and conducts to the definition of pertinent electromagnetic protection to be applied on the ground facility. The definition and the characteristics of the three tools are pres- ented. Experiments conducted on specific ground facilities are described. Results obtained in tests and numerical calculations will be discussed. 355</page><page sequence="355">2001-01-291 1-2001-01-2919 2001-01-2911. Application of the finite difference time domain code EMA3D to the modeling of indirect lightning effects in a composite panel and wing box. Frank E. Lenning and Peter R. Rimbey, The Boeing Company. The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method (as imple- mented in the commercial software package EMA3D) is used to model indirect lightning effects in a composite three-bladed panel and a composite wing-box. The analysis is compared with low-level continuous wave (LLCW) tests performed in the Boeing Lightning Effects Laboratory. Measured data include transfer functions for currents induced on metal tubing interior to the three-bladed-panel and wing-box. The thin wire and thin plate formalisms provided in EMA3D are used to model the composite surfaces and metallic con- ductors such as pipes in the wing-box. The wing-box is simulated both with and without apertures. The modeling results showed excellent agreement with measurements over a broad frequency range demonstrating the usefulness of FDTD as a predictive tool for lightning frequencies. 2001-01-2912. Integral lightning strike protection of CFC fuel tanks on aircraft. Barry Pridham , BAE SYSTEMS ; and Dieter Jaeger and Manfred Schreiner , EADS Germany. The external structure of fast jet aircraft are now often con- structed largely from Carbon Fiber Composites (CFC). Much of the external skins form part of fuel tanks. A lightning strike to a tank skin is likely to cause arcing and sparking at structural joints. This can lead to particles of molten metal or resin being injected into the fuel tanks along with hot gasses which presents a risk of fuel explo- sion. This paper describes lightning strike protection of CFC fuel tanks with emphasis on integral lightning strike protection and the protec- tion of access panels. This integral protection is based on a network of copper strips cobonded into the composite tank shell. The protection details, such as foil thickness and fastener installation details may be varied to suit the lightning strike threat. The details are specified in BAE SYSTEMS patents. 2001-01-2913. Ignition hazards from intermittent electrical contacts. Stephen Haigh and John Percival , Culham ElectroMag- netics and Lightning. For conventional metallic aircraft lightning protection methodol- ogies have generally been well established by years of flight experi- ence. However, recent events have highlighted the need to take into account the effects of age or existing fault conditions. For lightning this could mean currents being conducted across unbonded couplings, across bond straps which make intermittent contact, or by debris or chafed wires bridging to fuel gauges and their wiring. The paper discusses the effects of transient currents flowing through intermittent contacts, and the levels at which such transients present a potential threat for fuel ignition. In the main this is a review of existing data, but supported by experimental studies which are just beginning at Culham. The work has been carried out under the European EM-Haz and the Culham Lightning Club programs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2915.

This paper reports some of the results of a NASA-prototype com- posite wingbox direct drive test, performed in the Boeing Lightning Lab from October 23, 2000 to June 8, 2001. The test data is being used to support computer analysis program and modeling efforts that are researching issues concerned with composite fuel tank designs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2916. Evaluation of current conductivity of compos- ite wiring integrated assembly for use on Bell/Agusta 609 tiltro- tor aircraft. Sayyid A. Nadimi and Larry Frazer, Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. Electrical characteristics of composite Wiring Integrated Assem- bly (WIA) chassis's when subjected to lightning environment are studied. The wiring architecture of the Bell Agusta Tiltrotor civil aircraft designated as Model B A609 includes WIAs that are shielded junction boxes. The WIAs are required to maintain wire bundle shield continuity to ground when exposed to the effects of a light- ning event. Test results demonstrate that the composite WIAs hav- ing copper and nickel plating can withstand lightning currents up to 20 KA. A description of the WIAs, as well as lightning test proce- dure and results using waveforms 5A and 5B are presented. 2001-01-2917. Waveform comparisons between qualification data and aircraft measurements. C. C. R. Jones and Shawn Pow- ell , BAE SYSTEMS; and Joe Gallagher , Consultant. Lightning-induced current and voltage pulses are defined in international standards as arising from three distinct coupling mech- anisms: capacitive, inductive and resistive. These mechanisms at their simplest give rise to distinct characteristics in the induced wave-shapes relative to the lightning current pulse that caused them. It has long been the practice to decide from a particular induced wave-shape, which was the likely induction mechanism, and com- pare it in terms of peak amplitude only with the relevant qualifica- tion test waveform. This approach fails to take account of the fact that almost all induced waveforms are actually a sum of two or all of the coupling mechanisms, that the coupling is not simple but gives rise to much more complex wave-shapes than the qualification standards would imply, and that there are other critical parameters apart from the peak amplitude. It may also disguise the effect of pos- sible building/rig resonances in test results. In this paper, the authors argue that this simple approach is not enough and devise a set of norms encapsulating the properties of current and voltage wave- forms in simple quantities that permit a comprehensive comparison between wave-shapes. The characterization can be done in a stan- dard spreadsheet program provided the two sets of data can be put into a digital form. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2918. A quasi-statistical approach to aircraft induced effects characterization. C. C. R. Jones , BAE SYSTEMS. In order to demonstrate comprehensively for every cable to every flight safety critical equipment on an aircraft, that the qualification test levels were greater by a margin than the levels of induced threat on the aircraft, it is necessary to measure the current or voltage on all of those cables during whole aircraft tests. In this paper, an approach is described which relies on a statistical distribution of induced threat amplitudes in the cables within an airframe to reduce the number of cable measurements needed, and fill in for cables that cannot be measured. The method also offers, for the first time, a via- ble approach to the substantiation of a similarity argument. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2919. ALISDAR: An automatic lightning system detection and recording. P. Lalande , P. Blanchet , and P. Laroche , Onera; P. N. Gineste and B. Basso-Cochard, EADS-CCR ; F. Flourens, EADS- Airbus; and A. Ulmann and P. Dimnet, CEAT. In the framework of an EC (European Community) project EM- HAZ (Electromagnetic Hazard), an Automatic Lightning System Detection And Recording (ALISDAR) has been developed. Electri- cal and magnetic field measurements are the best way to character- ize the lightning strike to aircraft. A finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is used to estimate the lightning current from E and H field measurements. The severity and the location of the lightning strike could be used to optimize the maintenance operations. The best location in terms of cost for the ALISDAR sensors is a dummy 356</page><page sequence="356">2001-01-2919-2001-01-2928 window.

Total lightning characteristics of thunder- storm, contribution to nowcasting applications. Philippe Rich- ard , Vaisala SA; and Igor Kononov , St. Petersburg University. Total lightning data, made of Intra Cloud and Cloud-to-Ground lightning, is an information which is getting more frequently used by National Weather Services and other users around the world in their operational nowcasting applications. This paper presents results of data analysis from the SAFIR system, providing a large- scale quantitative approach in assessing the benefits of Total Light- ning in terms of gain in time for storm early detection and nowcast- ing, and improvement in monitoring capacity for storm mapping and tracking. 2001-01-2921. NFPA-780 (1997) standard for the installation of lightning protection systems: Transitioning from an outdated concept. Richard Kithil, National Lightning Safety Institute. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems is the de facto lightning protection document in the USA. Special interest groups seeking to force scientifically unsubstantiated air terminals into NFPA-780 have coerced under threat of litigation the NFP A Stan- dards Council to withhold the Version 2000 Upgrade of NFPA-780. This present state of paralysis exists despite membership approval of the Version 2000 Upgrade in accord with all the NFP A by-laws. More recently the Standards Council publicized its intent to (per- haps) withdraw NFPA-780 entirely. As a consensus document NFPA-780 represents minimum pro- tection standards and contains some errors and omissions. The pur- pose of this paper is to discuss some of the NFPA-780 (1997) short- comings and to summarize other lightning protection documents already peer-reviewed and in the literature. These alternative light- ning protection guidelines may assist the specifying architect and engineer. 2001-01-2922. Lightning protection: Experimental approach and solutions for large sensitive systems - Example of a nuclear power plant. Daniel Soleil , EMC Engineering; and Alain Alearas , THALES Communications. This document describes the unclassified part of the lightning protection studies for a video control system. The study was held during September 1994 at Cruas Nuclear Power Plant (F-07). Posi- tive improvements were seen immediately and long-term benefits have been reinforced by continued protection. The studies were conducted with a new EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) concept: 'Zero Method.' This concept uses an acces- sible and easy process to control the industrial electromagnetic inter- ference from radio, cellular phones and lightning effects. The adopted solutions improve personnel and facility safety and provide a cost effective solution. 2001-01-2923. Photographic spark detection film sensitivity study. Diane L. Heidlebaugh , John A. Ward, and Dale A. Dodrill, The Boeing Company. Lightning testing performed on fuel tank components or structure utilizes photographic techniques or an explosion test cell to deter- mine tendencies of the hardware to produce sparks. The photo- graphic technique utilizes the no-light-on-film pass/fail criteria with a Polaroid camera at an f-stop of 4.7 and a film speed of 3000 ISO, or a 35 mm camera equivalent. There is speculation that although, per the test specifications, the requirements of the test are met if these film and camera settings are as specified, the various film types would not produce equivalent results. It is common for faster speed films to be grainier which could affect the ability of the film to detect small sparks. There are also color films which, depending on their manufacturer, can have different sensitivities to various light frequencies. The processing of the film can also affect the ability to discern small sparks. Several test methods to evaluate the film sensitivity are employed as part of this study. Thermal spark sources representative of the types of materials typically photographed during laboratory testing, is one of the film sensitivity tests performed. These spark sources consist of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) to CFRP, Titanium-to-Titanium, CFRP to Titanium, CFRP to Alumi- num, and Aluminum to Stainless Steel. Film comparison tests were also conducted using standardized Light Emitting Diode (LED) light sources. The sources provide a constant frequency and constant intensity for comparison of the film types. The light intensity levels are similar to the lower light intensity levels of the thermal spark sources noted above. MacBeth color rendition tests were also per- formed using different brand films to evaluate the film sensitivity and to provide a consistent result that the film processing laboratory could use to evaluate the effect of modifications to the film develop- ment and printing process. 2001-01-2926. Lightning current levels in aircraft fuel system plumbing. Keith E. Crouch, Lightning Technologies, Inc.; and Peter H. Bootsma, Bombardier/deHavilland. Lightning currents passing through fuel system tubing and other conductors in fuel tanks have long been recognized as potential fuel vapor ignition sources. Tests have been conducted on joints, inter- faces, and flexible couplers to verify their ability to conduct light- ning currents without creating ignition hazards. Prior to the work reported here, there has been very little data upon which to select representative current and voltage levels for these tests. Using the worst case data (amplitudes and durations) obtained from tests on a Bombardier Dash 8 Q100 representative wing box fuel system, test levels for internal plumbing components were pro- posed. Using a 6 dB margin on amplitude and a 6 dB margin on duration (2 to 3 times the measured amplitudes and durations for a 12 dB margin overall), the following test levels and waveforms were suggested for testing fuel system components used in this type of medium-sized commuter aircraft: - fuel system components exposed to Zone 3 currents would be subjected to Waveform (WF) 5B cur- rents (as defined in SAE ARP5412) at 375 A - fuel system compo- nents exposed to Zone 2A currents (through a connection to surfaces subject to direct strike attachment) would be subjected to WF 5B currents of 1,100 A - fuel system components designed to prevent induced currents would be subjected to WF 4 voltages of 300 V. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2927.

Airplane level lightning testing is used to verify lightning protec- tion effectiveness of airplane systems. Time domain pulse and fre- quency domain swept-frequency transfer function tests are two acceptable airplane level ground test methods available to the air- craft manufacturer. Although both methods offer an acceptable veri- fication means, both methods pose their own technical challenges. The intent of this paper is to present data collected from lightning pulse and swept-frequency transfer function tests conducted on a 111 airplane, and to compare these tests results. The data collected for this comparison includes several pulse and transfer function 357</page><page sequence="357">2001-01-2928-2001-01-2933 measurements made on flight control wiring routed along the rear spar of the 111 graphite vertical and horizontal stabilizers. The pulse measurement involved injecting 20 kA damped sinusoid pulse into the tip of the stabilizer while measuring the induced voltage on an individual wire within select shielded flight control bundles. The swept-frequency transfer function measurement involved measuring the induced voltage on the flight control wire as a function of the current input at the stabilizer tip over a given frequency range. The time-domain-induced voltage is then computed by multiplying the transfer function by the spectrum of a particular waveform, in this case the damped sinusoidal waveform of the pulse generator, and then taking the inverse Fourier transform of the product. The results of both airplane tests show that the swept-frequency transfer func- tion responses compares favorably with the pulse test responses. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2929. Aircraft lightning strike indirect effects evalu- ation by low level swept CW testing. Olaf Spiller , EADS Airbus GmbH. One of the tasks to show compliance with the relevant require- ments for protection against the effects of lightning on an aircraft is to derive the so-called internal environment. Of the methods available to determine the transfer functions from the specified external lightning environment to the aircraft specific internal envi- ronment, low level swept CW testing offers benefits over the high level or low level pulse injection methods. The paper looks at the way an actual test was conducted on the EADS Airbus Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD) testbed aircraft, a VFW614 model. This aircraft has been heavily modified to fly with an Elec- tronic Flight Control System EFCS. The test is performed to deter- mine the Transient Control Levels (TCL) and establish the Equip- ment Transient Design Levels (ETDL) for the new equipment. 2001-01-2930. Non-linear effects influencing lightning- induced currents and voltages. C. C. R. Jones and D. Row se, BAE SYSTEMS; G. A. M. Odam , GAO Consultancy; and C. Pinchen, QinetiQ (formerly DERA). It is a view held by many, but not all, that whole aircraft testing for measuring levels and waveforms of induced cable currents and voltages should be carried out at moderately high levels of imposed external threat. The reason for this proposal is that there are a num- ber of effects occurring during the passage of a lightning strike that will result in different cable transient amplitudes and wave-shapes, depending upon whether certain current or voltage thresholds are exceeded. These are the so-called non-linear effects. In this paper, we argue that it is neither practicable nor technically correct to attempt to emulate these effects and test at very low injected current levels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2931. Lightning protection design methodology for a very large non-rigid airship. Martin Eberle and Ralf Mar cor des, CargoLifter Development GmbH; Dieter Jaeger, EADS; Rodney A. Perala, Electro Magnetic Applications, Inc.; Andy Plumer, Light- ning Technologies, Inc.; and Harald Schwarz, Brandenburg Techni- cal University. Successful lightning protection design is important for the Car- goLifter CL 160 large non-rigid transport airship. Non-rigid air- ships, like balloons, have few hard structures so alternative means need to be designed to collect and conduct lightning currents. The helium lifting gas ionizes at one-third the field intensity required for air so spark formation in ambient electric fields is more likely to originate inside a helium-filled envelope than in the air outside of it. Protection development is being accomplished by a combination of high voltage strike attachment tests on scale models, and numeri- cal analyses of electric fields. 2001-01-2932. Lightning protection design of a renewable energy hybrid-system without power mains connection. Alexander Kern and Frank Krichel, Aachen University of Applied Sciences (ACUAS); and Klaus-Peter Mueller, Dehn + Soehne GmbH &amp; Co. In the year 2000 a direct lightning strike to the hybrid-system without power mains connection VAT ALI on the Greek island Crete results in the destruction and damage of some mechanical and elec- trical components. The hybrid-system VAT ALI was not lightning protected at that time. The hardware damage costs are approx. 60, 000 ?. The exposed site of the hybrid-system on top of a mountain was and still is the reason for a high risk of lightning strikes. Also in the future further lightning strikes have to be taken into consider- ation. In the paper, a fundamental lightning protection design concept for renewable energy hybrid-systems without power mains connec- tion and protection measures against direct strikes and overvoltages are shown in detail. The design concept was realized exemplarily for the hybrid-system VATALI. The hardware costs for the protec- tion measures were about 15,000 ?. About 50% of the costs are due to protection measures against direct strikes, 50% are due to over- voltage protection. Future extensions, new installations, or modifi- cations have to be included into the lightning protection design con- cept of the hybrid-system. 2001-01-2933. Precipitation-static (P-Static) overview of composite aircraft. Jerry W. Thornell, The Boeing Company. Aircraft charging due to p-static results from two atmospheric conditions: 1) the vehicle's presence in a thunderstorm, and 2) the triboelectric charging (frictional) caused by neutral snow, rain, or dust particle bombardment of the vehicle frontal surface. Both charging mechanisms can lead to p-static interference by the follow- ing mechanisms of charge redistribution: 1) corona discharges from sharp-edged extremities, 2) streamer discharges on dielectric sur- faces, and 3) arc over between electrically isolated or intermittently grounded metallic sections. Corona discharges have spectral energy primarily in the LF through HF region but potentially significant energy levels in the VHF/UHF bands. Streamer noise is caused by charge buildup on non-conductive vehicle frontal areas such as radomes and wind- shields. The spectral energy content of streamer discharges extends beyond the UHF band; but the noise amplitude is low and the poten- tial for RF interference is only a threat if the receive antennas are located close to the streamer discharge source. An aircraft charged or exposed to fields due only to triboelectric charging may develop corona and limited streamering at its extremi- ties, but it will not trigger lightning. A vehicle such as the B-2 with its large effective area is vulnerable to static charging. The B-2 is thus vulnerable to significant surface static discharge damage if the static discharge system is not optimized. These in-service issues for the B-2 underscore the criticality of a comprehensive design approach with composite materials and finishes to minimize static discharge occurrences. Materials can be characterized as insulators, static free, or con- ductor. These are rather broad categories that are defined in terms of ohm/square characteristics. Materials with surface resistivities &gt; 1012 ohm/square are likely to develop electrostatic charges which will not bleed off by themselves due to the high electrical insulating property of the surface. This paper addresses static free materials primarily. Static dissi- pative composites are, in general, composed of conductive materials such as carbon or metallic particles which are distributed within an insulating medium. The conductive elements are randomly distrib- uted throughout the surface as well as in the bulk portion of the material so that a required amount of volume and surface electrical resistivity are realized. This paper will furthermore provide an over- view of material characterization techniques prior to adaptation to a platform and verification techniques after installation. 358</page><page sequence="358">2001-01-2934-2001-01-2945 2001-01-2934. Some studies on fractal geometry of lightning. G. S. Mani, Institute of Armament Technology. Most electromagnetic models used for analysis of lightning assume a straight path for the return stroke in order to keep the com- putations simple. However, many observations have revealed that the return stroke follows a tortuous path. This paper investigates applicability of fractal geometry to lightning return stroke so that the jaggedness of the path can be accounted in the model. The approach involves applying an image-processing algorithm to trace the tortu- ous path and then use box-counting method for obtaining the fractal dimension of the curve. Results indicate fairly good fractal trend for the images of lightning used in the investigation. 2001-01-2935. Design and verification of robust architectures for electronic systems. Richard Hess, Honeywell International Inc.; and Celeste M. Beicastro , NASA Langley Research Center. The advent of the use of digital electronic technology in elec- tronic systems has enabled unprecedented expansion of aircraft sys- tem functionality and evolution of aircraft function automation. As a result, systems incorporating such technology are used to imple- ment aircraft functions that can affect the safe operation of the air- craft. Lightning can be a common cause threat to such systems, causing both hard (damage) and soft (digital upset) faults in digital electronics. Traditionally, redundancy has been used to avoid single point in failures (hard or soft faults) that could cause loss of an air- craft function affecting safe flight and landing. Relative to soft faults, 'rapid' fault clearing has been implemented and evaluated to achieve system soft fault robustness. Analytic and empiric methods are being developed for design and verification of system fault toler- ance robustness. 2001-01-2936. Overview of the systems and airframe failure emulation testing and integration (SAFETI) laboratory at the NASA Langley Research Center. Celeste M. Beicastro, NASA Langley Research Center. Validation of interconnected complex integrated systems per- forming critical and non-critical flight functions in adverse operat- ing environments is essential to demonstrating compliance to certifi- cation requirements. The Systems and Airframe Failure Emulation, Testing, and Integration (SAFETI) Laboratory is being established to develop advanced experimental validation methods for such sys- tems. The SAFETI Lab provides a forum to conduct extensive hard- ware-in-the-loop testing under a variety of faults, failures, and adverse environmental conditions (including electromagnetic effects due to lightning and High Intensity Radiated Fields) while operating in closed-loop with a computer simulation of the aircraft, sensors, actuators, and engines in flight with atmospheric condi- tions. SAFETI Lab experimental methods address (i) closed-loop operation of the system under test during a flight profile including mode switching, (ii) real-time dynamic detection of controller mal- functions that occur due to the effects of electromagnetic distur- bances, and (iii) the resulting effects on the aircraft relative to the stage of flight, flight conditions, and required operational perfor- mance. This paper provides a description of current and planned capabilities of the NASA Langley SAFETI Lab. 2001-01-2937. Rapid soft fault recovery. Richard Hess, Honey- well International Inc.; and Mahyar Malekpour, NASA Langley Research Center. Empirical and analytic simulation studies of 'rapid recov- ery'from soft faults have been activities, at the Langley Research Center (LaRC) at NASA, supporting the evolution of a systems inte- gration facility where failure emulation testing could be performed (particularly on digital electronic technology-based systems). In the relatively recent past, the closed-loop performance of a Rapid Recoverable Computer (RRC) was studied. This computer, which hosted an autoland control law application program, together with a personal computer running a model (aero characteristics, sensors and actuators) of the B737 airplane, is identified as the Recoverable Computer System (RCS). The performance of the RCS rollback scheme for recovery from soft faults in ideal conditions, as well as in harsh Electromagnetic Environment (EME) conditions (possibly induced by lightning EME, etc.) was assessed. An RCS character- ization study was performed using 1) an existing MATLAB SIMULINK model of the B737 autoland control law augmented with capability to simulate fault injection, as well as recovery meth- ods, 2) a software package running on a PC to handle the communi- cation of data and commands between the RCS and the flight simu- lation, and 3) empirical tests in the EME test facility. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2938. Analytical tools for the design and verification of safety critical control systems. Oscar R. González , W. Steven Gray, and Arturo Tejada, Old Dominion University. Safety critical real-time computer systems such as digital fly-by- wire aircraft are designed to be highly reliable, able to detect and recover from faults, and fail in a safe state even in harsh environ- ments. This paper presents an analytical tool that is being developed to enhance the design and verification of safety critical systems. The tool is used to analyze the effect of standard error recovery systems on closed-loop flight control systems. In particular, this paper devel- ops models and analyzes the stability effect of error recovery roll- back, reset, and restart systems in digital control systems due to sys- tem functional upsets induced by multiple burst waveforms (MBW's) during a lightning flash. A simple example will be used to illustrate one use for the tool: comparison of different recovery methodologies by determining the minimum interarrivai spacing between MBW's to maintain closed-loop stability. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2939. Integration of multiconductor cable codes with three-dimensional time domain finite difference electromagnetic solvers. Gregory J. Rigden, Electro Magnetic Applications, Inc. Modeling of complex electromagnetic interactions often requires the adaptation and merging of several types of analysis tools. This is often a consequence of the inefficiency or limitation of validity in applying a single technique to the problem of interest. A general configuration requiring such an adaptation or merging is one com- prising complex multi-conductor cable harnesses in regions contain- ing other scattering objects. Such objects can significantly impact the field topology driving the harness. A time domain finite differ- ence solver of Maxwell's equations (3D solver) is an effective tool for computing the electromagnetic fields. However, limited com- puter resources often prohibit the resolving of the harness within the finite difference code let alone difficulties in techniques of incorpo- rating complex circuit terminations on individual harness conduc- tors. The merging of a finite difference code with a multi-conductor cable harness code would be an effective tool for calculating responses of this type of configuration. The problem of merging is complicated by the criteria that the multi-conductor cable harness need not be limited in cross-sectional dimensions relative to the respective 3D solver mesh. The harness diameter may be signifi- cantly less than the mesh size or expand over many three- dimensional cells making the harness at least partially resolvable (terminations excluded) by the 3D solver. The objective of the effort for this task was to derive an easily implemented, strongly coupled, self-consistent technique of merging a harness code with a 3D solver resulting in a combined hybrid tool. The excitation of the harness was consistent with transmission line assumptions and the conduc- tors within the harness possessed a variety of terminations. The technique was applied to a number of configurations and proven accurate. 2001-01-2945. Active separation control: From basic research to a simplified high-lift system. Avi Seifert, Tel Aviv Univ. 359</page><page sequence="359">2001-01-2945-2001-01-2952 Active séparation control, using periodic excitation, was studied experimentally at high Reynolds numbers. Previous tests conducted at chord Reynolds numbers as high as 40 x 106 demonstrated that periodic flow excitation can effectively delay flow separation from, and reattach separated flow to airfoils at flight conditions. This review concentrates on results obtained over a generic configuration at high Reynolds numbers. The effective frequencies generate one to four vortices over the controlled region at all times, regardless of the Reynolds number. The vortices are initially amplified by the separated shear-layer, and after initiating reattachment, the strength of the vortices decay as they are convected downstream. Large amplitude, low frequency vortices break down to smaller ones upon introduction at the excitation slot. The effects of steady mass trans- fer were compared to those of periodic excitation. It was found that steady blowing is significantly inferior to periodic excitation in terms of performance benefits and that the response to steady blow- ing is abrupt, and therefore undesirable from a control point of view. Steady suction and periodic excitation are comparable in effective- ness and both exhibit a gradual response to changes in the magni- tude of the control input. The combination of weak steady suction and periodic excitation is extremely effective while the addition of steady blowing could be detrimental. Several performance benefits could be gained by applying the method to existing configurations, but it is expected that the full potential of the method can only be realized through the design of new configuration. A comprehensive, fully turbulent, database was generated in order to guide the devel- opment, and enable validation, of candidate unsteady CFD design tools. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2946. Control of aerodynamic characteristics of air- foils and wing systems in subsonic flow. S. B. Svirschevski, L. G. Artamonova, A. N. Radzig, and N. V. Semenchikov, Moscow State Aviation Institute ( Technical University). The results of experimental investigations of control of compos- ite separation- vortical flows and aerodynamic characteristics of lift- ing units ((i) symmetric and asymmetric airfoils, (ii) wings, (iii) wing systems) at low and high angles of attack are discussed. The control was performed by means of the spanwise baffles mounted on the leeward side of airfoils and wings, and also on the base of useful interaction of vortical structures of a wing system. The inves- tigations are carried out in three subsonic wind tunnels of MAI at free-stream velocities V-infinity = 30.82-47 m/sec and Reynolds numbers Reri = 0.86*106-2.2*106 based on the reference length rl = 1 m. The tests of the airfoil sections are performed in the range of angles of attack from 0° up to 26°. The wings and the wing systems were tested at the angles of attack from -4° to +45°. It was found, that the mounted baffles result in formation of the attached circulat- ing regions to airfoil with dropping pressure and the inspected flow separation. These phenomena promote the increase of the airfoil lift and can be used as effective means of control of its aerodynamic characteristics. It was shown, that the installation of two spanwise baffles on the consoles allowed organizing vortex trapping on the upper surface of a wing. These high-lift devices permit to increase the critical angle of attack of such wing, its lift and also to reduce wing drag at high angles of attack. It is established the possibility to use interaction effects of vortical structures in wing systems for increase of lifting properties at high angles of attack and reduction of pressure oscillations on streamlined surfaces. These effects are the important factor for lowering of acoustic loads on airframe units and downturn of a level of aircraft buffering. 2001-01-2949. On-line maintenance resource management training: The SMART Center. Terrell N. Chandler , Galaxy Scien- tific Corp.; John Schmidt, Naval Safety Center; and Robert Figlock, Naval Postgraduate School. This paper gives an overview and summary of two projects con- ducted over the past two years. The first project hosted a Web-based Maintenance Resource Management (MRM) Seminar on the Safe Maintenance in Aviation Readiness and Training (SMART) Center for FLSW personnel in the Fall of 1999. The SMART Center uti- lizes the technical capabilities of the World Wide Web to provide resources and training for the continuing education of aviation main- tenance personnel. The second project analyzed and tested the DoD- sponsored Advanced Distributed Learning Sharable Content Object Reference Model (ADL SCORM) specification using the SMART Center as the basis for the analysis and testing of the specification. The Naval Postgraduate School in conjunction with the Naval Safety Center is currently conducting an evaluation of the new ADL SMART Center. The results of that evaluation will be presented dur- ing the World Aviation Congress conference. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2950. Distributed maintenance error information, investigation and intervention. George Zolla, Tony Boex, Pat Flander, Doug Nelson, and Scott Tufts, Naval Postgraduate School ; and John K. Schmidt, Naval Safety Center. This paper describes a safety information management system designed to capture maintenance factors that contribute to aircraft mishaps. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System- Maintenance Extension (HFACS-ME), an effective framework for classifying and analyzing maintenance errors that lead to mishaps, incidents, and personal injuries, is the theoretical foundation. An existing desktop mishap application is updated, a prototype web- based model is developed, and an Asynchronous Distributed Learn- ing (ADL) module is conceptualized. These tools facilitate data col- lection, organization, query, analysis, and the reporting of mainte- nance errors that contribute to aviation mishaps. Together they rep- resent a complete, robust system for analyzing aircraft maintenance mishap related factors anywhere at anytime. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2951. The role of standardization on the journey to 'plug &amp; play' weapons. Keith A. Rigby, BAE SYSTEMS. From the earliest days of guided weapons, weapon designers have defined their interfaces to optimize the requirements against technologies that have been available. This has led to a plethora of different interfacing systems existing on today's aircraft. Standards such as Mil-Std-1760 have sought with some success to reduce the number and variation of interfaces and thereby improve interopera- bility of different weapons across many platforms. The recent stan- dardization efforts are now realizing benefits by simplifying the activities required to integrate new weapons. This has a direct impact on reducing integration programs and therefore, the costs of integrating new weapons that have such standard interfaces. But what of the future? The ultimate aim is to evolve towards a 'Plug and Play' concept for weapons integration. This paper reviews the background of weapons integration stan- dardization and discusses the role of standards on the journey to future 'Plug and Play' weapons. 2001-01-2952. Development of a standardized electrical interface for miniature munitions. Jerry Provenza, Air Force Research Laboratory; and Fred Benedick, WINTEC, Inc. A new family of miniature precision guided munitions (stores) intended for airborne delivery is entering development. Companion advanced dispensers will provide for carriage of a number of these munitions at a single aircraft weapon station. The dispensers will adapt a single existing aircraft/store electrical interface to multiple miniature munition electrical interfaces, which will facilitate pre- release initialization and monitoring of the munitions. Due to unique factors associated with this new class of stores including small size, low release force requirements, and stringent cost goals, a new approach to electrical interfacing is required. This paper describes an internationally supported effort to develop a common open sys- tem interface for this application. 360</page><page sequence="360">2001-01-2953-2001-01-2963 2001-01-2953. Common Launch Acceptability Region Task Group. David Clark , Boeing Co.; Alan Faust , Northrop Grumman Systems Corp.; and Alan Jones , Boeing Co. This paper presents a brief overview of the Common Launch Acceptability Region Approach (CLARA) problem and the history of efforts within the Air Force and SAE to address it. An SAE Task Group has produced top level requirements and a proposed CLAR Methodology consisting of three components (Truth Model, Coeffi- cient Generator and LAR Generator) that provides a solution to the multiple LAR implementation problem. This proposed CLAR meth- odology fulfills the key requirement of a LAR algorithm that is to be common to all applications and allows updates via tables of coef- ficients requiring the validation of only those coefficients and not the algorithm. This paper also presents the status of trade studies being conducted by the CLARA TG on mathematical algorithms required to implement the methodology. A key step in these trade studies is development of the appropriate metrics and analysis tools with which to judge alternative algorithms. 2001-01-2954. The generic aircraft-store interface frame- work. Douglas A. Gregory , General Dynamics. This paper announces the intention of the SAE AS-1 Committee to standardize on a common framework for modeling and defining aircraft-store logical interfaces, called GASIF. The paper then advo- cates a common framework that might serve as a suitable starting point for this project. The purpose of GASIF is to foster greater interoperability between aircraft and stores through coordinated standards development and programs. FIELD OF APPLICATION - The field of application for this paper is military aircraft/store avionics, where a 'store' may be defined as any in-flight separable device (such as an air-launched weapon) that when loaded on an aircraft allows it to perform a spe- cific mission. 2001-01-2955. Aerospace education in Germany. Boris Laschka and Albert Pernpeintner, TU Muenchen. The present review examines the procedures of aerospace engi- neering education in Germany. It emphasizes on university- and Fachhochschule-based undergraduate and graduate education lead- ing to a national professional engineering certification. The major focus lies on the requirements for obtaining those degrees. Relevant secondary school preparation necessary for admission is also described. As an example, a typical university program is shown through the aerospace engineering curriculum of the TU Muenchen' s faculty of mechanical engineering. Furthermore the research environment of German universities is described. Finally, the involvement in international university networks, such as the European and transat- lantic cooperation programs, is shown. 2001-01-2957. French aerospace education. Alain Carrere, Ecole Nationale Supérieure de V Aéronautique et de V Espace. To respond to the needs of the French and European Aerospace Industry, France has developed a lot of training in Aeronautics and space at all education levels from Baccalauréat level to Doctorate Level. The higher level is done in a special system of French 'Grande Ecole' for Engineers. The four 'Grandes Ecoles' specialized in Aeronautics have set up an Association called GEA and have partic- ipated in the foundation of the European Aerospace Network of Uni- versities called PEGASUS. 2001-01-2958.

To cope with the effects of the increasing co-operation of and mergers between the European Aerospace Industry and Research Institutes in recent years, the Academic Institutes in Aerospace Engineering Education in Europe are in the process of further strengthening their cooperation and exchange programs. Further- more post-graduate and post-experience programs are being devel- oped together with the industry. The European Commission sup- ported this process as part of the unification of Europe in general. Aerospace Engineering has played an important role in this process. The present paper gives an overview of a number of these co- operative projects. 2001-01-2959. System framework for university-industry aerospace research collaboration. S. Kainikara, R. Kusumo, A.

Worldwide bud- get and resource constraints have adversely affected the program's research and development activities. Aerospace research and devel- opment at university and industry needs to be optimally collaborated to address the new environment of aerospace programs. In this paper a system framework is developed to establish an order in university- industry research collaboration. 2001-01-2960. Spatially integrated depiction of dynamic tra- jectories. E. Theunissen and R. M. Rademaker, Delft University of Technology. Synthetic vision displays often include a spatially integrated depiction of the planned path. Such a depiction is derived from a set of 3-D waypoints. In situations such as a take-off or a go-around, the optimal vertical profile depends on the energy state of the air- craft, and a precomputed path based on planned waypoints cannot be used. This paper discusses the concept of dynamic trajectories, in which some of the dimensions of the path are made a function of the actual aircraft state. Four potential applications of dynamic trajectories are discussed. The functionality required for these appli- cations has been integrated into a prototype synthetic vision system. Initial evaluations have been performed in a fixed-based simulator. 2001-01-2962. A new concept in aircraft undercarriages (reduction of longitudinal impact force). Koji Yoshioka, SUS21 Company Inc.; and Akira Sone, Kyoto Institute of Technology. The author proposes a new principle of suspension system. First, a new shock isolation method prevents sudden sharp jolts and enables a body to continue in motion as before, by transforming lin- ear motion into circular motion. This method reduces abrupt decel- eration and impact force. Next, we examined the gravity spring action of a pendulum as a new vibration isolation method. Because the pendulum generates longitudinal vibration, it has isolation effect against the longitudinal vibration input. Application of this new principle to aircrafts, automobiles, motorcycles, and even to bicycles and wheelchairs, overcomes the limitations of current technology. This study focused on two as-yet- unresolved safety problems of aircraft undercarriages. One is accel- eration impact on the wheels; the other is collision with an obstacle on the runway. The moment the wheel contacts the runway at high speed, hori- zontal linear motion of the wheel is transformed to circular motion, moderating sudden change in horizontal velocity. Controlling gener- ation of acceleration impact thus reduces tire smoking and excessive wear. Meanwhile, if the wheel strikes an object lying on the runway while rolling at high speed, longitudinal spring action of the suspen- sion swings the wheel rearward as it passes over the obstacle. The impact force is reduced, substantially reducing the danger of tire rupture. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2963.

Colman, Rolls-Royce Corp. 361</page><page sequence="361">2001-01-2963-2001-01-2976 A vast array of signal analysis techniques have been developed over the years to aid in the analysis of vibration, stress wave and other raw sensor output signals. These techniques address the infor- mation extraction challenge using many widely varied approaches. With the large variety that exists, determining which solution best fits a given set of requirements can be an expensive and time- consuming process. This process usually includes a large amount of testing to develop the data sets needed to form a common basis for comparison. Presented within this paper is an organized approach to the col- lection and cataloging of signal data sets for the express purpose of providing a common basis of comparison, which would greatly sim- plify the technique evaluation and comparison effort. 2001-01-2965. Advanced real-time aerodynamic model iden- tification technique. Kenneth Hui, Carl Swail, and Barrie Leach , National Research Council Canada. The Flight Research Laboratory (FRL), National Research Coun- cil (NRC) of Canada is currently developing an in-flight aircraft aerodynamic model identification technique that determines the small perturbation model at a given test condition. Initial demonstra- tions have been carried out using the NRC Falcon 20 research air- craft. An efficient system architecture, in terms of both software algorithms and hardware processing, has been designed to meet the stringent near real-time requirements of an in-flight system. As well, novel hardware and software techniques are being applied to the cal- ibration and measurement of the fundamental in-flight parameters, such as air data. The small perturbation models are then combined to develop a global model of the aircraft that is validated by compar- ing the model response to flight data. The maneuvers were per- formed according to the FAA Acceptance Test Guide (ATG). In- flight model development and validation is an innovative applica- tion of parameter estimation. Flight testing of the parameter estima- tion system resulted in a model that matches the Falcon 20 aircraft very well. The longitudinal and lateral derivatives were computed within 2 and 8 seconds, respectively, of completion of the flight test maneuver. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2972. Development and testing of a commercial tur- bofan engine for high altitude UAV applications. Maurice Wein- berg and John Wyżykowski , Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada Corp. A High Altitude Test Program has been recently completed by Pratt &amp; Whitney in conjunction with NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and MTU (Motoren-und Turbinen- Union, München GmbH) to test an instrumented, 'off-the-shelf,' commercial turbofan engine to altitudes &gt;65,000 ft for suitability for high altitude applications. The two-phase test program has been conducted at the Propul- sion Systems Laboratory of the Glenn Research Center in Cleve- land, Ohio. The 1st phase (Aug '99) investigated the basic perfor- mance and operability characteristics in order to identify any short- comings. The 2nd phase (May '01) investigated the response to inlet distortion and high power off-takes, and included extensive steady state and transient instrumentation in the low pressure turbine for the correlation of analytical predictions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2974. Fluoroelastomer compatibility with advanced jet engine oils. Eric W. Thomas , DuPont Dow Elastomers L.L.C. Prevailing trends in aircraft turbine engine applications are push- ing current elastomeric seal materials to their limits. These trends include the continued drive towards more powerful, lighter weight engines, with accompanying reductions in noise, emissions and fuel consumption, as well as ongoing improvements in reliability, main- tainability, and longer intervals between engine overhauls. These trends converge to push engine thermodynamics to their limits, which manifests in higher operating and soakback temperatures. As a result, engine manufacturers specify high temperature stabilized (HTS) oils in order to achieve engine performance and life targets. Aircraft engine lubricants have had to keep pace with higher operating temperatures while still meeting stringent performance requirements and regulatory and environmental compliance. The demands on lubricant manufacturers include improved thermal oxi- dative stability, load carrying capability, reductions in vapor phase coking, and environmentally friendly additive systems. In order for oils to be stable at higher temperatures, different and more aggres- sive base stocks are often used in conjunction with sophisticated packages of surfactants and amine-based stabilizers. It is primarily the additive packages that challenge traditional fluoroelastomers to maintain long life, leak-free sealing performance. In this paper the compatibility of various fluoroelastomers with commercial jet engine oils will be reviewed. Fluoroelastomers that have historically been used in aerospace sealing applications will be compared to several specialty types. Properties relevant to sealing devices and applications will be discussed. Laboratory testing will characterize physical properties and property retention in jet oil through 1500 hours at 200°C. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2975.

The US Air Force (USAF) has evolved a policy for the acquisi- tion of fighter jet engines (FJE). In the 1970s and 1980s that policy placed a premium on FJE performance primarily measured by the metric: thrust/engine weight. In the 1990s, the USAF policy changed from an emphasis on performance to reduced life-cycle cost with a premium on sustainment. This paper reports the results of a study of how the USAF and Corporation Alpha (Alpha) have adapted their processes, practices, and policies to design, develop, manufacture, test, and sustain a family of FJEs. Each member of the family of FJEs is sequentially linked relative to insertion of technol- ogy designed to reduce sustainment costs. In addition to the technology linkages, the development of the family of FJEs selected for this case study is also tracked relative to US Department of Defense and USAF policy and industry design, build, and maintain processes, methods, and tools. This paper dis- cerns the complex, highly integrated manner that characterizes the interaction between (1) technology, (2) policy, and (3) manufactur- ing and sustainment tools to produce a family of FJEs with improv- ing sustainment qualities and non-degrading performance. The metric Unscheduled Engine Removals (UER) per 1000 Effective Flight Hours (UER/1000EFH) is used to compare the sustainability of each member of the selected family of FJEs. Our results are based on data obtained through a series of field inter- views of USAF and civilian government personnel and Alpha per- sonnel. The US government extensive database containing UER information is the primary source of MRO trends for the FJEs of this study. Our analysis shows that the family of FJEs sustainability, as measured by the UER metric, has not improved beyond IO6 EFH for each succeeding generation in the selected FJE family. We conjec- ture that upstream policy, technology insertion, and manufacturing and sustainment tools are not the primary determinants of sustaina- bility; the manner in which the FJE is used has the greatest influence on sustainability of FJEs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2976. Assessment of the OVERFLOW Navier Stokes code for various airplane components. Dinesh A. Naik and Dee- pak Om, Boeing Co. The OVERFLOW chimera grid Navier Stokes code was used to analyze a wide variety of airplane configurations. The code per- formed reliably and was found to have comparable accuracy to the structured grid code TLNS3D. It is easier to develop overlapping grid blocks to represent a complex configuration than it is to develop grid blocks that must abut one another. The process is inherently modular. One can add or subtract components like tip-lights, com- 362</page><page sequence="362">200 1 -0 1 -2976-200 1 -0 1 -2988 pound winglets, struts, nacelles, tails and fairings at will. The gain in grid simplicity is offset by the complication in specifying block connectivity, however. The overset blocks are typically of better quality, but there is a drawback in that it is not always possible to guarantee flux conservation. The recent development of software for automatic connectivity holds promise for the routine use of OVER- FLOW by design engineers. 2001-01-2977. Calculation of incompressible viscous flows by a viscous-inviscid splitting method. Jichao Su, National Research Council of Canada. A viscous-inviscid splitting method is developed to simulate two-dimensional incompressible external flows. The outer inviscid solution is dealt with by solving the potential flow using a finite ele- ment method while the inner viscous solution is obtained by solving the Navier-Stokes equations also by a finite element method. The motivation of developing this approach is to take full advantage of the physical nature of the flow around aircraft where in most cases, the viscous effects are substantial only in the region very close to the aircraft surface. Some preliminary results are presented for the two-dimensional flow around a NACA0012 airfoil to show the effi- ciency and accuracy of the method. 2001-01-2978. Influence of wing-tip dihedral and planform on induced drag. Patrick Bourdin, ONERA. The wing planform as well as the wing frontal shape are numeri- cally investigated with regard to the lift-induced drag reduction. Euler computations have been performed and then post-processed with a far field analysis method for accurate drag predictions. Con- cerning non-planar wings, this paper provides an unusual way to examine their effects on lift-induced drag by comparing them at the same 'deployed' span. Here, deployed span is to be understood as the total curved length of a non-planar wing viewed in its front plane. Far field analysis results show that non-planar wings experi- ence some greater drag at a given lift than planar wings of the same deployed span, even after an optimization process with respect to the lift distribution. Concerning the wing planform influence and especially the crescent shape, another parametric numerical study is presented. Far field results state that moderate drag savings could be obtained with these aft swept wing-tips. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2979. GIS dynamic display for helicopter collision avoidance system. Chin E. Lin and Shih-Che Hung, National Cheng Kung Univ. Helicopter collision avoidance system (HCAS) is implemented under geodetic information system (GIS) environment for display. The conflict avoidance algorithm can be effective if the global sys- tem for mobile communication (GSM)-based automatic dependent surveillance (ADS) can provide sufficient data communication sup- port. In this paper, the implementations of HCAS for the ground control station and for the airborne avionics are presented. Espe- cially, the airborne display to suitable for pilots is concerned with real-time solution. The airborne data of position and heading are fed into GIS mapping for flight situation awareness to all participating pilots and air traffic controllers. A route map is generated following a flight plan. Map rotation of airborne display based on each grid map center is proposed and implemented to offer pilots a good visual effect. This paper presents the overall conceptual verification of the proposed HCAS for practical applications. 2001-01-2980. Towards intelligent control systems for com- mercial aircraft. Fabrice Villaume, LAAS du CNRS and AIRBUS France ; Pierre Fabre, AIRBUS France; and Felix Mora-Camino, LAAS du CNRS and Ecole Nationale de V Aviation Civile (EN AC). The main challenges faced by civil aircraft manufacturers are recalled and the opportunity to use 'intelligent techniques' in the design of control and guidance systems in order to propose to air- lines more and more competitive airplanes is discussed. To illustrate this thesis, the present communication quotes different applications and more particularly displays results concerning the development of an intelligent longitudinal guidance law for time-optimal speed control during the rollout phase of wide body civil transportation aircraft. 2001-01-2981. An ergonomie concept for take-off perfor- mance monitor design. David Zammit-Mangion, University of Malta; and Martin Eshelby, Cranfield Univ. A take-off performance monitor is intended to provide timely indication of whether the take-off attempt is progressing in a satis- factory manner or otherwise to the crew. Envisaged as a non- executive instrument, it is critical that the system be ergonomie by design, thus ensuring optimal exploitation of the intended benefits of improved safety. This effectively requires the instrument to gen- erate a correct measure of performance and to present it in an appro- priate manner to the crew. The paper addresses some of the critical issues in this respect and presents the design concept developed at the Cranfield University's College of Aeronautics. 2001-01-2982. On-line aircraft stability derivatives estima- tion. Kouamana Bousson, University of Beira Interior ; and Pedro Paglione, Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica. Aircraft stability derivative estimation provides a framework for flight control systems design and improvement from their imple- mentation to their operation lifetime. Estimating such parameters on-line has a special interest in establishing the accuracy of airborne simulations and enhancing the adaptive flight control systems. The present paper proposes an on-line estimation method based on a nonlinear flight model. The temporal axis is subdivided according to equidistant temporal landmarks, and the parameter estimation is done at the end of such subintervals with the measurements per- formed on the system during the corresponding subinterval. The optimization approach underlying the estimation method is based on a cyclical optimization along coordinate axes, a derivative-free tech- nique that has shown to outperform standard derivative-free optim- ization algorithms. Simulations related to a modern transport aircraft demonstrate that the proposed method is an accurate stability deriva- tive estimator for nonlinear flight models. 2001-01-2985. Airplane technologies to reduce jet fuel use. David L. Daggett and Gerhard E. Seidel, Boeing Commercial Air- plane Group ; Robert McKinley, NASA Langley Research Center ; and Robert Plencner, NASA Glenn Research Center. The commercial airplane designer is faced with the challenge of balancing many factors to achieve an optimal airplane design, namely, how to reduce jet fuel use while also maintaining or improving emissions, noise, cruise speed, operating cost, range, reli- ability, maintainability, payload, takeoff field length, initial cruise altitude, and landing speed. Often, fuel efficiency improvements run counter to other design constraints imposed on the aircraft manufac- turer by market forces. However, emerging engine and airframe technologies will help to continue the historical trend towards reduced fuel use. Five concept airplane designs will be reviewed that use future technology to enable the design of more environmentally friendly airplanes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2988. Analytical and numerical modeling of the turn maneuver of agricultural aircraft. Bosko Rasuo, University of Belgrade. In this paper a theoretical study of the turn maneuver of an agri- cultural aircraft is presented. The maneuver with changeably alti- tude is analyzed. The effect of load factors on the turn maneuver characteristics during the field-treating flights are analyzed. The mathematical model which describes the procedure of the correct climb and descent turn maneuver are used. For a typical agri- cultural aircraft numerical results and limitations of the climb, hori- zontal and descent turn maneuver are given. 363</page><page sequence="363">2001-01-2988-2001-01-3000 The problem of climb turning flight is described with the system of differential equations which describe the influence of normal and tangential load factors on derivation velocity, the path angle in the vertical plane and the rate of turn in function of the bank angle dur- ing turning flight. The system of differential equations of motion are solved on a personal computer with Runge-Kutta-Merson numerical method. Some results of this calculation in this paper are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2989. 737-800 winglet integration. Paul Dees , Boeing Commercial Airplanes; and Michael Stowell, Aviation Partners Boeing. A joint venture called Aviation Partners Boeing successfully integrated winglets into the Next-Generation 737-800 by retaining performance improvements with minimal weight penalty on the existing 737 wing design. Program challenges included developing both retrofit and production configurations using a common winglet design, causing minimal impact on all customers, and causing mini- mal disruption to the 737 production process. Winglet benefits along with improved performance include reduced engine wear and enhanced visual appeal. 2001-01-2990. Experimental and computational modeling of the aerodynamics of a racecar. Robert E. Atkinson and Kamran Rokhsaz , Wichita State Univ. The aerodynamics of a typical Le Mans configuration is investi- gated numerically and experimentally. The purpose of the investiga- tion has been to gain a better understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics of such configurations in extreme off-design condi- tions. Computational modeling is performed with a low-order panel method, while flow visualization is accomplished with dye injection in a water tunnel using a 1/24-scale model. At low angles of attack, excellent agreement is shown between the streamline patterns observed experimentally and those predicted computationally, despite the large differences in Reynolds numbers. Experimental results indicate presence of attached boundary layers over a large part of the car at very high angles of attack. Furthermore, strong vor- tical structures are detected around sharp edges of lower part of the car at these extreme attitudes. It is postulated that these flow charac- teristics assist the catastrophic departure of these vehicles once they separate from the track. 2001-01-2991. A new airfoil optimized for light aircraft per- formance. Paul Dees , Boeing Commercial Airplanes. A new low Reynolds number, natural laminar flow airfoil design and its impact on performance of a generic light sailplane are pres- ented. Several previously published airfoils, the Liebeck/Camacho LA203A and the Somers/Maughmer SM701, were used as a starting point. They are examined along with several new attempts to further the state of the art for natural laminar flow, single element airfoils. The computational tool XFOIL was used to analyze these airfoils, and the resulting data were adjusted and applied to a generic Sport- ing Class sailplane design. The results indicated that overall perfor- mance improvements are possible over the SM701, the LA203A, and a third reference airfoil. 2001-01-2992. FTE and pilot workload comparison of per- spective flight guidance displays to conventional flight director symbology in instrument approach applications. Robert Ryan Wilkins, Jr., Boeing. Perspective Flightpath Guidance (PFG) Current requirements for precision air navigation are no longer in nautical miles, but tenths of miles as reflected in the RNP3 (Required Navigation Performance) or Required Navigation Perfor- mance (desired flight path) of .3 NM (± .n nmi). Right director guidance for critical maneuvers (those maneuvers with very small or reduced margins for error) is essential for preci- sion navigation requirements. Current generations of guidance sym- bology (Delta- Veebar and Two-bar) work well, but are limited in their ability to display future flight path information to the pilot and/or the results of pilot control input. Both display symbology sets are designed to follow command guidance from an off-course situa- tion to return to a nominal (null error) solution, known as a compen- satory tracking task. As stated in O'Hare, D, &amp; Roscoe, S., 1990, increasingly such displays cause much 'mental gymnastics' cognitive processing and pilot mental workload, often leading to additional error and total loss of situational control, resulting in full scale deflection, that is, maximum deviation mandating a missed approach. In order to reduce tracking errors and pilot workload, one must provide the pilot with increased situational awareness of the air- craft's relation to the desired flight path, the flight path itself or track, and the actual aircraft performance (flight path vector) as well as the desired/commanded and predicted aircraft performance. The use of a perspective flight guidance displays with a predic- tive flight path/performance symbology set provides that increased situational awareness. Right path vector-based (FPV) Perspective Rightpath Guidance (PFG) provides pilots with an intuitive symbology set which enables the execution of steep precision instrument approaches using a high resolution 2D or 3D-like database in near zero visibility. PFG tech- nology utilizes differential GPS (dGPS) for precision waypoint geolocation, combined with a 'quickened' predictive flight-path- vector and 'tunnel-in-the-sky' pathway guidance to develop an affordable, intuitive, rotorcraft/tiltrotor instrument approach guid- ance symbology system. Effectively designed and implemented, PFG is capable of replacing traditional, workload-intensive, Two- bar and Delta-Veebar flight director terminal approach guidance while providing smaller flight technical error and reduced plot workload. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-2995. TDMA air-to-air surveillance system for heli- copter safety. Masahiko Yokota, Kenzo Ikeuchi, and Naohiko Kuraya, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; Haruhiko Mizuno, NHK Engineering Service, Inc.; and Yoshio Moritaka, Furuno Electric Co., Ltd. The authors developed an air-to-air surveillance system that acquires mutual position and informs the position to the pilot. This system transmits position information obtained by GPS via TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) datalink. Position information received from other aircraft is shown on a display. If proximity con- dition exists, voice alert is activated. This system can be used as an support system for collision avoidance. This paper describes the out- line of the system and flight test result. Two prototype systems were installed on two helicopters. The third system was installed on a ground vehicle. Right tests were performed using these three systems. 2001-01-3000. Use of probabilistics in campaign analysis. Danielle S. Soban and Dimitri N. Mavris, Georgia Institute of Tech- nology. Significant advances have been made recently in applying proba- bilistic methods to aerospace vehicle concepts. Given the explosive changes that are occurring in today's political, social, and techno- logical climate, it makes practical sense to try and extrapolate these methods to the campaign analysis level. This would allow the assessment of rapidly changing threat environments as well as tech- nological advancements, aiding today's decision makers. The fol- lowing paper summarizes attempts to apply these methods directly to campaign analysis, and discusses the resulting issues that were identified as potential problem areas. A new approach is postulated which includes the application of probabilistic methods to a fully linked analysis environment. Applying and validating these new methods is an ongoing project. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 364</page><page sequence="364">2001-01-3001-2001-01-3015 2001-01-3001. Trajectory generation using genetic and sequential quadratic programming methods. John Samsundar, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Co.; and Jason C. Gillette , University of Kentucky. A comparison is made between constrained, two-dimensional, reentry reference trajectories generated by genetic and sequential quadratic programming methods. The objective is to generate a reentry trajectory with minimum control while satisfying constraints on dynamic pressure, heating, lifting, final velocity and altitude. It is shown that the genetic programming method discovered much smoother trajectories that easily satisfy all constraints. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3003. Conceptual control law design for aircraft with reduced tail size. Endang S. L. Handayani and Cees Bil , RM IT Univ.; and Indonesian Aerospace Mudjijanto, Indonesian Aero- space. The design of a longitudinal stability augmentation system (SAS) for an aircraft with reduced tail size in the preliminary design phase is presented. Reducing tail size will reduce drag and weight and result in better fuel consumption, but it will reduce the level of sta- bility. A control law is designed to give the aircraft the same stabil- ity level as that with the initial tail size. The feedback gains of the control law is computed with the equivalent stability derivative criteria of Cma and Cmq. The paper also gives an overview of classi- cal root locus and pole placement method and demonstrates that equivalent stability derivative criteria is suitable for preliminary air- craft design applications. Moreover, the control laws are also syn- thesized using robust control LQG/LTR which can be elaborated more in the detail design phase. 2001-01-3004. Aerospace manufacturing cost prediction from a measure of part definition information. Paul D. Collopy, DEM Consulting ; and David J. H. Eames, Rolls-Royce. At Rolls-Royce, a study determined that manufacturing part cost can be estimated from dimensional data in the part definition. The method appears to be more accurate than mass-based parametric models or process simulation cost models. Additional advantages are: part definition information is causally related to part manufac- turing cost; part definition information is easily available during the design phase; and mature part cost can be estimated even with new manufacturing processes. The theoretical basis for the model uses Shannon's theory of information, work performed at MIT on calculating cost from infor- mation, and the results of the study at Rolls-Royce. 2001-01-3005. Analyses of organizational and individual fac- tors leading to maintenance errors. Manoj S. Patankar, San Jose State Univ.; and James C. Taylor , Santa Clara Univ. Maintenance errors, as reported in 939 ASRS reports, were ana- lyzed to determine primary and secondary causal factors. The taxon- omy of these causal factors was developed by cross-mapping Rea- son's General Failure Types, MEDA' s contributing factors, and the 'Dirty Dozen.' At the primary level, the taxonomies were classified into either organizational-type factors or individual-type factors. At the secondary level, the organizational-type and individual-type fac- tors were combined into one comprehensive list. At the primary causal level, the leading organizational factor was poor procedures or poor quality of information that is available to the maintenance personnel and the leading individual factor was a lack of awareness. At the secondary causal level, the leading factor was poor proce- dures or quality of information. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3008. Quantities, characteristics and reduction potentials of aircraft engine emissions. Andreas Döpelheuer, Ger- man Aerospace Center. This paper describes ways to determine the amount and the com- position of aircraft engine emissions. Findings of all kinds of engine measurement campaigns are taken into account and some emission calculation techniques are addressed. These calculation techniques are used to generate results for aircraft engines at typical operating conditions, for given flight missions and for the global aviation in total. Special emphasize is placed on the mass and the properties of the soot aerosol. Furthermore some possibilities to reduce the emis- sions and the associated reduction potentials are presented. And finally the expected outcome of some ongoing relevant EC-projects is outlined. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3009. Unusual attitude recovery using the roll arrow. Gary Gershzohn, Boeing Co. As part of the NASA High Speed Research program, an unusual attitude (UA), pilot-in-the-loop simulation study provided informa- tion on Primary Flight Display (PFD) symbology factors that affect UA recovery. Overall research objectives were to evaluate symbol- ogy concepts to facilitate pilot perception and safe recovery. It was concluded that UA recognition and recovery task perfor- mance is unacceptable when the pilot relies only on raw data but is improved markedly with appropriate second-generation symbology. The major result indicated that a newly-developed PFD symbol (the Roll Arrow) significantly reduced UA recognition errors. The Roll Arrow is a large, red arrow attached to the PFD Bank Angle Pointer. When the aircraft is in a UA, the Roll Arrow appears on the PFD and points left or right to indicate the required direction to roll for recovery. Other recovery actions are at pilot discretion. In comparison to other evaluated symbology designs, the Roll Arrow was associated with 90% reduction in pilot error. Workload, situation awareness, and pilot opinion all favored the Roll Arrow. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3014. Development of a multi-mission sizing meth- odology applied to the common support aircraft. Dimitri N. Mavris and Nicholas K. Borer , Georgia Institute of Technology. A methodology is developed for the rapid quantification and exploration of the design space of a multi-mission vehicle. This method is applied to the Common Support Aircraft, a vehicle with four separate missions, to determine which is most critical to size the vehicle. The Airborne Early Warning mission is shown to be critical for sizing the Common Support Aircraft. Furthermore, the method developed gives a feel for the excess capability of the air- craft in its other support roles. Finally, this methodology is shown to be useful in the creation of balanced requirements for multi- mission vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3015. An improved procedure for prediction of drag polars of a joined wing concept using physics-based response surface methodology. Sriram K. Rallabhandi, Eroi Cagatay, and Dimitri N. Mavris , Georgia Institute of Technology. Creation and utilization of accurate drag polars is essential in the aircraft sizing and synthesis process. Existing sizing and synthesis codes are based on historical data and cannot capture the aerody- namics of a non-conventional aircraft at the conceptual design phase. The fidelity of the aerodynamic analysis should be enhanced to increase the designer's confidence in the results. Hence, there is need for a physics-based approach to generate the drag polars of an aircraft lying outside the conventional realm. The deficiencies of the legacy codes should be removed and replaced with higher fidelity meta-model representations. This is facilitated with response surface methodology (RSM), which is a mathematical and statistical tech- nique that is suited for the modeling and analysis of problems in which the responses, the drag coefficients in this case, are influ- enced by several variables. The geometric input variables are chosen so that they represent a multitude of configurations. Analytically created Response Surface Equations then replace the empirical aero- dynamic relations and historical data found in sizing and synthesis 365</page><page sequence="365">2001-01-3015-2001-01-3030 codes, such as Flight Optimization System (FLOPS). The response surface equations obtained can be used in the system level studies and optimization. The approach described here is a statistics-based methodology, which combines the use of Design of Experiments and Response Surface Method. Computational aerodynamic codes based on linearized potential flow (HASC) and boundary layer the- ory (BDAP) are employed to generate the needed parametric rela- tionships. The aforementioned process is demonstrated through the implementation on a joined- wing concept. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3017. Identification of the requirements space topol- ogy for a rapid response strike system. Peter Hollingsworth and Dimitri Mavris, Georgia Institute of Technology. A method to identify the topology of an aerospace system's requirements space, specifically the location and type of the discon- tinuities that occur at the boundaries of the available technology and the physics of the system, allows the designer to make decisions as to the desirability of a specific solution state. Additionally, since a given set of requirements may produce multiple solutions the designer can compare his/her solution to other potential solutions. This allows an assessment of the requirements risk associated with a specific design. This paper addresses the need to visualize and understand the topology of the requirements space for a Rapid Response Strike System. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3018. A technique for selecting emerging technolo- gies for a fleet of commercial aircraft to maximize R&amp;D invest- ment. Michelle R. Kirby and Dimitri N. Mavris , Georgia Institute of Technology. A solid business case is highly dependent upon a strategic tech- nology research and development plan in the early phases of product design. The embodiment of a strategic technology development plan is the identification and subsequent funding of high payoff technol- ogy programs that can maximize a company's return on investment, which entails both performance and economic objectives. This paper describes a technique whereby the high payoff technologies may be identified across multiple platforms to quantitatively justify resource allocation decisions and investment opportunities. A proof of concept investigation was performed on a fleet of subsonic, com- mercial aircraft. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3025. Aviation safety plans: Content and training. Paul Werner and Richard Perry , Sandia National Laboratories. Airline safety programs are created to achieve specific objec- tives. There are many excellent safety programs related to training (e.g., AQP, ASAP), each addressing specific requirements of an organization's operational needs. The best program will be ineffec- tive in terms of safety benefit, effectiveness, and economic costs if not considered in a system frame of reference. Most notable to the success of an aviation safety plan is the organization's culture, espe- cially its safety culture. In this paper, we will address the content and training portion of Safety plans in a top-down systemic way, to include safety culture and several of systems and organizational aspects to safety plans. 2001-01-3026. Reviewing the role of cockpit alerting systems: Implications for alerting system design and pilot training. Amy R. Pritchett, Georgia Institute of Technology. This paper builds upon recent studies of alerting systems by dis- cussing the relationship between system design and pilot training. Background is provided on alerting system design, pilot training, and studies examining their relationship. The paper then describes the difficulties and benefits of increased pilot training about alerting systems, with its implications for the roles given to alerting systems and pilot trust. Specific discussion is also provided on training pilots for improved acceptance of false alarms, on the conflicting mes- sages often given to pilots about appropriate alerting system use, and procedures governing alerting system use. The paper concludes with discussion on the implications for alerting system design and pilot training. 2001-01-3027. A paradigm for developing operational deci- sion-making (ODM) training. Kevin M. Smith, United Air Lines; and Ronald John Lofaro, Embry Riddle Aeronautical Univ. The views and opinions expressed in this paper are solely those of the authors. They do not necessarily represent the positions or policies of any private, public or governmental organizations. Over the past 8 years, the authors have been developing a training- oriented paradigm for operational decision-making in the cockpit. While our emphasis has been on the civil aviation side, the model can easily adapted for the business aviation venue. The paradigm began to form at an aeronautical decision-making workshop in 1992 (Lofaro, Adams and Adams; 1992) around an expanding set of inter- related concepts. The set expansion resulted from the authors con- tinuing to wrestle with identifying and explicating the critical com- ponents and processes for real-time operational decision-making, as well as the relationships among decision-making, crew resource management (CRM) and situation awareness (SA). The first para- digm component was the 'rising risk continuum' (Lofaro and Smith, 1993), as embedded in event sets for LOFT. Later, the concepts/ components of 'critical mission impact areas' and the 'critical mis- sion factors' (Lofaro and Smith, 1998) that composed these mission critical areas were added. The final components are the operational envelope, cumulative risk and risk location in the ops envelope (Smith and Lofaro, 2001). In the model, the 'pilot as risk manager' (Smith and Hastie, 1992; Lofaro and Smith, 1998; 1999) was both the overlay and glue for the components. Recently, one author found the details of a real-life example of a Part 121 carrier approach/landing. This will be used to, first, show how the model can be used in real time and, second, contrast the decisions that would have been reached using the model with those actually reached by the Captain and, the results of the Captain's decisions. 2001-01-3028. Dynamometer simulation of aircraft tire wear due to braking. John P. Medzorian, Air Force Research Labora- tory; and Mark A. Shea, Boeing. Laboratory and aircraft flight testing indicates that braking is the primary driver of tire wear on tactical aircraft, and that steps can be taken to significantly improve the tire wear performance. The effects of numerous other factors including aircraft characteristics, runway surface texture, tire tread compound, tire pressure, and envi- ronmental conditions were also evaluated under the Air Force's Improved Tire Life and Extended Life Tire programs. Laboratory testing of tire wear performance using the new 168i internal roadwh- eel dynamometer was successfully demonstrated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3029. The Boeing Condor. David Nixon, Hiller Avia- tion Institute. One of the most spectacular aircraft exhibits in the Hiller Avia- tion Museum is the Boeing Condor. The Condor was developed under funding from Boeing and the Department of Defense in the 1980s to evaluate technologies for high altitude, long endurance flight. Although the airplane only made eight test flights, the Condor set two world records. This paper describes most of the publicly available details of the aircraft and its test program. 2001-01-3030. German V/STOL transport programs in the twentieth century. Michael J. Hirschberg, CENTRA Technology, Inc.; Thomas Müller, Salzmann Buchhandlung Waltershausen; and Hans A. Niedzballa, Technische Universität München. In the mid-1950s, the German Luftwaffe began to develop a number of Vertical and/or Short Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) aircraft as deterrents in a nuclear threat environment. Subsequently, large V/STOL transports were considered as a way of reducing com- 366</page><page sequence="366">2001-01-3030-2001-01-3040 mereiai aircraft traffic congestion. Despite extensive design studies, component tests and even flight testing, none of the designs ever reached production. These large V/STOL transport designs are dis- cussed here. 2001-01-3031. High-performance executive transport design employing twin oblique lifting surfaces. Askin T. Isikveren, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). This paper presents a new Trans- Atlantic high-performance executive transport suitability equipped to offer accommodation for 19 first-class passengers. The unique feature of this conceptual design is application of Twin Oblique Lifting Surfaces or TOLS configuration. Minimum goals for the design included: similar max- imum takeoff gross weight; satisfactory field performance; good stalling characteristics; and, competitive fuel burn qualities at high- transonic and low-supersonic speeds, i.e., M0.90-1.20, compared to contemporary M0.75-0.85 large and super-large business jets. The vehicle is to be powered by two medium by-pass derivative engines based on the BMW-Rolls Royce BR715 in an effort to maximize the likelihood of availability, ensure adequate en route performance efficiency and fulfillment of yet to be ratified Stage 4 noise compli- ance requirements. 2001-01-3033. A Bayesian approach to non-deterministic hypersonic vehicle design. George C. Mantis and Dimitri N. Mavris, Georgia Institute of Technology. Affordable, reliable endo- and exoatmospheric transportation, for both the military and commercial sectors, grows in importance as the world grows smaller and space exploration and exploitation increasingly impact our daily lives. However, the impact of disci- plinary, operational, and technological uncertainties inhibit the design of the requisite hypersonic vehicles, an inherently multidisci- plinary and non-deterministic process. Without investigation, these components of design uncertainty undermine the designers' deci- sion-making confidence. In this paper, the authors propose a new probabilistic design method, using Bayesian Statistics techniques, which allows assessment of the impact of disciplinary uncertainty on the confidence in the design solution. The proposed development of a two-stage reusable launch vehicle configuration highlights the means to first quantify the fidelity of the disciplinary analysis tools utilized, then propagate such to the vehicle system level. 2001-01-3034. Development of an object-oriented vehicle library for automated design analysis. Julien Scharl and Dimitri N. Mavris , Georgia Institute of Technology. In today's emerging parametric and probabilistic design environ- ments, disciplinary or multidisciplinary analysis data are repre- sented efficiently with the use of metamodels. Each metamodel is an efficient replacement for a particular design analysis tool. An object-oriented library is developed in this paper to represent vehicle configuration in a generic manner and assist the analysis data collec- tion for the metamodeling process. The library is used to produce input files for design analysis tools. It can also be used to create pre- processors for integration environments used in the design process. This allows for smoother integrations of analysis programs within such environments as the environment now needs only replace data in one central input file rather than a file for each analysis tool. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Aerospace 2001-01-3035. An integrated human modeling simulation process for the International Space Station, intra-vehicular activity. J anis L. Hebermehl and Terri B. Graham , Boeing Co. Defining a process for integrating human modeling within the design and verification activities of the International Space Station (ISS) has proven to be as important as the simulations themselves. The process developed (1) ensured configuration management of the required digital mockups, (2) provided consistent methodology for simulating and analyzing human tasks and hardware layout, (3) facilitated an efficient method of communicating design require- ments and relaying satisfaction of contract requirements, and (4) provided substantial cost savings by reducing the amount of late redesign and expensive mockup tests. Human simulation is frequently the last step in the design pro- cess. Consequently, the influence it has on product design is mini- mal and oftentimes being used as a post-design verification tool. This paper presents an integrated human modeling simulation pro- cess that demonstrates the use of the Boeing Human Modeling Sys- tem (BHMS) as a design and training tool for the International Space Station. 2001-01-3036. Future combat aircraft capacities offered by advanced technologies. Myriam Goldsztejn, DASSAULT AVIA- TION. The chicken or the egg, which came first? The same question applies to military needs and technologies. It is certainly an iterative process between the Forces, their acquisition agencies and the industries. The more requirements, the more the industry gives. But is there a limit? Will the limit come from the cost? This could have been the solution if everybody had not thought of developing technolo- gies to reduce the costs. Today there are no limits to the imagination and no limits to the information technologies. Only the limit of the physics will (or what we know of the physics) could put an end to the requirements. 2001-01-3037. Maintenance and engineering: Keeping air- planes in the sky. Louis J. Mancini, United Airlines. The role of maintenance and engineering professionals is to assure that every airplane dispatched into commercial airline service conforms to the highest standards of safety and reliability that avail- able technology and the regulatory environment will permit. The accomplishment of this mission requires that a complex support sys- tem be established that can continually assess the health of the air- plane and engine over a demanding lifetime that involves six com- plete overhauls and 400,000 man-hours of checks and maintenance activity. The successful implementation of the thousands of details that must never be compromised during this period demands that the 'care givers'be provided the best possible products, processes, and personnel support systems available. This paper describes steps being taken at United Airlines to address those requirements, through the assimilation of new technology, improved training and communication, and continuous process improvement, all of which are necessary precursors that airlines must accept in order to be safe and viable business enterprises in a rapidly expanding U.S. air trans- portation system. 2001-01-3040. A fuzzy-analytic-hierarchical-process model for the metal decision in the automotive industry. Andre de Kor- vin, University of Houston Downtown; Mohamed E. Bayou, Univer- sity of Michigan-Dearborn; and Robert Kleyle, Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis. Currently, the automobile industry faces increasing pressure to reduce the weight of vehicles in order to realize better fuel economy and reduced polluting emissions. Therefore, the long-term domi- nance of steel and iron as the main ferrous metals used in is about to change. Aluminum has become a prime candidate to replace steel. However, the decision to use steel or aluminum is a complex one, requiring a sophisticated decision model. This paper generalizes and applies de Korvin and Kleyle' s (1999) fuzzy-analytic-hierarchical-process (FAHP) model. This generalized FAHP model is a powerful tool to tackle many complex decisions without relying on limiting definitions or unrealistic assumptions. The paper uses a concrete illustration to simplify the intricate methodology of FAHP that should help managers and con- trollers apply this model. 367</page><page sequence="367">2001-01-3041-2001-01-3046 2001-01-3041. New high strength steels help automakers reach future goals for safety, affordability, fuel efficiency and environmental responsibility. Jody R. Shaw , United States Steel LLC; and Blake K. Zuidema, National Steel Corp. Vehicle weight reduction, reduced costs and improved safety performance are the main driving forces behind material selection for automotive applications. High-strength steels (HSS) have dem- onstrated their ability to meet these demands and consequently have been the fastest growing light-weighting material in vehicle struc- tures for the past decade. The evolution in steel technology in recent years has produced new grades of highly formable, advanced high- strength steel (AHSS) grades that will continue to meet these auto- motive demands into the next decade. This paper describes how the remarkable combination of formability, strength, ductility, durabil- ity, strain-rate sensitivity and strain hardening characteristics of the AHSS grades enable affordable weight reduction while improving crash safety. ULSAB-Advanced Vehicle Concepts (AVC) raises automotive steel design to new levels of mass and performance optimization through extensive use of ultra high strength steels (UHSS) and advanced high-strength steels (AHSS) in vehicles designed to sat- isfy future environmental and crash worthiness mandates. This paper defines these advanced steels, compares their metallurgical struc- tures, alloy design, and mechanical behavior to those qualities in the current family of high-strength steels (HSS), and reviews the ratio- nale for using these materials in vehicles for 2004 and beyond. Included in the discussion are Dual Phase (DP) Steels, Transforma- tion Inducted Plasticity (Trip) Steels, Complex Phase (CP) Steels, and Martensitic (Mart) Steels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3042. New high strength steels applied to the body structure of ULSAB-AVC. Blake K. Zuidema and Stephen G. Den- ner, National Steel Corp.; Bernhard Engl , Thyssen-Krupp Stahl; and Jan-Olof Sperle, SSAB Tunnplât AB. In the ULSAB Project released in 1998, high-strength steels (HSS) were applied to 90 percent of the body and structural compo- nents, and a mass saving of 25 percent compared to an average of benchmark vehicles was achieved. In the ULSAB-Advanced Vehi- cle Concepts (AVC) Project, high-strength steels are used for most of the components, but many of these materials are identified as ultra-high-strength steel (UHSS) grades of advanced high-strength steels. These grades include dual phase (DP) from 280 MPa yield (YS) to 1000 MPa tensile (UTS), complex phase (CP) 700/800 MPa (YS/UTS), and martensitic (Mart) 1200 MPa and 1520 MPa (UTS) grades. This paper reviews how these materials are applied to spe- cific parts of the ULSAB-AVC Class-C and Class-PNGV vehicle concepts and the reasons for their selection. It also compares the materials used in the body structures of ULSAB and ULSAB-AVC 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3043. Benefits of using pre-treated, pre-aged alumi- num 6xxx sheet material for closure applications. Chris Lahaye and Jan Bottema, Corns RD&amp;T; and Peter De Smet and Stephan Heyvaert, Corus Aluminium. Weight reduction is the key argument for the application of alu- minum in cars. However, the extra costs and its limited formability compared to steel slow down the increase in volume. Application of dry lubricants improves the forming behavior as well as reduce the sensitivity to surface damage. A pre-treatment of the surface before assembly is necessary in order to guarantee a good durability of the joints. Cost optimization can be realized when downgauging possibili- ties of pre-aged material (Superlite) having an improved bake- hardening response are utilized. A further possibility for cost optim- ization at the car manufacturer is created when the supplier performs all three processing steps (pre-aging, pre-treatment and dry- lubricant) in one continuous annealing and surface pre-treatment line. 2001-01-3044. Body-in-white weight reduction via probabi- listic modeling of manufacturing variations. Andreas Vlahinos, Advanced Engineering Solutions, LLC; and Subhash Kelkar, Ford Motor Company. A design is robust when it is not sensitive to variations in noise parameters such as manufacturing tolerances, material properties, environmental temperature, humidity, etc. In recent years, several robust design concepts have been introduced in an effort to obtain optimum designs and minimize the variation in the product charac- teristics. In this study, a probabilistic design analysis was performed in order to develop a robust design with the mean value of the result- ing stress at target, and minimum standard deviation. The methodol- ogy for implementing robust design used in this research effort is summarized in a reusable workflow diagram. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3045. Economic analysis of two different door archi- tectures. Sebastian K. Fixson, Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy ; and Patrick J. Blanchard, Ford Motor Company. In the past, materials selection for automotive components has been managed on a part-by-part basis. As a result, the economics of these selections have often been reduced to comparing material price/property ratios, rather than technological options. More recently, the debate around modular designs and their advantages and disadvantages has shifted the emphasis towards a higher level viewpoint that deals with more complex systems. This approach provides the opportunity to search for new combinations of product architecture and materials that may exploit specific mate- rial advantages better than the classic part-by-part replacement. This paper presents the results of an economic analysis for two different door designs. The door designs differ both with regards to their product architectures and with regards to the materials they employ. The economic analysis considers the following process steps: parts fabrication, subassembly, paint, and final assembly (trim) for two production scenarios. The case study reveals several findings. First, the analysis con- cludes that both door designs offer a potential economic advantage depending on the final production volume. Specifically, the conven- tional design is considered more appropriate for high volume pro- duction, whilst the alternative design is more cost effective at pro- duction volumes typical of niche and derivative vehicles. Second, since the choice of design architecture has an influence on all sub systems, meaningful comparisons between the architectures may be made only through the adoption of comprehensive cost models. For example, the case study demonstrates that the choice of certain prod- uct architectures can help mitigate disadvantages caused by higher input material costs. Finally, the case study finds that the cost sav- ings from 'commonization' of components vary depending on the base production volume. 2001-01-3046. Simulation-driven car body development using property-based models. Magnus Eriksson, Luleâ University of Technology; and Nicklas Bylund, Volvo Car Corporation. A method for the development of car bodies, from conceptual to detailed design, is presented. The conceptual design is broken down to a numerical property-based model (PBM) representing the mechanical behavior of the concept. In the PBM, the local properties are balanced to fulfill the global stiffness requirements. The main topology is defined and the structural components, i.e., joints, beams and sheets are connected in predefined nodes and represented in a finite element (FE) model as super elements, beam elements and thin shell elements. In the realization of the car structure, the perfor- mance of the PBM components are used as requirements in the detailed design. Different technologies, materials and manufactur- ing processes can be considered as long as the properties of the com- ponent agree with the ones stated by the PBM. The detailed design of each component is made by design engineers, supported by single purpose tools. The design engineers iterate the design until only a small difference between target and component performance exists. 368</page><page sequence="368">2001-01-3047-2001-01-3053 2001-01-3047. Static and dynamic denting of paint baked AA6111 panels: Comparison of finite element predictions and experiments. Dylan Thomas, Center for Automotive Materials and Manufacturing; Blake Hodgins and Michael Worswick, University of Waterloo; and Mark J. Finn and Kevin Gong, ALCAN Interna- tional Limited. This work presents comparisons of finite element model predic- tions of static and dynamic denting with experimental results. Panels were stamped from 0.81, 0.93 and 1.00 mm AA6111-T4 and then paint-baked to produce representative automotive outer body panels. Each type of panel was statically and dynamically dented at three locations using a 25.4 mm steel ball. Static denting was accom- plished with incremental loading of 22.24N loads up to a maximum of 244.48N. Dynamic denting was accomplished by dropping the steel ball from heights ranging from 200 mm to 1200 mm. Multi- stage finite element analysis was performed using LS-DYNA and ABAQUS to predict the entire process of forming, spring-back, denting and final spring-back of the dented panels. The predicted results show good correlation with the experiments, but also high- light the sensitivity of the predictions to formulation of the finite ele- ment problem. To this end it is particularly important to use the best available material data, accurate element formulations, prior work hardening effects and a sufficiently refined mesh if accurate results are to be obtained. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3048. Simplified approach for formability simula- tion of automotive body structures. Jacqueline El-Sayed and Hak- cheen Kim, Kettering University ; and Robert Frutiger and William Liu, General Motors Corporation. This paper presents a simplified approach for formability simula- tion of automotive body structural sections in the early design stage of vehicle development process. Plane strain approach is investi- gated for its applicability and accuracy by comparing the analytical results with the measured results of automotive body side panel. The plane strain approach was tried based on the fact that for a certain section location of a stamped panel, the minor strains are relatively small and negligible compared to the major strains. The state of plane strain can be induced mainly through symmetry and applied boundary conditions. This approach is both cost effective and time saving for analyzing sheet metal formability in early vehicle devel- opment stage, since only few sections of the entire panel need be analyzed. To demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the approach the analytical results of the commercial FEA software AUTOFORM2. 1 is used in comparison with the results from actual measurements. 2001-01-3049. Application of CAE simulation in 2002 Jeep Liberty vehicle development. R. Dhulipudi, S. Drobot, S. Nayak, and A. Pol, DaimlerChrysler Corp.; S. Gogate, Altair Engineering, Inc.; and K. Potty, Quantum Consultants, Inc. Extensive Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) Analysis was done at DaimlerChrysler in developing the all-new 2002 Jeep Lib- erty body structure. Vehicle Simulations were performed during the development cycle to continuously improve the design for various disciplines such as NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness), Impact and Durability. This paper discusses the methodology adopted for CAE analysis and the benefits seen in the final product due to the use of CAE tools. 2001-01-3050. The effect of forming on automotive crash results. Trevor Dutton, Richard Sturt, Paul Richardson, and Andrew Knight, Ove Arup &amp; Partners International Ltd. The thickness changes and work hardening arising during the forming process are generally ignored in crash analysis. This paper quantifies the effect of the forming process on crash response of a typical car of stamped steel construction using an analytical study. Forming results for fourteen panels of a medium-sized car were calculated using a one-step stamping analysis code. These were imported into the crash model, and crash results compared with and without the forming effects. The time taken to generate the forming data by a variety of methods is quantified, and the trade-off between the time taken and accuracy is examined. An efficient method of importing the forming data into the crash model is presented. 2001-01-3051. How the modeling of virtual materials can secure part feasibility. Joergy Gerlach, Udo Paul, and Klaus Blii- mel, Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG. The paper describes a method applied to show how to perform a steel sheet metal sensitivity analyses while the material is sub- jected to stretch forming and deep drawing. It is shown that the sen- sitivity analysis provides meaningful results. Simulations were run with simplified laboratory geometries and extended for the most complex automotive parts. The variety of likely numerical runs are dramatically reduced by means of a statistical design of experi- ments, minimizing the number of simulations required for daily use. As a result it is possible to choose the optimal material for a specific forming process and part, as well as to assess the expected scattering in the material properties. 2001-01-3052. Analysis and design of slow build studies dur- ing sheet metal assembly validations. Luis Garcia Guzman and Patrick C. Hammett, The University of Michigan. Several manufacturers are adopting six sigma programs in efforts to reduce stamping variation. This requires the crucial step of estab- lishing dimensional relationships for the stamping dimensional out- puts that become key process inputs to the assembly process. This paper describes a methodology used to determine the root cause of dimensional changes in a front door assembly. Among the key find- ings in this study are the importance of understanding the effects of the datum-locating scheme and the significant influence of assembly processing variables, rather than stamping variability, on the final door assembly dimensional quality. 2001-01-3053. Massive point cloud data sets and single point measurement acquisition in the production floor environment. Eyal Mizrahi, CogniTens 3D Vision Systems Inc.; and Ron Ger shon and Meny Benady, CogniTens 3D Vision Systems Ltd. In typical production lines of automotive manufacturers, body parts are produced every several minutes. Sample parts are mea- sured at certain intervals with a CMM machine at approximately 30 points to verify correct production. The points measured on each sample part are compared with reference points of a golden part or with the CAD model. This paper presents results achieved with a high-accuracy non- contact 3D measurement system capable of measuring both the full surface of sample parts and surface points (surface point measure- ment, or SPM), after production, on the production floor. The tech- nology used enables high-speed image acquisition of large data sets together with CMM-like capability of measuring individual points, both accomplished simultaneously. SPM measurement of a car door requires approximately 15 minutes; measurement of a full door sur- face, including SPM, requires less than 1 hour if operated manually, or alternatively 3 minutes for SPM and approximately 10 minutes for full surface measurement if performed by a robot-based system. The system is capable of measuring shiny, oily and/or dirty parts, which makes it suitable for measurement right on the production floor. The resulting surfaces and points measured are aligned to vehicle coordinates by the system, and compared to the CAD design. SPMs are compared to their reference points, and reports are exportable. Examples of series of COP/CAD comparisons will be presented, taken on the production floor, illustrating the gradual development of a production defect and its detection with the full surface data. Such defects can immediately be found, when measuring the entire 369</page><page sequence="369">2001-01-3053-2001-01-3061 surface of each part, during production (in process).

Described are the development, integration and industrial imple- mentation of flexible vision inspection systems using a commercial industrial robot. Recent advances in robot and vision technology, as well as related software have made such integration practical and successful in the production environment. A fully integrated system is described, with vision processing resident in the robot controller. This integrated system reduces floor space requirements and improves data acquisition rates relative to non-integrated systems. Also, a temperature compensation method- ology has been implemented with the system to eliminate errors due to thermal changes in the robot due to both internal heat generation and changes in the operating environment. Implementation examples of systems applied to both off-line and in-line stations are provided. Off-line system applications include replacement of multiple check fixtures to reduce cost and floor space requirements. In-line 100% inspection applications include inspection of major subassemblies and body-in-white. Test results regarding accuracy, repeatability and cycle time are described. Comparisons of flexible robotic implementations to more traditional dedicated or fixed sensor systems are provided, compar- ing cycle times, repeatability, and other factors are discussed, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. A comparison of integrated and non-integrated vision robot system performance is also provided. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3055. Specifying a control program with high-level graphical editors. Marvin J. Schwenke and Raymond J. S tar on, Rockwell Automation. This paper presents a graphical application-oriented develop- ment environment that can reduce the cost of control software devel- opment. It consists of a sample set of editors targeted toward machining and welding operations. These editors solicit from the user the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the physical implementation of his machine and the behavior of the machine in a style familiar to OEMs, end users, and designers. Each editor is loosely based on a schematic diagram that OEMs use when building machine tools. The information extracted by these editors is then used to gener- ate a symbolic representation of the control code. Lastly, the devel- opment environment can then automatically generate the resulting ladder logic for a specific control system and list of input/output address assignments. The net result is that this environment increases the user's productivity, reduces debugging and startup time, eliminates or reduces rework, and enforces control and coding standards. 2001-01-3056. Theoretical approach for pillar trim design to reduce head injury. Hyoung-Gon Kim and Dong-Seok Kim , Dae- woo Motor Co., Ltd. This paper presents an analytic method to estimate the proper space and stiffness of the vehicle's pillar trim to meet FMVSS 201 head injury criteria. A practical guideline curve, which is used in determining the adequate space and stiffness of pillar trim, is derived assuming haversine curve for the head impact pulse. Rib structure of pillar trim, which has a required stiffness, is designed using further simplification that models the BIW and the trim as equivalent springs. The required stiffness of the trim was achieved by adding a rib structure to it, and the shape of the rib structure was obtained using finite element analysis. Finite element analysis and experiment were conducted to validate the design of the trim, and the results were very close to the required stiffness. 2001-01-3057.

Analysis of different countermeasures in response to FMVSS 201 upper interior head impact protection and a comparison study on the injury parameters and energy absorption. Arun Chickmenahalli, Lear Corp. In response to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 201 upper interior head impact protection, development of a suitable countermeasure has become an important aspect. FMVSS 201 safety regulation stipulates that the Head Injury Criterion, HIC(d) should be less than 1000 when a FMH is impacted at a speed of 15 mph. The interior components of a vehicle generally do not generate high HIC(d) numbers by themselves but the steel structures behind them to which they are attached do so. The gap between the interior component and the steel structure makes a provision for the intro- duction of some countermeasures which can absorb the kinetic energy of the FMH in the form of internal energy so that the acceler- ation response of the FMH does not generate high HIC(d) and Peak G force. This paper discusses the analysis of different countermea- sures using a dynamic finite element tool LS-DYNA for automotive interior components to comply with FMVSS 201 requirements. The effectiveness of introducing a countermeasure between the head- liner and the steel structure or the body in white (BIW) is evaluated. Several materials for the countermeasure have been analyzed and a comparison is made in terms of injury parameters, HIC(d) and Peak G. Comparison is also made for the energy absorption by the different countermeasures. Several geometric configurations of the countermeasure have been studied to ascertain its suitability in absorbing the kinetic energy of the FMH. Parametric studies have been carried out by varying the thickness of the countermeasure to see the effect on the injury parameters, HIC(d) and Peak G. Finite element analysis results match very closely with the test results as per the FMVSS 201 regulations which makes it possible to design an effective countermeasure. 2001-01-3061. No postcure RRIM for automotive exteriors. Michael F. Hurley, Bayer Corp. Reinforced reaction injection molding (RRIM) has re-emerged as an important method in automotive exterior applications. Pres- ently composite applications demand higher productivity and improved part performance. Stability at higher heat to endure E-coat oven bake, improvements in fillers yielding easier processing at high loading, improved toughness at high modulus, and higher pro- ductivity have already been realized with RRIM in Europe and NAFTA. Now the kinetics of one new material, Bayflex 190 is such that reaction is essentially complete at demold. In the past RRIM- molded parts were required to be baked at 120°C and above to com- plete chemical reactions, attain complete physical properties, and de-gas parts prior to painting. In current E-coat applications post- cure of 190°C is typical. Elimination of postcure means significant savings in energy, increased productivity, decreased handling and lower capital expense. Bayflex 190 polyurea attains virtually all properties at demold. After molding parts can be washed and primed directly. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows that further heating to 200° C anneals and strengthens the composite. Several very sensitive analytical methods have been employed to characterize the degree of cure at demold. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) shows no exothermic chemical reaction up to 200°C. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows no CO2 loss from unreacted isocyanates. And Fourier transform infrared spec- 370</page><page sequence="370">200 1 -0 1 -306 1-200 1 -0 1 -3068 troscopy (FTIR) scans indicate no free isocyanate in freshly molded samples.

Dinesh Seksaria and Sherri McCleary, Alcoa Inc.; and Kenneth Nelson , DuPont. Light-duty pickup trucks have been and are an important grow- ing segment of the US automotive market. Like all other vehicles on the road, they must also do their part to conserve fuel and weight reduction is a vital tool for achieving this goal. Tailgates currently installed on pickup trucks typically weigh over 30 lbs. and weight loss in these panels is very desirable. Recent demographic shifts in truck users has also lead to more interest in light- weighting of com- ponents like the tailgate for ergonomie reasons. Manufacturers have reached the limit for light-weighting tail- gates using current materials and manufacturing processes. This new concept changes the paradigm. It uses a hybrid system of alumi- num and plastic composite materials along with new manufacturing and assembly processes to achieve a significant weight reduction without compromising performance or other desired attributes. This paper describes the design and demonstrates its viability via analysis and test results. This new concept was aimed at achieving these fuel- efficiency and ergonomie benefits with minimal cost penalty. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3063. Developing world-class customer fit objec- tives, utilizing competitive benchmarking techniques. Daryl Rothamer, Heath Ehlinger, Anton Jones , and Mark Jakubisin, DaimlerChrysler Corporation/W el-Tech. Increased competition, both foreign and domestic, has forced automotive companies to take a closer look at the quality of current and future products. Historically, fit objectives were a by-product of design, process and part functionality. That is no longer a compet- itive approach. Now it is of the utmost importance to proactively define competitive quality targets in the beginning of new vehicle programs. When objectives are established early in the program, they influence design and process. The procedure used to develop dimensional objectives should include benchmarking of company vehicles and key competitive vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to explain a process that can be used to formulate customer fit objectives based on competitive bench- mark vehicle data. This paper will describe a step by step process designed to create world class fit objectives. The process is orga- nized into five phases: Phase 1 - Identify Competitive Targets, Phase 2 - Executive Walk-around, Phase 3 - Data Collection &amp; Analysis, Phase 4 - Follow-up Walk- Around, and Phase 5 - Establish Fit Objectives. Key elements of this process include: identifying competitive vehicles, creating a team environment within the company (includ- ing design, body engineering, assembly, and stamping), early imple- mentation of milestone events in the vehicle program timeline, and gaining the support of management. 2001-01-3064. Application of variation simulation in body assembly process design. Tengyun Cao , Chetan Rastogi, and Ching Hsieh , General Motors Corp. Build variation has long been recognized as one of the most important factors in vehicle performance. In this study an elastic assembly simulation program is used to guide a wheelhouse assem- bly process design to reduce build variation. Five (5) different clamping schemes are evaluated through the simulation program. From the five proposed process design choices, the best assembly process was identified, which results in reduced assembly variation and less tooling and manufacturing costs. Two different variation simulation approaches, one based on per- turbation and the other based on Design of Experiments, were used to predict the assembly variation. Good agreement between the two approaches provided a validity check for the simulation tool. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3065. Math-based datum selection and optimization for body panels and sub-assemblies. Chetan Rastogi, Robert L. Frutiger, Peter Yoon, and Henry Lin, General Motors Corporation. In the automotive industry there is a continual drive to reduce cost and improve processing flexibility in the assembly plants. The competitive market place demands flexible and common processes to help reduce assembly costs and improve build quality. The selec- tion of these common processes requires experience based knowl- edge to pick the best practice among a set of alternatives. This paper demonstrates how math-based manufacturing analysis can be used to help in this selection process. Within General Motors Corporation, the BOP (Bill Of Process) represents a globally templated approach to manufacturing and assembling vehicles. All vehicle programs are required to follow the common BOP. Broadly defined, the BOP is a set of common pro- cessing standards relating to datum number and selection, number of stations required to build a sub assembly, etc. Full implementation of the BOP allows General Motors Corpora- tion to leverage resources globally, reduce manufacturing costs, and shortens the feedback cycle in our learning organization. As General Motors Corporation converges towards a common BOP numerous debates arise as to the suitability and selection of various processing methods. This report is an attempt to use system- atic, math-based, deterministic and stochastic FEA (Finite Element Analysis) methods to guide BOP development. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3066.

When measuring sheet metal with hard gages or using CMM holding fixtures at multiple sites, the following factors must be con- sidered: 1) Datums must be coordinated 2) Part orientation must be common with respect to gravity 3) Clamp sequence must be the same 4) Measurement points and approach angles must be identical When measuring sheet metal with flexible fixturing, such as a DEA System 5 (Manufactured by DEA Brown &amp; Sharpe), at multi- ple sites, additional factors come into play: 5) The locations of the programmable sheet metal supports (com- monly called bowling pins) must be alike and positioned at, or as close as possible to, the same datums 6) Clamping devices generally are not necessary 7) The alignment points must be alike 8) The quantity of iterations and acceptance criteria used for best fit must be the same 9) Alignment points must be output in the measurement report This paper will describe and demonstrate the importance of all of these factors and focus on the ones, which are unique to flexible fixturing systems, such as the DEA System 5. 2001-01-3068. Crossmember design process - A case study. S. Edward Law, DaimlerChrysler Corp.; and David R. Widmer, Aetna Industries, Inc. A detailed account of each step of the process in the design and development of a crossmember will be provided. Many of the ideas can be applied to any crossmembers such as radiator crossmember, seat crossmembers, front suspension crossmember or rear suspen- 371</page><page sequence="371">2001-01-3068-2001-01-3075 sion crossmember. The discussion in this paper only applies to welded assemblies of stamped sheet metal parts and not castings. A case study is presented to show how a front suspension crossmem- ber was successfully designed and developed. 2001-01-3069. High-strength steel skid plates: A design optimization study. Paul McKune, U.S. Steel ; and Anthony Chih-Yu Lin , Ford Motor Company. The purpose of this paper is to show that certain steel skid plates can achieve up to a 50% weight reduction, with little or no increase in cost, by simply changing the shape and utilizing high- strength steel. There are many factors that can influence the skid plate shape, including rail width, ground clearance, attachment points, drive shaft location, and the general shape of the object for which it is the skid plate's sole purpose to protect (fuel tank, transfer case, etc.). A skid plate is usually considered last from a design standpoint so that its design is dependent upon the environment which it is set in. For this reason, skid plates are generally heavy and flat to meet ground clearance requirements and have ribs inserted to increase stiffness. Sometimes design parameters require a skid plate to be heavy and flat. But more often, a stiffer lightweight design can be obtained. This paper will demonstrate a few ways to achieve a suc- cessful skid plate design while gaining some other unexpected bene- fits described herein. 2001-01-3070. Material characterization and computer mod- eling help optimize automobile parts and their manufacturing. Ben Chouchaoui, Windsor Industrial Development Laboratory , inc. Automobile part suppliers have always relied on trial and error in developing products and processes. Prototypes are built for test- ing results of which are used to alter the design of a part or the way to make it till arriving to a compromise. This approach is unfortu- nately not effective: it costs time and money. Further, resulting products or processes are not optimum. An alternative to the traditional trial and error product and pro- cess development is still trial and error, but on a computer. Products or ways to make them are simulated through combined materials and finite element analyses. The design of a part can be altered faster and at a low cost as can changes to materials and the manufacturing process. This paper describes some material tests necessary to building computer models that simulate the performance and processing of automobile parts. It presents studies WIDL successfully completed on behalf of suppliers to The big three 'in Canada and the United States. 2001-01-3071. Adaptive strain measurement for sheet metal stampings. Narasimhan (Nachu) Seshadri, S. Jack Hu, and Xin Wu, University of Michigan. In this paper, an adaptive strain methodology is developed for experimental strain measurement in sheet metal panels. The princi- ple involves etching uniform small square grids on the panel, and measuring strains adaptively from deformations of large squares comprising of many smaller grids. The methodology uses FEA pre- dicted strains as input and accounts for the experimental noise. The methodology overcomes the inability of the existing practice to simultaneously measure both low and high strain features, and in addition, saves considerable measurement time. The methodology is simple and can be easily integrated with automated strain mea- surement systems. The algorithm is distinguished for plane strain or radial symmetric panels whose strains vary along ID (one dimen- sion) and for other panel types whose strains vary along 2D (x and y). Correspondingly, the adaptive methodology is demonstrated for a hemispherical punch stretched and a box drawn panel. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3072. Friction and numerical simulation of stamp- ing. Mostafa El Mouatassim and Didier Nobile, Renault. The aim of the present document is to describe the system for restraining the metal sheet under the blank holder surface during stamping of a vehicle body part. This article attempts to link together the physical and digital aspects of the restraint system, closely associated with friction between the sheet and the tools. A description is given of the simulation method used to take account of friction and restraint. It distinguishes between the simula- tions performed prior to realization of the tools to assess the feasibil- ity of the product and process, and the adjustment simulations per- formed after realization of the tools, during try out. 2001-01-3073. Design binder cushion force curve using FEA. Rui Li and Wei Wang, Rouge Steel Company ; Maurice Lou, Ford Motor Company; andXianjin Wang, Univ. of Sci. &amp; Tech. Beijing. In stamping operation, the pinch between the upper die and the lower binder causes great kinetic impact. This may shorten the tool life and even damage the tool in some severe cases. Production experience proves that the impact can be significantly reduced if the binder cushion behavior is designed effectively. However, the design of this cushion movement is a very costly and time- consuming process, which involves excessive soft tool and hard tool try outs. This study is an effort to develop a numerical method to design and optimize the cushion force curve by using Finite Element Mod- eling technique. Binder displacement control, a widely used simula- tion setting, allows binder to be accelerated from zero to a certain velocity in no time, which means that the impact kinetic momentum is compensated quickly. Based on the binder force curve obtained from this 'ideal 'case, a cushion force is developed following the similar curve pattern. The simulation results indicate a significant improvement in reducing the impact effect without sacrificing the product quality. From dynamics point of view, completely absorbing the impact energy is impossible. However, to design a relatively optimized cushion behavior to minimize the impact damage is proved feasible in this paper and a numerical procedure to design the curve is estab- lished. The same methodology is extended to production panel sim- ulation at the end of the paper. 2001-01-3074. Stamping and crush performance of dual phase steel. X. M. Chen and J. J. Drouin, United States Steel ; and D. R. Coopmans, R. D. Dell'Osso, and P. J. Belanger, Daimler- Chrysler Corp. Traditionally, high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel is used for automotive vehicle weight reduction in the North American auto- motive industry. Dual-phase (DP) high-strength steel has gained great attention because it provides a combination of high strength and good formability. The main advantage of DP steel is the high ratio of tensile strength to yield strength, which provides more flexi- bility in stamping and higher energy absorption in a component crush event. This study compares the performances of DP and HSLA steel grades in stamping processes and component crush events, as shown in a typical automotive unibody inner rail. Simula- tion results show that DP steel offers more uniform strain distribu- tion, improved formability, and better crush performance than con- ventional HSLA steel. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3075. On formability assessment of the automotive dual phase steels. Aleksy A. Konieczny, United States Steel. The issue of improving car crash energy management and main- taining cost and weight reduction are the driving forces behind the growing use of advanced high-strength steels, particularly in Europe and Japan. Recent developments in the manufacture of high-strength steel (HSS) sheets in North America, in particular Dual-Phase (DP) steels, offers an attractive option to the automotive designer for weight reduction and improved safety performance. For example, the use of dual-phase steels, as opposed to more conventional steel 372</page><page sequence="372">2001-01-3075-2001-01-3083 products such as high-strength low alloys (HSLA), in some cases may result in up to 40% part weight reduction at similar vehicle crash performance. In this paper, the formability of commercially produced hot-dipped dual phase steels of various gages and grades is assessed. Forming Limit Curves (FLCs) are determined for com- mercial DP590 and DP780 grades. These FLCs were compared to the conventional ASM FLCs calculated from n-value and sheet thickness. Results show that the experimental FLCs for DP materi- als are located within a range of approximately -1.5% to +0.5% as compared to the calculated FLC. However, the overall shapes of the experimental curves are similar to the conventional ones. It has been found that for some testing conditions the experimental points are located significantly above the theoretical curve. Bake hardenability resulting from a typical paint baking temperature cycle are deter- mined for all tested DP materials. Bendability results are also presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3076. Glass-reinforcing transparent polycarbonate glazing. Kerry Kirwan and Gordon Smith , University of Warwick. This paper outlines a method of producing optically perfect transparent glass fiber pre-pregs. The technique uses a wetting resin in a sandwich construction with glass fibers; the construction pro- cess induces complete wetting of the fibers such that they are not visible in the resin. The transparent pre-pregs have subsequently been laid into a mold and back-injected with polycarbonate. Results show that com- ponents produced via this method exhibit flexural rigidity three times greater than unreinforced equivalent polycarbonate moldings. 2001-01-3077. Effect of solar reflective glazing on Ford Explorer climate control, fuel economy, and emissions. John P. Rugh and Terry J. Hendricks , National Renewable Energy Labora- tory ; and Kwaku Koram , PPG Industries. The energy used to air condition an automobile has a significant effect on vehicle fuel economy and tailpipe emissions. If a small reduction in energy use can be applied to many vehicles, the impact on national fuel consumption could be significant. The SC03 is a new emissions test conducted with the air conditioner (A/C) operat- ing that is part of the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP). With the 100% phase-in of the SFTP in 2004 for passenger cars and light light-duty trucks, there is additional motivation to reduce the size of the A/C system. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is investigating ways to reduce the amount of energy consumed for automobile climate con- trol. If the peak soak temperature in an automobile can be reduced, the power consumed by the air conditioner may be decreased while passenger comfort is maintained or enhanced. Solar reflective glass is one way to reduce the peak soak temperature. NREL and PPG Industries conducted a test program with Sungate®-laminated solar reflective glass installed in a Ford Explorer to quantify improve- ments in fuel economy and reductions in tailpipe emissions. Test results showed a dramatic reduction in interior and glass tempera- tures. After the A/C system and its effect on the passenger compart- ment were modeled to assess the potential reduction in compressor power, the vehicle performance was predicted. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3078. New applications of capacitive sensors in lami- nated automotive glass. Philip W. Kithil, Advanced Safety Con- cepts , Inc. Three applications of laminated glass-encapsulated capacitive sensors are described: occupant sensing for passenger airbag con- trol; rain sensing for improved driver vision; and supplemental crash discrimination sensors. Advantages and disadvantages are dis- cussed, and further development required to commercialize each application is outlined. 2001-01-3080. Development of automotive body solders. Tsung-Yu Pan , Howard D. Blair, and John M. Nicholson, Ford Motor Company ; and Alan E. Gickler, Johnson Manufacturing Company. Lead (Pb)-based solders had been used successfully as dent and seam fillers for automotive body panels and were commonly referred to as 'body solders. The usual compositions were 70wt% Pb - 30wt% Sn or 80wt% Pb -20wt% Sn. But due to the hazards associated with Pb dust and particles from the grinding and sanding, new lead-free body solders were developed in the early 80' s . An 82wt% Sn - 15wt% Cu - 3wt% Zn composition was developed to mimic the pasty characteristics and processability of the lead- containing solders. This body solder has the advantages of corrosion resistance, compatibility with e-coat, and a lower processing tem- perature and lower material cost than an alternative candidate approach that uses a silicon bronze material. The ideal temperature range for applying this solder is between 280 to 350°C, which pro- vides a workable, viscous material. This temperature range is much lower than the MIG welding temperature of the silicon bronze mate- rial and results in much less heat distortion of the steel panels. The microstructure is a dendritic structure with a Cu6Sn5 intermetallic compound in a Sn-rich matrix. The spacing of the dendrites can be reduced with a small addition of Fe. A zinc chloride (ZnC12) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl)-based flux or tinning paste is required to clean the oxide surface. Any residual flux residue was found to be fully compatible with the phosphate process in a paint compati- bility study. There appears to be great potential if such an automated process is implemented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3082. Steel battles plastic for fuel tank application: Forming - joining - corrosion resistance. Juergen Froeber, Hart- wig Roesen, and Ingo Wonneberger, Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG; Wil- helm Warnecke, Dortmunder Oberflaechencentrum GmbH; and Douglas W. Paul, and Gregory Tarrance, Magni-Group. Worldwide regulations for environmental issues are forcing the automotive industries to evaluate new materials for compliance. Future requirements for automotive recycling and stricter automo- tive emission standards are causing the industry to look for steel fuel tanks, which are inherently impermeable and 100% recyclable. Challenges to steel as a fuel tank material are to achieve a minimum of 15 years of corrosion life with a cost-effective product demon- strating weight and complex shapes comparable to plastic. The paper will discuss the impact of the future regulations on steel fuel tanks and the product actions what have been taken to meet these regulations. Specific data will be presented on the test and develop- ment of a pre-painted aluminized steel fuel tank material designed to exceed the 15-year corrosion life requirement. The paper will also discuss new manufacturing technologies like hydromechanical sheet forming (AHU®) and new joining technologies that allow to produce steel fuel tanks in complex shapes and to join emission tight seam welds. 2001-01-3083. Strength behavior of metal-to-metal and metal-to-composite joints. Keith Friedman, Don Ireland, and Paolo Feraboli, Friedman Research Corp. The use of composites in automotive applications necessarily leads to investigating the effects of attachment (joining) on the over- all strength of the new configuration. Traditional joining methods used for metal-to-metal (welding) and composite-to-composite are not directly applicable in metal-to-composite structures. A testing program was initiated to examine the relative strengths of typical roof structure-welded joints with alternative roof structure designs involving composites attached to metal by threaded fasteners. Fre- quently the attachment of a composite roof to the metal body of a vehicle includes the introduction of a gap joint with an intervening seal. Lap-shear testing was used to determine comparisons of rela- tive joint strength between the various methods. The results of this testing are presented. The use of threaded fasteners to attach com- 373</page><page sequence="373">200 1 -0 1 -3083-200 1 -0 1 -3090 posites to sheet metal was found to dramatically reduce the joint strength relative to the welding of metal-to-metal. The expected negative effects of attachment with gap joints and intervening seals were also confirmed by the results of this study. 2001-01-3084. Finite element methods for analyzing thermal deformation of large plastic components. Tadayoshi Takahara and Masahiro Mikami , Toyota Motor Co.; Jun Chen , BPA Inc.; and Yoshio Sugimoto, Kanto Auto Works , Ltd. In order to reduce the total vehicle development lead-time, one of the above authors has developed an analytical technology to quantitatively predict the thermal deformation of plastic compo- nents by taking into account the creep behavior. However, this tech- nology still needs to be improved to be generally applicable. Plastic characteristics were studied. It was discovered that the estimation error in FEM analysis of thermal deformation should be attributed to (1) creep dependence on stress state; (2) thermal shrink- age, which takes place when plastic component is exposed to ele- vated temperature. Then, computation methods are developed to take into account the two factors in FEM analysis. Verification and application exam- ples of the developed methods are reported. 2001-01-3085. External flow analysis over a car to study the influence of different body profiles using CFD. Paresh Patel and Srihari Vijayakumar , Kettering University. A vehicle's performance and fuel economy plays an important role in obtaining a larger market share in the segment. This can be best achieved by optimizing the aerodynamics of the vehicle. Aero- dynamics can be improved by altering the bodylines on a vehicle. Its drag coefficient can be maintained at a minimum value by prop- erly designing various component profiles. The stability of a vehicle and passenger comfort are affected by wind noise that is related to the aerodynamics of a vehicle. To study the effects of the above- mentioned parameters, the vehicle is tested inside a wind tunnel. In this paper, the authors study the body profile for different vehicles and analyze them using Computational Fluid Dynamics software - FLUENT. To study the influence of different body profiles on drag coefficient, 3 different vehicle segments are considered. This paper discusses the methodology followed, to test the vehicle models in a simulated environment and the physical parameters on the profiles are compared and analyzed. The author also discusses the type of algorithms used in solving the Navier-Stokes equation to obtain the results. Drag coefficient being one of the important parameters dur- ing design, is computed from the results. 2001-01-3086. Numerical simulation of airflow around the car body. Gu Zheng-qi , Jiang Le-hua, Wu Jun , and Luo Yu-feng , Hunan University. A numerical simulation system of airflow around the Car Body is introduced. It involves the basic equations, the application of FVM, the staggered grid system, and the dispose of boundary condi- tions and so on. In this paper, the application is given and the tech- nological treatments corresponding to the computation are also dis- cussed. The airflow around a test car model with no wheels is simu- lated and compare with experimental results in order to validate a simulation method of the flow field and the pressure distributions on the surface of the car. The calculation results and the experimen- tal results show reasonable agreement. 2001-01-3087. Application of modal transient dynamics to calculate body fatigue life.

Hot Metal Gas Forming is an innovative metal forming technique with the potential to leapfrog conventional metal forming tech- niques of structural steel components for automotive and aerospace industry. HMGF is an outgrowth of superplastic forming (SPF) and hot blow forming (HBF) techniques that the aerospace industry developed to form aluminum and titanium structures. The goal of this program is to develop the HMGF process and prove its produc- tion readiness for wide spread use in the Automotive and Aerospace industries. 2001-01-3089. Application of tubular hydroformed radiator support assembly to General Motors Corporation's new midsize SUVs. Chi-Mou Ni, General Motor Corporation ; Chi-Mou Ni, Peng, Te-Hui (Terry); and Chi-Mou Ni, General Motors Corpora- tion Asia &amp; Pacific Operation. This paper presents the product design &amp; development efforts to apply the tubular hydroformed radiator support structure assembly to General Motors Corporation's new SUVs. This represents that for the first time the space-frame type of structure assembly is used in integrated vehicle body application. The assembly is welded onto the front-end structure. By doing so, the body is greatly stiffened during the assembly process. Some benefits from this tubular design over the traditional stamped design have been realized. The product design started with all stamped radiator support assembly similar to the old design. As more and more styling, pack- aging, mass &amp; structural requirements come to play, the stamped design could not satisfy all these requirements. It was found that the most efficient structure design within tight space will be using tubu- lar structure, which can provide the largest section available by eliminating weld flanges (typically 20 mm). Going through several design iterations using one-piece lower tie-bar, two brackets (one for each side) for headlamp mounting, and one-piece upper tie-bar. The final production design, which consists of six pieces of hydro- formed components; all of them are welded together except the upper tie-bar, which is bolted on its extensions and can be removed for service need. The complete assembly is welded to the upper rails in the body assembly. The considerations of the component forma- bility &amp; assembly efficiency play very important roles during the product design process. As an example, only three hydroforming dies are required to make those six pieces of components. One for the U-shaped lower tie-bar, one for those two vertical pieces (cut from one hydroformed tube), &amp; the third one is for the upper tie-bar with its two extension pieces. The upper tie-bar is hydroformed together with its extensions as one piece. Both ends of the upper tie- bar are partially smashed &amp; completely smashed in the hydroform- ing process. A mechanical shear is used to trim the ends of the upper tie-bar and then it is flipped over and bolted on its two extension pieces. By doing so, the matching conjugate features from hydro- forming at the joints provide improved joint stiffness. In addition, all the hole piercings are done in the hydroforming dies. In summary, this new tubular hydroformed radiator support structure has provided us some benefits over the traditional stamped design both in product performances and manufacturing efficiency. 2001-01-3090. Use of FEA for design of part, process and tooling in the metal forming processes - Hydroforming as a case study. Muammer Koę (Koch), Sevenkom, Engineering Services. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been proven to be a useful tool in recent decades for simulation of manufacturing processes to obtain reliable and precise information about the process, geometry and material parameters. For the tube hydroforming process, analy- sis of thinning, strain, and stress distribution on a deformed tube would determine the feasibility of forming a specific part. More- over, the effects of different parameters can be investigated by vary- ing important dimensions or loading conditions on common part and feature types. Hence, generic rules can be established for future problems. Optimized loading paths can be obtained by using adap- 374</page><page sequence="374">2001-01-3090-2001-01-3101 ti vely controlled FEA techniques. In this paper, FE Analysis of vari- ous hydroform parts with varying complexity is presented. Compar- isons of predictions with experimental measurements show good correlations for the models and used parameters. Results of this study can be further applied to eliminate defects, optimize process parameters, and predict die stresses for preventing premature die failure for similar cases. 2001-01-3091. Formability improvement for TWB using drawbead design. Sijun He, The University of Michigan; Xin Wu, Wayne State University ; and S. Jack Hu, The University of Michi- gan. In recent years the use of tailor-welded blanks (TWB) has grown significantly, but there still exists serious concern on the poor for- mability in the stamping of TWB, which is commonly considered to relate to the uncertainty in the weld line movement. This paper proposes a drawbead design methodology to achieve weld line movement control. Based on the properties, geometries and frictions of base-metals constituting the TWB, the magnitudes and ratio of drawbead restraining force (DBRF) between the two sides of the base metal sheets across the weld line, which is the function of drawbead depth, can be determined for minimizing the weld-line movement and enhancing TWB formability. In the case of 2D strip drawing with TWB, lower restraining force should be used in the side of thicker base metal to reduce weld line movement. Computer simulations and experiments were conducted to verify the weld line movement control strategy and the drawbead design, and to demon- strate the formability improvement. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3092. Tailored hybrid blanks in steel and aluminum. H. Pircher, Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG; A. Mertens, Thyssen Fiige- technik GmbH; R. Polzin, Thyssen Laser -Technik GmbH; A. Segala, Centro Sviluppo Materiali S.p.A.; and B. Wilkinson, ThyssenKrupp Steel North America, Inc. Thyssen Tailored Hybrid Blanks (THB) are cold-formable com- binations of steel and aluminum sheets. They include linear lap joints fabricated by means of a laser-assisted roll bonding technique. The initial development work has meanwhile progressed to the stage where a pilot line is set to start up operation and fabricate hybrid blanks in shapes and sizes required for automotive engineering applications. The present state of development, a possible spectrum of prod- ucts, and main process parameters are discussed. Research into the forming behavior of hybrid blanks is looked at, citing practical examples, added with findings from metallographic analyses and corrosion testing. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3094. Crashworthiness and spot weldability of galvannealed DP800 steel sheet. M. Kamura, Y. Utsumi, Y. Omiya, and Y. Kawamoto , Kobe Steel Ltd. In this study, to confirm the practical advantages and acceptabil- ity of galvannealed TS800MPa grade dual-phase steel (DP800), crashworthiness and spot weldability as important properties in practical use were investigated and compared with conventional galvannealed TS440MPa grade and microalloyed TSóOOMPa grade steels, which are currently used for frame parts. The results have shown that DP800 has high absorbed energy on crash tests, and has almost the same acceptable weldability as comparative steels. 2001-01-3098. Evaluation of vehicle body stiffness and strength for car to car compatibility. Yuichi Kitagawa and Chin- moy Pal, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. When considering a CTC (car-to-car) frontal crash between a small light car and a large heavy car, it is necessary to evaluate the stiffness and strength of each vehicle body. As interactive force at the contact surface cannot be measured directly in a car-to-car crash test, a simplified practical method has been developed to estimate the interactive force based on the vehicle deceleration. The ade- quacy and consistency of the proposed method was verified by using the principle of conservation of energy. The calculated force- deformation curves revealed that the interactive force reached the maximum designed strength of the small light car based on the ODB (Offset Deformable Barrier) test for crash protection, while the force level was far below the corresponding design limit of the large heavy car. It was observed that the relatively lower stiffness of the small light car resulted in absorbing a larger share of the total input energy of the system when crashed into the large heavy car. By ana- lyzing the interactive force profile in detail, it was found that the maximum impact force and the end of crash force could be used as a barometer to assess car to car crash compatibility. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3099. Vehicle crash performance augmentation through SEM (solid ejection material) shock isolation. Stephen E. Knotts, Paragrate. There is a new crash energy absorption technology, currently under development that adds a whole new design option for the vehicle designers, so that they can improve a vehicle's crash perfor- mance, in both low- and high-speed impacts. This new technology is known as SEM (Solid Ejection Material) shock isolation. The basic restraint mechanism of this technology is the high pressure loading that is needed to initiate the flow of plastics or elastomers. Therefore, the crash energy absorption is the result of the very high work energies that are needed to expel these polymers (e.g. W=(F)(d), F»l, del). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3100. Enhancement of offset crash performance in a short carrier front suspension vehicle. Chul-kee Hong and Dong-Seok Kim, Daewoo Motor Co., Ltd. The offset crash performance of a vehicle is getting important in reducing occupant injuries in a high-speed frontal collision on real road. To enhance the performance, we have to keep the passenger compartment space and distribute a half side load to a whole vehicle body structure. In this point of view, a cradle-type front-wheel car- rier system can be very effective. But it poses a little difficulty in using various engine and transmission combinations. But a short wheel carrier system provides a flexible engine room package even though it has a conceptual weakness to offset crash protection. The wheel carrier connecting bar supporting between a short wheel car- rier and a radiator supporting cross member is suggested. Two offset crash test modes (Euro NCAP, IIHS) are simulated for developing the wheel carrier connecting bar and modifying the vehicle body structure. The IIHS test results show the enhancement effect, which increase the structural grade from 'MARGINAL' to upper 'ACCEPTABLE.' 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3101. A comparison of the response of HSLA and dual-phase sheet steel in dynamic crush. James R. Fekete and Anne M. Stibich, General Motors Corp.; and Ming F. Shi, United States Steel. Continuing pressure to reduce mass and cost of vehicles is driv- ing the development of new high-strength steel products with improved combinations of strength and formability. Galvanized, cold-rolled dual-phase steel products are new alternatives to conven- tional high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel for strength-limited applications in vehicles. These steels have higher tensile strengths than HSLA products with nearly equivalent formability. This paper compares the performance of HSLA and dual-phase sheet steel products in a series of drop tower tests. Samples were prepared by stamping the steel sheets into typical rail-type parts using a production-intent die process. The parts were sectioned, and subsequently fabricated into hat-shaped assemblies that were then dynamically crushed by a drop weight. The experiments were designed such that the entire energy input by the drop weight was absorbed by the samples. 375</page><page sequence="375">2001-01-3101-2001-01-3110 Results discussed in the paper include comparisons of the forces and total displacements measured during the tests. The results are presented as direct comparisons of energy absorption among the materials, as well as through correlation with mechanical properties. The results lead to the conclusion that dual-phase steel absorbs approximately 10% more energy per unit mass than HSLA steel with similar yield strength and formability, and that energy absorp- tion scales with the tensile strength of the sheet product. 2001-01-3102. Magnesium alloys and process developments for space-frame-concepts. Fr.-W. Bach , H. Haferkamp , M. Nie- meyer, and J. -F. Lass , University of Hanover. At the Institute of Materials Science, University of Hanover in Germany, current research work is dealing with magnesium alloy development and modification for Space-Frame-Concepts in the automobile industry. At the moment several problems impede such a realization with magnesium similar to the Aluminum-Space- Frame-Concept of Audi. Extruded magnesium alloys have a marked anisotropy concerning the position of the load to the extrusion direc- tion as well as a concise tensile-compressive anisotropy. This article will give a small insight about the level of this research work and its development. Here possible solution attempts on the basis of commercial standard alloys are shown which do not only take into account the alloy modification but particularly also includes the materials processing for the production of extruded components. 2001-01-3103. Elevated temperature formability of some engineering metals for gas forming of automotive structures. X. Wu, H. Hao, Y. Liu , F. Zhu , J. Jiang , R. Krishnamurthy, and S. Wang , Wayne State University ; P. E . Smith , Alcoa Tech Center; W. Bland ', LTV-Copperweld ; and G. D. Pfaffmann, TOCCO Inc. This paper provides a preliminary study on tensile behavior and formability of some engineering magnesium and aluminum alloys, and steels at elevated temperatures (&gt;0.6 Tm) and high strain rates (&gt;0.1/s). A new elevated-temperature biaxial formability testing technique is developed to study strain path dependence as well as temperature and strain rate dependence. The formability test and in- die forming process are simulated with FEA method, and a concept of forming process diagram is established. The technical feasibility of elevated temperature gas forming for automotive components is discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3104. Elevated temperature forming of sheet magne- sium alloys. Paul E. Krajewski , General Motors Research and Development Center. The use of sheet magnesium for automobile body applications is limited, in part, due to its low room temperature formability. Ele- vated temperature forming of magnesium sheet could enable the manufacture of automobile body closure and structural panels to meet vehicle mass targets. The effect of temperature in improving the formability of sheet magnesium has been known since the 1940's; however, automobile applications for sheet magnesium still have been very limited. The present work characterizes the elevated temperature mechanical behavior of commercially available magne- sium sheet alloys at temperatures between 300°C and 500°C. The materials are then evaluated using both warm forming and super- plastic forming technologies. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3106. An experimental study of springback for dual phase steel and conventional high strength steel. Aleksy A. Kon- ieczny and Ming F. Shi , United States Steel; and Chongqing Du, DaimlerChrysler. An experimental study of springback was conducted for a hat channel section with varying cross sections and controlled gap between punch and die. The channel section was formed in a single step forming process with upper pressure pad. DP590 steel was compared to a group of high-strength steels (HSS), e.g., HSLA270, 340 and 420. In addition, sidewall curl phenomenon was studied uti- lizing bending under tension test. This paper describes methodology of experiment and discusses springback related results. It also offers recommendations that can be applied to die-punch gap control or material substitution situations. The results of this investigation can be used to verify accuracy of springback predictions in finite ele- ment analysis (FEA). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3108. Predicted versus actual compensation in a stamping die. Kenneth E. Rosink and Thomas Reynolds, Daimler- Chrysler; and Timothy Morris, Fine Points Inc. Traditional methods used to produce a die set (from developing initial machining cutter paths through finalized die tryout to produce a part that meets design intent) begin with draw simulation and development. It is here, traditionally, that scientific evaluation of actual metal stretch and theoretical ideals end. In past programs, a designed part would be simulated for stretch and a development model created to include various die compensa- tions (i.e., springback, overcrown, etc.) based on past experience for area and amount. At this point, the die is cut and undergoes a meta- morphosis through die tryout to finally produce a quality part. This is currently an open-loop system. This paper will focus on the differences in the predicted way the die should look and the actual outcome (after part buyoff). We will document the original 'plan' (compensation areas and amounts), the resulting development model, supporting data of the initial cut die and the differences between the die at original cut and at final part buyoff. This will create a closed-loop system. We will also show how this data can be used to regenerate a new development model and new cutter path for the purpose of creating a second set of dies. This information may also be used as a bench- mark or a 'zero point' to which the die may be restored after wear. This will also provide a database, which can be used to expedite future die development, by knowing the die surface required to pro- duce a quality part at the production source. 2001-01-3109. CAE math-based flange fitting analysis. Thomas Oetjens, General Motors Corporation North America Engi- neering. A CAE NASTRAN-based analysis along with General Motors Corporation internal software provides the capability to morph math surfaces that represent the clamped state of components in a weld station. These surfaces can clearly show the interference and gaps between mating flanges. Section plots are the method of detecting and dimensioning the weld mismatch. The sheet metal die changes for fitting the flanges together and correcting excessive weld flange gaps or interference are determined. Another morphed CAD model of the corrected stamping shape is sent to the die plant for guiding the die changes. 2001-01-3110. Crash pulse prediction via inverse filtering. Matthew Huang and Raj Jayachandran, Ford Motor Company. This paper reports a study on the use of response inverse filtering (RIF) methodology for crash pulse prediction. RIF is based on the finite impulse response (FIR) and inverse filtering (IF) methods. The FIR coefficients obtained by the digital convolution theory and the least-squared error approach serve to transfer response from the input (impacting or excitation) side to the output (non-impacting or receiving) side. The FIR method, a process of low pass filtering (e.g., truck body mount), is commonly used in predicting the non-impacting side (e.g., truck body or cab) response with the input excitation in the impacting side (e.g., truck frame). The accuracy in the validation and prediction via FIR transfer function depends on the frequency contents of the input and output accelerometer data from which the transfer function is developed. The prediction accuracy is low if the output data contain higher frequency components than the input. Taking advantage of this FIR forward prediction accuracy, the 376</page><page sequence="376">2001-01-3110-2001-01-3121 method of inverse filtering is thus utilized to develop the RIF for the backward prediction. The new RIF transfer function is created by the IF matrix opera- tions applied to the FIR forward transfer function. The accuracy of RIF in predicting the high frequency output (such as frame impulse) with the low frequency input (such as body excitation) has been shown to be high. In crash development of a vehicle, this technique is useful in crash pulse prediction. One of the applications in predict- ing the truck frame pulse based on a desired body pulse is described in details. 2001-01-3111. Mode-controlling approach on multi-level optimization for crash safety design of vehicle. Qiang Yu and Naoki Adachi, Yokohama National University; Hideoki Yajima, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Masaki Shiratori , Yokohama National University. It is important to improve the deceleration characteristic and the cabin deformation for a collision safety design of vehicle. At the same time it is required to reduce the vehicle weight to satisfy the driving performance and environmental restriction. Therefore there is a strong demand to develop an optimization approach to design a safer and lighter vehicle. The authors have proposed a Statistical Design Support System (SDSS), and brought forward that the SDSS is one of the available optimal approaches for the nonlinear and dynamic phenomena. In this study, they proposed a new concept called as mode controlling approach to keep the side members in ideal buckling mode. As a result, it was shown that high deceleration performance and light body can be realized by using this approach and SDSS. 2001-01-3112. Crash worthiness improvement of the side crash by the work-hardening effect of pre-strained high- strength steel. Hiroshi Yoshida , Akihiro Uenishi, Yukihisa Kuri- yama, and Manabu Takahashi, Nippon Steel Corp. In order to examine the compatibility of improvement of crash- worthiness with weight saving of automobiles by using high- strength steel, a combination analysis of Finite Element Method and Dynamic Mechanical Properties has been established. Material properties used in this analysis have been measured by 'one bar method' high- velocity tensile tests, which can examine the deforma- tion behavior of materials at a bend crush speed range (~55km/h). It was confirmed that the strength of steel measured by one bar method was raised remarkably after press and hydro forming of high-strength steels. It was also confirmed by FEM analysis and load drop test that absorbed energy of bend crush was improved by pre-strain effect. Further, we proved that absorbed energy of bend crush was also improved by appropriate design of thickness and the ratio of bend span and plate length. These effects are applicable to respective high-strength steels. 2001-01-3113. Development of safe child restraints system for FMVSS 225 using CAE. Kaushlendra Singh , Qutub Khaja, and Nammalwar Purushothaman, Ford Motor Company. Federal Motor Safety Standard (FMVSS) 225 establishes requirements for child restraint anchorage systems to ensure their proper location and strength for the effective securing of child restraints, to reduce the likelihood of the anchorage systems failure and to increase the likelihood that child restraints are properly secured and thus more fully achieve their potential effectiveness in motor vehicles. Current CAE simulations are focused on evaluating localized structural strength by applying the loads as vectors to the child tether anchorages to approximate the loading. This method cannot be used to determine the displacement requirements of child tether that was added recently to FMVSS 225 specifications. A new CAE proce- dure that takes into account the effect of seat structure and belt sys- tem has been developed and successfully applied to truck programs. This paper discusses in detail the CAE simulation of the FMVSS 225 test for checking the child tether anchorages structural integrity and displacements of load application point on child seat fixture. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3114. Assembly variation analysis of flexible parts. R. Ilankamban and S. Alluri, Ford Motor Company. Build variation is an important aspect of vehicle assembly. How- ever traditional variation analysis assumes parts are rigid, leading to overestimation of variations. A finite element analysis procedure to estimate the build variation due to variations of shape, size and mechanical properties of flexible parts is presented. In addition to the part deformation, assembly force and stress can also be calcu- lated by this method. This procedure is illustrated with an example problem. 2001-01-3116. Advanced high-strength steels and hydro- forming reduce mass and improve dent resistance of lightweight doors in ultralight steel auto closures project. Marcel van Schaik, American Iron and Steel Institute. In May 2000, the UltraLight Steel Auto Closure (ULSAC) Con- sortium unveiled a lightweight frameless steel door design that achieves 42 percent weight savings over the average benchmarked (1997 model year vehicles) frameless door and 22 percent savings over the lightest benchmark, a framed door. ULSAC was commis- sioned by this international consortium of 3 1 sheet steel producers to assist their automotive customers with viable lightweighting steel solutions. The ULSAC design and engineering team, Porsche Engi- neering Services, Inc. (PES), Troy, Michigan USA, accomplished this significant weight savings by using high and ultra-high- strength steels, combined with technologies such as tailored blanks and hydroforming. The door outer panel of this first round of demonstra- tion hardware is made of stamped 0.7 mm Bake Hardenable (BH) 260 sheet steel. During the design and development of the ULSAC frameless door, the ULSAC Consortium evaluated further mass reduction, using sheet hydroforming for the door outer. Consequently, the ULSAC Validation Phase continued beyond May 2000 with sheet hydroforming process development for the door outer as a means to compile practical research documentation for this developmental process with mass reduction potential. Door structures were suc- cessfully manufactured with 0.6 mm Dual Phase (DP) 600 hydrofor- med steel outer panels achieving additional weight savings. 2001-01-3120. (P-364) SAE J2430 Recommended Practice and its application for characterizing aftermarket brake friction material effectiveness. Jim Trainor, J.T. Trainor &amp; Associates Inc.; and Tim Duncan and Carlos E. Agudelo, Link Testing Laboratories, Inc. The purpose of this paper is to describe the background and uses of the SAE J2430 Recommended practice for Dynamometer Effec- tiveness Test and the use of the BMC guidelines to characterize aftermarket friction material products as an advancement over the regular SAE J661 test, support the BMC resolution that aftermarket brake friction materials should not deteriorate vehicle performance below the applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. 2001-01-3121. (P-364) Standardized testing of friction mate- rials with special emphasis on commercial vehicles. Robert A. Emmett, Federal Mogul Friction Products GmbH. Over the last 10 years, the automotive supply industry, has had to contend with increasing global price pressures and a trend towards reduced 'time to market.' Consequently, Friction Material Manufacturers, in Europe, have been working with the Brake and Vehicle manufacturers to try to develop a rationalized procedure for Product Design, Development and Production Supervision. A common test specification for passenger car friction materials, the 'Global Spec. 'has been created. 377</page><page sequence="377">2001-01-3121-2001-01-3131 This Paper discusses a proposal for a similar 'Global Spec.' for Commercial Vehicles. The background and structure are discussed, together with the logic behind the programs selected and the regularity of testing. The Paper goes on to discuss some of the special test require- ments of CVs and to propose some possibilities for yet further rationalization. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Commercial Vehicles 2001-01-3123. (P-364) Lining selection with surrogate brakes. Yongbin Yuan , TRW Chassis Systems. Due to the dependence of friction on speed, pressure and temper- ature at the sliding interface, the same friction material exhibits varying friction characteristics in different brakes. For this reason, lining selection is typically carried out with design-intent brakes to capture the true behavior of friction materials. However, doing so necessitates prototype brakes and entails a long lead-time and high development costs. This paper explores the feasibility of conducting friction, fade, and wear tests on brake dynamometers with readily available surro- gate brakes. Both analytical scaling principles and experimental results are presented and discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3126. (P-364) Animations of a disc brake generating noise. Chris Talbot and John D. Fieldhouse, The University ofHud- dersfield. Previous work on generating animations from real disc brake systems generating noise (squeal) has been consolidated and devel- oped. Using the method of double pulsed laser interferometry a series of holograms (typically ten per half cycle) can be recorded from the brake during a cycle of excitation. From these holograms a considerable amount of data can be obtained about the vibration of the disc and pad surfaces. Standard methods from image process- ing and algorithms developed to investigate hologram fringe lines can be used to generate three-dimensional representations of the sur- faces. Furthermore although part of the disc surface and even more of the pad surface are obscured by the calliper, etc., it has been pos- sible to form a reliable numerical reconstruction of the whole disc and pad surfaces partly by using standard mathematical approxima- tion techniques and partly by intelligent extrapolation of the avail- able data. From these an extension of previous animations to show the full disc and pad surfaces undergoing vibration can be obtained. Using a Fourier analysis of the numerical data indicates a possible way to construct reliable mathematical models of real disc brake systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3127. (P-364) Modified phenolic resins for high- performance friction applications. Shinichi Ozeki, Sumitomo Bakelite Co ., Ltd. Phenolic resins have been widely used as binders for Friction Materials. Increased performance requirements have driven the improvement of phenolic resins. Phenolic resins modified with sili- cone gel, NBR, and aromatic compounds were presented at the 18th ANNUAL BRAKE COLLOQUIUM &amp; EXHIBITION in 2000, their performance levels and capabilities were described. As market demands increase, enhanced phenolic resins as bind- ers are needed to provide high performance friction products with superior heat resistance and noise properties. This presentation will review the following resins: -PR-ANP- 50LB (a high resistant resin) its heat resistance has been greatly improved compared with the resin presented last year. -PR-54365 (acrylic rubber modified resin) providing excellent flexibility and vibration absorption. -PR-EPN (gas free resin) is able to reduce fre- quency of gas venting during molding frictions, thus shortening the molding time. These resins will be presented along with detailed performance data including wear, friction coefficients, Rockwell hardness, flex- ural modulus, dynamic viscoelasticity and vibration absorption. 2001-01-3128. (P-364) The biopersistence and pathogenicity of man-made vitreous fibers. Ole Kamstrup, Lapinus Fibers BV. A summary is given of the pathology results after long-term tests (inhalation and injection into the abdominal cavity) in rats of a Man- made Vitreous Fiber (HT) representing the new biosoluble types. The biosoluble fiber type, HT, is characterized by a relatively high content of aluminum and a relatively low content of silica compared to the traditional stone wool (MMVF21). HT has a high in- vitro dissolution rate at pH 4.5 and a relatively low dissolution rate at pH 7.4. In a short-term inhalation study the HT fiber was considerably less biopersistent/more biosoluble than MMVF21 and other MMVFs. In accordance with the high biosolu- bility of HT in long-term inhalation studies MMVF21 caused pul- monary fibrosis, but the HT fiber did not. For both fiber types the incidence of tumors was comparable to the control groups. Also in injection studies the importance of the high biosolubility of HT was confirmed, because MMVF21 caused a significant increase of mesotheliomas in the abdominal cavity while the HT fiber exposed rats did not show any mesotheliomas. Due to the results from biopersistence and long-term studies the HT fiber type is exonerated from any carcinogen classification by EU and German regulation. The introduction of the HT fiber type has increased the safety margins in manufacturing and use of Man- made Vitreous Fibers. 2001-01-3129.

(P-364) The role of raw material ingredients of brake linings on the formation of transfer film and friction char- acteristics. Min Hyung Cho, Eun Gap Bae , and Ho Jang , Korea University ; and Geunjoong Jeong, Daehwan Kim , and Chunrak Choi , Hankook Tire Co. An NAO friction material (low-steel type) containing 15 ingredi- ents was investigated to study the role of transfer film on the coeffi- cient of friction, friction oscillation, and fade resistance. The friction material specimens containing extra 100% of each ingredient were tested using a pad-on-disk type tribotester. A non-destructive method of measuring the transfer film was developed by considering the electrical resistance of the transfer film. Results showed that solid lubricants and iron powder assisted transfer film formation on the rotor surface and abrasive ingredients tended to remove the film. No apparent relationship between transfer film thickness and the average friction coefficient was found in this experiment. Fade resistance was also found to be independent of the transfer film thickness when the stable film was formed on the rotor surface at elevated temperatures. On the other hand, the transfer film on the rotor surface reduced the amplitude of friction oscillation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3131. (P-364) Multi-body dynamic simulation for the evaluation of disc brake slide force. Richard A. Swift and Michael Walmsley, Bosch Automotive Chassis. Common problems associated with the design and utilization of disc brakes often relate to the effects of caliper slide force. Exces- sive slide force can result in off-braking pad to rotor contact that exacerbates disc thickness variation (DTV) growth, causes acceler- ated lining wear, and in extreme cases, can result in 'caliper binding. 'This condition, where the caliper housing has 'locked in place, 'can result in extremely high brake drag. To identify the key physical parameters that affect slide force magnitude, a multibody dynamic 378</page><page sequence="378">2001-01-3131-2001-01-3137 model of a complete disc brake was constructed and a design of experiments (DOE) was performed. The DOE explored the relation- ship of slide force to ten independent dimensional tolerances, and accounts for the relative motion of components that occurs during assembly. Trends and key physical attributes are identified for the geometric tolerances considered. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3132. (P-364) Disc brake caliper system modeling. Jiye Zhao , Yeujin Li, and Stefan Anger, PBR International Pty Ltd. This paper illustrates the application of the most advanced CAE tools in the modeling and simulation of disc brake caliper system as an assembly. The modeling strategy, correlation with bench deflection and strain gauge measurement are presented. The ability of modeling disc brake system as an assembly and simulating brake application offers tremendous advantages over the traditional com- ponent level modeling in determining component interaction, load path and load transfer and in obtaining more accurate performance characteristics, strength and durability. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3133. (P-364) Micromechanical modeling of friction materials. A. K. Hildred, P. C. Brooks, and D. C. Barton, University of Leeds; and R. Whitaker, TMD Friction UK. Important constituents contained within modern friction materi- als include a variety of particles, fibers and fillers (collectively termed 'inclusions') that are added to give desired frictional charac- teristics to the baseline matrix material. The proposed paper presents the results of a microscopy study which has utilized image enhance- ment software to measure and evaluate the raw constituents of a typ- ical friction material in terms of size, shape and aspect ratio of inclu- sions. This characterization has been extended to determine the sta- tistical distribution of constituent inclusions over the working inter- face after pad manufacture, as well as to measure the degree of inclusion exposure above the free surface. Experimental tests on the binder system (matrix material plus matrix fillers) have also been undertaken to characterize the thermo-mechanical properties at ambient and elevated temperature. A finite element analysis proce- dure has been developed to estimate the normal stiffness properties of an embedded particle for different inclusion properties as well as for different levels of exposure above the nominal rubbing surface. This unit cell model has been developed further to determine the transverse load carrying characteristics of the embedded hard parti- cle. Information from the experimental characterisation combined with data from the unit cell model has led to the development of a 'multi-component' numerical approach to assess the load bearing and frictional characteristics of the interface. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3134. (P-364) An analytical assessment of rotor dis- tortion attributed to wheel assembly. Thomas Valvano, Mike Martyniak, and Kevin Weber, Delphi Automotive Systems. The lateral runout of disc brake corner components can lead to the generation of brake system pulsation. Emphasis on reducing component flatness and lateral runout tolerances are a typical response to address this phenomenon. This paper presents the results of an analytical study that examined the effect that the attachment of the wheel to the brake corner assembly could have on the lateral distortion of the rotor. An analysis procedure was developed to uti- lize the finite element method and simulate the mechanics of the assembly process. Calculated rotor distortions were compared to laboratory measurements. A statistical approach was utilized, in conjunction with the finite element method, to study a number of wheel and brake corner parameters and identify the characteristics of a robust design. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3135. (P-364) An experimental investigation of hot judder. John D. Fieldhouse and Carl Beveridge, The University of Huddersfield. High-speed testing of a brake system using two different calipers and two different discs on a special test rig with a swinging caliper head mounting shows similar results with regard to hot judder. Holographic interferometry is used in an attempt to observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary infor- mation was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a perma- nent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode forma- tion. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder - the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the caliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the caliper body. The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A 'strobing 'effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes 'just off' the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc center. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing end of the pads with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface. Other observations include hot spotting on the disc surface and a surface scan of the disc face indicates a depression at these posi- tions. A metallurgical analysis of the blue spot is currently being carried out to determine if a material phase change has occurred within the disc body and this will be included in the paper. The introduction of a pressure fluctuation absorber shows an improvement in the pressure amplitude and subsequent vibration signal and the possible development of this system is discussed. 2001-01-3136. (P-364) First order analysis of low-frequency disk brake squeal. Yoshitomo Denou and Masaaki Nishiwaki, Toyota Motor Corp. Reducing disk brake squeal, especially low-frequency disk brake squeal (l-5kHz), is an important technical issue in vehicles. The disk brake squeal mechanism has been shown in many papers. Recently, the disk brake squeal comes to be simulated by Finite Ele- ment Analysis (FEA) for disk brake design. Though FEA is useful, it is sometimes difficult to modify in large when the prototype of disk brake system has been designed. First Order Analysis gives design concepts, which should be done before FEA. This paper shows First Order Analysis of low-frequency disk brake squeal. The equation of motion is shown in 4-degrees-of-freedom model. In this equation the generalized force matrix is composed of the variations of pressure and friction force between each brake pad and brake disk. The generalized force matrix is arranged with a symmetric matrix and an anti-symmetric matrix. Anti- symmetric matrix some- times causes the dynamic instability, which represents disk brake squeal generation. This paper shows the stabilization of the system with making it symmetric, and gives the design concept for reducing low frequency disk brake squeal. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3137. (P-364) Analysis for reducing low-frequency squeal of disc brake. Yoichi Kumemura and Yoshikazu Gamo, Tokico Ltd.; and Kimiyasu Kono and Satoru Suga, Tokico Giken Ltd. The phenomenon of low-frequency squeal of disc brake occurs only under special conditions and the occurrence rate is very small compared to high-frequency squeal. Therefore it is difficult to simu- late and reproduce the squeal by bench test. There was no method established for evaluating and reducing the low-frequency squeal before this paper. The detail methodology of the experimental anal- ysis and Finite Element Modeling utilized to solve this problem in a short time frame is discussed in this paper. First, the squeal that occurred on the vehicle must be simulated and reproduced on a labo- ratory bench by all means as an evaluation tool, so that the counter- measure for the squeal can be evaluated by the tool. In this example, 379</page><page sequence="379">2001-01-3137-2001-01-3150 a new bench test was successfully implemented from the vehicle conditions that generated the squeal. Second, the vibration mode of the squeal was estimated by an experimental oscillation test with disc brake assembly to identify key components for FEM analysis. The vibration mode of the carrier being fixed to the steering knuckle was analyzed with FEM. Through multiple geometry modifications of the carrier with knuckle FE model, one revised geometry was found to be effective to reduce the squeal phenomenon. Finally, the carrier with revised geometry model was then tested by the labora- tory bench test with successful reduction of the low-frequency disc squeal. In conclusion, the combined use of laboratory bench testing and FEM modeling significantly reduced the solution time for low- frequency squeal of disc brake. 2001-01-3138. (P-364) Influence of friction law on brake creep-groan. J. Brecht, TMD Friction GmbH; and K. Schiffner, University of Siegen. Brake creep-groan has been the center of attention for several years within the brake industry, since it has a negative impact on the sense of comfort of the driver. It consists of vibrations in the fre- quency range between 20-200 Hz, which occurs especially on vehi- cles with automatic transmission when moving off, and is perceived in the passenger compartment as a noticeable buzz. The mechanism of this effect was extensively discussed by SCHIFFNER, K.; BRECHT, J. (1999). This demonstrated that brake creep-groan is based on the stick-slip effect and that the friction couple carry out complex movements during the alternate adhesion and friction. The presented test is based on the available findings and consists of two modules: the first module describes a process for precise measurement of the friction law during transition from the state of adhesion to friction; the second module consists of a simplified mechanical multi-body model to describe the interaction between the friction combinations. By correlating the measured friction law with the results of road tests, a hypothesis is developed to explain the effect of the friction material on brake creep-groan. This hypothesis is discussed at length with the aid of the second module, the multi-body model. It is initially shown that during creep-groan, by comparison to the classic stick-slip idea, instead of a mechanical system, two partial systems are involved in the vibrations. The first system consists of the wheel brake system, the second system consists of the compo- nents of the drive train (drive/brake disc). Both systems are linked together by the friction force and the brake actuating force. The required vibration energy is produced via the driving torque. Possi- ble solutions are finally derived which should help to avoid brake creep-groan. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3140. (P-364) Prediction of damper effects in a brake system model. Lezza Mignery, Material Sciences Corporation ; and Jishen Wang and Jim Luo, TRW Incorporated. Analytical methods have been developed to determine equivalent material properties of brake dampers for their inclusion in a system model. A multi-layered model of a damper is reduced to a single- layer model. The material properties for this single-layer model are determined from a simulation of a bench-top, damper/shoe/lining impact modal test. Two different dampers are considered. The damper's response is confirmed by experimental results. A com- plex-eigenvalue analysis is then presented to show the effect the two brake dampers have on the braking system. Conditions of the eigen- value analysis were set to match noise events in a squeal rig test. The eigenvalue analysis shows a stabilization of the braking system with the equivalent damper models. The results are confirmed with dynamometer testing. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3141. (P-364) A study on the reduction of disc brake squeal using complex eigenvalue analysis. Choonki Park, Min Gyu Han, and Sung Sun Cho, Mando Corporation ; and Hyoung Gil Choi, Ji Deok Jeong, and Moo Lee Jang, Seoul National University. In this paper, we investigate a method to calculate the dynamic instability of a disc brake system and propose a criterion of design modification. To estimate dynamic instability, complex eigenvalue analysis is performed for a brake system and the contribution factor of each component to an unstable complex mode is calculated using complex MAC (Modal Assurance Criteria). From the contribution factors, the most influential component is determined so as to decouple the complex mode, and its geometry is modified in view of the strain energy distribution. Evaluation through noise dyna- mometer tests verifies the reduction of squeal noises, and this is in accordance with the results of complex eigenvalue analysis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3142. (P-364) Simulation of aircraft brake vibration using flexible multibody and finite element methods to guide component testing. Todd E. Rook, J. John Enright, Shyam Kumar, and Ramesh Balagangadhar, Goodrich Corporation. Brake-induced vibration often involves strong coupling with the aircraft structure, thereby necessitating a system level understand- ing. However, testing a full system is both costly and impossible until late in the development cycle. To overcome these issues, it becomes necessary to utilize simulation tools to assess the system behavior at an earlier stage. This paper demonstrates a methodology which implements such simulations to guide appropriate brake com- ponent tests that are more tractable for the brake supplier. As a result of this combined simulation and testing, a reduction in actual testing can be achieved. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3143. (P-364) Correlating dynamometer and vehicle brake test results: Brake squeal. Harald Abendroth and Uwe Sch- warz , Honeywell Friction Materials. Brake noise dynamometers are fundamental engineering tools for the systematic and efficient investigations of noise. However, the data obtained from a dynamometer must correlate with the noise achievable on a corresponding vehicle to be of true value in an investigation. The factors that can influence correlation between both vehicle and dynamometer tests are examined. In particular, correlation based on the following: - techniques for noise data acquisition, eval- uation and testing - variations of the brake system under load and time such as aging and wear effects - differences in the test proce- dure brake application parameters - variability of individual brake system components in terms of technical release and part-to-part variation. Problems and approaches for correlating dynamometer and vehi- cle brake test results are described. Test results for the correlation dynamometer - vehicle are also shown. 2001-01-3145.

This paper describes the use of a drag type (also included some brake stops simulations) noise dynamometer to validate brake squeal performance. The problems of correlating objective dyna- mometer measurement to subjective in-vehicle measurement are discussed. One of these, the perception of the human ear to sound is examined and the application of psychoacoustics to brake squeal is examined and applied using a practical example.

(P-364) A preliminary dynamic model of brake friction using pressure and temperature. Robert J. Karmi, Jr., The Boeing Co. 380</page><page sequence="380">2001-01-3150-2001-01-3165 Understanding the friction behavior of brake lining materials is fundamental to the ability to predict brake system performance. Of particular interest to the aviation community, where carbon/carbon composite heatsinks are commonly used, is the aircraft response at deceleration onset. There are two performance measures defining brake system performance at braking onset: deceleration onset rate and system response time. The latter is strictly a function of the brake system hydraulics and is not affected by brake lining friction. The former performance measure is a function of both system hydraulics and brake lining friction. Previously to the work herein, carbon heatsink friction was thought to be unpredictable at braking onset. That being the case, a predictive capability for deceleration onset rate was not previously undertaken. This meant that assess- ment of this performance measure waited until aircraft taxi tests were performed. This practice resulted in a system being completely designed, fabricated and partially qualified before its deceleration onset rate performance was assessed. Significant cost and schedule impacts have occurred trying to produce acceptable deceleration onset rates at that stage of the development cycle. A predictive capa- bility for deceleration onset performance is desirable. Full Scale Development (FSD) testing of the Harrier II aircraft during the early 1980's, revealed that the FSD brakes had an exces- sive deceleration onset rate. In pilot terms, they were deemed 'grabby.' The development of an acceptable brake for Harrier II included several configuration changes and took almost three years to define an acceptable production configuration. Whereas the raw material used to fabricate the heatsink in the production brake is no longer commercially available, a new carbon heatsink must be developed. The risk of reintroducing a 'grabby' brake problem and the finite inventory of the current heatsink justified a risk-reducing analysis effort. The analysis effort consisted of developing an analytical tool and validating it with both dynamometer and taxi tests. This effort showed that the unpredictability of the friction coefficient at decel- eration onset was due to theoretical errors in the manner in which friction is calculated. An improved method of calculating friction lead to a relationship between friction and pressure with an integra- tion constant that is thought to be a function of temperature. The new analytical tool, which includes the new friction model, satisfac- torily predicts the brake system deceleration onset rate performance. An acceptable prototype brake system configuration was produced during the initial taxi tests. Boeing is now under contract to qualify the new brake configuration and introduce it into the USMC Harrier II fleet. 2001-01-3152. (P-364) Harmonization activities on ISO and JIS Standards (compressibility) for brake linings in Japan. Masataka Kaido, Toyota Motor Corporation ; and Yosuke Sasaki , AKEBONO Research and Development Center , Ltd. A joint taskforce between the Sub-Committee (Brake Linings) of the J-SAE and the Technical Committee (Brake Linings) of the JAPIA from 1999 through 2001 has been conducting actual test runs of 'Compressibility of brake linings'based on ISO 6310 and JIS D 4413. The studies on 'Compressibility of brake linings'based on ISO and JIS test standards are discussed in this paper and some con- siderable improvements for these test procedures were obtained through these test studies and actual test runs. 2001-01-3157. (P-364) Validation testing of an environmen- tally friendly, corrosion-resistant coating for brake rotors. Terry E. Dorsett, M. J. Klimowski , and Mary McKerrell , Metal Coatings International Inc. The European End-of-Life Scrap Vehicle Directive approved in September of 2000 effectively bans the use of hexavalent chromium in automotive applications after July 1, 2003. In response to the directive, The United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) will disallow the use of hexavalent chromium in corro- sion-resistant coatings effective July 1, 2002. A new, chromium-free coating became commercially available in 1998 which provides a solution to this new directive. The coating is zinc and aluminum rich, silver in color, thin, water-based, volatile organic compound (VOC) compliant, and con- tains no toxic metals. It is heat resistant and offers excellent corro- sion protection without adversely affecting brake performance. This report summarizes validation testing for the automotive industry of brake rotors coated with the new, chromium-free coat- ing. Corrosion testing was conducted by an independent laboratory and included neutral salt spray, water fog and adhesion, and 350°C (662°F) heat to part metal temperature followed by SAE J2334 cyclic testing. Dynamometer testing was conducted by a separate independent laboratory. 2001-01-3158. (P-364) Study on reduction of brake squeal caused by in-plane vibration of rotor. Haruhisa Baba , Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd.; and Takahisa Wada and Takashi Takagi, Aisin Takaoka Co., Ltd. To reduce brake squeal is one of the most important issues in brake development.

(P-364) A system approach to the development of low runout corner modules that are robust to wheel clamp-up effects. David M. Home, TRW Chassis Systems. Controlling on-vehicle rotor runout is becoming increasingly important to minimize DTV (disc thickness variation) and its associ- ated brake roughness warranty complaints. To prevent roughness from occurring after high mileage, the on- vehicle rotor runout produced from the combined effects of assem- bling the wheel end components together on the vehicle generally should be 50 microns (0.050mm), or less. High runout still exists on some vehicles, even though individual component runouts have been significantly reduced over the last 10 years. In some cases, by simply mounting the wheel and tightening the wheel nuts, the runout of a low runout hub and rotor assembly can increase by more than 400 microns. To achieve low on-vehicle runout, it is therefore necessary to consider all elements that can affect runout together as a full 'sys- tem.' This paper describes the many factors that can contribute to run- out, and outlines a system approach that can be used to develop complete systems that achieve low on-vehicle runout. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3165. (P-367) Essential considerations in Delta-V determination. Richard Fay and John Scott, Fay Engineering Corp. While Delta-V has been one of the most used indicators of acci- dent severity for vehicle occupants, its actual determination remains a mystery to many who refer to it and use it. Delta-V is a term of art applied to a rapid change in vehicle velocity caused by impact forces during a collision. The Delta-V is associated with the high decelerations, which cause it and are applied to the occupants through restraint systems and collisions with the interior of the vehi- cle. This paper will serve as a primer for those new to the subject and a review for those who are familiar with the subject. Previous works by the authors will be referenced and other pertinent literature and data sources will be discussed. The analytical methods and test data used to calculate Delta-V will be presented and the relationship between Delta-V and other measures of impact severity, such as Barrier Equivalent Velocity and Energy Equivalent Speed will be discussed. The use of air bag sensor data will be included. The paper will discuss how various parameters and variables can affect the Delta-V, such as relative mass and stiffness of vehicles in vehicle- 381</page><page sequence="381">2001-01-3165-2001-01-3172 to-vehicle collisions, the collision geometry and the pre-impact motions of the vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3166. (P-367) Developing vehicle aggressivity rating system. Magdalena Less and Brian Fildes, Monash University. Vehicle crash compatibility is of major interest in road safety research as it focuses on both vehicle crashworthiness and aggres- sivity. Most of the research into vehicle safety to date has focused on vehicle crashworthiness promoting vehicle designs that overlook the protection of occupants in the 'other' vehicle in a vehicle-to- vehicle collision. Most recently this issue has lead to the develop- ment of new methods of vehicle aggressivity rating. This study presents two proposed vehicle aggressivity rating methods. The 'subject' car aggressivity is estimated based on injury outcome to the driver of the 'other' vehicle involved in a two- vehicle collision. The logistic regression technique is applied in order to adjust risk of driver injury for a number of endogenous and exogenous factors. The ability of the methods to 'rate' vehicle mod- els in terms of their aggressivity performance in two- vehicle crashes is briefly described. The issue of relative versus absolute risk of injury concepts, and confounding between crashworthiness and aggressivity is outlined. Desirable properties for a high quality aggressivity rating system are also proposed. 2001-01-3167. (P-367) Investigation of car stability in crash simulations. J. Bendisch, C. Thole, and H. von Trotha, GMD. In order to support the car design process, a software tool DIFF- CRASH has been conceived and recently been implemented by the GMD in the AUTOBENCH project, which is funded by the German Ministry of Research and Technology. This GMD contribution has been done in intense cooperation with project partners BMW and ESI. For a given parameter setting in a carmaker's Input Deck and on the basis of a resulting sample of DS Y-files (loosely speaking, a sample of cars), generated by ESI.PAM-CRASH software, so-called stability measures are calculated as statistics (over the car sample, e.g., average, standard deviation, etc.) for different underlying 'functionals.' The statistics are provided node- and state- wise, the functional use only geometric information from global node coor- dinates. In a DIFFCRASH run, for each chosen stability measure an ASCII-file of values, ordered according to states and secondly to nodes, is produced and then merged by means of the ESI. DSYMERGE-tool to a common DSY-file (on the basis of a selected DSY-file from the original sample). This so-called DSYMERGE- file is the main output of DIFFCRASH. The extended DSY-file may then be used for a color-encoded visualization with PAM- VIEW, in order to detect zones (hot spots) of high statistical values as a sug- gestive indication of instabilities. In this context, DIFFCRASH - results, from simulations with BMW Model 3, have confirmed the above proposed approach. Concrete results will be presented. 2001-01-3170. (P-370) Semi-solid casting of aluminum- Scandium (Zr) foundry alloys. A. Hoelzl and H. Kaufmann, ARC Leichtmetallkompetenzzentrum Ranshofen GmbH; and V. Konkevich , All Russia Institute of Light Alloys (VILS). The New Rheocasting (NRC) process was applied to cast test specimens of the alloy AlSi7Mg plus minor additions of Scandium and Zirconium. In this paper the process for manufacturing of com- plex-shaped components in semi-solid state is introduced. The semi- solid slurry is made from conventional melts by controlled cooling. There is no on-cost on the material. For comparison reasons the clas- sical AlSi7Mg (A356) alloy was cast in a step plate die, heat treated and tested. The same treatment was given to A356 + Sc alloys. Small variations of chemical composition were chosen for the inves- tigation of the formation of intermetallic phases and their behavior during heat treatment. Microstructural aspects and mechanical properties will be pres- ented. It can be shown that additions of Scandium have a positive influence on hardness and strength of manufactured samples. The alloys show good castability and a fine grain structure which could be caused by the refining effect of Scandium in combination with Strontium. The adaptation of the well-known alloy A356 with minor amounts of Scandium lead to new perspectives about using transi- tion metals in semi-solid manufactured products. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3171. (P-370) Process development and material characterization for the novel melt processing of near net shape foam parts. Dietmar Leitlmeier, ARC Leichtmetallkompetenz- zentrum Ranshofen GmbH; and Herbert Flanki, Hütte Kleinreichen- bach. In this paper, a new processing technique for producing closed cell net shape aluminum foam parts via the melt route developed by Hütte Klein-Reichenbach and ARC Leichtmetallkompetenzzentrum Ranshofen is presented. The new method facilitates the simplest method of producing a metallic foam by bubbling gas through a molten metal matrix com- posite (MMC). The resulting stable liquid aluminum foam is guided into a mold, where the foam is solidified. The bubble size of the pro- duced foam can be controlled by the new nozzle design of the gas bubbling equipment according to physical principles of bubble for- mation in molten metals. Homogeneous cellular structures are achieved for mass densities of 0,1 to 0,6 g/cm3 and narrow cell size distribution of 3 to 15 mm ± 2 mm. An important advantage of aluminum foam produced with this technique is the freedom it offers with the regard to variations of the process parameters and the alloy. In this way, it is possible to adjust the properties of the produced aluminum foam. A first characteriza- tion of manufactured foam samples with different densities is gained through compression tests. The cellular structure such as density distribution and cell wall thickness, are investigated by computed X-ray tomography and image analysis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3172.

Baekelandt, and B. Charot, CORUS Aluminum Rolled Prod- ucts ; and J. E. Waaijer, CORUS Automotive. A major objective of the European car manufacturers is to reduce the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of passenger cars by 25% by the year 2008. As the fuel consumption is strongly related to the weight of the car, realization of this objective will be achieved by long-term weight reduction programs. The European fuel tank market consists of around 14mMillion units in cars, of which approximately 70% contain HDPE (High- Density Poly Ethylene) fuel tanks, 17% leaded (Terne) steel, 3% aluminized steel and the remainder miscellaneous such as electro- coated Zn-Ni, galvannealed, hot-dipped tin or multi-layers with new substrates. The future legal regulations for fuel tanks will be dictated by the latest CARB (Californian Air Resources Board) specification LEV II (Low Emission Vehicle II). The main demand is the reduction of hydrocarbon (HC) emission for the total car from 2 down to 0.5 g/day in 2004. This demand appears doubtful for plastics, but is fea- sible for metal tanks. Next to the barrier technology and low permeability of the mate- rial, other demands are; good recyclability (80% of the vehicle must be recycled by the year 2005), low weight (reduction of CO2), noise, and no toxic metals (terne) by the year 2005. All these factors favor aluminum as the raw material for manu- facturing the fuel tanks of passenger cars. The fuel tank construc- tions are often very complex in shape because of the residual space left in the designed car, and therefore tend to be made of plastics due to their good formability.

Although hybrid vehicles and fuel cell technology are making rapid progress, fossil fuels will continue to be used as the primary source of power certainly for the beginning of this new century. This paper highlights some of the latest technologies and recent product requirements in fuel tanks with respect to the environmental demands, manufacturability and costs. 2001-01-3173. (P-370) A comparative design study for alumi- num and magnesium automatic transmission converter hous- ings. Peter D. Beggs and Daniel Byrnes , Cooperative Research Center for Cast Metals; and David Fitch , BTR Automotive Dri- vetrain Systems. The demand for vehicles with improved NVH characteristics, fuel economy and emissions control has increased dramatically in recent years. To meet these objectives stiffer and lighter housings are required so as to avoid troublesome driveline vibrations, while at the same time produce lighter structures to reduce the overall vehicle weight and improved fuel economy. A feasibility study was undertaken to examine the differences between the use of magnesium alloy and aluminum alloy for an automatic transmission converter housing. The design process, design constraints, design methodology, alloy selection and some unique magnesium design requirements are outlined. The differences between the two designs are investi- gated by simulating their static and dynamic performances using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A sand-cast prototype was produced for the first stage of the fea- sibility study, with the ultimate aim to produce die-cast magnesium converter housings if feasible. The outcomes and conclusions for this comparative study are presented, and demonstrate that magnesium alloy is a viable alterna- tive to aluminum alloy for this particular application at this stage of the study. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3174. (P-370) Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and quality monitoring of resistant spot welding based on quantita- tive ultrasonic technique. Roman Gr. Maev , DaimlerChrysler/ University of Windsor. The new materials structures, joints, parts, components made from various materials demand the innovative applications of mod- ern NDE techniques to monitor and control as many stages of the production process as possible. Simply put, intelligent advance manufacturing is impossible without integrating modern nonde- structive evaluation into the production system. For most of above reasons the role of NDE is changing and will continue to change dramatically. It has become increasingly evident that it is both practical and cost effective to expand the role of NDE and quality control to include all aspects of production process and to introduce it as much as earlier in the manufacturing cycle. Today, and even increasingly in the future, using advanced optical, thermal, ultrasonic, laser-ultrasound, acoustic emission sensors, vibrational, electro-magnetic, X-ray technique, etc., as well as modern measure- ment technique, along with signal/data processing, on-line in- formation on the processing conditions can be continuously gener- ated. Real-time process monitoring for more effective and efficient real-time control of various processes and as a result improved vehi- cle manufacturing quality control inspection and reliability will now become a practical reality. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3175. (P-370) Cumulative fatigue damage in an auto- mobile stabilizer bar: Correlation between laboratory and road experiments. Emani S. Palma, Catholic University of Minas Gerais - PUC. Minas; and Edvaldo S. dos Santos, Fiat Automíveis S.A. Fatigue damage correlation of a stabilizer bar in front suspension (McPherson) of a passenger car between laboratory and road experi- ments is presented. Cumulative fatigue damage theories together with experimental and analytical techniques of stress analysis are used to determine the fatigue damage imposed on the stabilizer bar, under both conditions (laboratory and actual conditions). FEM mod- els of the stabilizer bars were used to determine the local stresses at critical regions. These stresses were then measured in laboratory, by using strain gages bonded on the material. The assessments of fatigue damage of the stabilizer bar under actual conditions were performed with a component mounted on a vehicle, which was driven over different road surfaces and velocities. The results of both experiment types were correlationed and discussed. 2001-01-3176. (P-370) Lightweight and fatigue-resistant engi- neering design by simulation of biological optimization mecha- nisms. I. Tesari and C. Mattheck, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. The saving of weight is a very important demand for technical components which are used in car manufacture, because of the con- nection with energy consumption. Another requirement is a high fatigue resistance to extend the lifetime of the components. Based on the axiom of uniform stress, which is a basic design rule for bio- logical load carriers, and by use of the Finite Element Method (FEM) two computer programs have been developed at Forschungs- zentrum Karlsruhe to transfer these biological optimization mecha- nism to mechanical engineering. The Computer- Aided Optimization design procedure (CAO-method) simulates the principle of adaptive growth which biological structures, like trees, use to minimize stress concentrations on the surface. The Soft Kill Option (SKO-method) copies the adaptive bone mineralization and leads to lightweight structures. 2001-01-3177.

Zasim- chuk , G.V.Kurdymov Institute for Metal Physics; and M. V. Karuskevich, Kyiv National Aviation Univ. The moment the desire to decrease weight of constructions was a very hard challenge and interesting task for specialists in aero- space engineering. As a result, the problem of fatigue and other deformation damages became quite important and diagnostic meth- ods were very intensively developed. At the same time automotive professionals provoke and face the same problems during develop- ment of advanced vehicles with decreased mass. Abrupt exhaustion of exploitation resource of crucial elements of transportation sys- tems can lead to their unstable or uncontrollable behavior, and destruction. It is especially dangerous for the modern and future transportation systems under conditions of high- velocity and inten- sive traffic. Finally, it can lead to safety risk and catastrophic conse- quences even. That is why for monitoring of fatigue damage and exhaustion of exploitation resource in intelligent transportation systems we pro- pose to apply smart sensor technology that was developed by us for inspection of fatigue damage in aviation constructions during last 383</page><page sequence="383">2001-01-3178-2001-01-3184 years.

(P-369) Painting the 3Daycar: Developing a new approach to automotive coatings and lean manufacture. Mickey Howard and Andrew Graves , University of Bath. Automotive painting is essential not only for providing a flawless and emissions-free system of body coating, but as a key enabler of customer order fulfillment. Paint shops in the UK and Europe con- tinue to require large batch-sizes, long lead-times and suffer from high levels of defects. This represents considerable waste in the sys- tem, contrary to the principles of lean manufacture and building-to- order. This research suggests that the role of the paint shop may be changing, where the emphasis on production is moving towards cus- tomer-pull, total system reliability and batch sizes of one. Whilst the advance in water-borne and powder technology are likely to remain of an incremental nature, new manufacturing concepts such as alter- native body construction and thermoplastic in-molded color panel technology, may radically change how coatings are applied during vehicle production. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3180.

The Mexican automotive manufacturing industry is considered to be the leading and most competitive sector in this country's econ- omy, and it is well known for its use of modern manufacturing tech- nologies and philosophies. This paper address some selected aspects of the application of Just-In-Time initiatives in this industry, using the results of a research conducted in a selected group of automotive manufacturing plants from the central zone of Mexico, focusing mainly on the following elements: - Identification of the manufac- turing technologies and/or philosophies used in order to support the implementation process. - Identification of the methodologies used by these companies, in order to implement the Just in Time. - Identi- fication of the main obstacles during the implementation process, and how these industries overcome them. - Recommendations for the companies that are currently planning to initiate this implemen- tation process. The identification of these elements allowed us to analyze the current status of the implementation of Just In Time in the automo- tive manufacturing industries of Mexico, as well as to propose an initial methodology for the implementation process. Results and conclusions of this analysis are presented in the final part of the paper. 2001-01-3181. (P-368) Analysis of the combustion process in a heavy-duty transparent diesel engine equipped with 4-valve cylinder head and common-rail injection system. M Taschek, C. Fettes , and A. Leipertz, Friedrich- Alexander-Universität Erlangen- Niirnberg. Increasing decentralization of production combined with just-in- time delivery of products and components calls for a flexible and reliable transportation system. So far, trucks offer the most versatile and efficient solution to those problems. In consideration of increas- ingly strict emission standards and customer demands for more engine power and less fuel consumption, further selective develop- ments and optimization of Dl-diesel engines are necessary. One step in this direction is the application of 4 valves per cylinder in heavy- duty diesel engines to improve mixture formation of fuel and air to get a cleaner combustion and a higher power output. For visualizing the combustion processes inside the engine, an optically accessible heavy-duty Dl-diesel engine was used. This engine is a slightly modified conventional heavy-duty MAN engine based on the D0824 LFL 06 series. In contrast to a former version of the engine, the 2-valve cylinder head was replaced by an up-to- date 4-valve cylinder head. During the tests, the influence of the start of injection as well as an operating point with pre-injection were investigated. A major tar- get of the investigations was the evaluation of the combustion pro- cess by separation of flame and liquid fuel phase signals. The liquid phase was detected by the 2D Mie scattering technique. Simulta- neously, flame luminosity was detected two-dimensionally. The pictures taken inside the piston bowl clearly show the influ- ence of twist on the mixing of fuel and air. The spray exiting from the injection nozzle, which is placed in the center of the combustion bowl, is hardly affected by the twist whereas the fuel vapor is drifted away into the regions between two spray jets where it ignites and burns. For the operating point with pre-injection, the fuel of the main injection hits into the flame of the already burning pre- injection with possible negative effects on HC and soot emissions. At the end of the injection, after the closing of the needle, a flame is visible at the nozzle tip resulting from fuel evaporating from the sac-hole of the nozzle, which leads to increased HC emissions in the exhaust gas. 2001-01-3182.

Hirohisa Tanaka and Yasukazu Sato , Yokohama National University; and Takahiro U rai, Moo g Japan Ltd. This paper describes a performance of a newly designed pilot operated proportional injector for a 160 MPa common-rail diesel fuel injection system. The main needle valve is supported by a hydro-mechanical position feedback servomechanism for propor- tional injection-rate control, and the pilot valve is operated by a tan- dem-arrayed giant-magnetostrictive-actuator for quick motion con- trol instead of a piezo-electric actuator for shortening the length and adapting to solid-state drive. The injector discharges injection-rates up to 30 mm3/ms linearly to electric current within on/off lag times of 0.3 ms (on) and 0.5 ms (off) from a nozzle of 6 holes x 0.16 mm in diameter. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3183. (P-368) Modeling and simulation of common- rail systems. O. Chiavola and P. Giulianelli, University of ' Roma Tre' The performances of high-pressure fuel-injection systems and their effects on diesel engine combustion are strongly influenced by the injector characteristics and the set up of the whole equipment control system. High-pressure system based on the common-rail architecture allows a multi-stage injection, which is of paramount importance in controlling combustion noise, fuel consumption, operation roughness and exhaust pollutant emissions. Common-rail fuel injection equipment for automotive diesel engine, together with its control system have been analyzed by using Ames environment; both standard library elements and self- developed sub-models have been adopted. At first the different components have been considered one by one; in this way the behavior of high-pressure pump (radial-jet), pressure regulator, rail, injectors, system control (e. c. u.) has been investigated; the results have been compared with experimental measurements. Then all components have been collected and a sim- ulation tool has been set up, able to perform the parametric analysis of the geometry of some components. The performance of the com- plete system has been investigated and the response of the system to a typical driving cycle has been evaluated. 2001-01-3184. (P-368) Study of a common-rail fuel injection system. Kalevi Huhtala and Matti Vilenius, Tampere University of Technology. This research work deals with common-rail fuel injection system of a diesel engine. Fuel injection system tuning is important to pro- vide similar conditions to each injections. This means that the tim- 384</page><page sequence="384">2001-01-3184-2001-01-3191 in g of the fuel injection and control of the amount of the fuel during the injection have to be done accurately. The pressure oscillations might disturb the behavior of the fuel injection event if the system is not properly designed or tuned. In this work the pressure oscilla- tions and how to prevent them were studied. The study started with the modeling of the components of the Common-Rail fuel injection system. The simulation results were verified to measure dones. After the fluid properties were also taken into account the correspondence were acceptable. The simulation model were used for studying the performance a Common-Rail fuel injection system. This study deals also with the fluid properties in high pressure. Normally, interest is restricted to components as valves when researching fuel injection systems. The fluid itself is kept in a sec- ondary role. The increasing system pressure means that the fluid must be considered as a component with variable properties. In this study the bulk modulus, density and sonic speed has been defined as a function of pressure. The method used in this case is based on the determination of the time delay between two pressure sensors. The studied pressure range was 200ñl 450 bar. In the simulation results the injected volume and injection pres- sure are shown as a function of injection time. Following fluid prop- erties were also presented as a function of pressure; bulk modulus, density and sonic speed. In addition two different types of Common Rails and two lengths of rails were considered. The main point for these measurements was to use the calculated bulk modulus, density and sonic speed val- ues and examine the suitability of these to determined fuel proper- ties in different fuel injection system. Also the behavior differences of these two different rail types were studied. 2001-01-3185.

An analysis of the relationship between the injection rate and the rate of heat release through the physical variables that directly participate in the injection-combustion process is per- formed. To approach the problem, a parameter called 4 Apparent Combus- tion Time (ACT)'is defined. A theoretical analysis that allows the identification and quantification of the main physical variables that directly affect the air/fuel mixing process has been performed. This theoretical approach enabled to find out the relationship between the ACT and the injection and in-cylinder conditions in the diffusion combustion phase. This theoretical analysis has been compared with the results obtained from an experimental parametric study. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3186. (P-372) Development of HILS system for ABS ECU of commercial vehicles. Doh-Young Park, Don-Ha Hwang, Ki-Chang Lee, Jeong-woo Jeon, and Yong-Joo Kim, Korea Electro- technology Research Institute ( KERI ); and Jeong-Mok Cho, and Joong-Seon Joh, Changwon National Univ. Antilock Brake System (ABS) is designed to prevent wheels from locking. Therefore ABS, regardless of road conditions, improves directional stability, shortens stopping distance, and enhances maneuvering during braking. Hardware In-the-Loop Sim- ulation (HILS) is and effective tool for design, performance evalua- tion and test of vehicle subsystems such as ABS, active suspension, and steering systems. A fourteen-degrees-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model is simulated in alpha-chip processor board. The proposed HILS system is tested by a basic ABS control algorithm. This paper describes a HILS model for an ABS/ASR application. Also the design and implementation of HILS system for develop- ment of the ABS ECU (Electronic Control Unit) for commercial vehicles are presented. The HILS system simulation results show that the proposed HILS system may be used to realistically test per- formance, stability, and reliability of vehicle. 2001-01-3187. (P-372) Robust adaptive stabilization of mov- ing a car under braking with ABS in control circuit. M. Magome- dov and V. Alexandrov, Lomonosov State University of Moscow; and K.

Considered a problem of building optimum robust-adaptive reg- ulator for ensuring of longitudinal and transverse stability of car, condition which known only in discrete moments of time. Analyzed situation, when is realized car emergency braking on surfaces with different friction factors for left and right wheels, as well as on roads, where occurs a constant changing a covering with low and high friction factor. From standpoints of trends to the snow- drift (loss of stability) area of initial braking is the most dangerous. It is offer to use two different circuits of control for separate deciding the problems to maximization a deceleration and minimi- zation of angular speedup of prowling. For the building of robust regulator is used method, based on using the Ly apuno v square-law functions. It is build single-line model of moving a vehicle, described by differential 16-order equations. 2001-01-3188. (P-372) Caravan active braking system - Effective stabilization of snaking of combination vehicles. M. A. Alonso Fernández and R. S. Sharp, Cranfield Univ. The paper is a theoretical study of the design, effectiveness and implementation of a differential braking system for caravans and other trailers - Caravan Active Braking System (CABS). The system addresses the common problem of snaking at moderate to high road speeds. The idea developed is to utilize measurements of the relative yaw angle between car and caravan to motivate individual trailer brake actuation - one brake at a time - with magnitude and phasing chosen to damp the snaking motions. Linear and non-linear system models are developed, allowing control design by root locus tech- niques and evaluation by simulation. Stabilization of the snaking is demonstrated. Robustness against usage variations is checked. Component needs are similar to those for contemporary traction control and stability enhancement systems. 2001-01-3189. (P-372) The kinetic brake booster. Valentin Ivanov, Belarusian State Polytechnic Academy; and Joseph Lepeshko and Vladimir Boutylin, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. Main defect of traditional structure of the brake boosters is the necessity of an external energy source. The analysis of redistribution of power streams occurring during at braking of the automobile shows that it is possible to use the force component of the driving automobile kinetic energy for the drive of a booster (so-called kinetic booster). The power consumed by a booster is taken from power developed during brake action thereby it promotes vehicle slowing down. In the paper for the booster work the schémas of power take-off from an engine, onboard electric system, transmission, single wheel are considered. Especially for brake-by-wire systems the project of pilot management is probed. It allows applying the serial x-by-wire components both on small automobiles and on vehicle with the great load-carrying capacity and trailers. 2001-01-3191. (P-372) Dynamometer simulation study for market brake judder. Yasushi Suganuma, Frank Howse, and Cal- vin Thornton, Honda R&amp;D Americas, Inc. Among brake vibration and noise problems, brake judder is a problem that automobile manufacturers and brake suppliers have researched for a long time. As luxury feeling and comfort are 385</page><page sequence="385">2001-01-3191-2001-01-3199 required expectations of newer passenger cars, improvement of jud- der performance continues to be an important concern. Judder is generally categorized into three different types. The first is the DTV (Disk Thickness Variation) type in which aggres- siveness of brake friction material generates DTV. The second is the corrosion-type brake judder in which torque fluctuates due to corro- sion-induced (ix variation and surface damage. The third is the hot judder type in which torque fluctuates due to disk rotor distortion caused by high temperature. To accurately analyze causes for brake judder observed in the market, we have conducted detailed analyses on brake parts from the market. The results have helped us understand that DTV and cor- rosion have reciprocal effects, mutually impacting one another. Based on the analysis results of market parts, we will present some examples, applying our findings to brake judder simulations on the dynamometer. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3192. (P-368) Future power plants for cars. Peter Walzer , FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. Environmental concern demands that emissions and fuel con- sumption of vehicles have to improve considerably in the next 10 years. New technologies for gasoline engines, downsizing with high boosting, direct injection and fully variable valve train systems, are being developed. For diesel engines, improved components includ- ing piezo-based injectors and particle filters are expected. In the dri- vetrain new starter-generator systems as well as automated manual transmissions are being developed. In parallel alternative fuels are investigated and the use of hybrid drives and fuel cells are devel- oped. This paper reports the progress made in the recent years and gives a comparative assessment on the different technologies with a prediction of the introduction dates and volumes into the market. 2001-01-3194.

Disadvantages of piston engine are pointed out and advan- tages of rotary engines are stressed. The simple calculations are added in order to convince the opponents. The very early develop- ment procedures of the two rotary engines design are described. The important parts of first rotary engine are machined out and the diffi- culties that occur already during the assembly phase are pointed out. On the basis of the analysis of the troubles that we have with this first rotary engine the second rotary engine is proposed.

Stefan Postrzednik and Zbigniew Zmudka, Silesian Uni- versity of Technology. In the paper a new concept of the reference cycle (called as eco- cycle) of IC engine is presented. Diminishing of emission (gaseous phase and solid particles) from combustion engines can be achieved by realization of two groups of undertakings: primary (inside- engine) doings, secondary doings, comprising catalysts and solid particle filters. The work of the engine basing on the eco-cycle occurs in two 3-stroke stages. In range of each stage a new portion of fuel is burned. The fuel combustion for the whole cycle can be performed at relatively low values of air excess &gt; 1. The pro- posed solution bases on the possibilities of the diminishing of the emission, which the primary doings contain. The elaborated eco- cycle leads to the diminishing of the toxic substance emission and to the improving of engine efficiency. 2001-01-3196.

The information system has been developed and implemented for the purpose of directing of the motor vehicle maintenance system. The common and individual data bases have been developed for these processes (regarding workers, locations, failures, vehicles, maintenance operations, spare parts), as well as the reports on main- tenance, for the purpose of providing valid information required for directing of the maintenance system. Due to the extensive scope of the software solutions, this paper depicts only the basic common solution and the individual bus- maintenance software solution for the 'Fix-Iť processes. For this individual 'Fix-Iť process, the mode of operation and the results of its application in on-the-road maintenance are shown in this paper. 2001-01-3197. (P-371) Vehicle diagnostics - Are you ready for the challenge? Joseph B arkai, Diagnostic Strategies. Fast pace advancements in vehicle technologies, and, in particu- lar, in embedded electronics, coupled with continued pressure to reduce costs and improve time to market continue to challenge the automotive service community. In addition to having to keep up with developments in vehicle technology, strict regulation places increased burden in accuracy of diagnosis and repair, and con- versely, open standards emerging from the infotainment industry introduce new challenges stemming from diversity, complexity and lack of regulation. Still, current diagnostic engineering and delivery methods are grossly inefficient and are too slow to respond to these challenges. Ill-equipped service technicians must face these chal- lenges using inefficient methods and outdated information, resulting in increased repair costs and warranty claims, and decline in cus- tomer satisfaction. This paper presents an enterprise approach to managing diagnos- tic knowledge. Instead of a late lifecycle-phase activity, this diag- nostic knowledge management strategy makes diagnostic develop- ment an integral part of the vehicle development and manufacturing lifecycle. The strategy is centered on efficient methods to create, discover, repurpose and disseminate diagnostic knowledge through- out the organization and the dealer network. 2001-01-3198. (P-371) Exhaust pressure signal for automo- tive engines diagnosis. O. Chiavola and S. Conforto , University of ' Roma Tre'. During the internal combustion engine operation some faults in the combustion process can occur, affecting the overall engine per- formance. Nowadays, aimed at detecting such faults, different tech- niques are adopted, which are mainly based on the identification of key parameters characterizing both regular and fault engine running. The engine vibration and the engine instantaneous angular velocity are generally used as monitoring signal. In this paper an experimen- tal methodology based on the processing of the exhaust pressure sig- nal is considered. The results obtained in a test cell on a SI four- cylinder engine are presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3199. (P-373) An active regeneration aid as a key ele- ment for safe particulate trap use. Paul Zelenka, Stefan Schmidt, and Gerhard Elfinger, Zeuna Staerker GmbH &amp; Co. KG. The paper reports on the development of cost-effective active regeneration aids as a 'worst case soluti on 'for implementation in diesel particulate traps, particularly with respect to long time vehicle operation in the inner-city at very low exhaust gas temperature level. Two different principles of active measures were investigated: heating the entire exhaust gas by fuel burner to initiate the soot burn- ing or applying so-called 'hot spot' heating by electrical heaters to start the regeneration of the loaded trap. Both methods may be com- bined with engine management measures to lower the necessary energy input. Based on this investigation, several systems have been developed and tested on modern diesel engines for passenger cars at steady state and dynamic operation at difficult conditions such as low speed and very low load close to idle. Advantages and disadvantages of the systems are reported. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 386</page><page sequence="386">2001-01-3200-2001-01-3210 2001-01-3200. (P-373) Non-thermal plasma-enhanced urea- SCR treatment of diesel exhaust for low-temperature NOx reduction. Thomas Hammer , Siemens AG. Test bench measurements were performed demonstrating low- temperature non-thermal plasma-enhanced selective catalytic reduc- tion of NOx in the exhaust of a 1.9-liter direct injection diesel engine. The plasma-catalytic hybrid system consisted of an oxida- tion catalyst, a modular dielectric barrier discharge reactor for plasma treatment, a semiconductor switched pulse voltage source for electrical excitation, and an urea SCR system based on a mono- lithic V205-W03/TÍ02 catalyst. In a test cycle simulating urban driving conditions the average NOx-mass flow was reduced from 27 g/h down to 11.5 g/h. Maximum NOx-reduction rates of 28 g/h were obtained at an energy cost of 10 Wh/g NOx. The ammonia storage capability of the catalyst was utilized for reduction at tem- peratures below 140°C. 2001-01-3201. (P-373) Large-scale particulate filter demon- stration project in Odense.

(P-373) Aftertreatment for reduction of diesel exhaust particulate. Xu Xiaoguang, Gao Xiyan , and Wang Xianc- heng, Dalian University of Technology (DUT); and Li Chengbin, Institute of Information Engineering , DUT. Three types of aftertreatment for reduction of diesel exhaust par- ticulate are investigated mainly about their characteristics of filtra- tion and regeneration. They are ceramic foam filter (CFF) and microwave regeneration (MR), stainless steel net trap with electro- static collector (SSNTEC) and reverse jet regeneration (RJR) with high-pressure gas, wall flow ceramic filter (WFCF) and infrared heating regeneration (IHR). With the data from experiments, the fil- tration efficiency of CFF is up to 60% and the efficiency of MWR reach 80% upward. The average efficiency of SSNTEC is about 60% and the efficiency of RJR is just 55%. WFCF and IHR have outstanding performance, the efficiency of WFCF reach 90% upward and its IHR is complete. 2001-01-3205. (P-369) An integrated approach to the design of enterprise information systems. Li Kuang , SE Technologies Ltd.; and James Gao, School of Industrial and Manufacturing Sci- ence. The implementation of information systems is a lengthy and expensive process. It is estimated that in average between half and two-thirds of the total cost for ERP systems is spent on the imple- mentation stage. However, there is no established implementation model for such systems for manufacturing companies. Software vendors only provide 'best practice' software package for compa- nies. However, different companies have different manufacturing strategies due to their market positions. These strategies ultimately result in new functional requirements, design parameters and vari- ables for implementation of an enterprise information system. Both researchers and practitioners have recognized that a methodology is needed to assist manufacturing companies to achieve integration goals during information system implementation. This project pres- ents the result of a company-based research project aiming at the above problem. In principle, information system implementation can be viewed as the process of evolving a design and configuration. This process consists of the decomposing of functional requirements and mapping between the functional requirements derived from the manufacturing strategy and software components. The implementa- tion methodology provides a framework for the implementation of enterprise information system to meet the requirements of the com- pany's manufacturing strategy. An integration implementation approach should be adapted to assist manufacturing companies to achieve integration goals during the system implementation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3206.

By an increasing distinction of the processes in the product development and the heterogeneous teams arising from it, the cre- ation for an efficient coordination and cooperation infrastructure gets still more important. This efficient structures are created by the implementation of suitable communication tools. However, forms must be found as job sequences can be defined and actions aroused in this multi-user environment. For this speech acts, which are a nat- ural form of the human interaction serve.

The principal system is the UTC which controls some 2000 traffic signals in London. There are three Com- paq Alpha-based mini-computers which are connected to the Data Transmission Equipment (DTX) using Front End Processor (FEP) systems.

(P-367) Body section rollover test as an approval method for required strength of bus superstructures. Máty ás Matolcsy, Scientific Society of Mechanical Engineers. UN-ECE Regulation 66 describes the requirements of bus frames in case of rollover accident. The required strength of the superstruc- ture shall be proved by the standard rollover accident, which is an approval test method, too. The regulation allows for the manufactur- ers to choose other approval tests, e.g. the rollover test of body sec- tions. This approval test is assumed to be equivalent to the rollover test. The Reg. 66. does not say too much about the problems and details of this test. This paper collects and discusses these problems and tries to find solutions. This is a very up-to-date subject, while the modification of Reg. 66. - made by an international expert group in Geneva - is going on, and it is very useful to formulate and discuss the main problems on international forums. The main topics belong- ing to this subject are the following: how to choose and build the body sections for testing, which parameters (geometry, mass, iner- tia, energy absorbing capacity) of the tested body section shall be related to the vehicle, how to perform the rollover test and how to evaluate the test results? 2001-01-3210.

(P-367) Development of the MADYMO CRABI-6 dummy head model for side impact simulation. Michal Wozniak and Shankar Kalyanasundaram, The Australian National University ; and Craig Newland and Mark Terrell , The Department of Transport and Regional Services. This paper describes the development of a validated MADYMO CRABI-6 dummy model for the purpose of simulating lateral impact to the CRABI-6 dummy. An investigation of the current CRABI-6 model revealed that the contact interaction properties of its head are significantly flawed. Without further development, such a model produces incorrect injury values and flawed dummy dynamics. Laboratory tests to characterize the lateral dummy head response were designed and conducted. Using mathematical methods, a MADYMO model was developed to simulate the laboratory tests and validated against laboratory results. Both injury prediction and time-history responses were used as a basis for comparison. Good correlation between the computer model and laboratory tests was obtained, resulting in a model capable of predicting side impact injury responses for the CRABI-6 dummy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3212. (P-367) Three-dimensional dynamic model for a quick simulation of vehicle collisions. Marco Evangelos Bian- colini, Carol Brutti , Dario Del Pin , and Luigi Receia , uTor Vergata ' University. The aim of this work is to develop a simulation tool able to fore- see the dynamic behavior of a vehicle involved in an emergency maneuver. This tool is suitable to reproduce the real dynamic of an accident and so could be exploited both for road safety analyses and both for accident reconstruction. In order to perform the dynamic analysis we have developed a detailed three-dimensional handling model able to estimate interac- tions between tires and road; furthermore, an interaction model is required to simulate the interaction between vehicles and/or between vehicle and ground, taking into account high-speed plastic strain. The latter interaction was evaluated according a three-dimensional simplified model, called 'collision points model, 'based on the assumption that bounding surface of the car, meshed with a polyhe- dron, is connected to the rigid body representing the car, by means of a damper and a spring in series. After contact detection, interac- tion loads are computed imposing equilibrium and compatibility conditions. Overall interaction loads together with external forces due to weight are used to integrate equations of motion for each rigid body on a explicit time step basis. Correctness of handling model was checked simulating a standard test and obtaining a very good agree- ment between numerical and experimental results. Interaction capa- bility were widely tested starting with simple applications consisting in a bouncing sphere and a spinning top. Capability to reproduce accident dynamic was also tested on the basis of measured data. 2001-01-3213. (P-367) Improving rollover crashworthiness through inverted drop testing. Brian Herbst , Stephen Forrest, Ste- ven E. Meyer, and Davis Hock, Safety Analysis and Forensic Engi- neering. Inverted drop testing of vehicles is a methodology that has long been used by the automotive industry and researchers to test roof integrity. In our laboratory, the inverted drop test methodology was employed on late model production vehicles to simulate the damage incurred by a real-world rollover accident. The extent and shape of residual damage matched well with the corresponding accident dam- age. Modified vehicles were reinforced based upon previously docu- mented techniques. Incorporation of these techniques demonstrated a significant increase in roof strength and corresponding reduction in roof crush with minor weight addition. Finally, a production vehi- cle and structurally enhanced vehicle were drop tested with instru- mented Hybrid-Ill occupants. This pair of tests confirms that reduc- tion of roof intrusion and increased headroom can significantly enhance occupant protection. It also highlights the need to maintain adequate survival space for the vehicle's occupants. 2001-01-3215. (P-370) The behavior of the 2090 alloy at plas- tic deformation through dynamics cold upsetting. Marius Vasilescu and Ioana Vasilescu, University uPolitehnica ' of Bucha- rest. The experimental researches made to settle the behavior at defor- mation of Al-Li alloys of 2090 type was realized on anneal samples through dynamics cold upsetting. The aim of this paper is to have in view the variation of degree of deformation with structure and properties of materials in different state of metallurgical processing. It was settled the maximum possi- ble degree of cold deformation of Al-Li alloys of 2090 type until cracks don't appear. The behavior of the 2090 alloy at plastic deformation through dynamics cold upsetting was studied through: - the variation of spe- cific mechanical work k [daN/mm2] with the degree of deformation £[%]; - the variation of deformation resistance p [daN/mm2} with the degree of deformation £[%]; - the variation of hardness [HRB] with the degree of deformation £[%]. By examination of the dependence between specific mechanical work and the degree of deformation, deformation resistance work and the degree of deformation, respectively hardness and the degree of deformation, it was settled the equations which describe the behavior of the tested alloy to cold plastic deformation through dynamics upsetting. 2001-01-3216. (P-370) Influence of the volume fraction solid on the properties of semi-solid cast A356 parts. A. Mundi and H. Kaufmann, ARC Leichtmetallkompetenzzentrum Ranshofen GmbH; and J. Wassermann, Technische Universität Wien. The New Rheocasting Process (NRC) is a novel semi-solid cast- ing technology starting from a fully liquid melt with low superheat, which is poured into steel cups and thereby quenched into the semi- solid regime, and then cooled to forming temperature by controlled cooling. Due to the containment of the semi-solid melt in the steel cup it is not necessary to prepare stable alloy slugs for further han- dling operations and therefore, possible to adjust the fraction solid to the requirements of the casting. Thin-walled castings may require lower fraction solid then thicker- walled castings. This paper investigates the influence of variations in volume fraction solid on the resulting mechanical properties of the NRC parts. Different fractions solid are equal to different slug tempera- tures during forming and may result in different surface tempera- tures in the die. This influence was investigated as well. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3217.

The new method, which can quickly and accurately estimate the stiffness of the jointed part of the automobile body structure by using neural network, is proposed. The non-linear relation between the rotation vectors of the end section of the jointed part and the stiffness of the jointed part is constructed by using neural network. Once the relation of both is constructed, the values of joint stiffness can be estimated by only inputting the some elements of rotation vectors into the trained neural network. And the ability of this method was verified by using some examples. 2001-01-3220.

(P-368) Simulation of endurance and thermo cycle testing for highly loaded HSDI diesel cylinder heads. Franz J. Maassen, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH. Due to today's demands to reduce cost and product time to mar- ket, engineering procedures are increasingly using more sophisti- cated simulation techniques, instead of validation testing. Early implementation of CAE methods yield higher quality products, even with first prototypes, reducing the design iterations required to reach production quality. The strategy is to conduct specific evaluations of a realistic representation of the product while focusing on the key boundary conditions necessary to extract fatigue effects. Discussed in this paper are adequate CAE methods for early identification, evaluation and removal of conceptual and local structural weak- nesses. Possible solutions gained from a computational optimization process are discussed for highly loaded HSDI diesel cylinder heads as a representative example. Preloading conditions representing the manufacturing process (residual stresses due to the mold process respectively heat treat- ment and machining) and assembly loads (press fits, bolting) are superimposed with operation loads (temperature distribution, gas loads) in all non-linear FEA, applying the latest commercial ABAQUS® FE-solver. Subsequently performed simulations like thermo-shock and durability testing underline the high influence of the load history and single load collectives on operational safety and life-span. 2001-01-3227.

The objective of this work is to make an analysis of the behavior of the venturi in real working conditions. The modeling of the ven- turi, as well as the experimental and modeled results obtained, will be described. Modeled and measured techniques have been used to realize this work. A new model of the venturi was developed and using this, it is possible to find important instantaneous variables of the venturi. In order to adjust the calculated model, it was necessary to charac- terize the steady flow test rig of the venturi. In addition, the informa- tion obtained from the engine tests has been essential to correctly adjust the model. Therefore, a combination of the information obtained from both the venturi test and from modeled work was nec- essary in order to understand the behavior of the venturi installed in an engine. Different tests have been performed on each venturi. This singu- lar device has been tested while installed in an engine that has a real pulsating flow, while other tests of the venturi have been performed in a test flow rig. Relevant variables which have been measured, are the pressures at the inlet, at the throat of the venturi and at one point downstream of it. Additionally, a theoretical calculation has been carried out, focusing on the gas evolution through the venturi. Thus, the pressure loss parameters for different parts of the venturi, such as the converging part or the EGR junction in the venturi, have been obtained. Normally, the flow is pulsating in the engine manifolds and so the response of the venturi is of special interest when it is used to produce an EGR pulsating mass flow. This response influences the EGR production and, of course, the characteristics of the venturi, such as the pressures loss parameters, which are very important for correctly modeling the venturi. 389</page><page sequence="389">2001-01-3228-2001-01-3234 2001-01-3228. (P-368) Modeling of wall films formed by impinging diesel sprays. Kibae Hong , Chungju University ; Seong Hyuk Lee , Seoul National University; and Hong Sun Ryou , Chung- Ang University. The aim of this article is in modeling and application of wall films resulting from the impinging diesel sprays. The mass and momentum equations of the film are derived in an integral form for film thickness on the basis of the incompressible boundary layer approximations. The major physical processes affecting the liquid film include mass and momentum contributions to the film due to spray impingement, splashing effect, shear forces on the film and dynamic pressure effects. After integrating in the cross-film direc- tion, the three-dimensional film equations can be reduced to 2D flow equations and solved by the predictor-corrector step using the Euler method as a predictor. With the present film model, the new model published earlier (Lee and Ryou, 2000a) is used for spray/ wall interactions. Assessment of the spray/wall interaction model and the film model is performed for the non-evaporative diesel sprays by comparing their predictions against several sources of experimental data. The computational model for spray/wall interac- tions is in fairly good agreement with experimental data for both spray radius and height. The film model suggested in the present work is better than the static film model presented previously, indi- cating that the dynamic effects of film motion should be considered for wall films. It may be thought that the present film model is acceptable for prediction of the film radius and thickness. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3229. (P-368) Simulation of liquid phase penetration in diesel spray. R. Rotondi, University of Rome ' La Sapienza ' In order to investigate on the complex phenomena that occur in the evolution of an evaporating fuel spray (like break up, fuel multi- component evaporation, liquid gas interaction) a numerical analysis has been carried out. The numerical tool used is a modified version of the well-known KIVA code in which a new break up model, developed and validated in previous work, and a fuel multicompo- nent evaporation model have been included. The predictive capabil- ity of the evaporation model has been evaluated by comparison with single droplet experimental data. Then the code has been used to evaluate the influence of fuel and injection system parameters (noz- zle diameter and injection pressure) on spray penetration and morphology. 2001-01-3230. (P-368) Three-dimensional calculation of the flow in a DI diesel engine with variable swirl intake ports. Jesús Benajes, Xandra Margot, José V Pastor, and Antonio Gil, Universi- dad Politécnica de Valencia. The objective of this paper is to analyze the flow characteristics inside the cylinder of a DI diesel engine at variable swirl number. Initially, the cylinder head is characterized by means of three- dimensional calculations of the steady flow through the intake ports. These calculations have been made for several positions of the throt- tles, from wide open, to closed, using the STAR-CD commercial CFD code. They have been validated with steady flow experimental data measured with torque-meter. Next, 3D calculations of the com- pression stroke are presented and compared with experimental mea- surements. The initial conditions inside the cylinder in the TDC have been estimated using the head characterization tests and a zero- dimensional model. The results obtained are in good agreement with the experiments. 2001-01-3231. (P-368) Modeling and control of transient engine conditions. George J. Vachtsevanos and Theocaris K. Boukas, Georgia Institute of Technology. In gasoline direct injection engines, fuel is injected into the port walls and the valve. During the engine startup cycle, the temperature of these parts is not adequate to evaporate all the fuel that impacts the walls. As a result, a fraction of the injected fuel does not contrib- ute to the combustion cycle. This fraction forms fuel puddles (wall- wetting) and a portion of it passes to the crankcase. The efficiency of the engine during the startup cycle is decreased and hydrocarbon emissions increased. It is obvious that a control strategy is necessary to minimize the effects of this transient performance of the engine. This paper investigates a modeling framework for the valve, and simulation results validate model performance when compared to available experimental data. The simulation studies lead to a con- ceptual control design, which is briefly outlined. 2001-01-3232.

Shin Matsuoka, Sci- ence University of Tokyo. This paper describes the causality discussion such as the con- flicted relationship in SRFNPH (simultaneous reduction of SFC, NOx, Particulate, HC) performance characteristics in HONDA-Pre- Chamber SI-CVCC, MITSUBISHI-DISC-SI-GDI, NISSAN DISC- CI-MK and CLEAN ENGINE-DISC-CI-OSKA-DH. The processes to be SRFNPH in these four combustions are shown as follows. M-GDI prepares LGF (low grade fumigation state in 15-10% and 400-600K temperature) state at ignition timing as same as N-MK Zone did. OSKA has no more this. In GDI, MK and OSKA, HGF (high grade fumigation state in 15-10% and about 1000K tempera- ture) state that is prepared by (STIM stratified ignition mechanism) and REABP (re-entrainment of active burned products) around the ignition timing was the state to form radical species and kinetic reac- tion. These are very similar conditions created by CVCC-REABP which was made by high-speed burned gas jet from pre-chamber. In OSKA formed rolling mushroom-type spray cloud by collisions plays a role to create SRFNP characteristics without EGR, without ignition delay because of its strong REABP function. The indispens- able functions in CVCC, GDI, Mk and OSKA to create SRFNPH are STIM through the stratified rotating flow with strong turbulence to form feedback function of REABP and this formed radicals and attained SRFNPH. 2001-01-3233. (P-368) Multidimensional modeling of the sca- venging and injection processes of a small two-stroke engine compared to LDV measurements. J. Galindo, Universidad Poli- técnica de Valencia; J. V. Pastor, J. R. Serrano, and J. M. Pastor, Georgia Institute of Technology; and C. Gaia, Nacional Motor S.A. The scavenging and injection processes on a 50 cc crankcase- scavenged compressed air-assisted direct fuel injection 2-stroke engine are analyzed by means of multidimensional CFD modeling. A moving mesh including the intake ports, cylinder and exhaust port has been built, solving the interface at ports. The information at boundaries is obtained from a one-dimensional wave action model. A detailed analysis of the scavenging process is presented. A motored engine with suitable optical access has been used to measure in-cylinder velocities by Laser Doppler Velocimetry LDV. Due to the small engine size some technical problems had to be solved to carry out the measurements. The comparison between the modeled and measured velocities shows good agreement. Finally, the validated multidimensional modeling has been used for the optimization of the injection process in terms of fuel short- circuit to the exhaust and also of mixture quality. A study of the fuel injection timing and location shows the key points to optimize injec- tion and mixing process. 2001-01-3234.

(P-368) Modeling of a four-valve S.I. engine combustion: A comparison of two 3-D computer codes. G. Fon- tana , E. Galloni , and R. Palmac cio, University of Cassino. In previous papers, the authors proposed a hybrid combustion model able to predict the behavior of a small spark-ignition, multi- valve, multipoint injection engine, at different operating points. The combustion model proposed was implemented in the KIVA-3V code for a closed valve simulation of engine operation. The results obtained for pressure cycles showed good agreement to the measured data and the characteristic constant of the model resulted less sensitive to the engine operating conditions such as rotational speed. Since the present research activity is aimed to investigate the potential for the adoption of alternate fuels, the latter point was considered of interest in modeling such off-design opera- tion as a change in engine fueling. In this paper, the simulation results obtained by using the KIVA-3V code are compared to those provided by a different multidimensional code: AVL FIRE 72b. The same computing mesh, reproducing the combustion chamber of the engine under study, has been utilized in both multidimensional codes and their different modeling capabilities have been analyzed. In particular, the two codes utilize different combustion models (Eddy-Breakup, PDF, CFM) and different turbulence models (k-e, RSM). Thus, in order to evaluate the AVL FIRE code capability in providing sound engine information for engineering applications, the simulation results are compared. Furthermore, the results pro- vided by the two codes, mainly in terms of indicated mean effective pressure, are compared to the experimental data obtained at the Cas- sino University Laboratory. 2001-01-3236. (P-371) A software tool for real-time modeling and simulation of car audio systems. S. Bartolom , F. Bettarelli, A. Lattanzi, and F. Piazza , University of Ancona; and R. Toppi , M. Navarri , and M. Pontillo, FAITAL Spa. This paper presents a new software tool that is able to model, store, reproduce and compare car audio systems. The software uses a discrete-time, linear, time-invariant MIMO model, implemented by a matrix of FIR filters. To identify the model parameters a MLS- based estimation method is employed while the effects of the acqui- sition and reconstruction devices (microphones, headphone, etc.) are reduced using an inverse filter adaptively designed. The simulator is able in real time to compare different audio systems, to change seat and select a head pan and tilt within a number of fixed positions. To make the listening experience more effective, a novel visual feedback has been added to the audio simulator, i.e., it is possible to be 'virtually seated' in the car seeing the interior from the proper point of view. 2001-01-3237. (P-371) Achieving a cost-efficient and depend- ability scalable system for automotive applications, using the QRcontrol communication protocol. Hakan Sivencrona and Lars- Âke Johansson , Chalmers University of Technology. This paper presents methods to easily increase the dependability and fault tolerance of a scalable bit-oriented cyclic protocol, QRcon- trol, utilizing TDMA technique. Minor changes to the protocol soft- ware and built-in techniques in the controller can give increased dependability for changing requirements on the system. These tech- niques include, for example, enabling of double buses, checksums for a node or a whole TDMA cycle, bus guardians and different fault detection mechanisms for some or all nodes in the cluster. The concept can be assigned to a very broad range of applica- tions, from body electronics in cars to 'By- Wire' applications with the highest dependability requirements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3238. (P-373) Application of V2O5 catalysts to diesel NOx emission control. A. Sawata, Y. Murakami , Y. Tsuru , M. Tanoura, and H. Endo, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. DeNOx catalysts consisting of V205-Cr2C&gt;3-TiC)2 and V2O5-M0O3-TÍO2 have been prepared by means of the coprecipita- tion method, characterized in terms of crystal structure using XRD and surface composition using XPS analysis. NOx reduction perfor- mance of urea on these catalysts has also been investigated using actual diesel engine exhaust gas. Consequently, it was found that these catalysts show high DeNOx activity and high reaction velocity above 300°C. With respect to the thermodynamic equilibrium for gaseous urea decomposition, it was considered that the DeNOx reaction might progress according to NH3-SCR at temperatures above 300°C, but that the reaction would be controlled at tempera- tures below 300°C by decomposition of urea adsorbed on the cata- lyst, or by hydrolysis on the catalyst of adsorbed isocyanic acid derived from urea decomposition. 2001-01-3239. (P-373) Microprocessor controlled three-way catalyst efficiency monitoring system (a progress report). Pantelis N. Botsaris and P. D. Sparis, Democritus University of Thrace, Polytechnic School. The present paper describes the progress design of microcontrol- led three-way catalyst efficiency monitoring system. The system is based on a powerful microprocessor and utilizes the moving average value differential signal from a pair of thermocouples installed at the catalyst outlet and inlet sections. This signal is processed in real time using an appropriate statistical algorithm and the corresponding results are compared to experimentally determined limiting values to assess the current state of the catalyst efficiency during driving conditions. The result of this comparison is presented on a LCD dis- play as A, B, or C catalyst condition signal. The advantages and results of this new algorithm version are presented in this paper. The system has already installed at and operates on new and used cars provided that the type of catalyst used has been experimentally tested to provide the necessary limiting values that characterize its relative levels of efficiency. It can also be reprogrammed and cali- brated via a RS232C serial interface. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3241.

(P-371) Adaptive cruise control system using CVT gear ratio control. Junsuke Ino, Takeshi Ishizu , and Hideki Sudou, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.; and Akira Hino, JATCO TransTech- nology Co., Ltd. This paper describes a newly developed adaptive cruise control (ACC) system using continuously variable transmission (CVT) gear ratio control. This system provides excellent headway distance con- trol performance at a reasonable cost. With this system, headway distance is measured with a laser radar, and the throttle position and CVT gear ratio are controlled under both acceleration and decelera- tion situations. The new ACC system consists of a target headway distance cal- culator, a headway distance controller, a vehicle velocity controller and a drive torque controller. Using a drive torque control method that was newly developed based on integrated control of engine torque and the CVT gear ratio, the following benefits are obtained: (1) It provides smoother acceleration and deceleration. (2) It main- tains the target vehicle velocity on steep uphill and downhill grades. As a result, sufficient ACC performance can be attained even in 2.0-liter class vehicles. This paper describes the system features, design concept and benefits of the system, which are illustrated with simulation and experimental results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3245. (P-371) From adaptive cruise control to active safety systems. Francisco Sánchez , Marc Seguer, and Antoni Freixa, SEAT, S.A.; and Peter Andreas, Klaus Sochaski, and Rai- mond Holze, Volkswagen AG. Once the adaptive cruise control systems are already in the mar- ket in Japan and Europe, the evolution of these comfort systems is logically going towards implementing new additional functions and safety strategies in order to detect and actuate in case of emergency. This transition has to be done in clear and precise steps to assure an easy adaptation to each improvement. Driver assistance systems will play a major role in the future to minimize the risk and consequences of accidents and to increase the driving comfort level. The impact of such systems on traffic and society is briefly commented. This paper discusses the need of new driver assistance systems and a possible roadmap for them. After a short introduction of pres- ent Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and based on them, next possi- ble functions are described. Afterwards the possible technical implementation of this new advanced functions is presented, discussing the different dangerous or ambiguous scenarios against the vehicle could be faced. The nec- essary inputs to recognize the situations unequivocally are identified in order to implement a satisfactory actuation of the vehicle. According to this requirements, the characteristics demanded to the system are extracted and a possible architecture is proposed.

(P-374) A new approach to acidification in LCA. W. T. Dove and I. Boustead, Boustead Consulting Ltd. Any air emission is classified as acidic when the release of that emission causes the resultant precipitation to have a higher hydro- gen ion concentration - [H'u+ ] - than that for normal rainwater. The treatment of acidifying airborne emissions in life cycle assessment has, to date, consisted principally of globally aggregated inventory data. As such their use in calculating [H'u+ ] is inappropriate since acidification is a regional rather than a global effect. This paper sug- gests a different approach, in which standard chemistry calculation techniques are used to determine [H'u+ ] at a regional level, accounting for both variations in acid mix and local precipitation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3247. (P-374) Design for Environment (DfE) - Important tool towards an environmental efficient product development. H. Schoech, H. Florin, and M. Betz , Institute for Polymer Science and Polymer Testing, PE. Due to the fact that the requirements on the business environment of a company becomes more and more complex and dynamic, espe- cially in the automotive industry driven by new regulations like the European car take back regulation (EU directive on end-of-life (EoL) vehicles) and product responsibility, effective tools and pro- cedures along the complete product development process from research to design must be installed. Design for Recycling (DfR) and Design for Environment (DfE) tools can help to reduce the effort for environmental evaluation because of their direct integration in the designers workflow. As DfE is not standardized, it should be based on the reliable informa- tion, for example LCA data. A connection between LCA and DfE offers the possibility to integrate environmental evaluation with tolerable effort directly in the design process while keeping the transparency and reliability of LCA and fulfilling the legislative requirements for the end of life phase. 2001-01-3248. (P-374) Technologies for carbon-neutral pas- senger transport - A comparative analysis. Bengt Johansson and Max Àhman, Lund University. Road transport has become a large source of CO2 emission and accounted in 1998 for about 27% of the CO2 emission in Sweden. Efficient energy use and the use of renewable energy sources are main options for reducing CO2 emission from vehicles in the future. In this study, the use of energy carriers based on renewable energy sources in battery-powered electric vehicles (BPEVs), fuel-cell elec- tric vehicles (FCEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) is compared regarding energy efficiency, emission and cost. The cost calculations include energy, environmental and vehicle costs. The potential for non-technical measures to contribute to a reduction of road transport CO2 emission is also briefly discussed and related to the potential for technical measures. There is the potential to double the primary energy efficiency compared with the current level by utilizing vehicles with electric drivetrains. There is also major potential to increase the efficiency of conventional ICEVs. All the studied vehicles with alternative powertrains (HEVs, FCEVs, and HEVs) would have lower energy and environmental costs than the ICEV. The HEVs, FCEVs and BPEVs have, however, higher total costs than the future methanol- fueled ICEV, if the vehicle cost is added to the energy and environ- mental costs, even if significant cost reductions for key technologies such as fuel cells, batteries and fuel storages are assumed. The cost differences between the various alternatives may, however, be rela- tively small and, with regard to the major uncertainties in the cost estimates, no certain winner for the future can today be chosen among the technical options (vehicles and fuels). Several of the promising technologies are, however, dependent on the develop- ment of common core technologies such as the electric drivetrain, 392</page><page sequence="392">200 1 -0 1 -3248-200 1 -0 1 -3258 thermal gasification of biomass, improved combustion technologies and batteries. 2001-01-3249. (P-374) Fuel for tomorrows cars - Do we have to leave the hydrocarbons? Volker Schindler , Technische Univer- sität Berlin. The goal of all energy supply schemes for vehicles is to provide mechanical energy. Practical and economical reasons have made internal combustion engines the most sensible choice for many dec- ades. Now the concern about adverse effects of the liberation of fos- sil carbon into earth's atmosphere gives the critics of IC-engines a new argument for their demand to switch to alternative fuels. It is shown, that all alternatives suffer from drawbacks. Hydrocarbons should be retained as the prominent energy carrier. In order to solve the CO2 problem, the carbon in these fuels should be of non-fossil origin. This requires the synthesis of hydrocarbons. It is possible to move gradually from a fossil supply base to a non-fossil one without taking the risk of any abrupt change. 2001-01-3251.

The metal top is used for convertible cars since the exterior design when the rooftop is closed is also important. A retractable metal top system which can automatically retract and extract the metal top has been popular to increase commercial values for the luxury convertible cars. We have developed the metal top open- close system comprising metal top, package tray and luggage panel operation link-mechanism units driven by electric motors. The metal top can be retracted or extracted in approximately 25 seconds by controlling the metal top system and the side and quarter window motors. The roof panel is pre-load so that the cabin air-tightness for high-speed driving is maintained. The metal top is compactly retracted since the slide and side package trays are synchronized. Enough luggage space is secured using the multi-link mechanism to open and close the luggage panel. This retractable metal top sys- tem is equipped with the LEXUS SC430. 2001-01-3252. (P-370) Notches without notch stresses: An application of biological optimization mechanisms on engineer- ing components. M. Scherrer and C. Mattheck, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. Quite a few of the failures in engineering components are caused by stress concentrations located in notches. A reduction of these notch stresses will result in high fatigue resistance of a component. This is obtained by modifying the shape of the notch by applying a design rule which is based on the axiom of uniform stress. Using a combination of latter axiom and the finite element method, an optimization tool has been developed, which is used optimize the shape of notches. In this paper an extract of a parameter study will be presented, which compares several shoulder fillets of a shaft, which was subjected to bending, concerning the stress reduction obtained by the fillets. 2001-01-3254. (P-374) Light weight design for high-speed and MAGLEV trains. Jiirg Zehnder, Alesa Alusuisse Engineering Ltd. High-speed trains today operate at speeds between 200 and 320 km/h and MAGLEV trains between 400 and 500 km/h, whereas world record stands at 515 km/h for trains on wheels and 552 km/h for MAGLEV trains. This speed level can only be reached economi- cally when light weight design is systematically used. Low axle load is crucial for the useful life of the infrastructure and low overall weight is necessary to reduce traction power and braking efficiency. The influence of train configuration on the mass per passenger seat is shown. For a given train configuration finally light weight design is compulsory despite the fact that requirements for structural stiff- ness, sound dampening, thermal insulation and other comfort items need additional mass. A number of high-speed trains such as TGV Duplex, Talgo Pendular, ETR 500, Pendolino WCML, ICN are presented and compared with the MAGLEV train TR08. A special aspect in this comparison will be passenger safety and as part of it crashworthiness of the vehicles. Development trends for the future are given. 2001-01-3255.

This document presents the results obtained from the DATA- TREN project, the aim of which is to design an integral system to monitor and control traffic on railways with low and medium traffic density. This type of environment presents a clearly identified set of problems arising from a lack of infrastructure for systems that need to be reliable and robust. The solution lies in automating the entire control, traffic and safety system. To achieve this, various communication and distribution technologies and control systems based on fieldbuses and local area networks are used.

(P-374) Train axle detector based on signal codification with a Barker code. Jesús Ureña, Manuel Mazo, J. Jesús García, Alvaro Hernñdez, José M. Villadangos, Marta Mar- rón, Julio Pastor, Ma Soledad Escudero, and Rubén García, Univer- sity of Alcalá. This paper presents the development and implementation of an electronic axle detection system applied to trains passing a predeter- mined point on a railway. The system permits detection even if the train is traveling at a velocity of up to 350 Km/h, depending on the diameter of the train wheel. The system uses two coils placed on either side of the rail, one used as an emitter and the other as a receiver, which, as a result of the attenuation of the electromagnetic field between the coils, detect the passing of the train wheel. In con- trast to other systems with similar characteristics, in this case the signal emitted is specially coded (using a 13-bit Barker code). On reception, a correlation algorithm (implemented in an FPGA) enables the signal emitted to be detected even if there is a low sig- nal-to-noise ratio. By using this technique, the system is also able to reject a great deal of interference coming from electric motors or other electromagnetic sources. Furthermore, a slight variation of the frequency of modulation of the signal emitted allows two systems to be used with no interference between them; useful when the direction of travel has to be determined. 2001-01-3258.

Breda Kegl and Stanislav Pehan, University of Maribor. The paper discusses some aspects of injecting or adding water either into the intake air or to the fuel of a truck diesel engine in order to reduce harmful emissions. The effects of some interesting approaches of water addition are briefly discussed. On the basis of our experiments on a diesel truck engine with an in-line injection system, the following cases are considered: fuel/water emulsion injection into the combustion chamber; multi-point water injection into the air in the intake manifold; mono-point water injection before turbocharger as well as mono-point water injection after the turbocharger. For the fuel/water emulsion injection approach, the injection characteristics as well as the fuel spray characteristics are analyzed using the numerical simulation. On the basis of this analy- sis, the effects of injection and spray characteristics on emissions and other engine characteristics at several operating regimes are dis- cussed for different fuel/water ratios. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3260. (P-368) Advanced turbocharging technologies for heavy-duty diesel engines. Steve Arnold , Kevin Słupski , Mark Groskreutz, Gary Vrbas, Rob Cadle , and S. M. Shahed, Garrett Engine Boosting Systems. Heavy-duty diesel engines face increasingly stringent emissions regulations. The trade-off between fuel economy and NOx emis- sions and between NOx and particulate emissions is becoming even more critical. In the light of these regulations and the trade-off among many variables, air handling and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems become increasingly important. Three advanced tur- bocharging technologies - variable nozzle turbochargers, integral EGR pump and an ultra-high pressure ratio, long life compressor are described. In this paper, an overview of the designs and their impact on fuel economy, low speed torque, emissions and durability is described. It is shown that significant improvements in all four vari- ables are readily possible with the use of these advanced turbocharg- ing technologies. It is shown that variable nozzle (VNT) turbocharg- ing reduces smoke particularly at low speeds by a factor of 5, improves torque at low engine speeds and improves fuel economy by about 3%. It is shown that the IEGR pump enables EGR without increasing back pressure on the engine. Finally, the ultra-high pres- sure ratio, long life compressor is shown to supply high pressure ratios (5-6: 1) with wide flow range and fatigue life increases by fac- tors of 100 or more. Later publications will present these three tech- nologies individually and in greater detail. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3262. (P-368) Cycle-to-cycle diesel combustion char- acterization during engine transient operation. J. Galindo, V. Bermúdez, J. R. Serrano, and J. J. López, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia. In the paper is described how to characterize the combustion pro- cess of a high-speed turbocharged direct injection diesel engine (HSDI) during a transient process, which consists on a full load acceleration at constant engine speed, known as load transient. The combustion characterization is based on the cycle-to-cycle combus- tion analysis and the Rate of Heat Release calculation (RoHR). The information presented in the paper includes, the transient recorded data at three different engine speeds joint with information about transducers characteristics and measurement frequencies. The post-processing of the obtained information and its synchronization is described in detail; a protocol of the process is finally obtained. The RoHR of every transient cycle is calculated and shown as final objective of the work. To conclude, relevant information about mechanical efficiency, maximum in-cylinder pressure, diesel com- bustion phases starting and duration is also obtained from the tran- sient process analysis by means of a combustion diagnostic code. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3263. (P-368) A new combustion chamber concept for low emissions in small DI diesel engines. Rahman Md. Monta- jir, Hideyuki Tsunemoto, Hiromi Ishitani, Tsukamoto Koji, and Kubo Kenichi, Kitami Institute of Technology. This study proposes a new combustion chamber concept for small DI diesel engines. Reduction of fuel adhering to the cavity wall, improvements in mixture formation, and an optimum distribu- tion of mixture inside and outside the cavity are the main character- istics of the combustion chamber. The spray formation and its distribution inside and outside the combustion chamber was investigated photographically in a small DI diesel engine with transparent cylinder and piston. Optimization of the fuel spray distribution inside and outside the cavity was attempted by changing the shape of the cavity entrance and the loca- tion where spray impinges on the lip. In addition improvements in the mixture formation of the impinging spray and reductions in the fuel adhering to the cavity wall were attempted by introducing a small step on the cavity side wall. The results were confirmed by analyzing the combustion and emission in an actual DI diesel engine. Especially the effects of the entrance and side wall shapes were evaluated by measuring the HC, NOx, and smoke emissions. It was concluded that a round lip and spray impingement just on the lip can reduce HC and smoke emis- sions by 30% compared with a conventional cylindrical cavity. Moreover a 40% improvement in the HC and smoke emission is achieved with a slight penalty in NOx emissions if a small step is placed at the cavity side wall. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3264. (P-368) The influence of regulating parameters of dual-fuel compression ignition engine fueled with LPG on its maximum torque, overall efficiency and emission. Stawomir Luft, Radom Technical University. In the Department of IC Engines and Automobiles in Radom Technical University, CI engine has been modified to dual fueling. As a main fuel liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is used. The diesel fuel is used to initiate combustion. Some investigation of standard diesel engine and modified one has been carried out. Tests of the engines consisted of preparation of load characteris- tics for some different ignition diesel fuel doses and for different injection timing of ignition dose. The emission of exhaust gases has been measured during examination of the engines. It was noticed that the volume of ignition diesel oil dose and injection timing strongly influences overall efficiency, maximum engine torque and emissions. The investigation results obtained for modified and standard engine has been compared. These results let to optimized two regu- lation parameters - the volume of diesel oil dose and its injection timing from the point of view of maximum torque, overall effi- ciency and emissions. 2001-01-3265. (P-368) A detailed phenomenological model for wall heat transfer prediction in diesel engines. C. Eiglmeier, H. Lettmann, G. Stiesch, and G. P. Merker, University of Hanover. A phenomenological heat transfer model for direct injection die- sel engines has been developed. Utilizing the thermodynamic results of a combustion model as an input, the model is able to predict the 394</page><page sequence="394">2001-01-3265-2001-01-3278 temporal variation of the heat losses from the cylinder gas to the cyl- inder walls. Additionally, the division into isothermal combustion chamber subsurfaces allows the consideration of the spatial varia- tion of the wall heat fluxes. The physical mechanisms such as flow dependent convection, heat radiation due to hot soot particles and isolation effects of deposited soot layers are described in detail. Thus, the effects of these mechanisms on the overall heat transfer can be studied. The heat transfer model was verified successfully by comparison to measured wall heat fluxes in a single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine. It is shown that the effects of engine speed and load, turbo-charging and soot deposition can be predicted with good accuracy. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3266. (P-372) Polytopic dynamics and control for variable suspension system. Du Wang , Tokyo Institute of Technol- ogy; Zhongyang Guo, Harbin Institute of Technology; and Ichiro Hagiwara, Tokyo Institute of Technology. This study is motivated from the investigation of vehicle suspen- sion system with changeable damping and variant stiffness parame- ters. Such suspension system can be modeled as a dynamic polytope based on the mapping of affinely changed parameters. According to the polytopic dynamics decomposition, knowledge of linear time invariant system can be applied to each polytope vertex and the time variant system is solved by the polytope convex synthesis method. For time variant vehicle suspension system, the different model structures for control purposes are formulated. A quarter-car is taken as the example for demonstration in observer design and nonlinear control design. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3269. (P-372) Hybrid control of a semi-active sus- pension system. Cédic Nouillant , PSA Peugeot Citroën ; and Xavier Moreau and Alain Oustaloup , Université Bordeaux I. Mechatronic subsystems are being developed more and more in automotive industry due to their better performance compared to passive components. In this paper, a semi-active suspension system and its control is studied. A feedback control of the suspension sys- tem of a quarter car model is described and CRONE methodology applied. As a suspension system design results from a compromise between contradictory goals, an optimal problem is given which provides two CRONE controllers, each with its own strategy. A hybrid control is then introduced to switch between strategies, and refined to reduce switching bump. Control stability is proved using a global Lyapunov function. 2001-01-3270. (P-372) Estimation of dynamic qualities of undercarriage machines. Borislav Benchev , Higher School of Transport; and Sofron Sofronov, Ministry of Transport. The dynamic qualities are examined theoretically with designing new machines or by experiment for the existing transport machines. The methods used to estimate them are based on the assumption that the resistance with running is a constant quantity or it changes only according to the speed of movement. The influence of road condi- tions and of the loading and speed operation modes is not com- pletely taken into account that reduces the accuracy of the estima- tion. The paper presents methods of estimating the undercarriage machine dynamic qualities considering the multi-factor influence of the operation conditions on the energy losses. 2001-01-3271. (P-368) The new 'torque strategy'for the con- trol of the spark ignition engine - Development of a motorized butterfly valve through experimental techniques and computa- tional modeling. R. Royo , J. M. Corberá , and L. Azara, Universi- dad Politécnica de Valencia; and E. Marcheguet, P. Gruchet, R. Terol, and J. A. González , RENAULT ESPAÑa. In this paper a torque strategy used by RENAULT for the control of a spark ignition engine is presented. With this new strategy for engine control, it was necessary to develop a new motorized butter- fly valve. The design and development of this element is described in the paper. This research was carried out through the application of both modeling techniques using computational tools and experi- mental techniques on the steady flow rig and the engine bench. 2001-01-3273. (P-368) Visualization and PIV measurements of in-cylinder axisymmetric flows. Dean Vucinic, Birinichi K. Hazarika, and Cristian Dinescu, Vrije Universiteit Brüssel. The in-cylinder flow in axisymmetric geometries and the flow through the inlet valve for steady and unsteady conditions are inves- tigated and experimental results are presented. Two test rigs were used for flow visualization studies and PIV measurements of the cylinder equipped with central valve: (i) for the steady flow through the inlet valve and (ii) for special monocylinder transient water ana- log for in-cylinder flow study. The similarities and the differences of the flow fields in the two test rigs are discussed on the basis of the performed experiments. 2001-01-3276.

Seccar dini, Centro Ricerche FIAT. The customer increased sensitivity to air quality problem and the natural influence of smell on human behavior affect the purchasing decision as the opinion on the vehicle quality during its life. So the olfactory quality is an even more important issue. Since the early 80s the car manufacturers have been working on the olfactory quality assessment using panel tests with trained or untrained sniffers. The subjective tests are expensive and require a not negligible time to be organized. The Centro Ricerche FIAT evaluated the applicability of an electronic nose to assess the odor quality and compared the obtained results with the votes of a jury. 2001-01-3277. (P-371) On-board injection rate measurements at DI-systems with a micromachined mass flow sensor. Ulrich Schmid, R. Hoffmann, and G. Krötz, EADS Deutschland GmbH; and D. Schmitt-Landsiedel, Technical University Munich. We have developed a micromachined mass flow sensor placed on a high pressure stable substrate to measure on board the different injection quantities needed in modern direct injection (DI) systems for optimum performance. To detect the injection end/begin as well as the injection rate as fast and precisely as possible, a flow sensor is for the first time completely integrated into the nozzle body very close to the injection holes. The thermal measurement principle is chosen, as both gasoline and diesel fuel quantities can be detected and therefore, the use of this present flow sensor is not restricted to one of these different types of combustion engines. In this paper, the fabrication process of the first prototypes is reported mainly focus- ing on the technology for the LTC (Low Temperature Cofired) ceramics. Additionally, FEM simulations on the velocity profile in the injection nozzle are performed to calculate in a further step the power consumption Pelee of the thin film resistor during operation at different overheat ratios. Finally, the first injection rate measure- ments up to 60 MPa are presented, discussed and compared to sig- nals gained from an injection amount indicator integrated in the high pressure hydraulic test bench. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3278.

Replacing the traditional camshaft of spark ignition engines by a variable valve actuation (EVA) system promises noticeable fuel savings and substantial improvement of the motor torque. Up to now, all known electromagnetic EVA systems apply one bulky cen- tral electronic control unit (ECU) together with complex wiring har- 395</page><page sequence="395">2001-01-3278-2001-01-3285 ness. A mechatronic approach for such system, where each actuator is joint together with its own control electronics, offers substantial performance and cost benefits. Extraordinary environmental condi- tions arise for such a mechatronic system which is directly mounted on the cylinder head of the engine. Ambient temperatures up to 125°C together with vibrations, which are generated by the impact of the armature of the electromagnetic actuator, ask for a new assembly technique of the electronic. This paper describes the sys- tematic approach for the design of such complex mechatronic sys- tem. Simulation methods for the different mechanical, electrical and thermal aspects and their interaction will be discussed. Measured data for the different subjects and comparisons with the simulations will be presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3280. (P-373) Catalytic decomposition of nitric oxide in an oxygen rich environment. James Thomson, Philip J. C. Ans - tice, Richard D. Price, and Steven P. Scott, University of Dundee; and David Hutson, Amcet Ltd., University of Dundee. An initial study to search out a catalytic method of removing oxides of nitrogen in an oxygen rich gas effluent has been per- formed. The system demonstrates the capability to mount a two- stage reactor system to decompose nitric oxide in dioxygen, where stage 1 converts nitric oxide to oxidizing NOx molecules, and stage 2 performs the catalytic decomposition of the NOx species to dinitrogen and dioxygen. The study has confirmed that a palladium- zinc catalyst supported on a gadolinium stabilized zirconia system has the capability to oxidize nitrogen(II) oxide to oxides of nitrogen (N &gt;+2 ). The results show that the catalytic strategy for oxidizing the relatively unreactive nitrogen(II) oxide to the strong oxidant nitrogen(&gt;II) oxides, with the subsequent decomposition of reactive NOx species using a sacrificial metal substrate is feasible. The study confirms that there is competitive adsorption between nitrogen(II) oxide and dioxygen for the adsorption sites available at the catalyst surface. Modification of the activity of the catalyst to generate higher oxides of nitrogen can be induced by the application of a neg- ative bias to the catalyst bed. The study also investigates the ability of a solid state electrolytic cell coated with a tin or rhodium-tin cou- ple to decompose a feed of nitrogen oxides of nitrogen oxidation states &gt; 2. The results confirm that the application of a negative bias to a sacrificial electrode can stabilize the electrode against oxidation and hence insure its continuing ability to convert NOx eluent to dinitrogen and dioxygen. The study shows that the applied polarity to the electrode is critical, such that deactivation of the electrode occurs if it is placed under a positive bias. 2001-01-3281. (P-373) Electrochemical NOx sensors for emis- sion control of automotive exhaust gas. Maria Luisa Grilli, Narin Kaabbuathong, Atanu Dutta, Elisabetta Di Bartolomeo, and Enrico Traversa, Università di Roma "Tor Vergata'. Electrochemical NOx sensors for emission control of automotive exhaust gas were prepared coupling pellets of y ttria- stabilized zirco- nia (YSZ), an oxygen ion conductor, with thick films of a semicon- ducting oxide (WO3) as an auxiliary phase. The obtained sensors were wholly exposed to the same atmosphere. Electromotive force (EMF), polarization curves and amperometric measurements were performed in air and at different concentrations of NO2 in air, at selected temperatures. Stable EMF values and fast response times were obtained. The sensors showed non-linear polarization curves. The role played by the electrolyte/electrode interface was deter- mined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests: exposure to NO2 did not affect the bulk but only the electrolyte/ electrode interface. 2001-01-3282. (P-373) Co-acting of fuel supply cut-off tech- nique and oxidation catalyst in order to emission reduction from diesel engine. Zbigniew Zmudka, Stefan Postrzednik, and Adam Ciesiolkiewicz, Silesian University of Technology. Within carried-out investigations operation of compression- ignition engines were analyzed in respect of toxic substances emis- sion. The tested engines are used among other things as a drive of mining locomotives and city buses, so experiments were aimed at verifying if the engines meet very strict mining emission standards. In the paper, a method of considerable carbon monoxide emission reduction in the whole operation range of the diesel engine is pres- ented. Proposed conception consists in co-acting of fuel supply cut- off technique and oxidation catalytic converter. Cutting off fuel sup- ply to selected cylinders of the engine (disconnection of the cylin- ders) is applied at low as well as mean loads and catalyst works effectively in the range of high loads. The paper contains experi- mental results of the modified diesel engine in which cylinders dis- connection method and oxidation catalyst are commonly applied. 2001-01-3283. (P-373) A method of reducing the exhaust emissions from DI diesel engines by the introduction of a fuel cut-off system during cold start. Piotr Bielaczyc, BOSMAL Auto- motive R&amp;D Centre ; and Jersy Merkisz and Jacek Pielecha, Poznan University of Technology. This paper reviews the exhaust emissions from direct injection (DI) diesel engines in the initial period following start-up. The tests were undertake in 'cold start' mode (the temperature of the cooling water and lube oil being equal to the ambient temperature) and 'warm start'modes (after achieving a state of equilibrium). The results from both states are compared. Exhaust emissions in the period from cold start is very important and must be improved in order to satisfy present day standards worldwide. A significant emission decrease during cold start can be achieved by incorporat- ing selective fuel cut-off during the few seconds directly after begin- ning of engine crank. Compared to the acceptable gaseous pollutant concentrations, it was observed that an almost 50% reduction in hydrocarbon emission and a 30% reduction in carbon monoxide emissions were obtained (3 minutes of idle run). For the other test variants (warm start and heated catalyst) products of incomplete combustion were eliminated as the result of catalyst reactor action - carbon monoxide emission was minimal, and HC and PM emission was considerably restricted. The decrease in emissions was the result of higher engine temperature and hence better combustion conditions. The upward trend in the exhaust emission levels was caused by a gradual decrease in catalyst temperature caused by engine idle. 2001-01-3284.

In the Metalworking Industry the design and the control of the processes have been traditionally based on the experience and, sometimes, considered as an art. The application of numerical meth- ods reduces the costs of the design and elaboration processes and contributes to the improvement of the product quality. In this work the authors present the simulation of the cold compaction of a two- level powder metallurgical part using a commercial FEM code.

Selectively densified rollers from Distaloy DC-1, Astaloy Mo and Distaloy AE have been rolling contact fatigue (RCF) tested on a ZF-test rig. The rolling contact fatigue endurance limit of the Astaloy Mo-based material is approximately 1500 MPa that can be compared to the selected reference material, AISI 5115 (DIN 16MnCr5), 1600 MPa. For the diffusion-alloyed materials, Distaloy DC1 and Distaloy AE, it was not possible to determine the endur- ance limit due to too few tests. However, the endurance limit seems to be slightly lower than the Astaloy Mo material.

(P-371) Driver eye movement during a route navigation information search. Guangyan Li and Helen Middle- ton, University of Sunderland. In-vehicle route navigation systems are used by an increasing number of drivers throughout the world. These systems are intended to assist the driver in the driving task by providing real-time naviga- tional instructions. However, most route navigation systems appear to have been developed on the basis of technical features, rather than from a usability/human factors viewpoint, causing concerns over their safety implications, especially for older drivers. An experimental study was carried out to test drivers' preference of markers in an electronic map display. This was done by analyzing drivers eye fixation and movement during information searching in a number of route navigation tasks. The study indicates that, in order to find the 'correct' road during a navigational search, participants adopt visual search strategies in which they tend to fixate, initially on text road identification markers, followed by glances to numeric and symbolic road markers. There was also significant interaction between marker type and map orientation for their influences on eye fixation. It is anticipated that by taking the driver preference for road marker type into consideration in the design of in-vehicle route dis- plays, the system will be used more efficiently. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3289. (P-374) Hybrid vehicles: Hope or hype? Hans Besse ling and Leo Schlösser, Ministry of Transport. What is to be expected from the current technology push to intro- duce electric-hybrid vehicles onto the market? This article addresses the question what role national governments should or should not play in the introduction of this new technology. In The Netherlands a plan was devised to support the introduction of EHV's onto the market. Three projects from this 'Masterplan EHV' show that suc- cessful implementation of new technology is still largely a matter of peoples' reaction and behavior. The program has therefore shifted its emphasis from 'putting technology in the streets' to: 'creating a chance for new technologies to take a hold.' Whether national gov- ernments should take the US approach of 'technology driven' subsi- dies, or the 'European' approach of 'policy forced' tax reductions is discussed here. 2001-01-3290. (P-374) How to improve hybrid vehicles for environmental sustainability. A case study of their impact. Antonio Mattucci, ENEA ; and Mario Conte and Giovanni Pede, Ministry of Transport. ENEA is studying innovative vehicles such as pure electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, aiming to increase their energy efficiency and to reduce pollutant emissions. As part of such activities, a quite large demonstration project for verifying technical and economical viability of hybrid buses under real public transport operation condi- tions, has been carried out. Furthermore, a controller for an electric hybrid vehicle has been developed that allows to achieve a further 30% fuel economy improvement. The results of such activities are the input information of the TREMO VE model to investigate the potential impact of electric hybrid vehicle deployment in an Italian city, as a case study. The positive effects of new hybrid vehicle introduction for freight transport in terms of fuel saving and emis- sion reduction, have been also investigated. 2001-01-3291. (P-374) Comparative LCA of electric mopeds versus internal combustion mopeds. Andrea Caizzi and Pierpaolo Girardi, CESI. Mopeds offer advantages in urban areas with traffic congestion and parking problems. Moreover, Electric Mopeds are No Emission Vehicles and therefore they do not increase urban atmospheric pol- lution. Their use, however, does imply some trade-off effects. The present study was developed by CESI for ENEL (the most important Italian company in electric power generation) and had the aim of comparing the environmental performance of electric mopeds versus traditional internal combustion engine mopeds fueled with RFG 1% benzene. To allow a complete analysis of the environmental impacts consequent to the use of the two alternative vehicles, a comparative LCA was performed. The vehicles consid- ered were a moped 50-cm3 4-stroke, and the corresponding electric model, equipped with advanced lead-acid batteries. 2001-01-3292.

(P-374) Examining the ideal level of use for replacement of heavy goods vehicles for Middle and West Delta Mills Company. Fathy El-Sayed A. Al-Tony, Egyptian National Institute for Transport; and Sherif Younis Tawfik, Middle and West Delta Mills Company. Middle and West Delta Mills Company (MWDMC) was first established as a public sector company in 1967. In 1991, it became a public enterprise company according to Law number 159/1991. The activities of the company comprise wheat milling and distribu- tion, bread and pasta making, and wheat storage. These activities involve moving a substantial amount of raw materials and products, which is carried out by road transport. The company has its own fleet of heavy goods vehicles that serves transport activities in the company. This research paper aims at identifying the optimum level of use for replacement of heavy goods vehicles of Middle and West Delta Mills Company (MWDMC). In addition, the paper aims to identify and develop models that express the behavior of vehicle mainte- nance cost with vehicle age. First, the paper identifies vehicle replacement policy determina- tion and reviews replacement criteria of heavy goods vehicles. Then the Total Cost Technique (TCT) is used to identity the optimum level of use for replacement for a selected sample representing the MWDMC fleet. Maintenance cost is considered to be the vital cost component that affects the life of vehicles. So, maintenance cost data collected for the selected sample of vehicles is used to develop statistical rela- tionships that express the behavior of maintenance cost as a function of vehicle age. This is carried out for different vehicle types using regression analysis. The analysis showed that the ideal level of vehicle age ranges between 7 and 9 years according to the vehicle type. In addition, the relationship between vehicle maintenance cost and vehicle age was found to be reasonably expressed by the exponential equation. 2001-01-3294.

(P-370) Machining of advanced materials for automotive components. V. Diaz , M. H. Miguelez, J. L. Cantero , and G. Filippone, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Particulate-reinforced metal matrix composites (PMMCs) based on aluminum alloys are used in automotive industry because of their low cost and improved mechanical properties at high temperature. Automotive producers are testing prototypes in aluminum PMMCs such as brake disk and drum, calipers, piston and cylinder liners. For many components the production of a good surface finish is essen- tial and therefore will necessitate some machining. The presence of hard abrasive ceramic particulates results in rapid tool wear and high machining cost. Today, this cost-effective problem is the main obstacle to aluminum PMMCs wider acceptance in the automotive market. Machining practices have not been optimized, but some studies has stated that roughing with carbide tools (especially uncoated WC tools) and finishing with polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tools are the most economical way in machining aluminum PMMCs. This paper presents results about the factors affecting tool wear when machining with different carbide tools, in order to esti- mate their influence in the cost of machining this class of materials. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3298. (P-370) Studies on epoxy resin used in fiber- reinforced polymer composites. C. Kaynak, A. Ozturk, and T. Tincer, Middle East Technical Univ. The purpose of this study was to investigate the behavior of brit- tle epoxy resin when modified by liquid rubber for higher flexibility and toughness. The resin and the liquid rubber used were diglycidyl ether of bisphenol- A (DGEB A) and hydroxyl terminated polybutad- iene (HTPB), respectively. A silane coupling agent (SCA) was also utilized to improve the compatibility of HTPB and epoxy matrix. Four groups of specimens were prepared by using different orders of mixing of HTPB with SCA and hardener. Tension, bending and impact tests results indicated that strength and impact toughness val- ues were increased in the specimens containing 1% HTPB and 2% SCA. Specimens containing HTPB rubber had highest flexibility than neat epoxy specimens. SEM studies indicated the formation of rubber domains and deformation lines in the epoxy matrix, which assessed the improvement in flexibility and toughness. 2001-01-3299. (P-374) Affordable and sustainable urban pub- lic transport. David J. Low , Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh. The goal of any transport system is to provide us all with increased personal freedom and mobility. The car has played a sig- nificant role in helping to achieve this goal. However, in urban areas the car alone is not a sustainable option. Increased car use has resulted in congestion, pollution and an increase in death and injury. In urban areas an efficient and popular public transport system is essential. Rail-based systems have a particularly important role to play in larger urban areas. Numerous cities have identified rail- based public transport systems as providing the ideal solution to their transport problems. However, in many cases, the enormous capital costs of such systems have proved an insurmountable barrier. In this paper, we suggest how these capital costs could be signifi- cantly reduced by moving the power source onto the vehicle. The resulting reduction in infrastructure costs could allow many more cities to construct the rail-based public transport systems they desire, and the market for light rail vehicles will grow. 2001-01-3300.

(P-374) Full-scale test on a railroad section under realistic strain-time-history. A. De Iorio , M. Florio , D. Ian- niello , R. Iannuzzi, and F. Penta , University of Naples Federico II. The design optimization of a track structure requires the knowing of the realistic service loads, obtainable by means of 'on-track tests. 'The track design is obviously based on the static and dynamic load distribution applied to the rails, but also depends on the distribution of these loads through the rails and then to a number of sleepers. Moreover, there are effects of the rail stiffness and trackbed modu- lus influencing the forces which should be applied in a laboratory test. The knowledge is of great importance when, for example, one has to deal with the testing of new rail fastening assemblies. How- ever in-service tests show two big drawbacks. The first is involved with the stopping of the traffic on line which must be planned and managed within a short time; the second is related to the impossibil- ity of leading the system parameters close to their critical values to point out the mechanical strength of the adopted structural compo- nents. To overcome these problems, even if in a partial way, a full- scale testing machine has been designed and built at the Department of Design and Industrial Management of the University of Naples. The aim is to reproduce real strain-time history recorded during 'on- track tests'and the relative movement of the rail to the sleepers. Also a numerical model has been set up for a better understanding of the stress-strain history and subsequently forecasts the critical condi- tions in the fastening systems. The present work has been developed within a research project whose goals are: 1. to establish design parameters in order to develop new or improved railtrack compo- nents; 2. to verify the performance of new or existing railtrack com- ponents; 3. to provide data which may be used to improve laboratory test methods; 4. solving specific local problems. 2001-01-3303. (P-368) New methodology for power train development in the automotive engineering - Integration of sim- ulation, design and testing. Albert Albers, Marc Albrecht , Arne Krüger , and Ralph Lux , University of Karlsruhe. The purpose of the Institute of Machine Design and Automotive Engineering at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany is to carry out power train engineering as a closed process by means of modern design methodology. Because vehicles become more and more com- plex and the interaction of their different sub-systems is increasing, the integrated consideration of the complete system, sub-systems, parts and elements is one precondition in order to achieve a product development process that is as optimal as possible.

(P-372) Semi-active steering wheel for steer- by-wire system. Youngjin Park , Korea Advanced Institute of Sci- ence and Technology; and Inyong Jung , Hyundai Motor Co. Conventional steering system has a mechanical connection between the driver and the front tires of the vehicle, but in steer-by- wire system, there is no such a connection. Instead, actuators, posi- tioned in the vehicle's front corners receive input from the control module and turn the front wheels accordingly. In steer-by-wire sys- tem, steering wheel is an important part that not only transfers driv- er' s steering input to the controller but also provides a road feedback feeling to the driver's hand. Thus the reactive torque actuator, pro- viding road feedback, plays an important role in steer-by-wire sys- tem. In conventional steer-by-wire-system, a motor was used as a reactive torque actuator. But using motor has some disadvantages such as an oscillatory feeling, and improper and potentially danger- ous acceleration of the steering wheel by the motor when driver's hands are released from steering wheel abruptly. In this study, we developed a semi-active steering wheel with two magneto- rheological brakes used for reactive torque generation to eliminate inherent safety problem of the motor-based active steering wheel. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3307.

A nonlinear model with coupled inputs is considered and a suitable transformation is applied to deal with the nonlinearities. Nonlinear sliding surfaces are designed using Ly apuno v approach to deal with the nonlinear effects. Simula- tion results are given to show that the designed controller is effective. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3308. (P-372) Non-linear neuro control for active steering for various road conditions. Akihiko Shimura and Kazuo Yoshida, Keio Univ. To develop a front steering control system, a nonlinear steering control law is necessary, since the dynamical characteristics of cars are nonlinear at the situation of large side slip angle and high yaw rate. The robustness to the change of friction coefficient 'x is required on the controller. In this study, an intelligent control of front wheel steering is presented. The controller consists of 2 neural network controllers for specific values of [i and an integrator under the Cubic Neural Network (CNN) architecture. The neural networks are designed with error back propagation learning. By using the CNN architecture, the controller can adapt to various values of p. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the present active steering method are demonstrated by numerical simulations using simple 8DOF model and DADS full-vehicle model. 2001-01-3309. (P-367) Development of a static assessment rig. Jim Kerr and Paul Gambrell , Motability. Some Mobility Centers in the UK which are accredited to carry out disabled driver assessments for those disabled people who would like to drive a vehicle use Static Assessment Rigs (S ARs) for part of the assessment process. Each of these S ARs is of different design and each use various units of measurement. Subsequently, to date in the UK, there has been no consistent method for measur- ing and recording certain vital information whilst carrying out the assessment of disabled drivers. To overcome the anomalies described and to introduce a consistent and valid methodology for one very important element of driver assessment, the Forum of Mobility Centers' in partnership with Motability, a charity which, provides vehicles for many disabled people in the UK, decided to embark on a program, to design and develop a SAR that could be used in each of the accredited Mobility Center's located throughout the UK. This paper discusses aspects of the project process; the specifica- tions arrived at, the development, proving, manufacture and provi- sion of SARs and how these objectives were achieved. 2001-01-3311. (P-367) Quantitative analysis of the relation- ship between driver's behavior and vehicle motion - Effect of seat positions on driver's behavior. Yuzuru Matsuura, Osaka Sangyo University. We paid attention to the correlations of individual driver's behavior, the vehicle motion and the road environment, and con- ducted the travel experiments to investigate the characteristics of the driver's operation behavior. Driver's behavior was shot by CCD cameras set in the cabin, and the vehicle motion was simultaneously taken by digital video cameras set on the test course. We analyzed quantitatively both movements using the three-dimensional image processing system. As the result, driver's behavior affected by his setup seat position was made clear quantitatively as shown in the moving traces of his body and arms. 2001-01-3312. (P-367) Dynamic analysis of ELR retractor spoolout. Steven E. Meyer , David Hock , Brian Herbst , and Stephen Forrest , Safety Analysis and Forensic Engineering. Contemporary production emergency locking seatbelt retractors (ELRs) have been proven very effective in the crash environment for which they have been primarily designed and most adequately tested, that is, in the full frontal crash mode. However, researchers have documented spool out during offset, angled, override, under- ride, and rollover crashes where seatbelt retractors are subject to acceleration pulses in varying directions, including the vertical plane. Occupant motions during these real-world accident modes may also impart loads into the belts and belt hardware (webbing and buckle assemblies) that may not be immediately apparent in the frontal barrier test mode. Numerous laboratory studies have demon- strated that the inertial sensor can be held in the neutral position when an overriding opposing force is applied to the retractor, result- ing in webbing spool out. Various ELR designs include ball and cage sensors, pendulum, and disk systems. These authors have mounted various typical production ELR- type retractors to testing apparatus capable of applying acceleration pulses in various directions. These experiments demonstrate, via high-speed video, the potential for belt spool out with an opposing, overriding force. Moreover, these experiments, when considered with respect to real-world out-of-plane crashes, explain the signifi- cant belt spool out documented in the field. 2001-01-3313. (P-367) Determining crash data using camera matching photogrammetric technique. Stephen Fenton, William Neale , Nathan Rose , and Christopher Hughes , Knott Laboratory, Inc. Accident scene photographs contain important information that can be useful in determining how accidents happened. However, dimensions are difficult to gather from photographs. The size of an object in the photographs depends on how far away from the camera the object is located. An object in the background looks smaller and will measure smaller than the same size object in the foreground. This phenomenon is called perspective distortion. Photogrammetry was introduced in the late 1800' s as a tool to compensate for the perspective distortion and assist in gathering dimensions from photographs. One of the early techniques was to create a transparent miniature of a photograph and place the minia- ture in the view screen on the camera. The camera was then taken 399</page><page sequence="399">2001-01-3313-2001-01-3321 to the scene and matched to the correct position such that the image in the scene matched the image in the view screen. Today, using computer modeling software, a scene can be created in the computer model that matches the actual photograph. Using a technique called camera matching, the camera in the computer can be adjusted to match the photograph. Once properly matched, dimensions within the photograph can be gathered. This technique is useful in gather- ing dimensional data from crash scene photographs like the point of impact and the point of rest of crash vehicles. Once the crash scene dimensions are determined, the accident can be reconstructed using the principals of conservation of momentum and energy. 2001-01-3314. (P-367) A study on deformation behavior of vehicle cabin and safety belt using a most probable optimal design method. Ichiro Hagiwara and Q. Shi , Tokyo Institute of Technology. The design of automobile human safety is a very important design factor, which the car manufacturers have recently focused. Crash tests have provided information on dummy response mea- surements such as the maximum chest acceleration, head injury criteria (HIC) value and femur loading. The subject of this research is an optimal design of the seat belt in consideration of the deforma- tion behavior of a vehicle cabin with the aim of reducing the human injury. The research focuses on the optimization method of taking the comprehensive trade off between the global approximation and computational cost. The optimization approach called Most Proba- ble Optimal Design (MPOD) proposed by the authors is modified to be applicable to the optimization of cabin crash deformation behavior and safety belt with the mixed discrete and continuous design variables. The application example of the Hybrid III dummy model shows that the MPOD technique is effective in saving the computational cost. 2001-01-3316. (P-371) Application of loop shaping H-infinity control to diesel engine anti-oscillation strategy. Peter G. Scotson and Xiao-Dong Sun , TRW Automotive; and Graham Balfour , Delphi Diesel Systems. The control of fuel delivery to minimize drivetrain oscillations is a major benefit to vehicle refinement and driveability. This paper describes the application of robust H-infinity loop-shaping control to the speed-fuel control loop. A one-degree-of-freedom controller structure (feedback only) is examined and applied to a small passen- ger car. Using careful implementation, the control algorithm is of low order and efficient requiring only limited microprocessor resources. The robust controller gives excellent performance when operated synchronously to engine rotation, where the dynamics become speed-dependent. Alternatively it can be operated satisfactorily at a fixed sample rate, asynchronous to engine rotation. The design is found to be eminently suitable for production. 2001-01-3317. (P-373) Modeling the exhaust system in two- stroke small engines. A. J. Torregrosa , J. Galindo, R. Payri, and H. Climent, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia ; and C. Gaia, Nacional Motor S.A. The purpose of this paper is to describe a methodology based on experimental and theoretical studies for the modeling of typical exhaust systems used in two-stroke small engines. The steady and dynamic behaviors of these systems have been measured in a flow test rig and in an impulse test rig, respectively. Information obtained from these experiments is used in two ways: to find a suitable geo- metric model to be used in a finite-difference scheme code, and to provide a mean pressure and a frequency domain reflecting bound- ary, in the frame of a hybrid method. A complete 50cc engine was modeled and comparisons between predicted and measured instan- taneous pressure at the exhaust port show a fair agreement, the results of the hybrid approach being more accurate. 2001-01-3318. (P-373) Determination of polyaromatic hydro- carbons in particulate matter with HPLC and 3D detector. Tomonori Takada, Hiroshi Ikezawa, and Yasuhiro Kotani, Petro- leum Energy Center. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a three- dimensional fluorescence detector (3D detector) was applied for the specification of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in particulate matter (PM) emitted from tailpipe emissions. Fourteen standard PAHs including Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and one nitro-PAH (1-Nitropyrene) were examined for the repeatability and limit of detection (LOD) for the HPLC instrument in the test laboratory using the CARB method. The LODs for five PAHs including B(a)P and 1-Nitropyrene were low enough (less than 0.2 ng/ml). The detailed B(a)P analysis with 3D-chromatograms was carried out to examine the existence of unknown compounds in the peak of B(a)P. Four excitation wavelengths were selected for the detection of the B(a)P in the real PM samples according to the shape of the spec- trum for standard B(a)P and these analytical values were compared each other. Some obvious differences were observed among these four values responding to the change of the spectrum shapes. It is proposed that the lowest value among four datapoints should be used for the analytical result because this value must be less inter- fered by other unknown compounds. 2001-01-3320. (P-373) A novel interface for linear oxygen sensors. Stephan Bolz, Siemens VDO Automotive AG. The precise, fast and wide range measurement of exhaust gas oxygen concentration is a key element to the development of low emissions combustion engines. This is true to Gasoline Direct Inject and Common-Rail Diesel engines, but even standard Multi-Port Injection (MPI) engines benefit from a better lambda control (SULEV applications). The proliferation of linear oxygen sensors has up to now been hindered by a lack of compatibility of sensors/interface electronics among different suppliers, keeping the cost high. The newly developed Siemens interface electronics brings down that barrier, giving the car manufacturers the freedom of choice among different sensor suppliers, reducing the effort mainly to soft- ware adaptation. The sensor interface is a self-contained integrated circuit with minimum external components for additional sensor adaptation. It has built-in diagnostics, full sensor protection, and is controlled by an external microcontroller. 2001-01-3321. (P-371) Advances and challenges in BBW AWB dispulsion for future automotive vehicles. Bogdan Fijał- kowski, Krakow University of Technology. Current implementation of novel advanced electro-mechanically (E-M) activated brake-by- wire (BBW) all-wheel-driveable (AWB) dispulsion mechatronic control hyposystems may be comparatively costly. Though, as the cost of macroelectronic commutator (macro- com-mutator) and microelectronic processor (microprocessor- based controllers becomes increasingly cheap, fixed with bettered short-stroke linear brake-force-actuator motors, novel advanced E-M-activated BBW AWB dispulsion mechatronic control hyposystems become a potential practical choice in the not-too- distant future. The size and mass of these short-stroke tubular linear DC- AC macrocommutator brake-force-actuator E-M motors may be comparatively small and light, respectively, in the nearest future with bettered interior permanent magnet (IPM) materials. Specific advantages of the novel advanced E-M-activated BBW AWB dis- pulsion mechatronic control hyposystem are cleanliness, lack of fluid and flexibility. This paper presents a very advanced anti-lock and/or anti-spin BBW AWB dispulsion mechatronic control hyposystem with E-M- activated friction disc, ring and/or drum brakes for controlling not only the braking forces during normal riding and cornering but also 400</page><page sequence="400">2001-01-3321-2001-01-3330 the braking forces between the inner and outer motorized and/or generatorized wheels (M&amp;GW) in a hard turn independently. 2001-01-3322.

Mohammad Durali and Ali Reza Kassaiezadeh, Sharif University of Technology. A neural network model of a full car has been developed here on the basis of ADAMS simulation results. The model basically intended for roll control studies, is a completely non-linear model and has 104 degrees of freedom. ADAMS software has been used to determine the model behavior to specific steering inputs. The out- put of the simulation program was then used to train a neural net- work constructed to approximate the model for controller design and real-time studies of control action. Specific time-delayed feedback inputs to the neural network resulted an efficient approximate model with good accuracy for control tasks. 2001-01-3325.

Two different aluminum alloy materials have been used to pro- duce ventilated brake discs, on one hand, AS17G0.6 hypereutectic alloy and on the other hand, AS7G0.6 reinforced with 20% in wt. of SiC particles. The casting production technique used has been Low Pressure Casting (LPC) and some of the brake discs have been heat treated using a T6 treatment. Once the ventilated brake discs were produced and machined, they were tested in a dynamometer in order to compare the performance under service conditions of the aluminum alloy and grey cast iron (GCI) discs currently used in the market. 2001-01-3328. (P-370) Transverse interference pattern for the examination of spliced optical fibers (in transmission and at reflection). H. El-Ghandoor and G. M. Behery, Girls College; Ibraheem Nasser and A. Al-Shukri, King Fahd University of Petro- leum and Minerals; and M. Abd-El Rahman, Teacher College. The transverse interference pattern from a fusion-spliced optical fiber is obtained by illuminating the fiber with a laser sheet of light. The buckling on the fiber material in one direction of the spliced point is clear inside the transverse interference pattern. The buckling height ranges from 1 to 10 microns in a waveguide of a 50-micron core and 125-micron clad diameters. The refractive index profile inside the fiber core is calculated using a new method showing the change in the refractive index due to fusion splicing of the fiber. The refractive index profile is calculated by means of the transverse interference patterns obtained at different illumination directions. A CCD camera is used to record the transverse interference pattern from the fusion- spliced optical fiber. In order to calculate the visibil- ity of the obtained fringe patterns and the deflection angle of light through the fiber (displaying the change in the refractive index) it is necessary to measure the fringe maximum and minimum intensi- ties using a special software package. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3329. (P-370) A new sealing material for automotive exhaust application. John Hoyes, Flexitallic. The concern of the public about environmental issues will ensure that the emissions from automotive engines continue to be the sub- ject of scrutiny. A factor likely to be of increasing interest in the future is the degree of seal achieved at the exhaust manifold. The current trend for exhaust sealing is to use a sheet metal gas- ket with surface stress raising corrugations to form sealing regions. Such gaskets sometimes have strategically located coatings of filled elastomer or of exfoliated graphite. In all cases there are limitations with these styles of gaskets. There is now a new form of sealing material that is available that has a structure similar to that of the very familiar exfoliated graphite but which, unlike graphite, does not oxidize and is therefore very appropriate for automotive exhaust applications. The new material is based upon two forms of exfoliated vermicu- lite. Vermiculite is a sheet silicate mineral closely related to mica that has all of the thermal and chemical resistance for which mica is noted. But, unlike mica, vermiculite is capable of exfoliation or separation of the individual, very thin, sheets, which combine to form the naturally occurring flakes of vermiculite. One of the exfoli- ated forms is the familiar thermally exfoliated vermiculite and the other is the chemically exfoliated form of vermiculite. 2001-01-3330. (P-374) Development trends in bus manufac- turing. Jürg Zehnder, Alesa Alusuisse Engineering Ltd. The vast majority of all buses built today are composed of a steel chassis containing the diesel engine, gearbox and the axles with a steel body attached to the chassis. One route of development is exploring the use of clean fuels and alternative engines. Among the clean fuels compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and methanol must be mentioned. Representatives of alternative engines are diesel-electric systems and fuel cells. Another route is light- weight design of the body. For more than 30 years some manufac- turers offer aluminum structures to be mounted on a steel chassis. In order to overcome the impact of the high cost of aluminum against steel, innovative assembly techniques have been introduced to shorten the assembly work. In a following step, so-called hybrid concepts have been introduced, where big surfaces such as floor and roof are made as one piece sandwich panels. In advantageous con- figurations such buses can be built without chassis except axle mod- ules. This means that the expensive components such as engine and gearbox can be brought to the bus at a very late stage of assembly and not at the beginning with the chassis. Finally, even more fiber- reinforced elements are brought into the bus body such as rollbars, end modules, etc. All these developments have cut the manufactur- ing hours for a bus in half, reducing simultaneously the mass of the bus by 10-20%. 401</page><page sequence="401">2001-01-3332-2001-01-3339 2001-01-3332.

(P-368) Analysis of the influence of a vehicle's driveline dynamic behavior regarding the performance percep- tion at low frequencies. R. Capitani and M. Delogu, Università di Firenze; and E. Pilo, Fiat Auto. The aim of this paper (which is the continuation of the work pres- ented at the IS ATA 2000 International Conference) is to analyze the low frequency driveline torsional vibrations in a vehicle. It is known from many studies and investigations, that the driveline torsional vibrations are mainly responsible of the driver's performance per- ception and the vehicle's driveability. So many manufacturers use the driveline' s response in order to provide their vehicles with char- acteristics that are specific for the vehicle's segment class and the market. In this regard the vibration's behavior has been investigated, studying some typical steady and transient vehicle maneuvers. As a diagnostic guideline for the design's concept development, a driveline simulation model in Matlab/Simulink environment has been implemented. Therefore the basic features has been created to improve a com- plete vehicle co-simulation, using a engine cycle code and a mechanical driveline model. The paper describes the utilized approach and gives same exam- ples of its application in design and diagnostic. The important results (steady and transient phenomena) have been compared with experimental data carried out on a small/ medium Fiat Auto vehicle. 2001-01-3334. (P-368) A numerical model to analyze the dynamic response of a vehicle to variations in torque transmit- ted by the drive-line. Francesco Petrone, Gabriele Fichera, and Michele Lacagnina, University of Catania. The dynamic transient response of a vehicle during rapid varia- tions in driving torque is strongly influenced by the drive-line. An accurate numerical analysis to evaluate the vehicle performance in maneuvers which mainly interest longitudinal dynamics - such as rapid variations of the throttle or traction efforts - requires the devel- opment of a model able to simulate the dynamic behavior of the drive-line with good accuracy. This paper presents a full model of a front-wheel-drive car. The model was developed by interfacing a multibody vehicle model in ADAMS code and a drive-line model in Simulink code. The output from the drive-line model, given by the driving torque applied to halfshafts, is passed as input to the mul- tibody model. The calculated torque depends on the halfshafts kine- matic parameters, which are the outputs of the multibody model. The results obtained from the simulation of several maneuvers of longitudinal dynamics are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3335.

The present study deals with a new gear noise diagnosis system for automobile transmission units with an artificial intelligence; i.e., the neural net. In order to use this system, first of all, the system must be trained with teacher signals. This training process includes iterative calculations, so that the convergence in the training process is a very important issue. In the present paper, conditions were determined for the convergence. Then, the judgement performance of the developed system was discussed. As a result, the system can realize over 70% performance of noise evaluation experts. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3337.

Vladimir Boutylin and Joseph Lepeshko, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus ; and Valentin Ivanov, Belarusian State Polytechnic Academy. The investigation is concerned with dependencies between a fric- tion coefficient of the tire with a road, p, and wheel slip, s. The analysis of p-s-dependencies is given in the paper. The con- ventional approach to their presentation contains some discordance with real physical processes. On the basis of the external friction theory it is possible to offer another concept of potential p-s-curves. The potential p-s-curve is a function of the deformative, adhesion and transverse components of tire grip, the absolute slip velocity and the road reaction. Over the interrelation character of the given com- ponents it is possible to evaluate a current road-operational situa- tion. In addition the recommendations for practical use of the potential p-s-dependencies for the Systems of Active Safety are given. 2001-01-3339. (P-372) Fatigue strength of a rim model with FEM using a new approximation technique. Kubilay Yay and I. Murat Ereke, Technical University of Istanbul. In this study, a domestic wheel rim model has been modeled using FEM in order to calculate its fatigue strength. In other words, a different approximation algorithm has been developed to obtain service life of the rim. The effects of dynamic and static loads on the rim have been calculated and included to the FEM analysis. As a new approximation technique, during the service life of a vehicle under dynamic loads arising from the road conditions as taking into account, load spectrum has been constituted. In the design spectrum that has been utilized in our calculations, instead of using straight good road conditions, other fifty percent of forces that have been corresponding lifetime of the vehicle, accepted as hundred percent of dynamic and static forces caused by bad road conditions acting on the rim. As a result of this study, the calculated results have been com- pared to the experimental data taken from literature review. It can be seen that this method that we used in our calculations can be used for this kind of fatigue analysis of vehicle components. 402</page><page sequence="402">2001-01-3340-2001-01-3345 2001-01-3340.

Power demands in automotive electrical systems have signifi- cantly increased for the last few years, and this trend will soon lead to the same solution decided in the late 50' s, when 12V had replaced 6V. But this new transition will need a global vehicle approach spe- cially in energy management techniques, which also takes into account transient phenomena. Today, the question is no more: 'Why 42V?' but 'When?' and 'How?'. Moreover, the answer to these questions is really specific to each car manufacturer. That is the reason why PSA automotive has decided, through a LEAR's partnership, to develop a complete methodology, including numerical simulation. This methodology must achieve to define the best-in-class electrical architecture of dif- ferent alternatives, once the final level of performance (in terms of equipment or functionality) has been estimated. Relevant results from this virtual analysis based^en the own spe- cific model of a dual voltage network are commented in this paper, covering aspects like energy balance, transients, fault analysis and safety. 2001-01-3341. (P-371) Simulation of energy conversion in advanced automotive vehicles. Zdzisław Juda , Krakow University of Technology. , ^ Propulsion systems for future aavancèd automotive vehicles have to be optimized for maximum fuel conversion efficiency. In such a case, hybrid electric propukipn system seems to be most use- ful, due to the following facts: ^ Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) has energy storage (secondary energy source) which allows decreasing required peak value of power from the prime mover, that is the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE); - energy boosting allows to decrease ICE's or Fuel Cells' (FC) size and mass considerably; - because of the limited range of ICE operation area, maximum fuel conversion efficiency can be achieved after optimization; emissions can be reduced - ICE never idles; - application of a direct electromechanical drive with the DC/AC commutator motor or the motorized and generatorized wheels (M&amp;GW) enables an advanced automotive vehicle to ride with regenerative braking. Continuous progress in the domain of energy storage develop- ment (e.g., storage battery (SB), different kinds of fuel cells, such as Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) or Solid-Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), flywheels) allows for significant automotive vehicle mass decrease and, as a consequence, for required propulsion energy sav- ing. Advanced concepts with the M&amp;GWs and X-By-Wire (XBW) mechatronical system lead to achievement of an automotive vehicle with no propeller shafts and/or axles, no rack &amp; pinion gears and no transmission gears. In this paper, the simulation methodology and mathematical modeling results of different kinds of energy con- version for advanced automotive vehicles are presented. Simulation models are oriented on the best compromise between energy conver- sion efficiency and minimum of emissions. Simulation tools and physical models presented in the paper are based on Matlab/ Simulink/Advisor software environment. 2001-01-3342. (P-371) Overall design methodology for power electronics converters. Moez Bensaied, Peugeot Citroën Automo- bile ; and Ludovic Jourdan , Jean-Luc Schanen, and James Roudet, Laboratoire Electrotechnique de Grenoble. The purpose of this paper is to present a new methodology to design power electronics equipments. The main idea is to take simultaneously into account all the physical phenomena involved in the converter design. This study is the result of a collaboration between PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN and the LEG (Laboratoire d'Electrotechnique de Grenoble). The difficulty of this work con- sists in evolving simple (easy) but fairly accurate analytical models for the different physical phenomena. This tool should permit to design a non-insulated Switched Mode Power Supply (S.M.P.S.) under several constraints (E.M.C, standards, losses, ...) with an over- all volume optimization. 2001-01-3343. (P-371) Modeling and simulation of vehicle electric power system. Myoungho Sunwoo, Wootaik Lee , and Daeho Choi , Hanyang Univ. Since many electric and electronic systems are continuously added in a vehicle to meet various regulations and customer demands over the last decade, the demand on the electric power have been substantially increased. Furthermore the idle time fraction during the vehicle traveling has been increased due to the heavy urban traffic condition. The electric power system of the modern vehicle has to supply enough electrical energy to numerous electri- cal and electronic systems. A detailed understanding of the characteristics of the electric power system, electrical load demands, and driving environment such as road, season, and vehicle weight are required when the capacities of generator and battery are determined for a vehicle. In order to avoid an over or under design problem of the electric power system, a simulation program for electric power estimation is ade- quate. In order to estimate precisely, it is necessary to develop rela- tively simple and accurate electrically equivalent models of major systems. In this study, vehicle electric power system, which is mainly composed of generator and battery, is modeled and evaluated. Among various proposed battery models, two types of battery model are compared in terms of accuracy and easy-of-use. Two models are distinguished by the consideration of in-rush current at the begin- ning of charging and discharging. As an alternator model, variable terminal voltage model is newly proposed, and also it is compared to constant terminal voltage model. Based on the major component model, a simulation algorithm is developed and used to perform a case study. Compared with the real data from the vehicle, the simu- lation results of energy generation and consumption are comparable. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3344.

Fernando Gallego and Jordi Bigorra , LEAR Automotive (EEDS); Marc Seguer and Francisco Javier Sánchez , SEAT; and Josep Samitier, Manei Puig , and Xavier Moneo , Universität de Barcelona. All the electrical-based systems and equipment of a vehicle depends, in last case, of a small but important device called battery. Understand and predict battery behavior is one old target of the automotive manufacturers for different reasons like safety, comfort, fuel economy, etc... The paper will show the working-line and tests results of Lear, Seat and UB to achieve a method for monitoring the state of health and state of charge of battery life. There are some dif- ficulties for in-vehicle battery monitoring: wide range of current levels, interference due to loads powered on, hard climatic condi- tions, high tolerances in battery manufacturing, among others. Some of the methods for battery monitoring evaluated so far have been: Coulomb counting, Impedance spectroscopy, PH mea- suring, etc... For low-cost on-line automotive applications the solu- tion that could provide better results is based on impedance spec- troscopy due to two main reasons: may be integrated into power management system of the vehicle, also optionally into the battery, and an historic profile is unnecessary for well running. First prototypes confirm initial expectations and after some studies carried out on different vehicles, such a spectrum analysis of power distribution bus, battery life cycle tests and temperature influence, shows the viability of system developed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3345. (P-373) Correlation between agricultural trac- tor's diesel engine on-road service load and regulations for exhaust emission testing. S. Jankovic , S. Balasubramanian, and C. Roy , TAFE. 403</page><page sequence="403">2001-01-3345-2001-01-3352 There is obvious a great difference between emission tests for the on-road and off-road vehicle's diesel engines. This fact is based on unparallel service load of engines installed on those vehicles. But it is true that agricultural tractors are frequently used for haulage and similar applications in regular on-road conditions. In those circum- stances their contribution to the total emission in the road environ- ment is unavoidable. Based on that, study presented in this paper strictly relates to agricultural tractor operation down the road. This is due to the fact that in rural areas, the tractors are used for towing trailers on the roads in approximately 50% of the total life cycle. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the relations between real service load of the diesel engines installed in the agri- cultural tractors during haulage and regulations that are in force for official exhaust emission testing. The paper presents results of a number of typical agricultural tractors' applications on the local roads, village roads, etc. Having in mind that exhaust emission tests are frequently improved it is of interest to compare achieved results with some existing tests and proposals for further improvement. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3347. (P-367) Integrating Monte Carlo simulation, momentum-based impact modeling, and restitution data to ana- lyze crash severity. Nathan A. Rose, Stephen J. Fenton, and Chris- topher M. Hughes, Knott Laboratory, Inc. Crash severity is quantified by the change in velocity experi- enced by a vehicle during an impact along with the time duration over which that change in velocity occurs. Since the values of the input parameters for calculating the change in velocity are not known exactly, there is uncertainty associated with the calculated change in velocity. Accurate evaluation of the crash severity will, therefore, include analysis of the effect that uncertainties in the val- ues of the input parameters have on the calculated change in veloc- ity. Monte Carlo simulation, a statistical technique, enables the reconstructionist to evaluate the effect of uncertainty on the analysis of crash severity. Use of the Monte Carlo simulation technique is beneficial since a reconstructionist can enter a range of values for each input param- eter. A probability distribution can be assigned to the range of val- ues, which indicates the likelihood that any value in that range corre- sponds to the actual value of the parameter. The simulation gener- ates thousands of possible combinations of the input parameters selected from the specified ranges, monitors the results of the com- binations and analyzes them statistically. Application of the Monte Carlo technique is intended to improve the legitimacy of crash severity analysis by helping the reconstructionist consider a wide range of possible solutions within the bounds of the imperfect data and report statistically meaningful ranges for the change in velocity. This paper demonstrates the application of the Monte Carlo tech- nique to impact severity analysis using a derived two-dimensional, rigid body, momentum-based impact model. Thorough guidance is given to aid the reconstructionist in integrating the momentum model with the Monte Carlo simulation technique and this method is illustrated with a case study. Since the impact model employs res- titution constraints in the normal and tangential directions, the effect of uncertainty in formulating appropriate ranges for the values of the restitution coefficients is discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3348. (P-367) Crash rates of younger drivers. Adam J. Kirk and Nikiforos Stamatiadis, University of Kentucky. Over the past decade crash rates of younger drivers have been increasing despite a decrease in their driver population. This study examined specific driving maneuvers whose unsuccessful undertak- ing results in specific types of crashes involving these drivers. Four types of crashes were identified including crashes at intersections, rear end, crashes resulting from passing maneuvers and single vehi- cle crashes. For all crashes a general trend of decreasing involve- ment with increasing age was observed indicating that inexperience is the largest single contributor to the increased crash rates of youn- ger drivers. Increasing the level of awareness among young drivers about these issues and their likely crash involvement seems to be the only viable approach. 2001-01-3349. (P-367) Effects of age and cohort on older driv- ers. Juan Villalba, Adam Kirk, and Nikiforos Stamatiadis, Univer- sity of Kentucky. The population of drivers over the age of 65 has been rapidly increasing since the early 1970' s and this trend is expected to con- tinue in the future. Aging could affect visual and cognitive abilities of elderly drivers and possibly impair their ability to operate a vehi- cle safely. This study examined the impact of this population on traf- fic safety over a 20-year period. The factors of age and cohort are examined to determine their influence on the crash involvement of elderly drivers. Age factors have been shown to be decisive in crashes resulting from complex situations, whereas cohort effects play a more dominate role in less demanding circumstances. 2001-01-3350. (P-367) Specification of older driver require- ments for technologies to enhance capability. Helen Middleton and Diane Westwood, University of Sunderland. Accident statistics show that drivers over the age of 55 and in particular those over the age of 70 are over represented in multi- vehicle accidents at junctions. Research indicates that this is the result of cognitive limitations. At the same time, social changes have made it increasingly disadvantageous not to have access to a car, and the expectations and requirement of future cohorts of elderly drivers to continue driving well into old age will be even greater than that of previous years. Therefore, it is increasingly important that inves- tigations are conducted to increase understanding of age-related cognitive abilities and driving performance, to enable issues regard- ing both road safety and mobility of older drivers to be addressed. The aim of this study is to improve our understanding of age- related driving performance by developing a model of cognition in complex road situations, for the aging driver. The study takes a dynamic approach in which participants are assessed using tests of cognitive function in context during simulated driving. Research outcomes will inform automotive design tools for new assistive technologies. This should encourage safer driving and sustained mobility for older drivers. 2001-01-3351. (P-371) Route optimization for intelligent transport system using genetic algorithms. Francisco J. Diaz Pernas and José Fernando Diez Higuera, University of Valladolid ; and Freddy J. Perozo Rondon, University of Carabobo. In this work we show a method to obtain optimized routes using genetic algorithms techniques; in short, we have used Evolutionary Programming. Our main goal is to implement a method to obtain the best possible route between two points on a real road map, which will be included, as optimization module, in a fleet management sys- tem. The first approach to solve this problem is, basically, to solve the shortest path problem (SPP) between two points. Nevertheless, to obtain an optimized route in a road network is a more complicated problem. It is necessary to keep in mind more restrictions when choosing the best route to deliver the merchandise. The result of our proposal is the implementation of a method based on evolutionary computation techniques. The developed method offers some advantages over mathematical algorithms that solve more complex problem than the SPP, as it takes less memory resources, and also, it presents more flexibility to changes in the restrictions applied to the road segments. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3352.

(P-371) SeaTTronics: An integrated smart seat. Antoni Ferré , J ordì Bigorra , Jordi Mestre , and Fernando Gal- lego LEAR Automotive (EEDS) Spain. SeaTTronics is a new automotive seat system including different mechatronic units connected by bus controlling the seat position, seat movement, seat heating and new devices like ventilation, and massage among others. SeaTTronics is based on a distributed control approach: one switch mechatronic module (gateway) connecting the seat to the rest of the car through CAN bus and mechatronic 4 smart nodes 'with the actuator for each motor or other actuators interfaced through LIN- bus. This distributed architecture based on LIN-bus allows the whole system to be more flexible and modular.

A process which was pioneered in the 90s, laser welding of tai- lored (or engineered) blanks has now become a well established pro- cess within the automotive industry. Tailored blank welding suppli- ers have had to ramp up production in a relatively short space of time to match the growth in this market - with many lessons learned along the way.

Laser beam sources at different wavelengths are applied, e.g., highly efficient diode laser systems and diode pumped Nd:YAG-laser operating in quasi-continuous wave mode. Welding velocities up to several m/min can be reached, dependent on material composition, absorption characteristic, thick- ness and average laser output power. Furthermore, capabilities of a thermographic system for material's qualification related to their weldability will be presented by investigations of different plastic components. Experimental results for thermographic process con- trol during the welding process are presented as well. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3358.

Joly, RENAULT. This work present lap welding of zinc-coated sheets and leads to the realization of an industrial process. The difficulty comes from the fact that the zinc boiling point (1180K) is lower than the steel melting point (1800K) leading to violent boiling of zinc in steel. We choose a two-spots process: first one concerns the zinc- coating vaporization; second one allows welding. Previously, we develop a numerical modeling that permits a pro- cess parameters choice and limits the plan of experimentations. Scanning speed, laser power, size and shape of the two spots were optimized. Our numerical software leads to the choice of a zinc vaporization elliptic spotlight. Experimentations confirm the predicted tendency. 2001-01-3359. (P-370) Development of 980N/mm2 class ultra high strength steel suitable for mechanical joining. Kohei Hase- gawa, Toshiaki U rabe, Akihide Yoshitake, and Yoshihiro Hosoya, NKK Corp. Suitability of ultra-high-strength steels (UHSS) for mechanical joining was investigated. When mechanical joining was applied to conventional 980N/mm2-class UHSSs having dual phase micro- structure (ferrite and martensite), surface cracking occurred. Addi- tionally cleaving inside mechanical joints was also observed in cases involving joining of dual phase steel by tools with larger clearance than designed. This cleaving causes a serious decrease in joint strength. Resistance to surface cracking and inside cleaving depends on the metallurgical structure of UHSS. Single martensite phase is superior for preventing the occurrence of defects in mechanical join- ing. This is because of its excellent local formability, which can be evaluated by the hole-expanding test using a machined hole speci- men. Besides superior resistance to cracking and inside cleaving, single martensite phase steel exhibited higher mechanical joint strength than dual phase steel in cross tensile test. The strength of mechanical joints depends on the inner shape of joints, which is influenced by mechanical properties of the joined material. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3361.

A high carbon, high silicon and high manganese steel containing about 1% carbon, 3.0% silicon and 2.0% manganese has been devel- oped. This steel has been synthesized using the concepts from Austempered Ductile Cast Iron (ADI) technology. The influence of austempering process on the microstructure and the room tempera- ture mechanical properties of this steel was investigated. The influ- ence of microstructure on the plain strain fracture toughness of this new steel was also examined. Four batches of compact tension and cylindrical tensile samples were prepared from this steel as per ASTM standards E-399 and E-8, respectively. Two batches of speci- mens were processed by traditional quenching and tempering pro- cess while other two batches were austempered. The microstructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction and optical metallography. The test results indicate that the austempering process has resulted in a significant improvement in mechanical properties as well as the fracture toughness of the material. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3362.

(P-369) A role-playing paradigm for teaching Six Sigma QC. Ali E. Kashef University of Northern Iowa; and Marc A . Timmerman, University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Six Sigma is a popular methodology for implementing industrial quality control. Six Sigma seeks to provide a virtually zero product defect rate. Six Sigma combines elements of traditional statistical analysis methods with novel communication and management struc- tures. Industrial training in the Six Sigma strategy has been ham- pered by the difficulty of presenting these core concepts in commu- nications and management structures in the context of traditional lecture-workbook training schemes. This paper describes a curricu- lum based on role-playing exercises that seeks to provide a vivid, interactive learning experience for industrial trainees learning the Six Sigma process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3364.

Petra Win- zer , Universität Gesamthochschule Wuppertal; and Joaquin Sitte , Queensland University of Technology. Enterprises thrive to the extent they can meet the demands of their stakeholders. The authors proposed the Comprehensive Qual- ity Function as a measure for the degree of satisfaction of demands. However demands on enterprises are rarely clearly stated. Therefore the first step towards quantitative strategic management is assem- bling a catalogue of stakeholder demands. In a case study on an car manufacturing enterprise, we demonstrate the feasibility of that undertaking and that even a partial list of demands can immediately be applied to improving enterprise quality, environmental and safety auditing procedure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3365. (P-369) Quality, QFD and control charts: A managerial assessment during the product development and production process. F. Gaietto , Politecnico di Torino. Quality Engineering looks at designing Quality into every prod- uct and all the processes. Design is surely the most important phase for Quality both of products and processes. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Taguchi Methods were both originated in Japan and is claimed as very important for Quality design. They are usually considered synergical for the development of products and processes. Are they good? Productivity improves as the quality of the process moves upwards. The Japanese learned in 1950 that this can be achieved if the process is in control. Economic manufacturing requires quality control and improvement and, consequently, the use of 'Quality tools' such as Statistical Process Control, Control Charts, and DOE. The paper will show that an incompetent approach to Quality, and to Quality Methods, can do more harm than good. 2001-01-3366. (P-369) Producing high quality parts in manu- facturing processes in spite of reducing the costs. Peter Wack , University of Applied Science. For the automotive and transportation technology it is important to produce parts of a high quality level. If a produced and assembled part will be damaged or out of order under guarantee the customer has to bring the whole object to a service station. At first the reason of error has to be found and secondly the product has to be repaired or replaced. The procedure takes time and it is not good for the repu- tation of the producer. Another point are the avoidable costs in this case. 2001-01-3367. (P-368) A New TEHD approach for sophisti- cated simulation of journal bearings. Franz 7. Maassen, FEV Motorentechnik GmbH; and Stefan Thomas , RWTH Aachen. The new Thermo-Elasto-Hydro-Dynamic (TEHD) code devel- oped by FEV, is designed to improve the predictability of journal bearing designs and thereby increase the reliability of safety factors in the development of highly loaded internal combustion engines. Advanced analysis tools are evaluated by their performance as well as by their ease of use. High performance means on the one hand: taking into account all the important characteristics, like bear- ing elasticity or cavitation effects, to mention only some major parameters for modern journal bearing analysis. On the other hand: an economic run-time behavior must be a key feature concerning usability of the TEHD-demands for daily development praxis. Ease of use means also, that the TEHD model can easily be used as a plug-in routine of an already existing software package that is well known to the development departments. For this reason, FEV developed a new transient TEHD bearing model which is linkable to established commercial Multi-Body- System (MBS) software packages, like ADAMS®. In principle, this new TEHD model could also be linked to any MBS program, although the connection has only been verified with ADAMS®, so far. Starting with an introduction to the major basics of the software interaction organization and the actual TEHD bearing model, the paper presents further details of this new analytical tool. A new modal approach for the bearing's stiffness representation will be shown, leading to a very time-efficient algorithm for sophisticated bearing analyses. Concluding, exemplary results of journal bearing simulations by means of Fee's TEHD code will be presented. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3368. (P-368) Simulation of the piston and piston ring dynamic. Frank Georg Haubner , FEV Motorentechnik. All reciprocating engines from the first diesel engine to turbo- charged Formula 1 engines require a sealing of the combustion chamber. This sealing is realized by the compression rings. Today a set of two compression rings and one oil control ring is standard, the large variety of available solution demonstrate the continuous effort and attention paid to an optimized system performance since the first engine was started. The complexity of the interactions with the mechanical, thermal, thermodynamic, tribologie, dynamic behavior of the piston still requires mechanical testing of the various components before release to series production. This procedure can be shortened by use of simulation models reflecting the real behavior in detail to select the most promising combinations of components and characteristics. This paper presents the model to simulate the dynamic motion of the piston as function of the liner and piston geometry, the surface quality and the thermal and thermodynamic boundaries. The pri- mary and secondary motion of the piston is used further as boundary to simulate the dynamic behavior of the piston rings. Again the sur- face of the tribologie partners is considered based on a statistical approach. The dynamic behavior is used to predict the wear rates and the blow by. Based on the simulation model of a modern combustion engine, the dynamic behavior for various operating conditions will be pres- ented and described. This section is followed by the comparison to measurement results. Finally an outlook will be made for the further development of the piston group in modern combustion engines with respect to increasing engine performance, reduced fuel consumption and low emissions levels. 2001-01-3370.

(P-368) Mechanics and stress analysis of piston ring in multibody single-cylinder internal combustion engine - Fe analysis. Shivakant N. Kurbet and R. Krishna Kumar , Indian Institute of Technology Madras. This paper presents the results of the simulation of a piston ring in a multibody single-cylinder internal combustion engine using explicit Finite Element analysis. The Finite Element model com- prises of an assembly of piston, top compression ring, liner, con- necting rod and crankshaft. The ring geometry, its coating and coat- ing methods, its mechanical and its thermal properties are factors which influence engine performance. Deformation in the ring, the stresses developed therein and ring-liner clearance have been deter- mined. This approach to engine design reduces the conceptual design-to-development cycle time and reduces the need of extensive engine testing for evaluating ring performance. The information obtained from the analysis serves as input for ring design and for development of coating techniques. 2001-01-3372. (P-368) Prediction of pressure fluctuation in the inlet and exhaust system of engine using a real gas model. S. C. Low and Min Feng , MSAE. In the solutions of governing equations of one-dimensional unsteady compressible flow, the fluid is usually assumed to be ideal gas. However, when the fluid cannot be regarded as ideal gas, such as gases of higher molecular weight and simple gas at extreme tem- perature and pressure, the assumption may cause significant error in the calculation. Hence, efforts are devoted to finding new approaches to deal with the compressible unsteady flow without the ideal gas limitation. This research work introduces a real gas prop- erty table to work in conjunction with the three governing partial differential equations for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The results from the calculation using carbon dioxide gas are encouraging. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3373. (P-370) Development of high-strength carbo- nitriding process.

One of the problems concerning T/M is conventionally how 'Improving the input torque as the engine gets higher power' and 'Making product lighter in weight and more compact to improve the fuel consumption' can be realized at the same time. To realize these things at the same time, it is needless to say that the gears must be stronger. For the 'pitting fatigue strength' which is quoted as a prob- lem lately, the fatigue mechanism has not been clarified, yet. There- fore, it is now a big problem how to achieve high strength. In the meantime, we tried to develop the production engineering for 'finer crystal grains' and 'fine-dispersion precipitation of carbo-nitrides, 'and succeeded in improving 'pitting fatigue strength 'remarkably. 2001-01-3374.

The service life of engine crankshaft is closely related to its mate- rial characteristics. Without any dimensional modification, one can significantly improve the fatigue life of crankshaft by applying vari- ous surface treatments. The objective of this research is to predict and to quantify the fatigue life of crankshaft at different alloy design and surface treatments - microalloyed steel versus carbon steel as well as nitriding versus fillet rolling. It is found that nitriding improves more than 60% in fatigue life depends upon matrix hard- ness. This study also demonstrates a relationship between fatigue life and fillet rolling force. We observed that the fillet rolled speci- mens with the applied force of 500-900 kgf exhibit 40-80% improvement in fatigue life compared to non-treated sample. Conse- quently, methods are proposed to quantify and normalize fatigue life at various treatments to optimize crankshaft design for maximizing the engine performance. 2001-01-3376. (P-370) The influence of a local heat treatment on the drawing properties of an aluminum alloy. M. Beckmann and F. Vollertsen, University of Paderborn. By forming complex components a combination of deep drawing and stretch drawing is incidental. To investigate the possibilities of local heat treatment on a stretch drawing process an experimental setup for the stretch drawing of a cylindrical cup using an elastomer membrane was made. The local heat treatment of the aluminum alloy AA 6016 T4 was conducted by an electrical heated copper punch. The results of experimental investigations were confirmed in FE-calculations, which show an increase of the stretch drawing depth and a change in the anisotropic behavior of the material due to the heat treatment. 2001-01-3378. (P-370) The influence of Ti additions on the microstructure of 2090 alloys used in aeronautical construc- tions. Marius Vasilescu, Ioana Vasilescu, and Catalin Sfat, Univer- sity "Politehnica ' of Bucharest. The aluminum alloys with lithium content of 2090 type represent metallic materials of high technical interest, with radical perspec- tives in the aeronautical and spatial industries and in other technical domains. These interest are due first of all to the special characteris- tics of reduced specific masses and of mechanical resistance obtained through alloying with Cu and Mg, and through complex heat treatments. The impurities and microadditions of alloying for the Al-Li sys- tem have a great influence on the structure and properties of these alloys and they determine decisively the hardening heat treatments results. The present paper includes studies and experimental researches of optical and electronic microscopy regarding some aluminum- lithium base alloys of 2090 type supplementary alloyed with Ti for the finishing of the structure and improve the properties of these alloys which are used in aeronautical constructions. The adding of 0.5% Ti on the 2090 alloy lead to a finishing of the grains of ocai solid solution from 17-50 pm to 10-40 jam and the polyhedralisation of these grains. The structure analysis present dis- tinctive phases of ALC^Mgô and TiAL type of lens shape disposed at the grain limits and in conglomeration with copper and nickel, and inside the grain phase of ALZr and Mg2Si type. Through X-ray diffraction analysis was observed that the addi- tion of 0.5% Ti in the 2090 alloy lead to the apparition of star or polyhedral phase. The star phase of AI3LÌ type, metastable, coherent with matrix crystallize in cubic system. 2001-01-3379. (P-370) Engineered surfaces for the transport industries. P. F. Stratton, BOC Gases; and K. Bennett, KMB Metal- lurgical. Low-temperature surface treatments lie between carbonitriding and nitriding in terms of both process temperature and composition of the resultant surface layers. They all produce a compound surface layer that is scuff and corrosion resistant, supported by a carbon/ nitrogen diffusion zone that improves wear and fatigue life. They tend to be grouped under the general term nitrocarburizing but in reality they can vary considerably in the properties induced and in their areas of application. The diverse surface properties produced find applications throughout the transport industry and elsewhere. 407</page><page sequence="407">2001-01-3380-2001-01-3387 2001-01-3380. (P-367) Analysis of driving simulators and their effects on the users definition of a method to evaluate the onset of motion sickness in the users of driving simulators. Sonia Val , Mario Maza , and Santiago Baselga , University of Zaragoza. Driving simulators are a powerful tool that however present some intrinsic limitations that should be taken into account to draw the right conclusions from their use. In a simulator, several parame- ter tunings can be done, allowing us to study the effects of motion on the subjects seated in them. The research is based on two types of simulator architectures: the first one is the classical 6-dof Stewart platform; the second one is a spherical 4-dof platform. The study follows two main guidelines: the implementation of a simulation logic able to imitate typical motion maneuvers that a land vehicle follows in driving performance; using this simulation logic some tests on different subjects will be carried out, in order to analyze human performance and the effects of the motion simulator. Special attention should be paid to motion sickness phenomena. These results are considered as fundamental to establish some rules for the use of driving simulators in human factors and biomechanical research. 2001-01-3381. (P-367) TRAINER project: Development of an improved learning method for training novice drivers with sim- ulators. J. Dois and J. Pardo , Polytechnic University of Valencia; W. Verwey, University of Dortmund; and D. De Waard, University of Groningen. Novice drivers frequently tend to overestimate their driving skill as compared with experienced drivers. Furthermore, they are not so familiar with the actual dynamics of their vehicle, which effects, for example, the point at which they think they can still stop for an object. Traditionally, driver training has focused on vehicle control skills and traffic rule knowledge without efforts to improve higher order skills. These higher order skills are included in driver training in many countries but rather in a theoretical way, included in text- books, and is not covered in practical training. The reason is that this problem cannot be systematically handled in practical training, as on roads risky situations are scarce and usually avoided. Hence, realistic, interactive, off-road tools are required. This paper focuses on the development of TRAINER tools (multimedia interactive soft- ware and simulators) that will be integrated into a common Euro- pean driver education and assessment methodology. Goal is to con- tribute to solving the serious problem of novice drivers and their safe integration into the traffic environment, thus promoting the 'Road Safety in the EU' policy of EU, as well as the policy towards 'Common driver training and licensing procedures in the EU. 'Finally, driver training and assessment have not followed the rapid evolution of in-vehicle passive and active safety systems and tele- matic aids. Hence, drivers today are using or are about to use equip- ment for which they have not been trained. From the above it is clear that there is a pressing need for a new pan-European driver training methodology, which will focus more on the enhancement of higher order skills of novice drivers, including the use of new telematic aids. This will be achieved through the development of interactive multimedia software and low and mean-cost simulators within the TRAINER project. 2001-01-3382. (P-371) Control of mixture composition using cylinder pressure sensors. Norbert Müller and Rolf Isermann , Darmstadt University of Technology. Cylinder pressure signals contain valuable information for closed loop engine control. For using this information low-cost cylinder pressure sensors with high long-term stability have been developed and are starting to be installed into production engines. This paper presents new algorithms to estimate cylinder air mass, to control exhaust gas recirculation and to estimate the air-fuel ratio distribution between different cylinders of a SI engine. The pro- posed control algorithms avoid additional calibration expense by using adaptive, model-based control strategies and learning feed- forward control. They have been implemented on a dSPACE rapid control prototyping system and have been evaluated through studies using a 1 .0-liter 3-cylinder SI engine on a dynamic engine test stand. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3383. (P-371) In-car modeling of emissions with dynamic artificial neural networks. R. Hentschel, R.-M. Cernat , and J.-U. Varchmin , Technical University of Braunschweig. Since the introduction of ECU's (Electronic Control Units) in the 1980's, the complexity of modern engine control has increased rap- idly. The adaptation to newly developed diesel engines and newly composed powertrains is a long and difficult procedure. Every pos- sible application is a balance between economical fuel consumption and the conflicting performance of emitted nitrogen oxides and par- ticles. New software tools to support the difficult ECU application process are required to fulfill the limited emissions required by leg- islation. The paper describes the development of a digital measure- ment data processing system for in-car use. The ECU maps can be changed during the driving cycles. With the information obtained, a Dynamic Artificial Neural Network is trained and modeling of the vehicle emissions becomes possible. 2001-01-3384.

Iulian Raducanu , Medical and Pharmaceutical University Gr. T. Popa lasi ; Dragos Ar otar ite i, Aalborg University Esbjerg; and Laurentiu Dimitriu, Technical University of lasi. This paper presents a new control strategy for the ignition advances and for the fuel injected per cycle for a thermal engine with internal combustion and spark ignition. The main features of this approach consist of the controller robustness and of the capabil- ity of processing vague information given by the use of fuzzy infer- ence in order to generate the control variables. 2001-01-3386. (P-373) Performance and emissions character- istics of a naturally aspirated diesel engine with esterified vege- table oil. P. K. Bose , R. A. Beg , B. B. GhosĶ R. K. Chakrabarti , and Subodh Kr. Saha, Jadavpur Univ. Vegetable oil as a biomass-based energy, can be considered as possible alternative fuel. Neat Vegetable oil is too viscous, has poor volatility, comparatively low cetane number and having different chemical structures than diesel fuel. In DI diesel engine, these fuels cannot be used without further processing. Modified or vegetable oils processed by esterification can mitigate these problems and become more suitable for diesel engine application. The present experimental study reports the performance and exhaust emissions of a DI diesel engine by using methyl esters karanji oil and heated karanji oil in comparison to 100% diesel operation. The influence of injection pressures and injection timings have also been reported. The data brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal effi- ciency generated using esterified karanji oil and diesel are compara- ble. The maximum variation of the emission CO for esterified karanji oil is about 35% higher than that of diesel. Though CO emis- sion is on the higher side, but considering good engine performance and economy, in the rural area (less polluted) having abundant avail- ability of karanji oil, which can be a very good substitute for diesel to run diesel engines as prime mover for irrigation purposes. 2001-01-3387. (P-373) Type effect of fuel properties on unburned HC and particulate matter emissions in a small DI diesel engine. Hideyuki Tsunemoto and Hiromi Ishitani, Kitami Institute of Technology; and Tatsuhito Kaimai, BOSCH Automotive Systems Corp. Fuel properties are a very important factor to reduce particulate matter (PM) and other emissions with diesel engines. Especially the effect of aromatic contents has been discussed, though details of the influence differ in different reports. In this study the mechanism of PM formation was investigated in a small direct injection diesel engine. The fuels tested were paraffinic hydrocarbons (C7-C12 ) 408</page><page sequence="408">2001-01-3387-2001-01-3398 with different boiling points (98-2 16°C), and the blending of aro- matic hydrocarbons (1-4 rings) with paraffinic and olefínic hydro- carbons. The effect of the structure of fuels with the same carbon numbers (dodecane and dodecene) was also investigated. The results showed that the amount of SOF decreases to about one-tenth of that of diesel oil when using low boiling point paraffinic hydro- carbons like heptane. However, the total amount of unburned hydro- carbon increases due to over-leaning of the mixture due to the early evaporation. Even when carbon numbers are the same, dodecene with a double bond olefinic structure and blended with aromatic hydrocarbons result in higher SOF than dodecane with its ordinary paraffinic structure. Blending of aromatic hydrocarbons with dodec- ane causes increases in dry soot emissions while SOF emissions are almost unchanged. 2001-01-3388. (P-373) The effect of rape oil-diesel oil mixture composition on particulate matter emission level in diesel engine. Wincenty Lotko , Technical University of Radom; Rafal Longwic, Technical University of Lublin; and Marek Swat , Technol- ogy Institute-Radom. Vegetable oils are very attractive as alternative fuels in view of closed carbon circulation in atmosphere and what follows the restriction of the greenhouse effect. Rape oil is one of plant derived fuels which use as a diesel fuel is thoroughly studied in many coun- tries (Germany, Austria, France). The results of research in which particulate matter emission was measured in the 13-Mode Test Pro- cedure, for rape oil-diesel oil mixtures with 10%, 15%, 20%, 30% and 40% rape oil contents, and comparatively for diesel oil, have been presented in the paper.

Rainer Neumann and Vladimir Kubena, Visteon Corp . Europe. The paper deals with the current progress in rear lighting technol- ogy. Within the competition in offering the best vehicle for the indi- vidual customer safety aspects but also the appearance of the rear lights are getting more and more important. Our investigation is based on the equipment of LEDs within rear lamps. In combination with the CHMSLs (Center High Mounted Stop Lights) the styling but also the safety feature which one can realize is different. In achieving shorter reaction times when using LEDs there were already made some general experiments in a laboratory. For the first time we did experimental analysis of reaction times of stop function of rear lamps including CHMSLs in various combinations in real traffic conditions, taking conventional tungsten halogen bulbs and LEDs as a light source. The results will be presented in this paper. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3392.

The development of headlamps was found to experience a dynamic process. For more than 50 years the tungsten double fila- ment bulbs (Bilux) had been dominating the lighting technology, followed in the seventies by the H4 bulb. Since the middle of the eighties the modern filament bulbs as H7 (now H9, HI 1) have been available. The Xenon gas discharge (or HID-) technology reached the auto- motive market in the nineties. Now the development is heading towards the new technology step.

Gediga, Product Engineering GmbH. This paper will present the modeling of electronic products with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), especially for appliances in cars. The so-called Generic Module-based LCA enables the user to model nearly every electronic product, each relating to their respective manufacturing phases. A short introduction to the method will be underlined by several examples. From the cooperation with industry partners outcomes of multi-client studies will be shown. The LCA results of electronic car appliances (combined sensors and actuators) take into consideration the manufacturing phase, the use phase according to interactions between the electronic systems and the car's use phase and finally the assessment of an End of Life (EoL) alternative for the appliance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3396. (P-371) Using patterns to integrate views in open automotive systems. Johannes Lauber and Christian Tischer, Robert Bosch GmbH. Automotive product lines promote reuse of software artifacts such as architectures, designs and implementations. System archi- tectures, and especially software architectures, are difficult to create due to the need to support variations. Traditional approaches empha- size the identification and description of generic components, which makes it difficult to support variations among products. The paper proposes an approach for transforming a software architecture to product design through using patterns in a four-way refinement and evolution process. The paper investigates how patterns may be used to verify the conceptual integrity in the view integration procedure to support software sharing in an open automotive system. 2001-01-3397. (P-371) Low-cost neural network hardware for control. Joaquin Sitte , Queensland University of Technology. Feedforward artificial neural networks are universal function approximators and inherently parallel computing structures. Because of the lack of appropriate hardware realizations, applica- tions of neural networks are predominantly implemented as sequen- tial programs on digital processors. In this paper, we describe an analogue integrated circuit realization of a local response neural net- work (LCNN) that achieves a high degree of parallel computation in a small size, low cost and low power consumption. Because it can directly receive analog inputs from sensors and output analog con- trol signals to actuators it is well suited as a building block for real- time control systems. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3398. (P-369) New advances in plastics joining for high-speed production. Gareth McGrath, I. A. Jones , P. A. Hilton , E. J. C. Kellar, and A. Taylor , TWI Ltd.; and P. Sallavanti , Gentex. The vast majority of automobile components contain joints, typi- cally: 3,000 spot welds 2 meters of welds (arc or laser) 20 friction and MIAB Welds 150 welded plastics components 500 mechanical fasteners 10,000 electrical connections 8 Kg adhesives /sealants Thus, for virtually all commercial products, especially those pro- duced from more than one component, joints are a fact of life. Join- ing technology therefore is crucial within the manufacturing world. Although many traditional joining methods can be, and are applied successfully, the opportunity to innovate still exists. Indeed the innovative approach can have significant economic benefits associ- ated with reduced manufacturing costs, increased product quality and a greater freedom in material selection to design and manufac- ture new products. An ability to use high productivity and integrity joining at com- petitive rates is fundamental to the evolution in the automobile sec- tor. There is no real choice regarding the adoption of new technol- ogy: it is a pre-condition for survival. 409</page><page sequence="409">2001-01-3398-2001-01-3412 Recently, TWI has been active in the innovation of three dis- tinctly different joining technologies - adhesive bonding, plastics welding and protective coatings.

(P-369) Joining technologies to realize dissimi- lar joints for automotive applications. Nuri Akdut , Julian Ruiz Corostola, Ali Ihsan Koruk, and Laurent Cretteur, OCAS N. V.; and Ines Maronna , OCAS GmbH. During the last decades one of the main challenge in the automo- tive field has been weight reduction to satisfy the EU's demands concerning fuel consumption and environmental aspects. Conse- quently, various materials are being considered. Using different materials for different automotive parts requires advanced joining techniques. The present work deals with the most frequently used joining technique, namely resistance spot welding. Additionally, laser welding is being considered, since it is obvious that this tech- nique is being used for more and more parts. Since the welds of the dissimilar joints have to fulfill demands concerning formability, corrosion resistance and fatigue, the overall goal of this investigation is to find the best welding or joining parameters to achieve optimal joint performance in terms of struc- tural integrity and part requirement. The steel grades involved in creating dissimilar joints are two austenitic stainless steel grades (EN 1.4301 (304) and EN 1.4318 (301LN)) and three ferritic non-stainless grades (ZStE340, DP600 and St 14) with various thicknesses. The corresponding laser and spot welding parameters, microstructures, hardness mappings and mechanical properties were recorded. In laser as well as in spot welding the weld or nugget became fully martensitic. Correspond- ingly, the hardness clearly increased. The influence of the welding speed for laser welding and the welding current and post welding heat treatment (PWHT) during spot welding was investigated. 2001-01-3400.

Ryota Kurihara, Noriyuki Kakita, Hiroshi Shigeno, and Yutaka Matsushita , Keio Univ.; Ryotaro Fukui, Oki Electric Industry Co., Ltd; and Tomoyuki Yashiro, Chiba Institute of Technology. ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) is widely studied to solve traffic problem fundamentally. One of the communication systems on ITS, DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) is being standardized. Spot communication using radio beacons, which is already put into operation, isn't available to such applications as "Support for Safe Driving, 'thus it's needed to compose continuous and reliable communication zones. It is considered that the cost of infrastructure will increase if in every communication zone a com- munication facility is constructed. In this paper, we propose the scheme to install the roadside antenna (beacons) according to the attachment standard of road lightning. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3404.

Mary Gotzinger, S. Kalyanasundaram, and M. Cardew-Hall, The Australian National Univ.; and P. Hodgson, Deakin Univ. The springback of simple geometries can be predicted through theoretical analysis, however problems arise when transferring this analysis to the manufacturing environment. To determine why this is the case, a study of small curvature free bending through theoreti- cal analysis, manufacturing data and Finite Element (FE) simulation was completed. The theoretical analysis provided an understanding of the behav- ior of springback and gave accurate predictions in a controlled envi- ronment. The manufacturing and Finite Element data verified the trends predicted by theory, but lacked in accuracy. The paper concludes by proposing a prediction method based solely on the geometry that is well defined in both environments. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3412.

Within motor and vehicle industry, there is a permanent trend to improve existing materials in respect of their properties and eco- nomic fabrication, or to replace the same by new materials that meet adequate requirements to a greater extent than the existing ones. One 410</page><page sequence="410">2001-01-3412-2001-01-3421 of such materials that is gaining wide usage is nodular iron which belongs to a group of available low cost materials. As a structural material it is highly competitive with other structural materials, steel in particular. Nowadays nodular iron is used for making vital machine and engine components such as, for example, crankshafts, camshafts, gears. The paper offers results obtained in the process of testing high- speed diesel engine nodular iron crankshaft fatigue strength. To get a complete assessment of fatigue strength experimental test results and their proper use, scatter of such test results has been considered separately. Actually the scatter of test results represents one of the greatest problems in experimental tests. By introducing and analyz- ing the destruction probability the authors got the sound basis for determination of engine crankshaft safety and reliability. Thus the dilemma of how to use results obtained by testing fatigue strength of not-nitrided and nitrided nodular iron crankshafts is eliminated. The destruction probability both in the zone of limited durability and endurance limit has been analyzed by means of Weibull distribution. Also the paper offers analysis of factors that affect nodular iron N1.80 crankshaft endurance. It has been found out that the porosity, slag, flake graphite and carbides in structure represent the most influential factors affecting the nodular iron crankshaft endurance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3413.

This paper reports part of the results of a three-year project in collaboration with companies in the automotive and aerospace industry, aiming to develop new methodologies for Computer- Aided Assembly Process Planning (CAAPP). The aims of this proj- ect were to investigate, study the feasibility of integrating CAAPP with data management tools via a product model and review existing systems and methodologies. The project then became focused on finding solutions to some of the limiting factors that have kept CAAPP an immature technology for many years. This objective is satisfied by the integration of CAAPP functionality with a Product Data Management (PDM) tool, providing a data control framework and a high-level data structure to form the basis of planning.

(P-369) Application of rapid tooling for sheet metal forming: Flexible drawing die with punches built by SLS technique and by copying process. A. Gatto , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia; and L. Iuliano, Polytechnic of Torino. The Rapid Prototyping (RP) process is evolving beyond just making three-dimensional models and it is beginning to have an impact on tool construction. The sheet metal forming industries are reluctant to implement the Rapid Tooling (RT) process until the costs and time effectiveness have been proved: resulting cost cuts over conventional methods can be significant but justifying the nec- essary equipment can be difficult. One reason is that benefits of RP are not always easy to quantify; another is that the financial staff may not understand the need for a new technology that can radically change the way a company produces prototypes. An AISI 304 benchmark was selected. Usually it is produced in three steps: draw- ing; trimming and bending. The combination of prototype drawing dies and laser cutting instead of trimming can answer many ques- tions regarding the development of metal sheet components. This paper regards the evaluation of the possibility to turn out a small batch or sampling production of sheet metal formed by means of flexible drawing die whit punch built using Selective Laser Sinter- ing (SLS) and with one built by copying process applied to a origi- nal part produced by stereolithography (SLA). The results show that both these solutions may be successfully used even if the punch built by SLS technique guaranties higher volume production and parts quality. 2001-01-3417. (P-369) New development of thermomechani- cal processing (TMP) and high volume production aluminum wheel suspension arms. Hege Soler0d and Ola Jensrud, Raufoss Materials Technology; and Ketill Pedersen , SINTEF Materials Technology. The performance of automotive components is strongly con- trolled by the costs in the process chain from melt to final shaped product. In comparison with other aluminum alloys the AA 6082 base alloy have a lot of advantages, highly formable, corrosion resis- tant and with high strength in combination with good ductility. The main objective of the research is to reduce steps from forging stock to final shaped product including heat treatment. The reduction of heat treatment time and the in-line processing of heat treatment and mechanical processing like forming is the main step forward. The basic understanding of the material behavior during processing like time, temperature and deformation are the main background for the development of new forging lines. The principle of microstructural control is kept as one key issue since the microstructure and the final properties of the product are closely linked. In the new developed Raufoss forging process the material even has better properties in the final shaped product in comparison with the traditionally manu- facturing techniques. The mechanical strength is shown to be more than 10% higher and the cost saving potential is significantly. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3418.

Comprehensive background and feasibility studies have been performed that show a novel very advanced automotive crankless prime mover, that is, a 2-, 4- or even 5-stroke thermodynamic cycle, twin-opposed-piston, crankless internal combustion engine (ICE), called the Fijałkowski engine-generator/motor (FE-G/M), has a great deal of potential in meeting and exceeding requirements for ride-by-wire (RBW) or x-by-wire (XBW) automotive mechatronic control system, comprising drive-by-wire (DBW) all-wheel-drive- able (AWD) propulsion as well as brake-by-wire (BBW) all-wheel- brakeable (AWB) dispulsion mechatronic control hypo-systems for smart automotive vehicles (AV), most of all, for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).

(P-368) Model-based drivetrain development and rapid prototyping for a hybrid electric car. Andreas Wagener , Herbert Kabza, Christian Koerner , and Peter Seger, Uni- versity of Ulm. Due to increasing demands on development time and function- ality, the traditional development process has to be overcome by a model-based development process. The latter offers many advan- tages concerning testing, evaluation and documentation resulting in lower time and cost requirements. However, this model-based development process is only feasible on condition of a proper simu- lation model and a suitable, adapted Application Product Interface. We have realized a model-based drivetrain development process which here will be demonstrated for a Series Hybrid Electric Dri- vetrain (SHEDt). In this paper, the main steps of the modeling process are shown. As an example for implementation, functionality and reliability of the process, the SHEDt storage system containing a DC/DC con- verter between DC link and battery is analyzed. 2001-01-3423. (P-370) Family of high modulus (HMG) nylon- based plastics increases mileage and reduce weight. Val A. Kagan, Jerry S. Chung , and Rowena McPherson, Honeywell Inter- national Resent developments were oriented on two high-flow, high- modulus grades fiber-glass reinforced nylon 6 (HMG series) grades for transportation, autos and other industrial applications requiring high stiffness, high strength and high fatigue resistance. These mate- rials combined the following improved technological (injection molding, vibration and hot plate welding, etc.) and mechanical per- formance properties such as greater dimensional stability, higher short-term (strength and stiffness) and long-term (fatigue and creep with the influence of temperature effects). Both HMG series grades Capron® HMG 10 and Capron® HMG 13 - are for injection-molded parts where stiffness, strength, impact resistance, and good surface and improved appearance are preferred. The current and possible applications of these plastics includes auto mirror housing brackets, clutch pedals, clutch master cylinders, ski bindings, steering wheels, levers, auto seat frames, door handles and door lock mechanisms. 2001-01-3424. (P-370) Weight reduction in the transportation market through low density SMC. Boris Gregl , 3M Germany; and Michael Sommer, BYK-Chemie. The purpose of this paper is to present the current European sta- tus on low-density sheet-molded composite (SMC) applications in the automotive industry. SMC already has a weight reduction com- pared to steel. With the use of Scotchlit™ Glass Bubbles in combi- nation with BYK®-Chemie additives, SMC can be far more improved in terms of the weight reduction, which is the primary benefit for the automotive industry. The formulations described in this paper were directly compared using automotive industry accepted test methods to quantify formu- lation differences. The final conclusion proves that the primary ben- efit of using hollow-glass microspheres in SMC, for the automotive industry, can be achieved by reducing the weight of SMC parts up to 30%. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3425. (P-370) Optimizing total cost of molded under- hood parts using high performance engineering polymers (HPEP). Kirit C. Desai, BP Amoco Polymers, Inc. To meet the increasing demands to enhance performance while reducing weight and cost, automotive engineers continue to find innovative ways to use thermoplastic materials for underhood appli- cations. Plastic provides substantial cost savings over other materi- als, primarily due to design and fabrication advantages. Capitalizing on these advantages for automotive applications require a far better understanding of material behavior at elevated temperature and a broad knowledge of design flexibility available from injection molding. When it comes to metal-to-plastic conversion, most designers still tend to think in terms of direct part-for-part replacement. As a result, development of plastic parts requires several cycles of "make it and break if which adds both cost and time to the overall develop- ment cycle time. Sometimes extensive delays result in a loss of proj- ect launch. This paper explains a number of design techniques to optimize the cost of a molded plastic part for underhood applications. It pro- vides comparison of cost versus performance, creep and chemical resistance for engine fluids of several engineering polymers. Also, it explains ways of optimizing the use of finite element analysis and flow simulation to shorten the product development cycle, as well as reducing the overall cost. 2001-01-3426. (P-370) Optimization of the impact behavior of injection-molded components through processing: A case study. J. C. Viana and A. M. Cunha, University of Minho; and T. Dias, A. R. Lopes, and M. Alegria, Simoldes Plásticos. This work validates a methodology to optimize the impact prop- erties of injection-molded semicrystalline polymers through the control of the processing conditions. This is applied to a case study: an interior door panel. The thermomechanical environment imposed during molding is assessed by computer simulations of the mold fill- ing phase, for a wide range of processing conditions. Two ther- momechanical indices are then calculated aiming at interpreting the microstructure development. Based on relationships between these thermomechanical indices and the impact properties of plate-like moldings, the impact behavior of the door panel can be enhanced. The results are experimentally validated. 2001-01-3427. (P-370) Gas injection technique - Part design and process capability. H. P. Heim, University of Paderborn. The gas injection technique (GIT) is a multi-component process, similar to the sandwich technique. By injecting inert gas into the molten plastic, hollow spaces are created in areas of the molded part. In order to reach the desired gas flow, it must be stated that the position of melt and gas injection is of particular importance. The requirements for mold filling and gas injection, will be shown using a sample molded part. Statistical methods, derived from well-known SPC-index Cp and Design of Experiments (DoE), have been developed for the evalua- tion of process capability before series production. The benefits for GIT will be explained. 2001-01-3429. (P-367) Improving adaptation equipment quality standards. Paul Gambrell, Motability.

(P-367) Active control of vehicle occupant's motion in front- and rear-end collisions. Mostafa S . Habib, Uni- versity of Bahrain. A new method to actively control the occupant's body motion in front- and rear-end impacts is developed. The independent motions of each of the occupant's head, thorax-abdomen, and pel- vis-lower limbs are described by a three-degrees-of-freedom nonlin- ear model. The feedback control effort is applied on the seat frame, which is allowed to move longitudinally in response to the body motion signals. To show the effectiveness of the current approach, simulation test cases representing front- and rear-end collisions to standard disturbing decelerations are presented and compared to the corresponding conventional restraint systems. In all cases, the cur- rent approach demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing the load and strain significantly on various parts of the occupant's body including the neck, thorax and pelvis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3431. (P-367) Vehicle accessibility. F. Dufour , CEE- SAR; and F. Lino and Y.-Y. Le Coz, LAB PSA Peugeot Citroën - Renault SA. This paper presents an experimental protocol allowing to mea- sure car accessibility motions and to evaluate associated discomfort feelings. The aim of these different approaches is firstly to acquire knowledge about motor strategies and secondly to be able to ani- mate a numerical ergonomie mannequin. A video optoelectronic system has been used to acquire 3D movements data realized with 4 half french car units. A 3D digitizer has also been employed to measure static postures allowing to size and animate our numerical mannequin. Five voluntary subjects have participated to pre- experiments. Collected data have undergone several examination processes in order to prepare the mannequin animation. In other terms, kinematic analysis of body segments will allow to understand and to characterize ingress and egress movements from vehicles. 2001-01-3432. (P-367) The seat thermal-hygrometric perfor- mance measurement and its correlation with perceived comfort. Carloandrea Malvicino, Stefano Mola, and Andrea Zussino, Centro Ricerche Fiat; and Jolanta Wolowicz, Politechnic of Lodz . The air conditioning system is becoming more and more a com- petitive issue, moving from optional to standard vehicle equipment. Therefore, also thermal comfort level is moving from simple air temperature measurement to a more systemic approach, where the contribution of every element of the car cabin has to be taken in account. Improving contact thermal sensation with the seat is one of the main issues to improve overall thermal comfort in transportation. A method has been defined to assess the perceived thermal qual- ity of seats taking into account the sweating human thermoregula- tory process. The method is based on a thermal manikin represent- ing a torso able to simulate in a portion of the back the sweating phe- nomena. The first part of the paper is focused on the instrument and developed measuring method description. The second part is dedi- cated to detail the correlation between experimental measurements and subjective quality index obtained during an extensive on-road panel test. 2001-01-3433. (P-369) Leaner manufacturing with precoated high strength steels. T. Koli, U. Eggers, and M. Höfemann, Salzgit- ter Flachstahl GmbH. The car manufacturing process benefits from a competition between different materials that have to fulfill such demands as lightweight, comfort and safety. For ecological and economical rea- sons low vehicle weights minimize the energy consumption neces- sary for transportation. High-strength steels enable to lower body weight by reducing sheet thickness and increase car safety by excellent crash behavior. A very important contribution to vehicle safety and value mainte- nance during the whole life cycle is the use of galvanized steel sheets to prevent corrosion and premature failure of crash relevant body components. Up to date the high standards in corrosion protection and appear- ance of the exposed car body in the automotive industry are verified by extensive surface coating processes, applied to the body-in-white by batch processes. Continuous coil coating of galvanized sheet steel is an extremely efficient alternative to the currently used sur- face finishing processes. The range of possible coil-coating systems expands from spot-weldable thin film coatings over EDP- replacements to complete body paints. Thin film precoated, galvanized steel sheets are comparably or easier to process in terms of formability and weldability as well as adhesive joining than their uncoated counterparts. Furthermore they yield better application properties like enhanced corrosion protec- tion, especially in cavities. This results in a possible elimination of secondary corrosion protection measures and leaner production pro- cesses. Thus, by avoiding, or shifting environmentally sensitive pro- cesses to the steel supplier it is possible to slim down the production efforts for high quality automotive vehicles. Precoated steel sheets offer a high potential to optimize car pro- duction in terms of environmental aspects and economical benefits. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Materials and Manufacturing 2001-01-3434. (P-369) MDB - A distributed database system to support cooperative product development. Thomas Fischer, Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering. Today, cooperative distributed teams characterize typical prod- uct development environments in industry. But such processes depend to a high degree on the availability of high-performing infor- mation systems, that enable and support cooperation in distributed teams. In general, the architecture of such systems has to reflect the characteristics of the cooperative business processes to be sup- ported. Although the necessary technologies, like database systems and computer networks are commercially available, the develop- ment and entrepreneurial use of distributed systems in engineering is still object of many research projects. The MDB 1 developed at Fraunhofer IAO is a prototype of a dis- tributed information system. The system specifically manages mate- rial-related content. It is currently used as global reference source for material knowledge in a global operating company producing gas turbines. The MDB uses a client/server architecture, but other than usual client/server solutions with a central server, the MDB is based on a distributed database system. Using a DDBMS 2 offers some advantages over traditional centralized client/server solutions or intranet systems. This article describes some results and experiences made in the development of distributed information systems. Although the spe- cific project referred to deals specifically with a material informa- tion system, the results are in general transferable to other areas of distributed information management in product development. 2001-01-3435. (P-369) Visualization of interdependencies in the product development process. Stephanie Aslanidis, University Stuttgart ; and Kristina Wagner, Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO. The development process is characterized by cooperations of teams of different disciplines. It is a special difficulty to transfer the information and knowledge between these disciplines. This is not a problem of a communication lack but often of misunderstanding. It isn't sufficient to provide more possibilities for direct communica- tion but the first transfer of information must support the compre- hension optimally. Such an information transfer may be managed by an information portal. Here is an important factor the way the information is visual- ized. We discuss whether and how the graphical design of a portal user interface can support the reciprocate understanding. 413</page><page sequence="413">2001-01-3436-2001-01-3445 2001-01-3436.

Particularly the consideration of implicit knowledge plays an important role when dealing with experiences and know- how of the employees. Thus the easy identification and knowledge exchange with experts is one of the topics. The iViP-method aims at supporting the user actively in doing his daily work.

(P-368) Soft air diffusion to improve the ther- mal comfort - A design approach based on CFD tool and virtual thermal manikin. Fabrizio Mattiello, Carloandrea Malvicino, Ste- fano Mola, and Massimo Magini, Centro Ricerche Fiat; and Anto- nio Tarzia, Fiat Auto. The cabin comfort is one of the most competitive issues in the automotive area of business. The thermal comfort and the environ- mental well being are fundamental performances that contribute to generate the more general idea of perceived quality. The CRF devel- oped in the past the concept so-called 'healthy bubble' that was implemented in the Lancia Dialogos concept car. The passengers are surrounded by an air bubble, created by generating low velocity air flows, that are diffused through the interior panels and components (e.g., dashboard, roof, back of the seats, etc.) and by surfaces tem- perature control (e.g., carpet, seats, etc.). At present the original idea has generally been accepted, and different solutions to diffuse air and to control surface temperature of vehicle interiors have been proposed by some automotive suppliers. The paper describes the CFD virutal design approach developed by Centro Ricerche Fiat to define the technical specifications of the breathable panels and their position to optimize the thermal comfort for different airflow conditions. The virtual environment includes a thermal manikin that allows the calculation of the standard thermal comfort indexes (e.g., PMV). This is a key point since passengers are no more allowed to change outlet positions in order to adjust the airflow direction that invests them. The approach has been validated on two prototype cars where diffusive panels (dashboard and door panels) have been installed. 2001-01-3441.

Stefan Becker, Hermann Lienhard, and Carl Stoots, University Erlangen-Nuremberg; Max Beier, Jörn Hofhaus, Dieter Schlenz , and Stefan Zemsch, BMW AG; and Edna Ryssel, Computational Dynamics Ltd. The specification of automotive ventilation/defrosting systems has often utilized 'trial-and-error'and "prior experience 'techniques. But design development and production efficiency has generated a strong interest in using more sophisticated design tools such as com- putational fluid dynamics. For this purpose a joint experimental and numerical study was undertaken. This comprehensive investigation was divided into two parts. First, the three-dimensional defroster flow field was measured using LDA in an actual automobile. Sec- ond, LDA and infrared thermography was used to map the flow and temperature fields for a two-dimensional jet impinging upon a slanted plate - a simplified representation of a car defroster geometry. 2001-01-3442. (P-369) Advanced welding technologies for magnesium alloys. G. Kohn, Rotem Industries Ltd.; A. Stern, Ben Gurion University-Negev; and A. Munitz , Nuclear Research Centre - Negev. Easily automated welding techniques are pre-requisite for their acceptance in the automotive industry. The acceptance of Mg alloys in this industry to replace heavier alloys depends therefore on the development of dependable automatic welding techniques for these alloys. Four advanced and easily automated welding techniques have been used to study the weldability of various magnesium alloys. Two of the welding techniques - Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW) and Friction Stir Welding (FSW) are characterized as solid- state welding methods, while the other two - Laser Beam Welding (LBW) and Electron Beam Welding (EBW) are characterized as intense energy welding methods. The integrity of the welds was checked by radiographic and ultrasonic techniques. The welded samples were further examined by standard metallographic tech- niques using both optical and scanning microscopy. The mechanical properties were studied using micro-hardness and tension tests. The results obtained in this study show that defect-free welds could be obtained in magnesium alloys by all of the aforementioned welding technologies. 2001-01-3443. (P-369) Welding and joining of magnesium. L. K. France and R. Freeman, TWI Ltd. The use of magnesium in a wide range of structures is expected to increase, together with the need to join it to other materials. Laser welding may be used for magnesium-magnesium joints, but other techniques will be needed for joining magnesium alloys to other materials, notably aluminum. It is shown that, for seam joints, fric- tion stir welding is a contender, while self-piercing rivets and clinching are promising techniques for point joints. However, much further development needs to be done both to understand joint per- formance and to prove their industrial applicability. 2001-01-3444. (P-369) Adhesive bonding of aluminum. S. Nij- jer, A. Bjorgum, and O. R. Lunder, SINTEF Materials Technology; and J. H. Nordlien, Hydro Aluminum. Degradation of adhesive-bonded aluminum in corrosive environ- ment has been investigated in terms of tensile strength as a function of pre-treatment of the surface and specimen design. The pre- treatment was found to play a major role in the degradation mecha- nism of adhesive bonded joints. Underfilm corrosion at the sub- strate/adhesive interface was observed on extruded and degreased specimen, causing degradation in the tensile strength. Etching and hot AC anodizing of the aluminum surface improved the adhesion and the underfilm corrosion resistance on non-ridged specimens. The results proved that specimen design can be detrimental when it comes to underfilm corrosion susceptibility of the bonded joint. 2001-01-3445.

For car body applications, e.g., no satisfying coat- ing system is currently available matching Class A surface require- ments for exterior car body components. In the first part of this paper, a novel multilayer coating system is introduced containing one layer based on silicone-modified organic resins which provides excellent corrosion resistance and an improved leveling behavior.

(P-369) Understanding as a new paradigm in the design of the intelligent systems in automotive and transpor- tation technology. Zbigniew Les, The University of Melbourne; and Magdalena Les, Monash University. Understanding is one of the most important human's capabilities that plays a key role in navigation and traffic control. The increas- ingly complex products and intelligent environment in automotive and transportation technology requires employment of intelligent tools called robots. The robots during their working session require interaction both with an environment and with the other robots and the task to be solved when robot undertakes one of the actions is often complex and difficult one. To be able to make decisions con- nected with the solving a difficult and complex problem, robot needs to be able to understand the task. The aim of this research is to investigate the new generation of the intelligent systems whose performance is based on understanding the environment in different areas of automotive and transportation technology. The shape understanding system is given as an example of the visual under- standing system where sensory information is transformed into the multilevel representation in the concept formation process. 2001-01-3450.

Cheshire, Staffordshire University ; and António R. Pires, Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal. This paper reviews the developments of the ongoing research into the application of CNC machining techniques to produce plaster molds and prototypes. The experimental work was carried out on an anthropomorphic robot that produces the near net shape plaster parts. The milling tests were carried out on plaster using conventional cutting tools (slot-mills). The tool failure analysis was based on the tool wear (Flank wear - VB) measurement. This work had comprised three phases. Initially, an experimental screening was carried out in order to identify the major important criteria regarding the cutting tool wear problem. The second phase corresponded to the development of a tool life prediction model for the machining of the plaster material. The cal- culations were carried out using the response surface methodology and the 23 factorial design. The experimental results showed that the cutting speed is the most significant factor to the tool wear process. Finally, results developed from a theoretical analysis with the tool life prediction model were compared with the experimental results. This est demonstrates the validity of the theoretical analysis and showed how the optimization process can be performed using this methodology. 2001-01-3452. (P-368) Study of an integrated diesel engine- CVT control algorithm for improving drivability and exhaust emission performance. Kensuke Osamura, Hiroyuki Itoyama, and Hiroshi Iwano, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Diesel engines have attracted more attention in recent years as one means of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from motor vehicles. One of the major issues for diesel engines is exhaust emis- sions performance. Diesel engines also face various difficulties in providing the driving force demanded by the driver because of their greater inertia than that of gasoline engines. Meanwhile, continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) have been popularized as gearboxes that execute ratio changes continu- ously without generating shift shock. The aim of this research is to achieve higher levels of drivability and exhaust emissions perfor- mance by mating a CVT to a diesel engine and making maximum use of the continuous ratio change capability. An integrated engine-CVT control algorithm that can freely set the driving force and also the engine operating conditions for gener- ating that driving force has been developed through this study. The effect of setting the engine operating conditions on exhaust emis- sions was made clear, and the driving force obtainable with this inte- grated control approach was analyzed. 2001-01-3453.

V.; and E. van den Tillaart and J. de Haas, TNO Auto- motive. Up to now, reduction of fuel consumption of vehicles equipped with CVT transmission has not been exploited to its full potential due to the reduced driveability when driving the optimum efficiency engine operating points. An ISG system with torque boost capabili- ties can be used to restore this driveability. This paper discusses the goals, the CAE simulation tool, the methodology used in the prepar- ative study for evaluation and dimensioning of a CVT-ISG concept, as well as the simulation results. The conclusions, generated from numerous simulations, provide vital information for the component selection, and for the development of the powertrain management system. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3454. (P-368) The effect of drive cycles on the perfor- mance of a PEM fuel cell system for automotive applications. K. Johansson and P. Alvfors, Royal Institute of Technology. The purpose of this system study was to compare the perfor- mance and fuel consumption of a pure fuel cell vehicle (i.e., with no battery included) with an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehi- cle of similar weight in different drive cycles. Both light- and heavy- duty vehicles are studied. For light-duty vehicles, the New European drive cycle, NEDC [70/220/EEC], the FTP75 [EPA] and a Swedish driving pattern from the city of Lund [Ericsson, 2000] are utilized. The fuel consumption for these drive cycles was compared with ICE vehicles of similar weight, an Ibiza Stella 1.4 (year 2000) from Seat and a Volvo 960 2.5 E sedan (year 1995). For heavy-duty vehicles, urban buses in this study, two drive cycles were employed, the synthetic CBD14 and the real bus route 85 from Gothenburg, Sweden. 415</page><page sequence="415">2001-01-3454-2001-01-3463 It can be concluded that marked improvements in fuel economy can be achieved for hydrogen-fueled light- and heavy-duty vehicles. The fuel consumption of a small fuel cell vehicle was 50% less than the corresponding ICE vehicle in both the NEDC and the FTP75. With proper dimensioning of the system components, e.g., the engine, further reductions in fuel consumption can be achieved. The range of more than 500 km with 5 kg of hydrogen in a 345 bar fuel tank was comparable to an ICE vehicle. If the pressure is raised to 690 bar, a driving range of 600 km could be achieved. As the auxil- iary system counteracts the increase in fuel cell efficiency, raising the minimum operating voltage from 0.6 to 0.75 V in a 50 kW fuel cell system, provides only a 5% reduction in fuel consumption. A fuel cell bus operated in the CBD14 and the bus route 85, compared with diesel-fueled urban bus of similar weight, demonstrates a reduction in fuel consumption of 33 and 37% respectively. 2001-01-3455. (P-368) US Army mobile fuel cell development program. Ashok S. Patii , Terry G. Dubois , Kristopher Gardner , Richard Jacobs , and James Stephens , US Army Communications and Electronics Command ; and Deryn Chu , Army Research Lab AMSRL-SE-DC. This presentation includes results of fuel cell research activities sponsored by the US Army for the last several years. It outlines cur- rent efforts and future plans. Fuel cells promise significant advan- tages in terms of weight, coupled with cost and/or logistics benefits. Military applications for fuel cells vary. Missions analyzed to date range from small man portable units of the 1-500 Watts and 180 - 12,000 Watt-Hrs to mobile auxiliary power units (APUs) in the 0.5 -10 kW power range. Military power source must be robust and capable of powering equipment under all environmental conditions. Fuel cell power sources have been demonstrated for several Military applications and are being investigated as a possible power source for the Soldier System, Robotics, Sensors and APUs. Much of the Army's efforts to date have focused on small battery replacement and hybrid fuel cell/battery systems. Example: Army development programs include: a hydrogen/oxygen unit developed in the mid 90s and currently under evaluation by NASA for future space missions; a 100 W fuel cell based battery charger developed by Ball Aero- space Corporation; and a 50 Watt fuel cell used to power remote sensor systems. Because PEM fuel cells provide quite, vibration free and low signature operation, a future application of these power sources are as APUs for combat vehicles. Although considerable progress has been made in reducing the size and weight of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, a key technical barrier for military applications has been the hydrogen supply. The effective use of fuel cells in the military will require a safe, high energy den- sity, transportable, reliable source of hydrogen. The Army's current and future research and development efforts are focusing on meth- ods of either storing or generating hydrogen on the battlefield. Hydrogen storage technology is considered critical to small military and/or commercial fuel cell systems. This technology area is of major concern and is being pursued in a host of commercial and government programs. CECOM, in a joint effort with the Army Research Office (ARO) and the Defense Advanced Research Proj- ects Agency (DARPA), is developing several promising hydrogen generating technologies. This goal of this program is a safe, reliable hydrogen source that can provide rates up to 100 Watts and an energy density of 1000 Watt-hrs/kg. For larger fuel cell units (&gt;500 Watts) it is imperative that the fuel cell power units be able to oper- ate on fuels within the military logistics systems. CECOM is cur- rently conducting research on catalysts and micro-channel fuel reformers that appear to offer great promise for the reforming of die- sel and JP-8 fuels. In addition to research work on PEM fuel cells and enabling technologies, the Army is also conducting research on direct methanol and solid oxide fuel cells. Fuel cells offer the prom- ise of size, weight and cost advantage over current military power source, however research and development work is still needed on hydrogen sources before this technology can be fully integrated within the military. 2001-01-3456.

(P-368) Improving seat comfort in a commuter train. Frank Krause and Robin E. Bronkhorst, TNO, the Nether- lands. TNO's ergonomie innovation group in Hoofddorp, the Nether- lands participated in the design of the seats for new commuter train carriages. They conducted a research project focused on improving the comfort. The project involved studying the commuter's sitting behavior and it involved several tests in which subjects representing the commuter population tested the seats. In a field test commuter's sitting behavior was studied. A unique number of 2000 measurements were taken to chart the passengers' activities, posture, size and movements. Back in the Netherlands existing seats serving as benchmarks were tested under controlled conditions. Eighteen test subjects were asked to sit for 1 hour while maintaining specific postures that resembled postures observed in the field test. Data was collected by using video, questionnaires (e.g., about local perceived discomfort) and expert meetings. Based on the test results modifications were made to the existing seats. They were tested again leading to the final design recommen- dations. From the benchmark seat, using the design recommenda- tions, the prototype was built. The benchmark and prototype differ regarding seat angles, lumbar support and headrest. In a paired comparison test the prototype was tested against the existing benchmark seat using methods described above. The results were positive: 83% of the subjects preferred the new seat for com- muting 1 to 2 hours. The seat scored better on important features like resting and sleeping possibilities, leg stretching and ingress - egress. The method of evaluating an existing seat to build a new seat appears to have worked. The American commuter will get a com- fortable to very comfortable seat. 2001-01-3462. (P-3367) Structural validation of motor vehicle seats by pseudodynamic analysis. J. O. Carneiro, UM, University of Minho ; J. T. Pereira and A. J. Rocha, INEGI; and F. J. Q. de Melo, IDMEC. This work describes the application of pseudodynamic (PsD) techniques to the deformation analysis of a passenger car seat sub- mitted to the load effect from humanoid dummy action during a car crash. The certification of this type of automotive parts is usually based in applying to the car/part a defined plastic deformation resulting from a laboratorial loading state, the most similar to the one that occurs from an abrupt deceleration coming from an acci- dent. The present work uses an alternative procedure to perform this test, where the action of the inertial forces resulting from the sudden decelerations during the crash, are updated along a sequence of time-steps in a hybrid numerical-experimental procedure, this con- stituting a PsD method. 2001-01-3463. (P-369) Agent-based middleware to coordinate distributed development teams in the rapid product develop- ment. Michael K. Diederich and Jens Leyh, Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering. Rapid Product Development (RPD) is a holistic concept for an evolutionary product development based on short iteration cycles. The employment of self-organizing teams as well as a target- oriented use of prototypes is of high relevance. 416</page><page sequence="416">2001-01-3463-2001-01-3470 As a consequence of the circular character of the stages of the Development process the involved teams are highly networked. Therefore, a significant need for coordination of distributed teams arises, to ensure a target-oriented communication and coordination of those teams with regard to the development process as a whole. Distributed development teams could only be coordinated, if they have access to all relevant information and their changes which arise during all iterative cycles of the product development process. Two mechanisms are the basic principles, which support the coordi- nation. Firstly, all pieces of information have to be saved in a data- base, in which the semantic coherences of information could be mapped, too. Secondly, the information and their changes must be accessible for each team on an individual basis regarding a further processing. Based on the state of the art only agent-based technologies seem to be appropriate to fit the requirements of the coordination of dis- tributed development teams. The coherences of agents which are used in the Rapid Product Development are exemplarily clarified at the temporal planning of activities and resources for distributed development teams. 2001-01-3464. (P-369) Cooperation platform for distributed product development. Volker Tippmann , Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering. In this paper the ongoing work on a cross-platform, cross-device co-operation software, that is being developed in the basic research project "Rapid Product Development' (funded by the Deutsche For- schungs-gesellschaft), is presented. Rapid Product Development (RPD) is characterized by a target- oriented use of prototypes, rapid iteration cycles and the employ- ment of self-organizing, often distributed, teams. The demand for coordination and communication between these development teams is typically very high. Objective of the software development is to reflect a "real life' RPD working environment and support distributed teams in the development process. 2001-01-3465. (P-369) Extending CoMedia: A service archi- tecture for grid computing in automotive design. Michael Mur- phy and Sajid Hanijf, Ryerson University; West Suhanic, Manage Data Inc.; and Thomas Fischer and Oliver Schumacher , Fraunho- fer-Institut für Arbeitswirtschaft und. Grid Computing is a relatively new concept that provides a high- performance metacomputing platform consisting of multiple com- puters connected using high-speed networks. The metaphor compu- tational grid is based on the electrical power grid, which provides ubiquitous electrical power. In the same way, a computational grid has the potential of providing ubiquitous computing power. Connec- tion of many computers at appropriate speeds has become more fea- sible with the recent deployment of high-speed second-generation optical Internet infrastructures, such as Internet2 and CA-Net 3 in North America and DANTE/GÉANT in Europe. These networks can interconnect computing nodes in a grid at up to gigabit speeds. This paper is an exploration of the potential of using Grid Com- puting services to serve the Automotive Design industry. The researchers first report on CoMedia, a joint Canada-Germany research initiative to provide multimedia and visualization services of use to automotive and industrial designers. The research team will report on extensions of this service architecture based on the principles of Grid Computing. Initially, large clusters of linux-based systems have been utilized to provide compute-intensive services such as 3D rendering using MPI. The paper will discuss an approach to utilizing spare computer resources available on a grid by use of intelligent agent technology such as aglets, which promise to improve node utilization based on node processor speed, spare cycles available or other important parameters. Finally, the paper will discuss the types of services that can be made available to designers, including visualization and modeling, as well as other computer-intensive methodologies such as finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics. The economics and performance of such a system will conclude the paper. 2001-01-3466. (P-369) Distributed planning in the rapid product development using adaptable process modules. Jens Leyh and Michael K. Diederich, Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering. The early phases of product development are especially impor- tant for the Rapid Product Development (RPD) concept. They are decisive for an efficient and effective way to the success of a devel- opment project. The basic research project financed by the Deutsche Forschungs- gemeinschaft (DFG) and the automotive industry currently develops a planning methodology that particularly focuses on the early phases of product development. These early phases are characterized by a high uncertainty and dynamic in respect of necessary alterations. This has consequences for the progress of the project. The planning of the early development phases can be facilitated by a dynamic planning system. By means of a configuration of the planning steps based on 'event-condition-action' that is build on the process mod- ules of a typical product development, it is possible to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the early phases of product develop- ment. Therefore, the use adaptable process modules to support plan- ning are necessary. 2001-01-3468. (P-371) Driving cycle, load and fatigue life pre- dictions based on measured route data. Günter Willmerding and Jakob Häckh, Steinbeis Transfer Center New Technologies in Traf- fic; and Alexander Berthold , MSC Partner Solutions. In order to shorten the length of time it takes to develop a vehicle, a system has been designed which combines actual measurements and simulation. Firstly, the route data is measured by a simple to use system. Based on this, a computer- simulation of a vehicle is carried out. It was found, that fuel consumption and driving characteristics can be predicted correctly. Fatigue life estimation is much more complex, but in the hand of an experienced user a reliable comparison of different compo- nents is successful. 2001-01-3469.

Mac- donald-Bradley, TRW Automotive. Use of non-metallic materials is increasing, with the need to pro- duce lighter, greener and more economical vehicles. This, com- pounded by the ever-escalating electronic content of vehicles for telematic and safety critical systems, increases the importance of safety and electromagnetic immunity. This paper presents work to quantify the changes in the electromagnetic immunity of a vehicle resulting from the use of non-metallic body panels. Use of statistics has demonstrated that increases (in current induced onto the vehicle harness) up to 10 dB can be observed, resulting from the use of non-metallic body panels. However these are no more significant than variations presently found between identical production vehicles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Electronic and Electrical Systems 2001-01-3470.

This paper presents a new contactless 6D motion measuring sys- tem for automotive test bench instrumentation. The measurement device is based on three linear CCD cameras, which are mounted on a fixed rigid structure. These three linear CCD cameras can track the 3DOF position of IR emitting LED' s in the environment. Com- bining three LED' s on one rigid body allows calculating the 6DOF position (positions and orientations) of a rigid body. Position and orientation of multiple objects in space are measured on-line.

(P-371) Topological optimization of automo- bile electric network. Valéry S. Tereshchuk and Sergey V. Fadeyev , Kazan State Technical Univ. The herein-presented paper deals with the determination of an optimal configuration of automobile electrical networks by intro- ducing the additional resettable fuses, i.e., polymeric Poly s witch fuses with the use of multiplex systems. In so doing, it is necessary to solve a number optimization problems on topological synthesis of systems of electrical energy distribution. In this paper, the mathe- matical apparatus of the non-oriented graph theory is used for the solution of these problems, in particular, in solving the distribution problem as a problem on finding of the graph median for specific subset of its nodes. We consider also the possibilities of using of dis- connected radial and turn electrical network configurations when introducing two additional blocks of fuses. The above-mentioned problems are formulated, with account for different configurations, as problems of linear integer programming with Boolean variables whose solution is reduced to the solution of optimization combinato- rial problems with the use of heuristic algorithms. 2001-01-3472. (P-367) Automotive design for NYH using MSC.visualNastran. Rashid Ahmad and Gerald Himmler , M SC. Software GmbH. Automotive industry is undergoing major structural changes and by the year 2010, there would be five to eight OEMs and signifi- cantly reduced number of 1st tier suppliers, providing at OEMs pro- duction line assembled systems and modules. This restructuring; pressure upon cost and time-to-market; and increased customers expectation upon quality, especially for NVH, has put a quite new set of requirements upon the vehicle development tools. MSC. visualNastran is an integrated product and process development tool, both for the OEMs and the suppliers to meet the above men- tioned challenge. Using this tool, the body shell structure and the various vehicle modules and systems from 1st tier suppliers can be optimized. The sound deadening material for the interior can be designed effectively using coupled acoustic approach. The total vehicle system can be tuned for various NVH-requirements. 2001-01-3473. (P-367) Analysis of dynamic characteristics of acoustic deflectors (II). Vytautas Ostasevicius, Jonas Sapragonas , and Donatas Dagys , Kaunas University of Technology. This paper summarizes the results that were obtained from inves- tigations of vibrations of cover- and box-shaped elements that cover assemblies of automobiles and are intended to diminish noise. The problem is that the elements in hand can appear to be the additional source of vibrations. For the elements fastened on the automobile body, the conditions for vibration excitation and recommendations for design are made more precise, at the same time keeping in mind that the main function of mentioned elements is not the reduction of noise. Our approach consists of three main directions: modifying properties of material, changing structure of elements and recom- mendations for choosing the preparation of its fixation points. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3485. (SP-1638) Estimation of combustion variabil- ity using in-cylinder ionization measurements. Stefan Byttner, Thorsteinn Röaldsson , and Nicholas Wickströ, Halmstad Univ. This paper investigates the use of the ionization current to esti- mate the Coefficient of Variation for the Indicated Mean Effective Pressure, COV(IMEP), which is a common variable for combustion stability in a spark-ignited engine. Stable combustion in this defini- tion implies that the variance of the produced work, measured over a number of consecutive combustion cycles, is small compared to the mean of the produced work. The COV(IMEP) is varied experi- mentally either by increasing EGR flow or by changing the air-fuel ratio, in both a laboratory setting (engine in dynamometer) and in an on-road setting. The experiments show a positive correlation between COV(Ion integral), the Coefficient of Variation for the integrated Ion Current, and COV(IMEP), when measured under low load on an engine in a dynamometer, but not under high load condi- tions. On-road experiments show a positive correlation, but only in the EGR and the lean burn case. An approach based on individual cycle classification for real-time estimation of combustion stability is discussed. 2001-01-3486. (SP-1638) High-speed imaging from consecu- tive cycles. M. Jansons , S. Lin , and K. T. Rhee , Rutgers , The State University of New Jersey. A new high-speed data-handling method has been developed by advancing the Rutgers Super Imaging System (SIS) (having four units of infrared digital cameras) in order to capture successive in- cylinder spectral thermal images at high rates from consecutive cycles (HSI-CC). The present HSI-CC method has been made possible by incorpo- rating recent advancements in digital data-handling peripheral devices and development of new dedicated computer programs including an MS Window-based operating system (WOS) for the SIS. The SIS-HSI-CC permits simultaneous high-speed imaging of four (4) sets of 64 sequential images (or 128 images) at rates of over 2,000 frames/camera/sec in each cycle, which can be repeated for as many as 150 consecutive cycles. This amounts to a data volume of nearly 400 mega bytes (in 12-bit dynamic resolution) in an exper- iment. Key considerations for achieving the system performance include a new technique of storing the image data and relevant engine measurements (e.g., pressure-time and fuel injection histo- ries) during the reaction period. The stored digital data is then trans- ferred to two separate PC memory packs during the non-reacting period. The image and corresponding engine data is reviewed in situ using the Rutgers Animation Program (RAP) (prior to conducting the next experiment). The RAP is a new computer program enabling simultaneous display on a PC screen of many (at present 50 pieces of animation) digital movies in a controlled manner, which is also used for analysis/presentation of raw and processed data. For exam- ple, the RAP can display results from 10 successive cycles of four geometrically identical spectral images and a matching pressure- time history per cycle. This new SIS-HIS-CC-WOS-RAP is employed in investigation of flame development during the cold start on a spark-ignition engine. Some of the results discussed in this paper were obtained during the first 100 firing cycles from the engine at 13°C (55°F). 2001-01-3487.

The experiments were conducted in a constant volume chamber with atmospheric condition. The pre- mixed charge composed of ethylene and air was charged with vari- ous equivalence ratio, the second charge with the same composition was injected into the chamber, thereafter, the combustion started by a spark plug. The phenomena were analyzed by use of the experi- mental results of shadowgraph, [OH] natural emission, pressure his- tory and NOx and UHC in the exhaust gas. 418</page><page sequence="418">2001-01-3489-2001-01-3495 2001-01-3489. (SP-1638) The effect of liquid fuel on the cylin- der liner on engine-out hydrocarbon emissions in SI engines. Hoon Cho, Manshik Kim , and Kyoungdoug Min, Seoul National Univ. The liquid fuel film on the cylinder liner is believed to be a major source of engine-out hydrocarbon emissions in SI engines, espe- cially during cold start and warm-up period. Quantifying the liquid fuel film on the cylinder liner is essential to understand the engine- out hydrocarbon emissions formation in SI engines. In this research, two-dimensional visualization was carried out to quantify liquid fuel film on the quartz cylinder liner in an SI engine test rig. In addition, comparing visualization results with the trend of hydrocarbon emis- sions in this engine, the effect of cylinder wall- wetting during a sim- ulated cold start and warmed-up condition was investigated with the engine experiment. The visualization was based on laser-induced fluorescence and total reflection. Using a quartz liner and a special lens, only the liq- uid fuel on the liner was visualized. The calibration technique was developed to quantify the fluorescence signal with the thickness gage and the calibration device. The fluorescent intensity increases linearly with increase in the fuel film thickness on the quartz liner. Using this technique, the distribution of the fuel film thickness on the cylinder liner was measured quantitatively for different valve lifts and injected fuel mass in the test rig. In order to compare visual- ization results with the effect of liquid fuel on the cylinder liner on the hydrocarbon emissions, the engine experiment was conducted with respect to injection angle and injection timing. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3491. (SP-1638) Quantification and modeling the effects of thermal shock on combustion pressure transducers. Paullus V. Puzinauskas and William M. Mathis, United States Naval Academy; and Matthew A. Dziecluch, LLC. This study's objective was to characterize thermal-shock errors on a specific Kistler pressure transducer and to determine if a ther- mal-shock correction algorithm using transducer surface tempera- ture could be developed. Atmospheric measurements were made using a thermal-shock rig which intermittently exposed the trans- ducer to a known heat flux while maintaining atmospheric pressure on the transducer diaphragm. Any change in output is attributable to thermal shock. Surface temperature was measured using a sepa- rate eroding-type surface thermocouple. The data showed a strong correlation between heat-flux-induced temperature change and ther- mal shock and were used in a least squares error estimation algo- rithm to create a model of the thermal shock as a function of trans- ducer surface temperature. The model was calibrated using baseline measurements and tested against measurements made at different heat flux intensities and exposure duration and frequency. The model was able to remove approximately 95% of the error under all tested conditions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3492.

Martin Ekenberg, SAAB Automobile/Lund Insti- tute of Technology; Raymond Reinmann and Eric Olofsson, SAAB Automobile; Bertrand Gillet, Ecole supérieure de V énergie et des matériaux, Orléans; and Bengt Johansson, Lund Institute of Tech- nology. During development of an air-assisted, direct injection combus- tion system, it was found that an air pulse during the late part of compression stroke significantly shortened the combustion duration and extended the lean limits of the engine. The effect of an injection of pure air through an air assist direct injector was studied with Particle Image Velocimetry, PIV. Results showed that an air pulse during the compression stroke significantly speeded up in-cylinder velocities, which also was showed in the heat release analysis. A system to use low density seeding particles was developed and is presented in the paper. 2001-01-3493. (SP-1638) Three-dimensional flow measure- ments within the cylinder of a motored four- valve engine using holographic particle-image velocimetry. R. Konrath, W. Sch- röder, and W. Limberg, RWTH Aachen. A Holographic Particle-Image Velocimetry (HPIV) system is developed to investigate the in-cylinder flow in a motored four- valve engine operated at 1500 rpm. Image aberrations introduced by the optical liner of the engine are optically eliminated using com- plex-conjugate hologram reconstruction that allows measurements near the cylinder walls also. High-resolution velocity measurements in different axial planes of the in-cylinder flow are made at crank angles from 60° to 285° ATDC. Prospects and limitations to full three-dimensional extension of the HPIV system are discussed. The results show the development of the in-cylinder flow in two planes with emphasis on large- and small-scale flow structures. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3494. (SP-1638) PIV measurement and numerical simulation of flows in automotive catalytic converters. Shi-Jin Shuai, Jian-Xin Wang, Qun-Long Dong, and Ren-Jun Zhuang, Tsinghua Univ. In this paper a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure flow velocity fields in different inlet cones under different mass flux conditions on a steady-state flow rig. Meanwhile, a math- ematical model of the flow in catalytic converters was established and simulated using CFD code. Validation of the model shows that simulation results have a good agreement with experiments, which means that the established model is feasible and can be applied to predict the flow characteristics in catalytic converters with different inlet cone configurations. Experimental and computational results indicate that the inlet cone configuration significantly affects flow distribution. For a conventional inlet cone, the cone angle is one of the key factors to affect flow characteristics and should be kept as small as possible in a design. An enhanced inlet cone can greatly improve flow uniformity in catalytic converters. 2001-01-3495. (SP- 1643) Quantitative 2-D fuel vapor concen- tration measurements in an evaporating diesel spray using the exciplex fluorescence method. T. Kim and J. B. Ghandhi, Univer- sity of Wisconsin. To experimentally investigate evaporating sprays under condi- tions experienced in high-speed direct-injection (HSDI) diesel engines, the exciplex LIF technique with the TMPD/naphthalene dopant system was applied in a combustion-type constant-volume spray chamber. The chamber allows spark ignition of a slightly rich C2H2-air mixture, and subsequent fuel injection into the high tem- perature and pressure products. A detailed set of calibration experi- ments has been performed in order to quantify the TMPD fluores- cence signal. It has been demonstrated that the TMPD fluorescence intensity is directly proportional to concentration, is independent of the chamber pressure, and was not sensitive to quenching by either water vapor or carbon dioxide. Therefore, the temperature depen- dence of the TMPD fluorescence was the only correction factor required for quantitative measurements. Using a dual heated-jet experiment, the temperature dependence of TMPD fluorescence up to 1000 K was measured. The temperature field in the spray images was determined using a simple mixing model, and an iterative solu- tion method was used to determine the concentration and tempera- ture field including the additional effects of the laser sheet extinction and laser sheet profile variations. The integrated fuel vapor concen- tration compared favorably with the measured amount of injected fuel for times when all of the liquid fuel had evaporated. The data indicate that early in the injection event liquid and vapor coexist at the spray leading edge, however the liquid length reaches a terminal value and the vapor phase continues to penetrate. The vapor concen- tration past the intact liquid length has an equivalence ratio from 2 - 3, similar to previous research. At temperatures higher than 1000K, the exciplex technique was found to have limited application due to thermal decomposition. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 419</page><page sequence="419">2001-01-3496-2001-01-3499 2001-01-3496. (SP- 1643) Application of spontaneous Raman scattering for studying the diesel mixture formation process under near-wall conditions. J. Egermann, A. Göttler, and A. Lei- pertz, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Niirnberg. A central point for the further development of direct injection engines is the optimization of the mixture formation process, because all subsequent processes as ignition, combustion and pollu- tant formation are mainly influenced by the local air/fuel-ratio inside the cylinder. Especially for passenger car engines the interaction between the spray and the combustion chamber walls is an impor- tant issue for mixture formation. For that reason this interaction was object of the investigation described. The investigations were carried out in a heatable high pressure high temperature chamber under typical diesel engines conditions of 450°C temperature and 50 bar pressure. A passenger car com- mon-rail system was used as injection system equipped with a 6 hole nozzle with common rail specific seat geometry, mini- sac hole geometry and double needle guide. In order to allow a detailed eval- uation of the quality of the mixture formation, a measurement tech- nique based on spontaneous Raman scattering was applied which enables the quantitative measurement of the local air/fuel-ratio along a line of a few millimeters. By the careful adaptation of the optical set-up it was possible to separate the weak Raman signals from the present background influences and this allows a distinct determination of the density of air and the fuel vapor phase. The measurements were performed at a distance of 2 mm from the wall directly above the impact location of the spray beam as well as inside the wall jet regime. For each observation time 180 individual injection cycles were used for statistic evaluation. The results obtained show the improvement of the mixture formation inside the wall jet in consequence of the increased air entrainment. Addition- ally to the investigation of the temporal development of mixture for- mation the influence of the injection pressure to the mixture forma- tion has been studied. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3497. (SP- 1643) Influence of EGR on combustion and exhaust emissions of heavy-duty DI diesel engines equipped with common-rail injection systems. Rajfael Schubiger, Andrea Bertola, and Konstantinos Boulouchos, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. At the Internal Combustion Engines and Combustion Laboratory of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich we are cur- rently developing low emission strategies for heavy-duty diesel engines that engine manufacturers can implement to meet stringent emissions regulations. The technologies being studied include high- pressure fuel injection (with common-rail injection system), multi- ple injection strategies (with pilot or post injections), turbo charging, exhaust gas recirculation (cooled EGR), oxygenated fuels and the optimization of the air management system. This paper focuses on the effects of exhaust gas recirculation (cooled EGR) in combination with very high injection pressure. Measurements were carried out on a heavy-duty diesel single- cylinder research engine equipped with a modern common-rail fuel injection. The engine investigations were conducted in different operating points in the engine map covering wide speed and load ranges. Results of the study indicate that: EGR increases the premixed combustion portion (though in a non-linear way) and reduces the maximum rate of heat release at high load respectively increases the maximum rate of heat release at low load. EGR increases the igni- tion delay and the combustion duration. The premixed portion has been derived from experimental data based on an algorithm that uses Viebe correlations. The NOx emissions decrease almost linearly with the EGR; extremely low NOx emissions levels (less than 1-2 g/kWh) can be achieved at EGR Rates up to 40%. A strong increase in the particulate emissions was measured with high degrees of EGR, but the effect can be significantly counteracted in a certain range by using very high injection pressures up to 1600 bar. BSFC tends to be higher for increasing EGR rates because of a less favor- able scavenging and longer combustion duration; the thermody- namic process is nevertheless still of similar efficiency compared to the one without EGR. However, the influence of the exhaust enthalpy on the turbocharger, and thus on the combustion system, is not considered in this study. Noise indication is higher, especially at low engine load with higher injection pressures. With the use of pilot injection the increase of combustion noise can be diminished. EGR allows to fully take advantage of a high pressure common-rail system and to operate the engine very efficiently and with low emis- sion (near or below the EURO IV limits). This investigation shows the potential of EGR combined with a flexible modern high-pressure injection system (common rail). There are no technical solutions for a full production engine consid- ered in this paper. Although the results have been obtained on a sin- gle-cylinder research engine, it should be possible to obtain similar emissions and BSFC on a full production engine. 2001-01-3498. Characterization of mixture formation in split-injection diesel sprays via laser absorption-scattering (LAS) technique. Yuyin Zhang, Tomoaki Ito, and Keiya Nishida, University of Hiroshima. Experimental results of a diesel engine have shown that using split-injection can reduce the NOx and particulate emissions. For understanding the mechanism of emissions reduction, mixture for- mation in split-injection diesel sprays was characterized in the pres- ent paper. A dual- wavelength laser absorption-scattering (LAS) technique was developed by use of the second harmonic (532nm) and the fourth harmonic (266nm) of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser as the incident light and dimethylnaphthalene (DMN) as the test fuel. By applying this technique, imaging was made of DMN sprays injected into a high-temperature and high-pressure constant volume vessel by a single-hole nozzle incorporated in a common-rail injection sys- tem for D.I. diesel engine. The line-of-sight optical thickness of both fuel vapor and droplets in the sprays was yielded from the sprays images. The quantitative information of the distributions of the vapor concentration and droplets density was further deconvoluted by using the onion-peeling model. As a result, it is clarified that the injection mass ratio and dwell between injections of double-pulse injection schemes have great effect on fuel distributions and air- entrainment inside the sprays. Using split-injection with a small quantity injected in the first pulse and an appropriately chosen dwell between injections is of importance for governing the amount of premixed burn. The subsequent injection of double-pulse injection schemes has a turbulent effect on the fuel-air mixing in the diesel sprays. The turbulent effect of the subsequent injection with a smal- ler injection ratio, e.g., &lt;50%, can markedly improve the fuel-air mixing by allowing more air to entrain into the spray. Thus, for a D.I. diesel engine, utilizing the turbulent effect of split-injection may enhance the combustion in the later stage and the re-burning of the particulate formed in the earlier combustion stage, reducing particulate emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3499.

Fettes and A. Leipertz, Friedrich- Alexander- Universität Erlangen-NüSmberg. Future exhaust gas limits for diesel-driven passenger cars will force the automotive industry to significantly improve the design of the vehicles respectively of the drive assemblies. Especially the con- tributions of soot and nitrogen oxide will be the main problems in the future. One possible solution could be the application of suitable exhaust gas aftertreatment systems, but since modern common-rail injection systems deliver more degrees of freedom referring to the injection process, again the optimization of the injection process could offer a possibility to meet the exhaust gas limits. 420</page><page sequence="420">2001-01-3499-2001-01-3504 In this study, a passenger car common-rail system, applied to an optically accessible transparent engine based on the AUDI V6 TDI engine, was investigated using a solenoid-driven and a piezo-driven injector, both equipped with the same injection nozzle. When using a pre-injection for the solenoid-driven injector, spatial coexistence of spray and flame could be observed over a large part of the engine cycle, because evaporation of the diesel fuel was too slow. The lack of oxygen in the areas where the flame could be detected enlarges the danger of higher soot formation as the conditions for an optimal fuel evaporation are deteriorated. Additionally, a significant wall contact of the spray cannot be avoided. The application of a piezo- driven injector showed that the fuel intake is now much faster but, due to stronger wave structures of the spray, which could be a result of better air entrainment, the tendency of developing a wall film is not higher. As a consequence, the fuel vaporizes faster and both, building a wall film and spatial coexistence of fuel and flame, could be avoided when dimensioning these systems carefully. 2001-01-3500. (SP- 1643) Quantitative laser diagnostic studies of the NO distribution in a DI diesel engine with PLN and CR injection systems. Frank Hildenbrand and Christof Schulz, Univer- sität Heidelberg ; and Frank Keller , Gerhard König, and Eberhard Wagner, DaimlerChrysler AG. The NO distribution in a directly-injected diesel engine with real- istic combustion chamber geometry was investigated with laser- induced fluorescence (LIF) imaging with KrF excimer laser excita- tion. The highest possible level of selectivity has been ensured using spectrally resolved LIF investigations inside the diesel engine. To minimize interference from both, oxygen and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) LIF the NO signal was detected around 237 nm, blue-shifted compared to the excitation wavelength resulting in a background contribution below 10% at the earliest detection timing possible in the engine under study (20°ca after top dead center, TDC). The in-cylinder NO LIF intensities were compared for differ- ent injection systems and operating conditions and correlated to variations in pressure traces and soot temperature measurements. Laser and signal attenuation were assessed in separate experi- ments using spectrally resolved O2 LIF detection with the same opti- cal path as in the imaging measurements. Attenuation is then mea- sured using the Franck-Condon pattern of the emission spectrum of excited oxygen. A comparison with model calculations shows that the main contribution to the observed attenuation effects is absorp- tion by hot, vibrationally excited CO2 Using these absorption data and an external calibration source the LIF intensities of a selected data series are quantified. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3501.

Paul Miles, Sandia National Laboratories ; Marcus Megerle and Volker Sick, University of Michigan; and Keith Richards, Zac Nagel, and Rolf Reitz, Uni- versity of Wisconsin. In-cylinder fluid velocity is measured in an optically accessible, fired HSDI engine at idle. The velocity field is also calculated, including the full induction stroke, using multi-dimensional fluid dynamics and combustion simulation models. A detailed compari- son between the measured and calculated velocities is performed to validate the computed results and to gain a physical understanding of the flow evolution. Motored measurements are also presented, to clarify the effects of the fuel injection process and combustion on the velocity field evolution. The calculated mean in-cylinder angular momentum (swirl ratio) and mean flow structures prior to injection agree well with the mea- surements. Modification of the mean flow by fuel injection and combustion is also well captured. Substantial changes in the tangen- tial velocity near the spray path are observed during the fuel injec- tion event and, after combustion, a radial profile of the mean tangen- tial velocity that favors turbulence production is developed within the bowl. RMS fluctuations show significant deviations between measurements and predictions over technologically important por- tions of the cycle. Significant increases in measured fluctuations -in the tangential component near the fuel spray path at start of injection (SOI), and in both the radial and tangential components within the bowl after combustion -are absent from the model predictions. Mea- sured fluctuations are anisotropic, and suggest turbulence produc- tion enhancing the tangential fluctuations near SOI, and enhancing the radial fluctuations after combustion. 2001-01-3502. (SP- 1643) Low emission and knock-free com- bustion with rich and lean biform mixture in a dual-fuel CI engine with induced LPG as the main fuel. Hideyuki Ogawa, Noboru Miyamoto, Chenya Li, Satoshi Nakazawa, and Keiichi Akao, Hokkaido Univ. Smokeless and ultra-low NOx combustion without knocking in a dual-fuel diesel engine with induced LPG as the main fuel was established with a uniquely developed piston cavity divided by a lip in the sidewalk A small quantity of diesel fuel was directly injected at early compression stroke into the lower part of the cavity as an ignition source for this confined area, and this suppressed explo- sively rapid combustion just after ignition and spark-knock like combustion at later stage. A combination of the divided cavity, EGR, and intake air throttling was effective to simultaneously elimi- nate knocking, and reduce THC and NOx significantly. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3503. (SP- 1643) Hydrogen combustion and exhaust emissions ignited with diesel oil in a dual-fuel engine. Fiji Tornita, Nobuyuki Kawahara, Zhenyu Piao, and Shogo Fujita, Okayama Univ.; and Yoshisuke Hamamoto, University of Kitakyushu. Hydrogen is expected to be one of the most prominent fuels in the near future for solving greenhouse problem, protecting environ- ment and saving petroleum. In this study, a dual fuel engine of hydrogen and diesel oil was investigated. Hydrogen was inducted in a intake port with air and diesel oil was injected into the cylinder. The injection timing was changed over extremely wide range. When the injection timing of diesel fuel into the cylinder is advanced, the diesel oil is well mixed with hydrogen-air mixture and the initial combustion becomes mild. NOx emissions decrease because of lean premixed combustion without the region of high temperature of burned gas. When hydrogen is mixed with inlet air, emissions of HC, CO and CO2 decrease without exhausting smoke while brake thermal efficiency is slightly smaller than that in ordinary diesel combustion. In particular, both smoke and NOx are almost zero and HC is low when the injection timing is significantly advanced although the engine operation becomes unstable. 2001-01-3504.

Mitsuru Konno, Shuichi Kajitani, Zhili Chen, Kenji Yoneda, and Hiroki Matsui, Ibaraki Univ.; and Shinichi Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science &amp; Technology (AIST). Dimethyl ether (DME) is one of the major candidates for the next-generation fuel for compression ignition (CI) engines. It has good self-ignitability and would not produce particulate, even at rich conditions. DME has proved to be able to apply to ordinary diesel engines with minimal modifications, but its combustion characteris- tics are not completely understood. In this study, the behavior of a DME spray and combustion process of a direct injection CI engine fueled with DME was investigated by combustion observation and in-cylinder gas sampling. To distinguish evaporated and non- evaporated zones of a spray, direct and Schlieren imaging were car- ried out. The sampled gas from a DME spray was analyzed by gas chromatography, and the major intermediate product histories dur- ing ignition period were analyzed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 421</page><page sequence="421">2001-01-3505-2001-01-3512 2001-01-3505. (SP-1643) Development of diesel engines fuelled with natural gas. Chengji Zuo and Junhua Zhao , Hefei Uni- versity of Technology . Natural gas engines have widely been developed in the world because of the decrease of oil resources and strictness of the exhaust regulations. This paper introduces the main processes of designing diesel engines fuelled with natural gas and ignited by spark plugs. Secondly, it analyzes a number of problems considered during the process of designing. As an example, authors introduce the charac- teristic of a natural gas engine converted from a 4125 diesel engine and discuss the performances of the prototype engine according to results of the engine bed testing. The result is satisfying. 2001-01-3506. A study of effects of design parameters on transient response and injection rate shaping for a common-rail injector system. Wanhua Su, Yang Wang, Tiejian Lin, Hui Xie, and Yiqiang Pei, Tianjin Univ.; and Shaoan Li, Gang Cheng, and Xiaobo Wang, Weifu Company Wuxi. FIRCRI -a flexible injection rate common-rail injector was developed. This paper presents the working principle and the con- figuration of the injector. As key technologies in development of the injector, a new fast-response solenoid valve was developed and 4 dimensionless design parameters of hydraulic system were pres- ented by through computer simulation and experimental study. The solenoid valve was deliberately designed so as to eliminate the hydraulic force acting on the valve. Other configuration parameters were also optimized so that the response time of the solenoid valve is 0.3 ms. It is interesting to find that the response time of the injec- tor is not only determined by the solenoid valve, but all parameters of the hydraulic system of the injector. The injector can realize pilot injection, which is less than 2.5mm3, at a controllable phase and multi-injections. The injection rate of the injector can be regulated as echelon and boot shape, according to the requirement fitting engine combustion system by change some parts of the injector. 2001-01-3507. (SP-1643) An investigation of the effects of manufacturing deviations of helical inlet port on the flow char- acteristics of DI diesel engines. Liu Shuliang, Tianjin Univ.; Shen Jie, Yuchai Machinery Company Ltd.; Li Yufeng and Xu Zhenzhong, Tianjin Univ.; Zhuo Songfang, Yuchai Machinery Company Ltd.; and Ren Lihong and Xiao Haodong, Tianjin Univ. The flow performance of the helical intake port has great influ- ence on DI diesel engine combustion and performance and so the helical port is usually an important, well-designed and sophisticated engine part. However, many errors or deviations may occur during the casting and machining processes. In this paper, a few sets of mechanism were designed for simulating different kinds of port deviation, e.g., port with inclination, vertical swelling and eccentric errors, etc. The flow performance of the port was tested on a steady- state flow rig to verify how and to what extent the errors or devia- tions affect the flow performance of the helical inlet port in order to improve the production precision so as to insure good engine performance. 2001-01-3508.

Khacef, J. M. Cormier, and J. M. Pouvesle, Université d'Orléans; G. Blanchard, Rhodia; S. Calvo, Renault ; and Y. Lendresse, GIE PSA Peugeot Citroën. No efficient catalyst presently exists for deNOx in lean burn con- ditions. Furthermore, actual catalysts generally deactivate during reaction. A cylindrical DBD non-thermal plasma reactor was cou- pled with a stable three-function catalyst in order to verify the nature of the effect of the plasma on the catalytic process. A mixture of NO/O2/C3H6 in N2 was used as a lean model exhaust. The plasma was found to perform two of the three functions: NO oxidation to NO2 and propene activation through the partial oxidation of the hydrocarbon to aldehyde or alcohol. A complete catalyst containing the first two previous functions and the associative chemisorption of NO (third function) was used, as well as a simplified catalyst con- taining only the third function. Results suggest an advantageous plasma-catalyst coupling effect on NOx remediation in accordance with the proposed catalytic model. 2001-01-3509. (SP- 1639) Cascade processing of NOx by two- step discharge/catalyst reactors. S. E. Barlow and R. G. Tonkyn, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; and J. Hoard and W. Foll- mer, Ford Motor Co. We present here a phenomenological analysis of a cascade of two-step discharge-catalyst reactors. That is, each step of the cas- cade consists of a discharge reactor in series with a catalyst bed. These reactors are intended for use in the reduction of tailpipe emis- sion of NOx from diesel engines. The discharge oxidizes NO to NO2, and partially oxidizes HC. The NO2 then reacts on the catalyst bed with hydrocarbons and partially oxidized HCs and is reduced to N2. The cascade may be essential because the best catalysts for this purpose that we have also convert significant fractions of the NO2 back to NO. As we show, reprocessing the gas may not only be necessary, but may also result in energy savings and increased device reliability. 2001-01-3510. (SP- 1639) Multi-step discharge/catalyst pro- cessing of NOx in synthetic diesel exhaust. R. G. Tonkyn and S. E. Barlow, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. In the discharge-catalyst treatment of diesel exhaust the dis- charge chemistry is known to oxidize NO to NO2 as well as to pro- duce partially oxidized hydrocarbons for the heterogeneous reduc- tion step. We find NO2 to be much more easily reduced to N2 on our catalysts, as long as there is a sufficient supply of reductant pres- ent. Unfortunately we typically find that a fraction of the NO2 is only partially reduced back to NO. Since much of the original hydrocarbon survives both the plasma and our catalyst, a subsequent stage of plasma will oxidize NO back to NO2 while at the same time replenishing the supply of partially oxidized hydrocarbon for another stage of heterogeneous catalysis. We present experimental evidence illustrating the advantages of multi-step discharge-catalyst treatment of NOx in simulated diesel exhaust. 2001-01-3511. (SP- 1639) Oxidation of carbon soot layer using pulsed discharge plasma. Toyohashi University of Technology Yoshihiko Matsui, Masayuki Hashimoto, Aki Sakaguchi, Kazunori Takashima, and Akira Mizuno, Toyohashi University of Technology. Simultaneous removal of NOx and carbon soot from diesel exhaust has been experimentally studied. We tested two types of plasma reactor (filter type and pellet type) to remove carbon soot and NOx. These reactors were driven by pulsed square high voltage. Simulated gas was used in this experiment. The filter-type plasma reactor consists of a stainless mesh tube as a high-voltage electrode covered with a quartz fiber filter (or glass cloth). In the filter- type plasma reactor, about 97-98% of suspended particles were effec- tively collected on the surface of the filter with a weak discharge (specific input energy value around 10J/L). The collected carbon soot was oxidized to CO2 with the SIE of about 200 J/L. A yield of generated CO2 per energy was 26 mg/kJ. On the other hand, in the packed pellet-type plasma reactor, carbon soot was efficiently oxi- dized to CO2 compare with the filter-type plasma reactor. A yield of generated CO2 per energy was 204 mg/kJ. With lower SIE of 50J/L, the experimental result indicated that the carbon soot obtained from the diesel exhaust was oxidized to CO2. At the same time 50% of NO was oxidized to NO2. Using C2H4 addition, more than 90% of NO was oxidized to NO2. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3512.

Hoard, Ford Motor Co.; and Alexander Panov, Pacific Northwest National Lab. 422</page><page sequence="422">2001-01-3512-2001-01-3518 A simulated diesel exhaust is treated with a nonthermal plasma discharge under steady state conditions. The plasma effluent is then passed through a sodium zeolite- Y (NaY) catalyst followed by a platinum oxidation catalyst. Detailed FTIR measurements of gas composition are taken before, between, and after the treatment stages. The plasma discharge causes oxidation of NO primarily to NO2, with methyl nitrate and nitric acid byproducts. At the same time, HC is partially oxidized, creating species such as formaldehyde, acetal- dehyde, CO and other partial oxidation products. When this mixture passes over the NaY catalyst, part of the NOx is reduced to N2, with the remainder primarily in the form of NO. Methyl nitrate decomposes to form methanol and NOx, and nitric acid is consumed. There is little HC conversion on this catalyst. Small quantities of HCN and N2O are formed. When the mixture then passes over the platinum catalyst, further NOx conversion occurs. N2O increases, and the remaining NOx is a mix of NO and NO2. HCN, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and other HCs are removed. Thermal cycling tests with barium zeolite-Y (BaY)-alumina-Pt catalysts show significant storage/release of various compounds. Net NOx conversion reaches 60-80% over a wide temperature range, albeit at rather low space velocities. 2001-01-3513.

F. Peden , Pacific Northwest National Lab- oratory ; and A. Malkin, and J. W. Hoard , Ford Motor Co. The catalytic activity of selected materials (BaY and NaY zeo- lites, and y-alumina) for selective NOx reduction in combination with a non-thermal plasma was investigated. Our studies suggest that aldehydes, formed during the plasma treatment of simulated diesel exhaust, are the important species for the reduction of NOx to N2. Indeed, all materials that are active in plasma-assisted cataly- sis were found to be very effective for the thermal reduction of NOx in the presence of aldehydes. For example, the thermal catalytic activity of a BaY zeolite with aldehydes gives 80-90% NOx removal at 250°C with 200ppm NOx at the inlet and a VHSV= 12,000 h1. The hydrocarbon reductants, n-octane and 1 -propyl alcohol, have also shown high thermal catalytic activity for NOx removal over BaY, NaY and y-alumina. We believe that this activity is due to the fact that in an oxygen rich environment these compounds can be thermally oxidized over the catalysts to form the important aldehyde reaction intermediates. 2001-01-3514. (SP- 1639) Experimental study on the oxidation of model gases - Propylene, n-butane, acetylene at ambient tem- perature by non-thermal plasma and photocatalyst. Taek Heon Lee , Jin Woo Song, and Kwang Min Chun, Yonsei Univ.; Bae- Hyeock Chun, Blue Planet Ltd.; and Young gy Shin, Sejong univ. Two features to facilitate chemical reactions at low-temperature, non-thermal plasma and the weak dependency of photocatalyst on temperature, have been exploited by many researchers to effectively decompose hydrocarbon emissions emitted until the light-off of a three-way catalyst in spark ignition engines. To develop a realizable emissions reduction reactor, as part of such effort, this study investi- gates for the three model gases, propylene, n-butane and acetylene: 1) the conversion efficiency of the emissions reduction reactor, which utilizes the effect of dissociation, ionization-by-collision of the non-thermal plasma and the photocatalytic effect of TÌO2, and 2) the concentrations of the products such as acetaldehyde, acetic acid, polymerized hydrocarbons and NO2. The operating parameters to obtain the plasma energy density ranging from 7.8 to 908 J/L were varied. When it comes to the plasma system, propylene, chemi- cally the most active, showed the highest conversion efficiency in proportion to the energy density applied to the plasma system. The other two model gases showed relatively low but substantial conver- sion efficiency for the energy density above 190 J/L. Among photo- catalytic candidates, TÍO2 supported on alumina processed by sol- gel technique was found to be most effective. The resulting conver- sion efficiency of Total HC reached up to 7 1 % for the reference con- dition of 2117ppmCl at 302 J/L 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3515.

Kwang-Seo Park, Dongyang Techni- cal College; Dong-Inn Kim, Hyeong-Sang Lee, and Kwang Min Chun, Yonsei Univ.; and Bae-Hyeock Chun, Blue Planet Ltd. Effect of various hydrocarbons on the plasma DeNOx process in simulated diesel engine operating conditions is investigated experi- mentally and theoretically. This paper shows the results of an exten- sive series of experiments on the NOx conversion effect of various hydrocarbons (methane, ethene, propene, propane) in the plasma. The effects of energy density, temperature, and the initial concentra- tions of hydrocarbon and oxygen are discussed and the results for each hydrocarbon are compared with one another. The energy required to convert one NO molecule is measured 13.8eV, 16.1eV, 23.2eV, 45.6eV for propene, ethene, propane, methane, respectively when energy density of 25.4J/L is delivered to the mixture of 10% O2, base N2 with 440ppm NO and 500ppm hydrocarbon at 473K, while it is 143.2eV without hydrocarbon. The best NOx conversion effect of propene among the mentioned hydrocarbons is due to the highest reaction rates of propene with O and OH. The second is eth- ene, the third propane, and the last is methane that has the lowest reaction rate. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3517. (SP- 1645) Combustion and emission charac- teristics of Fischer-Tropsch and standard diesel fuel in a single- cylinder diesel engine. Michael H. McMillian, National Energy Technology Laboratory; and Mridul Gautam, West Virginia Univ. The emissions reduction of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) diesel fuel has been demonstrated in several recent publications in both laboratory engine testing and in-use vehicle testing. Reduced emission levels have been attributed to several chemical and physical characteristics of the FT fuels including reduced density, ultra-low sulfur levels, low aromatic content and high cetane rating. Some of the effects of these attributes on the combustion characteristics in diesel engines have only recently been documented. In this study, a Ricardo Prote- ous, single-cylinder, 4-stroke DI engine is instrumented for in- cy linder pressure measurements. The engine was run at several steady engine states at multiple timing conditions using both federal low sulfur and natural gas-derived FT fuels. The emissions and per- formance data for each fuel at each steady-state operating conditions were compared. The cylinder pressure data was used to determine a suite of thermodynamic indicators, which are used to help explain the emissions variations between fuels types. An attempt is made to further deepen the understanding of documented explanations regarding mechanisms for reduced emission levels in FT fuels. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3518.

Robert Fanick, Southwest Research Institute ; and Paul F. Schubert, Branch J. Russell, and Robert L. Freerks, Syntroleum Corp. This study compared diesel exhaust emission from four different diesel fuels: a conventional low sulfur D2 diesel (0.03% sulfur, 28% aromatics), California Air Resources Board (CARB) diesel (0.015% sulfur, 8% aromatics), 'Swedish' diesel (&lt;0.001% sulfur, 4% aro- matics), and a Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) diesel (&lt;0.0001% sulfur, &lt;0.1% aromatics) fuel. The comparison included regulated emis- sions, hydrocarbon speciation, air toxics, aldehydes and ketones, particle size distribution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Testing was conducted using a Cummins B-Series engine installed both in a heavy light-duty truck operating on a chassis dynamometer and on an engine dynamometer. The chassis driving cycles included city, highway, and aggressive driving operation. Engine dynamome- ter tests included the U.S. transient cycle. Results showed that the fuel with low aromatic and sulfur content produced lower regulated and unregulated emissions when compared to a low sulfur D2 diesel fuel, and these fuels substantially reduced emissions although the engine was not specifically tuned to take advantage of the unique characteristics of each fuel. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3520.

May, Ricardo Inc.; Keith Vertin, National Renewable Energy Laboratory ; Shouxian Ren and Xinqun Gui, International Truck and Engine Corp.; and Ian Myburgh and Paul Schaberg, Sasol Ltd. The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process can be used to synthesize die- sel fuels from a variety of energy sources, including coal, natural gas and biomass. Diesel fuels produced from the FT process are essentially sulfur-free, have very low aromatic content, and have excellent ignition characteristics. Because of these favorable attri- butes, FT diesel fuels may offer environmental benefits over trans- portation fuels derived from crude oil. Previous tests have shown that FT diesel fuel can be used in unmodified engines and have been shown to lower regulated emis- sions. Whereas exhaust emissions reductions from these previous studies have been impressive, this paper demonstrates that far greater exhaust emissions reductions are possible if the diesel engine is optimized to exploit the properties of the FT fuels. A Power Stroke 7.3-liter turbocharged diesel engine has been modified for use with FT diesel. The combustion system was revised, an active DeNOx catalyst system and diesel particulate fil- ter (DPF) were employed, and a design of experiments approach was used to explore possible strategies to greatly reduce NOx and particulate emissions. Fuel properties, baseline engine test results, and optimized engine test results are presented. The optimized engine reduced NOx emissions by over 90%, while maintaining diesel-like thermal efficiency. This research highlights possible approaches for meeting federal Tier 2 and 2007 heavy-duty on-highway emissions standards. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3521.

Sorem, University of Kansas; and Branch Russell, Syntroleum Corp. One of the simplest approaches to eliminating refining and reducing costs of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquids is to use wide- boiling point cuts resulting in a fuel that has a T10 volatility similar to that of gasoline. Wider boiling point cuts may also result in fuels having larger fractions of waxy components. The role of blend stocks is important in evaluating the feasibility of using FT liquids as fuels due to these waxy components. This paper compares the performance of FT liquids, FT diesel, petroleum diesel, and multiple blended fuels in a VW 1.9L TDI to evaluate the feasibility of direct use of FT liquids. 2001-01-3522. (SP- 1645) Fuel effects on diesel emissions - A new understanding. Y. Kwon, N. Mann, and D. J. Rickeard, Esso Research Centre ; R. Haugland, Kjell Arne Uvland, and F. Kvinge, Statoil PKS Fuels Technology; and G. Wilson, Rover Group. The factors governing fuel effects on diesel emissions are com- plex. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between fuel physical properties and the engine control system can result in engine calibration changes (primarily injection timing and EGR) despite the use of sophisticated electronic controls. In standard pro- duction engines, fuel effects on emissions can be strongly influ- enced by these interactions, making it impossible to determine the effects of fuel changes on the in-cylinder mixing and combustion processes. This paper describes fuel effects on engine-out emissions from a European light-duty diesel engine. The calibration effects were eliminated using a sophisticated test bed control system to maintain timing and EGR rate accurately at the design settings. By these means, fuel effects on the in-cylinder process could be accu- rately determined. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3523. (SP- 1645) Effects of high temperature and pressure on fuel lubricated wear. Paul I. Lacey and Selda Gunsel, Pennzoil-Quaker State Co.; Jose De La Cruz, Southwest Research Institute; and Margaret V. Whalen, National Renewable Energy Laboratory. While standardized laboratory-scale wear tests are available to predict the lubricity of liquid fuels under ambient conditions, the reality is that many injection systems operate at elevated tempera- tures where fuel vaporization is too excessive to perform the mea- sure satisfactorily. The present paper describes a High Pressure High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HPHFRR) purposely designed to evaluate fuel lubricity in a pressurized environment at tempera- tures of up to 300°C. The remaining test parameters are identical to those of the widely standardized High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFRR). Results obtained using the HPHFRR indicate that wear rate with poor lubricity fuels is strongly sensitive to both tempera- ture and oxygen partial pressure and may be orders of magnitude higher than at ambient conditions. Surprisingly however, wear rate was found to decrease dramatically at temperatures above 100°C, possibly due to evaporation of dissolved moisture. Better lubricity fuels, such as those containing additives, are largely insensitive to the effects of changing either temperature or oxygen partial pressure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3524. Superlow-friction carbon films for fuel system components operating in low-sulfur diesel fuels. A. Erdemir, J. Kavich, J. Woodford, L. Ajayi, and G. Fenske, Ar gonne National Laboratory. In this paper, we will demonstrate the effectiveness and useful- ness of a new class of superlow-friction carbon films in alleviating the wear and scuffing problems associated with the use of low-sulfur diesel fuels in fuel delivery systems of advanced diesel engines. Specifically, using a well-established diesel fuel lubricity test machine, we will show that with the use of very thin (1 pm thick), super lubricious carbon films, one can restore lubricity and virtually eliminate scuffing and potential wear failures that can occur in low- sulfur, super-clean, and zero-sulfur (Fischer-Tropsch) diesel fuels. Test results from our study raise the prospect for using such carbon coatings to solve problems associated with the use of low-sulfur die- sel fuels and high injection pressures in future engines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 424</page><page sequence="424">200 1 -0 1 -3525-200 1-01-3528 2001-01-3525. (SP- 1645) Performance and emissions using water in diesel fuel microemulsion. Manual A. González D ., Her- cilio Rivas, Xiomara Gutierrez , and Aymara León, PDVSA Intevep. Alternative fuels providing diesel engine emission reductions are developed in order to provide practical solutions to environmental problems in different areas of the world. Diesel fuel emulsions con- taining water, considered as alternative fuels, have shown their potential to help reaching simultaneous reduction of NOx and PM exhaust emissions. In this study, diesel fuel microemulsions have been developed and optimized considering their cost effectiveness. Water is incor- porated into the fuel in the form of micelle structures, mostly using naturally derived surfactants. The finished fuel is visually transpar- ent and thermodynamically stable over a wide range of storage and handling conditions. Experimental work was conducted to explore the impact of water in diesel fuel microemulsions on CIDI engine performance, regu- lated and non-regulated exhaust emissions. Engine bench- experiments and field-tests have been conducted to provide detailed information as feedback for fuel development, and also to demon- strate the benefits of the fuel technology as a retrofit option to end users. Steady-state tests on two different engines used microemulsions prepared in fuels with aromatic contents between 8 and 25 wt %, and water incorporation varied from 10 to 17 vol %. A heavy-duty diesel engine was tested to analyze the hot-start transient emissions using a California Reference fuel as baseline, compared to microe- mulsions containing 12 vol % of water. In these three engines, power output changes were determined at intermediate and rated speed. Vehicle driveability and exhaust gas smoke opacity were measured on four urban buses operating at city service. Results indicate that NOx, PM and CO can be significantly reduced because of water in diesel fuel microemulsions. Under cer- tain conditions, the HC emissions can be increased, but this does not exceed the regulated limit for specific engines. It is noteworthy that NOx+HC emissions are effectively reduced as requested in the latest exhaust emission regulation. The non-regulated emissions deter- mined through gas phase speciation could be controlled so as to not exceed those with the baseline fuel used to prepare the microemul- sion. Power reductions can be optimized to be lower than the water volumetric content in the diesel fuel. There is evidence of improved fuel conversion efficiency in the combustion process. For in-service vehicles, adequate engine protection through improved fuel lubric- ity, long-term fuel stability and vehicle driveability can be all com- pletely satisfactory for end users. Exhaust emission reductions, in particular the exhaust opacity, can be visually noticeable to end users, which is quantitatively documented with actual measure- ments. Fuel microemulsions are shown to be a competitive alterna- tive fuel and retrofit option to provide exhaust emission reductions in diesel engines. 2001-01-3526. (SP- 1645) Dramatic emissions reductions with a direct injection diesel engine burning supercritical fuel/water mixtures. B. Ahern, L Djutrisno, K. Donahue, C. Haldeman, S. Hynek, K. Johnson, J. Valbert, and M. Woods, Supercritical Com- bustion Corp.; and J. Taylor, and J. Tester, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Research conducted at the Supercritical (SC) facility of MIT's Energy Laboratory provided visual confirmation of a single-phase, homogeneous water/fuel mixture near the critical temperature and pressure of water. Equal volumes of water and diesel fuel were observed to be completely miscible, and high-temperature polymer- ization of fuel molecules was not found. This is believed to be the first observation of a solution of diesel fuel and water. This mixture was subsequently burned under atmospheric spray conditions with very low NOx, smoke, CO, and HC. The results sug- gested that in-cylinder combustion in a compression ignition engine was warranted. Tests were conducted in a single-cylinder, air-cooled, naturally aspirated, 3.5 horsepower Yanmar diesel engine. The compressibil- ity of this new fuel composition necessitated a modified injector to provide smooth operation. An electronically controlled, common- rail injection system was developed using modified injectors to operate at temperatures above 350°C in the presence of water. Early results comparing injection and combustion of this fuel/ water solution with standard diesel operation were uniformly posi- tive. An 85% decrease in NOx and a virtual elimination of smoke was measured on an AVL smoke meter. Noise levels were reduced by 2.7dB. Efforts are continuing with larger engines and injection optimization. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3527. (SP-1645) Diesel fuel ignition quality as deter- mined in the ignition quality tester (IQT™) - Part IV. Luc N. AUard and Gary D. Webster, Advanced Engine Technology Ltd.; Thomas W. Ryan and Andrew C. Matheaus, Southwest Research Institute; Gary Baker and Andrew Beregszaszy, Natural Resources Canada ; and Harry Read, Kate Mortimer, and Garry Jones, BP Oil pic. This paper reports on the fourth part of a continued study on fur- ther research and development with the automated Ignition Quality Tester (IQT™). Research over the past six years (reported in SAE papers #961182, 971636 and 1999-01-3591) has demonstrated the capabilities of this automated apparatus to measure the ignition quality and accurately determine a derived cetane number (DCN) for a wide range of middle distillate and non-conventional diesel fuels. The present paper reports on a number of separate investiga- tions supporting these continued studies. These investigations include: (1) the development/validation of critical calibration, oper- ation and testing procedures, (2) the development of component/ parameter specifications, operating limits, etc., and (3) the assess- ment of the performance of the IQT™ for a wide variety of diesel fuels, when operating in accordance with the Institute of Petroleum (IP) test method (in the 2001 year book as a draft test method) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) draft test method. Performance capabilities were also evaluated in terms of cetane improver additive and blending component response. This paper also presents initial insights into the precision capabil- ity of the IQT™ and associated test methods, based on the results of two preliminary round robin studies. On-going co-operative efforts, aimed at furthering the standard development processes in both Europe and North America, are also discussed. 2001-01-3528. (SP- 1644) Uuburned hydrocarbons emission source from engines. Toshiji Amano and Kazuhisa Okamoto, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. A UHC emission source analysis was done for a lean-burn natu- ral gas-fired engine. The possible sources were chosen as wall quenching, crevices, too slow turbulent burning velocities, and flame quenching by excessive turbulence. By making each source analysis for each possible source, it was discussed qualitatively what the major source is, while engine geometry (crevice volume), equiv- alence ratio, and ignition timing were varied. It was confirmed that (1) flame quenching must have occurred in practical engines, (2) the amount of UHC by flame quenching is very successfully explained by Karlovitz number (Ka) and it is linearly correlated to Ka, (3) the magnitude of Ka at which flames quench obtained from the experi- ments exactly coincides with the author's classification at which flame starts to be quenched, (4) UHC from crevices is a major source at higher equivalence ratio, but UHC by flame quenching suddenly increases at lower equivalence ratio, and it becomes a major source, (5) the dependence of UHC from crevices on the equivalence ratio is very weak, but the dependence of equivalence ratio on flame quenching is very strong. 425</page><page sequence="425">2001-01-3529-2001-01-3533 2001-01-3529. (SP- 1644) Present day spark-ignition engine pollutant emissions: Proposed model for refinery bases impact. N. Jeuland and X. Montagne , IFP; B. Cahill, PSA ; and R. Faucon and A. Petit , Renault SA. Air quality improvement, especially in urban areas, is one of the major concerns for the coming years. For this reason, car manufac- turers, equipment manufacturers and refiners have explored devel- opment issues to comply with increasingly severe anti-pollution requirements. In such a context, the identification of the most prom- ising improvement options is essential. A research program, carried out by IFP (Institut Français du Pétrole), and supported by the French Ministry of Industry, IFP, PS A-Peugeot-Citroën, Renault and RVI (Renault Véhicules Industr- iels), has been built to study this point. It is based on a three years program with different steps focused on new engine technologies which will be available in the next 20 years in order to answer to more and more severe pollutant and CO2 emission regulations. This program is divided into three main parts: the first one for diesel car engines, the second for diesel truck engines and the third for spark ignition engines. The work reported here takes place in the spark ignition section of this research. Its aim is to characterize the effect of fuel formula- tion on pollutant emissions and engine tuning for different spark ignition passenger cars. The originality of this study is to use refin- ery bases as parameters and not conventional parameters: the tested fuels have been chosen in order to represent the major refinery bases expected to be produced in the near future. These results, expressed with linear correlations between fuel composition and pollutant emissions, will help to give a new orientation to refinery tool. The two engines presented in this paper are a Euro2 lean-burn engine (Honda VTEC which equips the Honda Civic) and a Euro3 1.8 liters stoichiometric-running Renault engine which equips the Laguna vehicles. On each engine, tests have been made on a steady state bench with variations of some running parameters such as A/F ratio, spark timing or EGR rate. Vehicle tests with the same engines have also been done: on a European M VEG cycle, regulated and unregulated pollutant emissions have been recorded. Fuel composition in terms of refinery base composition has a strong influence on engines emissions and running. Some effects are common to both engines, but differences can be outlined, linked with distinct running conditions. Reformates increase HC emissions for both engines. NOx, HC and CO emissions are closely linked and most of the effects of bases on NOx can be explained by partial burn, especially for Dimate and ETBE. The behavior of ETBE has been particularly studied in order to explain the differences induced by the engine type and the running parameters (A/F ratio, EGR rate, etc.) on the contribution of this base. Non-regulated pollutant (speci- ated hydrocarbons, oxygenated compounds) composition is directly linked with fuel composition and mechanisms of formation for some of them have been proposed. The conclusions of this research study will aid the judicious choice of refinery components to reduce diesel vehicle emissions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3530. Investigation into testing and controlling emis- sions of hydrogen sulfide from gasoline vehicles. A. Collier , C. Hillebrand, G. Kelly, S. Brett, G. Elliott, D. Blair, K. Sturgeon, P. Tancell, and M . Brogan, Ford Motor Company Limited. The prevention of automotive releases of the unpleasant smelling hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is highly desirable. However, the ability to routinely test catalysts for dynamic H2S releases corresponding to the real world has traditionally proved difficult. The work herein identifies the key steps taken to produce a highly repeatable (overall relative standard deviation of typically less than 10%) procedure capable of replicating H2S releases from wide-open throttle (WOT) events. The testing utilized a chassis dynamometer to test a gasoline vehicle (fitted with one TWC system) over a specific transient drive cycle with H2S emissions detected using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer and an infrared-detection-based system. The impor- tance of the warm-up and catalyst preparation parts of the test are discussed, including statistical analysis. A repeatable and short test suited to rapid developmental screening of potential catalyst sys- tems is also presented. Following test protocol optimization, the following factors are reported as to the importance to H2S releases: sulfur adsorption period, WOT dynamics (temperature and acceleration/deceleration rates), evaporative canister purging and fuel sulfur levels. Key control parameters to the H2S formation (outside of catalyst formulation and fuelling strategies) were found to be the sulfur load- ing (defined by a combination of fuel sulfur levels and adsorption periods) and drive characteristics. 2001-01-3531. (SP- 1644) Emissions of deuterated tracers from oil in light and heavy-duty diesel engine. P. Buttini, Enitec- nologie; and M. Manni, Agip Petroli, Centro Ricerche Euron. Deuterated n-paraffins and polyaromatic compounds were added to a reference oil to elucidate its role on the emission of Soluble Organic Compound at diesel exhaust. This work carries on from pre- vious investigations applied to fuel doping with deuterated com- pounds. Both direct emissions and indirect effects, due to dilution with fuel components and combustion products are investigated. Further- more the addition of deuterated compounds, is applied to calculate unburned percentage, to study the metabolism of lube oil component and can be applied to measure lube oil consumption. In this paper the results obtained on a light-duty and a heavy-duty vehicle fuelled with a reference fuel are presented. Particular attention was paid to total particulate and semi volatile phases. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3532. (SP- 1644) Hydrocarbon emission from com- bustion of mixtures of natural gas and hydrogen containing pro- ducer gas in a SI engine. T. K. Jensen and J. Schramm, Technical University of Denmark; and K. Narusawa and S. Hori, National Traffic Safety and Environment Lab. Engine experiments have been conducted on a gas-fueled SI engine. The engine was fueled with natural gas and mixtures of nat- ural gas and hydrogen-containing producer gas in order to examine the effect of addition of producer gas on the combustion process and the engine-out emissions. The experiments showed that addition of producer gas decreased the UHC emission at conditions leaner than ë = 1 .40. The CO emis- sion was increased by addition of producer gas. This was mainly caused by unburned fuel CO from the producer gas. No effect of producer gas on the NOx emission was detected. Formaldehyde, which is suspected to cause odor problems from natural gas-fired- engine-based power plants, was measured using FTIR. The investi- gation showed that the formaldehyde emission was decreased sig- nificantly by addition of producer gas to natural gas. The in-cylinder HC concentration at the vicinity of the spark plug and the UHC concentration in the exhaust port near the valve was measured using Fast Response FID (FFID). The manifold FFID measurements showed that the reduction in the total engine-out UHC emission by addition of producer gas is mainly caused by a reduction in cyclic variations and only to a minor extent by a general lower UHC level. It was found that the lower cyclic variation in the UHC emission for the mixed fuel was caused by an enhancement of the post oxidation processes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3533.

However, as a drawback, this method leads to a higher emissions of Unburned Hydro-Carbons, UHC, compared to stoi- chiometric combustion. In order to gain a better understanding of what is causing the higher UHC emission at lean-burn condition, engine experiments have been carried out on a four-cylinder natural gas-fueled SI engine. The concentration of UHC in the exhaust man- ifold and the HC concentration in the vicinity of the spark plug have been measured during the experiments using a Fast Response FID (FFTD) analyzer. Using a model describing the outflow from the cyl- inder during the exhaust stroke and the measured UHC concentra- tion in the manifold near the exhaust valve, the UHC emissions from the individual cycles have been determined. The investigation showed that under lean-burn conditions, cycle-by-cycle variation had a significant importance on the total UHC emission from the engine. Both random, and non-random, variations were observed. The random variations were caused by random variations of, for example, the in-cylinder fluid motion. From the in-cylinder FFID measurement, the excess of air was determined from the individual cycles and it was found that the excess of air was oscillating. The oscillation was probably caused by the ë -control system of the engine and it was leading to significant variations in the UHC emis- sion, especially at very lean conditions. 2001-01-3534. (SP- 1644) Cutting the noxious emissions in 2-stroke engines. Mikko Pitkänen and Keijo Torkkell, Kemira Met- alkat Oy ; Anu Jäntti, Technical Research Center of Finland; Sari Laanti, Fortum Oil and Gas Oy; Tuomo Lapinlampi , O ulu Regional Institute of Occupational Health; and Esa Elonen, MTT Agrifood Research. The effect of gasoline composition, oil composition and catalytic converters on the emissions of 2-stroke chain saws was demon- strated. Measurements were made in a laboratory test bench and in working conditions. The samples were collected constantly from the breathing zone of the worker and from the surface of one's clothing. In addition to this, the specimens of blood and urine taken after working day were analyzed. A non-aromatic alkylate gasoline pro- duced significantly lower amount of noxious emissions compared to standard gasoline. The exposure to aromatic and PAH emissions were remarkably reduced. This progress was further promoted by oxygenate addition to alkylate gasoline. The catalytic converter was found active on hydrocarbons, especially PAHs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3535. (SP- 1644) Evaluation of fluorocarbon polymer bag material for near-zero exhaust emission measurement. Edward I. Sun and Wayne N. McMahon, California Air Resources Board. When the California Air Resources Board (ARB) adopted auto- motive exhaust emission standards for Super Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicles (SULEV), new challenges were encountered for accurately measuring exhaust emissions. This is especially true for measuring NMOG emissions (NMHC and carbonyls) where the SULEV stan- dard is 0.010 g/mi. One of the challenges in accurately measuring NMHC emissions is to find a clean sample bag material that has no or very low outgassing of hydrocarbons. Tediar, the bag material commonly used for exhaust emission sampling, has been found to emit N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), which interferes with hydro- carbon measurements and can contribute to significant error in SULEV hydrocarbon emission measurements. Several fluorocarbon materials were tested for hydrocarbon (HC) outgassing and carbon dioxide (CO2) permeation. The materials include Tediar, Baked Tediar, KynarFlex 2750, Baked KynarFlex 2800, Teflon FEP, TFM TFE, Tefzel, and Halar. The test methods included measuring HC outgassing of sample bags filled in dry zero air at 60 minutes and measuring carbon dioxide permeation of sam- ple bags filled with 2% CO2 at 60 minutes. Since moisture content of the source gas may affect outgassing, tests were also performed using humidified zero air. Based on the potential effect of outgass- ing on hydrocarbon measurements and CO2 permeation on fuel economy measurements, material performance criteria are recom- mended. Tentative criteria are that hydrocarbon outgassing should be less than 15 ppbCi at 60 minutes using both dry and humidified zero air as source gases, and CO2 permeation should be less than 0.2% at 60 minutes using a 2% CO2 source gas. Of the material tested, only baked Tediar met both criteria. Some of the other mate- rials tested may meet criteria using alternative treatments of the material. Since a precise and accurate hydrocarbon gas analyzer is needed for this testing, this paper also describes the calibration and determi- nation of the limit of detection (LOD) of the Horiba 726LE Flame Ionization Detector (FID) hydrocarbon analyzer in the Horiba MEXA LE emission analyzer system. The LOD was calculated to be 3 ppbCi. Such precision supports the reliability of the hydrocar- bon outgassing data. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3536. (SP- 1644) Relationships between instanta- neous and measured emissions in heavy-duty applications. Baskaran Ganesan and Nigel N. Clark, West Virginia Univ. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), using urea injection, is being examined as a method for substantial reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) for diesel engines, but the urea injection rates must be controlled to match the NOx production which may need to be predicted during open loop control. Unfortunately NOx is usually measured in the laboratory using a full-scale dilution tunnel and chemiluminescent analyzer, which cause delay and diffusion (in time) of the true manifold NOx concentration. Similarly, delay and diffusion of measurements of all emissions cause the task of creating instantaneous emissions models for vehicle simulations more diffi- cult. Data were obtained to relate injections of carbon dioxide (CO2) into a tunnel with analyzer measurements. The analyzer response was found to match a gamma distribution of the input pulse, so that the analyzer output could be modeled from the tunnel CO2 input. The relationship between measured carbon dioxide and diffused power was established for a heavy-duty engine and was used to pre- dict instantaneous emissions of carbon dioxide for various engine test cycles. The gamma function was then used to diffuse the implied carbon dioxide concentrations to yield a modeled analyzer output. The transient model and actual analyzer levels responded well. Similarly, the emissions measurements for oxides of nitrogen were modeled and agreed well. This research represents verification of the 'forward transform' between actual 'engine out' and mea- sured emissions. Future research will examine the 'reverse trans- form' and will consider issues of uniqueness of the solution. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3537. (SP- 1644) Operating envelopes of hybrid bus engines. Nigel N. Clark, Akunor Azu, and Ronald Jarrett, West Vir- ginia Univ.; Thomas Balon and Paul Moynihan, M.J. Bradley &amp; Associates ; Sheila Lynch, Northeast Advanced Vehicle Consortium; and Thomas Webb, BAE SYSTEMS Controls. Recent chassis testing of hybrid buses demonstrated the potential of hybrid technology to reduce emissions and raise fuel economy relative to conventional buses. However, hybrid buses represent a certification quandary because the engines must be certified using the accepted Federal Test Procedure (FTP), without regard for bene- fits that may arise from less transient engine operation. Actual engine operating data from series configuration hybrid buses were analyzed to determine the envelopes of torque and speeds covered by the engine. Transient engine operation was also considered in terms of rates of change of torque, power and speed. These measures did not compare closely with similar measures computed from the FTP because the series hybrid engines explored a more structured zone of operation than the FTP implied and because the FTP repre- sented more transient operation.

(SP-1644) Ammonia emissions from the EPA's light-duty test vehicle. Richard C. Shores , John T. Walker , Jr., and ■ Larry G. Jones , U. S. Environmental Protection Agency; M. O. Rod- gers and James R. Pearson , Georgia Institute of Technology ; and Ronald B. McCulloch, North Carolina Division of Air Quality . Ammonia (NH3) emissions were measured from the EPA's Light-Duty Test Vehicle while operated on a chassis dynamometer. The vehicle's (1993 Chevrolet equipped with a three-way catalyst) emissions were measured for three transient (urban driving, high- way fuel economy, and hard acceleration) cycles and steady-state operation. Previous research has shown that NH3 is predominately emitted from vehicles with a catalyst (three-way or dual-bed). The vehicle's catalyst is designed to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) during normal operation. The reduc- tion of NOx to NH3 occurs during periods of reducing conditions when insufficient O2 is available. NH3 emissions were measured during fuel-rich/reduced-02 conditions (open-loop control scheme). The results demonstrate that NH3 production is correlated to com- bustion conditions. The results also show that the amount of NH3 produced correlates with the amount of time that the vehicle remains in the open-loop control scheme. The significance of this finding is that NH3 production can be predicted for a fleet based on the fre- quency of enrichment of vehicles equipped with a three-way cata- lyst. The results also provide a means of determining the location of roadway links and/or specific locations where NH3 production can be anticipated based on predicted engine power. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3539. (SP-1644) Air-to-fuel ratio modulation experi- ments over a Pd/Rh three-way catalyst. Stephen J. Cornelius, Nick Collings, and Keith Glover, University of Cambridge ; and Daniel E. Davison, University of Waterloo. The benefits of deliberately modulating air-to-fuel ratio over a three-way catalyst are disputed. In this work, engine test cell experi- ments were carried out to assess the performance of a warmed-up Pd/Rh three-way catalyst. The objectives were threefold: first, to determine the best mode of operation; second, to determine if air-to- fuel ratio modulation enhances robustness to transient air-to-fuel ratio disturbances; third, to determine if the conversion efficiency can be manipulated by controlling the shape of the air-to-fuel ratio oscillation. It was observed that the highest conversion efficiency is obtained using a steady air-to-fuel ratio just rich of stoichiometric; however, this mode of operation lacks robustness with respect to transient disturbances and UEGO sensor errors. Robustness can be improved using an oscillating air-to-fuel ratio, but with a sacrifice in peak conversion efficiency. Definite conclusions regarding the benefits of various waveform shapes could not be drawn, but a peri- odic triangular air-to-fuel ratio input which ramps to the lean slower than it ramps to the rich appears to have superior efficiency than a waveform which ramps to the rich slower than it ramps to die lean. 2001-01-3540. (SP-1644) Transient SI engine emissions mea- surements on the FTP75 drive cycle with a fast response CO instrument. Tim Hands, Mark Peckham, and Bruce Campbell, Combustion, Ltd.; and Cory Sutela, Cambridge Univ. This paper describes the application of a non-dispersive infrared- based instrument designed to measure CO with a response time of 7ms. Spark ignition engine emission measurements recorded during the first 505 seconds of an FTP75 drive-cycle for a 4-cylinder engine are presented, including fast response hydrocarbon and NO measurements. An analysis of the engine-out (pre-catalyst) exhaust gas is provided. Data collected simultaneously with a standard emis- sions test stand and conventional dilution tunnel are compared to the high frequency measurements. Fast CO analysis provides new insight into cold-start fuelling calibration and cylinder-to-cylinder AFR variation. Under rich conditions, the strong dependence of CO production on the quantity of excess fuel allows a significantly faster estimate of engine stoichiometry than a UEGO sensor. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3541. Laboratory assessment of the oxidation and wear performance capabilities of low phosphorus engine oils. Milton D. Johnson, Stefan Korcek, Ronald K. Jensen, Arup K. Gan- gopadhyay , and Edward A. Soltis, Ford Motor Co. Meeting upcoming stringent emission standards will require that exhaust gas catalyst systems become active very quickly, function at very high efficiencies and maintain those capabilities at high mileages. This means that contamination of the catalysts by engine oil-derived poisons must be minimized. Phosphorus compounds, derived from the zinc dialkyldithio-phosphate (ZDTP) additives that provide antiwear and antioxidant activity, are a principal contami- nant that can increase catalyst light-off times and reduce catalyst efficiency. Therefore, reducing the concentration of, or eliminating, phosphorus in engine oils is desirable. Doing so, however, requires that oils be reformulated to ensure that wear protection will not be compromised and that oxidation stability will be maintained. To address these concerns, laboratory tests for evaluating oil oxidation and wear performance have been developed and used to evaluate developmental low phosphorus oils. Results indicate that good wear performance and oxidation control can be obtained with ZDTP con- centrations that are half of current levels (0.05% vs. 0.10%, maxi- mum, for GF-3 oils). 2001-01-3544. Analysis of oil consumption behavior during ramp transients in a production spark ignition engine. Ertan Yil- maz, Benoist Thirouard, Tian Tian, Victor W. Wong, and John B. Heywood, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Nicholas Lee, PSA Peugeot Citroën. Engine oil consumption is recognized to be a significant source of pollutant emissions. Unburned or partially burned oil in the exhaust gases contributes directly to hydrocarbon and particulate emissions. In addition, chemical compounds present in oil additives poison catalytic converters and reduce their conversion efficiency. Oil consumption can increase significantly during critical non- steady operating conditions. This study analyzes the oil consump- tion behavior during ramp transients in load by combining oil con- sumption measurements, in-cylinder measurements, and computer- based modeling. A sulfur-based oil consumption method was used to measure real-time oil consumption during ramp transients in load at constant speed in a production spark ignition engine. Additionally in-cylinder liquid oil behavior along the piston was studied using a one-point Laser-Induced-Fluorescence (LIF) technique. Land pressure traces and engine blowby were measured to analyze oil transport along the piston and models that predict ring dynamics and gas flows were used to analyze the transient oil consumption behavior. A sudden increase of oil consumption to a level significantly higher than the steady-state values was observed during transient measurements from low load to higher load conditions. During these transients, oil consumption reached a peak and then gradually decreased to the steady-state level of the final operating condition. This phenomenon occurred at all speed conditions investigated. LIF results showed significant decrease of accumulated oil on the piston after the transients. However, this difference of oil accumulated could not explain the total extra oil consumed during the transition. Further analysis with the ring dynamics and gas flow models sug- gested that the oil flow driven by the reverse gas flow through the top ring groove was the source for the excess of oil consumed. This hypothesis was supported using observations on a one-cylinder research engine with the same ring-pack and engine design. Images acquired using 2-D LIF during the same load transients clearly showed liquid oil outflow from the top ring groove. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 428</page><page sequence="428">2001-01-3545-2001-01-3554 2001-01-3545. The effect of engine age, engine oil age and drain intervaí on vehicle tailpipe emissions and fuel efficiency. Thomas R. Smith and Victor Kersey , Valvoline Co.; and Thomas Bidwell, Ashland Inc. A field study was conducted to determine the impact of engine age, engine oil age, drain interval, and engine oil formulation on vehicle tailpipe emissions and fuel efficiency. FTP/HFET emissions and fuel economy testing was conducted on Ford Vans powered by Ford V10 6.8-liter gasoline engines at the start of the drain period, mid-way through the drain period and at the end of the drain period. This work was conducted with approximately 50,000 miles on the engine and then repeated at 100,000 miles. It was found that engine age, oil age and drain interval influenced emissions and fuel effi- ciency. These influences are discussed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3546. Diagnostic of knocking by wavelet transform method utilizing real signal as mother wavelet. Zhong Zhang, Industrial Technology Center of Okayama Prefecture ; and Eiji Tornita, Okayama Univ. It is well known that the wavelet transform is a useful time- frequency analysis method for an unsteady signal and major atten- tion has been focused on the selection of the mother wavelet (MW) because the MW plays an important role in the wavelet transform. In this study, we analyze the pressure signal in a spark-ignition engine and the vibration of the engine block measured by a knock sensor under the knocking conditions when knocking is caused. We then propose a new method of the knocking detection that utilizes the knocking signal measured with a knock sensor as a MW. We call this method the Instantaneous Correlation Method (ICM). The degree of similarity between the MW and the vibration of the engine block was judged and only the knocking signal from the vibration of the engine block was extracted. The results obtained here show that the method proposed in this study is useful for knocking detec- tion even if the engine speed is very high of 6000 rpm. 2001-01-3547. A study of the influence of bore shape on the performance of a large-end bearing. Ducai Wang and Graham J. Jones, Glacier Vandervell Bearings ; and Bob Sturk, Glacier Vandervell North America. This paper used an elasto-hydrodynamic model of a connecting rod large-end bearing to investigate the influence that the shape of the bearing bore had on the performance of the bearing system. Comparisons were made between cylindrical shapes, eccentrically bored shapes and complex shapes, i.e., the 'Conecc' profile. The effect of 'cap-shift' was also investigated together with effective- ness of joint face relief in overcoming some of its adverse effects. 2001-01-3548. Tribologically optimized ceramic coatings for cylinder liners in advanced combustion engines. M. Buchmann and R. Gadow, Institute for Manufacturing Technologies of Ceramic Components and. Recent automotive engineering developments concerning fuel consumption regulations and decreasing material and manufacturing cost result in an increasing utilization of light metal components for automotive applications. Significant weight savings are obtained by changing the engine block material from cast iron to aluminum. Since all parts of a combustion engine interact as a system, the indi- vidual components must sustain the combustion pressure and tem- perature as well as wear and friction effects of moving surfaces in different environment and lubrication. Approaches to increase combustion as well as operation effi- ciency and lifetime of light metal engines are ceramic and cermet coatings on the cylinder liners of die-casted aluminum crankcases. Such functional and protective thermally sprayed coatings on cylin- der bores include material combinations with solid lubricant ability. The used thermal spray processes are high-energetic (Atmospheric Plasma Spraying) and high-energetic hypersonic deposition meth- ods (High Velocity Oxygen Fuel Spraying). The knowledge of the mechanical and thermophysical properties of coatings is a key requirement for an optimized stable and repeatable manufacturing process as well as for reproducible high quality composites. 2001-01-3550. Cylinder bore finishes and their effect on oil consumption. Stephen H. Hill, Dana Corp. New emission requirements (PZEV and ULEV) have sparked interest in further improvement in engine oil consumption. This paper reviews measurement equipment and parameters currently used to describe bore finish, as well as recent research on bore finish effects on oil consumption. Typical bore finishes in use are bench- marked for a number of engines, and recommendations are pres- ented for future finishes. The paper closes with some case histories illustrating bore finish effects on oil consumption and current prob- lems in this area. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3552. Contribution of oil traction to diesel engine cam galling. Mandeep Saini and Frances E. Lockwood, The Valvo- line Co.; and Jerry C. Wang and Carl F. Musolff, Cummins, Inc. Heavy-duty diesel engines typically use roller followers in con- tact with the cam to reduce friction and accommodate high Hertzian stresses. When the rolling contact slips into sliding, cam galling can occur that may lead to major cam failures. Oil traction has been identified as a possible source to cause slipping. In this study, oil traction was first measured in a Mini Traction Machine (MTM). The results were then validated by a series of engine tests to show that the measured oil traction correlated with the occurrence of cam gall- ing. Finally, the MTM was used to evaluate various engine oil for- mulations. It is concluded that some advanced base oils, if not prop- erly compensated by the additive package, exhibit dangerously low oil traction. Oil traction needs to be part of the oil formulation considerations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3553. (SP-1638) The effect of valve lift shape and timing on air motion and mixture formation of DISI engines adopting different VVA actuators. S. Diana, B. Iorio, V. Giglio, and G. Police, Istituto Motori of National Research Council of Italy. A number of Variable Valve Actuators (VVA) has been recently proposed to improve the performances and the part load efficiency of spark ignition engines. Due to their peculiarity, these systems work with different strategies (late or early inlet valve closing, reduced lift, etc.). The shape and the timing of the valve lift affect not only the pumping losses, but also air motion inside the cylinder. That influ- ences mixture formation and combustion evolution of Direct Injec- tion Spark Ignition (DISI) engines. The present paper compares the performances of different VVA systems with the aid of a ID code for the simulation of the inlet and of the exhaust phases, and of a fluid-dynamic 3D code to evaluate mixing phenomena inside the cylinder. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3554. (SP-1638) Load control using late intake valve closing in a cross flow cylinder head. Fredrik Söderberg and Bengt Johansson, Lund Institute of Technology. A newly developed cross flow cylinder head has been used for comparison between throttled and unthrottled operation using late intake valve closing. Pressure measurements have been used for cal- culations of indicated load and heat-release. Emission measure- ments has also been made. A model was used for estimating the amount of residual gases resulting from the different load strategies. Unthrottled operation using late intake valve closing resulted in lower pumping losses, but also in increased amounts of residual gases, using this cylinder head. This is due to the special design, with one intake valve and one exhaust valve per camshaft. Late intake valve closing was achieved by phasing one of the camshafts, resulting in late exhaust valve closing as well. With very late phas- ing - i.e., low load - the effective compression ratio was reduced. 429</page><page sequence="429">2001-01-3554-2001-01-3562 This, in combination with high amount of residual gases, resulted in a very unstable combustion. The main combustion, 10-90% heat-release, was quite fast for all load control strategies, indicating high turbulence. This could not be seen in the early combustion, however. An increase in fuel conversion efficiency could be achieved with up to 9%. The emissions of NOx were reduced by 4-5 g/kWh with LIVC for loads between 4-8 bar IMEPnet. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3555. (SP-1638) Analysis of tumble and swirl motions in a four-valve SI engine. Yufeng Li , Hua Zhao , Zhijun Peng , and Nicos Ladommatos, Brunei Univ. Tumble and swirl motions in the cylinder of a four-valve SI engine with production-type cylinder head were investigated using a cross-correlation digital Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Tum- ble motion was measured on the vertical symmetric plane of the combustion chamber. Swirl motion was measured on a plane paral- lel to the piston crown with one of intake ports blocked. Large-scale flow behaviours and their cyclic variations were analysed from the measured two-dimensional velocity data. Results show that swirl motion is generated at the end of the intake stroke and persists to the end of the compression stroke. Tumble vortex is produced in the early stage of the compression stroke and distorted in the late stage of the stroke. The cyclic variation of swirl motion is noticeable. The cyclic variation in tumble dominated flow field is much greater. Dis- tribution of two-dimensional fluctuation kinetic energy field for swirl motion gradually becomes homogeneous in the late stage of the compression process, while for tumble motion the distribution of velocity fluctuation field is inhomogeneous during the whole compression stroke. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3556. (SP-1638) Flow, combustion and emissions in a five-valve research gasoline engine. N. Kampanis and C. Arcou- manis, City University London ; and R. Kato and S. Kometani, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. The in-cylinder flow, mixture distribution, combustion and exhaust emissions in a research, five-valve purpose-built gasoline engine are discussed on the basis of measurements obtained using laser doppler velocimetry (LDV), fast spark-plug hydrocarbon sam- pling, flame imaging and NOx/HC emissions using fast chemilumi- nescent and flame ionization detectors/ analyzers. These measure- ments have been complemented by steady flow testing of various cylinder head configurations, involving single- and three-valve operation, in terms of flow capacity and in-cylinder tumble strength. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3557. (SP-1638) Analysis of combustion behavior during cold-start and warm-up process of SI gasoline engine. Yon g Cheng, Jian-Xin Wang, Ren- J un Zhuang, and Ning Wu, Tsinghua Univ. Experiment is carried out on an engine dynamometer bench for simulating the cold-start of port-injected gasoline engines. Based on the measured temperatures and HC emissions at the inlet and outlet of the catalytic converter as well as cylinder pressure, how to achieve minimum catalytic-converter-out HC emissions prior to cat- alyst light-off has been discussed. In this experiment, the cold-start period is divided into three stages referred to the opening of the throttle valve. Most of the HC are emitted in the first stage, i.e., from cranking to the opening of the throttle valve. Retarding of spark tim- ing could cause incomplete combustion in the cylinder and lead to the oxidization of the unburned HC in the exhaust manifold, which results in reductions of tailpipe HC emissions. Incomplete combus- tion could also occur when throttle valve is open by setting proper spark timing. The combustion in the exhaust manifold would con- tribute to the reduction of HC emissions and quicken the light-off of the catalyst. 2001-01-3558. (SP-1638) The dynamic effect of residual gas temperature on combustion torque at idle. Richard Ford and Nick Collings, University of Cambridge. The amount of residual gas present in the cylinder has a well doc- umented effect on the combustion event at idle. The high levels of burnt gas present at low engine speed leads to significant cyclic vari- ability. This paper presents research which indicates that the temper- ature of the residual gas, which can vary from event to event depending on the spark timing, also has a significant effect on the combustion torque. The more the spark timing is retarded from MBT timing, the more thermal energy is present in the exhaust gas. The idle speed control strategy typically varies the spark to give fast torque actuation for good speed regulation and hence the tempera- ture of the residual gas may change significantly within the space of a few events. The paper shows evidence of the phenomenon (with fixed engine speed and air mass flow) and discusses possible causes. It then proceeds to develop a dynamic model for the behavior. Finally the model is used in a feedback idle speed controller to com- pensate for the torque abnormalities. The results of the compensa- tion technique are discussed and suggestions for further research are given. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3559. (SP-1638) Low-order map approximations of lean cyclic dispersion in premixed spark ignition engines. Robert M. Wagner, C. Stuart Daw, and Johney B. Green, Jr., Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We investigate lean-fueling cyclic dispersion in spark ignition engines in terms of experimental nonlinear mapping functions rep- resenting the connection between past and future combustion events. Nonlinear mapping functions provide a relatively easy method for identifying the deterministic dynamics associated with lean combustion instability, even in the presence of very high levels of noise. Observed experimental maps appear to have strong simi- larities to those predicted by an existing nonlinear spark ignition engine model. Differences between the observed map and model predictions become more pronounced at very lean fueling and high residual fraction. Map function details are shown to be useful in model validation, identifying model deficiencies, and comparing the characteristics of different engines. We expect that such maps will also be useful for developing real-time control strategies. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3561. (SP-1638) Analysis of degree of constant vol- ume and cooling loss in a hydrogen-fuelled SI engine. Toshio Shudo , Musashi Institute of Technology; and Shigeki Nabetani, Mit- subishi Motors Co. This study analyzes the factors influencing the thermal efficiency of a homogeneous charge spark-injection (SI) engine fuelled with hydrogen, focusing on the degree of constant volume and cooling loss. The cooling loss from the burning gas to the cylinder walls is quantitatively evaluated by analyzing the cylinder pressure diagram and exhaust gas composition. The degree of constant volume burn- ing and constant volume cooling are also obtained by fitting the Wiebe function to the rate of heat release calculated using the cylin- der pressure diagram. A comparison of combustion and cooling characteristics of hydrogen and methane combustion reveals that cooling loss in hydrogen combustion is higher than that of methane combustion due to the short quenching distance and rapid burning velocity during hydrogen combustion. It is also suggested that the high cooling loss observed during hydrogen combustion reduces thermal efficiency. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3562. (SP-1638) An experimental study of knock in a natural gas-fuelled spark ignition engine. G. Brecq, A. Ramesh, M. Tazerout, and O. Le Corre, Ecole Des Mines De Nantes. Experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder SI engine fuelled by natural gas. Equivalence ratios varying from 0.7 to 1.0 were used and the spark timing was changed from no knock to high 430</page><page sequence="430">2001-01-3562-2001-01-3568 knock conditions. Pressure crank angle data from 160 consecutive cycles was analyzed. It was found that coefficient of variation of peak pressure (COVPP) and standard deviation of the angle of occurrence of peak pressure (SDAPP) can be used to set the engine for knock-free operation. These parameters show a sudden rise from a minimum value that they attain near a spark timing where knock sets in. When the average knock intensity is low, there are two groups of cycles. The first comprises of non-knocking to slightly knocking ones. The other contains cycles with relatively high knock intensity. The sudden emergence of two groups is responsible for the observed trends of SDAPP. At high overall knock intensities the first group is absent. A threshold value could be fixed for the maxi- mum rate of pressure rise to indicate the onset of knock. It was not possible to detect the onset of knock from cyclic variations in the IMEP or maximum rate of pressure rise. 2001-01-3563. (SP-1638) Experiment and numerical simula- tion of unsteady temperature fields in automotive catalytic con- verters. Jian-Xin Wang , Shi-Jin Shuai, and Ren-Jun Zhuang, Tsinghua Univ. This paper measured unsteady temperature fields of uncoated- monolith and catalytic monolith under real engine operating condi- tions using thermocouples. A multi-dimensional flow mathematical model of the turbulence, heat and mass transfer, and chemical reac- tions in monoliths was established using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code and numerically solved in the whole flow field of the catalytic converter. The purpose of this paper is to study unsteady warm-up characteristics of the monoliths and to investi- gate effects of inlet cone structure on temperature distribution of the catalytic converter. Experimental results show that the warm-up behaviors between uncoated monolith and catalytic monolith are quite different. Simulation results indicate that the established model can qualitatively predict the warm-up characteristics. Increas- ing the inlet cone angle can improve the light-off characteristics of the catalysts due to high flow velocity and high temperature in the center of the monoliths. 2001-01-3564. (SP-1638) Effects of intake valve closing timing on gasoline engine performance and emissions. Liguang Li, Jianwu Tao, Yunkai Wang, and Yan Su, Jilin Univ.; and Min Xiao, Changchun Automobile Research Institute. This paper presents a study of the influence of intake valve clos- ing (IVC) timing on the performance of the high-speed spark igni- tion (SI) engine, such as the output of torque and power, fuel con- sumption and emissions. An electrically controlled Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system based on the variable working position belt extender was developed and its pro-type was successfully set up in a 5-valve, double overhead cam (DOHC) SI engine. Test results showed that the IVC timing plays an important role in increasing the power output, decreasing the fuel consumption and CO and HC emissions under both high- and low-speed conditions as compared to the fixed IVC timing. The control of intake valve closing timing is a simple and effective means to improve engine's performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3565. (SP- 1639) Hydrocarbon reactivity in a plasma- catalyst system: Thermal versus plasma-assisted lean NOx reduction. Steven J. Schmieg, Byong K. Cho, and Se H. Oh, General Motors Corp. The steady-state reduction of NOx at temperatures between 150- 300°C has been investigated under simulated lean-burn conditions using a two-stage transient flow reactor system consisting of non- thermal plasma in combination with a sodium Y zeolite catalyst. Reactivity comparisons were made with and without plasma opera- tion in order to identify the plasma-generated hydrocarbon species necessary for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx. With propene as the hydrocarbon in the feed, NO is completely oxidized to NO2 in the plasma and the formation of oxidized carbon- containing species include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methanol. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements indicate a close carbon balance between plasma inlet and outlet gas feed concentrations, signifying the major species have been identified. Plasma-assisted NOx conversion over the sodium Y zeolite cata- lyst is improved with supplemental acetaldehyde injection, primar- ily through the removal of NO from the feed stream. In addition, the thermal (no plasma) reduction of NO is much greater with acetalde- hyde as the reductant compared to propene, demonstrating that the NOx reduction reaction is controlled by the acetaldehyde present in the gas feed. The thermal catalytic NOx conversion with acetalde- hyde in a NO-containing feed is much higher than that in a N02-containing feed, indicating that plasma conversion of NO to NO2 is not required for NOx reduction. The higher activity of NO is due to the increased formation of HCN, a partial reduction product that can be removed using a downstream Pt/Al203 catalyst. Octane, which is more representative of hydrocarbons found in diesel fuel/ exhaust, forms acetaldehyde over the catalyst and yields comparable NOx reduction activity. At similar acetaldehyde concentration levels entering the catalyst, thermal NOx conversion with the feed contain- ing NO and acetaldehyde is comparable to the plasma-assisted NOx conversion efficiency with the feed containing propene and NO, suggesting that an appropriate hydrocarbon can reduce NO without the use of non-thermal plasma. 2001-01-3567. (SP- 1639) Plasma-enhanced adsorption and reduction on lean NOx catalysts. Thomas Hammer and Tetsuo Kishimoto, Siemens AG; Bernd Krutzsch, DaimlerChrysler AG; and Renato Andorf and Carsten Pio g, DaimlerChrysler AG, Forschung und Technologie Dornier GmbH. The influence of adsorption and desorption processes on the non- thermal plasma enhanced catalytic reduction of NOx on NaZSM5- and AhCh-based lean-NOx catalysts (Pt-NH4ZSM5, Cu-NaZSM5, Fe-NaZSM5, Pt-Al203, Pd-Al203, Cu0-A1203, Ag-Al203) was investigated by temperature programmed reaction experiments in the temperature range from 100°C to 600°C. Dodecane was used as a reducing agent. Strong HC adsorption- and desorption effects were observed on the zeolite catalysts, which were not influenced by plas- ma-pretreatment. Adsorption of NO2 and desorption of NO occurred on Al203-based catalysts. By plasma-pretreatment adsorption of NO2 was induced at low temperatures. NOx-reduction rates of the catalysts Cu-NaZSM5, Fe-NaZSM5, and the Ag-Al203 were increased substantially by plasma-pretreatment. Both plasma- induced and catalytic oxidation of HCs were limiting factors of the NOx-reduction obtained on these catalysts. 2001-01-3568. (SP- 1639) The role of NO selective catalysts in the plasma-enhanced removal of NOx and PM from diesel exhausts. Suzanne E. Thomas, James T. Shawcross, Robert Gilles- pie, David Raybone, and Anthony R. Martin, Accentus pic. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) systems are attracting increasing interest as candidates for future generation diesel exhaust aftertreat- ment technologies. Strategies are being investigated for lean NOx reduction, particulate (PM) oxidation and for combined NOx and PM aftertreatment. One approach for plasma-catalyst NOx reduc- tion is to convert NO to NO2 with a plasma and then reduce the NO2 over a suitable catalyst. However, it has been recently suggested that particulate in the diesel exhaust may inhibit the NTP conversion of NO into NO2 in a plasma regenerating diesel particulate filter (DPF). In addition some NO2 selective catalysts are demonstrating high levels of N2O production rather than being selective to N2. It has been suggested that combined NOx and PM removal could be achieved by employing an NO selective reduction catalyst in combi- nation with a plasma DPF. Silver-doped alumina (Ag-Al203) is shown to be a particularly effective catalyst for NO reduction. Combination of this catalyst with a plasma resulted in the NOx reduction being enhanced. This effect is especially pronounced at lower exhaust temperatures char- acteristic of passenger car exhausts. It was found that the plasma cat- 431</page><page sequence="431">2001-01-3568-2001-01-3573 alyst enhancement was effective with both propene and diesel fuel acting as a reductant. Studies appear to show a link between plasma-enhanced NO reduction and the generation of active species such as formaldehyde (CH2O). It appears that the composition of the reductant mixture in the exhaust stream plays a fundamental role in the plasma catalyst "mechanism that enhances NO reduction. The combination of this catalyst and plasma would support the proposed PM / NOx removal strategy. 2001-01-3569. (SP- 1639) Lean-NOx and plasma catalysis over y-alumina for heavy-duty diesel applications. Paul W. Park Jill E. Rockwood, Carne L. Boyer, Christie S. Ragle, and M. Lou Bal - mer-Millar, Caterpillar Inc.; and Christopher L. Aardahl, Craig F. Habeger, Kenneth G. Rappé, and Diana N. Tran, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The NOx reduction performance under lean conditions over y-alumina was evaluated using a micro-reactor system and a non- thermal plasma-equipped bench test system. Various alumina sam- ples were obtained from alumina manufacturers to assess commer- cial alumina materials. In addition, y-alumina samples were synthe- sized at Caterpillar with a solgel technique in order to control alu- mina properties. The deNOx performances of the alumina samples were compared. The alumina samples were characterized with ana- lytical techniques such as inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emis- sion spectroscopy, temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and surface area measurements (BET) to understand physical and chem- ical properties. The information derived from these techniques was correlated with the NOx reduction performance to identify key parameters of y-alumina for optimizing materials for lean-NOx and plasma assisted catalysis. 2001-01-3570. (SP- 1639) Plasma-facilitated SCR of NOx in heavy-duty diesel exhaust. K. G. Rappé, C. L. Aardahl, C. F. Habeger, D. N. Tran, M. A. Delgado, and L.-Q. Wang, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; and P. W. Park, and M. L. Balmer, Caterpillar Inc. This paper describes two independent studies on y-alumina as a plasma-activated catalyst, y-alumina (2.5 - 4.3 wt%) was coated onto the surface of mesoporous silica to determine the importance of aluminum surface coordination on NOx conversion in conjunc- tion with nonthermal plasma. Results indicate that the presence of 5- and 6-fold aluminum coordination sites in y-alumina could be a significant factor in the NOx reduction process. A second study examined the effect of changing the reducing agent on NOx conver- sion. Several hydrocarbons were examined including propene, pro- pane, isooctane, methanol, and acetaldehyde. It is demonstrated that methanol was the most effective reducing agent of those tested for a plasma-facilitated reaction over y-alumina. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3571. (SP- 1639) Characterization of acid sites in ion- exchanged and soiid-state-exchanged zeolites. A. C. Ebeling, A. G. Panov, D. E. McCready, and M. L. Balmer, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Br0nsted acidity of solution ion-exchanged and solid-state- exchanged zeolites was compared for NaY, BaY, CaY, NaX, and CaX zeolites. These materials were chosen because they all exhibit catalytic activity in SCR of NOx in combination with a non-thermal plasma. Br0nsted acidity was characterized qualitatively with retinol as an indicator dye. Our results show that the solid-state exchange using a chloride salt creates zeolites with lower acidity than zeolites obtained by conventional solution ion-exchange. NO2 adsorption was also found to create a significant quantity of acid sites at room temperature and a slight increase in acidity at 200°C. We speculate that the acid sites created by NO2 adsorption, because of their vicin- ity to metal cation sites in the zeolite, may lead to preferential reac- tions that lead to NOx reduction. BaY made by solution ion- exchange and BaY made by solid-state exchange using a chloride salt were tested for NOx reduction in a plasma-catalyst reactor sys- tem. Both catalysts showed similar catalytic activity. BaY prepared by solid-state exchange shows no coking due to absence of acid sites. In contrast, the BaY material prepared by conventional solu- tion ion-exchange shows significant coke formation. Thus, the solid state exchanged BaY is a potentially more stable catalyst. 2001-01-3572. Detailed characterization of morphology and dimensions of diesel particulates via thermophoretic sampling. Kyeong Ook Lee, Roger Cole, and Raj Sekar, Argonne National Laboratory ; Mun Young Choi, Drexel University ; Jinyu Zhu, Uni- versity of Illinois at Chicago; and Jinsuk Kang, and Choongsik Bae, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. A thermophoretic particulate sampling device was used to inves- tigate the detailed morphology and microstructure of diesel particu- lates at various engine-operating conditions. A 75 HP Caterpillar single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine was operated to sam- ple particulate matter from the high-temperature exhaust stream. The morphology and microstructure of the collected diesel particu- lates were analyzed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope and subsequent image processing/data acquisition sys- tem. The analysis revealed that spherical primary particles were agglomerated together to form large aggregate clusters for most of engine speed and load conditions. Measured primary particle sizes ranged from 34.4 to 28.5 nm at various engine-operating conditions. The smaller primary particles observed at high engine-operating conditions were believed to be caused by particle oxidation at the high combustion temperature. A number of small and irregularly shaped particles were captured at these conditions. Graphitic struc- tures were observed for the soot sampled at the high engine- operating conditions, while other samples from the lower engine- operating conditions displayed mostly amorphous structures. Analy- ses for fractal geometry of soot agglomerates suggested that the dif- fusion-limited particulate growth mechanism, by which chain-like particle clusters form, is predominant. 2001-01-3573. Characterization of diesel particulate emis- sions in heavy-duty DI diesel engines with common-rail fuel injection - Influence of injection parameters and fuel composi- tion. Andrea Bertola and Raffael Schubiger, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ; Adelheid Kasper, University of Applied Sciences Aargau; Ulrich Matter, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology; Anna Maria Forss and Martin Mohr, Swiss Federal Laboratories of Materials; and Konstantinos Boulouchos and Thomas Lutz, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The findings presented in this paper result from a collaboration between two Federal Laboratories in Switzerland. In this research project the characteristics of the particulates from internal combus- tion engines were investigated in detail. Measurements were carried out on a single-cylinder research engine focusing on exhaust partic- ulate matter emissions. The single-cylinder diesel engine is super- charged and features a common-rail direct injection system. This work analyzes the influence of fuel properties and injection parameters on the particulate number size distribution. For die fuel composition, five different fuels including low-sulfur diesel, zero- sulfur and zero-aromatics diesel, two blending portions of oxygen- ated diesel additive and rapeseed-methylester were used. For the injection parameters the injection pressure, the start of injection and the fuel amount in the pilot- and in the post-injection phases were varied. The engine tests were run at different operating points of the engine map and the exhaust gas recirculation rate was widely varied. For Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Photoelectric Aerosol Sensor (PAS) and Diffusion Charging Particle Sensor (DC) measurements, the sample taken from the exhaust gas line has been immediately diluted with a rotating diluter. The SMPS data of each experiment were collected twice: the exhaust gas being heated at a temperature of 350°C with a thermodesorber placed before the SMPS or bypassed without conditioning. Gravimetric and coulo- metric measurements were conducted using a partial flow diluter. 432</page><page sequence="432">2001-01-3573-2001-01-3578 To our knowledge, this is the first study that yields such detailed results on both the influence of several injection parameters and fuel properties in the same heavy-duty diesel engine on the basis of the same measurement techniques. The interpretation of the results is based on heat release rate and engine combustion process analysis, in order to identify important relationships between combustion modes and particulate formation. The results indicate that: - The injection parameter settings have the predominant role in the shape of the particulate matter size dis- tribution. The total particle number detected in the exhaust gas is very sensitive to the variation of the injection pressure; At very high injection pressures, a nucleation mode appears in the particle num- ber size distribution; Post-injection lowers the particle number con- centration in a significant way; Exhaust gas recirculation (cooled EGR) shifts the maximum in the number size distribution to more and larger particles; During the engine operation with Rapeseed- methylester, an unexpected large amount of ultrafine particles were detected in the exhaust (the mode of the particulate matter size dis- tribution is under 20nm diameter); In most cases there is a clear cor- relation between the integrated particle number concentration over the entire measurement range and the exhaust gas opacity. The plausibility of these trends is confirmed by the analysis of the combustion process. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3574. Qualitative laser-induced incandescence mea- surements of particulate emissions during transient operation of a TDI diesel engine. Boman Axelsson, Lund Institute of Technol- ogy ; and Peter O. Witze, Sandia National Laboratories. Laser-induced incandescence (LII) is a sensitive diagnostic tech- nique capable of making exhaust particulate-matter measurements during transient operating conditions. This paper presents measure- ments of LII signals obtained from the exhaust gas of a 1.9-L TDI diesel en-gine. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) is used in fixed-size mode to obtain simultaneous number con-centration measurements in real-time. The transient studies presented include a cranking-start/ idle/ shutdown sequence, on/off cycling of EGR, and rapid load changes. The results show superior temporal response of LII compared to the SMPS. Additional advantages of LII are that exhaust dilution and cooling are not required, and that the signal amplitude is directly proportional to the carbon volume fraction and its tempo-ral decay is related to the primary particle size. 2001-01-3575. Evaluation of methods for determining contin- uous particulate matter from transient testing of heavy-duty diesel engines. Ronald P. Jarrett and Nigel N. Clark, West Virginia Univ. The historical lack of continuous data for PM emissions from heavy-duty diesel engines hampers advanced inventory approaches and hampers second-by-second engine control optimization. Con- tinuos PM data can be obtained using a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM), but moisture correction of data is needed to remove unwanted transient components of the mass. Reasonable correlation can be found between TEOM data integrated over the cycle and conventional PM filter data. Considerable scatter was evi- dent when continuous TEOM data were plotted against instanta- neous power, but by dispersing the power in time a clearer relation- ship was evident. Continuous TEOM data showed the same gross trends as PM filter mass distributed over a cycle in proportion to instantaneous CO, but it was evident that this CO proportioning technique is at best approximate. Binning of PM mass rate as a func- tion of vehicle speed and acceleration were also evaluated for inven- tory purposes. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3576. Examination of particle size distribution of homogeneous and conventional diesel combustion. Thorsten Raatz and Eckart Mueller, Technical University Of Braunschweig. This paper reports an investigation of the particle size distribu- tion of different homogeneous diesel combustion systems in com- parison to conventional diffusion-controlled combustion system. The influence of different operating parameters such as load or degree of homogeneity on the number of particles and the particle size distribution, determined with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, is pointed out. The homogeneous combustion of diesel fuel possesses a large potential concerning NOx, soot and particle mass, but still a high number of nanoparticles is discharged. Additional experiments are reported, which were carried out to understand the high emission of nanoparticles at low soot combus- tion better and to determine the chemical composition of the nanoparticles. 2001-01-3577. DETR/SMMT/CONCAWE Particulate Research Program: Light-duty results. Jon D. Andersson and Barbara G. A. Wedekind, Ricardo Consulting Engineers; Diane Hall, CONCAWE, BP; Richard Stradling, CONCAWE, Shell ; and Geoff Wilson, SMMT, Land Rover. The DETR/SMMT/CONCAWE Particulate Research Program was designed to investigate the effects of vehicle/engine technology level, fuel specification and various operating conditions on emis- sions of particle mass, number and size. Results from the heavy-duty part of the program and details of the measuring protocols have already been published. This paper gives the results of the light-duty study. This consisted of six vehicles and eight fuels covering gaso- line, Diesel and LPG technologies. These six vehicles represented Euro II (1996) and Euro III (2000) technologies. Diesel fuels included EN590 (1996), EN590 (2000), UK ultra-low-sulphur diesel (UK ULSD) and Swedish Class I die- sel, while gasoline fuels comprised EN228 (1996), EN228 (1999) and UK ultra-low-sulphur gasoline (UK ULSG). Particle mass measurements were undertaken via the regulated method while the mass weighted size distribution was determined with a Micro Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI) covering a size range from &lt;56nm to 10pm. Particle number measurements and number-size distributions were performed with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). In addition to the particulate mass, the other regulated emissions were measured on a mass basis. Chemical analysis of selected particulate samples was also per- formed. This paper concludes that in general, when viewing conventional diesel, gasoline direct injection (G-DI), multipoint injection gaso- line (MPI) and particulate filter equipped diesel vehicles (DPF) together, vehicle technology effects were observed to be larger than fuel effects for total particle number. Total particle number was sub- divided into nucleation mode particles (nominated in this study as particles &lt;50nm) and accumulation mode particles (&gt;50nm). Obser- vations concerning the accumulation mode particle numbers reflect those made for particulate mass. Overall, integrated particle number emissions levels were gener- ally highest from the conventional diesel technologies, lower from the gasoline direct injection and lowest from the MPI gasoline and DPF-equipped diesel vehicles. However, particle size distributions and mass emissions differed greatly. Some fuel effects were also identified in specific vehicle technologies, but these were relatively small. 2001-01-3578. Monitoring of PM-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from diesel vehicles by photoelectric aerosol sen- sor (PAS). Shida Tang, Robert Johnson, Thomas Lanni, and Wil- liam Webster, New York State Department of Environmental Con- servation. In addition to the required measurement of particulate matter (PM) mass emission, characterization (chemical composition, sur- face area, size and number distributions) of diesel PM is becoming increasingly important and may impact future PM emission regula- tions. This is especially the case for PM-bound polycyclic aromatic 433</page><page sequence="433">2001-01-3578-2001-01-3583 hydrocarbons (PAHs), an organic class that includes many potential mutagenic and carcinogenic species. In this study, we have evalu- ated a sensor technique, photoelectric aerosol sensor (PAS), for the possibility of continuous monitoring of PM-bound PAHs. Evalua- tion of PAS is performed with heavy-duty diesel vehicles (trucks and buses) tested on a dynamometer with various transient driving • schedules. Comparison study between PAS and standard chemical analysis of PAHs is also performed for a limited number of diesel and CNG buses. Validation of PAS has been carried out by analyz- ing the diesel particulate standard reference material SRM 1650a with certified PAHs values from National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST). 2001-01-3579. A new type partial flow dilution tunnel with geometrical partitioning for diesel particulate measurement. Matsuo Odaka, Yuichi Goto, and Yujiro Tsukamoto, National Traf- fic Safety and Environment Laboratory ; and Mitsunobu Sekiya, Yoshihiro Yoshimura, and Tadashi Ikeda, Ono Sokki Co. Ltd. The authors have developed a new partial flow dilution tunnel (hereafter referred to as PPFT), whose principal device is a flux splitting gas divider, as a new means of measuring particulate emis- sions which can be applied to transient cycle testing of diesel engines. The advantage of this system is that it can achieve perfect constant velocity splitting by means of its structure, and theoreti- cally can also maintain high splitting performance despite fluctua- tions in the exhaust flow rate, including those due to engine exhaust pulsation. We compared this system with a full tunnel by analyzing the basic performance of the system and measuring particulate mat- ter (PM) using an actual vehicle engine. The results obtained from measuring the relative flow rates of exhaust gas show that combining the gas divider with a turbulence reduction screen generates a flow rate distribution with axial sym- metry and gives splitting performance with a high degree of correla- tion (regression line within y = 1.0017x-0.1975, coefficient of corre- lation &gt;0.9990) in any of three test cycles: D 13, FTP, or ETC. In addition, a comparison of the total mass of gaseous emission com- ponents based on the results of measurements on the raw gas and gas with the emissions diluted by the PPFT demonstrated that even integral values of the gaseous emissions are accurately divided, and that the system has a high degree of repeatability even for transient cycle mode operation. In comparison with the full tunnel, the maximum deviation in the PM mass rate in steady-state operation was no greater than 12%, and an overall correlation coefficient of 0.9799 was obtained. The aver- age of four PM mass rate measurements was within 2% for all three test modes -D13, FTP, and ETC-and the maximum percentage devi- ation was within 5%. This means that the PPFT has equivalent char- acteristics to a full tunnel, and the same high level of repeatability as with a full tunnel was obtained. 2001-01-3580. PM measurement with partial dilution tunnel - Influence of sampling line on PM measurement. Yuichi Goto and Yujiro Tsukamoto, National Traffic Safety and Environ- ment Laboratory. The full-flow dilution tunnel (hereinafter referred to as full tun- nel) measurement method has become the de facto standard for the evaluation of particulate matter (hereinafter referred to as PM) emit- ted from diesel-powered vehicles. However, due to its drawbacks such as bulkiness and expensiveness, a method that uses a very small partial dilution tunnel (hereinafter referred to as micro tunnel) has been developed, mainly in Europe, nearly to the level of practi- cality. With this method, a higher degree of freedom in controlling sampling flow and temperature can be obtained. Another advantage of the micro tunnel is that the system is compact. However, the micro tunnel's measurement accuracy remains uncertain because the accumulation of measurement data is not yet sufficient. Measuring PM while varying micro tunnel operating parameters permitted a check on the equivalency with a full tunnel system. Although no errors were found in sampling flow rate and dilution ratio control, the resulting PM measurements were observed with some bias errors. This tendency has also been reported by researchers in many other laboratories. The cause is speculated to be the longer sampling line of the micro tunnel in proportion to the tunnel itself and the impact of temperature control on the composi- tion of PM. On this basis, a sampling line system was modified for further measurement. The influence of the sampling line system on equivalency to full tunnel results was shown very clearly from the measurements and analysis. 2001-01-3581. Transient particulate matter measurements from the exhaust of a direct injection spark ignition automobile. Gregory J. Smallwood, David R. Snelling, Omer L. Giilder, Dan Clavel, Daniel Gareau, and Robert A. Sawchuk, National Research Council Canada; and Lisa Graham, Environment Canada. Diesel and gasoline engines face tightening particulate matter emissions regulations due to the environmental and health effects attributed to these emissions. There is increasing demand for mea- suring not only the concentration, but also the size distribution of the particulates. Laser-induced incandescence has emerged as a promising technique for measuring spatially and temporally resolved soot volume fraction and size. Laser-induced incandes- cence has orders of magnitude more sensitive than the gravimetric technique, and thus offers the promise of real-time measurements and adds information on the increasingly desirable size and mor- phology information. Quantitative LII is shown to provide a sensi- tive, precise, and repeatable measure of the soot concentration over a wide measurement range. The current research determined the tailpipe particulate emis- sions characteristics from a DISI (direct injection spark ignition) vehicle, including identifying the relative contributions of various engine modes to the total particulate emissions. The volume concen- tration measurements were obtained in the undilute exhaust with laser-induced incandescence (LII). Particulate measurements were also performed with ELPI instrumentation, sampling from a mini- diluter. Gravimetric filter sampling was performed to measure mass emission rate, organic/elemental carbon, and sulphates/nitrates/trace elements. The LII technique was demonstrated to be capable of real-time particulate matter measurements over all vehicle transient condi- tions. The wide measurement range and lower detection limit of LII make it a potentially preferred standard instrument for soot measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3582. (SP-1645) The effect of ethanol on gasoline oxi- dation stability. Claudia Veronica D'Ornellas, PETROBRAS. The motor gasoline on which Brazilian vehicles run is in fact a 'gasohol' composed of gasoline and a variable amount of 19 to 25% volume of anhydrous ethanol. The oxidation of the hydrocarbon portion of this mixture is accelerated by the presence of oxygen, light and temperature, but its speed is primarily dependent on its composition. This paper examines the ethanol effect on gasoline oxidation stability, based on experimental work carried out in PETROBRAS laboratories to evaluate gasolines with and without ethanol. The chemical composition of the collected samples were analyzed by GC/MS for hydrocarbon types (PIANO), sulfur and nitrogen content by X-ray fluorescence and other properties. The effect of the oxygenate on gasoline stability was evaluated by mea- suring the washed gum, color degradation and insolubles formed during aging up to 24 weeks at ambient temperature (Rio de Janeiro, 13 to 41°C, average 25°C) and 43°C, as well as by the 4-hour poten- tial gum test. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3583. (SP-1645) Gasoline type and engine effects on equilibrium combustion chamber deposits (CCD). S. R. Kelemen, M. Siskin, N. L. Avery, and K. D. Rose, ExxonMobil Research and 434</page><page sequence="434">2001-01-3583-2001-01-3588 Engineering Co.; and M. Solum , and R. J. Pugmire, University of Utah. The behavior of equilibrium combustion chamber deposits (CCDs) was examined in Honda generator engines. The initial rapid CCD build-up was followed by a slower period of growth until an equilibrium level was reached after about 240 hours. The chemical composition of these CCDs follow the same compositional trends originally established for a range of vehicle CCDs produced up to 20,000 miles. The mean CCD thickness was related to the total CCD weight obtained from end of test samples. Differences were found in the equilibrium CCD thicknesses among base fuel and gasoline additives. The range of the mean CCD thickness was 155 microns to 240 microns. Three different experimental additives gave equilib- rium CCD thickness that were 2% below, 1% above and 22% above the corresponding base fuel. The mean equilibrium CCD thickness for a commercial additive package was 8% above the corresponding base fuel. Analyses of equilibrium CCD thickness changes at indi- vidual sampling locations identified active regions on the piston tops near the cylinder wall and by the exhaust valve near the cylinder wall. Another active region is on the cylinder head near the spark plug. Other selected regions gave individual point thickness changes comparable to calibration measurements. Mean individual point CCD thickness changes with base fuel and with a commercial addi- tive package were not significantly different. This work demon- strates that it is possible to quantify equilibrium CCD performance differences for gasoline by utilizing CCD thickness measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3584. (SP- 1645) Fuel anti-knock quality - Part I. Engine studies. G. T. Kalghatgi, Shell Global Solutions. This is the first part of a two-part study on how to define the anti- knock quality of practical fuels. Knock intensity is measured in two single-cylinder research engines using different fuels at different mixture strengths, throttle settings and two compression ratios. The anti-knock quality of a fuel in a given engine operating condition is defined by its octane index Ol = RON - KS where K is a constant for that condition and S is the sensitivity, (RON-MON), and RON and MON are the Research and Motor Octane numbers respectively. The higher the octane index, the better the anti-knock quality of the fuel. K is often assumed to be 0.5 so that OI=(RON+MON)/2. How- ever, it is found that K depends on engine operating conditions and in some cases, K is negative so that for a given RON, a fuel with higher sensitivity (lower MON) has better anti-knock quality. The value of K decreases as the engine becomes more prone to knock, i.e., as its octane requirement increases. In terms of the end-gas properties, K decreases as the temperature decreases for a given pressure. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3585. (SP- 1645) Fuel anti-knock quality - Part II. Vehicle studies - How relevant is motor octane number (MON) in modern engines? G. T. Kalghatgi , Shell Global Solutions. The effect of fuel anti-knock quality on power and acceleration performance is studied in twenty-three European and Japanese cars equipped with knock sensors. The anti-knock quality of a fuel in a given car and operating condition is defined by its octane index OI = RON - KS where K is a constant for that condition and S is the sensitivity, (RON-MON), and RON and MON are the Research and Motor Octane numbers respectively. The higher the octane index, the better the anti-knock quality of the fuel and the better the power and acceleration performance. K is often assumed to be 0.5 so that OI = (RON+MON)/2. However, it is found that in most cases con- sidered here, K is negative so that for a given RON, a fuel with higher sensitivity (lower MON) has better anti-knock quality and better performance. Even when K is not negative it has a small (&lt; 0.2) positive value so that MON contributes much less to fuel anti- knock quality than generally assumed. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3586. (SP- 1645) Thermochemical behavior of pro- ducer gas from gasification of lignocellulosic biomass in SI engines. Magin Lapuerta and Juan José Hern ndez, University of Castilla-La Mancha; and Francisco V. Tinaut and Alfonso Horrillo, University of Valladolid. A study about the utilization of producer gas from gasifiers for obtaining mechanical energy in a SI engine is presented in this work. Therefore, the influence of the gas composition and its thermody- namic properties on the combustion characteristics and on the engine performance are analyzed. A home-made chemical equilib- rium model which considers 28 chemical species was used to calcu- late the gas composition as a function of the gasification conditions, and to study the influence of the gas composition on some thermo- chemical parameters such as adiabatic flame temperature and heat release. The chemical kinetic package CHEMKIN III was also used to study its autoignition behavior. Finally, a quasi-dimensional two- zone model for SI engines was used to calculate the knock tendency and to analyze the effect of fuel composition on some combustion parameters related to engine performance (IMEP, cylinder pressure, etc.). The comparison with the results obtained from some conven- tional fuels permits the evaluation of the potential of this technology with respect to conventional technologies and to propose modifica- tions from the engine design, to take advantages of the different fuel characteristics. 2001-01-3587. (SP- 1645) Contribution of liquid fuel to hydro- carbon emissions in spark ignition engines. Gary B. Landsberg , John B. Heywoody and Wai K. Cheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The purpose of this work was to develop an understanding of how liquid fuel transported into the cylinder of a port-fuel-injected gasoline-fueled SI engine contributes to hydrocarbon (HC) emis- sions. To simulate the liquid fuel flow from the valve seat region into the cylinder, a specially designed fuel probe was developed and used to inject controlled amounts of liquid fuel onto the port wall close to the valve seat. By operating the engine on pre-vaporized Indolene, and injecting a small amount of liquid fuel close to the valve seat while the intake valve was open, we examined the effects of liquid fuel entering the cylinder at different circumferential loca- tions around the valve seat. Similar experiments were also carried out with closed valve injection of liquid fuel at the valve seat to assess the effects of residual blowback, and of evaporation from the intake valve and port surfaces. The amount and location of liquid fuel entering the cylinder was found to have a significant impact on engine-out hydrocarbon emis- sions. Around the intake valve seat periphery, liquid fuel delivered closest to the exhaust valve resulted in the highest engine-out HC's, while delivery farthest from the exhaust valve had the lowest HC's. Closed valve (CV) probe liquid fuel injection resulted in lower engine-out HC emissions than did the same amount of liquid fuel with open-valve (OV) injection. This difference between OV and CV probe fuel injection was about equal in magnitude for all probe locations, indicating that the blowback during valve overlap has a similar impact on fuel redistribution and vaporization at all circum- ferential locations. Overall, liquid fuel flow into the cylinder pro- duces 3 to 7 times more HC emissions per unit mass of fuel than does vapor fuel flow, depending of flow location. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3588. (SP- 1645) No major backsliding in air quality when replacing MTBE with isooctane in CARB gasoline. Johan Perander, Leena Rantanen, and Juha Pentikäinen, Fortum Oil and Gas Oy; and Päivi Aakko, and Anu Jäntti, Technical Research Cen- tre of Finland. Plans to ban MTBE (Methyl tertiary-Butyl Ether) have led to dis- cussions on how the gasoline in California will be formulated with- out any backsliding in air quality. One possibility is to replace MTBE with isooctane. 435</page><page sequence="435">200 1-01 -3588 - 200 1-01 -3595 Exhaust emissions using California Phase II gasoline with MTBE, were compared to a gasoline where MTBE had been replaced with isooctane. Regulated, particulate, carbon dioxide, and PAH (polyaromatic hydrocarbons) emissions were measured at 22°C temperature for 8 vehicles using the European cycle for year 2000 (ECE+EUDC). One of the vehicles was a GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection), one was a carbureted model without a catalytic converter, and the others were equipped with multi point fuel injec- tion and catalytic converters. Results indicate that no major backsliding in air quality can be expected when replacing MTBE with isooctane. NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions were reduced in all vehicle types. CO emissions increased in the vehicle without a catalytic converter. Differences in fuel consumption and C02-emissions were within the accuracy of the measurements. Consistent differences were not seen between the fuels concerning PAH emissions or particulate mutagenicity. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3589. (SP- 1645) Hybrid fuel technique for CO2 reduction in SI engines. Ken-ichi Okamoto, Tadahide Sone, Ken- ichiro Saitoh , and Koji Oyama, Nippon Mitsubishi Oil Corp. This paper describes a new hybrid fuel technique for improving the thermal efficiency and fuel economy of SI engines. A new type of fuel additive that has friction modification effects was evaluated. By treating gasoline with this additive, a fuel economy benefit of up to 2.4%, which means a 2.4% reduction in carbon dioxide emis- sions from vehicles, has been attained in a modified Japanese 10-15 mode test. Improvements in the engine power and vehicle accelera- tion were also observed due to application of this technique. No- harm tests were also conducted, and it was found that this technique exhibited no significant harmful side effects in the tests conducted in this program. 2001-01-3590.

Kohtaro Hashimoto , Masashi Taniguchi , Mitsuru Arai , and Masamitsu Tamura, Univer- sity of Tokyo. In order to clarify the effects of fuel properties on the mixture formation under the stratified-charge combustion condition in a direct-injection gasoline engine, fuel concentration measurement in the vicinity of the ignition plug was established using a fast response flame ionization detector (FID). A single-cylinder direct-injection gasoline engine, for which a Toyota D-4 engine was modified, was used. Paraffin, olefin, naphthene and ether having a boiling point of approximately 50°C, and paraffin, olefin and an aromatic compound having a boiling point of approximately 100°C were used as candi- date fuels. As a result, the effect of boiling point on the mixture for- mation was clarified. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3591. (SP-1645) Fuel economy benefit of cylinder deactivation - Sensitivity to vehicle application and operating constraints. T. G. Leone and M. Pozar , Ford Motor Co. A Variable Displacement Engine (VDE) improves fuel economy by deactivating half the cylinders at light load. The actual fuel econ- omy benefit attained in the vehicle depends on how often cylinders can be deactivated, which is a function of test cycle, engine size, and vehicle weight. In practice, cylinder deactivation will also be con- strained by NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness). This paper presents fuel economy projections for VDE in several different engine and vehicle applications. Sensitivity to NVH con- siderations is quantified by calculating fuel economy with and with- out cylinder deactivation in various operating modes: idle, low engine speed, 1st and 2nd gear, and warm-up after cold start. The effects of lug limits and calibration hysteresis are also presented. All projections are based on engine dynamometer data with and without cylinder deactivation, in conjunction with a second-by- second computer simulation of various test cycles (EPA City and Highway, European NEDC, and Japanese 10-15 Mode). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3592. Understanding oil aging in extended drain axle and transmission applications. Arthur Wetzel and Andreas Bein , ZF Friedrichshafen AG; and Julie A. Edgar , Richard Graham , Paul S. Greenfield , Stephen J. Nolan, and Glen D. G. McConnachie, Lubrizol Corp. Extended drain of axle and transmission lubricants has gained wide acceptance in both passenger car and commercial vehicle applications. Understanding how the lubricant changes during extended drain operations is crucial in determining appropriate lubricants and drain intervals for these applications. A suitable aging screen test with an established relationship to field performance is essential. Over the years numerous methods have been studied (DKA, GFC, ISOT, ASTM L-60) with varying degrees of success. Current methods tend to be overly severe in comparison to field experience, hence the need for further work in this area. As a result of recent work, a lubricant-aging test method has been developed which shows good correlation with field experience, giv- ing us an effective tool in the development of long drain oils. 2001-01-3594. ATF additive effects on hot spot formation in wet clutches. Donn Fairbank, BorgWarner Transmission Systems; Kenji Maruo, NSK-Warner; and Shuqin Du and Timothy Newcomb , BorgWarner Transmission Systems. Wet clutch interfaces that operate in high-energy environments experience significant frictional heating. Under such conditions, thermoelastic or thermoplastic instabilities may lead to a transition from evenly distributed surface contacts to unevenly distributed regions that manifest themselves as hot spots on the separator plate. The critical power at which these instabilities occur depend on the thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and stiffness of the com- ponents. Modeling has shown that for wet clutch interfaces the stiff- ness of the friction material has a dominant influence on the critical power. We have found that the lubricant additive package also plays a significant role in the onset of hot spots. In this paper, we report the influence of antiwear systems on the occurrence of hot spots. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3595. Comparison of extended service lubricants for heavy-duty transmissions and axles. T. J. Hansel, W. W. Mullins, and J. A. Zakarian, Chevron Products Co.; and J. A. Buitrago, Chevron Oronite Company, LLC. Over the past several years, economic pressures have driven fleets to substantially increase their maintenance intervals. To meet this challenge, both the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and the lubricant suppliers have developed new and better products to give fleet users the benefits of extended service intervals, while at the same time maintaining equipment life and providing the potential for reduced operating costs. Through the selection of proper lubricants, fleets can now minimize their total operating costs with products that meet the OEM extended service specifications, have demonstrated equipment durability, and are formulated using base oil and additive components to minimize the cost of the lubri- cant. This paper will examine the options available for formulating extended drain transmission and axle lubricants. It will explore the selection of the lubricant base oil as well as the additive system. Bench test and field test data will be compared for four products designed to meet the OEM extended service interval requirements using vastly different formulating technology. The results show that through an optimization of the base oil as well as the additive sys- tem, both synthetic- as well as mineral oil-based products can give acceptable extended drain performance. With mounting economic 436</page><page sequence="436">2001-01-3595-2001-01-3603 pressures in the trucking industry, these new products will give maintenance personnel additional choices as they move their fleets to extended drain transmission and axle lubricants in an effort to safely extend equipment life and reduce total fleet maintenance costs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3596. A hydrodynamic contact algorithm. Burkhard Scholz and Michael Bargende , University of Stuttgart. Today, mechanical systems such as the piston groups of internal combustion engines are simulated using Multiple-Body-System (MBS) approaches. However, the use of these models is restricted to a few problems as their adaptability is limited. The simulation of mechanical systems only by means of finite elements shows great promise for the future. In order to consider lubrication effects between two touching bodies of a mechanical system, a hydrody- namic contact algorithm (HCA) for finite element (FE) applications was developed. This paper discusses the technical background and first results for the simulation of a piston group using this new approach. 2001-01-3598. IP 451 aromaticity as an alternative base oil quality parameter for ASTM D 2007 saturates. Adri van de Ven, Kuwait Petroleum Research &amp; Technology B.V.; and Dominique Faure, TotalFinaElf. This paper describes the relation between the ASTM D 2007 sat- urates and the IP 45 1 aromaticity by molecular modeling and by a direct correlation using a wide range of commercial base oils. The correlation shows that the 90% mass ASTM D 2007 limit defined in the API and ATIEL base oil group definitions corresponds with a 1.7% mole IP 451 limit. The results demonstrate that the IP 451 aromaticity can be used to replace the ASTM D 2007 saturates con- tent in the API and ATIEL base oil quality definitions and inter- change guidelines. This method provides advantages in terms of precision and is also more significant in describing base oil oxida- tion performance. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3599. Quantification of active antioxidants by FTIR spectroscopy and the correlation to measured TBN values. Aref Taghizadeh and Mina D' Souza, Engine Systems Development Cen- tre (ESDC Inc.). Total base number (TBN) measurement is traditionally used to assess the ability of an engine oil to neutralize the generated acids during engine operation. Although such measurements are informa- tive, they can only determine the total quantity of the remaining anti- oxidants in the engine oil, and not the amount of active antioxidants that can effectively neutralize the acids. The work presented here investigates the activity of antioxidants in fresh and used engine oils by Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and their cor- relation to the TBN values obtained by titration. The method is based on the reaction of an acid solution with the alkaline ingredient of the engine oil in a non-polar solvent that mimics the actual envi- ronment experienced by the antioxidants. FTIR Spectroscopy is used to monitor the consumption of the acid. The decrease in peak intensity of the acid is then employed to quantify the remaining active antioxidants through a calibration curve. According to the experimental results, FTIR values correlate well with TBN values for fresh oils, however, lesser correlations were found for used engine oils. These results tend to indicate that oil contamination may have an inhibition effect on the activity of antioxidants and that titrometric TBN measurements do not ade- quately represent the neutralization ability of used engine oils. The FTIR method described herein could serve as a valuable tool to assess the remaining useful life of the oil and complement selected condition monitoring methods (such as viscosity measurements, ele- mental analysis, etc.) employed in preventive/predictive mainte- nance programs. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3600. (SP- 1648) Considering the effects of cyclic variations when modeling the performance of a spark ignition engine. S. O. Bade Shrestha, Alternative Fuel Systems Inc.; and G. A. Karim, University of Calgary. An approach for simulating cyclic variations in spark ignition engines is described. It is based on a stochastic modeling coupled to a comprehensive model developed for predicting engine perfor- mance, mainly for gas-fueled engine applications. Such an approach is shown capable of generating cycle-to-cycle variations of pressure- time development records that are in good agreement with experi- ment. An account of the corresponding extent of cyclic variation in major performance parameters can be also established. It is demon- strated that the probability of the incidence of knock can be deter- mined for any set of operating and design conditions while using this approach with sufficiently comprehensive detailed chemical kinetics. Examples involving mainly methane operation are shown. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3601. (SP-1648) Improvement of engine heat- transfer calculation in the three-dimensional simulation using a phenomenological heat-transfer model. Marco Chiodi and Michael Bargende, University of Stuttgart. Improvement of heat-transfer calculation for SI engines in the three-dimensional simulation has been achieved and widely been tested by using a phenomenological heat-transfer model. The model is based on the local application of an improved Re-Nu-correlation (dimensional analysis) proposed by Bargende. This approach takes advantage of long experience in engine heat transfer modeling in the real working process analysis. The results of numerous simulations of different engine meshes show that the proposed heat-transfer model enables to calculate the overall as well as the local heat trans- fer in good agreement with both real working process analyses and experimental investigations. The influence of the mesh structure has also been remarkably reduced and compared to the standard wall function approach, no additional CPU time is required. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3602. (SP-1648) Numerical analysis of gas exchange and combustion process in a small two-stroke gasoline engine. M. Mugele, J. Tribulowski, H. Peters, and U. Spicher, University of Karlsruhe; and H. Rosskamp, Andreas STIHL AG &amp; Co. This paper analyzes the scavenge process of a conventional two- stroke engine in order to find ways to significantly reduce the scav- enge losses by applying a combination of ID and 3D simulation pro- cedures. A special evaluation method was developed which allows a clear distinction between the main hydrocarbon loss mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper presents an approach to simulate the highly turbulent combustion at a speed of 9000 rpm. The results of the numerical investigations are compared with experimental results. The engine chosen for this purpose was a 64 cm3 four-port pro- duction two-stroke engine. The CFD calculations were performed using the finite volume CFD code STAR-CD. The mesh generation process was automated using pro*am. Combustion was modeled with the one-equation Weller flamelet model. The results of the present study show that the combination of ID and 3D simulation procedures is a powerful tool for further investi- gations (e.g., stratified charge, GDI). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3603.

Sadami Yoshiyama and Eiji Tomita, Oka- yama Univ.; Zhong Zhang, Industrial Technology Center of Oka- yama Prefecture ; and Yoshisuke Hamamoto, University of Kitakyusyu. The several burning models based on the wrinkled laminar flame concept had been proposed and applied to the turbulent premixed flame in a spark ignition engine. Fractal burning model is one of the flamelet burning models. However the formulations of fractal char- acteristics such as fractal dimension, inner cutoff scale and outer 437</page><page sequence="437">2001-01-3603-2001-01-3609 cutoff scale weren't established. These formulations based on the results of the fractal analysis in a constant volume vessel and a spark ignition engine were proposed in this study. The fractal dimension is expressed as a function of non-dimensional turbulence intensity and the density of mixture. Non-dimensional inner cutoff scale is . expressed a ftmction of Karlovitz number. Outer cutoff scale is equal to the flame radius. Finally the quasidimensional model for turbulent combustion was performed by using the fractal burning model with our formulations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3604.

Three cases (20 RPM, 40 RPM and 60 RPM) are examined and discussed. From the comparison of the three different cases, there are obvious cyclic variations for different piston velocities. The discrepancies in the cases demonstrate that the transition to turbulence occurs at the lower RPM (e.g. } 20 RPM while fully developed turbulence seems to start at the higher RPMs (e.g.) 40 and 60 RPM. These, therefore, suggest that 2D PIV used in previous measurement is valid at lower RPM because the measurement actually measures the jet or the tur- bulence transition from jet, but 3D stereoscopic PIV is certainly bet- ter and necessary at higher RPM due to the 3D character of the tur- bulence. The work will assist in the design of new experiments, and provide direction for improving modeling techniques. 2001-01-3605. (SP- 1648) Multicomponent fuel spark ignition and combustion models. Baifang Zuo and Christopher J. Rutland, University of Wisconsin. Many commercial fuels, including gasoline and diesel, are multi- component hydrocarbons. During the fuel vaporization process, the volatile components evaporate first, which dominate the region near the nozzle exit. The lately evaporated vapor with high penetration has high molecular weight. Thus, ignition and combustion of multi- component fuels are not only influenced by distribution of fuel vapor mass fraction, but also by distribution of the components. This paper presents a spark ignition and combustion model with consid- eration of such multicomponent effects for GDI engines. Ignition kernel growth due to flame front propagation is considered in the model to eliminate the sensitivity of the numerical mesh size on the results. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3606. (SP- 1642) Dilution effects on the controlled auto-ignition (CAI) combustion of hydrocarbon and alcohol fuels. Aaron Oakley, Hua Zhao, and Nicos Ladommatos, Brunei Univ.; and Tom Ma, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents results from an experimental program researching the in-cylinder conditions necessary to obtain homoge- nous CAI (or HCCI) combustion in a 4-stroke engine. The fuels under investigation include three blends of Unleaded Gasoline, a 95 RON Primary Reference Fuel, Methanol, and Ethanol. This work concentrates on establishing the CAI operating range with regard to Air/Fuel ratio and Exhaust Gas Re-circulation and their effect on the ignition timing, combustion rate and variability, Indicated thermal efficiency, and engine-out emissions such as NOx. Detailed maps are presented, defining how each of the measured variables changes over the entire CAI region. Results indicate that the alcohols have significantly higher toler- ance to dilution than the hydrocarbon fuels tested. Also, variations in Gasoline blend have little effect on any of the combustion param- eters measured. 2001 SAE Transections Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3607. (SP- 1642) Understanding the effects of recy- cled burnt gases on the controlled autoignition (CAI) combus- tion in four-stroke gasoline engines. H. Zhao, Z. Peng, J. Wil- liams, and N. Ladommatos , Brunei Univ. Controlled Auto-Ignition (CAI) combustion, also known as HCCI or PCCI, has recently emerged as a viable alternative combus- tion process to the conventional spark ignition (SI) or compression ignition (CI) process for internal combustion (IC) engines, owing to its potential for high efficiency and extremely low emissions. One of the most effective and practical means of achieving CAI combus- tion in an engine is to retain or recycle the burnt gases. In order to understand better the effects of recycled burnt gases on CAI com- bustion, detailed analytical and experimental studies have been car- ried out. The analytical studies were performed using an engine sim- ulation model with detailed chemical kinetics. The five effects of the recycled burned gases studied include: Charge heating effect: higher intake charge temperature due to hot burned gases; Dilution effect: the reduction of oxygen due to the presence of the burned gases; Heat capacity effect: due to higher specific heat capacity of burned gases; Chemical effect: chemical reactions involving CO2 and H2O in the burned gases Stratification effect: recycled burned gases are stratified from the fuel/air mixture. And the main conclusions are: The charge heating effect is mainly responsible for the advanced AI timing due to hot burned gases. It increases the heat release rate and shortens the combustion duration. The dilution effect does not affect AI timing, but it extends combustion duration. Its slows down the heat release rate only when large amount of burned gases is present. The heat capacity effect is mainly responsible for the reduction in the heat release rate, and it has a similar effect to extend the combustion duration as the dilution effect. The chemical effect does not affect AI timing and heat release rate. It reduces the combustion duration slightly at high con- centrations of burned gases. The stratified burned gases facilitate the CAI combustion due to the presence of higher temperature region at the boundary between of the hot burned gases and combustible charge. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3608. (SP- 1642) Research and development of con- trolled auto-ignition (CAI) combustion in a 4-stroke multi- cylinder gasoline engine. Jian Li, Hua Zhao, and Nicos Ladomma- tos, Brunei Univ.; and Tom Ma, Ford Motor Co. Controlled Auto-Ignition (CAI) combustion has been achieved in a production type 4-stroke multi-cylinder gasoline engine. The engine was based on a Ford 1.7L Zetec-SE 16V engine with a com- pression ratio of 10.3, using substantially standard components modified only in design dimensions to control the gas exchange pro- cess in order to significantly increase the trapped residuals. The engine was also equipped with Variable Cam Timing (VCT) on both the intake and exhaust camshafts. It was found that the largely increased trapped residuals alone were sufficient to achieve CAI in this engine and with VCT, a range of loads between 0.5 and 4 bar BMEP and engine speeds between 1000 and 3500 rpm were mapped for CAI fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. The measured CAI results were compared with those of Spark Ignition (SI) com- bustion in the same engine but with standard camshafts at the same speeds and loads. The comparison showed more than 30% reduction in BSFC and up to 99% reduction in NOx at low loads. 2001 SAE Transections Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3609.

Fiv eland and Rey Agama, Caterpillar Inc.; Mag- nus Christensen, Bengt Johansson, Joel Hiltner, and Fabian Maus, Lund Institute of Technology ; and Dennis N. Assanis, University of Michigan. Natural gas quality, in terms of the volume fraction of higher hydrocarbons, strongly affects the auto-ignition characteristics of the air-fuel mixture, the engine performance and its controllability. The influence of natural gas composition on engine operation has 438</page><page sequence="438">2001-01-3609-2001-01-3613 been investigated both experimentally and through chemical kinetic based cycle simulation. A range of two component gas mixtures has been tested with methane as the base fuel. The equivalence ratio (0.3), the compression ratio (19.8), and the engine speed (1000 rpm) were held constant in order to isolate the impact of fuel autoignition chemistry. For each fuel mixture, the start of combustion was phased near top dead center (TDC) and then the inlet mixture tem- perature was reduced. These experimental results have been utilized as a source of data for the validation of a chemical kinetic-based full-cycle simulation. Results reported here clearly demonstrate the ability of a thermo-kinetic, single-zone model to capture the fuel composition effects seen in the experiments. The uncertainty that exists in both the experiment and simulation is discussed in light of the model predictions. This uncertainty is used to quantify what rea- sonable level of accuracy can be expected between a model and experiment under HCCI operation. Finally, the simulation has been further exercised to compute the sensitivity of ignition timing to changes in hydrocarbon composition outside what has been experi- mentally tested. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3610. (SP- 1642) A four-stroke camless engine, oper- ated in homogeneous charge compression ignition mode with commercial gasoline. Lucien Koopmans, Volvo Car Corp.; and Ingemar Denbratt, Chalmers University of Technology. A single-cylinder, naturally aspirated, four-stroke and camless (Otto) engine was operated in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode with commercial gasoline. The valve timing could be adjusted during engine operation, which made it possible to optimize the HCCI engine operation for different speed and load points in the part-load regime of a 5-cylinder, 2.4-liter engine. Several tests were made with differing combinations of speed and load conditions, while varying the valve timing and the inlet manifold air pressure. Starting with conventional SI combustion, the negative valve overlap was increased until HCCI combustion was obtained. Then the influences of the equivalence ratio and the exhaust valve opening were investigated. With the engine operating on HCCI combustion, unthrottled and without preheating, the exhaust valve opening, the exhaust valve closing and the intake valve closing were optimized next. Finally, with three valve timing events, an HCCI operational window was identified. Using only three valve timing events, an engine operational win- dow for HCCI combustion was obtained with: a maximum load of about 3.5 bar, a minimum load of about 0.1 bar, a maximum speed about 3000 rpm, and a minimum speed about 1200 rpm. The win- dow for HCCI combustion is restricted by zones of knock (on the high load part) and by cycle-to-cycle variations in cylinder pressure (on the low load part) at high and low engine speeds. Between HCCI combustion and conventional SI combustion, there is a transient interval during which a spark triggers the auto ignition. A clear ben- efit in reduced CO emissions, NOx emissions (close to zero), and fuel consumption was observed during HCCI engine operation, compared with conventional SI combustion whereas the level of hydrocarbon emissions was approximately the same. The EVC has the greatest influence on the HCCI auto-ignition delay for the engine operating parameters tested. The influence of EVO is controlled by the gas dynamics and IVC has only a minor effect on engine behavior. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3611. (SP-1642) Combustion improvement of a pre- mixed charge compression ignition methanol engine using flash boiling fuel injection. Toshiyuki Seko and Eiji Kuroda , Japan Auto- mobile Research Institute. A premixed charge compression ignition methanol engine target- ing a drastic decrease in NOx emissions and a brake specific energy consumption equivalent to that of a DI diesel engine has been devel- oped. The problems of this combustion system are that the brake thermal efficiency decreases, and CO and THC emissions increase due to a deterioration of high load combustion. The purpose of this study is to improve the high load combustion of a premixed charge compression ignition methanol engine using a flash boiling fuel injection technique. The results of this study have shown that the premixed charge compression ignition methanol combustion system using a flash boiling fuel injection technique increases the brake thermal effi- ciency, decreases CO and THC emissions, while maintaining low NOx emissions in the high load region. The reason may be that heat- ing the fuel prior to injection causes flash boiling to occur, and the spray penetration is reduced, so that a suitable mixture is formed in the cylinder. With regard to the performance of the premixed charge compression ignition methanol combustion system using flash boil- ing fiiel injection, the NOx emissions were cut by over one half, and the brake specific energy consumption was superior than that of a conventional diesel engine, at high loads. Particularly, when the brake specific energy consumption was 10 MJ/kWh at high load operation, NOx emissions decreased to as low as 3 g/kWh. 2001-01-3612. (SP-1642) A decoupled model of detailed fluid mechanics followed by detailed chemical kinetics for prediction of iso-octane HCCI combustion. Salvador M. Aceves, Joel Marti- nez-Frias, Daniel L. Flowers, and J. Ray Smith, Lawrence Liver- more National Laboratory ; Robert W. Dibble, University of Califor- nia Berkeley ; John F. Wright, Cummins Engine Co.; and Randy P. Hessel, University of Wisconsin. We have developed a methodology for predicting combustion and emissions in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine. The methodology judiciously uses a fluid mechan- ics code followed by a chemical kinetics code to achieve great reduction in the computational requirements; to a level that can be handled with current computers. In previous papers, our sequential, multi-zone methodology has been applied to HCCI combustion of short-chain hydrocarbons (natural gas and propane). Applying the same procedure to long-chain hydrocarbons (iso-octane) results in unacceptably long computational time. In this paper, we show how the computational time can be made acceptable by developing a seg- regated solver. This reduces the run time of a ten-zone problem by an order of magnitude and thus makes it much more practical to make combustion studies of long-chain hydrocarbons. This sequential, multi-zone methodology is here applied to ana- lyze recent experimental results for combustion of iso-octane in an HCCI engine. The numerical results agree well with the experimen- tal results for all the combustion parameters, and the model also makes reasonable predictions for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The paper also includes a sensitivity analysis on how the resolution of the grid used in the fluid mechanics code affects the results of the HCCI combustion analysis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3613. (SP-1642) Equivalence ratio-EGR control of HCCI engine operation and the potential for transition to spark- ignited operation. Joel Martinez-Frias, Salvador M. Aceves, Dan- iel Flowers, and J. Ray Smith, Lawrence Livermore National Labo- ratory ,š and Robert Dibble, University of California at Berkeley. This research investigates a control system for HCCI engines, where equivalence ratio, fraction of EGR and intake pressure are adjusted as needed to obtain satisfactory combustion. HCCI engine operation is analyzed with a detailed chemical kinetics code, HCT (Hydrodynamics, Chemistry and Transport), that has been exten- sively modified for application to engines. HCT is linked to an opti- mizer that determines the operating conditions that result in maxi- mum brake thermal efficiency, while meeting the peak cylinder pressure restriction. The results show the values of the operating conditions that yield optimum efficiency as a function of torque and rpm. The engine has high NOx emissions for high power operation, so the possibility of switching to stoichiometric operation for high torque conditions is considered. Stoichiometric operation would allow the use of a three-way catalyst to reduce NOx emissions to acceptable levels. Finally, the paper discusses the possibility of tran- 439</page><page sequence="439">2001-01-3613-2001-01-3619 sitioning from HCCI operation to SI operation to achieve high power output. 2001-01-3614. (SP- 1642) Gasoline HCCI modeling: Com- puter program combining detailed chemistry and gas exchange processes. Roy Ogink and Valen Golovitchev , Chalmers University Of Technology. A skeletal reaction mechanism (101 species, 479 reactions) for a range of aliphatic hydrocarbons was constructed for application to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) Gasoline Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine modeling. The mecha- nism is able to predict shock tube ignition delays and premixed flame propagation velocities for the following components: hydro- gen (H2), methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), propane (C3H8), n-heptane (C7H16) and iso-octane (CgHig). The mechanism is integrated with a simulation code combining both modeling of detailed chemistry and gas exchange processes. This simulation tool was constructed by connecting the SENKIN code of the CHEMKIN library to the AVL BOOST™ engine cycle simulation code. Using a complete engine cycle simulation code instead of a code that only considers the combustion process has a major advantage. The initial conditions at the intake valve closure (IVC) have no longer to be set. Typical initial conditions for a sin- gle-zone model are the average temperature of the mixture in the cylinder, the cylinder pressure and the species concentrations. When the engine cycle simulation code is used, the initial conditions con- sist of geometrical data for engine components and pressures and temperatures at different locations in the model scheme representing engine components connected by pipe elements. As gas exchange processes are included in the engine cycle simulation, the program will calculate the conditions at the IVC. The simulation program is used for parametric studies of the combustion process in the single-cylinder HCCI test engine at Chal- mers University of Technology. Furthermore, provision for a link to future multidimensional CFD engine modeling is made. The model was matched to different test cases based on experimental data in order to obtain a tool giving accurate predictions for the dif- ferent combinations of speed, load, excess air/fuel ratio and valve timings that are characteristic for the HCCI engine operation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3616. (SP- 1641) Particles and emissions from a diesel engine equipped with a humid air motor system. Kent Nord , Dan Haupt , and Karl-Erik Egebäck, Luleâ University of Technology. A humid air motor system (HAM) for NOx reduction has been connected to an eleven liters diesel engine. Earlier studies have dem- onstrated that the system has capacity to lower NOx emissions from diesel engines. The present study is directed to investigate the influ- ence of the system on the emissions of particles and aldehydes, to monitor essential engine parameters, water consumption, and to ver- ify the NOx reducing ability. The system has been tested under the various speed and load conditions stated in the 13-mode ECE R-49 test procedure. Additional tests have been carried out for sampling and measurements of particles. The results showed that the particle number concentration usually increased when HAM was coupled to the engine. The increase in particle number concentration, observed in five out of six running modes, varied between 46% and 148%. There was no observed trend indicating a shift in mean particle diameter when using HAM. Engine performance was almost unaf- fected, while the HAM system caused a large reduction of the NOx emissions. Even without optimization of the experimental condi- tions the average reduction of NOx during the different modes of ECE R-49 was over 51%. The reduction was directly related to the humidity of the inlet air and a further reduction can be anticipated with higher humidity. The influence of the system on the emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) was negligible while a moderate increase in the emission of carbon monoxide (CO) was noticed. No confident relationship between air humidity and the observed effects (i.e., on HC and CO) could be detected. Samples were also taken for acetal- dehyde and formaldehyde. The results are indicating a reduction of aldehydes in the range 78% to 100%, when using HAM. Unfortu- nately these large reductions may be false, since it cannot be excluded that they are a result of a combination of high air humidity and the sampling technique used. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3617. (SP- 1641) The influence of an on-line oil recy- cler on emissions from a low emission DI diesel engine as a func- tion of oil age. Gordon E. Andrews and Jie Xu, University of Leeds; and J. Hall, A. A. Rahman, and P. Mawson, Top High UK Ltd. A method of cleaning lubricating oil on-line was investigated using a fine ljum bypass particulate filter followed by a 150°C infra- red heater, to remove water and light diesel fractions in the oil. The impact of this oil recycler on diesel particulate and gaseous emis- sions was investigated over a 72-hour oil age. Comparison tests were undertaken without and with the recycler on a Euro 2 Perkins Phaser 180Ti, 6-cylinder, 6-liter, turbo-charged inter-cooled DI die- sel engine fitted with an oxidation catalyst. Emissions were sampled from both upstream and downstream of the catalyst about every 10 hours. The tests were carried out at 2000rpm and lOOkW with 473 Nm load. A stop start test cycle was used with a cold start each time and a typical test period of 2 hours. The results showed that this engine had extremely low particulate emissions and was well inside the Euro 2 emissions limits. The average value of particulate emis- sions downstream of the catalyst without the recycler was 0.06 g/kg fuel under the steady-state test condition. The engine out particulate emissions were reduced by 17% and the particulate emissions sam- pled downstream of the catalyst were reduced by 29% on average using the recycler. The reduction in total particulate emissions was mainly due to the reduction in particulate carbon and unburned lube oil VOF emissions. There was no significant impact of the recycler on gaseous and smoke emissions. The reduction in particulate emis- sions was attributed to the 21% reduced oil consumption and improved oil quality using the recycler. The catalyst efficiencies for the total particulate mass and VOF were improved by 41% and 74% respectively using the recycler, which could be due to the reduced engine out ash emissions. 2001-01-3618.

Octavio Armas, Rosario Ballesteros, and Arantzazu Gómez, University of Castilla - La Mancha. This paper shows the morphological analysis results of particu- late matter emissions from an indirect injection diesel engine work- ing in two operating modes using Digital Image Analysis Algo- rithms (DIAA) and a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). Two typical engine operating modes were selected among the collection of steady stages, which reproduce the sequence of operating condi- tions that the vehicles equipped with this type of engines must fol- low during the transient cycle established in the European Emission Directive 70/220. The DIAA results were obtained from images of particulate matter collected in filters. The filters were charged in a dilution mini-tunnel, connected up-stream and down-stream of a cyclone-based particulate filtration system, which was coupled to the engine exhaust line. The images were obtained by a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) from samples taken directly from the charged filters. All the obtained results were compared with the SMPS measurements at the same operating condition and the same sampling points. 2001-01-3619.

The goal of this project was to achieve hot-start HDDE-FTP emissions consistent with the recently announced 2007 U.S. heavy-duty engine emissions standards. Supply of hydrocarbon reductant for NOx adsorber regeneration was accomplished via a secondary exhaust fuel injection system. An alternating restriction of the exhaust flow between the two flow paths allowed injection and adsorber regeneration to occur under very low space velocity conditions. NOx and PM emissions over the hot-start portion of the HDDE-FTP transient cycle were 0.13 g/bhp-hr and less than 0.002 g/bhp-hr, respectively. 2001-01-3620. (SP- 1641) Research approach for aging and evaluating diesel lean-NOx catalysts. W. Scott Wayne , Jason M. Snyder , Nigel N. Clark , Mridul Gautam, and Donald W. Lyons, West Virginia Univ.; Shouxian Ren, International Truck and Engine Co.; John Storey, Oak Ridge National Laboratories ; and Wendy Clark, National Renewal Energy Laboratory. The goal of the Diesel Emissions Control-Sulfur Effects (DECSE) program was to determine the impact of diesel fuel sulfur levels on emissions control devices that could lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) from on- highway trucks and buses. West Virginia University (WVU) per- formed evaluations of lean-NOx catalysts to determine the effects of fuel sulfur content on emissions reduction efficiency and catalyst durability in the first 250 hours of operation. A Cummins ISM370 engine (10.8 liter, 370 horsepower), typical of heavy-duty truck applications, was utilized to evaluate high-temperature lean-NOx catalyst while a Navistar T444E (7.3 liter, 210 horsepower), typical of medium-duty applications, was used to evaluate low-temperature catalyst. Catalysts were evaluated periodically during the first 250 hours of exposure to exhaust from engines operated on 3ppm, 30ppm, 150ppm and 350ppm sulfur content diesel fuel. Lean-NOx catalysts require the injection of hydrocarbons (diesel fuel) upstream of the catalyst to promote NOx reduction. Prior to the catalyst aging experiments, the hydrocarbon (HC) reductant injection rate was optimized to yield significant NOx reduction while controlling HC slippage. The low temperature lean-NOx catalysts showed an aver- age 15% NOx reduction efficiency accompanied by an increase in HC emissions of 40% to 15 times. No clear effects on PM emissions were observed except for 350ppm fuel at 250 aging hours where PM emissions increased by 3.3 times. The increase of PM can be attri- buted to sulfate (SO4). The high temperature catalysts had an aver- age reduction efficiency of 11% for NOx, an increase in HC emis- sions of 1-8.5 times and an increase in PM emissions after 250 aging hours. 2001-01-3621. (SP-1641) A toxicological evaluation of poten- tial thermal degradation products of urea. James C. Ball, Ford Motor Co. The purpose of this paper is to make a preliminary assessment of the potential toxicity of compounds that might be emitted from diesel vehicles using urea/SCR technology. The use of urea as a reductant in the removal of NOx from the exhaust of diesel-powered vehicles has the potential to emit at least seven thermal decomposi- tion products and unreacted urea from the tail-pipe. These com- pounds include: urea, ammonia, cyanate ion, biuret, cyanuric acid, ammelide, ammeline, and melamine. The toxicity data base for these compounds, in general, is poor. In addition, there have been few, if any, studies examining the inhalation route of exposure - the most likely route of exposure for people from vehicle exhaust. The measurement and identification of these compounds from the exhaust of urea/SCR-equipped vehicles is needed to prioritize the kinds of health effects studies required to understand the toxicity of these compounds. 2001-01-3622. (SP-1641) An on-board reductant delivery sys- tem for diesel aftertreatment. Ching-Hsong ( George ) Wu and Robert Hammerle, Ford Motor Co. It has become evident that almost all diesel aftertreatment devices dealing with NOx and particulate matter (PM) controls require the addition of one or more reducing agents (réductants), such as diesel fuel, ammonia, or aqueous urea to enhance their effi- ciency and durability. These reductants can be used to catalytically convert NOx to N2, to enrich the air fuel ratio (A/F), or to increase temperatures for regenerating PM filters or for de-sulfating NOx traps. A number of injection methods have been developed recently to provide easy reductant addition. However, many of them may be cumbersome, costly, or ineffective. This paper describes a new reductant delivery system, which appears to minimize these short- comings. To be effective, the manner of reductant injection into the exhaust is critical. First, the reductant must be added quickly to accommodate the fast transient operations. Secondly, precisely mea- sured quantities of reductant must be added to match the NOx levels or to achieve the desired temperature or A/F. Thirdly, the reductant must be finely dispersed to allow effective utilization on catalytic surfaces. In addition, the delivery system must withstand the harsh environment of high temperature and high PM emissions of the die- sel exhaust. The newly developed on-board reductant delivery sys- tem, which comprises only three components, not only achieves the above criteria, but also offers simplicity, compactness, light weight, high energy efficiency, excellent durability, and low cost. 2001-01-3623. (SP-1641) Application of urea SCR to light- duty diesel vehicles. Christine Lambert, John Vanderslice, Robert Hammerle, and Rich Belaire, Ford Research Laboratory. Diesel vehicles have significant advantages over their gasoline counterparts including a more efficient engine, higher fuel economy, and lower emissions of HC, CO, and CO2. However, NOx control is more difficult on a diesel because of the high O2 concentration in the exhaust, making conventional three-way catalysts ineffective. The most promising technology for continuous NOx reduction onboard diesel vehicles is Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) using aqueous urea. Recent work with urea SCR has involved aftertreatment for the 1.2L DIATA common-rail diesel engine. This engine was used in Ford's hybrid-electric vehicle, the Prodigy, which was developed under the PNGV (Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles) program. An emission control system consisting of a diesel particu- late filter followed by an underbody SCR system was used success- fully to meet ULEV emission standards (0.2 g/mi NOx, 0.04 g/mi particulate matter (PM)). Actual measured PM was close to gasoline levels of 1 mg/mi over the FTP. After each FTP, Highway Fuel Economy Tests were performed to monitor fuel economy and study system efficiency at higher exhaust gas temperatures. 2001-01-3624. (SP-1641) Investigations into NOx aftertreat- ment with urea SCR for light-duty diesel vehicles. P. G. Blake- man, G. R. Chandler, G. A. John, and A. J. J. Wilkins, Johnson Mat- they. Future US emissions limits are likely to mean a sophisticated nitrogen oxide (NOx) reduction technique is required for all vehicles with a diesel engine, which is likely to be either NOx trap or selec- tive catalytic reduction (SCR) technology. To investigate the poten- tial of SCR for NOx reduction on a light-duty vehicle, a current model vehicle (EUII Ml calibration), of inertia weight 1810 kg, was equipped with an urea-based SCR injection system and non- vanadium, non-zeolitic SCR catalysts. To deal with carbon monox- ide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and volatile organic fraction (VOF), a diesel oxidation catalyst was also incorporated into the system for most tests. Investigations into the effect of placing the oxidation cat- alyst at different positions in the system, changing the volume of the SCR catalysts, increasing system temperature through road load changes, varying the SCR catalyst composition, and changing the 441</page><page sequence="441">2001-01-3624-2001-01-3630 urea injection calibration are discussed.

(SP- 1641) Recent advances in the development of urea-SCR for automotive applications. Manfred Koebel, Mar- tin Elsener, and Giuseppe Madia, Paul Scherrer Institute. In the recent years, considerable progress has been achieved in the development of urea-SCR for nonstationary, mobile applica- tions. Main challenges are the reduction of the catalyst volumes and the optimization of the dosing strategy to minimize transient ammo- nia emissions during load changes. Catalysts with increased cell density and enhanced intrinsic activity are one way to obtain smaller catalyst volumes. Another approach is the introduction of additional catalysts upstream and downstream of the SCR catalyst itself. Most effective is an oxidizing precatalyst that converts a part of NO to NO2, thus allowing a faster SCR reaction to occur. However, such a system requires the use of fuel with reduced sulfur content. Work performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute comprises of fun- damental experiments in a laboratory scale reactor with synthetic exhaust gas and applied experiments on a diesel test stand. In addi- tion to the evaluation of various commercial and proprietary cata- lysts, important problems of the process have been investigated as, for example, the fast SCR reaction, ammonia adsorption on the cata- lysts, the decomposition of urea, and catalyst aging. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3626. (SP- 1647) Emission characteristics of a Navi- star 7.3L turbodiesel fueled with blends of dimethyl ether and diesel fuel. Elana M. Chapman and André L. Boehman, The Penn- sylvania State Univ.; Peter Tijm, Rentech, Inc.; and Francis Waller, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Several oxygenates have been proposed and tested for use with diesel fuel as a means of reducing exhaust emissions. This paper examines dimethyl ether (DME), which can be produced in many ways including via Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.'s, Liquid Phase Technology (LPDME™). Modest additions of DME into die- sel fuel (2 wt.% oxygen) showed reductions in particulate matter emissions, but the previous data reported by the author from a multi- cylinder Navistar 7.3L Turbodiesel engine were scattered. In this study, experiments were performed on a multi-cylinder Navistar 7.3L Turbodiesel engine to repeatably confirm and extend the obser- vations from the earlier studies. This is an important step in not only showing that the fuel does perform well in an engine with minor modifications to the fuel system, but also showing that DME can give consistent, significant results in lowering emissions. The DME and diesel blends tested were to achieve a net addition of 5 and 10 wt. % oxygen in the blended fuel. The data confirms that the addi- tion of DME can reduce the particulate emissions from a compres- sion ignition engine. However, the NOx emissions were not favor- able for all conditions. It is believed that through further modifica- tion of injection timing, NOx emissions can be effectively reduced. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3627.

Gonzalez D., PDVSA Intevep ; Eleanor Liney, Equilon Enterprises; Mani Natarajan, Marathon Ashland Petroleum Co.; and James P. Wallace III, Wallace Associates, LLC. The objective of this study was to quantify engine-out emissions of potentially toxic compounds from a modern diesel engine oper- ated with different fuels including 15% v/v dimethoxy methane in a low sulfur diesel fuel. Five diesel fuels were examined: a low- sulfur, low-aromatic hydrocracked (~1 ppm) fuel, the same low sul- fur fuel containing 15% v/v dimethoxy methane, a Fischer-Tropsch fuel, a CARB fuel, and an EPA number 2 certification fuel. A Daim- lerChrysler OM61 1 CIDI engine was controlled with a SwRI Rapid Prototyping Electronic Control system. The engine was operated over 4 speed-load modes. Each operating mode and fuel combina- tion was run in triplicate. Thirty three potentially toxic compounds were measured for each fuel and mode. An analysis of variance of the fuels showed that, in general, the 15% v/v dimethoxy methane fuel and the Fisher-Tropsch fuels had significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) emissions of measured compounds compared to the remaining fuels and were statistically indistinguishable from each other. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3628.

A weighted composite of four engine-operating modes, represen- tative of typical operating modes found in the US FTP driving schedule, were used to compare engine-out emissions of toxic com- pounds using five diesel fuels. The fuels examined were: a low- sulfur low-aromatic hydrocracked diesel fuel, the same low-sulfiir fuel containing 15% v/v dimethoxy methane, a Fischer-Tropsch fuel, a CARB fuel, and a EPA number 2 diesel certification fuel. A DaimlerChrysler OM611 CIDI engine was operated over 4 speed- load modes: mode 5, 2600 RPM, 8.8 BMEP; mode 6, 2300 RPM, 4.2 BMEP; mode 10, 2000 RPM, 2.0 BMEP; mode 11, 1500 RPM, 2.6 BMEP. The four engine operating modes were weighted as fol- lows: mode 5, 25/1200; mode 6, 200/1200; mode 10, 375/1200; and mode 11, 600/1200. Each operating mode and fuel combination was run in triplicate. An analysis of variance of fuels showed that, in general, the 15% v/v dimethoxy methane fuel and the Fisher- Tropsch fuels had significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) emissions of mea- sured compounds compared to the remaining fuels and were statisti- cally indistinguishable from each other. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3629. (SP-1647) The performance of a heavy-duty diesel engine with a production feasible DME injection system. Denis Gill, Herwig Ofner, and Daniel Schwarz, AVL List GmbH; and Eddie Sturman, and Marc Andrew Wolverton, Sturman Indus- tries. Over the last few years there has been much interest in DiMethyl Ether (DME) as an alternative fuel for diesel cycle engines. It com- bines the advantages of a high cetane number with soot-free com- bustion, which makes it eminently suitable for compression ignition engines. However, due to the fact that it is a gas under ambient con- ditions, it requires special fuel handling and a specially designed fuel injection system, which until recently, was not available. The use of the digital hydraulic operating system (DHOS), com- bined with a fuel handling system designed to cope with the proper- ties of DME, enables the fuel to be safely and conveniently handled. In addition, the flexibility of the injection system enables injection pressures to be chosen according to the needs of the combustion. Tests results on a single-cylinder, heavy-duty test engine show that the fuel system enables the benefits in combustion and emis- sions associated with DME to be realized, while using a fuel injec- tion and handling system which has potential for production. 2001-01-3630.

The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of pilot fuel injection on engine-out emissions of potentially toxic compounds from a modern diesel engine operated with different fuels including 15% v/v dimethoxy methane in a low-sulfiir diesel fuel.

A DaimlerChrys- ler OM611 CIDI engine was controlled with a SwRI Rapid Proto- typing Electronic Control system. The pilot fuel injection was either turned off or turned on with engine control by either Location of Peak Pressure (LPP) of combustion or the original equipment manu- facturer (OEM) calibration strategy. These three control strategies were compared over 2 speed-load modes run in triplicate. Thirty- three potentially toxic compounds were measured. In general, either pilot fuel injection strategy (LPP or OEM) produced higher emis- sions than with pilot injection turned off. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3631. (SP- 1647) Oxygenates for advanced petrole- um-based diesel fuels: Part 1. Screening and selection methodol- ogy for the oxygenates. Mani Natarajan, Marathon Ashland Petro- leum Co.; Edwin A. Frame and David W. Naegeli, Southwest Research Institute; Tom Asmus, DaimlerChrysler; Wendy Clark, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; John Garbak, U. S. Department of Energy; Manuel A. González D., PDVSA Intevep; Eleanor Liney, Equilon Enterprises; Wiliam Piel, Consultant ; and James P. Wallace III, Wallace Associates. The overall program objectives were three fold: assess the bene- fits and limitations of oxygenated diesel fuels on engine perfor- mance and emissions; identify oxygenates most suitable for poten- tial use in future diesel formulations based on physico-chemical properties (e.g., flash point), toxicity, biodegradability and esti- mated cost of production; perform limited emissions and perfor- mance testing of the oxygenated diesel blends; and select at least two oxygenated compounds for advanced engine testing. In Part 1 of this program which is described in this paper, an extensive literature review was conducted to identify potential oxy- genates for blending into diesel fuels. As many as 71 oxygenates were identified for the initial screening process. Based on a set of physical and chemical properties, a screening methodology was developed to select the 8 oxygenates that will be eligible for engine testing. The following properties were used: oxygen content, flash point, solubility in low aromatic diesel fuel and stability; fuel prop- erties such as viscosity, cetane number and lubricity; corrosivity; elastomer compatibility; toxicity; and biodegradability. Initial screening resulted in 43 candidate oxygenates. Properties not found in the literature such as solubility and corrosivity were evaluated using bench tests. These tests resulted in the selection of eight oxygenates for engine testing in Part 2 of this program. These oxygenates were blended with alternative low sulfur diesel (ALS) to achieve an oxygen content of 7 wt%. Tables showing oxygenate properties are included. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3632. Oxygenates screening for advanced petrole- um-based diesel fuels: Part 2. The effect of oxygenate blending compounds on exhaust emissions. Manuel A. González D., PDVSA Intevep ; William Piel, Consultant ; Tom Asmus, DaimlerChrysler ; Wendy Clark, National Renewable Energy Laboratory; John Gar- bak, U. S. Department of Energy; Eleanor Liney, Equilon Enter- prises; Mani Natarajan, Marathon Ashland Petroleum Co.; David W. Naegeli, Doug Yost, and Edwin A. Frame, Southwest Research Institute; and James P. Wallace III, Wallace Associates. Adding oxygenates to diesel fuel has shown the potential for reducing particulate (PM) emissions in the exhaust. The objective of this study was to select the most promising oxygenate compounds as blending components in diesel fuel for advanced engine testing. A fuel matrix was designed to consider the effect of molecular struc- ture and boiling point on the ability of oxygenates to reduce engine- out exhaust emissions from a modern diesel engine. Nine test fuels including a low-sulfur (~1 ppm), low-aromatic hydrocracked base fuel and 8 oxygenate-base fuel blends were utilized. All oxygenated fuels were formulated to contain 7% wt. of oxygen. A Daimler- Chrysler OM61 1 CIDI engine for light-duty vehicles was controlled with a SwRI Rapid Prototyping Electronic Control System. The base fuel was evaluated in four speed-load modes and oxygenated blends only in one mode. Each operating mode and fuel combina- tion was run in triplicate. The Bosch smoke number, total PM, total volatile fraction (TVF), NOx, CO, THC, CO2, and O2 were mea- sured. Dry PM, which is assumed to form during the combustion process, was calculated by subtracting the TVF from the total PM. PM emissions reductions were proportional to the oxygen content of the fuel, averaging 26.1 percent below that of base fuel. Spread in the dry PM emissions indicated that fuel properties other than oxygen content play a role in the soot formation mechanism. In some cases, NOx emissions can increase significantly. Based on Total PM emissions and other considerations, Tripropylene Glycol Mono-Methyl Ether and Di Butyl Maleate were identified as the most promising candidate oxygenate compounds for future engine testing. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3633. (SP- 1647) Utilization of sunflower methyl ester as a diesel engine fuel. Zafer Dulger, Kocaeli University Asim Kocabiyik Technical Vocational School ; and Cafer Kaplan, Uludag Univ. In this study, utilization of methyl ester obtained from raw sun- flower oil as a diesel engine fuel is investigated. In order to deter- mine performance and emissions characteristics of methyl ester fuel in comparison to those of pure diesel fuel, a series of tests were per- formed on a 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, 55 kW direct injection diesel engine. The diesel engine was run at full load and at various speeds with both pure diesel fuel and sunflower oil methyl ester. Torque, power, specific fuel consumption, soot, HC and CO emissions were measured for each fuel. The results show that sunflower methyl ester could be used as an alternate fuel in diesel engines. 2001-01-3634. (SP-1647) Effects of fuel injection characteris- tics on heat release and emissions in a DI diesel engine operated on DME. Yoshio Sato and Akira Nöda, National Traffic Safety and Environment Laboratory ; and Li Jun, Jilin Univ. In this study, an experimental investigation was conducted using a direct injection single-cylinder diesel engine equipped with a test common-rail fuel injection system to clarify how dimethyl ether (DME) injection characteristics affect the heat release and exhaust emissions. For that purpose the common-rail fuel injection system (injection pressure: 15 MPa) and injection nozzle (0.55 x 5-holes, 0.70 x 3-holes, same total holes area) have been used for the test. First, to characterize the effect of DME physical properties on the macro- scopic spray behavior: injection quantity, injection rate, penetration, cone angle, volume were measured using high-pressure injection chamber (pressure: 4MPa). In order to clarify effects of the injection process on HC, CO, and NOx emissions, as well as the rate of heat release were investigated by single-cylinder engine test. The effects of the injection rate and swirl ratio on exhaust emissions and heat release were also investigated. Those two parts of the study (injection test and single-cylinder engine test) showed that the 5-hole injection nozzle has faster atom- ization and quicker vaporization around the spray core. It promotes premixed combustion but results in greater HC and CO emissions when a large quantity of fuel is injected. With the 3-hole injection nozzle, at the beginning of the spray development, showed a little longer spray penetration, wider spray angle and bigger spray volume than that of the 5-hole nozzle. It takes time to form the fuel atomiza- 443</page><page sequence="443">2001-01-3634 - 2001-01-3641 tion, which inhibits premixed combustion and results in an increase of unburned components at small quantity of fuel injection. With the 3-hole injection nozzle, a higher injection rate results in a longer ignition delay, allowing spray to be distributed in a com- bustion chamber more extensively. A higher injection rate shows shorter combustion duration and improved cycle efficiency. When a large quantity of fuel is injected, an increase in swirl ratio enhances spray distribution and air-fuel mixture, therefore contrib- uting to the reduction of HC and CO emissions with the 5-hole injection nozzle in particular. Due to the difference in injection and combustion process of the nozzles, at a large quantity of fuel injec- tion, the 3-hole injection nozzle with an equivalent energy consump- tion rate of the 5-hole injection nozzle results in less NOx emissions. 2001-01-3635.

Li Jun , Jilin Univ.; and Yoshio Sato and Akira Nöda , National Traffic Safety and Environment Laboratory. In this study, the spray characteristics and evaporating processes of DME fuel were investigated using the Schlieren optical system and single-hole injectors in a constant volume chamber at room tem- perature. The photographs taken at different chamber pressures, injection pressures, orifice diameters and injection quantities were compared and analyzed. The results show that DME spray has a slower penetrating speed, wider spray angle, and much quicker evaporating processes than the diesel spray. 2001-01-3636.

Insu kim, POSCO ; Gisoo Hyun and Shinichi Goto, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science &amp; Technol- ogy ; and Ryoji Ehara, Nihon Univ. Spray characteristics of biodiesel oil was investigated as it can be applied to industrial combustion systems, including internal com- bustion engines. Shadowgraph methodology using Greenfield sys- tem was used to take some images of the spray and to measure drop- let size. A high-speed video camera was also used to take a picture of spray penetration and its angle. From the results, it shows that DME-blended biodiesel oil has almost the same droplet size as con- ventional diesel oil, when the blended DME ratio is over 50% by weight. It is also shown that there exists optimum fuel injection pressure that has minimum droplet size when the ambient gas pres- sure is constant. 2001-01-3637. Development of relevant work-cycles and emission factors for off-road machines. Olle Norén and Ola Fet- ter sson, JTI - Swedish Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering. The total amount of exhaust emissions from diesel en-gines all over the world must be reduced. Off-road machines consume a con- siderable part of the diesel fuel used in Sweden and much of the exhaust emissions originate from these machines. Consequently, it is urgent to study different methods to reduce fuel consumption and the exhaust emissions from off-road machines. The test-cycles used to calculate exhaust emissions from off-road machines are devel- oped for heavy on-road vehicles, e.g., trucks and busses. A pilot study at JTI indicates that calculation of the amount of emission based on these test-cycles may give completely wrong figures. More relevant test-cycles have to be established. The objectives of the project presented in this paper are: To study driving and load patterns in different field operations and transports using all kinds of off-road vehicles; To generate data on emissions as a base for calcu-lations of emissions from different field opera- tions and transports by off-road vehicles; To develop relevant static and transient load cycles; To establish emission factors for different operations through measurements of emissions and computer simu- lation; To propose methods in order to decrease fuel consumption and emissions; To generate data concerning fuel consumption for different operations. The studies are carried out partly in the field and partly in test stands. The field studies comprise contractor machines such as load- ers, excavators, haulers, forest machines like harvesters and for- warders, tractors with different implements, working machines and vehicles for farm operations. In the field studies, the machines are equipped with sensors and data collecting systems for fuel consump- tion, engine speed, forward speed slip, temperatures of fuels, etc. The emissions are measured in engine test stands because this requires a laboratory for that type of measurement. The project is conducted by: JTI - Swedish Institute of Agricul- tural and Environmental Engineering; Department of Agricultural Engineering, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Skog- Forsk, The Forestry Research Institute of Swe-den; The Swedish National Road Administration, Construction and Maintenance; SMP, The Swedish Machinery Testing Institute; and Luleã Univer- sity of Technology 2001-01-3638. Emission and fuel consumption measurements for transit buses running on gaseous fuels using a mobile mea- surement system. Markku Ikonen, Marten Westerholm, and Nils- OlofNylund, Technical Research Center of Finland (VTT Energy). The emissions of heavy-duty engines have traditionally been measured in Europe by using steady-state engine dynamo-meter tests. However, several studies have proved that emissions of real stop-and-go driving are much higher than the steady-state results indicate. In this study, a mobile measurement system, located inside a vehicle, was utilized. The emissions and energy consumption of dif- ferent gaseous fuel powered transit buses were measured by using two duty cycles, and the results were compared with diesel technol- ogy. The results indicated that NOx emissions of gaseous fuels were in the range of 30-90% lower than diesel, depending on vehicle tech- nology and fuel. However, energy consumption of gaseous fuels was found to be around 20-45 % higher than in the case of diesel. 2001-01-3640. Interpreting remote-sensing NOx measure- ments: At low load near Chicago 1997-1999, and at high and low load sites on the same ramp in Phoenix, 1999. Robert Slott, Con- sultant; and Sajal S. Pokharel and Donald H. Stedman, University of Denver. Remote-sensing nitric oxide (NO) measurements are difficult to analyze because load varies among on-road vehicles measured by remote sensing and NO emissions are dependent on load. Remote- sensing NO measurements were made on passenger cars in 1997, 1998, and 1999 in Chicago, EL, at a site where few vehicles had loads greater than those encountered in the FTP. Passenger car NO emissions could be modeled by an equation with an age term and a load term for measurements made under moderate load. Onset of decreasing NO emissions with increasing load was observed to occur at lower load for older technology vehicles. Light-duty vehi- cles were measured by remote sensing at two sites on the same ramp in Phoenix, AZ. A large proportion of the vehicles at one of the sites was under loads far in excess of those experienced in the FTP. NO could not be characterized by a single valued function of age and load for both Phoenix sites even though the fleet at the two sites was very similar. Reasons for this are discussed. 2001-01-3641.

Allsop , Clean Air Technologies International, Inc. To complement laboratory emissions tests and to obtain emis- sions data for events that are difficult to simulate, a portable, on- board mass exhaust emissions monitoring system has been devel- oped. The system utilizes NDIR for CO and CO2, an electrochemi- cal cell for NOx and laser light scattering detectors for PM real-time concentrations measurements. Exhaust flow is determined computa- tionally from engine operating data using mass balance equations. 444</page><page sequence="444">2001-01-3641-2001-01-3648 The system is designed to easily and quickly install on a large vari- ety of vehicles, including buses with passengers on board, and to produce a wealth of on-road data with minimal downtime and travel of the vehicle tested. 2001-01-3643. Measurement of in-use, on-board emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles: Mobile emissions measurement system. Mridul Gautam, Gregory J. Thompson , Daniel K. Carder , Nigel N. Clark, Benjamin C. Shade, Wesley C. Riddle, and Donald W. Lyons , West Virginia Univ. Emissions tests for heavy-duty diesel-fueled vehicles are nor- mally performed using an engine dynamometer or a chassis dyna- mometer. Both of these methods generally entail the use of laborato- ry-grade emissions measurement instrumentation, a CVS system, an environment control system, a dynamometer, and associated data acquisition and control systems. The results obtained from such tests provide a means by which engines may be compared to the emis- sions standards, but may not be truly indicative of an engine's in- vehióle performance while operating on the road. An alternative to such a testing methodology would be to actively record the emis- sions from a vehicle while it was operating on-road. A considerable amount of discussion has been focused on the development of on- road emissions measurement systems (OREMS) that would provide for such in-use emissions data collection. Discussed herein is a review of research related to previous in-field and on-board emis- sions measurement systems, as well as an overview of components that could be integrated to form an OREMS. Presented also is an OREMS that was developed by West Virginia University (WVU) to record in-use, brake-specific emissions from heavy-duty diesel- powered vehicles. Dubbed the Mobile Emissions Measurement Sys- tem, or MEMS, the unit is capable of reporting brake-specific mass emissions of CO2 and NOx over 30-second windows. The MEMS was developed as part of the work described by the Consent Decrees entered into by six heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers and the United States (US) government. Measurements of brake-specific NOx and CO2 recorded by the MEMS over an FTP test were found to be within 5% when compared to laboratory measurements. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3644. Development of the É RA VEM' ride-along vehi- cle emission measurement system for gaseous and particulate emissions. Christopher S. Weaver and Marco V. Balam-Almanza, Engine, Fuel, and Emissions Engineering, Incorporated. Emissions of particulate matter (PM) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from heavy-duty engines used in road vehicles and mobile equipment are of critical concern to air quality planners. Accurate measurement of these emissions is needed both for emission inven- tory purposes and for the development and validation of emission control measures. These emissions cannot adequately be predicted from laboratory tests on new engines. This paper reports the devel- opment of the Ride-Along Vehicle Emission Measurement (RA VEM) system. Based on the constant volume sampling (CVS) principle, the RA VEM system can accurately and repeatably mea- sure mass emissions of NOx, CO2, and PM from an engine exhaust pipe while 'riding along' on the vehicle or equipment under test. In most cases, this can be done without removing the vehicle from ser- vice. RA VEM test results have been shown to correlate very closely with those of conventional CVS emission laboratories. The RA VEM system is especially suited for measuring emissions where conventional chassis dynamometer emission test methods are not applicable (e.g., bulldozers, locomotives, marine vessels), not avail- able (e.g., most developing countries), or unrepresentative of real- world operations (e.g., garbage trucks). 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3645. (SP- 1640) Fuel distribution and combustion characteristics in a direct-injection, spark-ignited (DISI) engine under stratified operation. Simone Hochgreb, Sandia National Laboratories. The characteristics of the combustion process in direct-injected, spark-ignited (DISI), stratified-operation engines, are intimately related to the fiiel distribution in the combustion chamber. Engine performance, and particularly emissions of hydrocarbons, nitric oxides and particulate matter are strongly dependent on the manner in which the fuel charge is distributed. The present paper investi- gates the fuel distribution and combustion characteristics of a side- injected DISI engine under stratified operation and late injection, using optical diagnostics without compromising on the use of a real- istic bowl geometry. Laser-induced fluorescence, laser-induced elastic scatter and color and luminosity visualization are employed to identify the relationship between fuel distribution and combustion characteristics. The results show that the mixture is strongly strati- fied, with combustion starting primarily in the fuel-lean to stoichio- metric region surrounding the spark, followed by propagation into fuel-rich zones. Intense soot luminosity and particulate matter is observed in the fuel rich regions close to the piston throughout the expansion stroke. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3646. (SP- 1640) Liquid fuel impingement on the pis- ton bowl of a direct-injection, spark-ignited (DISI) engine under stratified operation. Simone Hochgreb, Sandia National Laborato- ries. The behavior of the liquid fuel impinging on the piston top of a direct-injected, spark-ignited (DISI) engine operating under strati- fied conditions is investigated using floodlight laser-induced fluo- rescence (LIF). The combustion chamber geometry offers wall- guided stratification using a high-pressure injector impinging on an inclined piston bowl. The LIF signal is collected through the bottom of the quartz piston, allowing observation of the footprint of the spray during and after spray development. Nitrogen gas is used to replace air in order to minimize oxygen quenching and increase the signal. The results show that at typical piston top temperatures expected in warmed-up operation (150-180°C), a liquid film and ring around the area where the fuel jet impinges is present through the time of spark (20° before top center). The presence of the fuel film is not very sensitive to the surface temperature. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3647. (SP- 1640) Investigations of mixture formation and combustion in gasoline direct injection engines. Heiko Kubach, Jörg Gindele, and Ulrich Spicher, Karlsruhe Univ. The spray propagation and disintegration is investigated in a pressure chamber. With Particle Image Velocimetry the direction and velocity of both, fuel droplets and induced gas flow are detected. By means of shadow photographs the spray cone geometry is visualized. To verify the predictions made of the measurements mentioned above and to rate the quality of the tuning of the parame- ters in-cylinder gas flow, injection pressure, position of Injector and position of spark plug under real engine conditions, a fast gas sam- pling valve is used in three different engines. The in-cylinder gas temperature and the soot concentration are measured crank angle resolved by means of the Two-Color-Method in a 1 -cylinder GDI- engine. The soot concentration and temperature show the influence of the injection pressure on emissions like soot and nitric oxide. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3648.

Basic in-cylinder phenomena, such as the formation of the flow field, the penetration of the spray formed by a hollow-cone swirl-type injector at high fuel pressure, the interac- tion of spray and flow and the formation of an ignitable mixture were analysed in details. 445</page><page sequence="445">2001-01-3648-2001-01-3654 The paper describes the laser-optical techniques - particle-image- velocimetry, laser-doppler-anemometry, video-stroboscopy, high- speed filming and laser-induced fluorescence - which were used during the development of the DI gasoline combustion process. In addition, CFD simulations have been carried out simultaneously with the experiments, thus providing the engine designer with com- plete information about the in-cylinder processes to derive further steps of optimization. Results taken from engines with optical access to the combustion chamber demonstrate the capability of the aforementioned techniques and pinpoint where the design of the combustion process benefits from experimental and simulation investigations. 2001-01-3649. (SP- 1640) Flame structure visualization of stratified combustion in a DISI Engine via PLIF. T. E. Strand, D.A. Rothamer, and J. B. Ghandhi, University of Wisconsin. Planar laser-induced fluorescence of 3-pentanone doped into the fuel (iso-octane) and OH, which is present in the combustion prod- ucts, was performed in an optically accessible direct-injection spark- ignition (DISI) engine under stratified and homogeneous operating conditions. A wall-guided, swirl-based combustion chamber was utilized, and experiments were performed for light load, where the fuel-air equivalence ratio was 0.3, and high load conditions, with an equivalence ratio of 0.7, at speeds of 600 and 1200 rpm. The 3-pen- tanone images were calibrated through the use of a premixed charge condition of known equivalence ratio, with corrections applied for number density changes due to combustion. At the light load condi- tion combustion of the highly stratified fuel cloud was directly mea- sured for the first time. The equivalence ratio of the mixture at the flame front was found to be in the range from 0.5 - 0.8 for optimized combustion conditions in this engine. Large gradients were observed in the fuel distribution throughout combustion. Images acquired in the expansion stroke well past the end of the main heat release showed the continued presence of 3-pentanone in the end gas with an equivalence ratio near 0.4, suggesting the lean quenching of the flame. Under all operating conditions there was a weak corre- lation between the fuel distribution near the spark gap at the time of ignition and the combustion performance on a cycle-by-cycle basis. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3650. (SP-1640) Fuel volatility effects on mixture preparation and performance in a GDI engine during cold start. Kun Tong, Bryan D. Quay, James V. Zello, and Domenie A. San- tavicca, Pennsylvania State Univ. The objective of this research was to characterize the effects of fuel component volatility on gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine cold start. Three different fuel components, representing gasoline light end, mid-point and heavy end components, were used to form three fuel blends of different volatility. Performance tests and in- cylinder fuel distribution imaging tests using these fuel blends were carried out in a firing single-cylinder optically-accessible engine fol- lowing a simulated cold-start test schedule. Performance results, based on in-cylinder pressure and engine-out hydrocarbon measure- ments, during the initial transient phase of GDI cold-start showed significantly degraded performance with the low volatility fuel blend, while the high volatility blend showed slightly improved per- formance. Neither the low nor high volatility fuel, however, showed a discernable effect on the quasi-steady-state, cold-start perfor- mance. Simultaneous planar laser-induced fluorescence and Mie scattering images showed that fuel volatility affects spray develop- ment and fuel-air mixing and as a result the in-cylinder fuel distribu- tion. In particular, high-volatility components, because they vapor- ize more quickly, result in smaller drops, which have less penetra- tion; whereas, low volatility components, because they vaporize more slowly, result in larger drops, which have greater penetration and as a result are more likely to impinge on the cylinder walls. The increased wall wetting that occurs with low-volatility fuels effec- tively reduces the equivalence ratio, causing the poor cold-start per- formance observed with the low-volatility fuel blend. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3652.

Fussell , Institute of Science, Ecology, and the Envi- ronment; John Daily, Jackson Hole Scientific Investigations ; How- ard Haines, Montana Department of Environmental Quality; Steve Roseberry, Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality; and Jeff J. White, Southwest Research Institute. In response to increasing concern about snowmobile noise and air pollution, Teton County Wyoming Commissioner Bill Paddle- ford and environmental engineer Dr. Lori Fussell worked with The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Institute of Sci- ence, Ecology, and the Environment (ISEE) to organize an intercol- legiate design competition, the SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge (SAE CSC). The goal of the SAE CSC was to encourage development of a snowmobile with improved emission and noise characteristics that does not sacrifice performance. Modifications were expected to be cost effective and practical. The second year of the competition, the SAE CSC2001, was held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming from March 24 - 30, 2001. Major spon- sors of the SAE CSC2001 included the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Flagg Ranch Resort, Montana Department 6f Environmental Quality, Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, Teton County Wyoming, Peaks to Prairies Pollution Prevention Information Center, United States Department of Energy, and West- Start. Those participating in the event competed against each other in the categories of emissions, fuel economy/range, noise, accelera- tion, handling, cold start, hill climb, engineering design paper, oral presentation, cost minimization, and static display. Points were awarded to teams based on their performance in each of the events. The University of Waterloo won the SAE CSC2001 with a snow- mobile featuring a two-stroke engine with catalytic aftertreatment and a custom silencer. This first-place entry was successful at reduc- ing noise and emissions while simultaneously improving fuel econ- omy and maintaining adequate performance. It was a reliable entry, successfully completing and passing all competition events. 2001-01-3653. (SP-1649) Development of a snowmobile to address concerns of exhaust and noise emissions. Jason Hanam, Andy Punkari, Mike Kuntz, Brad Roth, Bill McMaster, Andrew Ma, May Leung, Ken Ku, Jason Halayko, Will Chang, and Roydon Fra- ser, University of Waterloo. This paper describes the design strategy and procedure followed by the University of Waterloo's Team Eco-Snow in order to partici- pate in the Clean Snowmobile Challenge 2001. The team's objec- tives are to engineer a clean, quiet snowmobile that provides recre- ational users with a more environmentally responsible vehicle while maintaining or exceeding the performance of current production snowmobiles. The design strategy followed includes the active development of two separate alternatives powered by both a two- stroke and a four-stroke engine. Each of these solutions was ana- lyzed and modifications performed to meet the goals of the competi- tion and of the team. Finally, the extent to which each alternative met these goals was evaluated. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3654. (SP-1649) The design and implementation of Kettering University's entry into the 2001 Clean Snowmobile Challenge. Kyle Schwulst, Edward Heil, Jeremy Taylor, and Greg- ory W. Davis, Kettering Univ.

A four-stroke Daihatsu 659cc turbocharged engine was installed into a Yamaha V-max 600 snow- mobile. Several modifications to both the engine and to the sled were done to maximize the performance of the two systems when they are merged together. The overall performance of the sled is comparable to that of the stock snowmobile. Acceleration is slightly less than the OEM snow- mobile, and mass was added to the front of the sled which decreased the handling ability. This is offset, however, by the drastic reduction of harmful exhaust emissions and also by the reduction in the sound level of the sled. This snowmobile was designed with maintenance and durability in mind. The changes in technology are not apparent to the snowmo- bile operator, as the snowmobile retains all of the stock snowmobile controls and features. The cost of the snowmobile is estimated as only a slight increase from OEM, as only fully developed technol- ogy was used. 2001-01-3655. (SP- 1649) Reducing the emissions and noise of a turbocharged, four-stroke snowmobile. Andrew Mills , Eric Baker , Daniel Drake , Adam Echter, Nick Ferraro, and Nicholas Mills, University at Buffalo SAE Clean Snowmobile Team. The objective of this project is to modify an existing snowmobile to reduce emissions and noise while maintaining or improving per- formance. Existing technologies and commercially available prod- ucts from various engineering fields have been combined to create a finished product that suits the objectives. Intake, engine, exhaust and body modifications have been made, such as high flow filters, ceramic coatings, turbocharger, catalytic after-treatment, cowl design, and implementation of an engine management system. The finished product is an easily manufactured snowmobile that meets these objectives and can be used in National Parks and other envi- ronmentally sensitive areas. 2001-01-3656. (SP- 1649) Making the connection: The Univer- sity of Idaho clean snowmobile. Phil Auth, Seth Millhorn, and Zack Beeler, University of Idaho; and Karen R. Den Braven, Uni- versity Of Idaho. The goals of the 2001 University of Idaho clean snowmobile team were to reduce snowmobile exhaust and sound emissions while maximizing fuel efficiency and performance. The competition snowmobile consists of a four-stroke BMW K75RT motorcycle engine mounted into a 2001 model ArcticCat SnoPro chassis. A spe- cial motor mount was designed to attach the engine to the chassis, and special carriage developed to match the primary clutch to the engine. A custom exhaust system consisting of a single-stage cata- lyst and muffler was designed to control hydrocarbon and noise pro- duction. Modified electrical and fuel pumping systems were imple- mented to maintain the stock fuel injection system. 2001-01-3657.

Wegleitner, Michigan Technological Univ. The successful implementation of a clean, quiet, four-stroke engine into an existing snowmobile chassis has been achieved. The snowmobile is easy to start, easy to drive and environmentally friendly. The following paper describes the conversion process in detail with actual engine test data. The hydrocarbon emissions of the new, four-stroke snowmobile are 98% lower than current, produc- tion, two-stroke models. The noise production of the four-stroke snowmobile was 68 dBA during an independent wide-open throttle acceleration test. If the four-stroke snowmobile were to replace all current, two-stroke snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), the vehicles would only produce 16% of the combined auto- mobile and snowmobile hydrocarbon emissions compared to the current 93% produced by two-stroke snowmobiles. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3659.

The University of Alberta Clean Snowmobile Challenge Team modified a 1998 Polaris XCR 440 Snowmobile to compete in the 2001 SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge (CSC). A modified fuel- injected four-stroke Suzuki GSX-R600 engine and a custom exhaust system were installed to reduce the emissions and the noise emitted from the snowmobile. The objectives of the CSC competition were to reduce the hydrocarbon emissions by at least 50% and emitted a noise level below 74 dBA at 50 ft and at wide open throttle (WOT). 2001-01-3661. (SP- 1649) An approach to clean snowmobile design: Implementation of a 4-cycle low-emission vehicle engine. Edwin Dale Hahn, University of Alaska Fairbanks. The purpose of this document is to give the reader brief insight into the basic concepts, principles, and reasoning as applied to envi- ronmentally sensitive snowmobile design. Although a snowmobile is a conglomeration of multiple systems and components, the focus of this article shall be upon the design of components that form the foundation for a successful Clean Snowmobile Challenge entry -the powerplant. This paper briefly covers the conceptual design process, and a rationalized powerplant solution for a clean, quiet snowmo- bile. In addition, a detailed description of a four-stroke, three- cylinder powerplant implementation and the required modifications to an Arctic Cat snowmobile chassis are included. The results of the modified snowmobile's performance at the Clean Snowmobile Challenge 2001 are visited. In general, the overall performance of the modified snowmobile was satisfactory; its strengths are: reliabil- ity, robust construction, aesthetic appearance, and noise suppres- sion. The article concludes with an explanation of strategies for maintaining snowmobile performance, reducing noise and exhaust emissions, improving fuel economy and analyzing durability with the LEV engine solution. The information presented herein is derived from the knowledge, experience and rationale of the 2001 University of Alaska Clean Snowmobile Challenge Team, a sub- part of the University of Alaska Society of Automotive Engineers (UAFSAE). 2001-01-3662. (SP- 1644) A comparison of steady, pulsating flow measurements and CFD simulations in close coupled cata- lysts. A. Arias-García, S. F. Benjamin, and H. Zhao, Coventry Univ.; and S. Farr, ArvinMeritor Ltd. Performance improvements of automotive catalytic converters can be achieved by improving the flow distribution of exhaust gases within the substrate. The flow distribution is often assumed to be adequately described by measurements obtained from steady flow rigs. An experimental study was carried out to characterize the flow distribution through the substrate of a close-coupled catalytic con- verter for both steady and pulsating conditions on a flow rig and on a motored engine. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were also performed. On the flow rig, the flow from each port was activated separately discharging air to different regions of the sub- strate. This resulted in a high degree of flow maldistribution. For steady flow maldistribution increased with Reynolds number. Pul- sating the flow resulted in a reduction in flow maldistribution. Dif- ferent flow distributions were observed on the motored engine when compared to composite maps derived from the rig. For the engine study significantly more flow activity was observed at the periphery of the substrate, each port contributing to the net flow. The results suggest that strong port interactions occur. CFD simulations showed qualitative agreement with measurements but underestimated the flow maldistribution. 2001-01-3663. (SP- 1644) Designed experiment to evaluate the canning strength of various high cell density/ ultra-thin-wall ceramic monoliths. Stephen Myers, John Boehnke , and Gerald L. Vaneman, Delphi Automotive. 447</page><page sequence="447">2001-01-3663-2001-01-3668 High cell density (HCD) (&gt; 600 cpsi) and/or ultra-thin-wall (UTW) (&lt; 4 mil) extruded ceramic monolith substrates are being used in many new automotive catalyst applications because they offer (1) increased geometric surface area, (2) lower thermal mass, (3) increased open frontal area and (4) higher heat and mass transfer rates. Delphi has shown in previous papers how to use the effective- ness, NTU theory, to optimize the various benefits of these HCD / UTW catalysts. A primary disadvantage of these low solid fraction substrates is their reduced structural strength, as measured by a 3-D hydrostatic (isostatic) test. The weakest of these new substrates is only 10 to 20% as strong as standard 400 x 6.5 substrates. Improved converter assembly methods with lower, more uniform forces will likely be required to successfully assemble converters with such weak sub- strates in production. To investigate this issue, Delphi arranged with NGK, Corning and ASEC to undertake a cooperative study based on a designed experiment using robust engineering principles. Nominally 400 x 3.5, 600 x 3.5, 900 x 2.5, and 1200 x 2.5 substrates were washcoated with high and low loadings of a ceria- or a non-ceria-containing washcoat. The bricks were tested to destruction using either a stuff- ing apparatus or a tourniquet apparatus using Tekscan film to mea- sure failure pressures and their uniformity. This initial report describes the sample details and the preliminary results from the twenty-eight stuffed parts. 2001-01-3664. (SP- 1644) Integration of engine controls, exhaust components and advanced catalytic converters for ULEV and SULEV applications. Mano j K. Karwa, Ricardo , Inc.; Frederick B. Hill, Jr. and John P. Biel, Benteler Automotive Corp.; and Mark Mark Crocker, dmc2 Degussa Metal Catalysts Cerdee Corp. Development of integrated engine controls, exhaust components and advanced catalytic converters was demonstrated on a 1998 full- size luxury sedan with a gasoline PFI 4.4 L V8 engine. This level of emissions management was targeted for ULEV and SULEV emission standards. An air gap, dual exhaust, six-catalyst system, was modified in stages to reduce the number of catalysts and associ- ated controls/hardware. Engine controls and calibration were devel- oped to reduce cold-start emissions, catalyst light-off time and tail- pipe emissions. Systems integration involved reduced precious metal loading, secondary AIR and modification of emission control devices. The thermal mass of the air gap exhaust pipes was reduced by approximately 30 percent, which contributed to improved cata- lyst heat-up time. A vacuum-insulated catalytic converter with phase change material was used to store exhaust heat and resist heat loss during times of dwell/soak. FTP-75 tests typically included two LA4 preparation cycles prior to soak. Upon engine start, the catalyst was at an elevated temperature, thereby reducing cold-start emis- sions. Catalyst start temperatures, which are a function of prep cycle and soak times, were studied. 2001-01-3665. (SP- 1644) NOx storage and reduction on dif- ferentiated chemistry catalysts for lean gasoline vehicles. T. Maunula, A. Vakkilainen, R. Heikkinen, and M. Härkönen, Kemira Metalkat. NOx storage and reduction (NSR) catalysts are a widely investi- gated solution for lean gasoline applications. Open coating on metallic substrates gives a new opportunity to combine low and high temperature NSR catalysts into a converter by using differentiated chemistry on separate foils. A wide operation window for NOx con- version between 200-600°C was reached with alumina based NSR catalyst in appropriate conditions. Differentiation on separate foils can be made by NOx adsorption compounds, active metals (Pt, Rh), exhaust gas conditions or desulfation strategy. The desulfation, par- ticularly from potassium-containing high temperature NSR cata- lysts, was decreased by 100°C by the addition of a small amount of TÍO2. The combination of 3-way and NSR catalyst was designed by the size and lean-rich timings in laboratory and engine conditions. Low OSC PdRh (7:1) catalysts with higher loadings were used as 3-way catalysts. 2001-01-3666. (SP- 1644) Bench scale NOx trap system for die- sel applications. Christian Kiinkel and C. U. Ingemar Odenbrand, Lund Univ. A NOx storage and reduction approach addresses NOx emissions from mobile diesel sources. A bench scale rig system has been con- structed, allowing experiments with real diesel exhaust gases under well-defined conditions. The system consists of a 50 cm3 NOx stor- age and reduction catalyst located in a temperature controlled oven, and has the possibility of adding reducing agents, both gaseous (i.e., propene) and liquid diesel-like (e.g., heptane), into the gas stream upstream of the catalyst to subsequently react with NOx on the cata- lyst. A similar laboratory scale system, using a 6 cm3 NOx storage and reduction catalyst, has been used with synthetic gases of diesel exhaust-like composition, with the possibility to add a gaseous reducing agent. Factorial NOx storage and reduction experiments have been per- formed in the two systems. Results from the investigations and sta- tistical analysis thereof show which parallels can be drawn between laboratory scale and bench scale systems regarding adsorption and reduction of NOx in a relevant temperature range. Similarities and divergences of results using different reducing agents or catalyst set- ups in the application are discussed. The investigations show the possibility to use the NOx storage approach for diesel vehicles and the potential principles of operation in full-scale systems. The con- sequences of these operation principles in terms of NOx removal efficiency relative to fuel consumption increase are elucidated. 2001-01-3667. (SP- 1640) Modeling of DISI engine sprays with comparison to experimental in-cylinder spray images. Zhiyu Han, Zheng Xu, Steven T. Wooldridge, Jianwen Yi, and George Lav- oie, Ford Motor Co. In modeling of engine fuel-air mixing, it is desired to be able to predict fuel spray atomization under different injection and ambient conditions. In this work, a previously developed sheet atomization model was studied for this purpose. For sprays from a pressure-swirl injector, it is assumed in the model that the fuel flows out the injec- tor forming a conical liquid film (sheet), and the sprays are formed due to the disintegration of the sheet. Modified formulations are pro- posed to estimate sheet parameters including sheet thickness and velocity at the nozzle exit. It was found that the fuel flow rate of a swirl injector satisfied the correlation well. Computations of the sprays injected in an engine with a side-mounted injector were per- formed for conditions that duplicated a set of experiments per- formed in an optical engine. The computed results were compared with the spray images obtained from the optical engine using elastic (Mie) scattering. Both early and late injection schemes were studied and fairly good agreement between computation and experiment was obtained. It was found that in this particular engine configura- tion the spray was lifted from its axis toward the chamber roof at the late injection mode while it was deflected from its axis in an opposite direction for the early injection mode. Analysis of the mod- eling indicated that these phenomena were related to the compli- cated spray and gas flow interactions. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3668.

Analysis of flow field and charge distribution in a gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engine is performed by a modified version of the KIVA code. A particle-based spray model is proposed to simu- late a swirl-type hollow-cone spray in a GDI engine. Spray droplets are assumed to be fully atomized and introduced at the sheet breakup locations as determined by experimental correlations and energy conservation. The effects of the fuel injection parameters 448</page><page sequence="448">2001-01-3668-2001-01-3675 such as spray cone angle and ambient pressure are examined for dif- ferent injectors and injection conditions. Results show reasonable agreement with the measurements for penetration, dispersion, global shape, droplet velocity and size distribution by Phase Doppler Parti- cle Anemometry (PDP A) in a constant-volume chamber. The test engine is a 4-stroke, 4-valve optically accessible single-cylinder engine with a pent-roof head and tumble ports. Parametric study is performed with respect to the fuel injection timing, spray cone angle and injector position. It is shown that the current numerical methods are capable of reproducing the proper qualitative trend of mixture distribution against visualization images by pulsed-laser Mie scattering. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3669. (SP- 1640) 3-D PIV analysis of structural behavior of D.I. gasoline spray. Masahisa Yamakawa, Seiji Isshiki, Jeekuen Lee , and Keiya Nishida, University of Hiroshima. Three-dimensional behaviors of direct injection (D.I.) gasoline sprays were investigated using 2-D and 3-D particle image veloci- metry (PIV) techniques. The fuel was injected with a swirl-type injector for D.I. gasoline engines into a constant volume chamber in which ambient pressure was varied from 0.1 to 0.4 MPa at room temperature. The spray was illuminated by a laser light sheet gener- ated by a double-pulsed NdiYAG laser (wave length: 532 nm) and the succeeding two tomograms of the spray were taken by a high- resolution CCD camera. The 2-D and 3-D velocity distributions of the droplet cloud in the spray were calculated from these tomograms by using the PIV technique. The effects of the swirl groove flows in the injector and the ambient pressure on the structural behavior of the droplet cloud in the spray were also examined. In the vertical tomograms of the spray including the spray axis, large-scale vortices are found in the peripheries of the spray and their scales are decreased with an increase in the ambient pressure. In the horizontal tomograms of the spray normal to the spray axis, it was found that the spray did not penetrate uniformly in the radial direction, and the irregular shape of the spray periphery is supposedly related to the swirl groove flows in the injector. The PIV results show that the spray flow consists of irregular flows including forward and reverse flow areas, which are not the simple rotating bulk motion. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3670. (SP- 1640) Investigation of augmented mixing effects on direct-injection stratified combustion. B. A. McGuire , Mercury Marine division of Brunswick Corp.; and J. B. Ghandhi , University of Wisconsin. The effects of augmented mixing through the use of an auxiliary gas injection (AGI) were investigated in a direct-injection gasoline engine operated at a 22:1 overall air-fuel ratio, but with retarded injection timing such that the combustion was occurring in a locally rich mixture as evident by the elevated CO emissions. Two AGI gas compositions, nitrogen and air, were utilized, the gas supply temper- ature was ambient, and a wide range of AGI timings were investi- gated. The injected mass was less than 10% of the total chamber mass. The injection of nitrogen during the latter portion of the heat release phase resulted in a 25% reduction in the CO emissions. This reduction is considered to be the result of the increased mixing rate of the rich combustion products with the available excess air during a time when the temperatures are high enough to promote rapid oxi- dation. This CO reduction was achieved despite the fact that the injected gas had a low temperature and was inert, both attributes should result in reduced oxidation rates. The effect of temperature and composition were observed by a significant reduction in the NOx emissions at the same conditions, confirming that the AGI ori- entation was effecting changes in the high temperature in-cylinder processes. At the same conditions air AGI (i.e, an oxidizing gas) produced a more significant CO reduction, and the oxygen content counteracted the low temperature to cause no change in the NOx emissions. These findings suggest that a lack of late-cycle mixing limits the emissions potential of current direct-injection engines. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3671.

Specific fuel consumption and engine-out emissions have been investigated for both homogeneous and strati- fied modes of fuel injection. Trends in performance with varying AFR, EGR, spark and injection timings have been explored. It is shown that neural networks can be trained to describe these trends accurately for even the most complex case of stratified charge oper- ation with exhaust gas recirculation. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3672. (SP-1640) DISI engine spark and fuel injection timings - Effects, compromise and robustness. P. J. Shayler, S. T. Jones, and G. Horn, University of Nottingham; and D. Eade, Ford Motor Co. DISI engine emissions and fuel economy are strongly dependent upon fuel injection and spark timings, particularly when the engine is operating in stratified charge mode. Experimental studies of the effects of injection and spark timings and the interaction between these are described. The sensitivity of HC and NOx emissions to timings during stratified charge operation, the comparison of perfor- mance under stratified and homogeneous charge modes of operation and the rationale for mode switch point settings are investigated. The high sensitivity of emissions to injection and spark timing set- tings gives rise to potential robustness issues. These are described. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3673. (SP- 1641) Diesel soot oxidation under con- trolled conditions. H. Song, N. Ladommatos, and H. Zhao, Brunei Univ. A quantitative relationship between diesel soot oxidation rate and oxidation temperature and oxygen partial pressure was investigated by burning the diesel exhaust soot particles in a controlled flat flame supplied with methane/air/oxygen/nitrogen mixtures. The oxidation temperature and the oxygen partial pressure were controlled in the ranges of 1530 to 1820 K and 0.01 to 0.05 atm (latm = 1.01325 bar), respectively. Soot particle size distribution measurements were achieved with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for particle samples that were collected on copper grids at different positions along the flame centerline. Oxidation periods were determined by means of laser doppler anemometry (LDA). The experimental results showed that the experimental oxidation rates fall between the values predicted by the Nagle and Strickland-Constable formula and those by the Lee formula. 2001-01-3675. (SP- 1641) Emissions modeling of heavy-duty conventional and hybrid electric vehicles. Nigel N. Clark, Jason Conley, Ronald P. Jarrett, Anajli Nennelli, and Csaba Tóth-Nagy, West Virginia Univ. Today's computer-based vehicle operation simulators use engine speed, engine torque, and lookup tables to predict emissions during a driving simulation. This approach is used primarily for light- and medium-duty vehicles, with large discrepancies inherently due to the lack of transient engine emissions data and inaccurate emissions prediction methods. West Virginia University (WVU) has devel- oped an artificial neural network (ANN)-based emissions model for incorporation into the ADvanced Vehicle SimulatOR (ADVISOR) software package developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Transient engine dynamometer tests were con- ducted to obtain training data for the ANN. The ANN was trained to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emis- sions based on engine speed, torque, and their representative first and second derivatives over various time ranges. Conventional and hybrid vehicles were simulated in ADVISOR and the vehicle's emissions were predicted by the ANN emissions model based on simulated engine speed and torque. The results were compared with actual emissions data obtained from similar vehicles exercised 449</page><page sequence="449">200 1 -0 1 -3675-200 1 -0 1 -3680 through transient chassis tests conducted by the WVU Transportable Heavy-Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratory (THDVETL).

(SP- 1641) Effects of an on-line bypass oil recy- cler on emissions with oil age for a bus using in-service testing. Gordon E. Andrews and Hu Li, University of Leeds; and J. Hall, A. A. Rahman, and P. Mawson, Top High UK Ltd. A method of cleaning lubricating oil on-line was investigated using a fine bypass particulate filter followed by an infrared heater. Two bypass filter sizes of 6 and 1 micron were investigated, both filter sizes were effective but the one micron filter had the greatest benefit. This was tested on two nominally identical EURO 2 emis- sions compliance single-decker buses, fitted with Cummins 6-cylin- der 8.3-liter turbocharged intercooled engines and coded as Bus 4063 and 4070. These vehicles had emissions characteristics that were significantly different, in spite of their similar age and total mileage. Bus 4063 showed an apparent deterioration on emissions with time while Bus 4070 showed a stabilized trend on emissions with time for their baseline tests without the recycler fitted. Compar- ison was made with the emissions on the same vehicles and engines with and without the on-line bypass oil recycler. Engine exhaust emissions were measured about every 2000 miles. All tests started with an oil drain and fresh lubricating oil. The two buses were tested in a different sequence, Bus 4063 with the recycler fitted and then removed later in the test after an oil change and Bus 4070 with no recycler fitted at first and then fitted after 29,000 miles with no oil change. The Bus 4070 was also the one with the finer bypass filter. The test mileage was 45,000 miles for Bus 4063 and 48,000 miles for Bus 4070. The air/fuel ratio was worked out by the exhaust gas analysis. The correlation between air/fuel ratio and emission param- eters was determined. The results showed that the on-line oil recy- cler cleaning system reduced the rate of increase of the NOx from 5% to 1.6% for Bus 4063 and from 4.1% to 0% for Bus 4070 per 10,000 miles. Hydrocarbon emissions increased 30 ppm per 10,000 miles with the recycler removed compared to a stabilized level with the recycler fitted for Bus 4063. There was a small decrease in hydrocarbon emissions after fitting the recycler for Bus 4070. The particulate emissions were reduced by 35% for Bus 4063 and 24% for Bus 4070 on average. The reductions on total particulate mass were due to reductions on particulate carbon and lube oil VOF emis- sions. The black smoke was reduced by 56% for Bus 4063 in terms of rate of increase and 40% for Bus 4070 in terms of average values. 2001-01-3678. (SP- 1647) Emissions performance of in-use alternative fuel vehicles. Jimmy Wang, Dave Gourley, and Stephen Stewart, Wuhan University of Technology. A new type of dual-fuel supply system has been developed. This system is able to economically convert conventional diesel engines into dual-fuel engines like LPG/diesel engines and CNG/diesel engines, which are capable of either using single diesel fuel or using dual-fuel including both diesel and CNG fuel or both diesel and LPG fuel. These diesel-LPG engines have been applied to the diesel buses in the public transportation of Guangzhou city, one of the biggest cities in China, owning to their low soot emissions, excellent operat- ing performances and extremely low cost as well. Compared with the diesel baseline engine, it was found that there were a significant reduction in soot emission and an improvement of the fuel consumption with the diesel-LPG engine. Also the strat- egy on LPG content is discussed in order to meet the demands for soot emission, fuel economy, transient performance and output power at the same time. The power output from the diesel-LPG engine has not been reduced but slightly improved, though the volumetric efficiency is lower on the dual-fuel mode than on the diesel mode. It was found that there was hardly any effect of diesel-LPG fuel the power output of the engine when LPG content was as high as 40 percent approxi- mately. The experimental results of exhaust pollutants including NOx, CO and HC emissions are presented in the paper. In general, the NOx emission was slightly reduced when diesel-LPG fuel was used in comparison with net diesel fuel. Hydrocarbon emission, however, was quite high on the diesel-LPG mode, especially at partial loads with higher LPG content. The carbon monoxide (CO) emission was also increased at partial loads with higher LPG content, even though the CO emissions from diesel-LPG engine was not increased at full load. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3679.

Compared with the diesel baseline engine, it was found that there were a significant reduction in soot emission and an improvement of the fuel consumption with the diesel-LPG engine. Also the strat- egy on LPG content is discussed in order to meet the demands for soot emission, fuel economy, transient performance and output power at the same time. The power output from the diesel-LPG engine has not been reduced but slightly improved, though the volumetric efficiency is lower on the dual-ftiel mode than on the diesel mode. It was found that there was hardly any effect of diesel-LPG fuel on the power out- put of the engine when LPG content was as high as 40 percent approximately. The experimental results of exhaust pollutants including NOx, CO and HC emissions are presented in the paper. In general, the NOx emission was slightly reduced when diesel-LPG fuel was used in comparison with net diesel fuel. Hydrocarbon emission, however, was quite high on the diesel-LPG mode, especially at partial loads with higher LPG content. The carbon monoxide (CO) emission was also increased at partial loads with higher LPG content, even though the CO emissions from diesel-LPG engine was not increased at full load. 2001-01-3680. (SP- 1647) Performance and emissions of a DI diesel engine operated with LPG and ignition improving addi- tives. M. Alam and S. Goto, National Institute of Advanced Indus- trial Science and Technology; K. Sugiyama, M. Kajiwara, and M. Mori, Iwatani International Corp.; and M. Konno, M. Motohashi, and K. Oyama, Ibaraki Univ. This research investigated the performance and emissions of a direct injection (DI) diesel engine operated on 100% butane liquid petroleum gas (LPG). The LPG has a low cetane number, therefore di-tertiary-butyl peroxide (DTBP) and aliphatic hydrocarbon (AHC) were added to the LPG (100% butane) to enhance cetane number. With the cetane improver, stable diesel engine operation over a wide range of the engine loads was possible. By changing the concentra- tion of DTBP and AHC several different LPG blended fuels were obtained. In-cylinder visualization was also used in this research to check the combustion behavior. LPG and only AHC blended fuel showed NOx emission increased compared to Diesel fuel operation. Experimental result showed that the thermal efficiency of LPG pow- ered diesel engine was comparable to diesel fuel operation. Exhaust emissions measurements showed that NOx and smoke could be con- siderably reduced with the blend of LPG, DTBP and AHC. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 450</page><page sequence="450">2001-01-3675-2001-01-3685 2001-01-3681. (SP- 1647) Experiments with wood gas engines. Jesper Ahrenfelds Torben Kvist Jensen , Ulrik Henriksen, and Jesper Schramm , The Technical University of Denmark. The utilization of producer gas ? from thermal gasification of biomass - as a fuel for spark ignition gas engines is of vital impor- tance to the ongoing effort of making biomass gasification a com- mercially feasible technology. Tests have been carried out with a 1.1 -liter four-cylinder natural- aspirated SI engine in conjunction with a two-stage gasifier with a nominal thermal input of 100 kW. The fuel-gas is produced from wood chips in order to get a CO2 neutral fuel for combined heat and power production. The producer gas has a very low tar and particu- late content and high hydrogen content. As the gasifier was operated with varying fuel properties, engine tests were made with different fuel-gas compositions. The engine tests showed that producer gas has a power and efficiency advantage compared to natural gas when operating the engine at lean burn conditions. The engine was oper- ated at air/fuel ratios varying from stoichiometric to extremely lean burn (k&gt; 3). This was done while maintaining a good efficiency and power output. A gas-mixing apparatus was fabricated in order to make syn- thetic producer gas. With this apparatus, engine experiments were possible, without starting up the gasifier. Experiments have been conducted with a 0.48-liter one-cylinder high-compression ratio SI engine fueled by synthetic producer gas, natural gas and a mixture of both. The engine has a detachable piston crown. Different com- bustion chamber configurations, compression ratios and fuel-gas compositions have been tested. It has been shown that it is possible to operate the engine at a compression ratio of 16:1 without experiencing knocking. By using a fuel mixture of 50 v% producer gas and 50 v% natural gas the unburned hydrocarbon emissions from the engine were reduced by up to 70% compared to natural gas. 2001-01-3682. Effect of reduced boost air temperature on knock limited brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). Chad Sto- vell and James Chiù, Southwest Research Institute; and Ralph Hise and Paul Swenson, Advanced Technologies Management Inc. The effect of low temperature intake air on the knock limited brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) in a spark-ignited natural gas engine is described in this paper. This work was conducted to dem- onstrate the feasibility of using the vaporization of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to reduce the intake air temperature of engines operating on LNG fuel. The effect on steady-state emissions and transient response are also reported. Three different intake air temperatures were tested and evaluated as to their impact upon engine perfor- mance and gaseous emissions output. The results of these tests are as follows. The reduced intake air temperature allowed for a 30.7% (501 kPa) increase in the knock-limited BMEP (comparing the 10°C (50°F) intake air results with the 54.4°C (130°F) results). Exhaust emissions were recorded at constant BMEP for varying intake air temperatures. The raw BSNOx emissions were reduced by 0.6% (0.1 g/kW-hr, not a significant change) due to the chilled air, but the cor- rected BSNOx emissions were reduced by 17.8% (3.4 g/kW-hr). The BSHC emissions were reduced by 39.9% (0.5 g/kW-hr). The BSCO emissions, however, were increased by 7.5% (0.2 g/kW-hr). Tran- sient engine response revealed that the use of reduced temperature intake air provided a 15.3% (1.43 second) improvement in the time required to obtain an engine speed of 1600 rpm. Similarly, the chilled intake air reduced the time required to reach a set manifold air pressure of 212.4 kPa (30.8 psia) by 11.5% (1.21 seconds). 2001-01-3683. (SP- 1647) Preliminary investigation on the via- bility of 1,3-dioxolane as an alternative to MTBE in reformu- lated gasoline. Patrick J. Flynn, Mku Thaddeus Ityokumbul, and André L. Boehman, The Pennsylvania State Univ. An experimental investigation was conducted to determine the efficiency of 1,3-dioxolane as an alternative oxygenate to MTBE in Reformulated Gasoline. In the investigation, the effect of adding 1,3 dioxolane on octane rating was evaluated. The octane number of the fuels was determined using a Waukesha single-cylinder, 4-stroke cycle, 2-valve, CFR F-2U octane rating unit. Certified 87 octane gasoline was used as the base fuel which 1,3-dioxolane was added at specific volumetric proportions. Iso-octane (100 octane number) and N-heptane (0 octane number) are primary reference fuels that were blended at volumetric proportions to produce a reference base of known octane number. The reference base fuel of known octane number was used for comparison of knock tendency to the test fuels under the ASTM D 2699 (Research) and ASTM D 2700 (Motor) methods of testing. Cost analyses were conducted to determine and show the volume addition comparisons for MTBE, ethanol, and dioxolane to comply with current RFG regulations. Pricing of diox- olane was also evaluated to find out what the maximum production cost can be to still be competitive in the oxygenate market. A theo- retical price increase of the wholesale sales of gasoline due to dioxo- lane blending for RFG production was also included. The results obtained from the octane rating analysis show that as volume per- centage of dioxolane was added to the base fuel there was a steady increase in octane number. Furthermore, the theoretical, and experi- mental results clearly demonstrate that 1,3-dioxolane has the ability to be an effective oxygenate for RFG production. The cost analyses demonstrated that dioxolane will be able to decrease volume addi- tion by 1.05 and 1.5% respectively compared to ethanol to achieve compliance with the current 2% and 2.7% oxygen RFG standards. Furthermore, because of this volume decrease, dioxolane will be able to be sold wholesale up to $1.78/gallon to yield equivalent blending costs as ethanol to achieve the 2% oxygen RFG standard. The results, and cost analyses, were both discussed in detail to dem- onstrate why 1,3-dioxolane could be a viable alternative to MTBE and recommendations were given as to what should be accom- plished before dioxolane' s viability can be determined. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3684. (SP- 1648) Comparison and coupling of homo- geneous reactor and flamelet library soot modeling approaches for diesel combustion. S. Martinot, P. Beard, and J. Roesler, IFP ; and A. Garo, CORIA. Soot models applied to diesel combustion can be grouped into two classes, one based on the flamelet concept and the other based on the homogeneous reactor concept. The first assumes that the lam- inar diffusion flame structure of the reaction zone, in the mixture fraction space, is preserved while convected and strained by the tur- bulent flow. The second assumes that the properties of the reaction zone are locally homogeneous. Thus the aerodynamic and chemical reaction interactions are modeled with opposing assumptions: the first assumes fast chemistry, the second fast mixing. In this work, we first compare results obtained with a flamelet library approach to those with a homogeneous reactor approach. Recognizing that both types of models apply in different regions of diesel combustion, we then propose a new approach for soot model- ing in which they are coupled. The source terms for soot from each model are weighted and added with a criterion based on a compari- son between characteristic times for turbulence and fuel oxidation. In all calculations a new spray model based on an extended Lagran- gian-Eulerian approach and a new combustion model which allows a description of the fuel/oxidizer subgrid mixing are used. The results of the above three models are compared to experimental data in a high-pressure combustion cell. 2001-01-3685. (SP- 1648) Modifying an intake manifold to improve cylinder-to-cylinder EGR distribution in a DI diesel engine using combined CFD and engine experiments. Robert M. Siewert, Roger B. Krieger, Mark S. Huebler, Prafulla C. Baruah, and Bahram Khalighi, General Motors Corporation R&amp;D and Plan- ning; and Markus Wesslau, Opel Powertrain GmbH. Improved cylinder-to-cylinder distribution of EGR in a 2-L Direct-Injection (DI) diesel engine has been identified as one enabler to help reach more stringent emission standards. Through a combined effort of modeling, design, and experiment, two mani- 451</page><page sequence="451">2001-01-3685-2001-01-3693 folds were developed that improve EGR distribution over the origi- nal manifold while minimizing design changes to engine compo- nents or interfering with the many varied vehicle platform installa- tions. One of the modified manifolds, an elevated EGR entry (EEE) approach, provided a useful improvement over the originad design that meet Euro-II emission standards, and has been put into produc- tion as it enabled meeting the Euro III emissions requirements a year early. The second revision, the distributed EGR entry (DEE) design, showed potential for further improvement in EGR distribution. This design has two EGR outlets rather than the one used in the original and EEE manifolds, and was first identified by modeling to be a promising concept. Using rapid prototype parts with variable geom- etry, over 40 variations of the DEE concept were studied experimen- tally in an attempt to identify an improved configuration. Parallel CFD modeling studies of just a few configurations pointed to a much-improved design, while the experimental methods used to determine EGR distribution sometimes gave quite misleading results. CFD modeling further identified why the experimental results were sometimes conflicting. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3686. (SP- 1648) Statistical model and simulation of engine torque and speed correlation. Dinu Taraza , Wayne State Univ. Even under steady-state operating conditions, the pressure varia- tion in individual cylinders, and the corresponding gas-pressure torque are subjected to small random fluctuations from cycle to cycle. The gas-pressure torque of a cylinder may be expressed as a sum of harmonically variable components, each harmonic being affected by these fluctuations. A probabilistic model of the vector interpreting such a harmonic component is developed and used to determine the statistical parameters of the resultant random vector representing the corresponding harmonic order of the engine torque. At the low frequencies of the lowest harmonic orders of the engine torque the crankshaft behaves like a rigid body. This behavior per- mits to correlate the statistical parameters of the same harmonic components of the resultant torque and of the measured engine speed. This correlation is proved by experiments and used to iden- tify faulty cylinders. 2001-01-3687. (SP- 1648) Effect of injection parameters on auto-ignition and soot formation in diesel sprays. T. Rente , V. I. Golovitchev, and I. Denbratt, Chalmers University of Technology. A validation study of the numerical model of n-heptane spray combustion based on experimental constant-volume data was done, by comparing auto-ignition delays for different pre-turbulence levels and initial temperatures, flame contours, and soot distribu- tions under Diesel-like conditions. The basic novelty of the methodology developed is the imple- mentation of the partially stirred reactor (PaSR) model accounting for detailed chemistry/turbulence interactions. It is based on the assumption that the chemical processes proceed in two successive steps: micro mixing, simulated on a sub-grid scale, is followed by the reaction act. When the all Re number RNG k-e or LES models are employed, the micro mixing time can be consistently defined giving the combustion model a 'well-closed' form incorporated into the KIVA-3V code. The reduced but still detailed mechanism inte- grating the n-heptane oxidation chemistry with the kinetics of aro- matics formation (61 species, including soot forming agents up to the third aromatic ring, A2R5, and NOx species, 252 reactions) was used in the simulations. The effect on injection parameter variations (injection duration, schedule, including split injection, etc.) was given special attention. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3691. Deterioration of automotive catalytic convert- ers: Physical catalyst characterization. Marcel V. van der Schoot, Suresh K. Bhargava , and Deepak B. Akolekar , RM IT University ; Karl Föger, Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd.; and Harry C. Watson , Univer- sity of Melbourne. The degree of physical deterioration of catalytic converters removed from two groups of motor vehicles with low and high odometer readings have been studied. The changes in the physical and chemical properties between the two catalyst groups were inves- tigated using the XRD, BET and PIXE/PIGE techniques. Thermal damage was the main catalyst deterioration mechanism in both odometer groups. The low odometer group showed near-uniformity in both surface area loss (average 45 %) and degree of CeCh sinter- ing representing the baseline thermal deterioration from normal vehicle operation. High odometer catalysts displayed more complex deactivation mechanisms involving both chemical contamination and thermal deactivation such as support phase transformation, internal 'hot zone' and contaminant-support interactions. The linear relationship between the contamination (increased) and kilometers traveled in the low odometer group (extrapolated to the kilometers traveled in the high odometer group) showed less contamination than predicted. There was no evidence of crystalline contaminant compounds in the low odometer catalysts and contami- nation concentrations greater than 10.5 wt. % resulted in pore mouth blocking. High odometer catalysts showed considerable chemical contamination, in both crystalline and amorphous forms, and increased Pb concentrations. An induced thermal deactivation treatment was conducted on a contaminated catalyst, showing a major surface area loss, contami- nant vaporization and formation of CePC&gt;4 and CeAlCb. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3692. Fuel consumption of a mid class vehicle with infinitely variable transmission. G. Carbone and L. Mangialardi , Politecnico di Bari ; and G. Mantriota , Università della Basilicata. The continuously variable transmission with infinite ratio range could be utilized in automotive industries for automatic change gear without the need of the friction clutch. In this work we study the performance of a mid passenger car provided with Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT). By means of a simulation model we evaluate the vehicle's fuel consumption with the hypothesis to consider the value of IVT' s ratio speed that mini- mizes the specific fuel consumption. Furthermore the IVT' s perfor- mance is compared with that of more traditional configurations. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Engines 2001-01-3693. (SP- 1645) The influence of fuel components on PM and PAH exhaust emissions from a DI diesel engine - Effects of pyrene and sulfur contents. Shigeo Hori and Kazuyuki Narusawa, National Traffic Safety and Environment Laboratory. Particulate matter (PM) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured under steady-state engine operating condi- tions in the exhaust of a DI diesel engine that meets the Japanese 1994 heavy-duty vehicle standards. In this study, to examine and discuss the effects of pyrene and sulfur contents in fuels on PM and PAH emissions, experiments were performed using both ordinary diesel fuel and a specified fuel having simple hydrocarbon compo- nents and very few aromatics. In the experiments, pyrene and sulfur contents in the fuels were changed by the addition of reagents to the fuel. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) From the experi- ments using ordinary JIS No. 2 diesel fuel with a pyrene reagent added to yield 400ppm pyrene, it was found that pyrene addition brings about an increase in soluble organic fraction (SOF) under low load engine operating conditions. On the other hand, soot remark- ably increased under high load conditions. (2) Pyrene addition into the fuel increases pyrene emission. Pyrene emission is mostly brought about by combustion in the cylinder and the formation of pyrene is accelerated by the increase of pyrene content in the fuel. (3) The emissions of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and benzo(ghi)perylene (BghiP), which have relatively high reactivity, decrease with the addition of sulfur to the fuel. This suggests that these PAHs are 452</page><page sequence="452">2001-01-3693-2001-01-3725 chemically active and are consumed by chemical reactions on the filter where some fine droplets of sulfuric acid exist. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2001-01-3694. Effects of fuel properties on SIDI fuel injector deposit. Tsuyoshi Ashida, Yasunori Takei, and Hirohoko Hosi, Toyota Motor Co. The tendency of spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) engines to form injector deposits was investigated using engine dynamometer tests on a SIDI engine equipped with fan spray type injectors. Fif- teen test fuels with varying 90% distillation temperature (T90), aro- matics, olefins, oxygenates and sulfur levels were prepared to iden- tify the effects of fuel properties on injector deposits. The results suggested that not only the T90 but also the number of alkyl substit- uent of aromatics had effects on injector deposit formation. Effects of detergents on the injector deposit cleanliness were also evaluated in this study. 2001-01-3695. Deterioration of automotive catalytic convert- ers (part 2): catalytic performance characterisation. Marcel V. van der Schoot, Suresh K. Bhargava, and Deepak B. Akolekar , RM IT Univ.; Karl Föger , Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd ; and Harry C. Watson , University of Melbourne. This is the second part of a two-part study that compared the degree of deterioration of catalytic converters taken from vehicles with low and high odometer readings. Part two details the catalytic performance characteristics of the catalysts that were physically characterised, according to chemical contamination and thermal degradation, previously in part one. The catalytic activity was deter- mined using engine dynamometer and laboratory tests. The low odometer catalysts showed largely uniform light-off temperatures for CO, HC and NO that were increased in the order of 20 % relative to a new catalyst. The steady state activity was largely unaffected. The dominant deactivation mechanism of these catalysts was found to be the baseline thermal deterioration of the alumina washcoat under normal vehicle operating conditions. The deactivation shown in the high odometer catalysts was highly varied with the greatest loss of activity resulting from exposure to severe thermal conditions. The best performing catalyst in the group showed similar activity to the low odometer group whilst the worst catalyst was totally inef- fective due to extreme thermal exposure. An induced thermal deactivation of a catalyst in the low odome- ter group was conducted to simulate a prolonged high temperature excursion possible in a vehicle. The result was a large loss of HC conversion activity and a narrowing of the lambda window. 2001 SAE Transactions Journal of Passenger Cars - Mechanical Systems 2001-01-3711.

Hans Schnitzer, Joanneum Research. This paper deals with the development of environmental protec- tion in enterprises from End-of-Pipe - Technologies through Cleaner Production and Eco-Efficiency to Sustainability. The developments required relate to the resources, the technologies, the products and services, the transport as well as the integration of the commercial activity into the natural and socio-economic environments. The 'Sustainable Enterprise' does not have a specific appearance or a defined 'state, 'but it follows some clearly defined rules. There are six dimensions where activities can be allocated. Sustainable Development is an opportunity for companies who decide to be among the first. This is true within any sector of indus- try or service, being of more importance for those who depend on large amounts of material and energy resources or that who give great impact to the natural or social environment. 2001-01-3721. (P-365) Automated rapid transit - What size vehicle is environmentally sustainable? Arthur E. Bishop and John Mole, Bishop Austrans Limited. Sustainability in transport, defined as provision of better trans- port service at lower cost and with less environmental stress versus existing transport modes, is essential for the success of a new trans- port system. Whilst enormous amounts of capital have been spent on the transportation systems of today towards decreasing energy usage, pollution, and congestion, we have yet to implement urban transportation that can accommodate demands of modern societies and be sustainable. As rail transport moves towards driverless control, the question arises as to whether traditional large capacity vehicles remain the best application for the new automation technologies that have been developed. In view of the established dominance of the motor vehi- cle, the relative decline in train use (primarily brought about by the superior service offered by the car) and the lack of a viable alterna- tive to the car, the authors have examined a range of automated tran- sit vehicles and conclude that a system utilizing vehicles of about nine passengers is advantageous in terms of sustainability, com- pared with traditional modes of rail travel or with Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). 2001-01-3722. (P-365) Reduction of life cycle CO2 emissions - The example of Honda Insight. Tadayoshi Hayashi, Masataka Kumata, and Kaoru Aoki, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. In order to reduce CO2 emissions from automobiles, a highly fuel-efficient hybrid vehicle, the 'Insight, 'has been developed at Honda. Life cycle CO2 emissions are compared for the aluminum- bodied Insight, a simulated steel-bodied Insight, and a conventional gasoline vehicle. Life cycle CO2 emissions is still dominated by the in-use fuel consumption. However, the contribution of CO2 emis- sion from material use and processing could increase when the vehi- cle fuel consumption is greatly reduced. The use of recycled alumi- num reduces CO2 emission from the aluminum-bodied Insight. 2001-01-3724.

In order to review improvement of the recycling rate for an end- of-life vehicle, we implemented a life cycle assessment on the three treatment scenarios for automobile shredder residue (ASR): (A) Direct landfill of whole ASR, (B) Landfill after volume reduction and solidification, (C) Landfill of dry-distillation residue after energy recovery. As a result, we confirmed that case C was effective in achieving the numerical targets of the JAMA voluntary action plan for 2002. 2001-01-3725. (P-365) Full vehicle LCAs: A review. John L. Sullivan, Ford Motor Corporation; and Elisa Cobas-Flores, Insti- tuto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de. A review has been conducted on nine published full- vehicle life cycle inventory studies. Our analysis shows that all studies conclude that the vehicle operational stage is dominant regarding energy and associated emissions. For energy this ranges between 60-80% of the total burden, the magnitude of which is dependent on the efficiency of the powertrain. On the other hand, for burdens like solid waste, the material production stage of the life cycle is dominant. When life cycle burden results are decomposed into fixed and variable compo- 453</page><page sequence="453">2001-01-3725-2001-01-3732 nents per mile driven, it is found the variable energy and associated stoichiometric emission (CO2) results demonstrate the underlying physics of vehicle propulsion, i.e., they are dependent on vehicle weight and powertrain efficiency. On the other hand, the fixed com- ponent of energy and CO2 shows more apparent scatter, which can, nevertheless, be reconciled on the basis of vehicle material composi- tion and vehicle lifetime drive distance. For SOx, hydrocarbons and solid waste, fixed and variable life cycle burden components gener- ally showed increasing trends with vehicle mass. Unfortunately, not enough data of sufficient quality is available to determine reliable values for these trends. Hence, average values for them are reported. Finally, it apparently takes more energy to fabricate a vehicle in North America than in Europe or Japan. 2001-01-3726. (P-365) Life cycle assessment of aluminum casting processes. Robert D. Stephens and Candace S. Wheeler , General Motors Corporation Research &amp; Development and; and Maria Pryor, Worldwide Facilities Group. In recent years, the environmental impact of automotive products and processes has become an issue of increasing competitive impor- tance. Life cycle analysis (LCA) provides a tool that allows compa- nies to assess and compare the environmental impact of a variety of material and process choices. This enables companies to manu- facture environmentally sound products of exceptional value by environmentally conscious processes. In this study, we used LCA to compare the environmental burdens associated with three alumi- num casting processes: lost foam, semi-permanent mold, and preci- sion sand. We obtained data from one primary and one secondary facility for each of the three processes studied. These data included all of the environmental burdens associated with raw material and energy consumption, gaseous emissions, and waste generation. In addition, we modeled the environmental burdens associated with the production and transport of the materials used during the manufac- turing processes. Both capital and operating environmental costs were also considered. In general, the environmental burdens associ- ated with the lost foam and semi-permanent mold processes were very similar while the burdens associated with the precision sand process were higher for each of the parameters studied. Overall, lost foam was determined to be the most environmentally friendly way to cast aluminum heads and blocks. 2001-01-3727. (P-365) Life cycle assessment of electric bike application in Shanghai. Cheng Zhang and Chengtao Wang , Shanghai Jiao Tong University ; and John Sullivan , Weijan Han , and Dennis Schuetzle, Ford Motor Co. Shanghai had about a half million gasoline-powered motorbikes in 2000. The motorbikes have become a significant contributor to ambient air pollution in Shanghai. This study selected an electric bike (e-bike) as a potential replacement for gasoline-powered motorbikes. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out for the two systems in terms of energy utilization and environment implica- tions. LCA results indicated that e-bike is not better than the motor- bike in all environment categories. The e-bike consumes less energy than the motorbike during its life cycle, and emits less GWP into air, and less BOD, COD, DS and HC into water. On the other hand, it generates more solid wastes, acidification potential, and HM than the motorbike, due to electric power production. Therefore, the Shanghai government should advocate advanced batteries and clean coal-fired power plant technologies while implementing an electri- cal vehicle plan. 2001-01-3728. (P-365) Adaptation of the passenger car to the road conditions of third world countries. Nikolai V. Lyachenkov and Michael P. Ramasanov, AUTOVAZ Inc. Most of new cars are designed for excellent road conditions. Their production costs and as result their impact on the environment increase continuously. Nevertheless, the roads of the third world countries and some territories of the former USSR are far from per- fect. Adaptation of some new technical solutions to the regional road conditions have been conducted in the Development Depart- ment of AUTOVAZ on the basis of road tests and wind tunnel mea- surements. The data obtained do not demonstrate an importance of low aerodynamic drag for environmental sustainability. 2001-01-3729. (P-365) Environmental impact of a clean urban bus fleet in the city Of Zaragoza. E. Larrodé, J. De- Velasco, L. Castejón, S. Arenzana, and L. M. Lanzan, University of Zaragoza. The aim of this paper is the study of the environmental impact of prototypes of electric buses in the urban transportation. The source of the power is given by a fuel cell, which produces electric- ity by using hydrogen as primary fuel, and implies the introduction of the most advanced clean technologies different to the traditional diesel motorizations. Clean technologies are defined as those that from production to the end of its usable life, passing by its use phase period and therefore including the recycling of parts and recovering of residues do not affect the environment. 2001-01-3730. (P-365) Life cycle engineering and design for environment of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Matthias Fink- beiner, Klaus Ruhland, Halil Cetiner, and Bruno Stark, Daimler- Chrysler AG. Mercedes-Benz at DaimlerChrysler has been developing and applying Life-Cycle-Engineering (LCE) and Life-Cycle- Assessment (LCA) for almost 10 years. Extensive experience and know-how has been gained by several complete car LCAs and more than 100 LCAs for parts. According to our experience LCA/LCE is most effectively and efficiently used to support the development of new products, i.e., as a tool for Design for the Environment. The concept and implementation of Design for Environment (DfE) at Mercedes-Benz will be introduced. Both, concept and implementation are the result of several years of development. Now- adays, DfE is established as common practice and fully integrated in the Mercedes-Benz Development Process. This approach is illustrated by the exemplary case study of the recent C-Class model. The parameters assessed during the develop- ment process include hazardous materials, use of recycled materials, use of renewable materials and others. One main aspect of the DfE process was a LCA study on the complete vehicle level and several LCAs for parts. 2001-01-3731. (P-365) LCA working procedures when devel- oping environmental product declarations for cars from Volvo. Elisabeth Dahlqvist and Agneta Wendel, Volvo Car Corporation. Volvo Car Corporation has, since 1998, published an environ- mental product declaration (EPD) for each new car model. The aim of the declaration is to present environmental information for the whole life cycle of the car to consumers. The information is based on life cycle assessment (LCA), but is also complemented with information on environmental management systems and recycling. The declarations are verified by a third party and comply with the ISO 14040, ISO 14031, ISO 14021 and ISO 14001 standards. This paper will focus on the link between the life cycle assessment studies and the environmental product declaration. 2001-01-3732.

Five leading software tools, Boustead 4.2, GaBi 3.2, Sima- Pro 4.0, TEAM 3.0, and Toolkit, currently in use or under consider- ation by life cycle practitioners, were selected for testing, and a detailed evaluation scheme was used to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools for practical application in automotive life cycle studies. 454</page><page sequence="454">2001-01-3732-2001-01-3739 A consensus numerical score for each of 20 separate test criteria was assigned to each of the software packages under evaluation, and the total scores compared. On the basis of these scores, the authors chose GaBi version 3.2 as the LCA software package currently best suited for use by experienced life cycle practitioners in conducting environmental life cycle assessments in the automotive industry. This choice is based on the professional experience and judgment of the authors and should not be construed as a blanket product endorsement or criticism of other commercial products, all of which possess useful features and may be further improved and upgraded at any time. GaBi was judged to be the best software tool, with TEAM a close second. This was due in part to the quality and suitability of their databases, frequency of updates, clarity and logic of LCA opera- tions, and acceptance among the user community. The impact evalu- ation methods used in GaBi and TEAM were also sufficiently advanced and flexible for full life cycle assessment in automotive contexts. A limiting feature of all the software tools was the absence of features specifically pertaining to design for the environment (DfE) studies. 2001-01-3733. (P-365) Computer-assisted product structure analysis for the automotive industry regarding optimal end-of- life strategies. Robert Arenz, Horst Krasowski , and Winfried Wahl , T Systems.

(P-365) Substances of concern: A collaborative database. Marc Magaud, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Lyons ; and François Jallon, French Plastics Converters Federa- tion. As the automotive industry faces increasing pressure regarding substances and end-of-life issues, a group of OEMs, chemical sup- pliers and two professional organizations have joined their efforts to generate a common database. This instrument, which contains regulatory requirements and automakers' standards will serve as a common reference for the entire automotive supply chain. 2001-01-3735. (P-365) Sustainability and management of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) within the European Union's direc- tive on ELVs. M. R. Johnson and M. H. Wang, University of Wind- sor. The future sustainability of the automobile must include an approach to handle End-of-life Vehicles (ELVs) economically and within the new requirements imposed by the new European Direc- tive. The European Directive on ELVs will change the management of ELVs in Europe by forcing auto manufacturers worldwide to take a greater financial responsibility for the proper environmental han- dling of their vehicles at the product's end-of-life (EOL). Essen- tially, the new policy encompasses Extended Producer Responsibil- ity (EPR) by requiring hazardous materials to be removed from the vehicle and specific recovery targets (focusing on reuse and recy- cling) to be met. This paper discusses the findings of a study that applied a demanufacturing optimization model on a dismantled vehicle to evaluate the economics and material destinations within the imposed requirements of the new legislation. The results of the current study provide insight into the future problems and opportu- nities that will be brought forth by the new Directive. 2001-01-3737. (P-365) 60 g/km CO2 without performance loss. Yves Toussaint and Nicolas Naniot, University of Liège. The University of Liege and Breuer Technical Development, Belgium, have designed a parallel hybrid drive train, now imple- mented in a VW Lupo. The original objectives of the concept were the reduction of total CO2 emissions without performance loss and an acceptable zero- emission range for inner cities. This paper presents: Metropol, a homemade hybrid simulation software, including engine cold start and dynamic battery models, hybrid management strategy for the lowest CO2 emissions, final per- formance, consumption and emissions of the vehicle. 2001-01-3738. (P-365) An environmental-economic evalua- tion of hybrid electric and other advanced vehicles. Lester B. Lave, Carnegie Mellon University; and Heather L. MacLean, Uni- versity of Toronto. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and other advanced propulsion technologies offer greater fuel economy and lower pollutant and tailpipe emissions. Some experts regard the HEV technology as a practical, attractive solution to social concerns about fuel economy (and related fossil fuel conservation) and vehicle emissions. The technology is practical; however, an HEV is more expensive to pro- duce than a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE). In a world of limited resources and many petroleum users and emissions sources, the policy question is whether the best use of resources is to build HEV, to improve the fuel economy and lower emissions from other sources, or to devote the resources to other environmen- tal projects. We compare the second-generation (designed for the United States) Toyota Prius, to the conventional internal combustion engine Toyota Corolla. We examine both private (vehicle purchase price, maintenance, and fuel) and social (the pollutant [non-methane organic gases, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides] and carbon diox- ide emissions) costs. For each of the vehicles, we evaluate lifetime vehicle exhaust emissions as well as upstream emissions from pro- ducing the fuel. We find that the second-generation Prius is still not cost effective in improving fuel-economy and lowering emissions. For the Prius to be attractive to U.S. consumers, the price of gasoline would have to be more than three times greater than the present level. To be attractive to regulators, the social value of abating tailpipe emissions would have to be 14 times greater than conventional values. Alterna- tively, the value of abating greenhouse gas emissions would have to be at least $220 per ton. We judge that any HEV would have a difficult time competing with the Corolla because of the Corolla's already high fuel economy and low pollutant emissions. We also examine the costs and benefits of making a General Motors Corporation Silverado pickup truck into a gasoline hybrid. Like the analysis of the Prius, we again find that the price of gaso- line or social value of abating carbon dioxide would have to be higher than the base case values in order to payback the cost of con- verting the vehicle to an HEV. Finally, we find that at current gaso- line prices and carbon dioxide valuation, a conventional vehicle would need to have a fuel economy of 13 mpg or less in order for a $4,000 cost of converting it to an HEV to get 30% better fuel econ- omy would pay off. We conclude that HEV will not have significant sales unless fuel prices rise several-fold or unless regulators man- date them. 2001-01-3739. (P-365) Evaluation of lignocellulosic ethanol to fuel the USA-Canadian light-duty transportation fleet. Heather L. MacLean, University of Toronto; Lester B. Lave and Michael Griffin, Carnegie Mellon University ; and Satish Joshi, Michigan State University. The most attractive non-fossil fuel for the USA-Canadian light- duty transportation fleet is ethanol produced domestically from lig- nocellulosic agricultural feedstocks and residues. Ideally, this fuel can be produced sustainably without using any fossil fuels and with- out any net carbon dioxide emissions. Growing switchgrass or hybrid trees and using agricultural wastes, such as rice straw, bagasse, and corn stover, holds the potential for transforming the economies of the countries. Well-crafted programs could increase farm income, generate foreign exchange/export earnings, and result in a host of sociologie benefits, while improving environmental quality and sustainability. Five primary drivers would make a bio- mass ethanol industry attractive: a high petroleum price, energy security concerns, stringent greenhouse gas emissions limitations, 455</page><page sequence="455">2001-01-3739-2001-01-3746 an increase in CAFE applying to petroleum products, and a large demand for oxygenated fuels together with banning MTBE. 2001-01-3740. (P-365) Sustainability assessment using dynamic systems modelling. Albert W. Chan and David E. Minns , National Research Council of Canada; and Bert Mclnnis and Rob- ert Hoffman , Robbert Associates. A dynamic systems modelling approach is examined for its suit- ability for assessing sustainable performance in technological inno- vation. A computer model of the energy needs in the Canadian road transportation sector was developed to study the sustainable perfor- mance of bio-ethanol. It considers the potential increase in the con- sumption of energy as the economy expands in the next 25 years, taking into account demographic trends, consumer choices, and technological advances. While the primary environmental measure tracked is focused on greenhouse gas emissions with respect to the Kyoto target, it also includes considerations for land use and farm- ing practices, and distinguishes between fossil and bio-carbon emis- sions. As well, it allows for different sources of biomass, including crop byproducts and dedicated crops. Various scenarios for bio- ethanol to penetrate the consumer market were set up to investigate a range of future evolution paths. 2001-01-3741. (P-365) Optimization of instrument panels to assist recycling quota dismantling/mechanical recycling versus ASR treatment/chemical recycling. Frank E. Mark , DOW Europe ; and Christian Niewerth and Gerhard Slik, DOW Automotive. The European ELV directive will demand from the automotive industry a 85% reuse and recycling quota to meet by 2015. New vehicle registration requirements will force the industry to show already beginning 2005 for new vehicles how this can be done in principle. Methods how to calculate the overall vehicle reuse and recycling quota are defined and agreed within the automotive indus- try today. This very high reuse and recycling quota of 85% for the complete vehicle forces the OEM and the supply industry to reach a target level for recycling of plastics, which is higher than legislation has set targets in other market sectors. All large plastic parts are assessed how and to what extent they can contribute to the target. The IP as manufactured today is probably the most challenging part in an ELV to recycle. But new design solutions, material con- cepts and recycling strategies are working towards this 85% target. Design of a future IP takes into account all essential criteria in the manufacturing like parts consolidation, etc., and the 'demanufactur- ing 'proces s (dismantling, logistics, recycling,...). The all PP IP design concept has been deliberately chosen due to the large cost reduction potential in the manufacturing step. The requirement to meet the 85% reuse and recycling target should be met at the lowest compliance cost, which does include the demanu- facturing cost. In this paper the 'demanufacturing' chain will be presented under different scenarios like integrated with other materials or not inte- grated plastic dismantling concepts. The economic analysis was car- ried out for a combined recycling and recovery IP approach using today's facilities of different industries like ELV dismantling, poly- mer recycling to optimize overall ELV directive compliance cost through the use of existing infra structure. Product applications for the recycled materials are also addressed. 2001-01-3742. (P-365) Integrating LCA and DfE in the design of electrical and electronic products for the automotive sector. Juan Carlos Alonso , Jordi Bigorra, and Jordi Giró, Lear Automo- tive EEDS Spain S.L. The objective of this paper is to present how the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) and DfE (Design for Environment) methodologies are being used in the design process of electrical &amp; electronic products at Lear Automotive EEDS (LEED). In this paper are presented the major roadblocks found during the implementation of these methodologies and the solutions given by the European Technological Center (ETC) in order to solve them (e.g., development of a specific DfE checklist). Also there are presented the results obtained in the application of these methodologies to a real electronic device. The target prod- uct is a prototype of an Advanced Smart Junction Box (ASJB), placed in the engine compartment, which manages power and signal distribution for different car functions and loads. The new design and the improvements achieved show that the use of LCA and DfE in the design step is a powerful tool to reduce the life cycle environmental impact of the products that Lear provide to its customers. 2001-01-3744. (P-365) How prepared are U.S. dismantlers to meet the EU Directive for ELV recycling? Richard T. Paul, Con- sultant. This paper will present the results of evaluating the ability of U.S Automotive Recycling Centers (ARCs) to meet requirements equiv- alent to the recently legislated European Union (EU) Directive on automotive recycling. Data and other available information regard- ing these requirements are used for an analysis of the status among dismantlers in the U.S. to meet requirements equivalent to the EU Directive and to estimate the performance of the U.S. recycling infrastructure. Criteria used to categorize the performance of U.S. ARC's include -Number of dismantlers, - Facility size, - Facility locations, - Ability to meet certification requirements, - Environmental com- pliance, -Techniques and methods in use, - Equipment in use, - Dis- posal practices, and - Market Factors This analysis provides insight on current levels of performance at ARC's, vehicle recyclability, component reuse, material recy- cling, vehicle pretreatment and handling of hazardous materials. 2001-01-3745. (P-365) Treatment center of end-of-life vehi- cles. Vicente Diaz and M. Guadalupe Fernandez, Carlos III Univer- sity. Problems generated by waste coming from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs), the increase of the total number of cars and indiscriminate abandonment of vehicles has given rise to publishing of European Union Directive 2000/5 3/EC on ELV, in which measures intended for prevention and recovery of waste coming from ELVs are estab- lished. A methodology relating to depollution and disassembly of ELVs is presented in this article, aspects that shall allow to describing the main guidelines that define the future authorized centers for process- ing of ELV. The processes for depollution, disassembly, re-use, recycling and recovery for elements and components have been ana- lyzed so that experience has been attained both for present treatment of ELVs according to the European Directive and what refers to the future recycling capacity of car vehicles coming into service at the present time. 2001-01-3746. (P-365) VAI car wreck recycling - Master plan. Müller Heinz, Ramaseder Norbert, and Müller Johannes, VOEST ALPINE Industrieanlagenbau GmbH &amp; Co. (VAI). The currently practiced recycling of car wrecks with shredders and by dumping the shredder waste is becoming more and more problematic due to the critical situation regarding dumping yards and the strongly increasing dumping costs. This paper describes a closed line for the complete recycling of every car type without deposition of material. Both ecological and economical aspects are considered. The special disassembly of old cars, additionally to met- allurgical recycling, is an effective way for utilization. To imple- ment this idea, future developments must be taken into account. VAI is in a position to present a complete recycling concept that ensures a considerable reduction of wastes and emissions by utilizing the organic plastics as melting and heating energy, as well as for steam generation and the binding of inorganic components in the slag. This 456</page><page sequence="456">2001-01-3746-2001-01-3752 plan also considers future developments in the automobile industry through input material recycling.

(P-365) Analysis and assessment of automo- biles with regard to the requirements of design for recycling. Joachim Boes, Martin Sander , and Wolfram Seibert , FORGIS GmbH. As the practical example it is shown how and with which meth- ods and tools the research group Forgis treats the subject 'Design for Recycling 'by order of the automobile and suppliers' industry. An analysis of the actual state takes place by vehicle dismantling (serial of prototypes). As a result from these data, a software-based model of the vehicle is generated, which provides a part-orientated description of the vehicle concerning the criteria of design for recy- cling. This description implies dismantling reports for the complete vehicle and its modules and a positive/negative list for its compo- nents. By means of this evaluation, the problems emerging in the design phase are pointed out, concerning the implementation of legal and design-for-recycling requirements into the design of vehicle and components. By means of practical training, there is a sensitization of product responsibilities for optimization potentials. By these measures and by specially developed software applica- tions, existing product-information can be checked already in the early design phase concerning the criteria of design for recycling. Thereby possible modifications can be realized already before the serial production starts. 2001-01-3748. (P-365) Results obtained by methanol-fuelling diesel engine. Marcel Ginu Popa , Niculae Negurescu , Constantin Pana , and Alexandru Racovitza, POLITEHNICA Universit. The control of diesel engine exhaust emissions (NOx and smoke) can be achieved using methanol as a single fuel or together with classic diesel fuel. The low value of methanol Cetane Number (CN 5) makes autoignition difficult. This paper presents the experimental results obtained by providing two different methods of diesel fuel and methanol engine supplying. The first method consists in the methanol admission through a carburetor combined with the classic diesel fuel injection (diesel-carburetor D-C), and the second one refers to the separate fuels injection (double injection DMI). The experimental research related to the first fuelling method was car- ried out on two types of DI engines: the D 1 15 (multi-sprays) type and the D 2156 MTN 8 type (injected on the wall). The main goal is to analyze the exhaust emissions when the engine operates follow- ing the D-C method using the maximum possible methanol percent- age substituting diesel fuel. Considering these, the power obtained for certain operating regimes is higher than that obtained for classic diesel engine D. From the exhaust emissions measurements resulted that the NOx levels can be significantly reduced for all the engine loads. Regarding the smoke, reduced levels were achieved only at high engine loads (&gt;50%) although it is known that these smoke reduced levels are provided at low engine loads for D. The smoke level could mark a limitation for the methanol used quantity inside the engine's cylinder. In order to increase even more the substitute methanol percent- age, analysis were made on D 2156 MTN 8 engine type applying the second described fuelling method DMI. A model was issued for simulating the processes that develop inside the engine's cylinder, presenting the heat release characteristics typical for the methanol combustion. 2001-01-3749. (P-365) A study on spray and combustion behavior in heavy-duty diesel engine equipped with EGR. Doo Sung Baik , Young Chool Han , and Sang Ki Oh, Kookmin University. EGR, usually, is known as a technique that dramatically reduces NOx emission from diesel engine. Application of this technique, however, is difficult because it is likely to cause the deterioration in fuel consumption and the increase in PM emission. For the heavy- duty diesel engines, especially, trade-off between the PM and NOx formation becomes more severe, as well as may raise the problem in lubricant and durability. Numerous researches, therefore, have been conducted to opti- mize EGR rate which minimizes emission level of NOx without increasing in PM and reduction of engine power. In this paper, as the research for the 11,000 cc turbocharged diesel engine equipped with an EGR valve, one predicted the combustion and reduction characteristics of NO, 02, and CO2. Also, One tried to make a selec- tion of optimized EGR rates based on these results. The emission levels of CO2 were substantially increased according to the increase in EGR rate. The reduction rate of NO increased at the higher load, rather than lower load. 2001-01-3750. (P-365) Zero emission vehicles and sustainable mobility - ZeTek power's alkaline fuel cells. Eddy De Geeter, . Alkaline fuel cells are efficient performers with an excellent ped- igree of high reliability and good life. While the AFC 's used in space applications are complex and costly, the terrestrial ZeTek Power versions, operating as hybrid systems with a buffer battery or as a stationary power source, are not. In practice, the alkaline cell is very well developed, simple to operate, has a built in cooling sys- tem, offers excellent reliability and is inexpensive to manufacture in small quantities. This paper will also look at the overall efficiency of the alkaline fuel cell. The performance of the basic system during its lifetime and the electrochemical improvements that have already been achieved by the adoption of modern catalysts will be highlighted. The paper will demonstrate the immediate potential of the system to satisfy the technical and economic requirements for an on-board traction bat- tery charger in vehicles operating within a limited geographical area, and in electric boats. Current demonstrations will be discussed in these markets - vehicle, marine - with examples of how each application has its own design requirements. The ZASI program (ZeTek Power Approved System Integra- tors), an opportunity to get on board with the zero-emission, fuel- cell technology - die power source to drive the future, will be explained. 2001-01-3751. (P-365) Comparison of CO2 emission levels for internal combustion engine and fuel cell automotive propulsion systems. R. Ellinger, K. Meitz, and P. Pr enninger, AVL List GmbH; and S. Salchenegger, and W. Brandstätter, CDL-ACT Mining Uni- versity Leoben. The well-to-wheel CO2 emissions and energy use of internal combustion engines (diesel and gasoline) are compared to fuel cell automotive propulsion systems. The fuel cell technologies investi- gated are polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), alkaline fuel cell (AFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The fuels are assumed to be produced from either crude oil or natural gas. The comparison is based on driving cycle simulations of a mid-class passenger car with an inertia test weight of 1350 kg. The study shows that the opti- mized diesel drive train (downsized mated to an integrated starter generator) achieves the best overall energy efficiency. The lowest CO2 emissions are produced by compressed natural gas (CNG) vehi- cles. Fuel cell propulsion systems achieve similar or even better CO2 emission values under hot-start conditions but suffer from high energy input required during warm-up. 2001-01-3752.

Computer-aided technology of gathering, analysis and process- ing of tribological information is presented. It is based on Internet opportunities for exchange of information, Database and Knowl- edge processing technologies for keeping and using of the informa- tion. Proposed approach allows to solve unformalized problems of material choice for friction units by methods of Artificial Intelli- gence. Algorithms and software for tribodesigning were developed. It could be used either as a separate design tool or as a part of some existing CAD/CAE system.

(P-365) Environmental knowledge manage- ment in the product development process. A. Meyer, F. Schmolke, J. Gediga, and H. Florin, PE Product Engineering GmbH. The basis for an environmental benign design of the production is the knowledge of the environmental impacts of processes. By set- ting up an Environmental Knowledge Management System (EKMS) the perception can be organized. The application of the EKMS is divided into two steps: 1. Documentation of the actual state with the focus on data collection and modelling of technical systems (pro- duction of products). 2. Derive from prognostic statements by means of evaluated data and the identification of potentials for optimiza- tions. The implementation and updating lays the foundations for the environmental optimization of the planning, development and pro- duction. The target is to ensure the availability of environmental information in the entire product developing process. The decision maker can identify optimization potentials with the help of this sys- tem already in an early stage of the product development process. Therefore measures can be arranged for the sustainable production which also causes cost savings. 2001-01-3755. (P-365) Comparative analysis of dismantla- bility for LADA cars. Roman L. Petrov, Michael V. Vasilyev, Oxana N. Kabanova, and Victor A. Kirillov, AVTOVAZ Inc. Since the end of the 20th century it has apparently been shown that global expansion and human activity has threatened the ecologi- cal safety margin of our planet. The aftermath of ecological disasters incurred by human beings and their products could be irreversible. It became clear that the internal-combustion engine and automotive manufacture as a whole influenced not only local environments, but also created global effects with significant consequences. Dismantling, recycling and utilization of cars are components of the car total life cycle (TLC) and exert great influence on total eco- logical parameters of car during its complex interactions with human beings and nature. AVTOVAZ Inc. (trade mark: LADA) is the biggest Russian pas- senger car manufacturer. It produces about 75% of all national pas- senger cars. For 3 decades of its history, the factory has made more than 20 million passenger cars, 1/3 of them have been exported, mainly to European countries. AVTOVAZ R&amp;D Center specialists were involved in methodi- cal analyses on dismantling of all LADA cars manufactured. The fastening elements, tools used for dismantling, and the time for dis- mantling were compared to the same components of different LADA models. In addition, a number of foreign cars (FIAT, OPEL, DAEWOO, RENAULT) were disassembled and studied to compare dismantling peculiarities of LADA models and foreign cars. As a result of the work, all fastening parts were classified by groups according to their ease of dismantling. The recommendations on improving assembly/disassembly methods and fastening parts were used for the development of new LADA cars, which are planned to be produced in future. 2001-01-3756. (P-365) Determining the recycling rate of a work machine. Saija Vatanen, Jussi Lehtonen, and Hannele Ton- teri, VIT Manufacturing Technology. The end-of-life treatment must be specified first to determine the recycling rate of a product. The recycling rate is the proportion of end-of-life scrap of a product's mass that is going to be recycled. In calculation of recycling rate it is assumed that the recycling strat- egy is based on materials recycling into primary materials. Recy- cling practices of different countries affects to recycling rate. Deter- mining the absolute value of recycling rate is far more complicated process and might turn out to be an unresolved process. The recy- cling rate can be considered as an effective indicator in the assess- ment of environmental properties of product. The benefits of deter- mining recycling rate are, e.g., clarity and simplicity. 2001-01-3757. (P-365) RESHMENT-An ASR process for maximized recycling, reuse and recovery. Fried Säuert, VOEST- ALPINE Industrieanlagenbau GmbH &amp; Co.; Martin Schaub, CT Umwelttechnik AG; Franz Christ, Thommen + Co AG; and Jürgen Ritter, FPR Holding AG. End-of-life vehicles (ELVs) are usually shredded so that the raw materials, which are mainly metals comprising between 70 and 80% of the entire vehicle weight, can be recycled. The remainder is referred to as automotive shredder residue (ASR) and contains a broad mixture of many different materials in modern vehicles, such as glass, all kinds of plastics and rubbers, different types of tissues and filler materials. There is also a certain amount of non-separated metals and heavy metals. ASR is usually landfilled, however a lot of mechanical and thermal processes have been developed and tested in order to meet the same requirements imposed by regula- tions for ASR which are valid for other wastes such as municipal solid waste. The RESHMENT process is a combined mechanical and thermal process which aims at maximizing reuse, recycling and recovery of products and energy from ASR in order to meet the chal- lenging recycling requirements stipulated in the most recent EU reg- ulations on used-car recycling. 2001-01-3758. (P-365) Contribution of passenger cars and trucks to CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC and HFC emissions. Norbert Metz , BMW Group. Global and regional greenhouse gas emissions of natural and anthropogenic origin are estimated. Biogenic CO2 emissions are globally 770 billion t/year and anthropogenic CO2 emissions in 2000 are 28 billion t/year. Assuming that biogenic emissions are in a equi- librium only manmade CO2 emissions for comparisons are used. Regarding only the anthropogenic C2 emission road transport con- tributes globally about 10% and regionally in Europe about 20%. The contribution of road transport on the total CH4 emission is glob- ally less than 0.2%, regionally about 1% regarding only the anthro- pogenic CH4-emission road transport contribute globally less than 0.5% and regionally in Europe about 2%. The contribution of road transport on the total N20 emission is globally less than 0.3%, regionally less than 2%, regarding only the anthropogenic N20 emission road transport contribute globally less than 1% and regionally in Europe about 10%. The contribution of road transport on the total CFC-emission is globally less than 0.1%, regionally about 0.2%. All CFC emissions are anthropogenic. 458</page><page sequence="458">2001-01-3759-2001-01-3766 2001-01-3759. (P-365) Estimation of the total fuel economy and CO2 emission from vehicles at the center of local city. Hideyuki Tsunemoto, Hiromi Ishitani, Shuji Hatakeyama, and Toshio Kotaka, Kitami Institute of Technology . Improvements in the fuel economy of passenger cars and trucks contribute directly to CO2 reductions. Recently low fuel consump- tion cars are being developed, however most cars are still old types. This study estimates the effect of new engine types, lightweight cars, kinds of fuel, and running conditions on fuel economy and CO2 emissions with anew calculation method of fuel consumption. In this calculation method the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are easily calculated from the indicated thermal efficiency and friction mean effective pressure for different engine types and sizes. By this method the overall fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from small passenger cars to heavy-duty trucks were estimated for roads through the center of a small city. As a result, the influence of new type engines, lightweight cars, fiiel properties and driving patterns on fuel economy and CO2 was made clear. 2001-01-3760. (P-365) Quantification of local ozone produc- tion attributable to automobile hydrocarbon emissions. Stanslav V. Bohac and Dennis N. Assanis, University of Michigan. When automobile hydrocarbons are exhausted into the atmo- sphere in the presence of NOx and sunlight, ground-level ozone is formed. While researchers have used Maximum Incremental Reac- tivity (MIR) factors to estimate ozone production, this procedure often overestimates Local Ozone Production (LOP) because it does not consider local atmospheric conditions. In this paper, an enhanced MIR methodology for estimating actual LOP attributable to a vehicle in a particular ozone problem area is presented. In addi- tion to using tabulated MIR factors, the procedure also uses local hydrocarbon reaction terms and a relative mechanistic reactivity term that account for local atmospheric conditions. Through this approach, the effects of hydrocarbon reaction rates, hydrocarbon residence times, and prevailing HC/NOx ratio are accounted for. The procedure is intended to enable automotive engineers to more realistically estimate actual local ozone production resulting from hydrocarbon emissions. 2001-01-3761. (P-365) Regional trade and emission gas in Asian automobile industry. Keiko Hirota and Kiyoyuki Minato , Japan Automobile Research Institute. This paper is an attempt to estimate the traffic demand of private vehicles in the Philippines and Thailand toward 2030. Estimation of road traffic volume is one of the most important elements for deter- mining fuel consumption and emission gas levels. The level of pas- senger car ownership is still low, but there has been a distinct shift toward passenger cars due to the lack of mass transport. In Asian countries, inspection and maintenance and emission standards are the most important policy measures. The projections of car stock are evaluated as the emissions of PM, CO and NOx by applying these policy measures in the case of Thailand. 2001-01-3762. (P-365) Sustainable materials in automotive applications. Wulf Peter Schmidt, Claudia Duranceau, and John Sullivan, Ford Motor Co. Ford Motor Company has established within its global Ford Product Development System (FPDS), a vehicle product system which strives to maximize recyclability and recoverability while minimizing the total environmental impact of vehicles. One aspect of how the automotive industry can move towards sustainability is to include sustainable materials like recycled and natural materials in its products as well as in its manufacturing process. Additional examples of using materials imparting low life cycle impact exist in both in the US and Europe. By introducing sustainable materials in mass production, huge figures for reducing environmental bur- dens result, for example, worldwide 140 million pounds of recycled non-metallic materials have been used just for Ford vehicles alone. 2001-01-3763. (P-365) TPE radiator components from post- consumer tires. Monica H. Prokopyshen and Mark E. Deangelis, DaimlerChrysler Corporation ; and Andrew Haber and Al Zander, NRI Industries. Over 250 million tires are scrapped in the United States each year. Tires have been a problematic scrap because they have been designed to resist destruction, and have a tendency to float upwards in landfills. Improper storage has resulted in tire fires ~ an even more problematic environmental concern than unsightly piles which can serve as breeding grounds for insect vectors. A better solution is to recover materials for use in new components. Not only does this resolve the landfill issue, but it also serves to conserve resources, while returning an economic benefit to society. This paper traces the introduction of tire material recovery at NRI Industries and DaimlerChrysler Corporation (DCC), the devel- opment of the infrastructure and materials, and the launch of the Jeep Grand Cherokee thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) radiator seals, comprised of post-consumer tire crumb. Technological and econom- ical feasibility of post-consumer tire material is demonstrated with a case study of a benchmark automotive TPE. The technical chal- lenges of the product, performance characteristics and environmen- tal benefits are discussed. 2001-01-3764. (P-365) A qualitative life cycle assessment of the automotive tire. Sirley Wilma Bizarria Faga , Marialice Thibes Ronzoni Ciuccio, and José Barboza, General Motors Brasil ; and Marcelo Costa Almeida, Sati Manrich, and José Angelo Rodriques Gregolin, Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos. The life cycle of the automotive tire is assessed in this paper. The designed system includes the following stages: raw materials extrac- tion, materials processing, components manufacture, tire assembly and curing, first and second use, retreading, disposal and, final desti- nation. The geographical scope is the Brazilian territory. The materi- als under consideration are natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, polybutadiene rubber and carbon black. Six impact categories are discussed in the automotive tire life cycle, namely electricity con- sumption, global warming, soil and water contamination, atmo- spheric emissions, land use and human health hazard. Opportunities for impact minimization were searched on the basis of new technol- ogies that have been developed in the tire industry. 2001-01-3765. (P-365) Environmentally adapted lubricants, vehicles for change in the transformation to sustainable indus- trial practices. Thomas Norrby and Milan Kopp, Statoil Lubricants Research &amp; Development. One aspect of the evolution of environmental thinking can be described or exemplified by analyzing the use of Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (EALs). Lubricants can in many cases be a sig- nificant environmental aspect of many business activities. The trans- formation to more widespread use of EALs thus could well be a con- tribution to sustainable development. Also, it could (and should!) be a part of the continual improvements undertaken by an ISO 14000- certified actor. The EALs become a starting point for further 'envi- ronmental work' and changes. One example is found in Swedish for- est industry. 2001-01-3766. (P-365) Sustainability and steel recycling. L. Brimacombe and P. Shonfield, Corns Research, Development &amp; Technology ; and M. Buridard, International Iron and Steel Institute. The International Iron and Steel Institute (USI) has developed life-cycle assessment (LCA) tools to help understand the benefits of steel recycling. The key themes important to sustainability are that: - Steel recycling avoids environmental impacts associated with pro- ducing steel from virgin material sources; - The amount of steel which is recycled/reused at end-of-life is crucial to the sustainability of the steel application; - Whilst all steels contain recycled content, the level has little or no impact on the sustainability of the steel application in a life-cycle context. 459</page><page sequence="459">2001-01-3766-2001-01-3778 There is a misperception that specifying recycled steel is more environmentally friendly than specifying virgin material steel. When looked at in the broader context of sustainability, analysis shows that recycled content is irrelevant providing that the steel is reused or recycled at the end-of-life of the application. 2001-01-3767. (P-365) Sustainability assessment of the devel- opment of the new X-Type Jaguar. Peter Braithwaite, Ove Arup &amp; Partners International Ltd. Sustainability is becoming a mainstream business issue, which has been promoted, in the United Kingdom, by the Government's development of a Strategy for Sustainability. In response to the chal- lenge of bringing sustainability down to an easily understandable issue, which business can apply to their mainstream decision- making, a management information tool SPeAR™ has been devel- oped to demonstrate the sustainability of a project, product or orga- nization. The use of SPeAR™ is demonstrated by the case study of Jag- uar's refurbishment of the Halewood Plant formerly used by Ford for the production of the Escort. It demonstrates how sustainability can now be monitored in a meaningful way. 2001-01-3768. (P-365) Future heavy-duty diesel lubricants for low-emission engines. F. Stunnenberg , P. Kleijwegt, and A. W. L. de Vries Feyens , Chevron Oronite Technology. Meeting future emission legislation for heavy-duty diesel engines is expected to require the use of various exhaust after- treatment systems. In order to maintain their functionality these devices may not tolerate some of the key elements used in lubricant formulations today: sulfur, phosphorus and sulfated ash. In this paper, we discuss the excellent performance and ramifica- tions of prototype lubricants meeting some possible requirements for sulfur, phosphorus and sulfated ash. 2001-01-3769. (P-365) Innovative testing device for ultra-low fuel permeation systems. Viviane Adam and Pierre Delbarre , 77 Group Automotive Systems - Technology Center GmbH. New regulations on Hydrocarbon (HC) emissions have set more stringent requirements for fuel systems evaporative emissions. This creates a need for developing new and more efficient material struc- tures able to offer enhanced barrier properties to fuels. Such low levels of permeation rates have proven to reach the lower detection limits of most of the existing test equipment or methods, and have required the development of innovative techniques in order to char- acterize new materials or structures by measuring their permeability coefficients, or to be able to compare various constructions for com- ponents or sub-assemblies of the fuel system. A new device has been designed and built in our Technology Center in Rastatt (Germany) and proves to offer an outstanding pre- cision capability in measuring ultra-low permeation rates (less than 0.5 mg/day). Its operating process and the easy control on key input parameters offer a large flexibility in terms of measurement resolu- tion and time. The system has been successfully adapted for intrinsic material permeability measurement and to component evaluation, ranging from small parts (valves, connectors, caps, ...) to a full-size tank (70 liters). After reviewing existing techniques and devices used to measure permeation rates on fuel systems, the current paper will give a detailed description of the new process, precise the mathematical model applied to process experimental data and finally introduce some practical examples in various configurations. 2001-01-3770. (P-365) Paint simulation tool for designing sus- tainable painting processes. Matthias Harsch , LCS Life Cycle Sim- ulation GmbH. Concern-specific decision-making processes can be externally supported by engineering services or by tailor-made software tools. The Paint Simulation Tool is such kind of a software. It consists of technical analysis, cost calculation and life cycle assessment (LCA). 2001-01-3771. (P-365) Romanian reefer trade face to face with efficiency and environment. F e iza Memet and Gheorghe Batrânca, Constantza Maritime University. Marine refrigeration plants must address two major matters: effi- ciency and environment. This paper approaches efficiency from the ice storage point of view. Because this technology performs well on shore, we propose to adjust it for on board the ship. On the basis of the excellent results obtained by CEMAGREF laboratories, we made a calculation for an Ice Balls Storage System adapted for a fishing vessel, in order to perform in the Romanian fishing sector. The results was a smaller distribution ductwork. The necessary daily refrigerant requirements are 47% smaller than a conventional sys- tem. The environment is one of the big challenges that Romanian reefer is facing. This is why we present ammonia as being a promis- ing refrigerant for the reefer trade. The comparison made in this paper between R22, a traditional refrigerant for the Romanian fleet, and ammonia shows that ammonia is the perfect alternative refriger- ant to R22. 2001-01-3772. (P-365) Are lightweight materials really envi- ronmentally friendly? A software tool for the assessment of the best alternative technologies in the next generation of vehicles. Silvia Lazzari , Fiat Research Center ; and Giancarlo Foglia , Fiat Auto T.D. Automotive components designed and manufactured with light- weight materials are becoming a means whereby the CO2 emission reduction targets in the use phase can be met. On the other hand, such alternative materials might generate higher environmental impacts and a greater energy consumption in the production phase. As a consequence, the use phase is becoming less critical than the manufacturing phase; moreover, the choice of lighter materials might be or not a winning solution depending on several other fac- tors, which can be managed and compared only through the use of dedicated softwares, like the one developed in Fiat Auto. 2001-01-3773. (P-365) Integrating design for environment (DfE) and extended product responsibility (EPR). Jacquetta J. Lee , Rolls-Royce pic. This paper is a discussion document regarding the integration of DfE and EPR into highly constrained design situations. It discusses the benefits of EPR and improved environmental design of products with many and sometimes opposing influences over the product life cycle that could result. 2001-01-3776. (P-365) Life cycle assessment (LCA) in strate- gic risk management. Hartmut Schöch , Harald Florin , and Michael Betz, PE Europe GmbH. LCA as standardized methodology offers information which is very helpful besides the environmental analysis. The strategic man- agement system in companies needs enormous amounts of different types of information to realize corporate risks and chances in very early stages. The following approach combines the approved meth- odology of LCA, which mostly is used as an operative tool, with strategic economic models from the market perspective. This leads to an interdisciplinary model for strategic risk management which is a completely new field of application for LCA and an also new, efficient way of generation and structure of information. 2001-01-3778. (P-365) Recycling of aluminum and magne- sium parts from used cars: Legislative frame and consequences for metallurgy and material design. H. Antrekowitsch , G. Hanko , and P. Paschen , University of Leoben. The final version of the European guideline on used cars has been published. It has a strong influence on the design and production of automobiles. The automotive industry is expected to use more recy- cled material to extend the market for recycling materials. The most important prescription from the standpoint of automo- bile producers and motor vehicle importers is certainly the obliga- tion to take back old vehicles without cost. This is a strong reason 460</page><page sequence="460">2001-01-3778-2001-01-3808 for an increase in using aluminum and magnesium in vehicles because of the high value of these metals. Another is the reduction of fuel consumption by reduction of weight. Engine, running gear, seat frames, etc., have been increasingly made of lightweight metals. In future it depends on production technology like construction, pro- cessing, coating and joining methods how fast aluminum and mag- nesium can substitute other materials in the automobile. As a result these mentioned forces lead to an increasing amount of light metal scrap, which has to be recycled. One of the focal research activities of the Department for Nonfer- rous Metallurgy is recycling of aluminum and magnesium scrap. Different materials like coated components, alloys with high content of alloying elements and composites are investigated. Further con- sideration is taken on the reduction of specific energy consumption. Trends in the processing and recycling of light metals with respect to furnace development are also shown. 2001-01-3779. (P-365) Strategic life cycle management (SLCM): Eco-inno vation strategies as a response to the new environmental regulations on cars in Europe. Christophe Abras- sart and Hélène Teulon, PricewaterhouseCoopers. With the upcoming environmental regulations in Europe, car manufacturers are facing new strategic issues: how far should they get involved in the ELVs treatment and recycling? How to distribute the recycling targets among the 20,000 parts of the car? How to con- trol the use of regulated substance over the whole vehicle? How to make technical decisions which make sense in the long run? To answer this specific question, a tool is proposed in this paper, the Strategic Life Cycle Management matrix (SLCM). SLCM is based on both a life cycle cost approach and an analysis of the maturity/ readiness of the considered technology. Application examples are given to demonstrate how this tool is operational. 2001-01-3808. Study of an air conditioning system for a small hybrid vehicle based on the absorption principle. Chiara Bocca- letti , University Roma Tre ; and Leone Martellucci , University of Rome - La Sapienza . The definition of an absorption system suitable for small hybrid vehicles is introduced. Various alternatives have been considered, taking critical aspects into account, such as the poor space availabil- ity, the shape constraints, the limits on the total weight. System operation has been simulated under various running conditions. The feasibility of the different possible solutions is ascertained. Advan- tages and disadvantages of each alternative layout are discussed in the paper and a final choice is performed. 461</page></plain_text>
