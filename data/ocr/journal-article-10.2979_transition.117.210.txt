Cristina de Middel is a photographer whose work investigates photography’s am- biguous relationship to truth. Blending documentary and conceptual photographic  practices, her work asks the audience to question the language and veracity of pho- tography as a document, and plays with reconstructions and archetypes that blur the  border between reality and fiction. de Middel produced the critically acclaimed series  The Afronauts in 2012, which explored the history of a failed space program in Zambia  in the 1960s through staged reenactments of obscure narratives. De Middel has exhib- ited internationally and has received numerous awards and nominations, including  PhotoFolio Arles 2012, the Deutsche Börse Prize, POPCAP’ 13, and the Infinity Award  from the International Center of Photography in New York.

Faith47s first solo exhibition, Fragments of a Burnt History (2012, Da- vid Krut Gallery, Johannesburg) considered the transformation of Johannesburg into  a more representative African city, exposing the harsh realities of day-to-day life and  capturing the remnants of South Africa’s complex history in a personal and symbolic  manner.

Hinkle is an interdisciplinary, Los Angeles-based visual artist, writer, and  performer interested in the complexities of history and power. Her work reconstructs  narratives of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century West African ethnographic  photography. Through the embellishment of these photos, Hinkle uses the metaphor  of disease to represent colonialism and the poetic interpretation of a virus entering  the body. Hinkle interrogates the power dynamics between the gaze, the subject, and  the viewer. Her drawings upon these photographs serve as a means to protect, not to  consume, the women’s flesh. Her artwork and performances of experimental texts have  been reviewed by the The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Artforum, The Huffington Post,  and LA Weekly, and she was a finalist for the 2013 Los Angeles Artadia Award.

Email:  sarahjessicajohnson@berkeley.edu Rym Khene was born in 1983. In her academic research as well as in her artistic prac- tice of photography, she questions the memory of cities, and looks at the traces, both  apparent and secret, of their dwellers. She tries to capture the ways the physical and  imaginary spaces resonate with each other, and how city streets and walls are marked  and sometimes scarred by stories of their inhabitants. Khene lives in Paris, and is  completing a PhD thesis in Literature on the poetics of urban space in a context of  violence. www.rymkhene.com Bodys Isek Kingelez (1948–2015) constructed architectural models of urban spaces  to explore the sprawling, anarchic chaos of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the  Congo. In the 1970s, Kingelez worked as a mask restorer at the National Museum in  Kinshasa while continuing his post-secondary school studies. After losing his position  at the museum, in 1977 he began to fabricate his meticulous architectural models out  of colored and decorated cardboard, paper, wood, plastic, and other found materials.  Called “extrêmes maquettes” for their strange, finely articulated forms, the models  combine European and African stylistic details. By 1992 he had created more than  three hundred maquettes. His thought-provoking architectural visions have been  shown internationally in numerous solo and group exhibitions since the late 1980s.

Gonçalo Mabunda is interested in the collective memory of his country, Mozambique,  which has only recently emerged from a long and terrible civil war. He works with  </page> <page sequence="5"> arms recovered in 1992 at the end of the sixteen-year conflict that divided the region.  In his sculpture, he gives anthropomorphic forms to AK47s, rocket launchers, pistols  and other objects of destruction. The deactivated weapons of war carry strong political  connotations, yet the beautiful objects he creates also convey a positive reflection on the  transformative power of art and the resilience and creativity of African civilian societies.  Mabunda’s work has been exhibited at Museum Kunst Palast, Dusseldorf, Hayward  Gallery, London, Pompidou, Paris, Mori Art Museum, Tokyo and the Johannesburg  Art Gallery, Johannesburg among others.

Email:  peacemedie@gmail.com Jeanine Michna-Bales’ work belies its initial simplicity and seeks to tell a narrative that  explores the relationships between what has occurred or is occurring in our society  and how people have chosen to react to those events. Her images are intended to be  viewed in a series—each serving as a vital component in helping to tell the story. Before  becoming a full-time artist, Jeanine worked as an award-winning ad agency art director.  She uses her design background to create visually engaging documentary series that  communicate her ideas. Moké (Monsengwo Kejwamfi) (1950–2001) was a leading artist of the school of popular  painting that arose in Kinshasa during the decade following present-day Democratic  Republic of the Congo’s independence in 1960. In need of work after arriving in the  city as a ten-year-old orphan the year the nation gained independence, Moké taught  himself to paint landscapes on discarded scraps of cardboard. A 1965 painting of Gen- eral Mobutu waving to the crowds at an Independence Day parade launched Moké’s  career and earned him a presidential grant. He established a studio in an area known  for its billboard and advertising painters. With a sympathetic and humorous eye, he  took the daily life of the urban environment as his inspiration. His paintings have been  shown internationally. Aimé Mpané mines the theme of power and vulnerability in society as he engages with  the past and present. He was born in1968 into a family of master artists in Kinshasa,  Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Frédéric Nauczyciel is a French artist who works with photography, video, and perfor- mance in Paris and the United States. Throughout his practice, he has explored the  </page> <page sequence="6"> complexity of social life, be it rural or urban. He employs a nuanced type of portrai- ture that treats his protagonists in the context of the fabric of their surroundings. His  most recent project, The Fire Flies, explores the underground black culture of voguing  in the ghettos of Baltimore and Paris. He was moved by Black American and French  homosexuals and transsexuals who invent themselves through performance and the  poetics of survival that he encountered. Nauczyciel emphasizes this expanded meaning  of performance with his images vivantes, asserting that the very ability to project yourself  into the world is what makes you real. Charles K.
