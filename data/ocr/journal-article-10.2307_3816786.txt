<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Account Mee Man": The Incarnation in Paradise Lost By PETER A. FIORE, O.F.M. MILTON'S TREATMENT of the soteriological aspects of the doctrine of the Redemption is remarkably subtle; it attests to the depth of thought in his theological system, and it gives further evidence of his nearly total con- formity to the orthodox Christian tradition that gives dramatic enrich- ment to his epic of lost paradise. The Incarnation was the means where- by the Redemption was to be fulfilled. But the actual motive for the In- carnation, which has a direct bearing on the doctrine of the Redemption, presents a controversy that has intrigued thinkers down through the ages, Milton not excluded. The Incarnation was dictated by two prin- cipal motives: the glorification of Christ and compassion for the misery of mankind. But the problem is which one of these two motives out- weighed the other. One school of thought places the Incarnation prior to all else and independent of the fall of man; another places it wholly con- tingent upon man's transgression. Those who posit the Incarnation as first conceive of the absolute predestination of Christ and his divine king- dom as primary to everything and all other divine decrees, with the per- mission of the sin of Adam and the mission of Christ as passible Redeem- er of mankind as secondary.' Those who relegate the Incarnation to a secondary position hold that God created the universe without regard to Christ, decreed subsequently to permit sin, and lastly determined on the Incarnation of the Logos for the purpose of redeeming the human race.2 The first school maintains that God's principal motive in decreeing the Incarnation was the dignity and glorification of Christ. The universe 'Despite the fact that the teaching is found in the works of any number of the Church Fathers, Augustine particularly, the theory was actually formulated as a doctrine by medieval theologians. The theory originated with Abbot Rupert of Deutz (De Gloria et Hon. Filii Hominis, Libri XIII; De Trinitate, III, 20), was adopted by Albert the Great (Com- ment. in Quatuor Libros Sent., III, dist. 20, art. 4), and developed fully by Duns Scotus (Comment. in Quatuor Libros Sent., III, dist. 7, qu. 3). It found ardent defenders in Ambrose Catharinus (De Praedestin. Eximia Christi, Lyons, 1542), Ysambert, Bernardine of Siena, Francis de Sales (De l'amour de Dieu, II, 4), and Suarez (De Incarn., disp. 5). Relatively mod- ern thinkers who championed this school were Faber, Gay, Bougaud, Schell, Risi, and Du Cappucce (Etudes Franciscaines, 1890, 1goo; cf. Pesch, Das Suhneleiden unseres gdttl. Eriisers, pp. 113 et seqq.). 2The medieval theologians Thomas Aquinas (Comment. in Quatuor Libros Sent., III, dist. i, qu. i, art. 3) and Bonaventure (Comment. in Quatuor Libros Sent., III, dist. i, art. 2, qu. 2) define specifically and defend at length this more traditional view and find support from Gregory of Valentia, Vasquez, Petavius, Toletus, De Lugo, and Lessius; see De Praedestin.

The strength of this position lies in the argument that the end cannot be inferior to the means devised for its attainment-that is, that the Incar- nation merely served the purpose of the Redemption. The other school ascribes the Incarnation of the Logos primarily to God's mercy and maintains that the Fall was an indispensable condition of the Incarna- tion. It is interesting to note that elements of both schools are found in the soteriology of Augustine and Milton. Augustine, along with several other Church Fathers, held, for example, that the nature of matrimony, as an image of Christ's union with his church, was revealed to Adam in Paradise-a position which implicitly argues in favor of the former school.3 From this teaching, one can conclude that Augustine felt that Christ's appearance on earth must not be conceived as conditional upon the Fall. He says, "Conjugium etiam in statu innocentiae, si homo non peccasset, futurum sacramentum conjunctionis Christi cum Ecclesia."4 If matrimony would still be a symbol of Christ's union with his church even in the state of innocence, then the incarnate Christ would neces- sarily have come regardless of the Fall. He would have come not as re- deemer but as king and head of God's mystical and visible church. And when Milton argues that "Christ is the head of the mystical church, so no one is rightly or can possibly be at the head of the visible church, ex- cept Christ,"5 he is saying in effect that God's mystical church, regardless of what happened in Eden, existed from the beginning of creation and had Christ as its ordained head. God's church, then, as it existed in the preternatural state, had Christ as its head just as God's church, in our postlapsarian world, has Christ as its head. The problem for a number of medieval and Renaissance theologians was whether there would have been a church if mankind had persevered in its unfallen state. There appears to be nothing in Milton's theology to indicate that the poet felt there would not be. In fact, commenting on the mystical and invisible church, Milton asserts, "The body of Christ is mystically one, so it fol- lows that the communion of his members must be mystic. It need not be subject to spatial considerations: it includes people from many remote countries, and from all ages since the creation of the world."6 The clause "since the creation of the world" certainly indicates that the Church, with Christ as its head, existed in the time of Adam and Eve's unfallen state, indeed before it; and if the marriage state was a symbol of Christ's 3De Nupt. et Conc., I, 21. 4Ibid. 5Christian Doctrine, in Yale Complete Prose (New Haven, 1953-), VI, 566; hereafter CP. 6Ibid., 500. 52</page><page sequence="3">INCARNATION IN PARADISE LOST union with his church, a teaching which Milton never questioned,7 then the poet is giving serious consideration to the first school in the soterio- logical controversy and is arguing for the primacy of Christ. It is most unlikely that Milton would hold that God's church was a postlapsarian fabrication, that its creation was occasioned by the fall of Adam, and that the leadership and kingship of Christ were wholly dependent upon the sin of Adam. Furthermore, when Milton teaches that unfallen Adam and Eve, if they had persevered, could have moved into heaven as perfect humans (PL, VII, 154-161), a teaching peculiar to Bonaventure, it follows logi- cally that Christ, the head of all creation, could easily and gloriously have come to unfallen earth without any particular redemptive mission. In another instance, Milton argues, "Through Christ all things were made, both in heaven and earth, even the angels. In the beginning he was the word. He was God with God, and although he was not supreme, he was the firstborn of all creation. It follows that he must have existed before his incarnation,"8 and here he calls upon a text of St. Paul which theo- logians of the first school use as the scriptural basis for the primacy-of- Christ theory. "By him were all things created ... and he is before all, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the first born from the dead; that in all things he may hold preeminence" (Colossians i. 16 et seqq.). The Pauline authority of the firstborn of every creature can only be interpreted by these theo- logians thus: that Christ holds first place in the divine economy, that the world of angels and men was reserved to the last, and that the Incarna- tion cannot have been subordinate to the Creation and Redemption but, on the contrary, must rank far above it. Indeed, Milton's awareness of this subtle teaching and his frequent allusions to this school of thought attest to the depth of his theological thinking. Yet nowhere in Christian Doctrine do we find the poet adopting this theory or giving it explicit treatment as a possible motive for the Incarnation. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the many references to "first born," "kingship," and "anointed king" in the treatise and the epic. All we can say, there- fore, is that Milton, like the Patristics and unlike the medieval theologi- ans who actually formulated it as a doctrine, was aware of the teaching at least to the point of having the attributes of "kingship" and "first born" lend added dimensions to his portrayal of Christ. But despite the many references in Augustine's and Milton's thought to this first school, the weight of the evidence from their works goes to the more traditional theory. Augustine's investigation of the Redemp- 7See Christian Doctrine, CP, VI, 500; Reason of Church Government, CP, I, 755; Tetra- chordon, CP, II, 607; Colasterion, CP, II, 739. 8Christian Doctrine, CP, VI, 419. 53</page><page sequence="4">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY tion and the motive for the Incarnation is based on the passage in De Peccato Originali, "Dominum Jesum Christum non aliam ob causam venisse ... salvos feceret, liberaret, redimerit, illuminaret"9 and another passage in the Enchiridion which teaches "per incarnatum Deum revo- caretur."'0 The Enchiridion, De Peccato Originali, and De Gratia Christi contain lengthy discourses on the fall of Adam as being the chief motive that prompted God to decree the Incarnation. Milton's discus- sion of the Redemption in Christian Doctrine is based on the concept that the original sin of Adam occasioned the coring of the Redeemer. Concerning the purpose of the Incarnation, he says, "The aim of this miraculous conception was to evade the pollution of Adam's sin."1 And in discussing the manhood of Christ, he maintains that there are reasons given most distinctly in Scripture why Christ should be incarnate, and the six citations he uses from Paul's Epistles to the Hebrews and Corin- thians all pertain to the fallen state of man as occasioning the Incarna- tion.12 In Paradise Lost, Christ's mission is for the salvation of man: "Destin'd restorer of Mankind" (X.646) who "offer'd himself to die / For man's offense" (III.409-410). Yet the actual motive for the Incarna- tion can be found in the important passage, well thou know'st how dear To me are all my works, nor Man the least Though last created, that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, By losing thee a while, the whole Race lost. (III, 276-280) Also the sequence of events in Book III is simply a dramatization of this traditional theory. We have the Father and the Son discussing Satan's flight to Paradise; the Father explaining to the Son the fall of man, which has not yet taken place but exists in the Father's foreknowledge; and the Son insisting on his own Incarnation in order that he might atone for the Fall that is yet to come. Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; Account mee man; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom. (111.236-239) 9De Pecc. Orig., I. 26. iOEnch., CVIII. llChristian Doctrine, CP, VI, 428. 2Ibid., 426. 54</page><page sequence="5">INCARNATION IN PARADISE LOST The first theory, which groups the whole of creation around the God- head as the center of the universe, the highest and final revelation, the beginning and end of all things, recommends itself for its sublimity. But actually it is a theory inspired by a transcendent idealism and one of which Milton, despite a certain sympathy for it, was prbbably most sus- picious. The poet would have some difficulty in reconciling this theory with his teaching on the attributes of God and God's decrees in Christ- ian Doctrine. Milton warns readers to avoid the dangers that beset men of thinking of God in an "anthropopathetic" manner.l3 When in the natural order man examines some course of activity, he is forced to analyze, and to distinguish in his mind, his motives for acting, the incen- tives which prompted him to act, and the various aspects of the end he hoped to achieve by his activity. But this is invalid if it is applied too vigorously to God, whose activity and thinking are of an absolute wisdom and of transcending simplicity. Milton insists that "It is absurd, then, to separate God's decree or intention from his eternal resolution and fore- knowledge and give the former chronological priority. For God's fore- knowledge is simply his wisdom under another name, or that idea of all things which, to speak in human terms, he had in mind before he decreed anything."'4 The first theory, which implies that Adam's sin was a kind of intrusion or misfortune that upset the first set of plans God had made for man's happiness, is precisely the kind of chronological imposition on God's "eternal resolution" that Milton rejects. Milton felt that, as part of his absolute wisdom, God, in creating Adam and Eve, knew that Adam would sin; he also knew that he willed to redeem fallen man by the pas- sion and death of his Son, and that by the obedience of his death Christ would merit supreme glory for himself as the Lord of all things in heaven and earth. God made a progressive revelation of his plan, but there was no progression in the plan. He gradually unfolded in a temporal se- quence of different stages his one divine plan which we see realized in one long history. The absolute simplicity of God's being, acts, mind, and will transcend human being and activity, defy time and chronology. The first theory ignores the basic metaphysical principle that God does not know things, as men do, because they exist; on the contrary, things exist in the way they do, and are linked with each other as they are, sim- ply because they are part of the simplicity of God's own being. In the light then of Milton's teaching on God's decrees, their oneness and their eternity, the first theory would appear much too anthropomorphic in approach and would be contrary to traditional orthodoxy as found in Scripture, which teaches that God is one and his decrees are one and eternal. 3Ibid., 134. 14Ibi(., 154. 55</page><page sequence="6">HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY The second view, however, conforms to the facts as we know them from tradition, as does Paradise Lost. It is more solidly entrenched in the Scriptures, and we can be certain that Milton, with such authority buttressing this view, would be quite prone to mark his approval. Invari- ably, in Paradise Lost, when Milton speaks of the Son of God incarnate he points to the sin of Adam. But more important, the whole plan of sal- vation upon which Paradise Lost rests-that all men fell in Adam and all men are to rise in Christ-is actually the second view stated in traditional Augustinian terms. Man (Adam) is at the center of the epic. Paradise Lost and this tradition in no way ignore the dignity and glorification of Christ. The epic takes these for granted and then goes on to recognize the great and immense value of man in God's economy. Certainly with- out the fall of man Christ would be the King of Creation and, in a sense, it would be perfect for him to have this title in a sinless order, because he would be at the center of that order. But the whole economy of salvation, which is recounted for us in Scripture and tradition and which is the primary concern of Paradise Lost, does not pertain to a sinless order. It pertains to a present order which has as its central concern the whole of fallen mankind. Christ was given from all eternity the additional office of Redeemer as well as the office of King; consequently he was given addi- tional glory for an office that would demand a far greater expression of love. In the present and wider order of things, Christ is far more glori- ously Lord of mankind, which he not only created but also redeemed as the Word Incarnate, than he would have been in a sinless and, in a sense, limited order of things. So the greatest of all Christ's titles is "Redeemer of the human race." Thus to say that man's sin was the foreseen occasion of God's willing the Incarnation is not in any way to lessen the glory God willed to Christ as his Son. Indeed, it is an implementation of glory. In his absolute wisdom and eternity, God knew that sin was an intrinsic possibility to any created creature, man or angel, because of that crea- ture's limitations; so it is erroneous to posit, in the traditional view, that God willed the Incarnation on the chance and almost unforeseen occa- sion of this event ever taking place. It was not clance or unforeseen; it was all a part of his eternal resolution. As God is love, all his works neces- sarily express his love for his creatures. The Incarnation, then, the high- est act of love, takes upon itself all the more glory because it is a response to permitted sin and to the needs of mankind. This is the reality which prompted the Christian tradition to express its cry "0 felix culpa," and this is the reality which provides the foundation for the doctrine of the Redemption in Paradise Lost. 56</page></plain_text>
