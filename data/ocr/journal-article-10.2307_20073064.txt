<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scottish silver Edinburgh by TESSA MURDOCH Victoria and Albert Museum, London The exhibition Silver: Made in Scotland, 'the largest, most dazzling display of Scottish silver ever seen', is sparklingly laid out in the gener ously proportioned exhibition galleries at the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh (to 27th April), the last show before this venera ble building closes for refurbishment. The star of the display of over 350 pieces spanning seven centuries is a case devoted to mazers, remarkable survivals of the melting down of silver during the religious wars of the 1640s. A common form of drinking vessel, only nine Scottish examples survive and they have all been assembled here. The earliest, the Bute Mazer (cat. no.3.1; Fig.91), retains its original lid (not illustrated), but the rim, straps and foot were added in the sixteenth century. Most popular during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, mazers were status symbols treasured by merchants and burgesses as much as by the landed gentry. Silver smithing was primarily an urban craft. A supreme example of urban patronage and manufacture is the Heriot Loving Cup, made by Robert Denneistoun of Edinburgh (no.3.7; Fig.92).

Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh). silver liner and strap mounts, this is a unique survival in Scodand, and is associated with George Heriot III. The cup was presented to the governors of George Heriot's school in 1792 and is still used at the school's anni versary dinner in June to toast the 'Immortal Memory of the Founder'. Although a high proportion of the pieces were made in Edinburgh, where the gold smiths' trade has flourished under the author ity of the Incorporation of Goldsmiths for 550 years, another stunning display, presented as a buffet with tiered shelves, is devoted to other Scottish burghs where silver was made from the fifteenth century onwards. There the goldsmiths belonged to local Incorporations of Hammermen, and their trade flourished from the late seventeenth century until the late eighteenth century (their privileges were finally abolished in 1846), with principal centres in Glasgow, Ayr, Perth, Montrose, Aberdeen and Banff. Local town marks iden tifying the origin of pieces are often based on the town's coat of arms; for Inverness this was a camel. The range of silver includes examples of the quaich, a two-handled drink ing vessel, the one from Aberdeen (1681-82; no.5.3) exquisitely engraved inside with flowers, foliage and birds. The Hundy spor ran (no.5.38), mounted in silver in the early eighteenth century by William Scott II of Elgin, bears on the silver cande the coat of arms of Scodand's premier Catholic peer, Alexander, Marquess of Hundy (2nd Duke of Gordon in 1716), and his wife, Lady Henri etta Mordaunt. Lord Hundy allegedly wore the sporran and targe (not exhibited) at the Batde of Sherifrmuir (13 th November 1715) when he fought with the Earl of Mar for the Jacobites. Hundy patronage extended to sport. Both the ist and 2nd Dukes of Gordon used the Hundy races to express their support for the exiled House of Stuart. Held every September between 1695 and 1749, the Charles Fair, at which the races took place, named in honour of Charles II, provided the appropriate royal initials with which to embellish the Hundy Prize sword hilts. Each is associated with either the 1715 or 1745 Jacobite rebellions. Two of these swords are displayed in a section entided Sporting Glories ? the trophies range from newly fashionable teapots, tea-kettles and chocolate pots to the more traditional two-handled cups. The display is enlivened by a mid-nineteenth century painting of Old Leith Races, painted to commemorate the final race run on Leith Sands outside Edinburgh in 1859, juxtaposed with the King's Prize gold teapot of 1736, from the Assheton Bennett Collection, Manchester City Art Galleries (no.9.16). 92.

Charles, ist Earl of Hopetoun (1681?1742), was overcharged for chasing on his fashionable tea service by James Ker of Edinburgh in 1734-45. The patron anno tated the goldsmith's bill 'deduct one half the workmanship it having been refer'd to the London price'. The 'uniquely Scottish egg shaped coffee pots' dating between 1719 and 1768, displayed as a tiered group of six, take on an anthropomorphic existence as their S-scroll tripod legs suggest they are ready to advance towards the user. They were prob ably the preferred means of serving coffee, as the spirit burner beneath would ensure that the drink was served as hot as possible. The highlight of the display devoted to the Victorian period is the work of David MacGregor of Perth. In 1893 he was commis sioned by the Tenantry on the Breadalbane Estates to produce a silver vase to commemo rate the granting of the Knighthood of the Garter to Gavin, ist Marquess and 7th Earl of Breadalbane. The final design (reproduced on p. 13 5), drawn actual size, is displayed next to the vase (no.6.25). The loan from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in Lon don of MacGregor's engraved plaque of Princess Alexandra, wife of Edward, Prince of Wales, is an appropriate companion (no.6.28). Institutional presentation silver includes the fifteenth-century maces from the University of St Andrews (nos.8.1 and 8.2). Ceremonial silver includes the Edinburgh-made gold coronation ampulla used for the coronation as king of Scodand of Charles I at Holyrood Abbey in 1633, and two Glasgow-made silver trumpets dating from the 1660s played at state and civic occasions (nos.8.10 and 8.11). The section devoted to church silver is geographically wide-ranging and concentrates mainly on silver made for the reformed church. The bread basin (no.7.7) from Holy Trinity church, Edinburgh, made in 1633, is beautifully engraved with a communion table set with a bread plate, two cups and two flagons. The mid-sixteenth century Nurem burg Cup (no.7.13) from St John's kirk, Perth, recendy acquired by the Perth Museum and Art Gallery, demonstrates the close con nections maintained with the Continent. The latest examples of ecclesiastical Scottish silver on show date from the 18 80s. Given the wealth of contemporary talent in this field, it is disappointing that this has not yet attracted any exciting sacred commissions. The exhibition ends with a range of silver made this century. The Millennium Collec tion for Bute House consists of table silver made for the use of Scodand's first minister; 'Silver of the Stars' is contemporary silver designed for celebrities (Fig.93) including Sean Connery, Ewan McGregor and Lulu, which was shown in London in April 2007 and has since travelled the world to great acclaim. This is its first showing in Scodand. This wide-ranging and accessible exhibi tion deserves to be seen by scholars, collectors and the general public. The accompanying catalogue provides a lively yet scholarly commentary which will stand as the best introduction to the subject and a mine of information for future reference.1 1 Catalogue: Silver: Made in Scotland.
