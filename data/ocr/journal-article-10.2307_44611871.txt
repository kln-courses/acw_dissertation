Weiss Naval Biodynamic Lab. F. Lavaste Laboratoire de Biomécanique de l'ENSAM C. Tarrière Departement Biomédical de l'Automobile Abstract Head neck responses from volunteer experiments, as obtained in various loading directions by the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory, represent a unique set of data in the field of biomechanical research. From this a set of volunteer thoracic (Tl) and head responses were selected as a reference for this study. Two loading conditions were considered i.e. frontal and lateral directions. The objective of this study is to develop a finite element model of the human neck in frontal and lateral directions. The number of elements in the model was kept low in order to reduce the processing time for simulation and to minimize damping problems. The structure of the model is as follows : the vertebrae and the head were considered as rigid bodies. The interface between vertebrae such as discs and different ligaments are modelled by brick and spring elements. The passive action of the muscles are taken into account when determining the stiffness characteristics of the ligaments. Satisfactory results were obtained in terms of kinematic responses of the head (comparison with NBDL data) in frontal and lateral directions. Further investigations are needed on the modélisation of the muscles to allow for injury prediction. This paper describes the characteristics of this model, the rationale behind the definition of model elements, and the performance compared with the volunteer reference. Introduction The neck, due to its composition and function, is a complex part of the human body consisting of vertebral elements, ligaments and muscles. This segment plays an essential role in the occupant's head response in the event of impact. To determine the involvement of this segment through accident research, an analysis was performed on frontal impacts which occurred in France (1). This analysis shows that out of 1077 cases of front-seat restrained occupants, 207 accident victims had neck injuries with AIS greater than or equal to 1. Most of these injuries are not very serious (184 cases of AIS = 1). Compared with other segments (head, thorax, legs), the neck ranks sixth or seventh in terms of SAIS-* (see Table 1), depending on whether the driver or the front passenger is considered. On the other hand, the importance of neck injuries in accidents can not be limited to AIS injury consideration. Minor neck injuries very often involve long term pain, requiring rehabilitation. In terms of social cost, the neck is being considered as a top priority in terms of safety. In a paper presented at the 14th ESV Conference, Koch (29) shows that the amount of neck impairment is increasing now days. The neck segment represents 47% of all injuries recorded in 1990-1992 that received a medical impairment of 10% or more. According to this increasing social cost, powerful analysis tool as finite element modelling appears to be necessary. Numerous studies have been made of this body segment, dealing with the kinematics aspect, injury mechanisms and simulation. In this study, in order to concentrate on the central question, we shall confine ourselves to investigations performed in the field of simulation. A bibliographic study is supplied in appendix 1. The various models relating to this analysis can be classified in three main groups: Type One models: These consist of rigid bodies linked together by pivots or spherical joints, depending on whether the model is in 2D or 3D. The positions of the joints were obtained from studies dealing with the head kinematics relative to vertebra Tl. This head movement has often been likened to an arc of a circle for frontal and lateral impacts ((2), (3), (4), (5), (6)). 1645</page><page sequence="2">Type Two models: These models seem closer to the neck's composition. Each deformable element, such as muscles, discs and ligaments, is simulated by elements of the damping-spring, shell or brick type. The characteristics of these elements are derived from experiments ((7), (8), (9) and (26)). Type Three models: The feature of these models is that they provide an overall simulation of the interface between two adjacent vertebrae by damping and stiffness matrices, obtained from tests performed on anatomical parts (10) and (11). These three types of simulation provide generally good results according to the selection criteria adopted by the authors and the field of application (improvement of dummy neck, injury approach). It is worthy of note, that the NBDL data (Ewing, (12) and (13)) were often used as a basis for model response validation. The objective of the present study is to develop a tool for estimating neck protection in automotive type crash tests. Three key elements were identified at the outset of this investigation : -Good simulation of head kinematics relative to the base of the neck (Tl) in 3D. -Provision of information on the stresses sustained by the cervical spine so as to obtain a prediction of possible injuries. -This model is to be installed on a model of the occupant in a car. It is necessary therefore that its number of elements has to be low. In this paper, we shall discuss first the contents and a description of the reference data used as a basis for this study. We shall then describe the geometry and the elements of the model. 1 723 Drivers | АЛЛ H 1 2 3 4 &gt;5 SAI$3 Ranking % AÏS 3+ Ranking Head " 273 UT 9 ~ 2 2198 2nd Ļ9 3rd ( Cranium * Brain 83 142 5 3 2 1796 Ļ4 (Face 300 34 7 761 ifi Neck 118 5 2 1 - 276 7th OA 7th Chest 234 55 27 10 1 2168 3rd 5,3 2nd Upper limbs 140 71 24 - 1356 4th 3^3 4th Spine withont neck 43 11 1 158 8th 0Д 8 th Abdomen 58 4 9 4 589 5th Ļ8 5th Pelvis ^ 55 15 7 - - 364 6th 1 6 th Lower limbs 216 92 54 - 2410 1st 715 1st ( Upper segment {I) 200 47 44 1764 6Д (Lower segment (2) 101 72 19 - - 1190 2,6 Г 354 Right Front Passengers | АЛ.&amp; 1 2 3 4 &gt;5 SAIS3 Ranking %AI$3* Ranking Head ~ 75 ~53~ 6 661 3rd 1/7 5th ( Cranium * Brain 43 52 2 513 0¿6 (Face 70 1 1 4 266 U Neck 66 11 4 - - 262 6th 1Д 6th Chest 154 38 18 9 - 1520 1st 1J&gt; 1st Upper limba 62 40 14 - 760 5th 4Д) 4th Spine without neck 33 11 1 148 8th OA Sth Abdomen 34 4 13 5 1 862 2nd 5,4 2nd Pelvis 30 3 4 162 7th u 6th Lower limbs 102 26 11 - 607 4th ЗД 3rd ( Upper segment (1) 54 5 10 - 394 2/8 ( Lower segment (2) 56 26 5 399 M (1) Including pelvis, femurs and patellas Source: LAB APR Data base (2) Including tibias, ankles and feet Table 1: Injury severity distribution per body segment in frontal impact - Belted occupants 1646</page><page sequence="3">The major part of this paper is devoted to the evaluation of the model relative to the reference data from the NBDL database. Material and Methods Since the early sixties, the NBDL has performed tests involving volunteers, focusing chiefly on the response of the head/neck system to frontal and lateral loading. These tests, due to the fact that they involve live subjects and by the nature of the measurements performed, are essential for modelling of the human neck. In conjunction with the NBDL scientists, a database containing data resulting from 79 tests was set up. In what follows, details are given concerning the conditions of the selected tests and the parameters considered. Preparation The conditions of these tests are briefly repeated here. Detailed description of test set-up can be found in references (12) and (13). The instrumentation includes two accelerometric mounts fastened to the head and the postero-superior thoracic region of each subject. These devices allow measurement of the linear and angular accelerations of the head and of the first thoracic vertebra (Tl). Photographic targets fastened to these mounts make it possible to determine their rotations and movements during the test. The subject is attached, in an upright position, to a seat by a harness, this restraint system being supplemented by a seat belt in inverted V shape and a lap belt. The seat is then set in movement by an accelerator of the HYGE type for the two configurations of frontal and lateral impact (see Figure 1). For lateral impact, a wooden plate is added against the left shoulder to limit the translation along the Y axis for the upper part of the thorax and hence Tl. Cinematographic coverage of the test is provided by three cameras, thus making it possible, in particular, to determine the 3D kinematics of the head and of Tl. Figure 2 illustrates the sled acceleration time histories for the two impact configurations in question. Figure 1: Test set-up configurations used in NBDL experiments for frontal (a : -Gx designation) and lateral (b : -Gy designation) loading directions Figure 2: Sled acceleration time-histories as used by NBDL in volunteer experiments Selection of tests Three criteria were used to select the reference tests for this study from the tests retrieved from the NBDL: a) Test violence (maximum sled acceleration of 15 G in frontal impact, 7 G in lateral impact). b) Availability of all the test results c) Anthropometric criterion: This meant selecting only those subjects having weight and size characteristics similar to those of a 50th percentile standard male, representative of the French average (lm 73, 73 kg - Rebiffé (14)). The choice of the french average instead of international one was motivated only by the availability of detailed anthropometric data needed for this study. 1647</page><page sequence="4">On the basis of these criteria, we selected three subjects, referenced H132, H135 and H139 in Table 2.

These measurements break down as follows: - Model inputs: Linear accelerations of the anatomical centre of T1 along the X, Y and Z axes within a reference linked to the laboratory. - Model validation: - Linear accelerations of the A.C. (anatomical centre) of the head with respect to the laboratory coordinate system (see Figure 3); -Angular accelerations around the X, Y and Z axes of the head with respect to its anatomical coordinate system; - Head rotations (Bryant angles in the order X, Y, Z) relative to the laboratory coordinate system; - Displacements of the A.C. of the head relative to a reference originating at the A.C. of T1 and parallel to the laboratory coordinate system. The linear accelerations as measured on the volunteer were input into the model of the thorax element on Tl. The angular accelerations were not used as input data for the simulation because of a problem of feasibility due to the tools used (RADIOSS (15)). Reference curves for the models To obtain a uniform reference for comparison of the model, envelope curves were established for the three directions of impact and for each of the measurements mentioned above. The reference curves are illustrated in Figures 11 and 12, which are represented in dashed line. One observes that the upper and lower envelopes are very similar for linear and angular accelerations of the head. On the other hand, greater differences are observed for linear and angular displacements. As observed in a previous study (17), the initial position of the head of the subject relative to Tl has a significant influence on the kinematics of this segment. Modelling of the cerv ical spine Once the reference base had been created, the study then continued with the creation of a finite element model of the cervical spine. It seemed to us essential to allow for the action of the articular apophysis in particular during lateral impact, because they set up around the Z axis a rotation of each vertebra, which influences head movement. The finite element package RADIOSS was selected for this new approach, knowing that it is already used by car makers in structural calculations. The vertebrae and the head were considered as rigid bodies, their deformation being insignificant compared with deformation of the soft neck tissues. This model consists of 150 solid elements, 104 1648</page><page sequence="5">shell elements, 412 damping-spring elements and 2 spherical joints. Description of the model The initial positions and the dimensions of the vertebrae (T1 to CI), the discs and the spiny apophysis were determined from sagittal and frontal planes of a 50th percentile subject seated in the driving position. These planes were established by Robbins (18). X-rays taken on cadavers, with a position of the subjects similar to that provided by Robbins, were also used to perform this work. The positions and orientations of the articular apophysis of the vertebrae (C7 to C2) are based on the measurements performed by Maurel (19) on cervical spine specimens. The number of the model elements had to be limited, and only the geometry of the main mechanical elements of the vertebrae was strictly complied with (vertebral bodies, spiny apophysis and articular apophysis). Accordingly, each vertebra in the range between T1 and C3 consists of 12 solid elements (8 nodes) which are distributed as follows (Figure 4) : 4 for the vertebral body, 2 for the spiny apophysis, 1 for each of the two articular apophysis, 2 for the posterior arch and 2 for the two anterior pedicles. In addition, four shell elements are attached to the upper and lower surfaces of each articular apophysis in order to simulate the elliptical shapes of the articular surfaces. As regards the atlas and axis, they are represented by 4 and 12 solid elements respectively. Since the links Figure 3: Head and T1 anatomical systems. Reproduced from (6). H, T1 - Head and T1 anatomical origins, OC - Occipital condilar point. between these two vertebrae and between the atlas and the head are simulated by spherical articulations, we did not consider it necessary, for the time being, to reproduce the exact geometry of the odontoid and the first cervical vertebra. Figure 4 : Sagittal and oblique views of a model vertebra (from T1 to C3) Modelling of intervertebral links, from T1 to C2. The linking elements joining two adjacent cervical vertebrae are identical and are simulated as follows (Figures 5 and 6) : . Each intervertebral disc consists of 8 solid elements (Figure 7), arranged in two layers, linking the lower plate of the upper vertebra to the upper plate of the lower vertebra. In addition, 32 crossed spring-damper 1649</page><page sequence="6">elements placed on the circumference of the disc simulate the action and slants of the disc fibres. . The interspinous, supraspinous and flavia ligaments are simulated by 2, 2 and 5 spring-damper elements respectively, linking together the two spiny apophysis and the two posterior arches - The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments are each simulated by 6 spring-dampers joining the anterior and posterior areas of the two vertebrae respectively. - Contact interfaces between the shell elements fastened to the articular apophysis can simulate the contact between the articular surfaces (normal force and friction force). Moreover, each articular capsule linking two articular surfaces is reproduced by 7 spring-damper elements attached to the circumferences of the two articular surfaces. The use of damping-spring elements avoids problems of calculation errors caused by excessive deformation of the shell and solid elements due to the Hourglass modes of these elements. Modelling of the links between the atlas, the axis and the head. The links between these three elements are complex, first because they are interconnected by numerous ligaments, and second because of the large number of bone contacts : between the side masses of C2 and lower articular surfaces of CI, between the odontoid apophysis of C2 and the posterior facet of the anterior arch of CI, and contacts between the occipital condyles of the head and the upper articular surfaces of CI. Fine modelling of these links would lead to a large number of elements and in particular to damping problems due to the number of contacts to be managed. As a consequence, we have modelled the interface between CI and C2 and between the head and CI by two simple links reproducing their main movements. The links between CI and C2 are materialized by a spherical joint which enables vertebra CI to realize a torsion movement around the axis of the odontoid and a flexion-extension movement (Figure 8). The interface between the head and CI was also simulated, as recommended by Kapandji (20), by a spherical joint whose centre is located slightly above the middle of the occipital condyles.

An initial model was built by imposing on the elements the ligament and disc mechanical properties supplied by Myklebust (21), Goel (22) and Yogonandan (23) and in the NHTSA-UMTRI reports published in 1985 and 1988 (24, 25). During impact simulations, the model's behaviour proved to be unrealistic, since the elements were subjected to excessive strains. The mechanical properties of the elements were enhanced so that the model would produce behaviour similar to that of the NBDL volunteers in terms of head kinematic. These properties are given in table 4, 5 and 6. Figure 9 shows the stiffness and damping of the Head-Cl joint. Table 7 shows a comparaison between the stiffness of the ligaments of Kleinberber's (26) finite element model, which were taken from the literature, and those of this study. They are significant differences between the two models which can be explained by the strategy choosen in this study to obtain a realistic head motion in frontal and lateral impacts. At this stage of development the model lacks realism as it does not simulate separately the action of the neck muscles. Even though, according to Bowman (4), the neck muscles contract only about 175 milliseconds after the start of impact, they have a significant passive action. Increasing the stiffness of the posterior and lateral ligaments was made in order to take into account the action of the posterior and lateral muscles during the two types of impact simulated. An elastic material law was imposed on the solid elements simulating the intervertebral discs. The mass and inertia characteristics of the head are taken from studies performed by Bosio and Bowman (5), and Mac Conville (16) : M=4,615 Kg, Ixx=0,0159 Kg.m2, Iyy=0,024 Kg.m2, Izz=0,0221 Kg.m2 Table 4 : Characteristics of model solid elements Young's Modulus Poisson's Ratio Density (N/mm2) * ** (g/mm^) ** Solid Disc 200 0^29 0,0011 Vetebrae - - 0,00173 * Derived from the present study ** From reference 24 and 25 Table 5 : Stiffness of each spring of the model Tensile stiffness (N/m) Synovial joint 50 Discal fibres 75 Lateral discal 50 fibres Anterior longitudinal 50 ligament Posterior longitudinal 50 ligament Flavia ligament 50 Interspinous ligament 50 Supraspinous ligament 50 The damping of the springs is 2000N.s/m Table 6 : Characteristics of C1/C2 spherical joint Stiffness Damping (N.m/Rad) N.m.s/Rad Around Xaxis 20 2,58 Around Y axis 400 2,58 Around Z axis 2860 2^8 The reference skew system of this spherical joint is defined in figure 8 Figure 9 : Stiffness of Head-Cl model joint 1651</page><page sequence="8">Table 7 : Comparison of mechanical properties of ligaments of this model and those published by Kleinberger (26) Total Stiffness Tensile (N/mm) Model Kleinberger Synovial joint 350 25,3 Anterior longitudinal 75 33 ligament Posterior longitudinal 75 20,4 ligament Flavia ligament 250 27,2 Supraspinous ligament 100 23,7 Interspinous ligament 100 Results The model was tested in frontal and lateral impacts and compared with envelope curves that were obtained from NBDL tests. The model was loaded by imposing on vertebra T1 the same linear accelerations as those measured on the volunteers. Frontal impact (figure 11 and table 8) The head's movements relative to the thorax take place mainly in the sagittal plane. Figure 11 shows the main accelerations and displacements of the model head. The shape of the curve of head angular acceleration around the Y axis is satisfactory, but its main peak is rather low, at 1431 rad/s2, whereas the peaks for the volunteers are between 1747 and 2921 rad/s2. Head linear acceleration along the X axis is very similar to the envelope curves for the volunteers. With respect to the curve of head linear acceleration along the Z axis, the shape of the curve is satisfactory, except for some unrealistic peaks. This seems to be due to the number of elements (668) in the model and the major deformation of the solid elements. Head rotation around the Y axis and displacement along the X axis are very close to the corridors. The head initial translation is well reproduced. The head of the model does not fall enough, compared with those of the volunteers (Z displacement). In our opinion, this may due to incomplete loading of the model, which does not take into account the rotation of vertebra Tl, which can sometimes reach a bending angle of 20° for the NBDL volunteers. A comparison was made between the maximum intervertebral bending angles obtained during this simulation and those measured in static testing on human beings by Panjabi (27) (in vitro) and Mestdagh (28) (in vivo) (Table 9). The angles obtained with the model from C7 to C3 are larger than those measured by Panjabi and Mestdagh, which seems logical given the violence of the impact simulated. For the links between the head and atlas and between the atlas and axis, the maximum bending values given by the model are very close to those obtained by Panjabi (27) on post mortem human subjects. In addition, the model verifies the relation linking intervertebral displacements in bending. С5ЛС6&gt;С4ЛС5&gt;С6ЛС7&gt;СЗЛС4&gt;С2ЛСЗ (С5ЛС6 : bending angle between C5 and C6) Side impact (figure 12 and table 10) The model reproduces very satisfactorily the shapes of the curves of linear and angular acceleration of the head relative to the main X axis. However, the main peaks of these curves are approximately 30 % higher than the maximum values measured with the volunteers. The linear and angular accelerations obtained by means of the model for the X and Z axes show excessively high peaks, apparently due to a damping problem. However, their shapes are satisfactory. The displacements and main rotation of the head around the X axis are very close to the corridors for the1 volunteers. The head rotations around the Y and Z axes are satisfactory in terms of shape. However, the extreme values are 19 % higher around the X axis and 23 % too low around the Z axis. The results obtained with this sophisticated approach to the neck on the whole correspond well to the volunteer responses for both frontal and lateral directions, particularly for linear and angular displacements of the head. The model reproduces well the initial phase of head translation, relative to the thorax, that can be observed on human beings during frontal and side impacts. In addition, the peaks of the model responses occur nearly at the same time as those of volunteers. However, damping problems appear on most of the linear and angular acceleration curves due to the large numbers of elements and the elastic properties of the solid elements simulating the discs. The rebounding phase of the head given by the model is faster than that observed on the volunteers for both types of impacts. This is related to the fact that the model does not simulate the muscular contraction which becomes dominant after approximately 175 milliseconds. A representation of the finite element model behaviour in frontal and lateral loading is illustrated in figure 13, where details on vertebra motion are provided. 1652</page><page sequence="9">Figure 1 1 : Finite element model responses (solid line) compared to volunteer corridor (dashed lines) in frontal impact Table 8 : Frontal impact, comparison of extremal values, Model/Volunteers Maximum values of volunteer corridors Minimum values of volunteer corridors Model values Head Angular Aec. around Y axis 2922 Rad/s2 (95.5 m s) 1748 Rad/s2 (96.5 ms) 1369 Rad/s2 (103.ms) Head Linear A ce. along X axis -26.2 G (95. ms) -38.2 G (99. ms) -37.

It was found that such studies are not numerous and that most of the properties have been determined by static or quasi-static testing. 2-A finite element model of the cervical spine was developed and its kinematic responses to a selected set of volunteer data analyzed. This model, based on the FEM technique, takes into consideration the reality of the neck structure by modelling each vertebral body with its articular and spiny apophysis. Intervertebral discs and ligaments are represented by brick and spring elements. 3-For the various loading directions considered, the model responses were evaluated by comparing with the reference time-histories and considering head 3-D accelerations and displacements. The analysis was not limited to the loading phase but extended up to 300 ms in order to account for rebounding phase of the head. 4-The finite element model was evaluated in frontal and lateral loading directions. The preliminary results obtained in terms of head accelerometric responses are promising, however some head kinematical data are not close to the reference, i.e. the head z-displacement in frontal impact. Apart from this, an investigation was made in order to estimate roughly displacements of the model vertebrae in frontal flexion. For this purpose, the maximum intervertebral bending angles obtained by the model during simulation of frontal impact were compared with measurements taken in static testing on subjects in a position of hyperflexion. The results obtained are encouraging. 5-An initial model was worked out by imposing on the elements the stiffness values and Young's modulus values (discs) available in the literature. But this model proved to undergo excessive strain during simulation of impact. Consequently, the elements of the model were stiffened to obtain satisfactory head kinematics compared with the NBDL data in frontal and side impact, while keeping consistent vertebral displacements. The model, due to its complexity, has the same damping problems as those encountered by Reber and Goldsmith (7) and by Merril et Goldsmith (8). Since these problems affect only the values obtained in the secondary directions, they are not excessively penalizing. Future work Future efforts will focus on improving the finite element model through the following areas where inclusion of muscle action will be the target number one : -Loading of the model not only with linear accelerations (as in this study), but also with angular accelerations of vertebra Tl. This loading would make it possible to obtain simultaneously good results for displacements of the A.C. and head rotations, for those configurations which remain to be improved, namely frontal and oblique impacts. -As the model does not predict injuries, a refined version will be developed by considering the muscles insertions and actions during the loading phase in which we are interested, prior to their contraction. We selected 9 pairs of principal neck muscles. Due to the importance of their deformations we envisage their simulation by spring- damper elements. The work performed by Deng and Goldsmith (11) will serve as a reference to define their mechanical characteristics (force/elongation). -As neck injuries occur more often in cases of head impact, further validation of the model will be performed according to tests involving this type of head-neck loading with various impact severities and involving PMHS. -In order to evaluate the model's behaviour for more violent impacts, tests will be carried out at our laboratory with PMHS in frontal and lateral directions. -Tests on PMHS will be performed to evaluate more precisely the intervertebral displacements at impact, including the definition of a testing protocol necessary to study dynamic motions of vertebrae. -The resulting model will be used, finally, to study the injury mechanisms and acceptable stresses of the cervical spine during impacts.
