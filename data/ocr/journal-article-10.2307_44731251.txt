Chou and B. B. Fileta Ford Motor Co. Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, inc. ABSTRACT The University of Virginia is investigating the use of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) angular rate sensor to measure head angular acceleration in impact testing. Output from the sensor, which measures angular velocity, must be differentiated to produce angular acceleration. As a precursor to their use in actual testing, a torsional pendulum was developed to analyze an MHD sensor's effectiveness in operating under impact conditions. Differentiated and digitally filtered sensor data provided a good match with the vibratory response of the pendulum for various magnitudes of angular acceleration. Subsequent head drop tests verified that MHD sensors are suitable for measuring head angular acceleration in impact testing. INTRODUCTION Head Injuries Due To Angular Acceleration Brain injuries occurring in automobile accidents fall generally into two categories: focal brain injuries and diffuse brain injuries. Focal brain injuries occur as a result of head contact, or impact loading. Diffuse brain injuries occur as a result of sudden head motion, or inertial loading. Translation and rotation, independently or in combination, convey inertial loading. Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI), in particular, has been linked to the presence of non-impact rotational acceleration during impact collisions (Gennarelli, 1993). Margulies, et al. (1990) subjected models of the skull-brain tissue structure to rotational accelerations of varying magnitudes. Results indicated that DAI, which manifests itself immediately after injury as a prolonged state of coma, may be experienced when the head encounters rotational accelerations on the order of 20,000 rad/s2. Although brain injuries usually result from a combination of contact loads and inertial loads, they can be produced by a single event such as pure head rotation. As such, measuring angular head acceleration is an important means of identifying injury potential. However, the current standard for measuring head injury potential in automobile collisions is the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), a value based upon the vector sum of translational accelerations in anthropomorphic dummy headparts. Angular accelerations alone have no affect on the HIC value. Determining HIC in Cadaver Tests Aside from its importance in assessing brain injury risk, angular head acceleration can be used in cadaver tests to find the HIC value. This is accomplished by attaching sensors to the outer surface of the cadaver's skull. The sensors measure the skull's angular velocity and acceleration (assuming the skull acts as a rigid body) and the linear acceleration of a point on the skull. This information is required to determine the acceleration of the cadaver head's center-of-gravity, which is then used to find the HIC value. In this manner, it is possible to compare HIC values derived in cadaver tests with those obtained in dummy tests. MEASURING ANGULAR RATE The angular velocity and acceleration of a rigid body can be measured using accelerometers arranged in an array, or with angular rate sensors. Several methods have been reported, such as a 3-2-2-2 accelerometer array described by Padgaonkar et al. (1975), a 3-3-3 accelerometer array described by Nusholtz (1993), and the use of three angular rate sensors described by Laughlin (1989). The 3-2-2-2 Array Padgoankar describes a method of measuring angular acceleration of a rigid body using nine accelerometers positioned in a 3-2-2-2 pattern. This configuration consists of a tri-axial accelerometer group at the body origin, and three pairs of accelerometers positioned at some distance on the three mutually orthogonal body axes. The appeal of this scheme lies in the parallelism of the three matched pairs of accelerometers which allows cancellation of the Coriolis components of angular acceleration. This leaves only the differences between the various pairs of accelerometer signals and their separations along the axes as the direct determinators of the angular acceleration components at each point in time. The 3-3-3 Array Nusholtz describes a measurement system of nine accelerometers arranged in a 3-3-3 array. This scheme applies spherical geometric analysis which exploits the topology of the sphere in its approach. Three tri-axial accelerometer groups are positioned in a circular pattern in manner that allows both angular acceleration and angular velocity to be obtained by manipulating the output from the linear accelerometers. 985</page><page sequence="2">Nine accelerometer array schemes can be used to measure HIC and angular head acceleration. DiMasi (1995) illustrates how Padgoankar's 3-2-2-2 accelerometer array can be mounted within a Hybrid III head, and Nusholtz et al. (1985) has demonstrated how a 3-3-3 accelerometer array can be mounted to a cadaver head. MHD Angular Rate Sensors The recent development of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) angular rate sensor has generated new possibilities for measuring angular acceleration. MHD sensors, which measure angular velocity, have four components: the permanent magnet, the electrode areas, the conductive fluid, and the case. The conductive fluid lies in a constrained annular region within the field of the permanent magnet, which is attached to the case. The sensitive axis of the unit runs through the center of the annular region, perpendicular to the plane of the annulus. As the instrument rotates about the sensitive axis, the case, permanent magnet, and magnetic field rotate producing a magnetic field, B. The conductive fluid, however remains stationary with respect to its own reference frame producing a relative motion, U, between a magnetic field and a conductor. This motion produces a voltage, E , governed by the relationship: E=UxB [1] Laughlin demonstrated that MHD sensor output (angular velocity) may be numerically differentiated to obtain accurate angular acceleration data. In his tests, data was collected from impacts of a Hybrid III dummy head fitted with both an MHD angular rate sensor and a 3-2-2-2 accelerometer array. Angu- lar acceleration obtained by differentiating MHD sensor out- put was a close match to that obtained from the 3-2-2-2 array. The MHD sensors used in Laughlin' s tests were developed by Applied Technology Associates, Inc. (ATA) of Albuquerque, NM and are marketed as model number ARS- 01 . ATA has since developed an orthogonal set of three MHD sensors housed in a single 3.18 cm x 3.18 cm x 4.06 cm aluminum cube. This cube, referred to as the Dynacube, weighs 86 grams and furnishes separate measurements of angular velocity about three orthogonal axes. Furthermore, accelerometers can be mounted on the aluminum case to provide a 6-degree-of-freedom system. However, the Dynacube has only about half the dynamic range and half the resolution of the ARS-01. Using Dynacubes to find angular acceleration At the University of Virginia (UVa), an effort is being made to incorporate head response measurements using Dynacubes into dummy and cadaver impact tests. UVa already uses Dynacubes to measure foot and ankle rotation of dummies and cadavers in dynamic sled tests (Hall et al., 1996). Dynacubes have also been used by Klopp et al. (1995) at UVa to record whole-body rotation in tests involving the Side Impact Dummy (SID). Rather than using a nine accelerometer array, UVa is considering extending the use of the Dynacube to determine angular head acceleration. A Dynacube is easy to mount and handle, it is light-weight and compact, and it does not greatly influence the movement of the body part upon which it is attached. Moreover, the HIC value and angular head acceleration can be evaluated using three accelerometers mounted to one Dynacube for a total of just six data channels. VALIDATION OF MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY Notwithstanding Laughlin' s reported success using the ATA model ARS-01 MHD sensor to determine angular acceleration in an impact environment, the effectiveness of the Dynacube, given its lower resolution and lower dynamic range, is not as certain. Therefore, UVa has developed a test fixture that generates predictable angular velocities and accelerations of similar magnitude to those seen in head impact tests against which sensor output may be compared. The test fixture consists of a torsional pendulum that is capable of handling various angular rate measuring instruments, including a Dynacube. Figure 1. Torsional pendulum. Torsional Pendulum The torsional pendulum is a single-degree-of-freedom system constrained to rotate about its axis. When the pendulum disk is rotated and released suddenly, it undergoes free vibration that follows a simple damped harmonic motion. The device is used to compare the output of a three-axis Dynacube (or other rate sensors) with the theoretical response of the harmonic system. The pendulum also serves as a means to check sensor outputs for any signal irregularities. Description of the pendulum The pendulum is a very simple mechanical structure consisting of the following components: 986</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Top View of Pendulum. Frame - Constructed of steel channels, the rigid frame houses the pendulum spring. Radial bearings built into the frame constrain motion of the spring to rotation about its axis only. The size and weight of the frame assure that it will not vibrate significantly as energy is released by the oscillating pendulum. Spring Rod - A 3-meter long steel rod provides the system with enough stiffness to produce angular accelerations up to 20,000 rad/sec2. Rods of various diameters may be interchanged to produce different frequencies. Collar - The collar, or pendulum disk, is bolted directly to the top end of the spring rod. Markings on the collar allow the amplitudes of the pendulum to be easily tracked by a high speed video camera positioned above the apparatus. The collar also provides a surface onto which the Dynacube (or other instrumentation) may be mounted. Potentiometer - The collar is connected by gears to a rotary potentiometer. Potentiometer measures the position of the collar and serves as a check against the theoretical predictions and Dynacube data. Mounting block - The block enables the Dynacube to be mounted so that all three of its axes form an equal angle with the pendulum's axis of rotation. When mounted as such, each Dynacube axis should produce the same response. Thus, the pendulum serves as a means to check the Dynacube's sensitivity factors, and enables them to be adjusted if needed. Latch pin - Upon setting the collar at an initial angle of twist, the collar is released suddenly by disengaging the latch pin. This sends the pendulum immediately into a state of free vibration. Theoretical response The movement of the pendulum is assumed to obey simple harmonic motion subjected to viscous damping. The equation for the angular position as a function of time for the free vibration of such a system is: 0(t) = Exp(-Ç to n t) • |e0 Cos[to d t] + ((Çe„(Dn+0o)/(ôd) Sin[cod t] } [2] where: G)n = Natural frequency of the pendulum cod = Damped natural frequency 0O = Initial angular position (angle of twist) 0O = Initial angular velocity Ç = Damping factor The damped natural frequency is related to the undamped natural frequency by: ®d=T¡í-(í ® n t3l and the initial position, 0O , is set by adjusting the position of the latch pin. The initial velocity, 0O, is zero since the pendulum is released from rest. Moreover, it is possible to calculate the natural frequency of the pendulum from the spring constant, mass, and moment of inertial of its components. These values can be obtained either experimentally or from published material property lists. Unfortunately, damping arises in a manner that does not allow the damping factor to be determined directly. Damping in the pendulum results from looseness of joints, internal damping in the spring rod, friction within the bearings, and does not result from some viscous dashpot. It is not possible to treat all of these forms of damping. However, since the amplitude of the vibration follows an approximately exponential decay, viscous damping is used in the mathematical model of the system. The angular velocity and angular acceleration is determined by taking the time derivative of the position: angular velocity - 0(t) = - 0(t) [4] dt d2 angular acceleration - 0(t) = - - 0(t) [5] dt2 Pendulum Operation Operation of the pendulum is simple. A Dynacube is affixed to the mounting block and the block is attached to the pendulum collar. The collar is rotated to a given angle and held in place by the latch pin. The collar may be rotated to any angle up to 45°, and variations in the angle of rotation may be used to control the amplitude. The latch pin is then quickly disengaged, sending the pendulum into a state of free vibration. As the pendulum oscillates, the rotary potentio- meter tracks its position. Meantime, a high-speed camera (Kodak Ektapro model 1012) operating at 10000 frames per second captures the event on video tape. 987</page><page sequence="4">Data Analysis Data analysis is performed on three levels: displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Displacement analysis is performed first, with the validity of the potentiometer data verified against the high-speed video data. Since the pendulum displacement is measured directly by two independent sources, it is on this level that the parameter constants for the equation of motion of the pendulum are determined. Parameter constants are initially estimated from the material properties of the pendulum, and then adjusted so that the theoretical response fits the potentiometer/camera data. These same constants are subsequently used in analyses at the velocity and acceleration levels. At the velocity level, Dynacube data is compared with potentiometer data and the theoretical response. First, the potentiometer data is differentiated using a 3-point differentiation scheme, and then digitally filtered using a 2- pass second order Butterworth algorithm evaluated at 200 Hz. Then, the Dynacube data is analyzed for consistency. All three Dynacube channels should have identical output. If they do not, it indicates one or more calibration factors need to be adjusted. In this fashion, the pendulum serves as a means to check angular rate sensors for any signal irregularities and determine correction factors. After the calibration factors are adjusted, all three Dynacube outputs should be nearly identical to each other and to the differentiated potentiometer data scaled by ^3 . Finally, the corrected Dynacube data must be transformed from the local Dynacube reference frame to the collar reference frame using the following transformation: Xqx Cos(a) Sin(a) Sin(ß) Sin(a)Cos(ß) Yea. =[Xmhd Ymhd Zmhd]. 0 -Cas(p) Sin(ß) [6] ZcolJ [-Sin(a) Cos(a) Sin(ß) Cos(a) Co8(ß)J where a and ß define the orientation of the Dynacube with respect to the collar. The rotation angles formed by attaching the Dynacube to the mounting block are: a = rotation about the y-axis = 45° ß = rotation about the x-axis = 35.26° When using the mounting block, XCOllar and YC0Llar should approach zero after the transformation is complete. At the acceleration level Dynacube data is again compared with the theoretical response and potentiometer data. The potentiometer output is differentiated and filtered a second time. The three corrected Dynacube outputs are first differentiated using a 3-point differentiation scheme, then digitally filtered using a 2-pass second order Butterworth algorithm, and finally transformed to the collar reference frame. RESULTS Results for a typical test are shown in Figures 3-6. Figure 3 shows the pendulum displacement time-history. The potentiometer data and the fitted theoretical data are close, but not a perfect match due mainly to the fact that the damping is not purely viscous. jg .

Changing the position of the Dynacube on the mount and re- running the test at different speeds and frequencies verified that the inconsistent output was caused by inaccurate Dynacube sensitivity factors, and not a consequence of out-of- plane movement in the pendulum due to looseness in bearings and joints. The output was adjusted so that all three outputs most closely matched each other and the potentiometer data. Figure 5 shows the pendulum velocity time-histories obtained from three sources: Dynacube data corrected and transformed to the collar reference frame; potentiometer data differentiated and filtered at 200 Hz; and the theoretical response. There is almost a complete overlap of Dynacube and potentiometer data indicating that the Dynacube works very well in measuring angular velocity. Figure 6 shows the pendulum acceleration time-history of the three sources: Dynacube data corrected; differentiated, filtered at 600 Hz, and transformed to the collar reference frame; potentiometer data differentiated twice and filtered at 100 Hz; and the theoretical response. The theoretical response has been shifted manually to the right to be in phase with the Dynacube and potentiometer data. The out-of-phase condition occurs during the brief moment when the latch pin disengages from the collar. The data match is not as precise as that seen on the velocity level, but it is still very close, particulary between the Dynacube and the theoretical response at the initial peak. The initial acceleration peak is oftentimes the highest in actual head impacts. This peak has been lost in the potentiometer data due to the heavy filtering. Other tests were performed using the same Dynacube at higher and lower pendulum frequencies and amplitudes. In all cases, Dynacube data differentiated and filtered at 600 Hz produced a good correlation with the theoretical angular acceleration, like that seen in Figure 6. Dynacube Application A dummy head drop test was conducted to determine if the pendulum response is representative of an actual impact. The behavior of a Dynacube in an actual head impact was also examined. The test was configured so that angular motion was constrained to the head's y-axis. A Dynacube was placed inside the dummy head, and three linear accelerometers were affixed to the Dynacube to produce a 6-degree-of-freedom measurement system. In Figure 7, the unfiltered vs. filtered (600 Hz) Dynacube output is shown. The frequency and amplitude are similar to those that can be produced by the pendulum, confirming that the pendulum can provide an impulse comparable to an actual head impact. As in the pendulum tests, the 600 Hz filter is seen to remove only the very high-frequency components. The actual angular acceleration of the head is unknown, but an analogy with the pendulum test would indicate that it is very close to the filtered Dynacube data. As a final note, this head impact was considered moderate by the current head injury standard: the calculated HIC value was 570. CONCLUSIONS The measurement of angular acceleration in head impact studies has gained recognition as an important indicator of head injury potential. Although there are several methods of measuring angular acceleration in a rigid body, no standard measurement protocol has yet been recognized by all testing agencies. Differentiated output from a Dynacube, an angular rate sensor marketed by ATA, Inc., simplifies the measurement of angular head acceleration in impact tests because it is compact, easy to handle, and requires only three data channels. However, limited information was available on the reliability of differentiated Dynacube output. UVa therefore constructed a torsional pendulum to study Dynacube output and to develop a measurement protocol to determine angular acceleration. Two important findings came out of this study: 1. Dynacube output filtered at 600 Hz provides a good measure of angular acceleration for head impacts in automobile crashes. 2. Although the three orthogonal Dynacube outputs are not always consistent with one another, the pendulum can be used to determine appropriate correction factors. Future analyses of head, limb, and torso kinematics in crash tests may be expanded by using angular acceleration measurements determined with Dynacubes. 10,000 n 5,000 - X Ę 0 -uf ¡m* ' i - f 1 - nj I 0. )0 Vol / 0.02 -5,000 - "10'00° Time, Sec Figure 7.
