<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gracious Accommodations: Herbert's "Love III" Anne Williams "Love III" is among Herbert's highest achievements. Like all his best lyrics, it is quiet, lucid, conventional, and yet deeply personal, an expression of doctrines not merely known, but lived and felt. The more intimately one becomes acquainted with the poem, however, the more puzzling it becomes; and as the climax of The Temple, a vision of the soul's entrance into heaven, it is remarkably untriumphant, unapocalyptic, unvisionary. Recognition of this paradox appears frequently in critical discussions of "Love III." It seems easier, in fact, to point out what is not in the poem than what is. Thus, Helen Vendler comments on the lyric's refusal to conform to any one genre: "As we read the poem ... we slide, so to speak, from genre to genre, from love poem to allegory to homily to debat."2 Arnold Stein remarks on another kind of ineffability: "This particular fictive scene and debate are revealed as a ritual that re-enacts a religious mystery of timeless recurrence. When the union is consum- mated, so is the poem-not finished... but in effect consumed .... Our otherwise useful terms--equilibrium, closed form-seem utterly inadequate."3 Stanley Fish, though acknowledging a stronger sense of an ending, nevertheless finds its quick achievement somewhat troubling: the soul "has been killed with kindness .... It is a closure," he writes, "which rather than being earned, is imposed."4 Inescapably we must read Herbert through the lens of a twentieth-century sensibility, which is-in some respects at least-to read him "through a glass, darkly," but "Love III" yields its complexities (and dramatic simplicities) most clearly in the context of Herbert's theology. One purpose of this essay is to examine that context, to see what it can reveal about the poem. A new reading of the lyric is not my only intention, however. For although I believe that the theological perspective draws attention to what is in the poem rather than what is not, it also reveals, as other perspectives have not, Herbert's artistic technique. It discloses the peculiar nature of an extremely compact symbolic narrative that, although unusual, is both consistent and satisfyingly complete. I The ways in which Herbert's is not only a religious but also a specifically Protestant poetry have interested recent critics. Barbara K. Lewalski, with pro- digious documentation, places Herbert in the context of "Protestant poetics."' Chana Bloch examines the verbal indebtedness of "Love III" to the Bible. Her thesis about this relationship of source and poetic text, however, leads her to deny the familiar assumption that "Love III" concerns the entrance of the soul into I/Joseph Summers was first among modern critics to emphasize the important fact of the poem's place in The Temple (George Herbert: His Religion and Art [Cambridge, Mass., 1954], p. 89). Though this thesis has recently been denied, I shall argue that it is valid. 2/ Helen Vendler, The Poetry of George Herbert (Cambridge, Mass., 1975), p. 60. 3/Arnold Stein, George Herbert s Lyrics (Baltimore, 1968), p. 195. 4/Stanley Fish, The Living Temple (Berkeley, Calif., 1978), pp. 155-56. 5/Barbara K.

I would answer that the complex heritage of Herbert's theology does, in fact, offer a strategy for this task. The Bible and the whole of Christian experience are Herbert's sources, but as I shall try to show in some detail, the self-imposed limits of his succinct mode of lyric required that he reshape, and in a sense rewrite, that inherited tradition. The primary theological concept essential to a reading of "Love III" (as no one to my knowledge has remarked) is the notion of "accommodation." This term, familiar in Reformation Protestant doctrine, denotes the variety of ways in which God has manifested himself to man since the Fall. The first meanings of "accom- modation" (in its nontheological sense) listed in the OED are also relevant to the theological concept: accommodation is "the action of fitting, adapting, or suiting." This Christian doctrine provides an explanation of the paradox that God, who is an ineffable spirit and "dwelleth in unapproachable light," can reveal himself to his creature, man, whose faculties of perception have been "mutilated and disease- ridden" by original sin.7 Man's perspective on earth, as Saint Paul wrote, is at best one of relative blindness: "Now we see through a glass, darkly; then we shall see face to face" (1 Cor. 13:12). The human mind could no more comprehend the grace of God than a thimble can contain the ocean-and yet God has, through history, made himself progressively better understood by man, as human capacities have been rendered ever readier to receive him. In the Institutes of the Christian Religion Calvin uses the term seven times, each one explaining a different aspect of divine revelation, a different "glass" or "mirror" or "reflection" or "Shadowy symbol." The first and most universal of these modes is the book of the creatures, nature itself, which is "general to all men" and reveals, even to the relatively undiscerning (because unsanctified) eye, the attributes of God. The created world is, according to Calvin, "a sort of mirror in which we can contemplate God, who is otherwise invisible."' This means of accommodation is the one least relevant to "Love III" since the soul has already turned away from the world of nature. Yet since the fundamental premise of the doctrine of accom- modation is the necessity of symbolism derived from earthly experience, the book of the creatures (evoked by one word, "dust") remains a shadowy presence in the poem, in that it furnishes the medium in which the soul conceives its experience on entry into heaven. This need for symbolic mediation has several important consequences for our conception of divinity. First, it absolves God from any accusations of change- ableness or infidelity and of any negative human emotions such as anger. Calvin 6/Chana Bloch, "George Herbert and the Bible: A Reading of 'Love (III),'" English Literary Renaissance 8 (1978): 332. 7/John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles, Library of Christian Classics, vols. 20 and 21 (Philadelphia, 1960), p. 190. In quoting Calvin as a definitive source, I follow Lewalski's argument that "it is hardly necessary now to argue that the theological tenor of the English Church in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries was firmly Protestant, even Calvinist" (p. 13). 8/Calvin, 20:52.</page><page sequence="3">Williams/Herbert's "Love III" 15 devotes an entire section to this issue, arguing that "Scripture speaks of God's 'repentance' to make allowances for our understanding": "Because our weakness does not attain to his exalted state, the description of him that is given must be accommodated to our capacity so that we may understand it. Now the mode of accommodation is for him to represent himself to us not as he is in himself, but as he seems to us."9 Second, the doctrine of accommodation also stipulates a progressive revelation of divinity to man throughout history, a development analogous to that from childhood to maturity. This process, according to Calvin, accounts for the higher revelation of divinity in the New Testament: "Since [the Old Testament Jews] had not yet come to know Christ intimately, they were like children whose weakness could not yet bear the full knowledge of heavenly things."'o God is like the householder, who "instructs, rules, and guides his children one way in infancy, another way in youth, and still another in young manhood.""' But the primary example of divine accommodation is the incarnation of Christ, the divine appearing in human form (a living reminder that "God is Love"). Moreover, Christ during his ministry characteristically taught in parables, them- selves a literary mode perfectly embodying the larger principle of accommodation- the revelation of divine mysteries by means of the humble and familiar. Christ's most significant act, however, was the Atonement, a term that recalls other nontechnical meanings of accommodation: "to reconcile," or "to arrange the settlement of a dispute." "Atonement" is derived from the Middle English at-onen-- to make as one. This process is, according to Calvin, precisely the purpose of the Incarnation: not to make God love those whom he had formerly despised because of their sinful disobedience but to reveal to men how God loves them. Hence, for the Christian still on earth the recurrent symbol of this greatest of accommodations is the sacrament of communion. As Calvin writes, "Here our merciful Lord, according to his infinite kindness, so tempers himself to our capacity that since we are creatures who always creep on the ground, cleave to the flesh, and do not think about or even conceive of anything spiritual, he condescends to lead us to himself even by these earthly elements, and to set before us in the flesh a mirror of spiritual blessings." Communion is the ritual reminder of this "spiritual banquet," to signify that "God has received us, once for all, unto his family, to hold us not only as servants, but as sons." And Calvin continues: "Now Christ is the only food of our soul, and therefore our Heavenly Father invites us to Christ, that, refreshed by partak- ing of him, we may repeatedly gather strength until we have reached heavenly immortality."12 One of Herbert's contemporaries, Edward Reynolds, writes in his Meditations on the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Last Supper, published in 1638 but (according to the author) "written many years since": "So humble is his mercy that since we cannot raise our understanding to the comprehension of divine mysteries, he will bring downe, and submit those mysteries to the apprehension of our senses." He 9/Ibid., p. 227. 10/Ibid., p. 350. 11/ Ibid., p. 462. 12/ Ibid., 21:1359-61.</page><page sequence="4">16 Modern Philology (August 1984) goes on: "Hereafter our bodies shall be over-clothed with a spirituall glory by a reall union unto Christ in his kingdom;... Then shall sense be exalted and made fit subject of glory, here is glory humbled and made a fit object of sense:... in the glasse of the creatures, in the glasse of the word, in the glasse of the Sacraments." 13 Herbert's desire to portray the soul's meeting with God created both artistic and theological difficulties: How could the earthly poet describe the heavenly feast? How could the artist who "cannot look on thee" envision that experience? Herbert could only turn to the one resource available-the divine accommodations of God to man, which for this theme establish at once the farthest reach of and the limits permissible to his imagination. Accommodating himself to those limits, accommo- dating his inherited symbols to his needs, he created a poem that embodies the term "accommodation" itself in seemingly innumerable ways. II Though "Love III" is Herbert's vision of that moment when we "shall be over- clothed with a spirituall glory by a reall union unto Christ in his kingdom" (a universal experience of the elect), he dramatizes, in a characteristically original strategy, not the moment of epiphany, but the moment before, the process through which the need for accommodation is gradually discarded. Saint Paul declares that the change takes place "in the twinkling of an eye" (1 Cor. 15:52), but the earthbound poet translates that instant into human time, an accommodation that creates a strong narrative element in the lyric. As many readers have noticed, the poem evokes several of Christ's parables without extensive specific allusions to any one of them. In fact, "Love III" shows the speaker living a parable unique to him, which is congruent with the Protestant conception of Christian experience: each is different, yet the same; each soul is unique, yet each follows the same path toward heaven. "Love III" is thus reminiscent of a dream in which one finds oneself in a place unknown to waking experience and yet familiar, as if visited before, in other dreams. And the soul, we can suppose, has "been here" before in its previous imaginative experience of biblical narratives. In spite of the clarity and directness of the poem, it is dreamlike in other ways also. It is without linear time (oscillating back and forth between the past and present tenses) and without a setting, except for those shadowy props one can infer from the conversation of the two speakers, Love and the soul, who are themselves remarkable, being universal yet distinctly and even sharply characterized. The concrete situation points to the most familiar sense of "accommodation"-"lodging, food." But the wafer of communion is also called "the host," meaning "sacrificial victim." From the beginning we know that this is no ordinary innkeeper, and no mundane guest: Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back Guiltie of dust and sinne. [My emphasis]'4 13/Edward Reynolds, Meditations on the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Last Supper (London, 1638), pp. 8-9. 14/ F. E. Hutchinson, ed., The Works of George Herbert (Oxford, 1941), pp. 188-89.</page><page sequence="5">Williams/ Herbert's "Love Ill" 17 Vendler believes these first two lines suggest that Herbert is "cavalier with his allegory: no writer who wanted to maintain an illusion of allegory would 'give away' his 'sentence' as Herbert does in 'Guiltie of dust and sinne.""' Perhaps, however, these abstractions do not necessarily give away the meaning but are instead necessary signals of the presence of a different "sentence." The word "sinne" is perhaps more perplexing, but it also points, in Spenser's familiar formulation, to "a continued allegory, or dark conceit." If I am correct in seeing the poem as redolent of the concept of "accommodation," then the tenor of the poem is not merely sin but also divine grace and its accommodations to man. The poem epitomizes the entire history of the sanctified soul, of all sanctified souls. Arriving at the end of its journey, still preoccupied with its earthly existence ("dust") and its Fall ("sinne"), the soul, like an unsure student, requires a ritualistic repetition, a final review of the nature of divine grace before it realizes itself as, in Reynolds's words, "fit subject for glory." The subtlety of Herbert's art not only accommodates itself to the rehearsal of a long and complex history of cosmic events in a very brief lyric; it also accommo- dates all the characters in which God has revealed himself to man throughout this history. Herbert's shifting of the suggested relationships between Love and the soul shows a triune divinity fleetingly apparent as man (the host), as bridegroom, as father; and the soul recapitulates its various complementary roles-weary traveler, bride, child of God. These shifting relationships, which are the lyric's invisible center of gravity, are indicated partly by the changing generic signals that Vendler enumerates, and they might also be taken as yet another kind of accommodation- that of love poetry, homily, debate, and so on, to the purposes of sacred verse. The ironic dimension within the lyric is thus not so much in the quick resolution that Fish notes as in the revelation through the dramatic exchange that a false and misplaced humility is the last infirmity of saintly minds. Even on the threshold of eternal bliss the soul is not capable of grasping the nature of grace. Thus divinity must reveal itself through a sequence of masks that are historically regressive. It first appears as love (st. 1) and moves, in the face of the soul's refusal to sit down at the feast, toward the role of the gentle but implacable father (st. 3). In the first lines, although grace is still mediated, accommodated to the needs of the timid soul, God is scarcely anthropomorphic; though he has hands, quick eyes, and voice, God appears not as Christ (God as man) but as "Love," a closer expression in human terms of his ineffable nature. God as Love also evokes the pervasive biblical trope of Christ the bridegroom, the soul as bride, which accounts for the suggestion of secular love poetry in the early exchanges between the two. We are subtly reminded that this encounter also portrays the bridegroom welcom- ing a shy (if loving) bride to her wedding feast-a bride who dares not lift her veil ("Ah, my deare / I cannot look on thee" [lines 9-10]), a bride who later asks to take a humbler position in the household ("then I will serve" [line 16]). The action of the poem is also a recapitulation of the narrative of human history, of the creation, the Fall, and the Atonement. When the soul calls itself "unkinde, ungrateful" (line 9), Love answers, "Who made the eyes but I?" (line 12). Implicitly admitting this fact of creation, the soul then recalls its Fall, original and 15/Vendler, p. 60.</page><page sequence="6">18 Modern Philology (August 1984) individual: "Truth, Lord, but I have marr'd them" (line 13). And then Love replies, "And know ye not... who bore the blame?" (line 15)-a gentle reminder of the greatest and most generous instance of accommodation. While this rehearsal is being carried on, the language of the debate, while typical of Herbert in its simplicity and understatement, consistently points to the "sentence" or allos manifested in puns on various aspects of accommodation. When the soul calls itself "unkinde, ungratefull," one wonders if this is not a rather restrained synecdoche for the whole of human depravity. But each term is also an epithet quietly declaring alienation from grace. "Unkind" means "unsympathetic, lacking in tenderness and gentleness," but more profoundly suggests "of a different origin, nature, or essential character." In other words, the soul expresses a Mani- chean fear that heaven is not his home, that he is not a true child of God. Similarly, "ungratefull" means "lacking a proper feeling of thankfulness" (and like unkindness, is a notorious failing of fallen man); but "gratitude" is etymologically akin to "grace"-a relation still present in the phrase "to say grace before meals," which is to express proper thanks. When Love replies, by means of his rhetorical question, assuring the soul that he is a child of God, and heaven his home, this kinship and unity are reinforced poetically by a punning identification of the two: "Who made the eyes but I?" (line 12, my emphasis).'6 Remembering the Fall, the soul pleads that his "shame / Go where it doth deserve" (lines 13-14). One meaning of shame is "disgrace," or, in this context, "dis-grace," another declaration of separation, though here not underlined by a pun. Yet even after Love's reminder of the Atonement, the two are not yet "at one" or reconciled, accommodated to each other. The uncomprehending soul makes one final effort to adjust and adapt, volunteering his service at the heavenly feast. (One recalls Calvin's remark about communion, quoted above, which argues that this sacrament shows "that we are not servants but sons.") Hence Love speaks paternally, without invoking the wrathful patriarch of the Old Testament. "You must sit down" (line 17), says Love, using a tone of authority that, though mild, insures the child's obedience.17 And so the soul obeys, and the process and aims of accommodation in all its senses are accomplished. The two are reconciled, the soul obliges its host, and in so doing it is admitted into the "reall union" with Christ in his kingdom. The finality, the closure, of the last couplet appears even more emphatic here if one considers the convention of the symbolic accommodation that it modifies so delicately but distinctly: the ritual of communion. On earth, this sacrament serves as a recurrent reminder of the heavenly banquet and marriage to come; but no such implication of future earthly recurrence is found in the poem. Ordinarily one kneels and rises again to continue the earthly pilgrimage. In Herbert's conclusion, to sit and eat declares the end of that journey and the beginning of a new life that no symbols, no words, no human poetry could ever accommodate. 16/The fundamental identity of the soul and its maker is also implicit in the situation of "host" and "guest," which are etymologically akin: each is derived from the root hostias. 17/A similar change of the speaker's attitude occurs in "The Collar," in which obedience is evoked as the grounds of the protest shift from the context of a master/slave relationship to that of father/child. The use of the word "Lord" here in st. 3 is as subtle as other usages discussed. Archaic meanings include "head of household" and "husband." "Lord" is itself derived from the Old English word that means "keeper of the bread."</page><page sequence="7">Williams/ Herbert's "Love III" 19 III This explication rather thoroughly documents that accommodation provides a contextual center, a kind of logos for "Love III." To read the poem as a multi- faceted pun on various meanings of "accommodation" might, at first glance, appear simply to establish "Love III" as a continuous, sustained, and sophisticated (though miniature) allegory in the Renaissance tradition. To assume that the poem is allegorical does indeed provide answers to some of the questions mentioned above: for example, Stanley Fish's conclusion that the speaker is "killed with kindness" appears in this light as having been fostered by a misapprehension of genre. In sustained allegory, one is not alarmed by but indeed expects magical resolutions.' In other words, it is inappropriate to anticipate in Love's interaction with the soul the psychological realism of a Romantic or post-Romantic lyric. The requirement that the soul "sit and eat" (line 18) is not sinister but infinitely reassuring. But a more careful consideration of the poem as allegory reveals that its structure is highly atypical. The poem contains the familiar signs of allegorical intention (i.e., it begins with a character named "Love"), and its sentence or allos, which I take to be "the accommodations of divine grace," is embodied in the concrete level, as in any successful allegory. The peculiar dimension of the allegory, however, is the unusual role of accommodation as the single informing idea. I can think of no other instance in the literary works commonly deemed allegorical in which the concrete narrative is so entirely an embodiment of the multiple implica- tions of a single term. By definition, conventional allegory is a structure in which the concrete narrative consistently corresponds to an equivalent symbolic, spiritual plot.19 For example, one might depict Redcrosse's battle with Error (in The Faerie Queene, bk. 1, canto 1) by means of two parallel horizontal lines. The lower one, representing the concrete level, tells of the knight's struggle with a dragon. But the progress of this action has a consistent spiritual or intellectual dimension, so that as we read we simultaneously plot the course of Holiness's confrontation with spiritual falsehood and deception, ignorance and blindness. If we try to construct a similar diagram for "Love III," however, we can only envision it as an equilateral triangle. If the base line of the form represents the concrete level, every point on it directs one's attention to the concept of accommodation, poised at the top; the shape and texture of the lyric seem to radiate from this one idea.20 18/See, for example, Angus Fletcher, Allegory: The Theory of a Symbolic Mode (Ithaca, N.Y., 1964), pp. 25 ff. 19/The definition of allegory is obviously more problematic than I have indicated. Here I am adhering to the definition commonly found in literary handbooks, such as M. H. Abrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms, 4th ed. (New York, 1981). 20/This relationship may remind the reader of the relation in dreams that Freud sees between manifest and latent content, on the assumption that dreams are a means by which ineffable, unconscious configura- tions partially manifest themselves in symbolic narratives. Considered strictly as the depth psychologist would regard a dream, the poem is, in Freudian terms, highly overdetermined: every aspect of every element points back to the same ruling concept. But as we have seen, the fund of symbols to which Herbert turned itself manifests various aspects of accommodation--the concept was inherent or latent in the poetic symbolism whether the poet consciously realized this presence or not. Hence the concept's peculiar relationship to the concrete (manifest) level. It remains partly hidden, private, a product of the conflict between the two contrary impulses in the poem, between the desire to image the unimaginable and the impossibility of altogether doing so (corresponding to Freud's notion of compromise formation). Thus we may infer the concept of accommodation, but we see it "through a glass, darkly," translated into the numerous elements of this fiction.</page><page sequence="8">20 Modern Philology (August 1984) What kind of poem, then, is "Love III"? It cannot be justly termed an allegory, although the immaterial concept of accommodation appears to determine its fictional elements, including its narrative. We are, however, also accustomed to calling it a lyric. Indeed it is short, has a first-person speaker, and comes at the end of a long series of poems, most of which are unquestionably lyrics-the other "Love" poems, for example, are sonnets. Yet the informing principle of the lyric tends to be something within the speaker's psyche, and this poem has at least as much narrative as expression. In fact, we might be reminded of that favorite Romantic hybrid, the lyrical ballad, because here, as in many such poems, the action--especially the conclusion--makes sense only in terms of implied psycho- logical change within the narrative consciousness.21 This generic analogy, while anachronistic, illuminates the relation between speaker and plot but still does not account for the power of the ordering symbolic dimension, the principle of accommodation. But if we want to coin a name for the genre of "Love III," we could call it a "lyrical parable." The meaning of "parable," like the related term "allegory," is controversial. Until the Reformation, the biblical parables were interpreted as allegories, as consistent symbolic narratives in which the concrete level consistently pointed to an allos-other, sacred meaning. In the parable of the Good Samaritan, for example, the traveler is Adam, Jerusalem the paradise from which he has fallen, Jericho a symbol of human mortality, the thieves the devil and his angels who strip the traveler of his immortality, and so on.22 Among post-Reformation interpreters it remained unresolved as to whether these narratives of humble things were intended to fulfill the allegorical function of concealing mysteries known only to the elect or whether they sought precisely the opposite: to reveal the truth to unbelievers through the everyday and familiar.23 During the past century or so, biblical scholars have tended to assume the latter position. An influential contemporary definition of the parable considers it to be a metaphor from everyday life extended into a narrative; such a reading would consider the parable of the Good Samaritan as a complex but consistent narrative embodiment of the concept of "the good neighbor." The relationship between the concrete and the symbolic, by this definition, is that which I have discerned in "Love III." A further important insight about the nature of parables has been proposed by Robert W. Funk, who argues that, although the concrete level of the biblical parable deals with the world of ordinary experience, there is nevertheless within the course of the narrative some reversal or disjunction that signals to the listener the special otherworldly significance of the story. This is the everyday world, we see, but turned "inside out or upside down."24 (Even the phrase "Good Samaritan" would have been heard as an oxymoron by Christ's audience.) 21/Aside from the Wordsworthian narrative technique in which external gestures imply psychological complexity, the poem is also balladlike in its simplicity of language and its structure of question and answer. 22/This is Augustine's reading, paraphrased by C. H. Dodd, The Parables of the Kingdom, rev. ed. (New York, 1961), pp. 1-2. 23/For a helpful survey of contemporary debate on the question of how parables mean, see Norman Perrin, Jesus and the Language of the Kingdom: Symbol and Metaphor in New Testament Interpretation (Philadelphia, 1976). 24/ Robert W. Funk, Language, Hermeneutic, and the Word of God (New York, 1966), p. 161.</page><page sequence="9">Williams/ Herbert's "Love III" 21 A second important development in the study of parables during the past quarter century or so is that biblical scholars have begun to use the insights of literary criticism as well as the context of biblical hermeneutics in their readings. If one is to read the parable as an extended metaphor, then one must also consider the nature and function of metaphor, an issue that has recently elicited an enormous amount of discussion (and disagreement) among literary critics as well as among investigators in several other disciplines. John Dominic Crossan has profitably adapted some literary speculations about metaphor to the reading of parables. He writes: "Figurative language has two quite different functions. One is to illustrate information so that information precedes participation. The other is to create participation, so that participation precedes information."25 In other words, one fully comprehends an allegory like The Faerie Queene only if one already knows a good deal about Christian doctrine, Renaissance philosophy, English politics, and so on ("information precedes participation"). One possible function of metaphor (and hence parable), however, is just the opposite: the metaphor stretches our minds beyond the boundaries of previous conceptions. As Crossan writes, "It talks of A so that we may participate in [for which I understand 'imagine'] B, or more accurately, it talks of x so that one may participate in X." The humble, earthly narrative of the parable (x) reveals the Kingdom of Heaven (X).26 How does this brief discussion about modes of interpreting biblical parables help us to read "Love III"? First, in recognizing Herbert's poem as a narrative that, as we have seen, is an extended metaphor for "the accommodation of divine grace" we see a valid generic affinity. If not a retelling of the parables, it is an example of a parable, and that fact implies a particular interpretive strategy. Like a biblical parable, it concerns a commonplace subject, the welcome of the guest at the inn. But it proceeds in such a way that the metaphor reveals aspects of divine grace hitherto unimagined. "Information precedes participation," we could say. Further- more, the careful reader of the poem notices in this apparently commonplace narrative those reversals or signals of strangeness that are, according to Funk, characteristic of parabolic narrative. From this viewpoint, the first line is startling, even shocking: "Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back." Although the service of communion is soon evoked, it is turned "inside out [and] upside down." The more one considers this fictional situation in comparison to the earthly celebration of the feast, the stranger and hence more unearthly it seems. In The Country Parson Herbert writes that it is the duty of the parson (who is "in God's stead" on earth) to act as Love does here: he talks of the parson's ideal "courtesy," charity, his comforting of his flock, his acting as father to them, his catechizing of them, and, perhaps most important, his administration of the sacraments.27 These roles are, of course, reversed throughout "Love III," and the clause "My deare, then I will serve" becomes yet another pun when we remember that "serve" is the verb designating the pastor's administration of communion. Read as a parable, however, the poem shows its most striking reversal in the final line, "So I did sit and eat." In The Country Parson Herbert writes: "The Feast 25/John Dominic Crossan, In Parahles: The Challenge of the Historical Jesus (New York, 1975), p. 15. 26/ Ibid., p. 16. 27/ Hutchinson, ed., pp. 225 ff.</page><page sequence="10">22 Modern Philology (August 1984) indeed requires sitting, because it is a Feast; but man's unpreparedness asks kneeling. Hee that comes to the Sacrament hath the confidence of a Guest, and hee that kneels, confesseth himself an unworthy one and therefore differs from other Feasters."28 In this world a reverent and humble communicant will always kneel, and hence the last line is sublime in its simplicity and finality. It would therefore seem that in Herbert's mind "Love III" was unequivocally an adumbration of the celestial banquet. Herbert's most admirable qualities as a poet are frequently attributed to the tension in his verse between the public and the private, the universal and the individual, between an inherited system of doctrines and the soul's private responses to experience that at once affirms its individuality and its universality. Thus a final dimension of accommodation in "Love III" is Herbert's adaptation of a biblical narrative genre, the parable, to the perspective of the lyric; that is, to private, imagined experience. This accommodation is, from a theological point of view, perhaps the only way The Temple could end: with a parable that allows us to participate before we may know. Aesthetically, it is also a fitting conclusion to the drama of spiritual anguish, anger, pathos, joy, and despair that has been recorded in The Temple. Its simplicity of idiom declares its sublime resolution of worldly vicissitudes into the transcendent, wordless peace of Love's realm. University of Georgia 28/Ibid., p. 259.</page></plain_text>
