<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES Vol. V, No. 19. JULY 1930 SCIENCE AND ART Professor S. ALEXANDER I My object in these lectures l is to show that Science is a form of Art, though not of fine art; in other words, that it is one example of a process of which fine art is the most obvious example, the process of making out of certain materials a result into which the mind itself enters. Clearly enough the material of the artist, whatever it be, marble or paints or tones or words, is moulded by the artist into a shape which it would not possess unless something in the artist's mind found expression in it. Science also is a product of the mind's interference and is artifieial. But it differs from fine art, I shall try to show, in this respect: in fine art the material is controlled from the mind, or at least it is principally controlled from the mind. In science the material is the facts of nature (including of course the mind itself as a natural object); but while science would not be except for the mind of the scientist, the work is controlled from the side of the material itself, and his mind is instrumental to the product rather than in some sense intrinsic to it as in fine art. It will suit my purpose best to begin by tracing in general outline how science grows, through the interaction of the two elements in it which I have called the material and the mind. It grows out of what used to be called history, as by Bacon, that is a collection of facts; and is most easily illustrated from what we call history. We may see the first approaches to scientific history in our newspapers, which consist of two parts, the bare facts collected as news and the comments on the facts in the leaders. The leaders are reflections 1 Delivered in the University of Manchester, November 1929, and in London for the British Institute of Philosophical Studies, February 1930. 331</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES upon or interpretations of the news in the light of the policy or principles professed by its editor, in politics or literature or economics or music and the like, according to the journars interest. But it fails to be a science for two reasons: First that its principles, if it is an ordinary newspaper, are practical and concerned with affecting public action; and secondly, that news and leaders are strung together and are not organically connected. However, in a great newspaper like The Times or The Manchester Guardian there is a pervading spirit which, to a certain extent, approximates the paper to a work of science. Such a newspaper is a great deal more than a mere chronicle, for it reviews facts in the light of ideas. We get history proper when the ideas which the writer brings to his news or facts are no longer purely practical but theoretical. This at least is the first element in the transition from the journal to history. The facts are co- ordinated not so as to serve as the text for policies of practice, but so as to bring out the meaning of the events of the period under consideration. The meaning of the facts is gathered by the historian's mind, using its appropriate ideas?which are suggested by the facts themselves but acquire distinctness as he goes on?because he starts hypotheses as to the significance of his subject, and is helped therein by all kinds of knowledge or imagination that he brings with him from his knowledge of life or from his acquaintance with other periods of history. All these helps or adminicula he uses as the leader-writer uses his practical principles, and there would be no history proper except for his intervention. But we note at the same time that how? ever fertile he may be in his resources of interpretation, he is bound, on pain of being unhistorical, to keep strictly to the facts, or as I put it, he is, for all his artistry or manipulation, controlled by his material. To arrive at their meaning he must select, and he may illustrate or interpret so as to co-ordinate the facts, to make the essentials stand out and the trifling or inessential data slip out of the focus, to get a consistent picture if he can or so far as he can. But he is a scientific historian only if in organizing his material he does not distort. He would not naturally falsify, but falsification may come about in effect, not in intention, if he selects, say, to heighten the picturesqueness of his narrative or to over-emphasize salient features of a character or of a party. In this process from the chronicle to the history we can see thus both science and art, as fine art, playing their part, and always because of the mind's intervention. Various histories illustrate these features in differing degrees. Gardiner's history of the Civil War betrays very little of the artist, but is an admirable example of scientific history, which, far away as it is from the chronicle, and bringing out the great movements in men's minds during that period, 332</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE AND ART and even full of luminous ideas of statesmanship which the author brings to the understanding of human things, is, as far as a layman can judge, rigidly faithful to his data, impartial and even austere, so much so as perhaps to repel. On the other hand, Macaulay is far more of an artist, and sometimes forsakes the duty of the historian to use the freedom of the artist, by onesidedness, and what must be called, however agreeable is its effect, abstractness, heightening the colours or the shadows, and sometimes not free from prejudice. In judging the greatness of a historian both scales have doubtless to be used. The co-ordination of facts by ideas supplied from the mind, or at least through the mind's action, and yet moulded to the facts, is, however, not the whole of the difference between history and chronicle. Along with the work of organizing there goes the process of testing the facts themselves, so as to secure precision. Thus the facts which control are themselves in part the outcome of the effort to create the work of art which embodies them. This demands in the historian expertness in description, and has led to technical sciences like palaeography or chronology, the first example of which last science was, I believe, the elder Scaliger's work; and it requires skill in estimating the value of evidence, the skill of the scientific judge&gt; so as to sort out the data which are worthy of belief. So intimately then is the scientific treatment of facts dependent on the historian's mind, not only for collating ideas but for establishment of the facts themselves. When history takes its higher flights, as in recording the whole life of a nation, or still more when it becomes comparative, as it unavoidably does, and includes many nations; or when it traces a department of civilization (e.g. Lecky's two famous works), or reaches to what has been attempted as the philosophy of history? it exhibits more and more the use of hypothesis to supply con? necting clues, the larger sweep of mind which can make a con- spectus of great tracts of time and human motives at work therein, and betrays more and more the controlled art, and therefore not fine art, which is exhibited at its lower level in any historical work that can be called scientific. It has sometimes been denied that history can ever be a science, except so far as scientific methods are used in the technical ascer- tainment of facts. It should be clear by now that this is only partially true and misses the essential. It is only true in the sense that history is not physical science, for when it begins to furnish laws of human nature or generalizations, it tends to lose its character of history and to become the science of sociology. Even within its proper range it is scientific, like the biological sciences, because of its control by its material. 333</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES But it does in another respect resemble rather fine art than science. For it is concerned with individuals and series of individuals, and individualization as contrasted with generalization is a distinctive mark of art. Hence the close affinity of history with the drama. Even so a contrast of real history with one of Shakespeare's Histories, or with what closely resembles these in our own time, Mr. Strachey's Elizabeth and Essex, is enough to mark off history from fine art. For these dramas claim the freedom of art from control by the facts, and use the narrative not as history but as material to exhibit play of character under historical names, and they have thus the universality which Aristotle made the character? istic of drama. History is, in fact, a connecting and transitional link between science and fine art, sharing with the one its subjection to things and with the other its limitation to individual existence. Although history is the form of science which is the least devel? oped in the sense that it is more like literature than other sciences, our description of it has brought out the two features which it shares with every science. The first is the freedom which it owes to the movement of the mind amongst the facts, organizing them so as to make them significant, much in the same way as the astronomer groups his stars into constellations (an example used so often by Mr. Eddington). The second is the restriction of the mind in this process by the facts themselves, much as if the stars compelled the astronomer, by virtue of their special relations to each other inde? pendently of their mere spatial proximity, so to group them, as the parts of an animal body compel us to consider them as more inti? mately connected with each other than with things outside them. Now it is this second feature of control of the mind by the material which is so palpable in history when we compare it with the other sciences or with fine art. What distinguishes the natural sciences, and above all the physical sciences and mathematics, is the increasing entry into them of the mind's freedom of construction. The biological sciences mark the transition to physical science; they are more like history and less like mathematics, and there is consequently less artifice in them than in physics. Between them and physics comes chemistry, which is fast approaching the condition of a branch of physics. Botany and zoology begin as natural history, and they retain to the end the qualitative character, which increasingly disappears from science to be replaced by the metrical or quantitative character. 'History' or the collection of facts in biology, as it becomes more methodical and systematic and precise, becomes dignified with the name of morphology. But as these sciences grow and become more scientific, that is approach to the ideas of the physical sciences, not 334</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE AND ART only does generalization enter, but measurement; and again, intro- ducing experiment, they become physiological and admit of the statement of laws. Darwinism illustrates excellently both these aspects. It is a qualitative theory, and not a metrical one. At the same time it is an immense historical comprehension, and indeed it strikes the note of the historical method in science, which came to be so marked a feature in thought as men's minds swung back from the rationalism of the eighteenth century and from the so-called mechanical philosophy. It may be noted, by the way, that Mr. White? head's introduction of the idea of organism into physics and philo? sophy is avowedly a reaction from the mechanistic philosophy of physics in our own day, after the triumphs which that philosophy had won in actual physical investigations right on to the end of the nineteenth century. Moreover, Darwinism, besides being a great historical synthesis, offered in the notion of natural selection a physical law regulating the historical procession. With Mendelism we have introduced into historical biology the metrical method of statistics, and something in biology approaching the atomic theory in physics and chemistry, in the search after units, still qualitative and far removed from the units of chemistry, underlying the gene- alogy of living forms. Perhaps the best illustration of the effect of experiment on the lifting of biology from history to science or artifiee is to be seen in the growth of scientific medicine. Medicine, which in its beginnings is purely empirical (for I need not go back to its kinship with religion), owes its scientific standing to physiology, which does not merely observe, or even employ experiment as a help to observation as in statistical inquiries, but relies from the beginning on experimental interference with the course of life, and is able to establish laws. At the same time, if any one needed convincing of the artifieial character of science, he has only to observe how completely this master science of life is a creation of the mind by observing that for the most part in his experiments the physiologist isolates the separate portions of the body, as for instance in a nerve preparation, and observes the laws or regularities of their separate workings. He has consequently to correct this artificiality by precautions to interfere as little as possible with the organic connections of the part under experiment, as for instance in careful vivisectional experiments. I may instance the knowledge acquired by experiment of the co-ordination or integration of nervous impulses and of the paths which nerve impulses travel. Sometimes by events, which are disastrous for the patient but fortunate for science, nervous lesions from disease or war may take the place of experiment, as in the well-known observations of Sir Henry Head. At the same time, in pointing out how science grows away from 335</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES history through artifice, and the increasing share of the mind in its creations, I am intending no depreciation of history as such. It will, in fact, be one of my main contentions that science, even at its acme in physics and mathematics, never frees itself completely of history, and artificial as it is this dependence on history prevents it from being artistic. Chemistry, which comes next in the series, is so interesting from our point of view because almost under our eyes it has been changing from a historical to a semi-physical science. Qualitative it remains: the elements are distinct in quality as much as the species of animals and plants. But there have been two processes going on, which are not altogether distinct from each other. One is the mitiga- tion of the qualitative distinctness of chemical substances by uniting the elements into one great synthesis comparable to the Darwinian synthesis in biology; the other the way in which the conception of the molecules and the atoms has become geometrical, a process described so excellently by Mr. Meyerson in his book La Deduction Relativiste.1 Already chemistry had learned to shed fictitious qualita? tive conceptions like those of caloric and phlogiston, which were in fact the qualities of heat and combustibility made into substances, very much in the same way as the early Greek physicists thought of love and strife, which were causes of mixture and separation, as being physical things or elements like the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Mr. Meyerson happily recalls (ch. xxii) the "dormitive virtue" of opium, by which Moliere's candidate for a degree in medicine declares that opium makes us sleep. These virtues became actual substances. But when once these fictions were banished by Lavoisier at the end of the eighteenth century, there began the attempts to relate the different elements to one another which culminated in Mendeleef's great synthesis. According to this the elements, when arranged in the order of their atomic weights, fell into groups or constellations, which repeated each other in their chemical and physical properties. The presumption under? lying the synthesis is that the elements are connected together genealogically, and are ultimately derived from some one substance by descent. This has, of course, been confirmed by the discoveries made about radium, certain elements being experimentally produced from others through loss of the constituent electrons. So far the movement has been comparable to the Darwinian synthesis, but more penetrating. But along with this, and in fact part of the same movement, there has gone the spatializing of which Mr. Meyerson speaks, by which molecules are exhibited as containing their atoms in a certain spatial 1 Paris, 1925. 336</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE AND ART arrangement, the atoms holding hands as it were in a kind of dance. Many years ago W. K. Clifford compared the molecule of benzene to a game of "here we go round the mulberry tree" played by a ring of children. Moreover, not only is the molecule spatialized in this physical chemistry, but in recent times the atom itself has been spatialized into the conception of a central nucleus made up of units of positive and negative electricity, with electrons or units of negative electricity revolving around it in orbits like those of the planets. Whether this conception is final remains to be seen; it has apparently broken down under the difficulties presented by the quantum theory. Those difficulties, however, concern the notion that the electrons can be treated as if they were small pieces of matter. It would still remain that in the advance of chemistry, as the science is handed over more and more to the physicists, the qualitative character of the science is replaced by a metrical character. For us, what is chiefly to be noted is that chemistry, in ceasing to be purely qualitative, has become more abstract, for it is more abstract to identify a colour by the wave-length of its light than by its sensible property. More science, if it means greater power to the mind in comprehension of its material, means also greater assertion of the mental element in the science and greater intrusion of artifice. For reasons of convenience, I propose, instead of passing on directly to physics and mathematics, to dwell on a further aspect of the artificiality of science which would more properly come at the end of the survey of the sciences. Hitherto, in the historical and semi-historical sciences, I have been concerned to indicate how the science depends for its existence on the entry of the mind by means of its hypotheses and co-ordinating notions. It has, however, been sufficiently plain that the freedom of the mind's movement has been rather instrumental than constitutive; though when we come to physical chemistry, the spatial construction of the molecules has been eminently a piece of the mind's own ingenuity. Still, the ideas which the mind uses, though inventions of the mind, have been directly suggested by the facts considered, and what is more im? portant, the characters of things embodied in the ideas belong clearly to the things themselves. Natural selection, for instance, in the beginning a hypothesis, was not only suggested to Darwin's mind by the procedure of animal breeders, but so far as it is estab? lished is a process which is actually operative among animals or plants. In fact, the doubts now raised which call the theory in question are doubts as to the limits of the process in actual fact. The arrangement of the atoms in the molecule is actually, or at least pretends to be actually, present in the molecules. Such ideas are on quite a different footing from the idea of a twelve- or even a 337</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES five-dimensional world adopted for convenience in manipulation of certain formulae without supposing that the actual world is twelve- or five-dimensional. When we come to the physical sciences, the freedom of the mind is so obvious that the difficulty rather is to convince ourselves that in the more speculative branches of physics the science is not wholly an invention of the mind. Parts of these subjects appear to be in the position of the statue which suggests life, though it is dead marble, because the artist has put the life there. I anticipate, there? fore, the impression produced in these sciences by illustrating the extreme freedom of procedure which the mind assumes to itself in its normal, or, if you like, logical, procedure. Logic may be regarded as a science even more abstract than physics or mathematics. Now the reasonings of the mind about things are conducted with regard to the mind's own procedure and convenience. The most notable instance of this is the substitution of reasons for natural or physical connections, or, as Bradley puts it, of the "because" for the cause. A cause is always a reason, but a reason is not always a cause. He gives two illustrations: "Two coins are proved to have similar inscriptions because they each are like a third, but the cause is not found in this interrelation. The cause is the origin from a common die. If a vessel has sailed for London or Liverpool, and we know that it has not sailed for the former, we argue that its course is shaped for the latter. But is our middle a process of actual causation?" The physical cause is the will of the captain or the instructions of the owners. Now inference is the logical procedure of science, and we use our evidence according to the mind's rules. There is a general logical technique of the sciences over and above the special methods used in special sciences to suit the different subject-matter. This seems to make science artificial from the beginning. We argue, as in the above examples, from what Aristotle called signs instead of causes: since the barometer is falling there is a storm; or from alternatives, and yet it is in our mind that the alternatives are. Or we argue from probabilities, which means upon the strength of evidence, but of evidence which does not amount to proof. And I believe that probability is become a most important part of technical science. But in so far as evidence is insufficient, we reason according to our rules and not from causes. It must not be supposed that therefore logical methods in their freedom, and as it were their emancipation from natural control, are in reality uncontrolled or arbitrary. On the contrary, on mere general considerations, we have to remember that the mind is itself (at least for our present purposes) a part of nature, and if it succeeds in trying to know about things by following its own nature, we are bound to suppose it is adapted to things, much as an animal persists 338</page><page sequence="9">SCIENCE AND ART because it can make use of its surroundings, and the surroundings respond to it in its reactions to them. Moreover, although reasons are not causes, yet reasons are founded on causes; ultimately in the instance of the three coins the coins themselves and the die which stamps them belong together in one system. Alternatives exist in our thought, but things do admit of being arranged into classes which exclude each other; or a kind of event may be produced in different ways, and in this sense there are real alternatives in nature. It has even been maintained that chance is not a mere name for our ignorance or for the insufficiency of our evidence, but in a certain sense really exists, though that sense can hardly yet be regarded as clearly explained. Further, we shall see that in the special ideas of the sciences the mind is perpetually seeking to interpret its own creations in terms of physical things. Thus we invent negative numbers, and straightway interpret them as distances in the opposite direction; or the symbol of imaginary quantity V-i is interpreted geometrically in the manner explained by Mr. Whitehead in his Introduction to Mathematics. It still remains true, however far the mind succeeds in establishing a connection between its own creations and things, it follows in making science its own bent: the real numbers, for instance, owe their existence to the generalizing of number of which Mr. Whitehead speaks. Truth, therefore, which is the work of scientific inquiry is not the same thing as reality, however closely it corresponds to reality. It needs the mind for its existence, and only as held in the mind's embrace is it legitimate to speak of truth. We have now to realize the other side of the scientific art, that even in its highest and most abstract flights it is controlled by things and is in other words experimental. I return now, from this interruption, to the exact sciences of physics and mathematics, and here again I shall be concerned to exhibit the two features we have found in the quasi-historical sciences, their artificiality and their control by the facts. That it is an art is more obvious of physics than its control by a non-mental reality. For at an early stage physics becomes metrical and ceases to aim at merely qualitative propositions, such as that heat expands bodies. In doing so, in abstracting from the sensible characters of things, it is plainly the work of the mind. And in its later stages, in its efforts at explanation it has long passed the ideal of a collection of empirical laws so carefully stated as to be called causal laws. Even the principle stated by Kelvin, that explanation is only satis? factory when it is possible to construct a mechanical model, has apparently ceased to be accepted. And at the present time, owing to 339</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES two theories, that of relativity and the quantum theory, the ultimate formulation of physical laws involves a mass of constructions by the mind which aim at any rate at making physics purely a mental work, corresponding, no doubt, in some sense to the objects of per? ception, and yet hardly to be described as dealing, however indirectly, with those objects. It is not my business, nor indeed is it within my competence, to describe these two great modern theories. I am only concerned with them in so far as they raise philosophical problems bearing upon the present topic. But roughly I may put them thus. The theory of relativity issues from the replacement of space and time by space- time. The world, instead of being a set of things extended in space which have a history in time, is a world of events, is a four-dimen- sional world, and not merely a three-dimensional one which proceeds forward in time. This of itself is enough to dispose of the idea we use in practice of things or substances. Force, which we become acquainted with directly in our own muscular exertions, has long evaporated and given way to the purely metrical conception of the accelerations of bodies to each other. And now substance, an idea which again is suggested by experience of ourselves, is seen to be only a way of describing a group of cohering events, cohering, that is to say, closely enough to be singled out and named. So far physics only continues the process of getting rid of anthropomorphic con? ceptions. But now the theory of relativity goes on to insist that the separation of space-time into space and time is relative to the, point of view (which may be that of a human observer, but need not be) from which the dissection is made. Since the points of view are generally those of human observers, this at first sight makes division into space and time the work of the mind. The quantum theory is again, to speak very roughly, a theory founded on the discovery that energy exists in units or bundles of units, and not in continuous quantities, so that, for instance, light is given off from an atom in multiples of a certain unit. This atomicity of things provokes a variety of different explanations with which I have nothing to do; but at any rate the conceptions which they employ, some more than others, imply a high degree of mental construction and remoteness from sensible notions. It has even been said that the older notions of the perception of things have to be revised for the new infra-microscopic world into which atoms are resolved. Physicists are now occupied with the relation between the older classical physics and the laws of this new region of action. These inquiries throw into high relief the immensely artificial character of physics, at least in its present state of advance; and they seem to throw doubt on the idea I have used, that however much of an art a science is, it is still under control from a non-mental reality. 340</page><page sequence="11">SCIENCE AND ART Fortunately we have for ourselves in these matters such guides as Mr. Russell's A.B.C. of Relativity and his A.B.C. of Atoms, as well as his more systematic works, The Analysis of Matter and Introduction to Philosophy; and as Mr. Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World, which may be regarded as a fuller restatement of his article on 'The Domain of Physical Science" in the volume of essays called Science, Religion, and Reality, published in 1925. It will be convenient to take Mr. Eddington as a text for our remarks, because with him the artistic or artifieial character of physics comes out so strongly, and the element of what I have called control drops apparently into the background, which is the very point I am wishing to question. Physics itself is a closed circle into which the study of conscious? ness does not enter, but physical objects are metrical constructions which imply the action of the mind, much as the shape of the statue implies the artist's chisel. The objects of physics are groups of metrical characters which are not perceptual objects, but only symbolic of them. In a striking passage Mr. Eddington writes (p. 254): "Our knowledge of the external world cannot be divorced from the nature of the appliances with which we have obtained the know? ledge." I add the following sentence because of its bearing on what comes later. "The truth of the law of gravitation cannot be regarded as subsisting apart from the experimental procedure by which we have ascertained its truth." The symbols in question are, in fact, "pointer-readings" from various instruments of measurement. Physics attends only to these readings of weight, temperature, speed, and the like; so that in his familiar illustration of the elephant rolling down a grassy slope, we have one set of pointer-readings "moving" according to another set down a slope also recorded by a reading of its angle. All this is perfectly clear. What is not so clear is that these readings are purely symbolic of the perceptual object, and not merely an abstraction from that object of its metrical characters; in which case the "physical object" would really belong to the per? ceptual object, in a sense in which the life inspired by the sculptor into the marble does not belong to the material, though of course the physical notation might be very indirect. How much Mr. Eddington emphasizes the part played by mental construction in the making of physical science is best seen by follow? ing as far as possible his account of what he calls world-building; how by starting with elements described in the most abstract way possible as relata and the relations between them, and assigning to each relatum four numbers constituting a monomark (an abstract idea used to avoid calling the numbers co-ordinates which imply space and time), we can exhibit the structure of the world in a formula in which the coefficients correspond to certain concrete concepts like space, time, and gravitation, electricity and magnetism. In 341</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES this way we, as it were, build up the familiar world out of abstract numbers and their combinations, and can derive certain of the laws of experimental physics. But the way in which mind enters can only be understood when we follow him in the division which he makes of the laws of Nature into three types. He distinguishes (p. 244) (1) identical laws, (2) statistical laws, (3) transcendental laws. The identifies are the laws of conservation of energy, and momentum, and even the law of gravitation, the inclusion of which is one of the most remarkable of his results, one which most provokes reflection. They are "the laws obeyed as mathe? matical identifies in virtue of the ways in which the quantities obeying them are built." They cannot be regarded as genuine laws of control by the basal material of the world. More than once he calls these fundamental laws a "put-up job," or truisms, though headds (p. 237) "not truisms when approached in the way mind looks out on the world, but truisms when we encounter them in a building up of the world from a basal structure." We find them in nature because we have "ordered" nature as it were in this form. We have a passion for permanence, or an interest in it, the same interest which underlies our idea of substance. "The law of conservation is a truism for the things which satisfy it; but its prominence in the scheme of law of the physical world is due to the mind having demanded permanence." (p. 241). It is as if the bursar of a college should think that he has discovered something in the real life of the college by finding that the accounts balance; he has but arranged that incomings are plus and outgoings minus. In the same way as the different aspects in which the realities of the college overlap in the world of accounts, so the law of conservation represents "the overlapping of the different aspects in which the 'non-emptiness of space' presents itself to our practical experience. . . . We can measure certain forms of energy with a thermometer, momentum with a ballistic pendulum, stress with a manometer. Commonly we picture these as separate physical entities whose behaviour towards each other is controlled by a law. But now the theory is that the three instruments measure different but slightly overlapping aspects of a single physical condi? tion, and a law connecting their measurements is of the same tauto- logical type as a law' connecting measurements with a metre-rule and a foot-rule" (p. 239). He adds, however, that "the proviso must be remembered, grant ing that the identification [of their subject-matter]" i.e. of energy, momentum, and stress, with certain 'principal curvatures' of the world, "is correct. . . . From a practical point of view the law would be upset if it turned out that the thing conserved was not that which we are accustomed to measure with the above-mentioned instruments, but something slightly different" (p. 239). 342</page><page sequence="13">SCIENCE AND ART I will quote another paragraph because of its bearing upon what follows. Though consciousness is not itself included in the cycle of physics, yet according to Mr. Eddington it exercises "a selective influence on the laws of Nature by choosing the patterns which suit itself." And this (p. 243), is to say "that values are created by the mind. All the 'light and shade' in our conception of the world of physics comes in this way from the mind, and cannot be explained without reference to the characteristics of consciousness." That value, at any rate the highest value, such as truth, is created by mind seems to me eminently true. But the question still remains whether the creation depends on the characteristics of consciousness, as I shall urge beauty does, where, for instance, the mind inserts into the marble characters which do not belong to the marble; or whether the mind in science is not rather truly selective, taking from nature by selection what is really already in nature. I shall return to this later. Meantime let me resume the enumera? tion of the types of natural law. Besides the identical laws, there are secondly statistical laws, of which the chief is the second law of thermodynamics, that is the law of the running down of energy in the world into the form of heat unavailable for work (the loss of available energy being known as entropy). "Statistical laws," to quote further, "relate to the behaviour of crowds, and depend on the fact that although the behaviour of each individual may be extremely uncertain, average results can be predicted with confidence. Much of the apparent uniformity of Nature is a uniformity of averages." These statistical laws, however, he does not regard as laws of control for they involve a notion of probability for which there is as yet no place in the conception of the world substratum [i.e. the basal structure] (p. 244). It is in the third group of the transcendental laws that we must seek, according to Mr. Eddington, for the genuine laws of control, if there are any. They "comprise all those which have not become obvious identities implied in the scheme of world-building. They are concerned with the particular behaviour of atoms, electrons, and quanta?that is to say, the laws of atomicity of matter, electricity, and action. We seem to be making some progress towards formulating them, but it is clear that the mind is having a much harder struggle to gain a rational conception of them than it had with the classical field-laws. We have seen that the field-laws, especially the laws of conservation, are indirectly imposed by the mind, which has, so to speak, commanded a plan of world-building to satisfy them. It is a natural suggestion that the greater difficulty in elucidating the transcendental laws is due to the fact that we are no longer engaged in recovering from Nature what we have ourselves put into Nature, but are at last confronted 343</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES with its own intrinsic system of government. But I scarcely know what to think. . . . It may be that the laws of atomicity, like the laws of conservation, arise only in the presentation of the world to us, and can be recognized as identifies by some extension of the argu? ment we have followed. But it is perhaps as likely that after we have cleared away all the superadded laws which arise solely in our mode of apprehension of the world about us, there will be left an external world developing under genuine laws of control" (p. 245). It would seem to follow from this that though the external world may be in the end recalcitrant to mind, the ideal of physics is a system of identical laws representing the mind's own will with Nature. "Where science has progressed the farthest," he says elsewhere (Space, Time, and Gravitation, p. 201) "the mind has but regained from nature that which the mind has put into nature." Such science is, of course, only "knowledge of structural form and not knowledge of content." The philosophical suggestion is that in the end the content itself is the stuff of our consciousness. This last suggestion, however, it is not necessary to consider. If the ideal of physics is the one described, physics would be completely an art, conforming to forms of structure chosen by the mind, as the sculptor imposes on his marble the form he chooses, and no part of the material but obeys this form. This would make science at its highest, in physics and mathematics, akin to fine art to a greater degree than seems, as I hope to indicate, to be the truth. Accepting from Mr. Eddington his picture of world-building as practised by science, I would ask whence the mind derives the idea of permanence which justifies us in saying that the laws of conserva? tion are identifies. So far as the statement goes, it would seem to be a creation of the mind itself. But there is something like a miracle in this supposed capacity of the mind, unprompted by experience of things themselves, to originate the notion of permanence. Pre- cedent for affirming such capacity might be found in the Kantian doctrine of the categories, such as substance and the others, which the mind introduces into the material supplied by sense; to which, however, of course, Mr. Eddington does not appeal. But at any rate, even in the Kantian doctrine, though the categories may be thought by themselves (how Kant never explains), they cannot be used by themselves. If we suggest that we experience substance in the permanence of ourselves, the answer must be made that if by our? selves we mean our bodies, these are a part of the external world already, and we derive the idea of permanence from what is non- mental. If we answer we have it in the experience of our minds alone, the answer is that we never do have experience of our minds (in what Kant called the inner sense) except in and through the experi- 344</page><page sequence="15">SCIENCE AND ART ence of some external thing?say our own body as the most familiar case or any other external body, but some external body there must be. This consideration, which is so distinctive of Kant, does not receive, I think, its fair consideration from Mr. Eddington. The mind may act wilfully in ordering its physical world, but if it does so according to ideas, those ideas seem themselves to have come from physical experience, and to be in the end empirical or experimental notions suggested by external experience, and by the self as the most familiar instance of that experience. We might go on to urge, not by way of criticism of the notion of world-building from relata and their relations, that the ideas of relata and relations themselves cannot be regarded as creations of the mind, but are nothing but abstractions of the most general aspects of concrete experience. Even the numbers which are used for monomarks of relata are supplied to the mind, not made by it. Mr. Eddington himself quotes with approval the famous saying of Kronecker about pure mathematics, that God made the integers, all else is made by the mind. In general it is safe to say that no idea attributed to the mind's own creation but is derived by it from some experience of what is not mind, or at least not without such experience. The ideas which even in a work of fine art are imported into the product by the mind are ideas not created by the mind itself, but supplied from its experience of things, not minds (unless, indeed, the artist is portraying mind itself as in a lyric poem). Doubtless these reflections do not appeal to those who, like Mr. Eddington, regard the mind's experience of itself as direct and of external things as indirect, whence he is able to speak of physical things as mere symbols of perceptions. But it seems to me as true as to Kant that it is only in and through the experience of external things that we can have experience of the mind itself, and if it is a question of which of the two is rather to be called direct, that claim must be assigned to external experience. The mind of which we have direct experience without experience of external things and through that experience is a ghost, or, to quote a phrase of Lotze's, it is as unreal as grinding without grist. I speak on these matters with some timidity, partly lest I should appear to be questioning Mr. Eddington's exposition, and partly lest I should be really failing to understand him. What I question is merely the authority ascribed to the mind. As I read the case, the ground of the law of conservation is the experimental fact that the different measurements are merely different aspects of the same reality. If we then build up the world from a basal structure, we choose forms which embody the permanence we have found in nature; we find in nature the forms of our choosing because we have chosen them after first finding them in nature. Perhaps the caveat I am making will be clearer if I go on to his ? 345</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES much more startling proposition that the law of gravitation is a truism or a "put-up job." The way in which he shows this is as follows. It is well known that according to the Einsteinian doctrine matter is present where there is a hummock or curvature in space- time ; that is to say, this wrinkling of space-time is not merely due to the presence of matter, but actually is matter. Mr. Eddington in two masterly chapters first of all expounds the law of gravitation, and then "explains" it, the explanation being that it is a truism. For what the formula in the doctrine of relativity states is that the ten principal coefficients in it vanishin empty space, or, what is the same thing in another form, that "the radius of spherical curvature of every three-dimensional section of the world, cut in any direction at any point of empty space, is always the same constant length." I must be content to ask you to accept this statement from Mr. Eddington even if you do not understand it entirely, remembering that, as he says (p. 120) "the absolute curvature at any point is measured by a single quantity called the radius of spherical curva? ture." This condition limits the possibility that the curvature of space-time should be quite arbitrary. Now we need to explain this regularity, and the explanation is this: To say that the directed radius is constant in length means that it contains the same number of metrical units, metres, or feet, etc. All length isof course relative to some unit. Thus, if the directed radius is of constant length, that must mean that the standard metre is the same fraction of the radius no matter what new position or direction the standard is moved to. But what else could it do, seeing that the radius is dis? tinctive of the region in which the measuring-rod comes to be placed? It makes itself the same fraction of this directed length as it did before in its previous position (pp. 140--3). But is this convincing? It is well known that if a rod is moving relatively to a stationary observer, and is placed in the direction of the movement, it shrinks for the stationary observer. For an observer moving with it there is no change, for his standard length shrinks in the same proportion. But in the case supposed of trans? ference of the standard from one position to another we have the standard applied not to its old radius under the new conditions, but to a new radius under new conditions. Why should we be unable to see how it can do anything else but adapt itself to the new radius? Does not the law of gravitation assert that as a matter of fact it does so, and is it not this which is the import of the law? Directly you make this assumption, which is verified in various ways, you construct your world scientifically in accordance with it. But that choice does not so far as I can see depend on our inability to imagine anything else but on this character which has been discovered of the world. Once more, if this reflection be well founded, it is not our mind which 346</page><page sequence="17">SCIENCE AND ART settles the matter, but something inherent in the external world which is formulated in the statement of the law given above. Were it not that I do not wish to digress into philosophy, I should say it is the truth that universals are an item in the world. I have dwelt at such length on Mr. Eddington's statements because he seems to me to exaggerate and even misplace the action of the mind. But before continuing this subject and indicating an alternative view, it may be as well if I digress for a moment to speak of a common misunderstanding of relativity, not irrelevant to our inquiry, but not chargeable to Mr. Eddington. It is the notion that that relativity reasserts the Kantian doctrine that space and time are merely forms of the mind and are thus subjective. What relativity asserts is not that space and time are forms of the mind, but that to separate them is an error, and that the objects of experience are events. But granted that our seeing the world in space and time is a habit due to our weakness and so far subjective, relativity does not mean that therefore our views of the world are relative to us and purely subjective. On the contrary, it means the world is such that from whatever point of view we split space-time in our measure? ments so as to get different actual measurements, the laws of physics remain the same for all observers or for every point of view. The problem, for instance, in finding a formula for gravitation is to get something true not for me or you, but true for all. "Relativity" is in fact an unfortunate word. It might be replaced were it not for the cumbrousness of the phrase by absoluteness in spite of relativity. Mr. Meyerson has made clear (p. 212 of his La Deduction Relativiste) that what the theory aims at is the objective. This is relevant for us, because it means that the universe is such as allowing our minds to use the numbers appropriate to the relative positions and motions of the mind requires them to conform to laws dictated to them and not by them. Thus, while it is true, as Mr. Eddington says in a passage I have quoted above, that our knowledge of the external world is bound up with our instruments for attaining it, that knowledge, if it is to be true knowledge, that is knowledge at all, is limited by the com- mands of the universe itself. This may be otherwise expressed by pointing out that the instruments we use in obtaining knowledge are devised by us, in the same way as our instincts and other human capacities are acquired in the course of animal history, in the process of adapting ourselves in order to live in the world to the nature of the world itself, as indeed is indicated by Mr. Eddington himself in a later passage. The suggestion, then, is that it is not as expressing itself that the mind makes the work of art or artifice called physics, but that it creates its work through its instrumentality, not importing into 347</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES nature ideas of its own or due primarily to itself, but using its tools so as to fashion out the form of nature by obedience to her. Perhaps we might find an analogy which is not too f ar-f etched in the unfinished Slaves of Michelangelo, where the figure appears to emerge from the marble block. Overpowering as the impression is that we receive from these works, because they show how the great man worked, the adherence of the shapeless block is an accident. In physics it is as if what is an accident in art is part of the essence; as if the form of the slave which is due to Michelangelo were accidental and the marble to whose nature he has to conform were essential. If this be so, it would remain true that in the highest and most abstract science control is not as Mr. Eddington uses the word, from laws of the basal structure chosen by the mind, but ultimately, sooner or later, the control is from the external world, which is primarily presented to our minds in perception, just as it is admitted to be in the verification by which ordinary experimental laws are established; or for the matter of that in the theory of relativity itself, which was established because it was found to work. According to this there is no discontinuity between the crude stuff of perception and the most abstract thoughts, it is only that thought comes from selection of certain aspects of perceptual matter. Physical objects would not then be mere symbols of perceptual objects, but arrived at by this selective process, which makes science artificial or artistic, to which is superadded the extreme freedom of the mind in manipulating its thoughts by the help of instrumental methods which it chooses. It does not seem true that the elements of the basal structure, relata and relations, have no analogue in familiar experience; on the contrary, they are the extremest abstractions or selections from that experience. But it is true that in handling these concepts the mind goes beyond anything found in perception, not inventing new material, but combining its store of material in ways suited to its own purposes. In the end it seems that the physical reconstruction of things from above, if understood as a pure creation of the mind, implies that old contrast of familiar experience and things in them? selves which has been so profound a difficulty in philosophy since it was formulated by Kant. It is, however, beyond my scope to discuss the attempts made since his time to remove those difficulties and banish the spectre now apparently revived. On the other hand, the difficulties do not arise, and the spectre remains laid, so long as the new way of approaching the world from its most abstract characters is regarded as a method of rewriting the objective or given world, of which experimental physics writes the record approaching it from the concrete side. The alleged truisms then take their place as the record of the highest abstractions which we can make in our selec? tion from Nature. Whether the atomicity of Nature, supposed to be 348</page><page sequence="19">SCIENCE AND ART as yet recalcitrant to mind, shall remain so or be regarded as funda? mental laws of basic structure, will depend on whether it is found possible, as in the case of a number or constant curvature, to find concepts from which certain and unavoidable consequences follow so long as these concepts remain integral to the world. This being so, it is illegitimate to suppose a chasm between the brute facts of physical nature as presented in sensible experience of particulars and the most abstract principles; and data of sense are a part of the body of physical science, just as they are in the his? torical sciences. Facts and principles make up a single system, the facts being massed together for the most part in the form of empirical laws. The rationalized and consequently deductive portion of the sciences is never completely detached from the irrational element, which may always contain surprises. The slave never rises completely out of the block. If it did, science would be a fine art, as I have already said. Accordingly it is not so much intrusion of the mind which characterizes science at its highest remove as the rationaliza? tion of the subject-matter more and more by means of the mind. The physical sciences have exhibited not only the freedom of the mind in selection from its material and in invention of constructions such as those illustrated from world-building, but also the limitation or control of the mind by its subject-matter. The first feature likens physics to an art, the second unlikens it to fine art. When we come to mathematics we find the mind's freedom at its highest, and par? ticularly in pure mathematics, where, starting from the integers, the mind has, by successive stages, constructed whole creations of its own in which there seems to be complete emancipation from any control by reality of a non-mental character. No one would subscribe at present to the Kantian doctrine, that mathematics derive their validity from their applicability to sensible experience. Here in these constructions the mind claims for itself complete freedom to follow its own will; and this science might claim for itself to be wholly an art. Examples are the arithmetic, which includes not only zero and fractions but negative numbers, the real numbers and imaginary numbers; the idea of systems of fewer or more than three dimensions, or to describe them generally w-dimensional systems; the mathe? matical theories of infinity and continuity; the transfinite numbers. The constructions thus made seem to be self-contained, and they have upon the mind an effect very like the aesthetic impression. And yet even these works differ from works of art, though for a different reason. We denied to the other sciences the claim of being fine art because they were controlled by their subject-matter from the out? side. Here, while the outside element seems to be wanting, the product fails to be fine art, because the material is itself the mind's 349</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES own creation, whereas fine art is always the informing by the mind of a material of sense or imagery given to the mind. Even so the extent of the mind's creativeness in the unbounded freedom of pure mathematics is to be qualified. The products it creates are extensions or generalizations of ideas like integral num? bers given to the mind or arrived at by combinations of such ideas, as, for example, the notion of five-dimensional systems. It may be doubted if the mind creates a single new quality, as it would if it were true that it could, acting upon its own idea of permanence, invent, e.g., the idea of another self distinct from its own. However complex the thought may be, it is, if not suggested by sense, yet derived from elements suggested in the end by sense. The difference may be illustrated from a famous passage of Hume, who, after denying that we could have ideas without preceding impressions, admitted that this was possible in the rare case where we imagined a quality in a scale, say of colours or tones, intermediate between two given colours or tones without any previous impression of the intermediate. Hume is probably mistaken,1 and confuses the thought of an intermediate colour which we can well create on the ground of analogy and the actual image of such a colour, to be acquainted with which we should need to experiment, as the painter doubtless does mixing his paints until he finds the satisfying shade. Perhaps the best way to understand the unlimited freedom of the mind to follow its own bent in these creations of whole regions of scientific thought, in the creation, for instance, of a calculus, is to remember that all science is but practice become disinterested. Curiosity, which begins by being practical, the research of gratifica- tions as in a dog, ends by being theoretical and is then science. In practical curiosity the end is sometimes interrupted by the need of finding means to secure the end. Now the sciences, in working out the implications of ideas which mind itself creates in the qualified sense just explained, may be properly regarded as departments of mental technique. The mind follows in such elaboration its own laws of implication or inference. And yet even in these regions there is not complete separation of the mind from what is non-mental (I remind you of Mr. Russell's famous saying that "mathematics is the science in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we say is true"). For pure arithmetic coheres with its basal elements given in whole numbers, and created according to Kronecker by God and not by man. It takes us far away from integers, and never loses touch of 1 I have, however, to observe that Mr. Whitehead in Process and Reality not only accepts Hume's admission as true, but takes it as an instance of a fundamental principle. But I leave the text, written before I knew Mr. Whitehead's book, unaltered. 350</page><page sequence="21">SCIENCE AND ART them completely. This is true even when arithmetic is submitted to a still further process of sublimation and becomes a piece of logic, when an integer is treated as a class of classes. For though a class is a mental conception, and there are no classes in actual reality, yet reality does contain individuals which, though not mental, suffer themselves to be so grouped because they possess the same qualities. The connection of mathematics with sensible reality, though we cannot speak of control from that side, is plain in geometry, which cannot now be treated as pure mathematics, but since the super- session of space and time by space-time has become a kind of physical science. And though the validity of mathematics does not depend on verification in sense-experience as Kant thought, yet the signal triumphs won in physics, as recently in the doctrine of gravitation, through application of mathematical techniques devised without any ulteri or purpose than the deduction of implications from the premises with which they start, are enough to show that the minds of mathematicians in their extreme cult of the useless are guided by some divination of the useful. This is not so strange. We are back again at the fact that minds are themselves a part of nature and made by adaptation to the rest; and if in following their nature they devise thoughts to which nothing in nature directly corresponds, their freedom or wildness has its roots in Nature itself. It would seem then that, though free from limitation by the non- mental, even pure mathematics is remotely correspondent to Nature, and still less remotely connected with the whole numbers, which, if not sensible things, are at any rate not made by mind. This may seem and is a long circuit to have fetched in order to establish what is at first sight a fairly obvious and simple result: that in science the work of the mind, however free, is controlled by what it sets out to investigate. It was, however, necessary, because it had against it a tendency to attribute an overpowering and constitutive part in science to the mind. The real upshot of the dis? cussion is to show first that science is dependent on the mind, so that without mind there would be no science, but we should be confronted by a real world which we did not understand. So far as this is so, as science proceeds by selection from its subject and elaboration by its own tools, which may be of the greatest abstract- ness, it creates a body of truth which is more than reality, and is reality as elaborated by the mind and become its possession. So far science is an art. But in this elaboration of its material, the mind introduces no ideas of its own in the sense of being its own creation. The function of the mindin science is instrumental, to construct its work in obedience to and, as I have so often phrased it, under the control of the non-mental material. The mind does, of course, intro- 351</page><page sequence="22">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES duce ideas from itself into the body of the science, in so far as it brings the riches of its experience of the subject or kindred subjects to bear upon the interpretation, orinvents hypotheses. But all such introduced ideas are congenial to the subject, and not, like the life introduced by the sculptor into the marble, uncongenial to the material on which the artist operates. Consequently, directly or indirectly, immediately or remotely, the ideas which the scientific material admits are found in it and verified by it. So that there enters into every science, as there entered into historical and quasi- historical science, the mass of particular facts with which the science begins and which it retains to the end. The mind establishes coher? ence amongst the facts of perception by means of laws obtained through selection and reflection. The mere laws of the science, except so far as empirical laws sum up the experience of particulars, do not themselves constitute a self-contained and harmonious whole. The raw material, whether presented in perception or in thought (as in the facts of quanta) is carried into the product, only organized and rearranged. It is true that in the various branches of mathe? matics the science itself forms a self-contained whole, but then the material is itself supplied by the mind itself and simply worked up by logical methods. It has been my object at once to point out the artistry of science and to indicate where science differs from fine art. It may be useful in conclusion to add to this impression of artistry made by science by comparing the mind's own use of its logical methods, inference and the like, to the technique of the artist. Logic in the ordinary sense is then the science of scientific technique, and the special logical methods of different sciences are comparable to the special technique ofthe artist according as he works in stone, or words, or paints, and the like. I do not quite see what corresponds in science to what is called style in a fine art, which is a function of technique. Such comparisons are perhaps apt to mislead. For the difference of artistic technique and logical technique is fundamental. The tech? nique of the artist gives meaning to the artistic product. The tech? nique of the scientist does not enter into the very constitution of the work, but remains purely instrumental. 352</page></plain_text>
