The report, based on a two and a half-year study, immediately came under attack from the usual opponents of birth control. Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, always ready to call a spade a shovel, said the proposed birth-control clinics would be a "dumb idea" and would "damage our schools and children. I'm sure this group had good inten- tions. I just wish it had more wisdom and common sense." Perhaps the Council would wish Bennett the same. (Widely reported, but the Dec. 17 Education Week is an especially good source.) Classics in the School "It is argued that since young pupils will read popular literature anyway, we ought to teach the classics in school because otherwise they will never know anything about them. I do not say that the argument lacks merit; but it has an ugly aspect, when stripped of its sophistry. It amounts to admitting that because the classics are disagreeable anyway, we had better teach them in school along with the other disagreeable subjects. Moreover, it invalidates the very assumptions on which the teaching of the classics is based; the assumptions, namely, that their teaching will carry over into life .... It reduces literature to a more or less disagreeable task to be conscientiously got through for some mysterious reason that neither teacher nor pupil can understand. It makes the teacher admit defeat before the battle is begun." Howard Mumford Jones, "The Fetish of the Classics," March 1929 EnglishJournal. Two Books about Different Kinds of Dogs, Both Highly Recommended Boswell: The English Experiment, 1785-1789 (ed. Irma S. Lustig and Frederick A. Pottle, McGraw-Hill) continues the lusty and bumbling tale of Boswell's search for what he might do if he ever grew up. Sexy reading/ scholarship for all English teachers. J. R. Ackerley's My Dog Tulip: Life with an Alsatian (Poseidon Press) is far afield from Boswell, but the story of a long-time literary editor of The Listener (a great English magazine) who came late to the world of dogs is delightful (and it's not one of those cutesy anthropomorphic things). Nancy Reagan Take Note-Drugs in the Schools in 1927 "Regarded as a drug and used with moderation reading can be almost innocuous .., .but the habit once formed grows very rapidly and the temp- tation to excess is very great. Immoderate readers find great enjoyment in the indulgence and declare that it opens new and strange worlds to them, that it inspires them, urges them to the performance of great actions, makes them forget their sorrows and so on. Opium-eaters and those who are addicted to hashish say much the same thing, but they are not so 14 English Journal</page><page sequence="2">blatant about it. Those who soak themselves in books have no shame- they will even make a boast of their weakness." Mrs. Desmond O'Brien, "The Pernicious Habit of Reading." The Parents' Review: A Monthly Maga- zine for Parents and Teachers, March 1927 (published in London). How to Get into Trouble by Really Trying A story by Bruce Buursma in the Chicago Tribune (and reprinted in the Nov. 22 Arizona Republic) tells of the Rev. George Martin, a Minneapolis Episcopal priest, whose award-winning ad crusades about religion have won him some fans and a number of detractors. In the ads, half-pictorial with brief messages above, Martin announced, "The Episcopal Church welcomes you. Regardless of race, creed, color or the number of times you've been born" and "Unfortunately, you can't meet God's gift to women in a singles' bar." My two favorites-and it's easy to see why some narrow-minded folk might have been irked-"There's only one problem with religions that have all the answers. They don't allow questions" and "He died to take away your sins. Not your mind." Back in the Good Old Days When Spiritual Matters Counted and Young People Had a Purpose in Life. "No one can teach in our universities without being shocked at the pov- erty of the students in what, for want of a better term, must be called 'spiritual' matters. They have been accumulating facts for years without any basic attitude toward life to which to relate them. The ethical core is lacking from their education. They are aimless and materialistic and have no guiding principles, either aesthetic or ethical, and no stabilizing central purpose. To support them in adversity they have only a shallow sophisti- cation. Yet this is the generation which must deal with what promises to be one of the crucial hours of civilization!" Bergen Evans, "English and Ethics," EnglishJournal for Sept. 1935. The Holocaust and Its Literature If you're interested in books about the Holocaust (and who isn't?), read Irving Howe's "Writing and the Holocaust" in the Oct. 27 New Republic, a good review of what's been written and what needs yet to be said. And while you're doing that, reread Elie Wiesel's Nobel Peace Prize speech in the Dec. 11 New York Times. Saving Youth for Fun and Profit "I am rather troubled about the moral fibre of this censor who reads the subversive books ... if the book has no effect on that censor, why should it have any effect on me? I insist that my moral fibre is just as strong as his, and I insist that freedom, if it means anything, means that I have a right to be contaminated. Who are these people who arrogate to them- selves the right to be contaminated, but deny it to me?...For whom is this restricting done?...I assume it would probably be applied to youth. Our censors are always saving youth. It does not strike me that middle-age and old-age have made tremendous success of the world as it is; and my own experience is that youth has a certain self-restraint and idealism, and that as you get older you become a little more cynical. If there is any crowd that needs saving, it is middle-age and old-age, and not youth." Arthur Garfield Hays, "Should Libraries Restrict the Use of Subversive Publica- tions?" August 1940 ALA Bulletin. A Final Plea to Start Subscribing to Discover I've yet to read an issue of Discover without finding fascinating stuff, much of it usable with classes. Frederic Golden's "A Man with Titantic Vision" in January is about Bob Ballard, the Scientist who discovered and filmed the resting place of the Titanic. But while you're reading that, note also Stephen Jay Gould's essay, "Darwinism Defined." There may be better science writers than Gould but where are they? What Is the Function of a Public Library? "I believe most everyone would agree that the public library has two func- tions: to educate, to entertain. As far as I know nothing has ever been written in any act of incorporation of any library that even suggests that the third function of the library is to act as a guardian of the people's morals." Elizabeth Butterfield, "Is the Public Library Its Brother's Keeper?" Wilson Library Bulletin, June 1943. April 1987 15</page></plain_text>
