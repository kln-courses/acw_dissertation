<plain_text><page sequence="1">Masks and Headgear of Native American Ritual/Theatre on the Northwest Coast Janet Snyder Neil There has been theatre in North America for hundreds of years. The range of ceremonies and performance events is as vast and varied as the hundreds of languages native to the continent. This vast range of performances may be the reason theatre scholars have not yet established the different genres of Native American Theatre as they have those of European and Asian theatre forms. Folk puppets, grand opera, realistic drama, and temple dances have been organized as varieties of theatrical tradi- tions, while Native American performances have been relatively overlooked by theatre historians. Without the guidelines of such genres, this article will approach the Native American theatre/rituals by focussing on the masks and headgear made for performance by the Northwest Coast Indian people. This headgear ranges from war helmets to shamans' masks. It communicates significant ideas about social status and prestige through the performer's intentions, from the presentation of Self to the transformation into an Other. The area of Northwest Coast culture includes the coastal and river-dwelling people who lived from Yakutat Bay in Southern Alaska to the Columbia River that forms the border of Washington and Oregon. From this vast area, I have selected only humanoid facial masks and headgear made and used during the nineteenth century by the three most northern language groups of the Northwest Coast, the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian people. The performance traditions and cultural systems of these three neighboring groups are more similar in detail to each other than they are to the people of the central and southern parts of the Coast. Each of the language groups (often termed "tribes") was organized into strictly exogamic divisions or moieties. In addi- tion, the organization of family, house, and town was by hierarchal clans. Power and wealth were concentrated in the hereditary aristocracy of the clans. The nobility was required to sponsor the social ceremonial performances that were validated by pot- latches. Commoners within the clans supported the aristocarcy's activities and valued the prestige they garnered from their lineage. A third level of the social structure was filled by slaves obtained through war raids. Slaves held no rank in the social structure and retained their original tribal identities.'

The head of the family controlled the use and distribution of these privileges among its members. These privileges arose from the ownership of family history and included rights to nearly all aspects of society: the display of crest images, use of songs and performance of dances, use of names (which were changed several times during life), location of houses, food gathering jurisdiction, types of clothing, property, canoes, houses, and so on. In the northern part of the coast, these privileges were inherited matrilineally; though some might be acquired as a gift, through marriage, or as spoils of war. The display of hereditary rights was central to the functioning of the social system. The rights to ownership existed only as confirmed by spectators of performance events. These groups had no written language. Instead, they developed a central oral tradition as well as a complex system of communication composed in part by visual symbols. Thus, visual arts were considered props or relics of the oral presentation or dramatic performance for which they were conceived. Their presence in the everyday life of the village confirmed the social status of their owners. The performances on the Northwest Coast were social rather than religious events, though supernatural beings from the Myth Time might be involved. The head of a family sponsored his clan's social ceremonies by inviting all the ranking members of the opposite clans to a performance event. At these carefully ordered events, crests and privileges were displayed. The host narrated his family history dramatized through songs and dances, costumes, makeup, and stagecraft. All of the crest images used in masks, clothing, sculpture, and painting were drawn from family history. They illustrated a complex series of stories that revealed various aspects of the family's development. Some depicted the interaction of the ancestors with the supernatural. Others represented characters such as a personal spirit helper. Such helpers aided practical skills such as hunting or carving. These spirit helpers could have appeared as personal crest figures, later becoming assimilated as part of the family's wealth, or might have remained the property of an individual. Social performances and feasts were required to mark Life Crisis events such as naming, coming of age, ascendancy of a chief, mourning, and pole or house raising.2 The guests feasted throughout the festivities. Enormous amounts of food and gifts were distributed by the host at the conclusion of the celebration. These donations were accompanied by formal speeches in a ceremony called the potlatch. The potlatch always accompanied any performance or demonstration of hereditary rights. By ac- cepting these gifts, the guests acknowledged and affirmed the host's right to the privileges claimed. Unless privileges were validated by the acceptance of significant gifts in a potlatch, the wealth of the clan could have been lost and its prestige diminished. These performance events could require years of preparation, particularly since a great deal of wealth had to be accumulated for distribution in order to ap- propriately honor the lineage and add to its prestige. Costumes, masks, and dances were refurbished and dazzling new features were prepared. 2Aurel Krause, The Tlingit Indians, trans. Erna Gunther (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1956), p. 162.</page><page sequence="3">455 / NATIVE AMERICAN RITUAL/THEATRE The heroic ancestors and a pantheon of supernatural beings were revealed through a distinct and finite vocabulary of forms. Any attempt to locate an order in this vari- ety, and to understand the essence of the masks must first recognize the culture's im- portant system of lineage and hereditary privilege represented by family crests. Crests appeared in the artwork as animals, abstract designs, and as human faces. They were represented on helmets and as designs on portrait masks. Human faces were decorated with social status symbols using labrets, tatoos, and paints. Crests were depicted on clan hats and on the frontlets of dancing headdresses. Faces were sculpted on visor masks, face-masks, transformation masks, and on shamans' masks and their other paraphernalia. Rank and identity were the primary issue in traditional society on the Northern Coast. To a great extent, wealth was measured by and proceeded from the prestige obtained through performance events and potlatches. Prestige was represented by temporal wealth as well as by connections with powers greater than ordinary human beings. Mask and Meaning Masks are the means by which the supernatural world is made visible. They may repre- sent powerful spirit helpers whose potency infuses a shaman or dramatic manifestations of fabled creatures of family history.3 Until very recently, Richard Schechner has focused much of his work in Perform- ance Theory about non-western theatre in Asia and the South Pacific. Schechner's model also applies to Native American performance. In Ritual, Play, and Perform- ance, Schechner proposed a general theory of performance as a binary system, in which performance is located between "efficacy-ritual" and "entertainment-theatre": The basic opposition is between efficacy and entertainment, not between ritual and theatre. Whether one calls a specific performance ritual or theatre depends on the degree to which performance tends toward efficacy or entertainment.4 Borrowing this notion from Schechner, I propose another binary system that exam- ines the individual performer's intention in selecting masks or headgear for perform- ance. This binary system permits an analysis of the forms of Native American Theatre through performance paraphernalia. The oppositions in this binary system are the presentation of the Self and the transformation into an Other. In this system the "Self" is the individual human being and the "Other" is a distinct character who does not represent the individual behind the mask. This Other may represent the identity of an entire lineage, a supernatural spirit helper, or a character from an episode of family history. The theatricality of masks and headgear in performance may be determined using this Self-Other binary system. The purpose of such a scale is to facilitate an understanding of masks as part of a way of seeing, communicating, and defining rela- tionships with men and the supernatural. 3 Bill Holm, The Box of Daylight, Northwest Coast Indian Art (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1983), p. 33. 4 Richard Schechner, "From Ritual to Theatre and Back," in Ritual, Play, and Performance, ed. Richard Schechner and Mady Schuman (New York: The Seabury Press, 1976), p. 207.</page><page sequence="4">456 / TI, December 1986 The masks and crest images can be located on a continuum that runs from the presentation of the Self to the evocation of, even transformation to, the Other, in- cluding the conscious simultaneous presentation of Self and Other and a state of double disguise. The performance of Self and Other presumes that there is an audience and that the performer is more or less self-consciously an actor. The actor begins as the unselfconscious, personal Self. Next s/he takes on the social Self, that everyday Self who performs and intentionally communicates information in a social performance context. Thirdly, there is the theatrical Self who assumes the identity of the Other in performance. In other words, the Self and Other combine to produce a character. In Northwest Coast performances there existed a Double Characterization. For example, an actor played the role of an initiant who had also been transformed into a supernatural being. Beyond traditional characterization, the shaman could be completely transformed into an other when he embodies one of his supernatural helpers.5 Northwest Coast Indian masks and headgear are well-represented in museum col- lections. They may be exhibited as artwork, as curiousities, or as part of anthro- pological dioramas. One goal of the proposed continuum is to provide an approach for the classification of these primary sources. In a few major collections there are some masklike carvings that were created for a non-ceremonial performance context. Among the most striking human-scale carvings, these appear to be pyramidal sculpted heads. These masklike hats are helmets that were used with defensive clothing that is similar in construction to ancient Asian suits of armor. In the late eighteenth century, at the beginning of the Historic period, the use of armor was general among Native North Americans. On the Northwest Coast, normal body proportions were elongated with the addition of a hardwood helmet carved to represent a powerful, oversized head. Below this, a heavy wooden visor covered the face, with a rod-and-slat vest or cuirass, with greaves and similar protection for the upper legs and arms. The rectangular panels left free of twining at front and back of the cuirass were typically painted with crest designs analogous to the insignia worn by European knights or the Mon of the Japanese samurai. They proclaimed the identity of the warrior who was hidden by his helmet and visor.6 The helmet and suit of armor, while covering the body, did not conceal the identity of the wearer. The crests refer to ancestral rights in the same way that the surname refers to family heritage in dominant Western Culture. These designs identify the in- dividual and come closer to the category of a pure presentation of the Self through masking than most other Northwest Coast artworks. 5 See Aldona Jonaitis, "Sacred Art and Spiritual Power: An Analysis of Tlingit Shaman's Masks," in Native North American Art History, ed. Z. P. Mathews and A. Jonaitis (Palo Alto: Peek Publications, 1982). 6 Bill Holm and Thomas Vaughn, Soft Gold, The Fur Trade and Cultural Exchange on the Northwest Coast of America (Portland: Oregon Historical Society, 1982), p. 83.</page><page sequence="5">457 / NATIVE AMERICAN RITUAL/THEATRE In the 1780s the wearing of helmet and armor connoted several meanings; the gar- ment was worn as protection in serious combat, but the performative choices were to dazzle, terrify, overwhelm the opponent and to glorify the Self as an individual. With the introduction of gunpowder and ballshot by the Russian explorers at the end of the eighteenth century, armor ceased to be effective in war and the wearing of armor took on a purely ceremonial status. Portrait masks reveal the practices of face painting, tattooing, and the use of labrets. The direct application of pigment to the skin, whether as paint or tatoo, im- poses shorthand crest designs upon the individual's face. The individual Self remains present while the presentation of an Other, the family lineage, is created by skin decoration. Boas records meaning for facial and body painting, but he and other nineteenth-century field workers frequently differ in their interpretation of the abstract designs.7 The Haida developed tatooing into a fine art. Until the late nineteenth century, men and women were tatooed with elaborate crest designs on chest, arms, legs, feet, sometimes on the back of the shoulders, and the face. Because most people wore European-style clothing after 1850, these tatoos would usually be seen only on those occasions at which family prerogatives were displayed, such as feasts and potlatches. The Tlingit employed paint instead of tatooing for facial crest designs. Until at least the 1880s, women of rank wore a labret in a slit cut in the lower lip as a symbol of maturity. The incision was made during a ceremony in childhood or at puberty. This facial decoration offered a presentation of Self as a social status. Slaves were not allowed to wear the labret. Women were as embarassed when asked to remove the labret as a European woman might be if asked to bare her breasts. Tatooing and labrets were marks made at significant moments in one's life such as puberty, marriage, and changes in rank. They signified rank and privilege, worn as a badge of social status. In this sense everyday life became performance. There is further evidence to support this notion that signs of social status appeared throughout every- day life. House screens, house posts, monumental sculpture, fishing hooks, canoes, and many everyday household items were decorated with lineage crests. Faces were regularly protected with greasepaint against insects and the glare of the sun on water and snow. The painting or printing of crest patterns, or designs on the skin, appears to have been reserved for special ceremonies and performance events. Behavior and clothing for the great feasts and potlatches given for Life Crisis events on the Northwest Coast were formal and codified. Among the northern peoples, these events concerned the family of the host in such events as mourning the dead or the in- stallation of new leaders. They were also means by which children and adolescents were introduced to a full understanding of traditional life.8 One of the most dignified and imaginative pieces of regalia used in the social ceremonials of the Northwest Coast Indians [is the frontlet headdress]. Combining colorful materials 7Franz Boas, Primitive Art (New York: Dover Publications, 1955), p. 191. 8J. C. H. King, Portrait Masks from the Northwest Coast of America (London: Thames and Hudson, 1979), p. 18.</page><page sequence="6">458 / T, December 1986 with the finest wood carving, these headdresses draw on the family crest myths for their symbolism. Though referred to in the literature as 'chief's headdress,' the term chief is loosely used. [A number of ranking elders might wear these headdresses at a particular social event. When traded in the nineteenth century to the southern part of the Coast, these headdresses became part of initiation society paraphernalia.] These were status symbols, however, and the crest indicated the wearer's clan affiliation.9 The frontlet was usually an elaborately carved vertical wood panel attached to a framework of wood or baleen covered with swanskin, crowned with flicker feathers, eagledown, and sea lion whiskers, to which a train of ermine skins four to five feet long was attached. In museum collections many frontlets have been separated from the rest of the headdress, obscuring their original function in performance. "There is a great variety in the subjects portrayed on these frontlets, since they seldom draw on the principal clan symbols but rather seek out characters from the minor episodes of clan myths."'10 The wearer self-consciously enhanced the image of the Self using his or her lineage, crest figures, and the prestige of the trade goods incorporated into the headdress. Im- ported goods such as California blue abalone, copper, calico or cotton sacking, and ermine skins served to indicate the wealth and power of the individual. The headdress created a sense of personal power. It was at once a crown, a costume that wrapped around the dancer, and a social, even political, statement. The audience recognized the power of the complex image of the individual, family lineage and wealth. The dramatic carving, reflective copper, irridescent abalone inlays, brilliant white eagledown, and ermine combined to create an especially stunning effect in the hazy, fire-lit performance space for which it was designed. The clan hat was the most prestigious item of ceremonial regalia. This headdress, worn by the head of the family at social ceremonies, ranged from a finely-woven spruce root hat painted with crest designs to a carved figurative helmet much like the war helmet. The hat represented both the ancestors and the living family members. It elevated the performer to the most prestigious rank possible through an historic con- nection to supernatural beings of the Myth Time. The performer presented Self and Other simultaneously. Clearly theatrical masks appeared in the dances performed at social ceremonies and initiation society rituals. The visor masks, transformation masks, and face masks of these events can be interpreted as a characterization of an Other for audience. A visor mask was worn on the top of the head, no lower than the forehead; the dancer looked out from below the mask. These masks were frequently articulated and the movement of snapping jaws, rolling eyes, and various animated parts were controlled by strings. The elaborate "transformation" masks incorporated multiple characterizations into a single, compound mask. The moment of transformation was coordinated with accom- panying songs. A transformation mask embodied the historic incidents articulated in the song and demonstrated the privileges of the clan that owned the right to perform with this style of mask. These masks concealed the dancer's head and face. Much of 9 Erna Gunther, The Chief's Headdress (Portland: Portland Art Museum, 1963), p. 3. 10 Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">459 / NATIVE AMERICAN RITUAL/THEATRE the dancer's body was also concealed by trailers of fur, cloth, leather, or shredded bark. The dancer's movements were related directly to the character portrayed, and the quality of the performance was judged largely on the faithfulness and the imagina- tive interpretation of the character's actions." The Other was most fully illustrated through these masks and costumes, rendering the performance self-consciously theatrical. In many dramatic performances the masked dancers were even profes- sionals, paid by the host to perform the family's dances. The Double Disguise occurred during performances involving initiation society rituals. These dancing societies included members from all clans, though the right to be initiated might be an hereditary prerogative. The initiation rite extended over as many as a dozen years and was undertaken in stages during the winter season. The initiation society rituals involved the performance of dances by the initiant, inspired by his or her close association with supernatural powers. This initiation performance took place during several days' events, incorporating the stages of inspiration and the taming of the inspired apprentice by experienced attendants. The primary dancer was taken away by attendants and returned immediately in the guise of the supernatural. In practice, the dancer who exited was replaced by a paid masked dancer who was "waiting in the wings." This actor impersonated the initiant as one transformed into a supernatural human being. This Double Disguise of the actor playing the initiant transformed into the supernatural performed several functions: it illustrated the hereditary privilege of the initiant, dramatized the spiritual state of the initiant, and entertained the audience whose presence and approval was required to validate the privilege. Thomas McIlwraith described such dramatic subterfuge in the kusiut Cannibal ini- tiation society dance of the Kimsquit Bella Coola. A grotesque prop graphically illus- trated the taming of a Cannibal dancer. In the "curing" performance, the head of an eagle, wolf, or bear suddenly appeared beside the kusiut dancer. The head had been constructed so it could open its mouth, move its eyes, and give other signs of life. This was the kusiut's cannibalisitic incubus, implanted in him by his patron Atqutiim, SExsExkiilaix, or Kiimaits, and driven out by the drumming of the kukusiut at- tendants. The assumption is that [the kusiut] has had the nature and instincts of an animal enter into him. If this cannibalistic incubus can be driven out by beating time, he will be restored to sanity. ... The incubus vomits pieces of meat, presumably the pieces of human flesh 11The success of the actor's transformation is determined in part by the audience's grasp of conven- tions, in part by the scenography, but in large part by the skills of the actor. Through careful analyses of filmed and live performances the theatre scholar can discern the essential characteristics that distinguish a performer. Examples of great Northwest Coast actors recorded on film include the Grizzly Bear dancer in the Curtis film, "In the Land of the War Canoes" (1914). This is a European-style scripted production with Native people acting both in the European tradition and in the Native mode. The Grizzly Bear dancer's brilliant characterization is shown only too briefly. Another great Kwakiutl artist recorded on film is the late Joe Seaweed.

Curtis in the Land of the War Canoes, A Pioneer Cinematographer in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1980).</page><page sequence="8">460 / TI, December 1986 which [the kusiut] has devoured; in reality they are morsels passed into the back of the head by the carpenters, concealed behind the row of kukusiut assistants.12 After a series of shouts and choreographed movements, the head disappeared (to the realm of the supernatural) and the kusiut was tolerably sane. The masks used by northern Northwest Coast shamans involved more than the characterization of the Other, they served as catalysts for transformation. Shamans were individuals in the culture who maintained closer contact with the supernatural than did ordinary people. They held clan rank and participated as members of society (in many cases the position was hereditary). Their appearance was markedly different from ordinary people. The shaman's responsibility was threefold: to bring good for- tune (in hunting, fishing, war, weather, etc.) to the village; to act as a healer; and to identify witches, (those who had brought evil to the community). The shamans on the northern coast had many elements in common with "classical" shamanism, but their role was not as central to the organization of the society as those of the Coast Salish, on the southern coast. The costumes and paraphernalia of the Tlingit and Tsimshian shaman have many parallels with the elaborate costume of other transpolar shamans. Their paraphernalia reveals the shaman's journey to supernatural realms. Thus, the images can be more grotesque and distorted than other Northwest Coast artworks. Distortion of form may have served to express the emotional content of the trance state. The shaman used masks in a theatrical way to make his power more visible for his audience. Yet because the shaman's mask resembled a spirit, the mask itself had power. It was inhabited by the supernatural helper who infused the shaman with power. The native people considered the shaman's paraphernalia to be inherently po- tent and dangerous. Shamans and their equipment were buried away from the village (and other graves) on a site that could be avoided. For this reason, North American museums have remarkable collections of shaman's paraphernalia, "collected" by non- believers who held no fear of the traditional powers of the objects. In the late nineteenth century, Lt. George Emmons collected a number of Tlingit shamans' kits for the Field Museum in Chicago. Such a kit includes elements of costume, charms, power bundles, and other paraphernalia, including masks repre- senting the shaman's yek, or spirit helpers. Masks depict a wide variety of zoomorphic yek, such as land otters, devilfish or octopus, hawks, ravens, wolves, and Kingfishers, as well as anthropomorphic yek such as angry men, peacemakers, chiefs, old men and young women. Understanding the meaning and function of a single mask presents no problem: each represents one of the shaman's spirit assistants which can assume the form of either a human or an animal. During a healing ceremony or power-displaying ritual, the shaman puts on a mask and turns into that yek, behaving like a bird, wolf, a young woman, or an angry man, depending on the identity of the spirit on the mask. The Tlingit shaman, however, does not wear just one mask at these ceremonies, for he owns a set of several masks, and wears them in a series.13 12 Thomas F. McIlwraith, The Bella Coola Indians (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1948), II, pp. 78-79. 13 Jonaitis, "Sacred Art," p. 119.</page><page sequence="9">461 / NATIVE AMERICAN RITUAL/THEATRE In her extensive study of Tlingit shaman's paraphernalia, Aldona Jonaitis points out that the donning of specific masks in a series distanced the shaman from his commu- nity. He risked becoming a stranger in his group in order to combat malevolent forces. The shaman began as a member of profane society and, in sequence, actually transformed himself into complementary beings. During this process, the shaman effectively disregards all the rules of social order which govern his group. .... He blurs the distinctions - so crucial to profane order - between complements.... As the shaman dons more and more of these masks, he successively obscures the distinctions and definitions that are the foundations of profane existence. As he distances himself from social structure, he becomes more and more a member of the antithetical realm of the sacred and acquires as a consequence more and more of the super- natural efficacy it embodies. It is thus the process of donning a series of masks which are organized into complementary subsets that confer spiritual power upon this shaman.14 The Supernatural was made present through the interaction of shaman and masks. This supernatural Other required the corporal being of the shaman in order to emerge in the profane world. The shaman may have begun as an actor but eventually served as a vehicle for the transformation. When the shaman removed the mask, the con- tinuum was brought full circle: the individual reemerged as the Self and the dazzling transformation to the Other ended. There has been a renaissance of Northwest Coast Indian art and performance since the 1951 repeal of the ban on Indian performance and potlatch. Audrey Hawthorn describes the ban and its impact: In 1884, as a result of the disapproval of missionaries and government officials, the potlatch was made illegal. In spite of the prohibition, however, the potlatch was so inter- woven with the purpose and meaning of Kwakiutl life that it continued, although away from the main centers. In 1921 ... the police sent a contingent to interrupt the potlatch of Daniel Cranner of Alert Bay. Several participants were imprisoned, and the masks and coppers of the host were taken to the National Museum. Since potlatching was an inherent sanction of so many important transfers and relation- ships, its discontinuance made coherent tribal life impossible. In 1951 the ban on potlatch- ing was repealed and the institution, which had operated under cover but in a diminished way, took on new vigor.15 In recent years small regional museums have been established in communities like Cape Mudge and Alert Bay and some of the confiscated and "collected" materials are being returned to their owners. Art schools have been established by the Gitksan (Tsimshian) in British Columbia and by the Tlingit in Alaska. Public performance troupes have been formed by Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, and elsewhere. At the same time, community and private performances have survived despite legal restrictions. Whether performances are professional or private, the actors who take the risk of stepping into the spotlight are cast in the mold of their legendary ancestors who in- augurated performances on the Northwest Coast. Today the performances still serve to strengthen the collective and affirm the self-worth of the people. The impact of the 14 Ibid., p. 132. 15 Audrey Hawthorn, Kwakiutl Art (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1979), p. 34.</page><page sequence="10">462 / TJ, December 1986 ban in some regions was the loss of traditional songs, dances, and performance cycles. Among these groups, new categories are emerging for Native American performance. In other places, non-Indians have helped to reconstitute a kind of ethnic folkdance. They help to reconstruct performances from data found in anthropological films, recordings, and texts. In yet other locations, traditional performances are being re- vived by people who preserve contact with their traditions while they participate in mainstream Western culture. Performances may include narration in order to serve educational as well as entertainment purposes. This revitalization of performance on the Northwest Coast indicates the continuing commitment to theatrical performance among Native Americans. The Native American artifacts of the Northwest Coast, long considered as examples of the fine arts, continue to serve as elements of per- formance.</page></plain_text>
