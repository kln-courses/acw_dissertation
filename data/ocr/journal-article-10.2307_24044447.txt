The book substitutes fully compares with one of Wordsworth's poems of encoun- for the brother's absent body in a pietà that is the more mov ter, but the subtitle also recalls one of Wordsworth's most ing because so humdrum and domesticated, famous lines, "With rocks and stones and trees." The essays collected in this book, like the poem that this line concludes, Jacobus's désoeuvrement is in some chapters very intri reflect on the relationship between the world of things and cate. The second, "Pastoral, after History: The Apple the world of thought. But the world of things is understood Orchard," begins with Seamus Heaney's translation of the so broadly (Jacobus understands translation, history and lyric poem by Rilke that supplies Jacobus's subtitle, goes on to in poetry itself as things, no less than rocks and stones) that it vestigate the literary and personal relationship between W.

They do, however, share a critical manner, perhaps Richter's series of landscapes, Apple Trees, in which a single, best described by a term that Jacobus borrows from Blanchot, banal German landscape is progressively blurred until it has désoeuvrement, "a restless unworking that refuses totalization all but dissolved.

The fifth chapter, for exam- which he recalls the Devonshire apples from a tree grown pie, brings together "Distressful gift!," the poem that Words- from a pip given him by Hughes. It is a chapter that figures worth inscribed, after his brother's death, in the volume of the poems as the harvest of the poet's talent, and a chapter manuscript poems that had been intended to accompany his that explores how poems are produced by a process of graft brother on his voyages, with "By Force of Mourning," the es- ing. Heaney produces "The Apple Orchard" by grafting onto say in which Derrida commemorates his friendship with the stock of Rilke's poem his own more Keatsian poetic man Louis Marin.

Jacobus's point is that pastoral is always a translation generally, or simply of the translations of Heaney post-lapsarian mode.

Occasionally into the rural East Anglia where they had chosen to live the Jacobus seems not so much to be reading a poem as writing memory of the German cities of their childhoods aflame. one of her own, as when she says, "The unseen revolution of Richter's apple trees are blurred and dissolved by the près- rocks and stones and trees—all that remains of Lucy—hurtle sure of all the history that they are supposed to mask. through the poet's oblivious slumber" (1). It is not just that "hurtle" seems so much more frenetic than "Rolled": in In other chapters Jacobus's juxtapositions seem less Wordsworth's poem Lucy's death is not a dream but a harsh suggestive, as for example, the fourth, "Composing Sound: awakening.

Clouds ing in childhood, after he had acquired language, which is figure a point at which "thinking things and objects of why he was able so contentedly to retreat into a world of thought" (3) merge. As in a wonderful line that Jacobus books. His relationship with language was quite different quotes from Ashbery's "For John Clare," clouds prompt "The from those born deaf. The transition is forced, and so is the feeling that the sky might be in the back of someone's mind" transition between the 18th century debate and the interest (16). Clouds are like embodied moods, as Jacobus suggests in rural graveyards that Wordsworth displays in The Brothers, when she compares Constable's cloud studies with the poems The Excursion and the Essays upon Epitaphs. The I8th century that Wordsworth describes as "Moods of [his] own mind" was interested in sign language because it was assumed, (29). Rocks on the other hand figure the point at which the wrongly, that it might be a universal language, but to suggest world most forcefully resists the imagination's attempt to ap that Wordsworth "champions the epitaph for its universality" propriate it. In A Passage to India, Forster's Professor (87) seems to ignore Wordsworth's sense that the democracy Godbole practises a divine love that can accommodate of the graveyard is secured by a language that can address equally an old Englishwoman, a wasp, a stone, but fails at the itself at once "to the wise and the most ignorant" not because last: "no, he had been wrong to attempt the stone." It is a it is universal but because it is so insistendy local. But this barrier against which Wordsworth's imagination repeatedly chapter too is punctuated by compelling critical insights. butts, as in the leech-gatherer of "Resolution and Indepen "Everything in 'The Brothers' comes in pairs," she notes: dence" who occupies the landscape "As a huge stone is some "two brothers, two books, two bells, two hours," (89) which times seen to lie / Couched on the bald top of an eminence." seems obvious enough, except that I had never noticed it Jacobus tellingly suggests a kinship between Wordsworth's before. simile and the anthropomorphic names for rocky outcrops so common in the Lake District; the Old Woman of Helm Crag, Jacobus's prose is often ravishing, but at times the de- the Stone Man on Scawfell Head (172). Hers is a study of sign on the reader seems too evident. The first chapter, on lyric poetry, and lyrics resemble clouds. As Jacobus puts it in clouds in Clare and Constable, ends by presenting her read- one of her beautiful but precarious formulations, Constable's ers with a particularly seductive dilemma. They may choose "cloud studies are the equivalent of lyric poems, and cloud to live "under a cloud with Clare or drawn to the clouds with forms are his stanzas" (30). Lyric poems arrest the passing Constable, the nubilous man of clouds" (35). Jacobus mood, but in another guise they memorialise the dead, and, achieves a memorable closing cadence but pays for it. The as Jacobus discloses in her final chapter, when they do so dry self-mockery in Constable's remark to John Fisher, "You their kinship is not with clouds but rocks, with the grave can never be nubilous—I am the man of clouds," becomes stones on which epitaphs are chiselled. And so it is entirely plangent, but at the cost of tautology. Sometimes a reading fitting that Jacbus's book begins with clouds and ends with seems prompted less by the passage in question than the de- rocks, since clouds and rocks figure the two impulses that the mands of Jacobus's désoeuvrement. So, in the third chapter, poems that Jacobus most admires hold in balance.
