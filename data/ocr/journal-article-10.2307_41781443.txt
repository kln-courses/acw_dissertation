Today lying near the border with Siberian Russia, the Darkhat Valley marks the boundary between the vast central Asian steppe and the forested Siberian taiga. From the earliest times, this region has been a crossroads, a place where the worlds of Central Asia and the Arctic met. The result is a landscape littered with dramatic archaeologi- cal monuments, especially huge rock burial mounds known as khirigsuurs and upright stones carved with mysterious symbols. Its likely that Bronze Age nomads erected these graceful and mysterious megaliths throughout the northern regions of Mongolia and southern Siberia around 1000 B.c., though some scholars think they may be the work of later, Iron Age peoples who appeared by 700 b.c. Known as deer stones for their carved depictions of flying deer, the monuments rival Europe's megaliths in their intricate designs and careful crafts- manship. Just why they were created and what role they played in ancient nomadic cultures are two of the many puzzles in Mongolian archaeology, which was dominated by the Soviets during the Cold War. Since the early 1990s, scholars from all over the world have gravitated to Mongolia. Turkish archaeologists come to learn more about the ancient Turks, who are believed to have originated here around A.D. 500. French and German expeditions are excavating medieval sites. And since 2001, a multidisciplinary team from the Smithsonian, coor- dinated by archaeologist William Fitzhugh, has worked here in the largely overlooked Darkhat Valley of the Hovskol Aimag , or administrative region. Fitzhugh is drawn to this remote region of Mongolia because it is at the very southern edge of the Arctic world, which as the director of the Smithsonian's Arctic Studies Program he knows quite well. The worlds southernmost reindeer herders, a nomadic people known as the Tsaatan, still raise hundreds of reindeer in the tundra of the Hovksols mountains. {Tsaat means "deer" in Mongolian, which most Tsaatan speak, though some elders still speak Tuvan, a branch of the Turkic language family that is also spoken by their ethnic cousins across the Russian border.) The average Mongolian learns to ride a horse before age 10, but here in the mountains, Tsaatan children all of three years old are as comfortable on the backs of reindeer as an American child might be on a tricycle. In an effort to understand this slice of the Arctic world, Fitzhugh has put together *7</page><page sequence="3">Buddhist prayer flags decorate a modern- day stone mound, or ovoo. William Fitzhugh, far right, examines a deer stone with archaeologist Jamsranjav Baryasaikhan, left, and translator Aidyabold Namkhai. a large team of specialists, including Bruno Frolich, a Smithsonian archaeologist and physi- cal anthropologist with a particular interest in khirigsuurs, and Paula De Priest, a Smithsonian ethnobotanist. A specialist in lichens, De Priest has spent several summers with the Tsaatan studying their traditional botanical knowledge, especially as it relates to reindeer herding. The Tsaatan s way of life may be dying out thanks both to rapid modernization and global warm- ing, which threatens the lichens the reindeer depend on. A team of Smithsonian conservators headed by Harriet "Rae" Beaubien is studying ways of preserving the region s deer stones, and this summer used a 3-D laser scanning system to make extraordinarily detailed records of the monuments (see "Deer Stones in 3-D," page 21). Dubbed the Deer Stone Project, the expedition s goals are ambitious. Fitzhugh hopes to find evidence of cultural links to a circumpolar artistic tradition that could stretch from Mongolia all the way to the Pacific Northwest. "Most people think about Mongolia in terms of East-West connections," says Philip Kohl, an archaeologist at Wesleyan University who has worked on Bronze Age nomadic cultures in Central Asia. "Bill brings a whole different perspective by looking at northern connections. He's also working within a broad anthropological tradition, looking at archaeology in the context of ethnography, for instance." As early as the 1950s, American anthropologists have theorized that Mongolian Bronze Age art influenced Eskimo death masks and ivory ornaments with shamanistic and animal motifs. Fitzhughs work in Mongolia is aimed in part at looking at these possible links. Also on the expedition s plate is investi- gating the nature of the distribution of the thousands of burial mounds across the land- scape and their possible relationship to the mysterious deer stones. Still another major interest is the origins of reindeer domes- tication. Reindeer are herded throughout the Arctic world, from Scandinavia to Kamchatka, but reindeer herding may have gotten its start in northern Mongolia. Though the expedition has so far found no archaeological evidence for early reindeer herding, their search is resulting in the kind of bread-and-butter archaeological data that prehistorians depend on to formulate theories about the past. The Deer Stone Project is affiliated with archaeologists from the Mongolian Academy of Sciences and the Mongolian National Museum: T. Sanjmyatav "Sasha," an old hand who worked extensively with the Sovi- ets, and two young archaeologists, T. Odbaatar and J. Baryasaikhan (Mon- golians often use only one name), work closely with Fitzhugh. Ethnog- rapher J. Sukhbaatar, who was born in the Darkhat and maintains close ties to the Tsaatan, also works with the Smithsonian specialists. This summer I accompanied the expedition for two weeks (Pamela Slutz, the American ambassador to Mongolia, also came along for a few days) and got just a brief glimpse into its wide-ranging program, which includes mapping, surveying, excavat- ing, and ethnographic interviews, in addition to the cutting-edge conser- vation work. But as I quickly learned, any ambitious expedition in Mongolia has to budget enormous amounts of time and energy for travel, just as the ancient nomads did.

A new airline is running flights to Muron, the capital of the Hovskol Aimag, 18</page><page sequence="4">but they are booked solid, and getting reservations for an expe- dition of more than 20 people seems impossible. Overland seems to be the only way to go. The expedition - minus Frohlichs small mapping team, which managed to get plane reservations - somehow fits into four small but sturdy Russian vans. The two-day journey from Ulaanbaatar (or UB, as its affectionately known to foreigners) northwest to the Hovskol Aimag crosses some of the most beautifully rugged landscape Mongolia has to offer. The trip also doubles as a tour through one vast outdoor historical museum, beginning with UB, a typical post-Soviet decayed metropolis. There are thousands of gers, the felt yurts most Mongolians call home, pitched in thick groups that dot the hills outside of UB. We also pass fallow grain fields, the legacy of Soviet attempts to bring agriculture to a land that has prac- ticed herding for millennia. A few hundred miles from UB, the Millennium Highway, the country's only paved road extending beyond a town, ends abruptly in the middle of a vast valley. Where it ends, a network of small, rutted dirt roads springs up. Getting around Mongolia means traveling on roads that brutalize automobiles. After camping by a stream the first night, we push on to Muron, visiting several archaeological sites along the way. At one, I get my first glimpse of deer stones, albeit ones covering the burials of a people who reused the Bronze Age monuments for their own purposes. Called the "Slab Grave culture," these people rose up in the wake of the Bronze Age and seemed to revere the stones. The monuments' amazingly detailed carvings show multiple deer in what scholars call "synchronized flight." Looking at the deer, you do sense they are flying together, much like birds, with their snouts changing into what seem to be long bills; some have suggested that they are transforming into water birds. Among other carvings, the stones also usually have a circular feature, perhaps representing an earring, at the top, and a stylized dagger and belt at the bottom. This iconography persuades many scholars that the deer stones are meant in part to embody a humanlike being, perhaps memorializing an important person. The deer on the torso may represent tattoos of spirit beings who accompany the dead to the afterlife. Farther on, we cross a branch of the Hangai mountain range. As we come out of the pass, we stop at a squat anthropomorphic figure, a Turkic stone carving covered with blue Buddhist prayer rags. Below it lie offerings of food and weathered Mongolian currency, the tougric, featuring a smil- ing Genghis Khan. Its another example of how Mongolians throughout history have reused and revisited ancient sacred sites. Todays Mongols use the sites of the ancient Turkic people, who flourished in Mongolia from about A.D. 550 to 730, just as they use Bronze Age monuments for their own Buddhist rituals. Before the day is out we reach Muron. A few miles outside the medium-size town, Bruno Fröhlich has already pitched camp in the Delger river valley and is busy mapping the thousands of burial mounds in the vicinity. The American ambassador, Pamela Slutz, is also already here. Fröhlich takes her to a nearby ridge overlooking the valley. The view is spectacular, and dozens of khirigsuurs are visible in every direction. Some are ringed with square stone align- ments, others with circular arrangements. "My crazy idea," says Fröhlich, "is that the square and circular alignments may indicate the sex of the buried individual. But only a program of excavation will tell for sure." Thus far, there has been no systematic excavation of khirigsuurs, and some may not even be burial mounds. For now Fröhlich is content to map the sites, sometimes at a pace of a hundred per day. Excavation will come later, perhaps next summer. On a rise above the camp is one of Mongolia's archaeo- logical treasures, the site of Ushkin Uver (which translates as "Lung Mountain," a reference to the similarity in shape of nearby mountains to sheep lungs). Amidst a number of stone burial mounds are 14 deer stones, anywhere from three feet to eight feet tall, including one with a face carved atop it, which is extremly rare. The effect of the faded human face is haunting. Unfortunately, the unique stone has attracted vandals, who have painted graffiti on it. The monuments, so close to Muron, are particularly vulnerable to vandalism and even theft. Its thought there were once 1 5 stones at Ushkin www.archaeology.org 19</page><page sequence="5">A rare deer stone with a human face, Stone 14 at the site of Ushkin Uver is a frequent target of vandalism. Below, a Bronze Age khirigsuur, or burial mound, at the site of Ulan Tolgoi near Lake Erkhel. Uver, and that one has been looted in recent years. The local government recently turned the site into a kind of archaeological park, which will hopefully discourage this kind of behavior. Aware that the site is one that would benefit from more complete recording, Beaubien and her team get to work testing their scanning equipment on one of the smaller stones. The results are mixed. Sunlight and wind conspire to make laser scanning difficult. As the conservators work at Ushkin Uver, the ambassador accompanies Fitzhugh and De Priest to the governors office in the center of Muron to register their project, a process that is redolent of residual Soviet officialdom. Permit to north spend to in the hand, the Darkhat night the expedition at Valley, Lake stopping Erkhel, heads Permit north to the Darkhat Valley, stopping to spend the night at Lake Erkhel, where another fantastic deer-stone site, called Ulan Tolgoi, is nestled amongst huge khirigsuur overlooking the small lake. (There is a strange abundance of dead birds. A team of biologists later found the avian flu H5N1 had killed them.) One deer stone stands more than 15 feet high, and is the tallest known in Mongolia. Fitzhugh and his crew have excavated here in previous fields seasons. Around one deer stone, the team found horse head burials that date to the late Bronze Age, about 900 b.c. The burials are arranged in a circle around the monument, which Fitzhugh believes shows they were part of the original dedication of the deer stone. The dating is important, and advances a theory proposed by art historian Esther Jacobson-Tepfer of the University of Oregon that Mongolian deer stone art is an early form of the famed Scythian animal art style that spread across much of Central Asia by 600 b.c. Some Soviet scholars argued that the deer stones were derivative of the Scythian style. But Fitzhugh feels his dating at Ulan Tolgoi supports the idea that nomads in Mongolia were already carving their impres- sive monuments by the time Scythian art became the rage in Eurasia. It takes another day for the team to reach the Darkhat Valley. The entrance to the valley is marked by a number of ovoos, large sacred stone piles that Mongolian Buddhists place at important points on the landscape, often marking the political boundary of territories. Mongolian Buddhists traditionally add rocks to the ovoo as an offering while praying for a safe journey. That night we make camp in a small valley called Eft, just upstream of a large number of standing stones. Khirigsuurs dot the small valley. Next on the agenda is a visit to the Tsaatan reindeer herders in the mountains above the camp. Fitzhugh starts some of the archaeologists digging around a curi- ous, undecorated upright stone not far from where the expedition has pitched its tents. The rest of the crew heads up to the sum- mer camp of the Tsaatan. Numbering just a few hundred, many of the Tsaatan pitch their summer camps in an alpine meadow near at the headwaters of a stream called Mendebulug. 20 Archaeology • January/February 2006</page><page sequence="6">Smithsonian conservators shield their scanner from sunlight, above, while collecting data resulting in the image below. Left, Harriet Beaubien monitors scanning as Vicky Karas guides the laser across a stone's surface. c IS a I tC I X &gt;, Ï § V Deer Stones in 3-D Most harsh northern of environmental the Mongolia approximately are conditions isolated 500 and deer that exposed stones threaten to in northern Mongolia are isolated and exposed to harsh environmental conditions that threaten to weather them into oblivion. Even their relative isolation doesn't deter vandalism and the occasional looting of stones. In some ways, the monuments are a conservators nightmare. But they also provide a unique opportunity to test a new technology that is beginning to be adopted by the conservation community: 3-D laser scanning. "Its still a little-known technique in the archaeology and museum fields," says Harriet "Rae" Beaubien, a conservator at the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Edu- cation (SCMRE). This past sum- mer, working with SCMRE fellow Vicky Karas and Carolyn Thome, an expert model maker from the Smithsonian's Office of Exhibits, Beaubien used a laser scanner to digitally record 1 0 deer stones. The premise is simple. The scanner projects laser light at an object, creating a detailed profile of the objects surface that can then be processed into a highly accurate three-dimensional image. "It's hand- held and portable and easy to use with fast results," says Beaubien. "It's not yet a technique that a nor- mal archaeological project might use. But it's got great potential for research, long-term preservation, and conservation." Monuments like deer stones are traditionally recorded by taking pho- tographs or making line drawings. "Those are great techniques, and they have the advantage of being low cost and relatively easy to do," says Beaubien. "But with the scan- ning you get something fantastic. Its true beauty is the three-dimensional aspect." Photographs and drawings can gloss over details like edges and depth, especially important when studying something as intricately carved as a deer stone. A 3-D scan can create a record of the surface down to the tiniest detail, which would make it possible for art his- torians to assess the possibility that templates, something like ancient c s 3 "O ÜJ -u c « -C ? v. jij O S c y U c '5 o -C E C/5 3 Õ stencil kits, were used to make the deer-stone designs. " The scan allows you to record these designs very, very accurately," says Beaubien. "So its fodder for art historians and people interested in technology." The scans can also be used to create faithful replicas of monu- ments for display and research, and that could replace objects in the field that need to be removed because they are at particularly high risk. Perhaps the only drawback to the technology is that the laser is sensitive to light, which the Mon- golian steppe has in abundance. Most of the team s time was spent devising shelters for their equip- ment and the deer stones that were being scanned. Eventually, the crew worked out a system of teepee-like structures that could cover even the tallest deer stones. Once they had the logistics worked out, it took two hours to set up the shelter and only an hour to scan a deer stone. Next year the team plans to return to Mongolia to scan the deer stones at Ushkin Uver, a site that has already lost at least one monu- ment to looting. -EAP www.archaeology.org 21</page><page sequence="7">Members of the Deer Stone Project excavate a curious undecorated stone in the Darkhat Valley, one of hundreds of upright stones in the region. But before we can reach the Tsaatan, we pay another official visit, this time to the local administrator in his office in the village of Tsaganuur. The official is a young man, a former teacher, who has just taken office. In a recent elec- tion he defeated the incumbent administrator, who, we learn, may not have had the best interests of the Tsaatan at heart. Apparently, much of a supply of canvas sent from the U.S. embassy for the Tsaatan to use for their tents was actually parcelled out by the previous administrator to inhabitants of the lowland areas as well. After a lengthy visit to the border guards offices in Tsaganuur, the expedition rendezvous with the Tsaatan at the head of a narrow valley that leads to Mendebulug. The Tsaatan treat all of the team, especially De Priest, as old friends. Outfitted with horses, we head up the valley and into the mountains. After eight hours of a steep, hard climb on horseback, which is partially alleviated by a clear view of the vast Darkhat Valley and the neighboring Sayan mountains, we reach the Tsaatan camp. About a dozen teepees are scattered throughout a small valley. I can spot a couple of satellite dishes, and reindeer are everywhere. Completely docile, most of them are lying down behind the tents, tied to stakes. The Tsaatan use reindeer for milk and transport. They rarely slaughter them for food. But there are signs that reindeer herding may not be viable much longer. Because of the onset of global warming, the tundra at this elevation is effectively thawing, and the lichens the reindeer feed on are not as prevalent as they once were. To hedge their bets, the Tsaatan are bringing lowland yaks and sheep into the mountains, which no one on the expedition can remember seeing at the camp before. Along with other ethnographers and archaeologists, Fit- zhugh believes that reindeer husbandry may have gotten its start here on the southern margins of the reindeer habitat. Perhaps inspired by the close proximity of domesticated horses, the people who once lived where the Tsaatan do today may have taken it upon themselves to train reindeer, using horses as a model. A trip to Mendebulug means a visit to the tent of Suyan, a woman who is more than 100 years old, and is the groups most revered shaman. She is the only source for much of Tsaa- tan tradition and folklore. Her frail body and ancient face give us all a sense of how she is linked to a mystical tradition that dates back thousands of years. Its this tradition that Fitzhugh thinks might be responsible for similarities in ritual artifacts used by people across the Arctic world, people as different as the Tsaatan and the Alaskan Eskimo. There is not much archaeology to be done in the alpine meadows at this altitude, though Fitzhugh has excavated sites here before, including a Neolithic hunting encampment. On this visit, while taking shelter from a storm squall in the tent of a Tsaatan man name Bayandalai, a youth named Erdne shows us two stone artifacts that he found downstream where his family had pitched camp the season before. With a gleam in his eye, Fitzhugh gets on one of Bayandalai s horses and heads to the site with Erdne. I trail behind. We don't find any other artifacts, but its a tantalizing hint that there is more archaeology to be done in the mountains, though digging here is logistically quite difficult. There are no roads, and everything must be brought in on horseback, which limits the amount of work that can be done. After several rounds of visiting Tsaatan families in their tents, we have had our fill of tea and reindeer cheese, which the Tsaatan are quick to offer any visitor, and its time to get back down to the valley and the lowland archaeological sites. De Priest stays behind to spend the week with the Tsaatan, who have agreed to accompany her on horseback to the Russian border to look for rare plants. The trip down is quicker, though muddy. When we reach the lowland, the Mongolians let their horses run. After spending time cooped up in the mountains, all the horses are eager to run. Its exhilarating to race across the steppe. Back at camp, we find the crew has dug deep around the unmarked stone Fitzhugh had selected for excavation. They have dis- covered a curious east-west stone alignment below the surface, as well as bones that should date the monument. 22 Archaeology • January/February 2006</page><page sequence="8">The Tsaatan summer camp at Mendebulug offers plenty of lichen, fodder for the large reindeer herds. More than 100 years old, this Tsaatan elder, Suyan, is a link to a millennia- old shamanistic tradition. The next day, the ambassador leaves, and while the crew continues to dig, two American volunteers, Denis Rydjeski and Betsy Eldredge, and I accompany Odbaatar on a survey of the valleys khirigsuurs. For two days we record dozens of the stone mounds before we come across something really exciting: a previously unknown granite deer stone lying on its side in the floodplain. It looks like a simple stone, but Eldredge has sharp eyes, and traces the stones faint telltale belt with her fingers. She also makes out the faint impressions of an earring carving. Other features reveal themselves as the light changes. Beaubien and her team do a 3-D scan of the stone, which could reveal even more features. My last day with the archaeologists is spent backfilling the trenches around the upright stone. They feel that it is probably Turkic, based on the alignments of stone that they've found beneath the monument, which often accompany Turkic ritual sites. But only dating the bones will tell for sure. Leaving the archaeologists after a feast of Mongolian BBQ prepared by the expeditions drivers, I hitch a ride back to Muron with Beaubien and her team, who are headed back to Lake Erkhel to scan more deer stones. My last day with them is spent in the towns vast market, where Beaubien buys large bolts of black cloth. Her team has discovered it needs a reliable tent to shelter their equipment from the sun, which disturbs the scanner. As I leave, she is discussing ways to fashion a makeshift shelter with Tsog, our driver - a low-tech conversation that has to be had before they can use their cutting-edge laser. The years work Deer investigating away Stone from Project the completion; rich is cul- still years away from completion; work investigating the rich cul- tural history of the steppe-taiga bound- ary in the Hovskol Aimag will likely continue for some time. More excavation and further study of deer-stone iconography will be needed to determine if Mongolia gave birth to the Scythian animal art style, though new radiocarbon dating from this summers excavations of still more horse-head burials from Lake Erkhel confirms that the deer stones predate the rise of the Scythians. Fitzhugh also needs more time to study whether Bronze Age Mon- golia did indeed have some influence on cultures as far away as the Alaskan Eskimo. Frohlichs burial-mound map- ping project will guide a senes or targeted excavations dunng coming field seasons. If his team can recover bone from enough of the khirigsuurs, they may be able to assess whether the square and circle patterns were used to symbolize gender in prehistoric Mongolia. And all the expedition members are pooling their data with a political scientist, Claudio Cioffi-Revilla of George Mason University. An expert in computer simulations of social net- works over space and time, Cioffi-Revilla will use the Deer Stone Project results, along with information from two other expeditions, to model the prehistoric rise of the nomadic cul- tures of Mongolia. Fröhlich and Fitzhugh s carefully collected data will be added to a computer simulation that aims to show, in the words of the project proposal, "how a relatively obscure group of steppe nomads managed to conquer and rule such a substantial swath of the Old World." ■ Eric A.
