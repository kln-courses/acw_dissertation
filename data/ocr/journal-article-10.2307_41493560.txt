G. de CASPARIS One of the most interesting historical sites in the state of Negri Sembilan, Malaysia, is the tomb of Ahmat Majanu (or Sheikh Ahmad Majnün, as the name is spelt in the inscriptions in Arabic script) at the site known as Kramat Sungai Udang near the bank of the Linggi river and at a few miles' distance from the kampung of Pengkalan Kempas (or Kampas). The site, which attracts numerous, mainly Chinese, visitors, is under the care of the Museum Division (Jabatan Muzium) of the government of Malaysia. The tomb is easily accessible both from the state capital at Seremban and from the historic town of Malacca (Malaka). The antiquities at this site wrere described by Ivor H. N. Evans more than half a century ago.1 Besides the tombstone (Plate 1), which is the main topic dealt with in this paper, one notices a number of megaliths (Plate 4). One of these is roundish in shape (Plate 5) and shows an intricate design with geometrical patterns. According to popular belief it represents the shield worn by the holy man who is buried there. Another of the megaliths is known as the sword (pedang) (Plate 6) or the creese (keris) of the saint. For these and other mega- liths the reader is referred to Evans' above-mentioned article. The present contri- bution is, apart from a brief note on the sword, confined to the tombstone with its four inscriptions on the upper parts of its four faces and, in particular, to the north and south faces showing inscriptions in a type of script which, in the absence of a better designation, can be defined as Kawi.2 As to the inscriptions on the east and west faces, these were long ago transliterated and studied by C. Boden Kloss and published as a postscript to Evans* article. They are written in Arabic script adapted to the writing of Malay texts, usually called Jawi. Despite a few minor lacunae these Jawi inscriptions present no serious problems.3 In brief, the Jawi inscriptions (the texts of the east and west faces are identi- cal) describe the tomb as that of Sheikh Ahmad Maj(e)nun ; the spot is also called • It is a pleasure for me to express my profound gratitude to Tan Sri Dato Mubin Sheppard, who* first called my attention to this puzzling inscription and gave me all kinds of help and encouragement in my attempts, as well as to Othman bin Mohd.

S3 an 'abode of peace' (dâru'Uamân) and the peace of god is implored for the Sheikh. Such phrases are common-place and would cause no surprise were it not for the fact that the Kawi inscriptions appear to give a totally different impression of Ahmat Majanu, but more about this later. As to the Jawi inscriptions, they are dated 872 (written out in full as delapan ratus tujuh puluh dua tahun) of the Hijrah era during the reign of Sultan Mansûr Shãh. This year, corresponding to A.D. 1467/68, does fall within the reign of Mansûr Shãh (1459-1477). As to the Kawi inscriptions, Boden Kloss confined himself to a brief dis- cussion of the script, which was compared with Thai script. Six years later the inscriptions on the north and south faces were studied by the Dutch prehistorian and archaeologist P. V. van Stein Callenfels.4 The latter correctly defined the script as a form of Kawi used in numerous inscriptions of ancient Java and Sumatra. Van Stein Callenfels gave a transcription which is substantially correct, though one may have doubt about some details. As to his interpretation of the text I have, however, much more serious reservations. Thus Van Stein Callenfels concluded that the saint buried at Kempalan Kempas would by no means have been a holy man but, on the contrary, a traitor who was executed after an unsuccessful attempt at the life of Mansur Shãh. In keeping with this interpretation Van Stein Callenfels put the word 'saint' within inverted commas. It is, however, surprising that this learned scholar made no attempt to explain how the tomb of a traitor could also be described as a dãru ' l-amãn in the Jawi inscriptions, which contain not the slightest allusion to any dishonourable element in the Sheikh's conduct. It seems even more difficult in that case to account for the fact that Ahmat Majanu's tombstone was, until recent times, used as a place where local people went to swear oaths. As one can see from the photograph (Plates 2 &amp; 3), one of the most prominent features of the tombstone is the presence of a large round hole piercing the inscribed stele between its northern and southern faces. It is told that the person swearing the oath used to put his arm through the hole and was believed to suffer unbearable pain if he swore a false oath, as the stone would tighten around his arm. It is difficult to believe that the stone could have been used for such a purpose if it marked the tomb of a traitor put to death by Mansûr Shãh. It seems much more likely that the stone was used for that particular purpose not only because it stood at a particularly holy spot, but also because it had this typical hole just of the right size to put a man's arm through. This does not, of course, necessarily imply that the hole was made for this very pur- pose; on the contrary, this is quite unlikely as the inscriptions nowhere allude to any oath. It is therefore preferable to look for another explanation of the hole. Thus, this stone may be old and pre-Islamic as part of an ancient sanctuary to which also the other megaliths may have belonged. This raises, however, another problem as it seems difficult to understand why just this stone with a hole was selected as a tombstone. I therefore prefer a totally different explana- *P.

Evans has-orightly pointed out that the sandstone of the inscribed pillar (batu Acheh) does not occur in this part of the peninsula. This implies that the pillar must have been carried to Pëngkalan Këmpas from a considerable distance. By making this hole it was possible to pass a pole through the stone to carry it as a pikulan.5 The conclusion that the inscribed stone does not originate from the Pëngkalan Kempas area may provide us with a satisfactory answer to a hitherto unnoticed riddle surrounding the inscribed stone, as we shall see from the sequence. The article by Van Stein Callenfels understandably aroused new interest in the Pengkalan Kempas inscriptions. In 1931 R. J. Wilkinson re-examined the above conclusions in a short, but important, article.6 From the data pro- vided by Van Stein Callenfels Wilkinson drew an entirely different conclusion. Instead of describing Ahmat Majanu as a traitor Wilkinson suggested that 'Shaikh Ahmad's reputation has suffered from the publicity given him; and it is due to him that he should be defended from the charge of being a "saintly rascal." He may have been a martyr.' Wilkinson then called attention to an interesting passage in the Stjarah Melayu relating to events in Sëning Ujung, which he identified with Sungai Ujung, the area in which Pëngkalan Këmpas is situated. From this rather cryptic passage (its obscurity may suggest that the chronicler may have had something to hide), as well as from local traditions, admittedly of a mythical character,7 Wilkinson reconstructed a chain of events which seems historically quite plausible, though incapable of real proof. He suggested that Sheikh Ahmat Majanu may have acted as a spokesman for Proto-Malays in conflict with powerful nobles holding the area (Sungai Ujung) as a fief. When the Proto-Malays came down-river to make complaints against their exploiters the situation got out of control: all the tribesmen were massacred and Ahmat, too, was killed. When it was later realized that a mistake had been made the Sultan punished those responsible: even the powerful Tun Perak was deprived of his fief in the area. Such a course of events would account for the apparent contradiction : how could some-one on the one hand be considered a traitor or, at least, a person acting 'for some treacherous purpose' (berbuat daya) and, on the other hand, a saint whose grave draws or drew pilgrims from elsewhere ? If, indeed, Ahmaťs bravery was devoted to the service of the indigenous tribes his behaviour could be seen by the Malaccan nobles as treason, whereas others could have held his 5 The inscribed stele is of sandstone (batu Acheh) whereas all the other megaliths are either granite or laterite. This difference, coupled with the fact that sandstone is apparently unknown in the Pëngkalan Këmpas area, is a clear indication that the stele probably originates from else- where. For the details see Evans, art. c.it , pp. 166 f. 6R. J. Wilkinson, 'The Pëngkalan Këmpas "Saint" ' J.M.B.R.A.S. IX, 1931, pp. 134 f. 7It seems to me that Wilkinson read too much in the Sijarah Milayu passage concerning Sëning Ujung. Apart from the uncertainty that the name should indeed be identified with Sungai Ujung, it can be argued on the basis of this passage that the Sultan wanted to reward the Dato Sri Naradiraja rather than to punish the bindahara. In that case one may assume that the latter, who probably already enjoyed many fiefs, would have received ample compensation for his loss of part of the revenue from Sëning Ujung. 3</page><page sequence="5">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="6">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="7">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="8">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="9">J. G. DE CASPÀRIS JMBRAS, VOL. 53 name in high esteem as that of a martyr sacrificing himself in the interest of the poor and deprived. In addition, Wilkinson's view is to some extent consistent with the presence at the site of a number of megaliths, which could well be asso- ciated with some Proto-Malay tribe. Although Wilkinson's interpretation marks considerable progress in com- parison with earlier attempts one can raise serious objections against it. It should be emphasized that Ahmat Majanu's tomb was, at a distance of about thirty miles, within easy reach of the capital. Is it at all likely that Mansür Shãh or his successors should have tolerated that the tomb of some-one killed or executed for treason should have developed into a place of pilgrimage, 'a mansion of peace', as it is expressed in the inscriptions in Arabic writing ? The punishment of some incompetent officials would not normally have entailed the rehabilitation of their victims. Even if the court was unable to prevent the place from turning into a holy spot it would certainly have ensured that the inscriptions on the tomb left no doubt as to what happened to some-one who disobeyed orders. There is, however, a more serious objection. Wilkinson's idea of a noble Sheikh defending the interests of the underdog, in this case the Sakai of Negri Sembilan, against those of the Malaccan nobles may fit well into the ideals of some enlightened British official of the later protectorate but there is no evidence for similar attitudes held by the ruling circles of ancient Malacca (or any other ancient state). For these reasons I feel that Wilkinson's inter- pretation cannot be accepted in the form in which it was given. The next scholar to study the Pengkalan Kěmpas inscriptions was Sir Richard Winstedt. In his History of Negri Sembilan 8 he generally followed the views expressed by Van Stein Callenfels and Wilkinson, to which he added some ideas of his own. On the basis of the supposedly Minangkabau features of the megaliths around the grave he connected the inscription with the beginning of Minang- kabau immigration into Negri Sëmbilan, which may well have started in about this period, viz . the middle of the fifteenth century A.D. As to Ahmat Majanu, Sir Winstedt suggested that he may have been the leader of a group of immi- grants but, at some stage, he would have 'played a dirty trick', was subsequently defeated and, presumably after having been taken prisoner, 'died a low death (presumably at the hands of the executioner).' Sir Richard further noted that 'according to the Arabic inscriptions the grave is a mansion of peace, a place of goodness, and the peace and the help of God are invoked for its occupant.'9 It seems as though this reconstruction raises more problems than it may solve. If, in the eyes of the Malaccan authorities, Ahmat Majanu had behaved treacherously, is it likely that the Jawi inscriptions should have described the 8R. O. Winstedt, *A history of Negri Sembilan from the Fourteenth to the Sixteenth Century', y.M.B.R.A.S. XII, 1934, p. 44. For the traditions concerning the beginnings of Minang- kabau immigration into Negri Sembilan see especially P.E. de Josselin de Jong 'Minangkabau and Negri Sembilan / Leiden 1957, pp. 120-122. 9The paraphrase 'died a low death* is presumably based on the words pada alah of A 8, but alah, though by no means honorific, is a neutral form. The word may not refer back to Ahmat himself but rather to his companions. 4</page><page sequence="10">PLATE 2 The inscribed Tombstone, showing the Kazvi inscription (above the round hole) and the Jawi inscription.

As to the megaliths, it is difficult to substan- tiate the view that they show characteristic Minangkabau features; as Evans has shown, parallels can be found in different parts of South East Asia.10 As to the script, it is difficult to pinpoint any precise place of origin. It is true that the Kawi script of the Pëngkalan Këmpas inscriptions can be traced back to the Old Sumatranese variety of Kawi script used in the inscriptions of Ãdityavarman, but that was about a century earlier.11 In the intervening period this type of script had spread to other parts of Sumatra, as appears from the Minye Tujuh inscription of 1380.12 This site is situated in the neighbourhood of Lhokseumawe on the north coast of Acheh at a distance of some 400 miles northwest of Ãditya- varman's capital. In fact, the script of the Kawi inscription of Pëngkalan Këmpas is remarkably similar to that of the Minye Tujuh inscription. There is no doubt that this similarity is much closer than that appearing between either of these and the inscriptions of Ãdityavarman. There is therefore no particular reason to connect the Pëngkalan Këmpas inscription with the migration of families from the Minangkabau area of central Sumatra into Negri Sembilan. There is un- fortunately no indication as to Ahmat Majanu's place of origin. Possibly, the second part of his name may provide a clue, but this is of little help as long as the name Majanu cannot be traced. Again a few years later the Pëngkalan Këmpas inscriptions were briefly discussed by J. M. Gullick in his detailed study of Sungai Ujung.13 In the context of the trade along the Linggi river he also mentioned 'the shadowy tale of the unsuccessful rebellion of Sheikh Ahmad, also called Ahmad Majanu' but, although Gullick did full honour to the earlier interpretations of Van Stein Callenfels and others, he was fully aware of the incongruities and other problems surrounding these inscriptions. Thus, he stated that 'whatever explanation is adopted there remains the difficulty of Sheikh Ahmad's tomb. When a revolt fails the victors do not usually erect a monument to the leader of the losing side. Perhaps in the revulsion against Tun Takal the followers of Sheikh Ahmad were, as a conciliatory gesture, allowed to commemorate him. It is also puzzling that there should be inscriptions in two different scripts which are neither iden- tical nor completely different in their content, as though they were written inde- pendently about the same subject. If the rebels were Sakai and immigrants they may have preferred to pay their tributes separately.'14 This passage has been quoted in full because it emphasizes the principal problem inherent in all the different attempts at solving the mystery of Ahmat lOEvans, art. cit., pp. 170-173. ll As to Malayu script (cf. the work mentioned in note 2 above) there is no doubt that it is based on Old Javanese Kawi but not, as one might have thought, on Old Javanese script of the Maja- pahit period but on a much earlier phase, probably of the tenth century. 12W.

Before, however, a new attempt is made in this direction two other contributions should be briefly mentioned. The study by Diane Lewis on Inas, a small district in the interior of NSgri SSmbilan, is mainly of interest for us for the understanding of the general background, including the relationships prevail- ing between the Proto-Malays and the immigrant communities.15 Finally, in 1968 there appeared a postumous article by L.-C. Damais, in fact a survey of Muslim epigraphy in South East Asia, originally written in 1962.16 The account of the Pengkalan Kempas inscriptions is evidently based on the article by Van Stein Callenfels of 1927. It was probably not intended for publication in that form. Thus, it is written there that 'la date est un millésime 1385, donc en ère Šaka, soit 1467 (-68) EC.' There is some confusion here, for the Saka year 1385 corresponds, of course, to A.D. 1463/64, whereas 1467/68 is the A.D. equivalent of the year 872 of the Hijrah era, the date given in the inscriptions in Jawi script according to the transliteration of Boden Kloss, which is undoubted- ly correct. On the other hand, this error is of some interest because it turns our attention to one of the riddles surrounding the PSngkalan KSmpas inscrip- tions: the approximately four years' difference between the dates given in the Kawi and Jawi inscriptions. If, however, this riddle can be solved it may point the way towards a solution of some of the other problems. I can see only two possible solutions of the discrepancy between the two dates. The explanation which first comes to one's mind is that of a mistake in either or both of the dates. Apart from the somewhat remote possibility of a mistake in the writing of the Kawi numerals (5 instead of 9)17 this amounts to a mistake in calculation during the transitional period from an Indian to the Muslim system of chronology. In that case, however, it is impossible to decide which of the dates is wrong. One may argue that the Šaka era was already archaic in the Malay Peninsula in the second half of the fifteenth century, so that there was uncertainty about the correct Šaka year. Although this kind of mistake cannot be entirely excluded it hardly seems likely, especially on account of the close relations existing between Malacca and Java, where the Šaka era remained in use till long after the Pengkalan KSmpas inscriptions. The scribe who drafted the text of the Kawi inscription would therefore have had little difficulty in find- ing out in what Šaka year he was living. A mistake in the Hijrah year is even less plausible. It is true that the use of the era was still a relatively recent deve- lopment at that time in the Malay Peninsula, so that a mistake could be attributed to lack of experience. As, however, the scribes responsible for the drafting of the inscriptions were undoubtedly Muslims (all four faces begin with Muslim invocations), it does not seem likely that they should have been in ignorance 15 Diane Lewis, 'Inas: A Study of Local History', J.M.B.R.A.S. XXXIII, 1960, pp. 65-94. 16L.-C. Damais, 'L'Epigraphie Musulmane dans le Sud-Est Asiatique', B.E.F.È.O.

Especially confusions between 2 and 4, 6 and 9, 8 and 9 are frequently found in the older transcriptions. On the other hand, 5 and 9 are as different from one another as any numerical marks can be. 6</page><page sequence="14">PLATE 4.

One may add that this era had already been used in the Trengganu inscription so that it must have been known in the Peninsula since about a century at least. If, therefore, any mistake has to be assumed it seems, on balance, slightly more likely to have occurred in the Šaka year. The main conclusion that can, however, be drawn from these considera- tions is that a mistake either in the Šaka year or in the Hijrah year is unlikely. Thus, among the numerous dates found in Old Javanese and Old Balinese inscrip- tions only few examples of faulty dates are attested and these, also on other grounds, raise doubts about their authenticity.18 In the light of these considerations it has to be concluded that both dates are correct, implying that the Kawi and the Jawi inscriptions are not contem- porary. This is less surprising than it may seem at first. As J. M. Gullick has rightly emphasized,19 the two texts, though both concerned with Ahmat Majanu/ Shaikh Ahmad Majnün, are by no means identical, they give the impression of being 'independently written about the same subject', as Gullick formulated it. One may go a little further. The two inscriptions in Jawi script, as transcribed by Boden Kloss, appear to be nearly identical. They are a kind of requiescat in pace in conventional terms and mention the name of the deceased as Shaikh Ahmad Majnun; in addition, they express the date in fully spelt out Malay numerals ( duãlãpan rãtus tüjuh püluh dua tãhurt , i.e. 872), adding that this date fell in the time of the reign of Sultan Mansur Shah (pada zamãnnya sultán mansür shãh). The text gives no details whatever about the manner in which the Sheikh died. On the other hand, the two Kawi faces are by no means identical; on the contrary, they constitute a single inscription starting on the north side and continued (and concluded) on the southern face. Despite a few uncertainties there can be no doubt that the Kawi text does not mention the Sheikh's tomb or burial; the inscription is merely concerned with the circumstances in which Ahmat Majanu met his fate. Apart from this basic difference in approach there is a striking difference in the spelling of the name of the deceased. In the Kawi text his name is twice spelt Ahmat Majanu (the form adopted in the present article except in direct quotations) and once simply Afrmat. In all these cases' his first name ends in a -t in accordance with Malay pronunciation, while the name is never preceded by Shaikh. The Jawi inscriptions, on the other hand, 18It is again Louis Damais who, by his painstaking studies, has vindicated the general correctness of the dates in inscriptions. Most dates admit of checking, as they give many details, which must, of course, be compatible if the figures of the year are correctly expressed and correctly interpreted. Sec, for instance, his 'Etudes d'Épigraphie Indonésienne', IV, in B.E.F.E.O. XLVI, Fase. 1, 1952, pp. 1-105. 19&lt;It is also puzzling that there should be inscriptions in two different scripts which are neither identical nor completely different in their content, as though they were written independently about the same subject. If the rebels were Sakai and immigrants they may have preferred to pay their tribute separately.' (J. M. Gullick, art. cit., p. 56). - As will appear from the sequence, I prefer a somewhat different explanation. While it is understandable that the immi- grants, whatever their origin, should have used the 'alien', i.e. Arabic, script (although there is, as we have seen, a considerably older example of its being used for writing Malay) it is less plausible that the "tribal Sakai should have had their tribute expressed in a Kawi alphabet of probably Sumatranese origin. In addition, Gullick's interpretation does not account for the four years' difference in date between the Kawi and Jawi texts. 7</page><page sequence="16">J. О. DE CASPARIS JMBRAS, VOL. 53 spell the first name with final -d and give the second name as Maj(ě)nůn, which is clearly different from Majanu.20 Such slight differences may appear to be of minor importance, but they clearly indicate that the two texts were not only written by different hands, but also drafted by different minds. It is therefore not very surprising that they should bear different dates. The fact that the Kawi inscription is dated four years earlier than the two Jawi inscriptions is in accordance with this line of thought: in the period intervening between the foundation of the memorial stone and the funerary monument the militant hero Ahmat Majanu had become the saintly Sheikh Ahmad Maj(e)nûn. Before, however, considering the impli- cations of such an inference I must briefly mention two other points. It may seem surprising that initially only two opposite faces of the stone were inscribed, viz. the present north and south faces, as though the original engravers would have foreseen the later reassessment of Ahmat's conduct. Even so it is difficult to understand why they did not use two adjoining faces for the original inscription. In my view there is only one satisfactory explanation to account for the use of two opposite faces, viz. by assuming that the stele was part of some building such as a wall or a gateway. Secondly, it seems probable that the original monument was erected at the site of the battle in which Ahmat lost his life. The reason why only a memorial stone, instead of a proper funerary monument, was erected there at that time may have been an obvious one: Ahmat's body may not have been recovered at the time, perhaps because it had been snatched away by the attacking party. A few years later, however, after the area had been pacified and the presumed mortal remains of Ahmat Majanu had been recovered, the hero was given a true Muslim burial. At that time the memorial stone was removed from its original site, pierced so that it could be transported, and taken to the spot where it still stands: Kramat Sungai Udang near the mouth of the Linggi river. A strong point in favour of such a reconstruction is the fact that the cylin- drical hole was made just below the lines of writing on the north and south faces. If the hole had already been there before the Kawi inscription was engraved it would have been very difficult to fit the writing into the available space. To avoid such a difficulty the stone-cutter would no doubt have chosen the east and west faces to engrave the Kawi inscription. On the other hand, the reason why the hole was pierced on the north and south faces below the inscribed text and 2°Maj(iXnän is apparently an 'arabized' form of the name, although it is hardly a flattering one since means as much as 'possessed by a demon (hantu) mad', see John D. Gimlette and H. W. Thomson, with Forward by Sir Malcolm Watson, A Dictionary of Malayan Medicine, O.U.P., London etc., 1939, s.v. majnun. The idea that Ahmat's behaviour in sacrificing him- self for his lord was not only brave but also foolhardy may be a modern one (cf. P. E. de Josselin de Jong, 'The Rise and Decline of A National Hero", J.M.B.R.A.S. XXXVIII, 2, 1965, pp. 140-155, on different attitudes towards Hang Tuah, a younger contemparary of our Ahmat) but it may not be wholly foreign to ancient attitudes either. - As to Majanu, it is no less a puzzling name, as it is no doubt derived itomjanu = tubajënu, 'a kind of arrow poison, derived from a plant' (see Wilkinson's Dictionary, s.v.). As one finds, in the entire area, numerous toponyms derived from plants one wonders whether Majanu or Majênu was a place name with which our hero was associated. Apart from Majene, the well known town on the west coast of southern Sulawesi (which seems rather far away) I have not found any toponym of this kind. 8</page><page sequence="17">PLATE 6.

For it was, at that stage, still difficult to estimate the length of the new inscription or rather, of the space required for that purpose. It was therefore quite natural that the hole was made on the north and south sides just below the lines of writing. Up to this point one can, in my view, arrive at a plausible reconstruction of the course of events relating to the inscribed stele. A much more doubtful point concerns the reason or reasons why Kramat Sungai Udang was chosen as the final resting place of the saint. In other words, why was the funerary monu- ment not erected at the spot where Ahmat Majanu had been killed? There must have been strong reasons for such a laborious move to be carried out. I can think of several possibilities between which it is difficult to choose. Thus, one may suggest that Kramat Sungai Udang was the place where his mortal remains were recovered. Another possibility is that Ahmat Majanu originated from this area, where he may have held a responsible position. Such sites near the mouths of rivers are of considerable economic importance as they may have served as centres for the exchange of commodities from the interior and from abroad. A third possibility, less likely in my view, is one associated with Winstedťs view about Aljmat Majanu as the chief of a group of Minangkabau migrants who would have set foot on Malaysian soil at or near Pengkalan KSmpas. If, however, we follow Wilkinson's suggestion, which is hardly more probable, one may suppose that this was the spot where Ahmat arrived after coming down the river with his Proto-Malays. Finally, the solution which I prefer, Sungai Kramat Udang was chosen as the final resting place of the saint because it had been a holy spot since time immemorial. The presence at the site of a number of megaliths, briefly mentioned at the beginning of this article, may give some support to this view, if it can indeed be shown that the megaliths are much older than the inscribed stele. This would certainly be one's first impression, but the difficulty is the presence of the word Allãh, standing out inrelief11 just below the 'curiously shaped head' of the sword.22 As it is unlikely that the word should have been carved at a later stage23 it has to be concluded that the pedang post- dates the introduction of Islam into this part of the Peninsula. This implies 21 See Plate V of Evans* article quoted in note 1 above. 22There can be no doubt about the anthropomorphic features of the pëdang, on which one can clearly distinguish a bearded figure. Such anthropomorphic features are common on the Javanese këris and have been fully described and interpreted by W. H. Rassers, 'Inleiding tot de Bestudering van de Javaansche Kris'. Meded. Kon. Ak. Wet., Afd. Lett., N.R., I, No. 8, 1938, pp. 29-33. There is also a curious engraving of a Nãga on the pëdang , reminding us of Rasse re' emphasis on some significant snake-like affinities of the Javanese këris. For these megaliths in comparison with other antiquities in the area, see Mubin Sheppard, 'Megaliths in Malacca and in Negri Sembilan', Joum. Fed . Mus. VII. (New Series), 1962. pp. 71-85, in particular p. 73 &amp; Plate XI. 23 Evans (art. cit., p. 159), following up a suggestion of Wilkinson, thought that the inscription was put up at a later date. ' I would suggest, therefore', he wrote, 'that the builders of the tomb, followers of the Prophet, made a compromise between their Islamic dislike of pagan monuments and sculptures and their native fear of, and reverence for, pre-Mohammedan holy places, and that they carved the word "Allah" on the Pëdang , in order to sanctify an infidel monument, for which, in spite of their religion, they, or the then inhabitants of the district, 9</page><page sequence="19">J. G. DE CASPARIS JMBRAS, VOL. 53 that the pidang cannot be older than about half a century in comparison with the inscriptions, and could even date back to the same period, viz. the middle of the fifteenth century.24 It should, however, be added that a late date of the pČdang does not imply that all the megaliths at the site belong to the same period. It seems more likely that Kramat Sungai Udang has been an old sacred site to which, in the course of time, other cult objects were added; some of these may have been brought there from elsewhere, as probably happened with the inscribed stele. Only fresh excavations at Kramat Sungai Udang may possibly confirm the proposed interpretation. If not, this matter has to be reconsidered and, quite possibly, one of the other explanations, especially the first or the second, may have to be preferred. There still remains one other basic matter which has to be briefly considered : the presence on the same stone of differently dated inscriptions. This was by no means rare in ancient India; the Girnar rock with the Ašokan edicts, Rudra- daman's inscription of A.D. 150 and Skanda Gupta's inscription of A.D. 455 with additions in 456 and 457, as well as the Allahabad Pillar with inscriptions of Ašoka, Samudra Gupta and Jahângîr are well known examples which require no further comment. There are also examples in Indonesian epigraphy, two of which may be briefly mentioned in this connexion. The so-called stone of Gajah Mada, found at or near the site of the old capital at Singhasari in eastern Java,25 starts with a brief inscription giving the date Šaka 1214, i.e. A.D. 1292, and stating that this was the year of the death of king Krtanagara and his closest associates (as we know from other sources, they were all killed during an unexpected attack by troops from Kadiri). This statement is followed by a full stop (indicated by two small vertical strokes) and then there begins a new date (Šaka 1273 = A.D. 1351) heading an inscription proclaiming the foundation by order of the powerful minister Gajah Mada of a commemorative chapel in honour of Krtanagara and others. It should be noted that the inscription as a whole must have been carved on the latter date, for no difference whatever in the style of writing is noticeable. The brief statement dated 1292 is actually no more than a kind of introduction serving as the direct had still a considerable regard.' Against this view Gullick, (art. cit., p. 55) objects that 'unless the masons who first carved the stones left a convenient blank panel in the middle of their design the carving "Allah" can hardly be a later addition.' I am not sure that this is a strong argu- ment as there may not have been any particular reason to decorate that particular part of the stone. A possibly stronger argument against Evans' view is the fact that the inscription itself is not carved into the stone but stands out in bold relief. In other words, this would imply that this part of the image must have been at a somewhat higher level in its original state. In that case, however, the chin of the figure would have been at the level of its body. This may not be quite impossible but it seems less likely. One has therefore to assume that those who carved the pëdang also carved the letters of the word Allãh. If, indeed, the stone represents a Javanese kris , as suggested in the preceding note, the presence of a somewhat anthropomorphic hilt is not so surprising as Evans thought. 240. W. Wolters, The Fall of Srivijaya in Malay History , London 1970, on the basis of Tomé Pires* account, dated the conversion to Islam of the Malacca court back to shortly after the third ruler's return from China in 1435 (pp. 162 f.), but there would probably have been Muslims in the area well before that date, as there certainly were in Trěngganu. The balance of pro- babilities would, however, be in favour of a date not earlier than the second quarter of the fifteenth century. 10</page><page sequence="20">PART 1, 1980 AHMAT MAJANU'S TOMBSTONE AT PENGKALAN KEMPAS motive for the foundation of 1351. The monument itself is described as a caitya , which suggests that it was not a tomb, nor even a true funerary monument. This is not really surprising. The events leading to Krtanagara's death are fully described in the Pararatan, which establishes that Krtanagara was killed in a massacre following an unexpected assault by rebellious troops from Kadiri. As a consequence Krtanagara's body may have been completely mutilated or it may have disappeared. The use in the inscription of the word lina, 'absorbed, dissolved, disappeared* etc.,26 may be an indication in favour of the latter alter- native. As this clash was soon followed by a Chinese invasion it is likely that no proper funerary service could be carried out at that time. More than half a century later, however, when Krtanagara was remembered and recognized as the spiritual father of the great empire of Majapahit, Gajah Mada ordered the construction of a commemorative chapel at Singhasari. The second example is even more interesting. In 1286 Krtanagara had a large composite statue, representing Amoghapãáa with all his acolythes, shipped to 'Malayu', actually Padang Roco near Sungai Langsat in the upper Batanghari valley of the present province of Jambi. The transfer is mentioned in the Old Malay inscription carved on the (separate) base of the composite statue. This text emphasizes the joy felt by the authorities and the people of 'Malayu' at the arrival of the sculpture.2? More than half a century later, however, in A.D. 1347, Ãdityavarman, the mighty king of 'Malayu', who controlled vast parts of Sumatra from his capital at Pagërruyung in the present province of West Sumatra (Sumatera Barat), had the statue itself taken to Rambahan, leaving the pedestal behind at Padang Roco. The Amoghapãáa was subsequently re-consecrated and given a new sanctuary, as is described in the inscription on the back of the image.28 In this case it is quite clear that the inscriptions on the pedestal and on the back of the statue were written by different hands, at different localities and on different dates. It is interesting to add that Ãdityavarman could have his inscription carved on the back, because this part was quite flat and had been left uninscribed, just as the east and west faces of the Pěngkalan Kěmpas stone had initially been left blank. The Amoghapãáa was apparently meant to be placed against a wall, just as the stele of Pěngkalan Kempas may originally have been part of a wall or gateway. Whatever uncertainty there may still be as far as the conflict leading to Ahmat Majanu's death and the subsequent reappraisal of his part in these events are concerned, it seems to me that at least a few basic points about this important inscribed stone have been cleared up. Before, however, proceeding to the precise reading and interpretation of the Kawi inscription it is necessary to discuss a few points in detail, especially those in which my reading and/or interpretation 25 J. L. A. Brandes, Tjandi Singhasari and P anatar an, 1909, pp. 38 f. and Plate 66, on particular line 14. 26It is perhaps no co- incidence that the word lina is again applied to Kërtanagara in Nägarakir- tãgama 44, 3c. On the other hand, the word is elsewhere used as a synonym of mukta (mokta) as applied to Kërtarâjasa's death recorded in 47, 3a. 27N. J. Krom, Med. Kon. Ak. Wet., Afd.

After that I may raise a few general points about the type of script used in these inscriptions. One of the passages which are of direct importance for the interpretation of the text as a whole is seen in lines A 4 and 5, viz. the words barbuwat daya. Van Stein Callenfels* translation implies that Ahmat Majanu acted 'for some treacherous purpose'. Van Stein Callenfels no doubt thought of expressions such as tipu daya, 'cunning tricks', but the 'tricky' element is rather implied in tipu. In other combinations, such as daya upaya, 'all kinds of means', the word has no clearly unfavourable connotation. The best translation of barbuwat (i.e. bbbuat) daya would therefore be: 'carried out a stratagem', which could have been an act of treason, but could equally well have been an act of bravery. The word daya itself is neutral, while its connotations depend on the context. If the scribe who drafted the text of the inscription had intended to convey the impression that Ahmat had committed treason it is unlikely that he should have used a neutral or ambiguous term; he would probably have chosen durhaka or one of its derivatives, used already in that meaning in the seventh-century inscrip- tions of Šrivijaya.29 If one believes with Winstedt that Ahmat 'died a low death (presumably at the hands of the executioner)',30 it would even be more difficult to understand why Ahmat's behaviour was not expressed by an unambiguous term. On the contrary, immediately after the words barbuwat daya one reads about Ahmat's death which is expressed by the term seda. Van Stein Callenfels, who read this word correctly, connected it with Javanese seda, which is the so- called krámà-inggil term for 'dying'. It is well known that such terms are not just polite, as krámá in general, but are reserved for those to whom one wants to pay special respect. It would be unthinkable that such a term should have been used for a traitor who was not, as far as one can see, of royal blood. Against this line of thought one may perhaps argue that this usage of seda is attested only from the eighteenth century, and there is no proof that it can also be applied to a much earlier period. One has, however, to remember that the word can be traced back to Sanskrit siddha, meaning 'perfect' etc., is therefore certainly pre-Muslim and must always have had a strong honorific connotation.31 If this interpretation of seda is correct it excludes the interpretation of barbuwat daya as implying any kind of treason and strongly suggests that Ahmat's stratagem was directed not against the Sultan but against his enemies. Presumably, the 'princes' ( raja-raja , probably sons and/or relatives of the sultan, possibly, but not necessarily excluding the sultan himself) fell into an ambush, were subse- quently seized (katangkap) by rebels, but then Ahmat Majanu unexpectedly appeared on the road (masuk ke jalan), probably from behind the trees, and saved the princes by his brave action, for which he paid with his life. What 29In the form drohaka it occurs in the inscriptions of Kotakapur (Bangka) and Karangbrahi (Jambi), thus, four times in lines 7 and 8 of the former, see G.

Shortly after these events, in 1463, an inscribed stone, comparable with the hero stones (virakkal) of the Tamilnãdu (Tamil influence was quite strong in mid-fifteenth- century Malaka, as we know from the Sìjarah М21ауи)&gt; was erected at the (un- known) site of the battle. This is the present stone, on which the brave deeds of Ahmat Majanu were described. This memorial stone replaced, to some extent, the tombstone, which would have been placed there in the case of a normal burial. In this context it is also necessary to have a good look at the transcription of В 6 where my reading differs considerably from that given by Van Stein Callenfels. Between the first three syllables, probably to be read as lalagi, although lalaki cannot be excluded, and the word wassalam, which is perfectly clear, there are two aksaras. I may start with the second of these, that which precedes the wa of wassalam . About the letter itself there cannot be any doubt: it is a na, eight other examples of which occur in the inscription. In fact, it is the only aksara provided with two 'eyes' (a term which will be further discussed in the palaeographical section which follows). The letter is, however, provided with an additional stroke starting at the top of the letter. At first it may seem as though the na is provided with a virãma ( patèn in Javanese: the mark indi- cating the absence of a vowel), but a comparison with eight examples of clear viramos (for instance at the end of jalan in В 3) shows that this cannot be the case. In all these examples the virãma is drawn down to below the base line and ends below the aksara to which it is attached. The sign attached to the na of line В 6, however, stops right at the base line. If, for this reason, the reading -n can be excluded, we have to adopt the only other possible alternative by assuming that the mark expresses a long -я. No other examples of the signs for long vowels are found in this inscription, which does not adhere to the convention, attested already in the seventh-century Old Malay inscriptions of Srivijaya, of using long vowels in syllables bearing the word accent (usually the penultima, but not if it is followed by more than one consonant). There must therefore have been a strong motive to deviate from this practice in this particular case. The most plausible motive would be that of spelling non-Malay words as much as possible in accordance with their spelling in the language from which they were borrowed. As to the aksara preceding nã one would at first be inclined to identify it as ya, since the character resembles the second one of line A 5, but yanã yields no sense. There is, however, another possibility. One of the least frequently used letters of the Kawi alphabet is the pha, which is found in only two common words of Sanskrit origin: phala, 'fruit' and Phãlguna (often spelt Phãlguna), 'name of the last month of the luni-solar year'. It is normally expressed as similar to a non-aspirate pa, but broader with a notch in its base line and a slightly 13</page><page sequence="23">J. G. DE CASPARIS J M BRAS, VOL. 53 inward-bending second (rising) vertical.32 Except for the last mentioned detail this is precisely the case with the letter of В 6, which I therefore read as pha . It is well known that modern Indian scripts often use the letter for pha to express the /in words of foreign origin. If, e.g., one uses the word 'football' in Bengali one writes it with a pha at the beginning of the word.33 It therefore seems likely to me that the fourth and fifth aksaras of В 6 have to be read phanã as a correct rendering of the Arabic word fanã. This interpretation would at once explain the use of the long vowel in nã, natural in a word of foreign origin. The term is used in Malay both in the sense of complete disappearance and in that of the mystical state in which the worshipper is completely absorbed in the contemplation of God's majesty and is no longer aware of the visible, nor of the invisible world (Klinkerťs Dictionary). Its meaning corresponds fairly closely to that of Sanskrit lina, which also combines the sense of disappearance with that of com- plete absorption into the all-pervading deity. It is interesting to add that the very word lina is also used in the above-mentioned Singosari inscription concern- ing the foundation of a commemorative chapel in honour of Krtanagara and the others killed at the same time during Jayakatwang's attack.3* Finally, it seems quite plausible that the inscription should end in such auspicious words as fanã and wassalam, just preceding the figures of the date in the last line. In this connexion it is proper to discuss a few other important features of the script of the Kawi inscriptions. After some early attempts by Boden Kloss to identify the letters with the help of a comparison with Thai script35 Van Stein Callenfels rightly pointed out that the script is related with that used in the fourteenth-century inscriptions of Ãdityavarman in central Sumatra.36 The latter can be defined as a regional variety of Old Javanese or Kawi script, but it is not derived from the Javanese script of the end of the thirteenth or the fourteenth century - when the authority of the Java-based empire spread all over the Indo- nesian archipelago and beyond - but of a much earlier period.37 The script of the inscriptions of Ãdityavarman, for which I used the term Malayu script, was apparently used far beyond the area under the direct control of Ãdityavarman for, in the present writer's view, it became the proto-type of later local Suma- tranese scripts such as the Batak, Rejang and Lampung scripts.38 It is also the prototype of the much-discussed Malay inscription of Minye Tujuh on the 32Examples of this Old Javanese form of the pha can be found in K. F. Holle, Tabel van Oud- en Nieuw- Indische Alphabetten , The Hague, Jakarta 1882, p. 14. 33 It is written phutbala in modern Bengali. 3*See abo note 25 above. 35Boden Kloss, art. cit., pp. 187-189. There is, of course, a general similarity with Thai script which, as all the pre- Islamic Malaysian Indonesian and other South East Asian scripts, can be traced back to South Indian Paliava script. Apart from this family likeness there is, however, no particular affinity between the script of Pěngkalan Kěmpas and ancient or modern Thai writing. 3öFor a discussion of the script of the mid- fourteenth- century inscriptions of Ãdityavarman in central Sumatra see the present authors Indonesian Palaeography , Leiden 1976, pp. 56-58. The similarity is by no means confined to some general features but extends to such details as the curiously shaped initial a-.

Instead of the most common method of cutting the letters in the stone, the mason did the opposite by cutting out the stone around the letters. The same method is used in most of the other Muslim inscriptions from the time of the nisãn of Maliku-'s-Salifr of A.D. 1297. This manner of writing is, however, by no means confined to the Muslim tradition, for we find many examples in pre-Muslim Indonesia where this method is, however, mainly confined to short monumental inscriptions. Among the earliest examples are the short inscriptions 899, udayana and mrgayavati at Jalatunda in eastern Java,40 with some longer inscriptions in the Kadiri period. The shapes of the letters written according to this technique are invariably thickened, not rarely to the extent that the separation between the strokes is only symbolically indicated. Letters written in so-called Kadiri Square Script can thus become real puzzles. This is not the case with the Minye Tujuh and Pěngkalan Kempas inscriptions, but there is another difficulty in that the shapes of several aksaras have become modified. A few individual letters may therefore be briefly discussed here. The initial a, which occurs no fewer than six times on the obverse and once more on the reverse, four times of which in the name Ahmat, as it is spelt, can be described as a recumbent half circle, written from right to left (as appears from the little 'eye'), to which, at the height of the 'eye', a little convex half- circle is added, ending on the right-hand side in a small upwards-bçnding stroke. These 'eyes', actually small hollow circles, are a characteristic feature of this inscription. Usually they replace the serifs with which many aksaras begin, but sometimes they develop out of loops such as those at the left bottom of the ma and the na. The former thus assumes a characteristic form with an eye at the top and one at the bottom of the left-hand vertical. As to the latter, its loop at the left-hand bottom also developed into an 'eye', but so did the horizontal bottom stroke; in this case the 'eye* developed out of the downward bend at the end of the aksara as written in the copper-plate inscriptions of the Majapahit period. This development may be due to an aesthetic tendency towards sym- metry. On the other hand, the serif did not lead to a third 'eye* but disappeared altogether. The da resembles the rta but has only a single 'eye' at the right-hand side. Most other akçaras have one 'eye' instead of a serif, written at the spot where one starts to write, i.e. most often at the left top. If, however, the letter starts at the left bottom, as is the case with ba, la and rta, the 'eye' is also placed at the bottom. With the ja, the 'eye' is placed a little below the top, sometimes nearly half-way down. 39See the references given in note 12 above. 40This is, of course, not meant to suggest that there was any direct relationship between the Kadiri Quadrate Script on the one hand and the Minye Tujuh and Pěngkalan Kêmpas inscriptions on the other, although this example shows at least that the technique whereby the letters are, as it were, 'spared out* by chiselling out the surrounding stone was not foreign to the Indonesian tradition of writing. It seems, however, that the direct prototype of this tnanner of writing in stone should be looked for in Arabic writing where it was quite common. 15</page><page sequence="25">S. G. DE CASPARIS JMBRAS, VOL. 53 Three letters which are difficult to distinguish from each other are the ta, the ka and probably the ga. In older Old Javanese script the ta starts on the left-hand side with a large loop of normal aksara height, but already in the eleventh-century inscriptions of Airlanga one sees a clear tendency at starting the beginning of the loop somewhat below the top line, and this tendency becomes much more pronounced in the Singhasari-Majapahit period. In the inscriptions of Ãdityavarman, however, the loop of the ta has become quite small and begins to resemble an 'eye' at the left-hand bottom of the letter. At the same time there develops a small upwards stroke at the right-hand bottom, presumably to avoid confusion with the ga. As to the ka, the development of which is generally parallel with that of the ta,2* it can be understood that the reduction of the loop of the ta and a similar reduction of the middle stroke of the ka tended to reduce also the difference between the two letters. To distinguish the ka from both the ta and the ga the little upward stroke was drawn up to the top line. If, there- fore, my interpretation of these developments is correct the three letters are distinguished by the absence of an additional upward stroke for the ga, the little oblique hook for the ta and the full upward stroke for the ka . While I am reasonably confident about the interpretation of the three above- mentioned aksaras , I have some doubt about another triad, viz. na, ba and ita. In modern Javanese script these three letters all consist of a basic portion, i.e. two disconnected strokes, with no addition for the ña, one additional vertical for the ba and two of the same for the Ha. This development is to some extent foreshadowed in fifteenth-century Majapahit script.14 One wonders whether the same kind of distinction also applies to the Pëngkalan Kempas inscription. There is no doubt about the identification of the ba, which is fairly common; thus, the reading of the word barbuwat in В 4 seems quite certain.43 If, there- fore, one finds the same sign with an additional vertical stroke in В 2 one is fully justified in identifying it as ria. As the preceding word must probably be read milik, a ria would make excellent sense, yielding milikría, 'his property'. But how then is ha written ? The answer may be found in line В 4, After rajar aja one would be inclined to read daban. Both the da and the n with virãma are certain, but if one looks closely at the letter in between one can see that it is not quite identical with at least four examples of unambiguous bas , such as the two in barbuwat. All these show a clear dent in the roundish upper horizontal. The sign in В 4, however, shows no such dent and is also narrower than the clear bas. It should therefore be identified as the only example of ha in this 41 After the early Paliava phase, in which ta was similar to na (from which it is sometimes nearly indistinguishable), the loop of the na becomes quite small or even disappears, whereas that of the ta increases in size, in particular in height. Thus, the ta in Old Javanese Kawi script be- comes closely related with ka , from which it is, however, clearly distinguished by the fact that the middle vertical is, at the bottom, connected with the left-hand vertical stroke, whereas it is detached in the ka. 42Cf., in particular, the inscriptions of Pëçak (Pědukuhan Duku) of A.D. 1486, in which the little hooks, attached to the upper right-hand part of the aksaras are developing into full-fledged verticals, leading to the addition of an extra stroke. ^lhat is, except for the subscribed - и of the second ba, which is missing; see the note to the transcription of this line. 16</page><page sequence="26">PART 1, 1980 AHMAT MAJANU'S TOMBSTONE AT PENGKALAN KEMPAS inscription.44 In that case the three letters together represent the word darían, i.e. denari , 'with', which fits the context very well. It should be added that the inscription does not use a vowel mark to indicate the e (it is not used in e.g. barbuzvat, where one might have expected an e in the first syllable) ; nor does it use consonant ligatures with the exception of the double ssa in wassalam at the end, so that the word was not written dňan. It is interesting to add that both the latter and the spelling dañan are found in the seventh-century Šrivijaya inscriptions. An interesting sign is that used to express the absence of a vowel, i.e. the viräma in Sanskrit and the patèn in Javanese. It is found a number of times in the Pěngkalan Kempas inscriptions and can be described as a bent downward stroke starting at the top line to the right of the aksara to which it is attached and extending to below the left part of the letter. As has been pointed out earlier, the stroke attached to the na in В 6 stops at the base line and cannot therefore be interpreted as a virãma; it must represent an - ã , as argued above. Finally, it may be useful to add a few words about the numerals of B-7. Damais, who made a detailed study of the Old Javanese numerals and, especially in connexion with his study of the Tralaya inscriptions, devoted great attention to fifteenth-century numerals, read the figures, no doubt correctly, as 1385.45 As to the last figure, it cannot be anything else but 5, differing from 4 in that a roundish mark is added at the top. It is quite impossible to read it as 9 in order to make it correspond to the Hijrah year spelt out in words in both inscriptions in Jawi script. The date, preceded by wassalam as it is by swasti in the Old Javanese inscriptions, marks the end of the inscription as a whole. This proves that the text must have begun on the north face and was continued and concluded on the south face. After this lengthy preliminary discussion I may now proceed to the transcrip- tion and translation of the Kawi inscription. As the reader will see, the present attempt does not solve all the difficulties, Several passages still remain obscure or uncertain. The hare started by Boden Kloss, as this scholar put it, has not yet been caught. I hope that this discussion may encourage others to proceed further on the road towards the solution of the still remaining problems. The inscription is of great importance as it constitutes one of the few authentic data in a decisive period of the Malaka sultanate and of South East Asian history as a whole.

Van Stein Callenfels thought that they might constitute a chronogram, but did not elaborate this point. Such a chronogram at the beginning of the text would have to correspond to the date expressed in numerals in В 7. The word buta could mean 'five' ( panca mahãbhãtãni, 'the five great elements'), but buka, 'open', does not suggest 'eight' but 'nine* ( rtava-dvãra , 'the nine openings of the body'). I have been unable to recognize other words with numerical value. On the other hand, if the words do not constitute a chronogram, what could they mean? Much depends on the correct reading, which is not beyond doubt. The first letter is clearly da despite the loss of the upper part of the letter. It is followed by what seems to be a ra , but a comparison with the two ras of raja-raja in В 4 shows that the top of the letter in A 2 is more elaborated. This could mean that ri was intended. In that case the text begins with the word dari, which further suggests that the next word is a place name. This seems the most likely view at the present stage. The last letter of the line is probably ta, but ga and ka are other possibilities as the three are very similar, as has been pointed out in the palaeographic note at the end of the introduction. 3: the second aksara resembles the da as written in Old Javanese Kawi script. It also resembles the y a of line A 5, from which it is, however, distinguished by the inward-bending rising vertical stroke. If the thick dot at the right top of the letter is not part of the ta, it could be an anusvãra, used to render the n at the end of a word or a syllable. This sign can also be used to render the homorganic nasal, if the next aksara is a plosive. In that case, the word as a whole would be tartda, which would make sense in this context. The rest of the line raises no problems. For the na see the palaeographic introduction. 18</page><page sequence="28">PLATE 7. Kazoi Inscription : North side. PLATE 8.

In Old Javanese Kawi, as in all or most of the Indian scripts, the mark is placed over the aksara which it precedes, whereas in Modern Javanese over that which it follows. In this respect, therefore, our inscription marks a transitional phase. - Although the reading is clearly barbawat there can be no doubt that barbuwat or barbuat, corresponding to modern berbuat, was intended. Could the omission of the -u be due to the following wa ? If the scribe normally used Arabic scribt, where the word is written ^ , the mistake is understandable. - As to the -u of majanu, which is not as clear as that found in A7 and B3 in the same name, it is probably the dot visible on the stone just to the right of the upper part of the da in the next line - if the reading is indeed seda (not sadang). - Finally it may be useful to repeat that ahmat is consistently spelt with a - 1 in accordance with Malay and Indonesian pronunciation; the Jawi inscriptions, on the other hand, use the correct Arabic spelling throughout. 5 : I have followed Van Stein Callenfels in reading seda, the modern Javanese for 'dying1 if applied to people of very high social standing (brama inggil). Etymologically the form is derived from Sanskrit and Old Javanese siddha, 'perfect' etc. The reading may not be completely beyond doubt. As one can see on the photograph, the rising stroke of what has been read as a sa is somewhat, but not unrecognizably, damaged, but in front of the letter one can see two slanting strokes. Either or both of these must be a punctuation mark. As the second stroke seems to touch (or almost so) the first vertical of the sa it is more likely that only the first stroke is a punctuation mark. As, moreover, sada makes no sense, one has further to interpret the mark to the right of the upper part of the da as an anusvãra, i.e. final -ng, instead of a subscript - и attached to the na of the preceding line. The word sadang could represent sedang, 'while', etc. but does not seem to fit the context; therefore, on balance, I think that Van Stein Callenfels' reading seda is the most probable one. If, then, we accept this reading, it has important implications. First of all, it confirms our impression of strong Javanese influence in mid-fifteenth-century Malaka. Secondly, it may, in that case, suggest a satisfactory interpretation of the words pada alah in A 8. Thirdly, the use of a term used as brama inggil in Javanese would be completely out of place if applied to some-one accused of having betrayed his lord. 6. It is likely that pwan means peremption, 'woman', as Van Stein Callenfels suggested, especially as also a son or daughter (anak) is mentioned in the same line. In that case, Balat and Sadang would be the names of Ahmat's wife and son (or daughter) respectively. 7. The reading of the second part of this line is quite difficult. The letter following majanu is smaller than the others, presumably because the na 19</page><page sequence="31">J. G. DE CÀSPÀRIS JMBRAS, VOL. 53 of the preceding line prevented the scribe from drawing the letter up to its normal height. The reading of the aksara is somewhat uncertain but, on account of the two relatively large circular serifs, ma is most likely. The next letter is almost certainly another ma, followed by a la. As to the last letter with its clear upward stroke at the end, one would be inclined to read ta, but it is difficult to see what that could mean. A ka would, of course, yield malaka, the name of the state and the capital, which does not, however, fit the context. As a term meaning 'fought* would make sense, especially in connexion with pada alai} in the next line, one could consider the reading malaga . The fact that the word, especially in the form berlaga, is mainly applied to animals in the modern language need not be an objection, as the word has a more general meaning in Old Java- nese. 8. No comment. В 1. In Arabic script. 2. No comment. 3. The correct reading seems to be ki, but the context requires ke (or ka). It is likely that the vowel mark for medial ~i is used to render the -e. Else- where, however, no vowel mark is used in places where one expects -e, e.g. in the first syllables of partama (B 2), barbuwat (A 4), danari (В 4), katangkap (В 5) and lalagi (В 6). I cannot see any reason why a different method was followed in the case of the monosyllabic word ke. 4. The reading of ba at the end of the line is not doubtful but its meaning is by no means clear as tun, not batun, is known as a title. The most likely explanation is that ba, like the first ma in A 7, is due to a mistake by the stone-cutter. What could have happened is that the latter, follow- ing his example on which the words deňan tun bar ah were written, initially forgot the title tun, but realized his mistake after writing ba. As he had no means to erase the ba he just left it where it stood and went on with the correct words tun barah. 5. The correct reading is apparently talang, not kalang, for the first of these two aksaras ends in the rising 'hook* characteristic of ta. It therefore seems unlikely that the name Kalang, i.e. the town of Kelang, presumably part of a title, is mentioned here. On account of what has been noted with reference to the ga in the note to A 7 some reservation is, however, necessary. 6. On my reading of phanã cf. the Introduction. 7. The figures of the date, too, are discussed in the Introduction. 20</page><page sequence="32">&lt;3 I £ § .a •SJ § s a « J •S a, "■5Ì /♦o § -N **&gt; Vj E4 *^&gt; t^o Jl. *&gt; ?3 ."^ ö ^ ö "Й « ^ « s * ■S ^ • ^ *-* 'г* fed ^ S ^ CO tì .8 ^ F- i *"" *&gt; &lt; &lt;3 ** J &lt;*5 '"t^. ® CL « ® &lt;; -к* • *** * &lt;Ъ Ô 'S ^ "S Jî ^3 "§ ^3 « 55 » s 55 » *«i «♦«a oj « *» cq «ï; *» V Sì о Î</page><page sequence="33">PART 1, 1980 AHMAT MAJANU'S TOMBSTONE AT PENGKALAN KEMPAS Translation: A.

General Note In discussing the present inscription it may be useful to add a few words about the manner in which inscriptions, such as that under consideration, may have been prepared. It seems that at least three stages were involved. First of all the king or a high official acting in his name issued an order, by mouth rather than in writing, stipulating all the basic details. The royal order subse- quently passed down the official hierarchy till it was received by a secretary, called citralekha in the Old Javanese inscriptions, whose duty it was to draft the precise text of the order in accordance with law, tradition and precedents. He subsequently wrote the text down in such a manner that the stone-cutter, who was essentially a craftsman, would have no difficulty in carving the text into the stone designated for that purpose. The secretary may first have written out the text on palm leaves (lontar) but there is little doubt that at least in some cases he traced the shapes of the letters of the inscription on the stone with paint or with a piece of chalk. This is probably what is called ripto-pala ('rubbed stone') in some inscriptions. In the final stage the stone-cutter reproduced all the letters of the example on the stone. Normally the technique used by the stone-cutter amounted to cutting the shapes of the letters into the stone by using a small chisel. In some cases, however, a different technique was used, espe- cially for relatively brief monumental inscriptions: instead of cutting out the shapes of the letters, the stone-cutter chiselled out the space around the letters which, in this manner, came to stand out in relief. This technique had the great advantage that the inscription would be less liable to becoming illegible after many years when the stone became weather-beaten. On the other hand, how- ever, the letters written in this manner were invariably thickened and usually more or less stylized. This may create special problems of interpretation espe- cially as most inscriptions written in this manner were short or very short, thus providing only limited materials for comparison. This indeed is the principal problem facing the historian in the present inscription. 21</page><page sequence="34">J. G.
