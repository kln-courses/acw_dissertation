<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Implications of Recent Points of View in Physics 1 by P. W. Bridgman Professor C. I. Lewis suggested to Professor Lameere that there might be a certain interest for European readers of the Revue Internationale de Philosophie if I prepared a statement of some of the points of view which I have already discussed in various American writings. The invitation of Professor Lameere to do this I am happy to accept. These points of view had their origin in the attempt to understand and to generalize the methods by which physicists had successfully met the conceptual crisis brought about by the discovery in the early years of this century of new experimental facts in the domains of relativity and quantum phenomena. The crisis was met only by the adoption of an attitude so radically novel that for many years the older generation of physicists could see "in it only paradox and self contradiction. The essence of the new attitude reveals itself most plainly from an analysis of what Einstein did in his special theory of relativity. Although it is not by any means the whole story, a vital part of the foundation of the special theory of relativity is to be found in the realization by Einstein that a part of the appearance of paradox is a consequence of an uncritical attitude toward the meaning of the terms which we had used in describing the experimental results. Our meanings had been naive, whereas the experimental situation proved, when instrumental refinement was carried beyond a certain point, too complex to be described in such naive \ Nous publions dans ce numéro l'article que le Professeur Bridgman n'a pu, ayant été malade, nous envoyer pour le numéro 8, consacré à la Philosophie scientifique.</page><page sequence="2">480 P. W. BRIDGMAN terms. Familiar concepts like length and time proved complex when a careful analysis was made. The method which disclosed the complexity was an analysis of what we do when we measure the length of discrete objects or the time of concrete events. It turned out that there were recognizably different procedures for measuring the length or the times of events which we had previously assumed uncritically were measured by a single unique procedure, and that it made a vital difference which of these procedures was used in descri bing the phenomena as simply as possible in the new domain of high velocities. That is, Einstein recognized that such apparently simple concepts as length and time have multiple meanings, so that there are different kinds of length, for example optical length and tactual length, and that the precise meaning involves the procedure used in obtaining lengths or times in concrete instances. This attitude toward meanings is what I have called " operational I first expounded it at considerable length in a book published in 1927 and have expanded or modified it in various writings 1 since. The thesis is that I do not know the meaning of a term unless I can give an " oper ational " account of it. This means, if the term is one with concrete application, that I be able to tell what I do in deter mining in any concrete situation that the term is applicable, or that I be able to reconstruct what it was that my neighbor did in selecting the term to describe the concrete situation to me. Although this operational aspect of meanings is only a partial aspect, it is in many situations perhaps the most important aspect, and in a society with a sufficiently homo geneous background it is often all that we need concern our selves with. This remark applies to meaning in its two modes. If I alone am concerned, experience shows that an operational analysis gives the precision, articulateness and stability to my concepts that I" need in discussing situations with myself. On the other hand, if it is a question of communication, it is obvious that if two members of society agree on their 1 The Logic of Modern Physics, Macmillan, New-York, 1927; — The Nature of Physical Theory, Princeton University Press, 1936; — The Intel ligent Individual and Society, Macmillan, New-York, 1938; — Operational Analysis (Phil, of Sci., 5, 114-131, 1938); — Some General Principles of Operational Analysis (Psych. Rev., 52, 246-249 and 281-284, 1946).</page><page sequence="3">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 481 operational description of the meaning of a term there will be no confusion in their communication of meaning. In a given setting, the operational analysis of meanings plays a potent part in ensuring clarity and may be made an important tool. In physics it is proving most useful, and I think few physicists would now be satisfied unless their terms were defined in a way that is essentially operational, whether or not they would apply this word in characterizing the defi nition. It is my belief that an analysis of the meanings of concepts in terms of operations can be made equally fruitful in other fields also. Certain general comments may be made on operational analysis. Initially, the analysis into operations must be made as articulately and completely as possible. The operations back of a concept must at first be uniquely specified and only such operations must be used as can be uniquivocally per formed in the situations in question. A concept defined by two sets of operations, although the experimental evidence may be that these two sets of operations lead to identical results, must at first be classified as two concepts. The reason for insisting on meticulous attention to distinctions of this sort is that experience has shown that it is not safe to neglect them. All experimental procedure is fringed with error; two procedures can never be shown to be equivalent except within a certain margin of error; when the range of experience widens two different procedures which were hitherto equivalent within error may become recognizably different. It was this that happened in the domain of relativity phenomena at high velocities. By a meticulous insistence on uniqueness of formulation a repetition of the relativity crisis may be avoided. Not only has experience in physics yielded the conviction that a unique specification is the only safe specification, but it has gone further in yielding the active expectation that when old ranges are greatly exceeded it is the rule that formerly equivalent procedures will yield divergent results. The presence of an operational component in any analysis of concepts seems to me to be a simple result of observation and not to be a matter for argument. It is doubtless more usual to attempt an analysis in terms of objects of the external world or in terms of fixed and static elements</page><page sequence="4">482 P. W. BRIDGMAN of other sorts. But when I ask myself what I mean when I say that objects exist, or that there is an external world, the only answer that I can give is in terms of activities of one sort or another. Any analysis of meanings into specific operations or activities is obviously not an ultimate analysis, as indeed no analysis is or can be. We require of any analysis that it be one which for the purpose in hand and in the particular context is adequate. Whether any specific analysis will be adequate or profitable can usually be decided only on the basis of a considerable experience. Any specific analysis cannot attempt to penetrate beyond a certain point; that is, in a certain context, certain operations are to be accepted as unanalyzed. For instance, in special relativity theory the operation of judging the coincidence of an event with the position of the hand of a clock, that is, the operation of determining the " local " time of an event, is assumed to be an operation that all observers can perform intuitively, unequivocally, and with the same result, and is therefore unanalyzed. It is obvious enough that no finality or rigor or certainty can inhere in any breakdown of operations into those which are " intuitively " performable. I have no method of ensuring the " same " operation as my neighbor except imita tion or observation or description, and none of these can have any assurance of definitiveness. It must be sufficient for us that in many situations it proves that there are simple operations intuitively performable adequately adapted to our purposes. There is no way of predicting what these opera tions are, and no way of knowing when we have found them except the check offered by an extensive experience. Opera tional analysis, without a vitalizing experience, is formal and empty. It makes no pretense to go to the " bottom " of things. It may seem to many that it is unsatisfactory to leave the fundamental operations unanalyzed and intuitive, but that some definition of the operations which are accepted as fundamental should be attempted. It seems to me that there are dangers in this. For how shall an operation be defined? Either in terms of other operations, in which case we have side stepped the issue, or else in terms of its properties. The latter brings back all the difficulties that we are trying to avoid, because the proof that a certain operation has certain</page><page sequence="5">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 483 properties can never be given except with a margin of exper imental uncertainty, so that we can never be sure that when precision is pushed to new limits it will not appear that operations with such properties do not exist. This was exactly the situation that arose with regard to the Newtonian definitions of absolute space and time that touched off the whole relativity development. I believe that the indefiniteness involved in accepting intuitive operations as our unanalyzed is unavoidable. It is by no means necessary that the operations chosen as fundamental for the analysis be physical operations with physical instruments, as is sometimes mistakenly stated. For obviously the activity of the experimenter in dealing with a physical situation, or more generally with other situations in which concepts are used with definable meanings, is not an activity which can be exhaustively described in physical terms, but there is necessarily a " mental " component. It is only necessary that the components of mental activity be described in such terms that the subject or his fellow can uniquely reproduce them on demand. It is not profitable to attempt an exhaustive classification of the non-instrumental or " mental " operations. One very broad group of these may, however, be specially considered, namely those which are used by the theoretical physicist in putting his theories in mathematical form. A large part of the mathematical activity of the theoretical physicist is concerned with the manipu lation of his mathematical symbols on paper, and we shall accordingly speak of " paper and pencil " operations as suggestive of this whole class of non-instrumental operations. Now at one time or another some physicists have expressed the idea that all paper and pencil operations are eventually reducible to instrumental operations. It seems to me that there is no acceptable argument as to why this should be necessary or desirable, and I believe that observation shows that theoretical physicists do profitably employ concepts which can in no way be reduced to instrumental operations. Quantum mechanics is full of examples; the psi function is one of the simplest. It is perhaps not at first evident why an operational analysis of meanings is of value or what its value is. The value is, I think, to be found in the fact that it enables us to</page><page sequence="6">484 P. W. BRIDGMAN see more clearly whether we are likely to attain the purposes we have in view. Our experience has shown that certain procedures are useful for attaining certain purposes and that other procedures are not useful or are actually harmful. If the " good " procedures are used in forming our concepts, then we may anticipate success, whereas if we find that " bad " procedures are involved we will do well to modify our concepts. Furthermore, actual analysis discloses that in many instances we had made unconscious assumptions about the nature of the procedures we were using; we had assumed that they were " good " procedures without taking the trouble to find what the procedures actually were; whereas when we make the analysis we find that they were " bad " procedures. This was the situation with regard to the concepts of length and time before Einstein made his analysis. Here again there is no getting away from the appeal to experience, which alone is capable of telling whether in the context of a given purpose any specific procedure is " good " or " bad With this brief exposition of what is involved in the operational method I now turn to a consideration of some of the results of its application in actual situations. In any actual applications the first task is to find what are the operations which in the given context are treated as unan alyzed. In the context of the ordinary situations of daily life it will be found, I think, that these unanalyzed operations are to a surprisingly large extent purely verbal. Usually, of course, any simple term is used in a given situation with confidence, with no attempt at justification of the propriety of using the term, and with no consciousness that justification is required. If the necessity for justification appears, so that some form af analysis is forced on one, it will be found I think that often one makes a very simple sort of verbal experiment to assure himself that the term was correctly used. Execution of the verbal experiment constitues the operation that in this case gives the meaning. This verbal experiment consists simply in saying to oneself : " would I say thus and thus in such and such a situation ? " The asking of the question gives the pause for a somewhat higher degree of self consciousness in appraising the situation, and the answer is usually given with confidence without any attempt at exhaustive analysis of what the precise character of the situation may be. Fur</page><page sequence="7">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 485 thermore, one usually feels assurance that one's neighbor would give the same answer to the verbal experiment, and when one has the consciousness of potential corroboration by one's neighbor the issue of the meaning of the term is regarded as disposed of and not thought of further. The underlying situation is obviously exceedingly complex here. Conscious ness of potential corroboration by one's neighbor involves a background of common culture and language which it would be hopeless to attempt to analyze exhaustively, but there is no doubt that in practise human beings can and do act in this way. One may attempt to push the analysis a step further by asking what are the meanings of the terms used in characteri zing the situation as " such and such " in our verbal experiment. This situation may often be " objectively " char acterized in some way or another, but it may also be a situation which is itself characterized only in verbal terms, for instance, a situation created by a statement or a question from my neighbor. The analysis can obviously be pushed indefi nitely, step by step. I think our experience shows, in the case of those concepts which ostensibly deal with the external world, that we require that our analysis of meaning must eventually emerge into contact with 4he external world, so that we can free ourselves from the verbal encumbrance. We demand of our terms in physics, for example, that this eventual objective emergence be possible. Whether such emergence actually occurs cannot in general be told until the analysis has been made. Thus the concepts of absolute spacc and absolute time of Newton proved not capable of emergence beyond the verbal, whereas the local time and optical length of Einstein do thus emerge. Analysis discloses, I believe, that many of the terms of daily life are incapable of being made to emerge into the " objective ", but that they are part of open verbal chains. It is our naive expectation that objective emergence is possible in many cases where analysis shows that it is not. One value of an operational analysis consists in the discovery of our mistaken expectation. This holds preeminently for many of the terms of conventional philosophy and religion, such as " being " and " reality " and " God ". Man, in the course of his intellectual development, has</page><page sequence="8">480 P. W. BRIDGMAN erected verbal structures of almost inconceivable complexity, and these structures have come to be just as truly a part of the human environment as the physical environment. In the verbal environment man exhibits patterns of behavior which have a definiteness, uniformity, and stability sufficient to give them social value. Man can adapt himself to his fellow man by the use of concepts whose unanalyzed operations are exclusively verbal. It does not seem surprising that this should be possible in view of man's long verbal history. Neither is it impossible that the character of the verbal back ground should be such that concepts which can be analyzed only into verbal operations should nevertheless be applicable to the objective external environment. This doubtless occurs, and furthermore a verbal analysis of an objective situation may often be suggestive, but we can feel no security in a situation such as this, and we usually do demand, when we stop to think about it, that we be able to get away from open verbal chains when dealing with the external world. We certainly make this demand in our science. In spite of the inconceivable complexity of our verbal structures, all our language and also our thinking operates under a universal restriction, namely we strive to employ in our thinking only terms with fixed and static meanings, analogous to the objects of the external world. Yet to the most untutored observation talking and thinking are contin ually evolving activities; tomorrow we talk about what we were talking about yesterday and the objects of our discourse are continually creating themselves. With our blunt intel lectual tools the everlasting wonder is not that we have as much trouble with language and thought as we do, but that we can get along as well as we do. The first result of an operational analysis is usually not to bring simplification, but complexity. We discover that most of our concepts as used in daily life are actually multiple and that different sets of defining operations are used indis criminately. Otherwise expressed, most of our common concepts are over-defined. From the point of view of a methodology that seeks to attain the maximum precision the undesirability of this is obvious. We must insist, at first, on uniqueness in our operational definitions. But in daily life exactly the opposite point of view prevails, and those concepts</page><page sequence="9">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 487 survive as useful which have a number of approximately equivalent operational definitions applicable in a range of circumstances. In daily life the point of view of relativity theory that there are different kinds of length, for instance, such as tactual and optical, is often repudiated, and it is stated that the concept " length " comprises that which is common in all those situations to which the term length in any opera tional sense is applied. This is a possible attitude, but. it may be an unprofitable attitude and it is fraught with danger, for later new knowledge may show that there is nothing common in the various situations which is worth emphasizing. Our growing appreciation of the complexity of the physical world leads to a feeling of the greater profitableness of striving for the greatest precision rather than the greatest inclusiveness in our concepts. Since meanings are in our control, it is conceivable that we might find it desirable sometimes to give a term a multiple meaning deliberately, that is, if this can be done without leading to self contradiction in any conceivable circumstance. This possibility affords a method of dealing with some of the conventional questions of philosophy different from the usual. For instance, we may reply to the question " Do objects continue to exist in the absence of any perceiving mind? " by saying " You may say that objects continue so to exist if you find it convenient to say so ". But,-if we find it convenient to say so, we must recognize that we have thereby chosen to give a multiple operational meaning to " exist ", one meaning which holds when there is a perceiving mind present and one when there is not. It is not at once evident, however, that it is possible to so give a multiple operational meaning to " exist " without ever getting into contradiction. The disco very of whether such contradiction is ever possible constitutes, I believe, the only profit to be found in a serious discussion of the original question. Turning now from this general consideration of what we find when we examine meanings of the terms of daily life, let us consider more particularly what we find when we analyze our scientific concepts, especially those of the physical sciences. Perhaps the most striking result of this analysis, as already intimated, is that we never find simplicity, but as we push our analysis further we encounter ever greater</page><page sequence="10">488 P. W. BRIDGMAN complication. Any apparent simplicity turns out to be the result of human construction. The validity of all such construction must be suspect when we invade new domains. In fact, one of the chief purposes of an operational analysis is to recover the complexities of the primitive situation, and it is one of its chief virtues that it is able to. When we make this analysis we find that the character of the world gets continually hazier as we push our analysis further, and that certainty and definiteness are the illusions of a comparatively early stage of the analysis. We are capable only of a spiral ling approximation, and there is no method of assurance that the process will ultimately be even convergent. The stage of the greatest illusion of certainty is the stage at which we are content with an analysis of the external world into material objects, which we think of as having a permanence in themselves and whose changing relations to each other in time determine experience. This analysis into individual and permanent objects is one which our thinking processes exploit to the greatest possible extent, and we are not confortable in our thinking unless we have managed so to make our constructs that they can be handled like the things of ordinary experience. But the world is too complicated to permit forcing into so straight a mold, even in the situations of physics. It seems to me that physics is recognizably still attempting to operate with some concepts contaminated with a spurious reification. For instance, the energy concept is handled as though energy were a thing, whereas analysis dis closes that the only operations in terms of which energy receives its meaning involve two states of a system plus the process by which the system is transferred from one state to the other. It isa consequence that it is improper to speak of the energy of a single state of a system as one could if energy were like a thing. This improper view of the nature of energy has obscured much of the discussion of Einstein's celebrated mass energy relation, and has also resulted in a good deal of meaningless speculation about energy being one of the two primary constituents of the universe, the other being " matter ". Other concepts of physics which I believe have not yet thrown off the shackles of a false reification are of light, or radiation in general, as being a thing travelling, or</page><page sequence="11">HECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 489 of the " field " as something independent of the operations of the definition which generated it. The analysis of the external world into objects is one which for all purposes of common sense may be accepted as ultimate, in fact one definition of the realm of common sense might be the realm in which objects are accepted as unan alyzables. But, as always, it is possible to push the analysis further and ask what we mean when we say that this or that is truly an object. And, as always, it is possible to give an answer of sorts in this case by saying that we are dealing with an object when certain aggregates of the sense impres sions of ourselves and our fellows have certain attributes of universality and permanence. This analysis which carries us beyond the object, is an analysis into activities or happenings, and in order to make this analysis we have to be able to recognize the activity or the happening as itself identifiable and endowed with the ability to recur. How we are able to do this is a further story which need not concern us now, but that we do it is shown by simple observation. The reproach of solipsism has sometimes been imputed to this point of view with regard to objects, but it seems to me that this rests on a misconception. It is not the same to say " objects do not exist except in my mind " as to ask what we mean when we say " objects exist ". Perhaps the most deeply entrenched of all the positions maintained by the cult of reification is with respect to the nature of numbers. It is almost universal to think of numbers in the Platonic sense as being in many respects like things, each with its own individuality and identity, and such that it is meaningful to say that this or that number " exists This in his recent book Bertrand Bussell says that it is certain that numbers " exist " which have never been thought of by any one. This almost universal Platonic way of thinking about numbers it seems to me is a very close analogue of the common sense way of thinking about abjects. Just as in the case of objects it is possible to carry the analysis beyond common sense, so in the case of numbers it is possible to carry the analysis beyond Plato. From this point of view it is a deeper and truer description of the nature of a number to say it is something that we do that may be repeated rather than to Sciy it is a thing. It seems to me that operational analysis</page><page sequence="12">490 P. W. BRIDGMAN demands this view of the nature of a number. If we adopt this point of view, certain consequences follow. Perhaps the most important are with respect to the infinite processes which form the subject matter of much of " Mengenlehre From the point of view of operations, and this means operations actually carried out or performable, an " infinite " process can only mean a process which is specified in such a way that the process is non-self-terminating. An infinite number is a certain aspect of what one does when he embarks on carrying out a process formulated in this way, that is, an infinite number is an aspect of a program of action. From this point of view it does not make sense to speak of infinite numbers as " existing " in the Platonic sense, and still less does it make sense to speak of infinite numbers of different orders of infinity, as does Cantor. In developing the Cantorian point of view the " diagonal Verfahren " f&lt;Sr proving the non denumerability of the transcendental numbers plays a funda mental role. But is the proof by the method of the diagonal process cogent? Many mathematicians aggressively maintain that there can be no doubt of the validity of this proof, whereas others do not admit it. I personally cannot see an iota of appeal in this proof, but it appears to me to be a perfect non sequitur — my mind will not do the things that it is obviously expected to do if this is indeed a proof. But I can see that if I had the Platonic concept of numbers and in particular of the infinite numbers as of something already existing with individuality and identifiability, that then my mind would make the steps that it is expected to and I would emerge with the conviction of proof. A somewhat similar situation occurs for me with regard to the paradoxes of Zeno. No formulation of these paradoxes has ever been able to give me the feeling of paradox, but I can see that if I literally thought of a line as consisting of an assemblage of points and of an interval of time as the sum of moments without duration, paradox would then present itself. In general, paradox can be felt only in a context of presuppositions, usually unconscious, and simil arly proof is not a completely formal, mechanical, automatic affair, but it demands a background which may be as complex as the whole content of a culture. Here is conceivably a method of analysis for the unexpressed presuppositions of</page><page sequence="13">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 491 various systems of thought, namely by studying the conditions under which proof or paradox is felt. This matter of the diagonal proof and the nature of numbers indicates that the extent to which we push our analy sis is not entirely in our control, although we have spoken of pushing our analysis to one or anothèr point depending on our purposes. The extent to which the analysis is pushed is also to a certain extent a matter of vision, for once having caught a vision one cannot always forget it, no matter what the purpose of the moment. The feeling of paradox or of proof which may be the accompaniment of a less extensive vision can never be recovered once the wider vision has been seen. I believe that it involves a wider vision to think of the objects of the external world in terms of groups of activities rather than in terms of common sense, or to think of numbers as something that we do rather than in Platonic terms, and that once having seen the wider vision we find that there are things which we can no longer do with our minds. Repudiation of the diagonal process and the orders of infinity of Cantor at the same time eliminates the paradoxes conventionally associated with " Mengenlehre ". Indeed, adoption of the operation view towards concepts automatically removes paradox or inner contradiction. For any conceptual situation reduced to operational terms becomes a description of an actual occurrence, and actual occurrences are not contradictory. Contradiction is always our work, and we can encounter it only when we are mistaken about what we think we are doing. A. personal note may be added to these remarks about " Mengenlehre ". In 1934 I published the paper entitled A Physicist's Second Reaction to Mengenlehre in which I described the change in my personal attitude since my first contact with the subject 30 years before. This first contact was that of youth, in which I found the Cantorian analysis stimulating and convincing, whereas my return to the subject 30 years later, after acquiring the operational point of view from my experience in physics, had found me unable to feel any cogency in the accepted proofs or even any meaning in some of the conventional concepts. In that paper I indicated in detail how a number of the paradoxes disappear in the new conceptual atmosphere. The reception which that paper</page><page sequence="14">492 P. W. BRIDGMAN received was a surprise and a disappointment, for it produced no appreciable effect, being dismissed by one school of mathe maticians as being " essentially sound but very naive " and dismissed by the other school as without appreciation of what constitutes mathematics. With this, I dropped all concern with the matter for a number of years, being occupied in the laboratory, and returned to it for a third time only a couple of years ago, stimulated by a lecture from a visiting well known mathematician who referred to the proof of the diagonal process as universally accepted and admitted to be sound beyond the peradventure of a doubt. I thereupon attempted to reexamine the whole matter, and in this enlisted the help of discussions with a colleague who is a professional logician of high standing and who also thought the diagonal proof sound. After the exchange of several long letters we reached agreement at least to the extent of both seeing that the diagonal proof is a proof only in the context of the Platonic concept of the nature of number. I think my colleague still does not accept the idea of numbers as something we do rather than as things. At the same time I was able to understand a little better why the ordinary mathematician clings to his Platonic concept of numbers. He does this because he is not interested primarily in rigor, but rather in fruitfulness. He is interested in doing things and in getting results, and the Platonic concept, leading to infinities of different orders, has proved stimulating and fruitful. The fact that paradox also occurs is indeed unpleasant, but is regarded as probably not too great a price to pay for the richness of the results. This is a perfectly understandable situation, but I think that the mathematician who has once seen a number as something that we do will not be able to go back to the Platonic concept, and will eventually find how to reformulate in the new framework those of the old results which have validity, and at the same time avoid the old paradox. One other aspect of the mathematics which we use in our physical theories may be mentioned in addition tho the nature of numbers. This is that in mathematics there is nothing corresponding to the margin of error which fringes all our knowledge and description of the external world. No physical measurements can be made with a precision beyond a few decimal places, whereas in mathematics there is no bound</page><page sequence="15">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 493 to the decimals that may be heaped up or to the largeness or the smallness of the numbers that we manipulate. This is enough to reveal mathematics as palpably our tool and construction, not reproducing with complete success the obvious structure of the world to which we wish to apply it. With this recognition it is fatuous to think of the role of mathematics in such terms as did Jeans, for example, who could exclaim " God is a Mathematician Mathematics is often reduced to logic; does the operational view have anything to say about the nature of logic? I believe that not only it does, but that it essentially alters our entire attitude toward logic, particularly our feeling that we have here something completely precise and sharp, perhaps because it is purely " formal To see what is involved, consider the syllogism in its conventional form : " If all a is b, and all b is c, then all a is c ". It springs to the eye that the syllogism has a strong operational component, for these are not just static marks on paper, but they have an order, without which the syllogism is meaningless. The conclusion follows from the premises. The marks on paper direct us in a succession of operations which have to be performed in time. Furthermore, the symbols of the syllogism have a context of meaning, and unless they have this context the syllogism is indeed an empty array of marks on paper. In particular, the symbols each occur twice in the syllogism; this implies that at the very minimum the context must be such that the symbol " a ", for instance, stands for the same thing the second time that it occurs as the first. This implies the existence of some method by which it may be determined that it does indeed stand for the " same " thing on both occurrences» Furthermore, the implication is that this is not an empty requirement, but that there are indeed things of which it makes sense to say that they remain the sàme during the discourse. But what sort of a thing is it of which this may be said? Is it the objects of every day life? These do indeed appear to casual inspection to have an identity and to remain the " same ", but physics tells us that every material object is continually emitting and receiving radiation, and that its energy content continually fluctuates, even in the idealized state at absolute zero of temperature. Since the energy content must be reckoned as part of the object, it</page><page sequence="16">494 P. W. BRIDGMAN appears when we push our analysis far enough that objects with identity are not encountered in experience. Or is it the things that we do that have identity and permanence? Can we do the same thing twice? We have assumed that we can, and this assumption has played a fundamental role in our formulation of the operational method. But when we push our analysis far enough, we see that we never do the same thing twice, for time has passed between performances, and my clock reads differently on the second doing. When we speak of doing the same thing twice we are isolating a piece of experience from the rest, and there is no procedure for making the isolation sharp. It would appear, then, that the requirement of " same ness " implied in the syllogism is a requirement that cannot be met sharply, but with only a degree of approximation. How good must the approximation be to permit use in the syllogism? The answer is not obvious, for many a paradox has occurred because the approximation which at first was assumed good enough in actuality was not. Is there any other answer than that the approximation is good enough if the syllogism gives a correct result when used according to the assumption? In any event, whether or not an answer can be found, what has become in such a setting of the " certainty " which was thought to inhere in the operations of logic? If the syllogism is to have content, then in every concrete application there must be some method of verifying the correctness of the conclusion. With this necessary back ground of potential operations of verification it seems to me that it is a misrepresentation to speak of the syllogism, or of logic in general, as having only formal content. The possibility of verification would seem to imply the possibility of getting to the same terminus by two different paths; the syllogism provides one method of getting to the terminus, and the process of verification implies a second path. The second path implies some factual element and is not purely " formal The larger context in which the syllogism has meaning and significance is not purely formal. There is another aspect of the conclusion of the syllogism which I think is important. We assent to the conclusion. The syllogism is something to be understood, as well as a piece of mental machinery by which we can grind out correct</page><page sequence="17">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 495 answers. Understanding the syllogism means that we recog nize that the conclusion " must " follow from the premises. This recognition of inevitability it seems to me always occurs whenever we have the experience of proof. Logic enables us to formulate some of the necessary conditions which must be satisfied before proof is recognized, but the conditions so formulated are by no means sufficient, as one can discover by watching some ten-year-old reading the Principia Mathematica. It would probably not be possible at present to formulate a sufficient set of conditions for the acceptance of proof, but one general characterization is obvious, namely that proof is a private matter. A proof presented to me with the authority of the greatest logician in the world is not a proof for me unless I can " see " it. ' Any use I may make of such a proof is mechanical, leading it is true to correct results in a limited domain, but sterile when I try to carry it into new fields. There is thus a private component in the enterprise of logic. There is another private component not only to logic but universal to any intellectual enterprise, or at least any such enterprise to which the attribute of correctness may be imputed. How shall I guard against my own mistakes, or how shall I assure myself that I am really doing what I think I am doing? How do I know that I am not dreaming? I think there is no intellectual enterprise in which the possibility of self-doubt does not lurk in the background, and no intellectual enterprise in which we have confidence in which there is not some method by which we may at least partially remove such self-doubt. The methods by which we give ourselves such assurance are complicated and seldom formulated, but I think they contain recognizably an introspective component which must be private and furthermore cannot possibly be made sharp. Herein is a justification for the contention that we never achieve perfect sharpness, for we can obviously always push our analysis to the point of self-doubt. The apparent sharpness of logic and mathematics are at a different and earlier level, where we have deliberately conspired not to push our analysis to embarrassing lengths. If every intellectual enterprise contains a private com ponent then science as a special case also contains a private component. It is usual to ignore this private component and to think of science as an essentially " public " enterprise; in</page><page sequence="18">496 P. W. BRIDGMAN fact the possibility of publicity is sometimes made a part of the definition of science. It is obvious that under this sort of a definition the much prized " objectivity " of science is ensured. Although this public component in science doubt less exists and is important, I believe that the private component is even more important. For any scientist worthy of the name does not accept the public body of scientific knowledge simply because it is public or has the authority of the consensus of his colleagues. He does not accept any scientific result of others unless he is convinced that he too could obtain the same result if he took the time and the trouble, and he demands that any scientific investigation published in a technical journal be described in such terms that he can see how to go to work tô verify the result for himself. No argument presented to him by his colleague is accepted as valid unless it bears the impress of proof. Now both these matters, the potentiality of repetition by himself and the presence of proof, are private. No creative science can exist without them. Indeed if one means creative science in the narrower sense of advance into new territory, then from the very definition creative science must be private, for always the advance into new territory is made by some individual. But even in the broader sense of a creative science which for every scientist is at least recreative, the private component seems to me incomparably more important; without this component science is formal and dead. There is another aspect of science closely related to this matter of public versus private. If the meanings of science are to be found in operations, then there must be a performer of the operations, and this is of necessity a human performer. A complete formulation of what is involved in any scientific enterprise must have somewhere in the background the performer of the operations. Now it seems to be the instinct of the conventional scientist to try to suppress this performer in the background, and in fact he makes an ideal and a virtue out of such suppression. This is sometimes expressed by saying that any scientific formulation must be freed from its anthropomorphic elements. Perhaps this urge to get rid of all human reference and the conviction of the necessity for it has been pushed to its extreme form in the general theory of relativity of Einstein. In this theory the fundamental equa</page><page sequence="19">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 497 tions of physics are formulated in generalized coordinates from which all mention of any particular reference system has disappeared, and from the form of this generalized formulation certain conclusions are purportedly extracted as to the nature of the general laws. It is obvious that the frame of mind of Einstein, who expects that a formulation like this is possible and capable of giving information, is entirely different from the frame of mind engendered by the operational approach which recognizes that an operation demands an operator, so that the nature of meaning itself makes it impossible to get away from a reference system (the operator). In Einstein's yearning for absolute information and meaning it seems to me that the ghosts of Newton's absolute space and time are walking again, ghosts which Einstein himself had apparently exorcised in his special theory of relativity. Of course, if one is to indulge in a criticism like this of Einstein's general theory, it is incumbent to show how it was that he got his results. I have attempted to do this in detail in my Nature of Physical Theory and again in a chapter in the book edited by Schilpp on the Philosophy of Einstein scheduled to appear in the fall of 1949. In brief, it appears to me that the results have followed, not from the form of the equations as one might infer, but from the requirement of simplicity, which is something quite different. This is not the place, however, to pursue this matter further. One meets the same endeavor to get away from the human reference point and to find absolue meanings in a very much broader setting than that of the physical sciences. This has been the theme of much of philosophy and is involved in the asking of such questions as " Do objects continue to exist in the absence of a perceiving mind? " It seems to me that the very nature of meaning itself makes it impossible to get away from the human reference point, and that to attempt it or to set it up as a goal betrays a fundamental misconception. Let us now revert briefly to some of the further con sequences of the operational point of view in the situations of daily life. Perhaps the most immediate is, as already stated, an enhanced realization of the complexity of our conceptual structures. Nearly all our concepts have multiple meanings, usually not explicitly stated, and one or the other of these meanings is predominantly used on one or another</page><page sequence="20">498 P. W. BRIDGMAN level of activity where the operations have a certain degree oi homogeneity. One is not usually conscious of this, however, and uses the same word on different levels with the implication of a unique meaning. It is, for example, just as important to recognize that " theological truth " is not the same as " scientific truth ", because the operations by which the truth of a theological statement is verified are not the same as the operations by which the truth of a scientific statement is verified, as it was in relativity theory to recognize that " optical length " was not the same as " tactual length " because the corresponding operations were different. In fact, I think that one may anticipate that the consequences of failure to recognize that there are two or more kinds of truth may be even more disastrous than failure to recognise two kinds of length, because the situations in which the concept of truth are applied are so much more complicated than those in which we apply the concept of length. In these complicated situations we have the potentiality for vastly greater unsus pected detail than we ever did in the comparatively simple physical situations of relativity. Failure to recognize the presence of multiple meanings is, I believe, one of the most prevalent sources of misunderstandings. A thoroughgoing application of the operational analysis of meanings puts in our hands, I believe, the possibility of eventually eliminating failure of agreement on meanings as a source of friction in human affairs. No more potent instrument of good will can be imagined. The operational clarification of the meaning of certain specific terms may be anticipated to have important reper cussions. For instance, a metaphysical conception of the nature of the State cannot survive the analysis of the nature of the operations which in any concrete situation give meaning to statements about the State. The situation is very similar with respect to Society, which is often thought of as a sort of superpersonality, with rights and a value superior to those of the individuals who compose it. Any operational analysis of social situations leads inevitably back to the component indi viduals. The individual is the unit in terms of which all our social concepts ultimately find their meanings. No totalitarian philosophy of the state or society can survive a realization of this. It seems to me that here is a sound basis for combatting</page><page sequence="21">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHYSICS 499 the totalitarian ideology, a basis which We had lost in our loss of the conviction of the worth of the individual human soul in the sight of God, which was the justification for democratic ideology accepted by our fathers. The appearance of the individual at the bottom of any social analysis now leads me finally to attempt to state what seems to me the most drastic revision of our outlook forced by an uninhibited operational analysis. Not only does the individual intrude himself unmistakably when we push our analysis as far as we can see, but that individual is I. All the operations in terms of which I make my analyses are operations by me. Any description which I can give of what happens must be made in the first person. When I make a statement " objectively " in terms of a public science I am involving myself in an obvious construction to the effect that you and I are equivalent. But the chasm of meaning between you and me is unbridgeable because the operations are different. The operations which justify me in saying that I am conscious are different from the operations which justify me in saying that you are conscious, as are the operations for saying that my tooth aches from those for saying that your tooth aches. Whenever I treat thine and mine on the same basis I am deliber ately using words with a dual operational meaning, and my reason for doing this is one of convenience. The enormous convenience in social situations requires no argument. For example, we are enabled to say : " Other minds exist beside mine, and they are like it ". Now it seems to me there is no absolute answer to the question " Do other minds exist beside my mind? " The answer is : "You may say yes if you find it convenient to do so. " But if we choose to say yes, we must recognize that we have thereby dualized the concepts of mind and existence. We have not necessarily involved our selves in a fatal dilemma by choosing to dualize our concepts, for it is conceivable that there may be no overlapping of situa tions. It might be that always we shall either be able to apply the operations which define " exist when you are concerned " or the operations which define " exist when I am concerned ", so that we would have merely the sum of two situations. Whether this is actually the case or not can be told by examination. My belief is that this will not turn out to be the case, but that it often happens that we apply the</page><page sequence="22">500 P. W. BRIDGMAN " you " operations in " me " situations, as when we think of our sensations in terms of our bodily organs appre hended in the same way as we apprehend the organs of our fellows. We can expect confusion when we do not recognize cases of overlapping usage of the " you n and the " me " operations, or perhaps we can say better public and private operations, and it seems to me that this is indeed the source of most of the confusion in philoso phical discussions of the perennial you-me problems. For example, failure to disguish between public and private operations is I believe at the bottom of the difficulties usually felt in connection with the " problem " of the freedom of the will. " Freedom " here has meaning only for private oper ations, while the determinism which introduces the dilemma has its meaning in terms of public operations. It is conceivable that the situation could be dealt wjth by renouncing the " me " operations altogether and by dealing with all " me " situations by " you " operations exclusively. But to do this would require a self renunciation which is apparently beyond human self control, and even if done, it would be at the crippling expense of discarding something that we know we can always do. It seems to me that the only realistic way of dealing with the situation is to recognize that we have here a fundamental dichotomy which pervades every aspect of our relations with our fellows. We will never achieve freedom from possible dilemma and paradox until we devise a method of thinking and a language in which this dichotomy is incorporated. From the point of view of the conventional " objective " language of " reality " it may appear that this involves such great complexities as to be hopeless. In fact, our failure ordinarily to even recognize the existence of the situation may be explained by its obvious complexity. For instance, if the science of everyone is private, do we not have as many sciences as there are individual scientists? We automatically shy away from a situation as complex as this. But although we may appear to have complexity here, it is from the old point of view of a hybrid reality in which all the other I's are comprehended under the same reality as I myself. If the actual operational construction of the world, as revealed by observation, is accepted at its face value, this dilemma will never arise, nor will we use a hybrid</page><page sequence="23">RECENT POINTS OF VIEW IN PHY8IC8 501 reality concept in our thinking, and at most there can be only " my science " and " your science " or " my pain " and " your pain In most of the purely physical sciences recognition of this dichotomy will make little actual difference. But in such subjects as psychology it will make a great difference, as I have tried to indicate in a recent discussion ', and we may expect that in social situations in general an adequate apprehension of it will demand a complete reform ulation of social philosophy. In concluding, I think it must be evident that hardly more than a beginning has been made on the task of remaking the world from the operational point of view. In physics, much remains to be done, particularly, I think, in making a more articulate analysis of the concepts of physics into their instrumental and " paper and pencil " aspects. In philo sophy, a greater consciousness of the complexity of our verbal structures will result in a shift of emphasis and interest. Most philosophical discussions of metaphysics, for example, will appear to be fundamentally discussions of the properties of our verbal structures and of their adequacy to deal with various verbal situations. In religion, the realization that it is impossible and meaningless to transcend the human reference point will bring the vision that the history of religion since the birth of the race has been the history of an attempt to evade the fundamental problem of humanity, namely to find its springs of action within itself. In the social and political domain it will appear that all social and political philosophy has failed to recognize the dichotomy which to a fresh and unspoiled vision is the most striking feature of the experience of each of us, and in failing to recognize the dichotomy has inextricably confused public and private operations. Adequate recognition of the dichotomy will force a revision of the philosophy at the basis of our legal and social structures.
