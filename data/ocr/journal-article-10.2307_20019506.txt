Stud. 27, pp. 511-521 PAUL WILLIAMS SOME DIMENSIONS OF THE RECENT WORK OF RAIMUNDO PANIKKAR: A BUDDHIST PERSPECTIVE1 The Dalai Lama is fond of quoting a statement in which the Buddha is said to have asserted that no one should accept his word out of respect for the Buddha himself, but only after testing it, analysing it ' as a goldsmith analyses gold, through cutting, melting, scraping and rubbing it'. The Dalai Lama is often referred to as the temporal and spiritual leader of Tibet, but in truth as a spiritual figure His Holiness, while respected, indeed revered by almost all Tibetans, usually speaks from within the perspective of one particular tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, that of the dGe lugs (pronounced 'Geluk'). Founded in the late fourteenth century by Tsong kha pa, the dGe lugs has always stressed the importance of reasoning, analytic rationality, on the spiritual path. This dGe lugs perspective is by no means shared by all Buddhists, at least not in the form it there takes. Nevertheless it does represent an important direction in Buddhist thinking on reasoning and the spiritual path which can be traced back in Indian Buddhism a very long way indeed, and it is in the light of dGe lugs thought that I want to contemplate two points which seem to be crucial in Raimundo Panikkar's approach to inter religious dialogue and understanding : first, that Reality, Being, transcends the intelligible, the range of consciousness, and second, that understanding this is the only basis for tolerance, not seeking in one way or another to overcome the other. I should state straight away that Professor Panikkar's search for an in? tellectually satisfying basis for trust, mutual respect and acceptance between religions is one with which the modern Buddhist is sure to have considerable sympathy, and by and large this would have been broadly true throughout Buddhist history. And yet Panikkar's contention (I should add, a common one in writing on the theology of inter-religious dialogue) that Reality transcends the intelligible, the appropriate response to which is 'cosmic confidence', 'which impels us to trust even what we do not understand or approve of2 looks to the outsider like the old claim that what Christians call 1 This paper is a lightly revised version of a paper originally given in reply to Raimundo Panikkar's 1989 Younghusband Lecture to the World Congress of Faiths, Heythrop College, London. 2 See Raimundo Panikkar, 'The invisible harmony: a universal theory of religion or a cosmic confidence in reality', in Towards a Universal Theology, ed. by Leonard Swidler (New York, Orbis, 1988), p. 148.

And I suspect that this is simply not a position that the Buddhist, and certainly not a Buddhist of the dGe lugs tradition, could accept. The follower of dGe lugs could not accept the very presuppositions and foundation for Panikkar's theology of dialogue. To explain. For dGe lugs exegetes the range of being is very much circumscribed by the knowable, and there is no Being, no Absolute at all.3 The idea that there might be something which does not fall within the range of the mind in some sense - either the ordinary dualistic mind or the non dualistic mind, the awareness of ordinary people or Saints, through direct perception, inference, or inferentially-based scriptural testimony - is thought to be absurd. Among synonyms for 'existent' (yod pa) learnt by young Tibetan monks in their first classes is 'cognitive object' (shes bya), defined as 'that which is suitable to be taken as a mental referent' (bloyul du byar rung). If something cannot be known in any way then it cannot be. It should be clear that this is not the same thing as rendering all knowledge 'scientific' knowledge, or the only way of knowing is that of the classroom, seminary or laboratory. Nevertheless it does mean that a hypothetical existent which cannot be known had might as well not exist, indeed, for the dGe lugs tradition (basing itself on Indian writers such as Dharmak?rti) it does not exist. dGe lugs writers speak of three types of existents classified according to the ways by which we might come to know them.4 There are evident phenomena known through direct experience, hidden phenomena cognised through inference, and finally very hidden phenomena. Phenomena in this last category are said to be known from the (or a) Buddha through scriptural testimony. Thus things can be known empirically, through reasoned infer? ence, or through the scriptures.5 But Buddhist thinkers make it quite clear 3 The dGe lugs philosophical position follows very rigorously that known in Indian Buddhism as Prasa?gika Madf?yamaka, which embodies a sustained critique of any concept of inherent existence, any Absolute, or Being-as-such. This critique extends to all things, including nirvana or the Buddha. For an outline of the Madhyamaka approach and position see my Mahayana Buddhism : The Doctrinal Foundations (London, Routledge, 1989), chapter 3. I shall say a little more about this subsequently. Note, incidentally that Panikkar seems to suggest more than once that any perspective which sees the range of being as circumscribed by the knowable must equal an idealist position. This does not follow, for it does not in itself entail in any sense that all is consciousness. See Panikkar's 'Religious pluralism: the metaphysical challenge ', in Religious Pluralism, ed. by Leroy S. Rouner (Boston, Boston University Studies in Philosophy and Religion vol. 5, 1984), p. no, and his 'The Jordan, the Tiber and the Ganges: three kairological moments of Christie self-consciousness', in The Myth of Christian Uniqueness, ed. by John Hick and Paul F.

Tsong kha pa has discussed this topic in the introductory sections of his Great Treatise on the Stages of Mantra (sJVgags rim chen mo). It is important to the power of a Buddhist's subsequent religious practices that he or she gains an unwavering conviction in the Triple Gem - the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sa?gha. This can be done through inherited or learnt faith, but it is proper for those who can, those ' with strong minds ' to ' seek firm conviction ' through the means of valid knowledge. It is necessary to analyse inferentially, Tsong kha pa says, 'Only reasoning distinguishes what is or is not true.'6 There should be no contempt or hatred for other systems, just calm reason? ing. Commenting, the Dalai Lama makes it quite clear that for him the purpose of reasoning here is not in order to make partisan claims for the superiority of Buddhism, and to disparage other teachings. Rather, it is in order that Buddhists should gain clear conviction about their own teachings 'in order that persons who would be helped more through engaging in the Buddhist path than through another system might not be diverted to another path'.7 It is Tsong kha pa's contention, and that of the dGe lugs tradition, that it is necessary not for polemical or apologetic but for religious reasons to engage in analytic reasoning in order to demonstrate (or otherwise) those elements of the Dharma which cannot be known now through direct ex? perience. A common expression in Buddhism for nirvana is 'seeing things the way they really are' (yath?bh?tadarsana). It appears to be an important corollary of the transcendence of Reality to our conceptual categories for Raimundo Panikkar that there is indeed a pluralism of truths or, as he puts it, 'being is pluralistic'.8 There is a sense in which each religion could be true in a way. But for the Buddhist from his own perspective, as the great missionary to Tibet Atisa stated in the eleventh century, ' the ultimate truth is unitary'.9 Moreover the discovery and assertion of this truth is of soterio? logical importance. The central role of analytic reasoning in this process, as well as the nature of the ultimate truth as understood by Madhyamaka since if a meditator had a vision of the Buddha, or if anyone actually met a Buddha, and was taught a very hidden phenomenon this too would have to be classed under the third category. It does not mean just knowledge gained through scriptures understood as books. 6 See Tsong kha pa (1977), p. 87. 7 Ibid., p. 31. 8 See here, for example, Panikkar (1984), p. 111 : 'If we take religious pluralism seriously we cannot avoid asserting that truth itself is pluralistic - at least for the time being, which is our being in time and on which we need to rely for our very thinking.' Also p. 112: 'Truth is pluralistic, we said. This amounts to saying that being itself is pluralistic, that reality is irreducible to a monolithic unit, irreducible to pure transparency, irriduible to intellect or Spirit' (my italics). 9 dam pa'i don geig nyid de /Text edited in Chr. Lindtner, 'Atis'a's Introduction to the Two Truths, and its Sources', Journal of Indian Philosophy 9 (1981), pp. 161-214, verse 4.</page><page sequence="4">514 PAUL WILLIAMS Buddhism, which Atisa and the dGe lugs follow as the highest philosophical expression of Buddhism, is made clear by Atisa when he states that ' If one analyses with reasoning this conventional realm as it appears, nothing is found. The very nonfindingness is the ultimate.'10 If truth is plural, if for example contradictory statements about the ultimate way of things could be equally true, then what of enlightenment? Does enlightenment, which is said to equal knowing things the way they really are, make sense any more ? How can it be attained? And can Buddhists have trust in the Buddha and his way any longer when it seems that there are fundamental matters uncovered by Panikkar - the pluralism of truths - which the Buddha appears not to have known ? For Atisa and the dGe lugs tradition truth, ultimate truth, is one and is accessible to analytic reasoning. From this perspective as regards the ultimate truth it is not sufficient simply to have faith or, as Panikkar would have it, 'cosmic confidence in Reality'. Nor is it sufficient simply to cite scripture. Tsong kha pa points out that all religions have their faith and their scriptures. In fact very few topics are classed by Buddhist scholars under the category of 'very hidden phenomena', those which can be known only from the Buddha, usually via scriptural testimony. Everything to do with the ultimate truth, ultimate way of things - emptiness - and therefore that the full cog? nition of which alone leads to liberation (seeing things the way they really are) comes under the category of hidden, and not very hidden, phenomena. That is, ultimate truth, emptiness, which is, as we shall see, nothing more than absence of inherent existence, is capable of being demonstrated by reasoning. The principal class of very hidden phenomena concerns the exact details of the workings of karma and rebirth. These details cannot be known by the mind of one other than a Buddha, an omniscient being. For an unenlightened being they cannot be known by either experience or inference. They must almost invariably be known, therefore, through scripture. But, and this is crucial, Tsong kha pa (following his Indian predecessors) makes it clear that it is possible to infer the reliability of scripture, and therefore the rationality of relying on scripture, based on inference from the reliability of the Buddha and his teachings in areas where direct inference is in place. In other words, the argument runs, if through experience and inference topics like the ultimate truth, emptiness, can be shown to be coherent then it is rational to rely on the testimony of the Buddha for other topics, a very small class of items, none of which concerns the ultimate truth, which cannot be directly demonstrated through reasoning. It is said that the rationality of following scriptures treating very hidden topics should be based on the 'threefold analysis' {dpyadpagsum).n First, the scripture must not be refuted by direct experience, nor, second, by inference 10 Ibid. verse 21 : kun rdzobji lar snang ba 'dif'rigs pas brtags na 'ga' mi rnyed/ma rnyed pa nyid don dam yin/. 11 Tsong kha pa (1977), p. 33; Tillemans, pp. 35-6.</page><page sequence="5">THE RECENT WORK OF RAIMUNDO PANIKKAR 515 nor, finally, must it be damaged by other scriptural assertions. That is, it can be shown to be rational to accept scriptural testimony on very hidden topics on the basis of the reliability of the Buddhist teaching concerning evident and hidden topics, shown through experience and inference, coupled with the fact that the scriptures involved are consistent and not refuted by stronger means of establishing validity - experience and inference. Thus, as the Dalai Lama always stresses, it is important to apply reasoning. Indeed the Dalai Lama provides an interesting example of the application of this traditional Buddhist approach to reasoning in the modern context of the relationship of science to religious tenet and faith. He has stated quite categorically that if through scientific investigation something emerges which is incompatible with the Buddhist position, and the scientific results are certain, the Buddhist position must be abandoned. He has given as an example the flat-earth theory which forms part of traditional Buddhist cosmology in the important and influential text the Abhidharmakosa. This, the Dalai Lama says, is wrong and should not be advocated. If one day science (or, we might add, any other form of rational investigation) shows that rebirth is definitely false then, the Dalai Lama states with great confidence, 'we must accept it and we will accept it'.12 Of course, if we had space we might discuss here Panikkar's point that our very category of ' rationality ' itself is a disputable and quite possibly cultur? ally conditioned one.13 I am not sure that I can make much sense of the notion of different types of rationality. Certainly there is no clear-cut dis? tinction between Western 'scientific' rationality and the (more mystical?) thought of the East. It may come as a surprise to hear that Madhyamaka thought as expressed by the dGe lugs tradition is based on clear analytic reason, with a rigid (some would say slavish) adherence to the principle of non-contradiction. But it is certainly not contradictory to maintain that those who construct religious systems which quite simply are contradictory are defacto wrong.14 This is not to say that they are wrong in all respects, that they are evil, or that no one should follow such systems. But they are still in the last analysis wrong, factually wrong, in at least one respect - that is, the respect that is contradictory. In Madhyamaka Buddhism, the doctrinal tradition held by the dGe lugs 12 H.H. the Dalai Lama, The Bodhgaya Interviews, edited by Jos? Ignacio Cabez?n (New York, Snow Lion, 1988), p. 21. The Dalai Lama's contention that Buddhists should abandon a tenet if science has shown it to be 100% definitely incorrect may be too strict. What is required is some notion of what it is to be rational. I can imagine cases where science has not shown something to be definitely false, although the burden of proof has shifted to the other side, and it may now be irrational to accept any longer without some such proof the original tenet. 13 See, for example, Panikkar (1988), pp. 119-22. 14 Unless of course the contradiction is resolved or dissolved away on a higher level. But this resolution must be capable of being expressed. It is no use saying of a blatantly contradictory system that the contradiction is resolved on a higher level without showing how it is resolved. The system itself points to the higher level, but if it is simply contradictory, the contradiction is not resolved, it has no higher level. It is just contradictory, and those who follow that system are simply left with a contradiction.</page><page sequence="6">5l6 PAUL WILLIAMS to teach the highest truth, that ultimate truth is called emptiness.15 Briefly, emptiness equals absence of inherent existence, which is to say lacking ultimate existence or essence. When M?dhyamika Buddhists say something is empty they mean that it does not exist from its own side apart from, say, its parts. All, absolutely all, is dependent, relative. Emptiness is the ultimate truth - that is, the ultimate truth is told when we say that all things, no matter how exalted, be they Buddha, nirvana or worms, are empty of ultimate, i.e. independent, existence. The range of this even includes emp? tiness itself. How do we know that something lacks inherent existence? The answer, and this is crucial, is that if something had inherent existence it would resist analysis. To take a trivial, and therefore non-controversial, example, if the letter A had inherent existence it would be there, independent of its parts. But we find that if we take the three strokes apart the letter A is lost. Bring them close together again in a particular way and the A suddenly appears. The A itself has no inherent existence, it is simply a conceptual construct existing in dependence upon the imputing mind. All things, it is maintained, are like this. If we analyse emptiness as well, it will not be found indepen? dently of the imputing mind. And the mind too, for that matter, is not independent of the imputing mind. Thus the Madhyamaka contention is that emptiness is the final nature of all phenomena. That is, if analysed they are not found. This is emphatically not thought to mean they simply do not exist, any more than the scientist who states that material objects are made up out of energies or whatever is stating that they do not exist. Rather, the Madhyamaka considers itself to be explicating what it is to exist in the only way things can exist. There is no Absolute, no Being, no Reality if that means something independent of the imputing mind, something inherently existent. From the Madhyamaka per? spective it is felt that this can be known and demonstrated through reasoning. Such reason for Tsong kha pa is the first and very necessary stage in the process of cognising the ultimate truth, emptiness itself. Far from the ultimate truth transcending rationality, there can be no cognition of the ultimate without rationality. And without cognising the ultimate there is no liber? ation, nirvana. When we analyse and come to an awareness that the object of analysis, say the Self, lacks inherent existence we are said thereby to attain one sort of awareness of emptiness - a knowledge that the Self is empty of inherent existence. If we place our mind as unwaveringly as possible on the actual feeling of absence which has arisen at the end of analysis then we might be said to have attained an experience of emptiness. These are different 15 What follows is a very brief outline of emptiness in Madhyamaka, since I had treated this topic is greater depth in my paper to the World Congress of Faiths conference in autumn 1988, in dialogue with Hans K?ng. That has since been published (with misprints) as 'Some Buddhist Reflections on Hans K?ng's treatment of Mahayana Buddhism in Christianity and the World Religions', World Faiths Insight, n.s. 22, June 1989, pp. 13-26. Further details are given in Williams (1989), chapter 3.</page><page sequence="7">THE RECENT WORK OF RAIMUNDO PANIKKAR 517 types of experience, experience that and experience of, although the object of experience, emptiness, is the same. Even the experience of emptiness here is not thought to be a final direct experience of emptiness, which requires considerable and long practise of mediation. The experience of emptiness which occurs for beginners at the end of an analysis is emptiness as mediated by a conceptual image. Emptiness itself is not directly, non-dualistically, non conceptually present to awareness. So, for the dGe lugs tradition there are different ways of knowing the ultimate truth, emptiness. Knowledge gained through intellectual analysis is not the same as knowledge gained in deep meditation. And yet the direct nonconceptual awareness of emptiness is the culminating point of a process which necessarily began with analytic investigation, reason, and no way contradicts it. The issue is one of different and successive modes of access to emptiness, not different emptinesses or ultimate truths. It is crucial to Tsong kha pa's position that the ultimate truth known directly in nondual medi? tative absorption is the very same emptiness discovered through analysis. It is none other than, nothing greater than, absence of inherent existence. The expression ' absence of inherent existence ' expresses perfectly accurately what the ultimate truth is, and it can and must be realised through our powers of rationality. The ultimate truth can indeed completely fall within the range of not just the mind but the rational analytic mind. The ultimate truth here is nothing mysterious, nothing on which there are different Truth systems or 4 windows', to use one of Panikkar's favorite expressions, and it certainly does not require at any level the suppression or even transcendence of rationality to reach beyond to Something Else, some Reality not accessible to the analytic mind.16 Now, it might be objected that what I am doing here is simply juxtaposing a Buddhist doctrinal schema with the approach enunciated by Panikkar. And such is to beg the question, for Panikkar's approach, it might be argued, is not directed at the level of rival dogmas. It is granted that the dGe lugs doctrinal schema denies primacy of that which is not subject to analytic investigation, but Panikkar's explanation is intended to provide a meeting point, a basis for tolerance beyond such rival dogmatic systems. This objection, I think, misses the point. The issue here is one of the acceptability of Panikkar's framework for interreligious contact and dialogue. Put another way, from what pole does Panikkar himself speak? In asserting the tran? scendence of the Real to thinking as a basis for pluralism Panikkar asserts something which is simply not accepted from the position of, in this case, Madhyamaka as explicated by the dGe lugs tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. 16 For further discussion of the Madhyamaka perspective on these issues see Williams (1989), chapter 3, and contrast it with the Buddha-nature or tath?gatagarbha teachings of Mahayana Buddhism treated ibid, chapter 5. The use of the letter A as an example comes from Jeffrey Hopkins' The Tantric Distinction (London, Wisdom, 1984), pp. 16-17. Panikkar's important concept of the 'window' can be found in his 'Invisible Harmony' paper, pp. 139-40.</page><page sequence="8">5l8 PAUL WILLIAMS Indeed, for dGe lugs followers like the Dalai Lama in the last analysis it would have severe soteriological repercussions. Consequently there is no way, granted Panikkar's framework, that he can extend his tolerance to the perspective from which the Dalai Lama speaks - unless, I suppose, Panikkar sees his own position in purely relative terms, as simply yet another window on Reality which makes no special claims for itself but will tolerantly allow for other incompatible windows on Reality including those which reject the very notion of Reality and its windows. This, however, appears not to be the case. Panikkar must make greater claims for his position than simply another window. Like so many frame? works set up for interreligious dialogue, Panikkar's own model must involve a claim that this is the model which should be adopted, which sees things the way they really are. Panikkar's position is the position which postulates the window-model, inadequately understood by others, which sees and sets-forth the truth and limitations of every window on Reality. Panikkar tells us that each window sees the whole through a part. What, we might ask, are the grounds for this claim - and other similar claims which set out to provide a basis for dialogue by limiting the claims set forth by each religion itself? By what criteria does Panikkar know that two windows look out onto the same Whole.17 Clearly his position cannot be yet another window for fear of infinite regress. But from where does he gain access to the transcendental truth which enables him to postulate his Pluralism of Truth, a view which is definitely not that of, say, the dGe lugs window? One cannot avoid the feeling that in the end, ultimately, Panikkar does hold that all religions will come to the One Truth. He states at one point (quoted below, note 8) that Truth for us, as concerns our (my italics) being in time, is pluralistic. Else? where he speaks of not holding the transcendental unity of all religions in an unqualified way- cIt goes in this direction'.18 Panikkar freely states his own personal faith that this Reality is Christ or, as he sometimes writes, God.19 The problem is that the windows, and that on which they are windows are becoming confused. Either Panikkar speaks only from the Christian window, in which case he cannot say anything about an Ultimate Reality on which there are different windows, or if he speaks from a ' transcendental ' stand? point outside all windows this must be justified and not asserted. The fear of the Buddhist I suspect is that Panikkar's transcendental viewpoint in fact is that of a rather liberal Christian, or at least some form of theist. His Ultimate Reality, being, is God, Christ, in whatever form Panikkar as Christian conceives of it. From the perspective of the dGe lugs tradition Panikkar wants 17 This point is well made in a critical paper on Panikkar's 'Invisible Harmony' by Bibhuti S. Yadav, 'Anthropomorphism and cosmic confidence' also found in the Swidler volume (1988), p. 180. Never? theless I find myself in considerable disagreement with Yadav's other comments on the interpretation of Candrak?rti and the nature of Madhyamaka - a reading which owes more to psychoanalytic theory, I think, than to a careful study of all of Candrak?rti's texts, including those which do not survive in Sanskrit. 18 'The Jordan', p. 92 (my italics). 19 Ibid. pp. 113-14. For 'God' see, for example, 'Religious Pluralism', p. 112.</page><page sequence="9">THE RECENT WORK OF RAIMUNDO PANIKKAR 519 to have his cake and eat it, to have his window and window-transcending Reality, when he would have been more successful had he embraced com? pletely his own perspective of mind-dependence, emptiness, the windows, and thrown out the Reality! There are many other topics of both agreement and disagreement that I should have liked to examine in Panikkar's stimulating thought. For there is much that a M?dhyamika Buddhist can agree with in Panikkar's stress on dependence and relativity. But space is limited. I have offered some critical comments from the perspective of one tradition, dGe lugs Buddhism, on the claim that reality transcends reason, and on this ground Truth is Plural. The attraction of Panikkar's approach is that, superficially at least, it apparently provides a framework for tolerance. I want now to glance at this facet of our discussion and ask how the dGe lugs tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, at least in its contemporary form, is able to construct a basis for religious tolerance. It seems to me that the attraction of Panikkar's framework for tolerance is for liberal Christians and is itself a phase in the history of Christian theology. From the dGe lugs point of view, on the other hand, the Dalai Lama has often spoken of the topics of dialogue and tolerance. His approach operates within three parameters. First, there is an ultimate way of things, which can be approached and demonstrated through reasoning. Second, it is by no means necessary that everyone should engage in this reasoning, or adopt a Buddhist perspective. Indeed it may be positively wrong. Error may not be evil.20 Relatively the highest teachings (i.e. those which teach the ultimate way of things) may be inappropriate and therefore bad and in one sense wrong. If person Y does not agree or is not convinced that what person X holds to be the ultimate truth is the ultimate truth this, from the Dalai Lama's Buddhist perspective, should be perfectly acceptable to X, indicating the appropriateness of other teachings - precisely those which Y does find convincing. And the same, of course, should be the case for person Y. And third, it is of fundamental importance to the Dalai Lama to extend complete respect to other religions. In terms of reasoning to find the ultimate truth, if carried out correctly and without bias the Dalai Lama holds as himself a Buddhist, in common with all dGe lugs practitioners, that only Buddhism will be found to make final sense. Even within Buddhism, however, there are different teachings, and only certain teachings will be found to articulate in the last analysis that ultimate truth. It is a widespread Mah?y?na view upheld by the dGe lugs that the Buddha taught all these other teachings as stages on the path, suitable for people at particular levels. For those at certain stages in their spiritual progress these other teachings make more sense, and will be more appropriate. The Dalai Lama has applied these same intra-Buddhist points 20 A point, incidentally, which Panikkar seems to assume in his approach to tolerance. If we are to be tolerant, he seems to think it follows that we cannot consider others who do not share our perspective to wrong.</page><page sequence="10">520 PAUL WILLIAMS to the issue of inter-religious contact. For some, Christian teachings, for others Muslim or Jewish teachings make more sense, are more convincing, and must be seen by Buddhists as more appropriate. Since people are different, different teachings are suitable. The diversity of religions is a good thing. The Dalai Lama has made it quite clear that he opposes the idea of only one religion, whether an existing religion or a composite 4pick-n-mix' creation. And he has stated equally firmly that he does not want everyone to convert to Buddhism. Rather, religious believers should follow whole? heartedly their own traditions. Of course, he adds, if someone no longer finds his or her own tradition convincing then it is appropriate to investigate other teachings in order to find out whether an alternative may be more convincing and spiritually more helpful. Not only is it not necessary to try and convert others to Buddhism, the Dalai Lama's view appears to be that in general (and in contradiction with some contemporary Buddhist movements) this is positively wrong. It is no use trying to convince others with missionary zeal of the supposed inferiority of their own beliefs. If the missionary does not succeed, the Dalai Lama points out, he or she will have wasted time and also, perhaps, weakened the faith of the other. Since all religions, if followed faithfully and properly, are for the real benefit of sentient beings, this weakening of faith could be most un? fortunate.21 From a Buddhist perspective there is no hurry. The ultimate truth can wait - it is not necessarily of such immediate importance, there are many future lives and very few of us, Buddhists included, will attain en? lightenment in this life, or even the next. Moreover the Dalai Lama holds that just as the Buddha taught many teachings within Buddhism to suit those at different levels, it is appropriate for a Buddhist (and may be true) to see other religions as teachings of the compassionate Buddha for those in different circumstances and situations. Thus, in general, in condemning other religions the Buddhist may be condemning the teaching of the Buddha (which is not to say that every practice in other religions could be accepted by a Buddhist-animal or human sacrifice, for instance). The Dalai Lama has stated, for example, that it is definite that Jesus Christ was a superior being, and it is likely that he was an enlightened being manifesting in an appro? priate way to lead others forward.22 Moreover within each religion the Dalai Lama wishes, rather as does Panikkar, not to stress the philosophical or doctrinal dimensions - but, I think, in a different way from Panikkar. For the Dalai Lama the sphere of Truth is not of primary importance either between religions or in society generally. Primary concern is that of human relationships, loving kindness, what he calls the 'Good Heart'. Here, the Dalai Lama contends, all religions reach a Unity - they are all concerned with the welfare and benefit of sentient beings. As Panikkar himself says 21 See H.H. the Dalai Lama (1988), pp. 22-23. See a^so PP- n_i4 on a number of these themes. 22 John F. Avedon, An Interview with the Dalai Lama (New York, Littlebird Publications, 1980), p. 58.</page><page sequence="11">THE RECENT WORK OF RAIMUNDO PANIKKAR 521 somewhere, goodness and Truth are not the same. All religions, the Dalai Lama contends, are concerned with developing love and kindness. Our concern should be with goodness, and between religions the issue of Truth is relatively not so important.23 I have been concerned to explain the Dalai Lama's perspective on inter religious encounter. He is a Buddhist and a follower of the dGe lugs tradition. I do not pretend that there are not areas of considerable difficulty in his perspective. For Panikkar, I suspect, the Dalai Lama's position still involves intolerance, for ultimately the Dalai Lama maintains that the final truth is that of Madhyamaka Buddhism as it is understood by the dGe lugs tradition. But I think Panikkar's perspective also involves subtle intolerance of this type, and it seems to me that there is nothing fundamentally wrong in that. There is a danger of the word ' tolerance ' becoming a slogan here. There is nothing in itself wrong in followers of each religion thinking that they have something, some important truth, the others lack, and there is nothing wrong in thinking that one's own religion is right in this respect. The position of the Dalai Lama nevertheless, it seems to me, represents a rare tolerance and humanity - all the real tolerance that is required of a religious practitioner. It is a tolerance based on Buddhist premisses, but perhaps with a universal appeal. For Buddhists, anyway, it is a tolerance which does not require a denial of the supreme position of rationality, and the recourse to a Pluralism of Truth.

This whole book can be warmly recommended for its wide-ranging and readable treatment by the Dalai Lama of a number of issues of contemporary relevance. It must be admitted, incidentally, that the idea that all religions are aiming at the welfare and benefit of sentient beings, that this is in some sense their common core or essence, strikes one as a noble but highly contentious and perhaps naive claim concerning a very complex situation and issue.</page></plain_text>
