<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE WHORE-MADONNA IN THE POETRY OF JOSÉ DE ESPRONCEDA Ricardo Landeira Aesthetic distance in Espronceda's poetry is never too significant. This does not imply, however, that all of his poems grow out of a real circumstance nor that those which do are uniformly memorable. Yet it can be said that among the poeťs most important compositions, those whose ascendancy derives from daily or the poeťs own inti- macy, that have a raison d'etre extrinsic to the strictly literary, are masterpieces. In the totality of his production, one of its constants, the sentimental, expresses Espronceda's growing pessimism as years go by and his bitterness resulting from love's disillusionment. From the semihopeful, sweet and nostalgic love sung in the early sonnet "Fresca, lozana, pura y olorosa," his muse turns gradually to bitter songs of indifference toward life and damnation of the loved one, as in "A Jarifa en una orgía," where Espronceda's own suffering is beyond doubt. 1 This trajectory suggests an increasing realization of the abyss separating what he as poet can fantasize and what he as a man has within reach. He is confronted with a fundamental incongruence between vital posture and artistic manifestation, hence the ascending index of angst and rebellion. The awareness of this imbalance - the imaginable versus the attainable - leads Espron- ceda to despair, first, because he feels incapable of bridging the distance that separates them, and second, because he cannot adjust his desires to the possibilities before him. Herein lies the inherent contradiction of Romanticism, of an art out of true with the poeťs experience. By following the course of his lyrical love poetry through 1 The edition used is José de Espronceda, Poesías líricas y fragmentos épicos , ed. Robert Marrast (Madrid: Castalia, 1970).

"A una estrella," "Jarifa . . . ," and the "Canto a Teresa," I intend to reveal the fascinating dilemma which Espronceda as a Romantic faced, the fundamental dilemma of the skeptic. Because Romanticism is a system of contradictions amounting to an aesthetic of sentiments, 2 the muse of Romantic poetry is sentimental exaltation. We owe to Teresa Mancha, the femme fatale of Espronceda's love life, the inspiration of the most valued category of his verses, the emotional or love lyric. The subject corresponding to this lyric will always be a woman, whom the poet identifies and confuses with love itself. The sonnet, preferred lyric form of Spanish Renaissance and Baroque literatures, is rarely used by that country's Romantics who shy away from its rigid structure. Its fixed form does not allow a free-flowing rhythm, demanding instead a sober and restrained language. Bécquer wrote only one, not too successfully, while Es- pronceda produced nine. His first, written before he was twenty, constitutes Espronceda's initial great love poem. Known by its inaugural verse, "Fresca, lozana, pura y olorosa", the composition remains relatively faithful to classical canons, especially if one focuses on its central metaphor, "rosa-ilusión de amor." Nevertheless, it is infused with unusual freeness, with a note of subtle sensuality ideally suited to a young love. The poem contains two united or connected thoughts: the delight derived from the rose's beauty, and the sorrow at its ephemeral existence, both present in the quatrains. The parallel course followed by love, hope and then the pain of love's loss, is insinuated in the tercets. This sonnet is distin- guished from the poet's secondary poems by virtue of a singular lyric lexicon foreshadowing the simplicity and spontaneity of ex- pression characteristic of Espronceda's later verse. Its fundamentally Romantic character can be appreciated in the play of opposites which functions in terms of the metaphor of the rose and the poet's love - freshness-flaccidity, hope-despair - concordant with the bi- membrated structure already pointed out. As the initial milestone of the author's sentimental itinerary, this sonnet enunciates the belief 2 Julián Marías, Historia de la filosofía (Madrid: Revista de Occidente, 1967), p. 321.</page><page sequence="3">194 ROMANCE NOTES that love carries a fateful burden of sadness, even if temporarily alleviated by illusion. As time passes, this initial dose of illusion diminishes progressively while the implied bitterness turns into total despair. Of a more tranquil nature because of its quietly discursive tone so infrequent in Espronceda, "A una estrella" pursues serenely for one hundred and twenty verses the poeťs path of love from incipient happiness j Ay, lucero! yo te vi resplandecer en mi frente, cuando palpitar sentí mi corazón dulcemente con amante frenesí. (29-33) through the sadness and grief felt as a result of the loss of the loved one Mas ¡ay! que luego el bien y la alegría en llanto y desventura se trocó: (21-22) to end in a glacial apathy as seen in the last strophe Yo indiferente sigo mi camino A merced de los vientos y la mar, y entregado en los brazos del destino, ni me importa salvarme o zozobrar. (116-120) In Romantic poetry, love is typically either impossible or ephemeral. In "A una estrella" the second is true. The poem consti- tutes a dialectical lament for the joy and sorrow shared between the poet and a star. The latter comes to represent the former's: hopes, refulgent when the lover feels joyful and dark when he senses himself abandoned, in an obvious pathetic fallacy. Light- happiness then is the central metaphor of the poem, uniting both subjects. The anthropomorphic star projects the poeťs nostalgia and grief, so that the "timidez," "tristeza," "juventud" and "melanco- lía" attributed to it are but an echo of his mood. The poet, withdrawn and hermetic, seeks the company of the star as a mute consolation following his amorous disappointment. The star, visualized as faith-</page><page sequence="4">THE WHORE-MADONNA IN THE POETRY OF ESPRONCEDA 195 ful, elevates love to an idealized plane with the perpetuity and radiance of its light. On the other hand, human love fatally suffers the same mortality as those who experience it, rarely achieving the desired perfection. Consequently, incapable of reconciling his dream of love with the reality of man's destiny, the poet retreats from life. In these first two poems, Espronceda has avoided all sentimental stridency. In "Fresca, lozana . . ." with traces of youthful optimism, he harbors the possible hope that a love may exist capable of uplifting man even if the joy derived lasts ever so briefly. The sustained but controlled tone of "A una estrella" manifests the growth of the pessimistic concept of love which has begun to grip the poet. The certainty of an irrevocable despair ultimately leading to a tedium vitae is the new attitude from which Espronceda hence- forth will not stray. The composed tones of amorous sentiment characterizing the two poems above disappear, to be replaced by the agitation and violence animating "A Jarifa en una orgía," the most bitter of all poems from Espronceda's pen. In it the poet feels cheated by deficient reality, aware that it does not respond to his aspirations, but is conscious that, short of death, he can expect nothing more. Much like the drug addict who comes to loathe his dependency, Y aturdan mi revuelta fantasía los brindis y el estruendo del festín, (105-106) the poet finds himself against his will a prisoner of the passions of an imperfect and impure love that ultimately jades his life. Woman, a demoniacal figure and source of a love that is damned, does not fit the poeťs dream, as he despairs for having once conceived a pure love. The spiritual passion exists only in his heart. Once externalized, it becomes hopelessly stained. And so the contemplated joy turns to grief, the flower becomes a thorn and all that man cherishes he receives in a distorted image. In the search for a love concordant with his desires, Espronceda falls into the morass of eroticism and suffocating sensuality. Happiness lies beyond the realm of palpable reality. Pleasure and hope are, alas, but chimeras which man cannot avoid despite the grief and disenchantment which surely follow.</page><page sequence="5">196 ROMANCE NOTES The poet, forced to renounce the dreams of his internal world, allows himself to be seduced by ataraxia ni el placer ni la tristura vuelvan mi pecho a turbar. (95-96) seeking to assuage the bitterness of his disillusionment. In this man- ner he avoids the "paz de los sepulcros" (76), his decision amounting to a renunciation of all that which his inner turmoil dictates. The poet withdraws from his defiant stance to seek the company of another being wounded by the same annihilating perception Ven, Jarifa; tú has sufrido como yo; tú nunca lloras. Mas ¡ay, triste! que no ignoras cuán amarga es mi aflicción. Una misma es nuestra pena, en vano el llanto contienes . . . Tú también, como yo, tienes desgarrado el corazón. (109-116) The arms of the beloved Jarifa, equally burned by despair and suffering, are the sought-after consolation to his tedium. Espronceda's despair, so patent in the love-madness of "Jarifa" and renewed in the "Canto a Teresa" is profoundly rooted in the perennial dichotomy between vital reality and the reality conceived by the poet's imagination or sentiment. The inevitable result of this dilemma is the destruction of idealistic aspirations and the poeťs consequent demoralization. The "Canto a Teresa" does not represent an attempt to resolve the conflict between a runaway idealism and impure reality, as was the case in "Jarifa," but simply an exposition of that antagonism in terms of personal despair and vilifying cruelty towards the loved one. 3 The poet, an unlucky and resentful lover, struggles to rid himself of a grief attributable less to the death of Teresa than to the prior loss of love for her due to her fall from the pedestal where Espron- ceda had placed her. His suffering, therefore, results not from the 8 Bruce W. Wardropper, "Espronceda's 'Canto a Teresa* and the Spanish Elegiac Tradition," Bulletin of Hispanic Studies , 4 (1963), 89.</page><page sequence="6">THE WHORE-MADONNA IN THE POETRY OF ESPRONCEDA 197 corporeal death but rather the demise of his love for Teresa when she ceased to exist as beloved because of her inescapable condition as a woman of flesh and blood; her descent from Eve causes her to become the soulless and perverse woman of the poem. The "Canto a Teresa" is Espronceda's last elegy. In this type of composition, memory completely absorbs the attention of the poet and his re- membrances during the forty-four octavas reales of the "Canto" are immediate and intimate. The theory of the poem's two different dates of composition is by now well-known and generally accepted. The first writing corresponds to the eighteen inaugural strophes motivated by the separation of the two lovers and the second section to the death of Teresa. This lapse does not diminish the total impact; on the contrary, sentimental content increases with the interval, revealing the vastly different reactions of the poet to the two most painful jolts of his existence. In the first part, Espronceda dwells upon the remembered happiness of a shared love; in the second, he laments the loss of this love and rails against the beloved. The twenty-fith strophe synthesizes this interpretation thus: Tú fuiste un tiempo cristalino río, Manantial de purísima limpieza; Después torrente de color sombrío, Rompiendo entre peñascos y maleza, y estanque, en fin, de aguas corrompidas, Entre fétido fango detenidas. (1694-1699) The last division best characterizes the mood of the entire poem even though it appears as a contrast to the initial segment. Whereas in the first section the lovers longings for a pure and eternal love appear, in the final portion the poet's disillusionment and vitupera- tion of the loved one for not possessing at once the qualities of Aphrodite and Madonna are most memorable. Such is the form taken by the reconsideration of the constant struggle between Es- pronceda's inner self and the outer world. The poet's egotism cannot be overstated. Espronceda weeps more at the impossibility of ful- filling his own desires than for the death of Teresa, dead for him when she ceased to be the ideal woman. He damns her yet is unable to forget her; his heart is wounded but not free of her. He says as much in the first strophe, thus continuing the love-hate</page><page sequence="7">198 ROMANCE NOTES antilogy. Espronceda intends thereby to be as cruel with her as he avers she was with him in revealing herself as only human. In his passionate, blind egocentrism the poet subjugates every concept of woman and love to one aspect which allows no modification: the candid and beatiful woman, a celestial creature of pure fantasy, too perfect to be real. Naturally, the imagined beauty will turn to dust when the poet discovers the Edenie caste - poisoned by the apple and the serpent - of his beloved. The sin attributed to her, alluded to in the antepenultimate strophe is, then, not only Eve's own, but the defraudation of the poet: the beloved turns out to be neither god-like nor virginal. Espronceda tries in many ways to reduce human existence ex- clusively to the amorous dimension, since in the mind of many Romantics love can redeem man. Zorrilla's don Juan, rescued from the eternal flames by his sincere love for Inés, is a case in point. But Espronceda always found exiguous for his thirst the love within his grasp. He was not satisfied, because he could never satiate his wants with mediocre reality. Love having failed him as a means whereby to rescue his existence from banality, Espronceda aban- doned himself to follow cynically and indifferently the course of the world around him. This explains why not only the "Canto a Teresa" but other poems including "A una estrella" and "Jarifa" end on a note of wounded indifference. For the poet, powerless against the world, there remains only the sleep of the sepulchre or drifting with the current like other mortals since all struggle with fate is futile. The climax of such an attitude is the empty defiance of the last verse, "Que haya un cadáver más, ¡qué importa al mun- do!" (1851), whose pained sarcasm is all too obvious. In his poetry Espronceda is unable to reconcile his views of the world. Not does he know how to orient his own life in order to harmonize his inner world - which nurtures his poetry - with ex- ternal reality, and so it follows that continuity and intermittence can be jointly observed in his life as well as in his work. He remains unaware of how to adapt himself to the reality in which he must dwell. The resultant shock of the encounter between the two worlds produces an enduring sorrow, making him pessimistic, darkening his verse. His disenchantment with life is thus not surprising. The dissatisfaction of a Romantic spirit such as Espronceda's stems from</page><page sequence="8">THE WHORE-MADONNA IN THE POETRY OF ESPRONCEDA 199 that stance which arbitrarily pretended to reduce all meaning to an extremely subjective and personal vantage point, producing a ca- pricious tedium, a universal skepticism and damnation of the woman beloved.
