Pp. 168. $35 (paper). Thj al-Din Abu'l-Fath Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Karlim al- Shahrastan! (d. 548/1153) was one of the most learned theolo- gians of his time. He is generally recognized as a Shdfi'!- Ash'arl Sunni scholar, well versed in philosophical traditions, and as the author of a famous book on religions and Islamic sects, the Kitab al-Milal wa'l-nihal. But in recent decades, modem scholarship has brought to light a new aspect of this enigmatic and original Muslim thinker's thought. In particular, by analyzing three of his works, including the Majlis, his only extant Persian treatise reproduced in the volume under review mainly from the critical edition prepared by Muhammad RidI Jaldl! NW'in! together with an annotated French translation and introduction, a number of scholars including Diane Steiger- wald, have argued convincingly that al-Shahrastini was in fact a crypto-Ismaili. Al-Shahrastini was a contemporary of Hasan-i Sabbaih (d. 518/1124), the founder of the Nizirl da'wa in Persia. The</page><page sequence="2">644 Journal of the American Oriental Society 122.3 (2002) early Nizarl dd'is were particularly active in Khurdsan, al- Shahrastani's native land where he also became a close associ- ate of the SaljUq sultan Sanjar. In fact, several of al-Shahra- stani's contemporary Sunni scholars such as al-Sam'mn! (d. 562/1166) do report that he inclined towards the Ismailis and their teachings. We also have the valuable testimony of the well-informed Nasir al-Din al-TUs! who, in his spiritual auto- biography (Sayr wa sulak), refers to al-Shahrastan! with the Ismaili title of the da'i al-ducat, a significant appellation even if used purely in an honorific sense. Be that as it may, al- Shahrastan! doubtless had contacts with Nizdrl Ismaili da'is and was familiar with the Ismaili teachings of both the Fatimid and AlamUt periods, which he categorized respectively as the "old preaching" (al-da'wa al-qadima) and "new preaching" (al-da'wa al-jadida). That he had direct access to Ismaili lit- erature is attested by the fact that Hasan-i Sabb1h's major theo- logical treatise, the Fusil al-arba'a, which has not survived, is preserved fragmentarily in al-Shahrastani's Kitab al-Milal wa'l- nihal (ed. W. Cureton [London, 1842-46], 150-52). At any rate, al-Shahrastdni's Majlis, as well as his Qur'dn commentary, the Mafatih al-asrir, and his Kitab al-Musdraca in which he refutes Avicenna's metaphysics on the basis of Ismaili views and arguments, clearly reflect Ismaili perspec- tives. The Majlis, on the two worlds of order (amr) and crea- tion (khalq), was originally delivered as a sermon around the year 540/1145 to a Twelver Shi'i audience in Khwarazm. In this theological-philosophical-mystical sermon, al-Shahrastan! expounds a cosmological doctrine that bears close affinities to the Neoplatonized Ismaili cosmology propounded by AbM Ya'qub al-Sijistan! and other Ismaili dd'is operating in Iranian lands, especially in Khurasan, during the Fatimid period. This brief text of some thirty printed pages is also permeated with Qur'anic verses and hadiths for which al-Shahrastani provides esoteric interpretations through the methodology of ta'wil associated particularly with the Ismailis-a methodology fully used in his Qur'an commentary written a few years earlier than the Majlis. A few examples from the Majlis, which deals with creation, prophecy and Shi'i-related notions of guidance, would serve to show how extensively al-Shahrastdni was influenced by Ismaili teachings. Similarly to the Iranian Ismaili dd'is, he expounds the absolute transcendence of God beyond being and non-being, and beyond comprehension by human reason. As a result, he levels harsh criticisms at the Mu'tazila, the Ash'arls and other theological schools for compromising the unity of God through anthropomorphism (tashbih) or by denying God any attributes (ta'til) (pp. 92, 98-99). This concept of God's transcendence is more fully developed in the Kitb al-Musd- ra'a, where al-Shahrastani refutes the alternative Avicennan concept of the wajib al-wujud, or God as the "Necessary Being." Again, in line with the position of the Ismailis, for al- Shahrastani, too, the divine order, or amr, acts as an inter- mediary between God and His creation, or khalq (pp. 80-81); he also adheres to the Ismaili distinctions between the spirit- ual world, the 'alam al-amr, corresponding to the calam al- ibda' of Ismaili cosmogony, and the physical world, the calam al-khalq. In his treatment of prophecy (nubuwwa), and the process of guidance (hidayat) needed by human beings, al-Shahrastani draws on the Ismaili cyclical conception of time and prophetic eras (pp. 84-86); and, throughout the Majlis, he presents angels as intermediaries in creation and prophets and their successors (the ilu'l-amrs and imams) as intermediaries in guidance. Thus, he argues, in a Shi'i-Ismaili sense, for the necessity of guidance by imams. Reflecting more specifically Nizdr! influences, he introduces the figure of qadim and de- picts 'All b. Ab! Tdlib as such an eschatological figure (pp. 87, 93-94, 109). As it is known, the Nizdris of the Alamrit period taught that starting with 'All every imam was potentially an imam-qa'im. The Majlis sermon concludes with a mystical disputation between Moses and the Qur'dnic figure Khidr (pp. 101-7), another figure of importance in Nizar! thought. Later, the Nizdrls identified Khidr with Dhu'l-Qarnayn, the imam- qadim of the prophetic era initiated by Moses. All this explains why the Majlis has been listed as an Ismaili work in I. K. Poonawala's Biobibliography of Ismd'ili Literature ([Malibu, Calif., 1977], 256). A closer study of the Majlis and other Ismaili-inspired works of al-Shahrastani will be invaluable not only for appre- ciating the complex religious thought of this scholar and his intellectual heritage, but also for a better understanding of the doctrines of the Nizdrl Ismailis of the Alamit period whose literature has perished almost completely. Diane Steigerwald has rendered great service in offering this volume, which now makes the Persian text of the Majlis more readily accessible while her excellent annotated French translation, appearing on opposite pages, contextualizes al-Shahrastdni's thought and draws attention to parallels in Ismaili sources.
