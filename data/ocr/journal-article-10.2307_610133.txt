<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUFISM IN SOMALILAND: A STUDY IN TRIBAL ISLAM-II By I. M. LEWIS III. CUSHITIC RELIGION N the first part of this study we followed the development of the Sufi tariqa organization in Somaliland after the introduction of Islam and examined the functions exercised by Sufi communities in the social structure. We interpreted the closer social and genealogical assimilation of jama'as among the nomadic tribes in terms of lack of arable land available for the foundation of independent settlements. It was argued that the genealogical idiom in which social relations are normally described, especially amongst the nomads, is extended to the jamd'as by virtue of their identification with the Arabian genealogies of their sheiks. The incorporation of such Suifi genealogies was held to explain how the Somali lineage system is in its furthest extension extrapolated to the Qurayshitic lineage of the Prophet. Sufi and Somali tribal genealogies, it was suggested, have parallel religious functions which make such assimilation possible. In the light of these similarities of religious function, and, in order to provide a theological framework for the discussion of syncretism which concludes this essay, it will be necessary to make some attempt to compare pre-Islamic and Islamic Somali theology. This should reveal the factors which underlie the rise of Sufism in Somaliland. The present account of Cushitic religion in Somaliland is limited mainly to the Hawiye tribes of southern Somalia. Cushitic features of Hawiye belief and practice have been recorded in some detail by Cerulli; information on the northern Somali is scanty and much less satisfactory. Religion only will be considered and pre-Islamic customs such as the levirate, sororate, circumcision and infibulation, etc., which are not specifically religious and do not in them- selves elucidate religious concepts will be ignored. As has been emphasized, Islam is interpreted through the medium of the earlier Cushitic substratum which is being continuously modified and progressively Islamized. In the present context it is not necessary to go into the racial history of Somaliland 1 in any detail beyond recalling that, even prior to the twelfth century,2 the Somali had begun their southern expansion at the expense of their Galla (Cushitic) predecessors. As the Galla withdrew before the advancing Somali, they took much of their common Cushitic culture with them, while the Somali increasingly adopted Islam. Islam had, as we have seen, made its appearance in the coastal centres shortly after the Hejira. However, there are still to-day a few tribes which preserve much of their Cushitic culture unmodified by Muslim influence. The Hawiye retain sufficient of their old religion to indicate its general characteristics. 1 For a tentative account see Lewis, 1955, 45-8. 2 See Huntingford, 1955, 19. VOL. XVIII. PART 1. 12</page><page sequence="2">I. M. LEWIS Zar and Waaq The Supreme Being of Cushitic religion is a Sky God who is regarded as Father of the universe. The entire world of nature, including man and his possessions, is ultimately God's. The root-name for the Sky God may be Zdr, since, according to Cerulli (1923, p. 2) Zdr occurs in this context with only slight modifications in most Cushitic languages and is the form used among the pagan Agao whose religion has been taken as the archetype of Cushitic religion (cf. Ullendorff, 1955, pp. 63-4). Since, however, comparative study of the Cushitic languages is in its infancy this theory is uncertain. Among the northern Somali Eebbe (Father) is a common name for God-now Allah-and among the Hawiye of the south the word used is Waaq (cf. Galla, Waaqa 1). Waaq in northern Somaliland occurs in certain obscure expletives but is not generally used to designate God. Zdr itself appears to occur in the form Saar, which, as we shall see, connotes a spirit-refraction accreted to Islam as a malignant jinn. Eebbe and Waaq are now, of course, applied to Allah, and these Cushitic names and their derivatives are still found as personal and place-names. God's exalted position is indicated in the songs addressed to Him. ' Children are Yours, women Yours, cattle Yours.' 'If You are pleased with our fine horses, take them. If our slaves please You, take them, and if our wives find favour in Your sight take them also.' God is apprehended as He watches over creation in the sun's light, just as man is aware of his surroundings through the gift of sight. Prayers run: 'Watch us God, You who have eyes, know and we shall know, for after You have known we know '.2 'Knowledge is Yours, sight is Yours, watch us with good eyes. Make us see well. Sight is Yours.' The semantic relation is eyes, seeing, sun, and light. God's eternal constancy is compared to the central-pole of the hut. ' May the central-pole be as of iron.' Without support man's house collapses, but God, ' the same without the central- pole', is full of wonder and power. Somali still sing 'This Sky, the same un- changing, without the central-pole according to the Divine Will' (Cerulli, op. cit.). The Sky God's belt is the rainbow, and the rains are in his keeping as a gift for man; certain individuals have power over the rains through their relation to God. Saar in Somali describes a state of possession by a spirit also called saar. The extreme symptoms are frenzy, fits, or madness, and the spirit itself is, in the Islamic setting, described as a kind of jinn whose malignant powers cause certain types of sickness. Among the eastern tribes of northern Somaliland 'invisible ' wadaad (see above) act similarly to saar but have less serious effects and are merely responsible for some minor forms of illness. Saar can be expelled by persons who have acquired mastery over the spirits through having them- selves been previously possessed. In northern Somaliland such 'doctors' (alaqa) are generally women, for visitation is here confined almost exclusively 1 For an excellent account of the religion of the Galla of Ethiopia see Huntingford, 1955 74-87. 2 cf. Koran, Sura ii, 30. 146</page><page sequence="3">SUFISM IN SOMALILAND: A STUDY IN TRIBAL ISLAM-II to this sex, especially to the wealthy. Rich women who believe that a saar is troubling them have recourse to an alaqa: poor women cannot afford to be afflicted by saar because treatment is costly. Such an illogical situation leads sceptical Somalis to abandon their belief in saar. This is not the place nor is there at present sufficient material on the social contexts in which saar are active, to enter into a sociological discussion of the subject. It seems possible, however, that we are concerned with a form of the witchcraft which is associated with wealth and polygamy elsewhere and which serves as a vehicle for jealousy and as a buttress of social status. Saar are expelled in the ' dance of the saar ' which is apparently fairly extensively practised in Somalia although violently opposed by Muslim wadaad. In northern Somaliland, where official opposition is such that many devout Muslims deny its existence,' the dance is sometimes still performed by women. It seems that the dance acts as a form of exorcism of the malevolent jinn causing possession, and perhaps less frequently as a means of attaining possession. In Somalia, the opening movement is called or-goys and consists of those assembled beginning to sing and to raise their arms rhythmically towards the sky. Soon someone falls in a faint and his companions ' beat the saar ', forming a circle round him and breaking into ' the song of the saar ', sung at first slowly and then with increasing tempo. Drumming, castanet- playing, and handclapping swell the singing. Slowly the fallen dancer revives, and moving his limbs in rhythm, seizes a knife or lighted brand which he thrusts between his teeth and dances into the semi-circle formed by the others. The tempo increases until the dancer again succumbs and falls panting to the ground. After a little he rises completely restored and the saar is said to have left him.2 The dance is widely distributed among the Cushitic peoples of north-east Africa and often the possessed dancer acts as an oracle 3 (see Leiris, 1934). Beyond the Cushitic areas, it occurs as far away as Egypt (Kahle, 1912), the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (Trimingham, 1949, pp. 174-7), and even the Hijaz (Hurgronje, 1888-9, II, pp. 124-8). The explanation seems to be that the saar (Zar) dance has spread far beyond the bounds of Cushitic culture with the export of slaves from Ethiopia where it has its Cushitic origin (Cerulli, 1933, ii, p. 35). Other Religious Concepts The realm of the Sky God includes a multitude of subsidiary spirits; the spirits of the bush, certain animals, some snakes, scorpions, termites, and other insects frequently credited by Somali with malignant powers. In 1 In fact in 1955 the British Somaliland Protectorate Advisory Council unanimously agreed that legislation should be introduced to make the practice of saar rites illegal. War Somali Sidihi, No. 60, 23 April 1955. 2 Among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in northern Ethiopia, the refractions of the Sky God (Zdr) which possess people are called zdr, are associated especially but not exclusively with women, are inherited in the family, and have genealogies corresponding to their territorial distribution (Leiris, 1934 (1), 134, 126). 3 The Afar (Danakil) of southern Eritrea and of Ethiopia have a similar ceremony in which the possessed dancer is called jenile (jinn ?). See Licata, 1885, 267; Thesiger, 1935, 8. 147</page><page sequence="4">I. M. LEWIS certain situations tribes are described as linked to trees and animals which are addressed by maternal kinship names, but the connexion does not appear to be totemic. Spirit-refractions are said to have their seats in those possessed, and, among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in Ethiopia the spirit-ridden subject is referred to as the spirit's 'horse'. A similar spirit is encountered and over- come in the crossing the threshold ceremony (kalaqaad) which marks a male child's first expedition outside his mother's hut. The baby is carried over the threshold by his mother's brother (Cerulli, 1919, p. 23). Although generally obscured by and syncreted in Islam, divining and various forms of sympathetic magic are still practised. Ordeals and oath-taking by swearing on stones are used to establish testimony. Charms and amulets, especially as prophylactics, enjoy wide popularity. Their efficacy, now, of course, depends upon associa- tion with the Holy Koran. In this context it is perhaps not irrelevant to mention the fire-kindling ceremony of dabshid which is widely observed and marks the commencement of the solar year.1 The festival is condoned in some parts of Somalia by representing it as a Muslim expiatory rite; in one district it is known as the ' feast of beating '. In southern Somaliland death is regarded as a transformation. In the grave the corpse lies clothed and provided with a supply of food. The dead are remembered in periodical ceremonies (' sweeping the tomb') at which cattle are slaughtered and food distributed amongst the poor, slaves and servants, and the aged. Gifts of food and clothes are sometimes offered, often in response to dreams. 'I dreamt that my father showed me his torn clothes. Here are some clothes, let him take them.' Or again, 'I have given my dead mother an ox, now my father is thin and hungry and wants something to fatten him. Here is another ox, let him come and take it'. Old men are constantly pre- occupied in amassing their wah la-i-gu dugo (what is buried with me) and, according to Cerulli, on occasion set aside as much as three-quarters of their inheritance for the performance of' sweeping the tomb ' ceremonies after their death. Sacrifice (Waaq da'il, Rabbibari) plays, as we have seen, an important part in the life of the Somali. From the structural point of view its crucial form is the annual celebration held at the tombs of the founding ancestors of lineages. The assimilation within Islam of this, the most vital aspect of sacrifice in relation to the lineage system, will be discussed below. To recapitulate: a brief description has been given of the Cushitic world of power manifest in an apparently incoherent and rather vague hierarchy of refractions of the Sky God (Waaq). This world presided over by God comprises the phenomena which we call 'natural'; the sun, moon, and stars, the winds, rainbow, rains, and the rest, as well as the more contiguous parts of nature, the hills, trees, and water, which make up man's immediate surroundings. Certain configurations of these phenomena are fraught with power, available sometimes to ritual experts only, sometimes to whoever chances to cross their path. One of the tribal religious expert's (wadaad) special skills is his knowledge 1 See Lewis, 1955, 62. 148</page><page sequence="5">SUFISM IN SOMALILAND: A STUDY IN TRIBAL ISLAM-II of the skies and power to interpret the movements of the heavenly bodies (Cerulli, 1929, 1931 (2)). But power appears too in the interaction of the more remote phenomena of the skies with man's immediate environment. At Lugh- Ferrandi in Somalia, for example, the moon is believed to set in a clump of tamarind bushes and whoever is touched by a falling leaf as the moon disappears will die (Ferrandi, 1903, p. 300). Many similar examples could be cited. Apart from individual, chance, and private, rather than collective, relations with the world of power, such as those indicated and, for example, in the saar dance, the influence of God appears at a higher structural level and correspondingly higher potential in tribal sacrifice. We have already noticed how the religious nature of chieftaincy is established in sacrifice and how a chief may have powers of rainmaking. The chief was seen to have a special relation with God. From his sanctity follows his power to bless and curse his people and the force of the fire within him which makes his glance 'the burning eye' (il kulul). IV. SUFISM AND SYNCRETISM Sufism and the SharV'a Muslim mystical theosophy may be regarded as embodying the vital and flexible spirit of Islam. Like all mysticism Sufism concentrates on the personal relationship between the believer and God, and must be regarded by those who consider that the core of religion is to be found in an 'I-Thou' relationship as the mainspring of Islam. The Shari'a-the law of the Islamic community- originated in a theocracy which had transcended the bonds of tribalism, and has in its subsequent elaboration always referred (in theory at least) to a religious state. That part of the Shari'a which relates only to purely ritual or religious observance applies equally well to tribe or state because it deals with the relations of the believer to God, but the sectors of the Shari'a which elaborate a corpus of private and public law based upon the concept of citizenship are not applicable, save with major limitations, to a stateless tribal society.l The ecological dichotomy reflected in the divergence between nomadism and sedentary cultivation in Somaliland, which as we have seen, is ultimately responsible for the two different types ofjamd'a organization-dependence and identification in the case of the nomads, independence from tribal allegiance and less close assimilation in the case of the cultivators-operates in the same sense here. In the urban centres of the coast and in the arable lands of the south where the lineage principle has largely disintegrated, the purely legal as opposed to purely religious-to make a separation which in traditional Islam is largely artificial-ordinances of the Shari'a naturally have wider jurisdiction.2 But 1 It would be misleading to overemphasize the significance of this distinction, since, except in the earliest centuries of Islam there has always been a wide divergence between the theory and practice of the Sharl'a in all Muslim countries. 2 This is reflected, perhaps fortuitously, in the extent to which the qddi's competence in the administration of the Shari'a has been recognized by the Governments of British and Italian Somaliland. In Somalia qddzs have a limited jurisdiction in criminal proceedings, while in British Somaliland criminal cases are expressly excluded from their jurisdiction. See Lewis, 1955, 124; Anderson, 1954, 43 ff. For the Arabs, cf. Montagne, 1947, 96. 149</page><page sequence="6">amongst the nomadic Somali the application of the Shari'a 1 tends to be restricted to intra-tribal affairs and certain matters of personal status. Its relevance outside this narrow field is, of course, recognized by the tribesman but is not always upheld in practice. Even within the tribe, the jurisdiction of the Shari'a is limited by the force of tribal custom (heer, tastuur)-not an unusual situation in the Muslim world. It is true that the recognition given to the Shari'a in the British and Italian judicial systems provides an extended mechanism for the regulation of external tribal relations. Thus the Shari'a is one of the sources of the law in the settlement of tribal disputes although the case may not be heard in a qddW's court. There are, however, many wadaad issuing from the tar7qas who practise as qadis outside the governmental judicial structure. The scope of their application of the Shari'a, although supported by strong religious sanctions, is limited by the power of the tribal chiefs. This state of affairs represents the traditional social order before the advent of the Pax Britannica or the Pax Italiana. Despite these differences in the jurisdiction allowed to the Shari'a, there is little difference between the nomads and culti- vators in the importance attached to the fundamental principles of Islam. Except for a few tribes who have remained relatively sheltered from Muslim influence, the five ' Pillars of the Faith '-the profession of the Faith; prayers; fasting, somewhat irregularly observed perhaps; almsgiving; and pilgrimage- seem to be universally practised. Competent witnesses have generally been struck by the devoutness of the Somali tribesman. There is, of course, no opposition between Sufism as a movement and the schools of Muslim law, but the material reviewed in this essay suggests that S. fi theosophy-as opposed to the Shari'a-is in its basic principles particularly suited to Somali society. These principles have been firmly assimilated while what in the Shari'a is inapplicable to a tribal society has been largely ignored. The further penetration of Islam and the Shari'a is opposed and retarded by the barrier of tribal custom, part but not all of which relates directly to the lineage organization whose interaction with Islam we have been considering. On the other hand, various customs, which appear to have no necessary con- nexion with the lineage system nor to be essential to nomadism, persist and resist the full application of the Shari'a. On the whole, however, Somali society has interpreted Islamic institutions in the light of its own tribal structure and has produced the Sufi organization which I have outlined. But it would be wrong to argue that because Somali tribalism is opposed to the application of the Shari'a the only possible response is Sufism. The difference between the 1 According to Cucinotta, 1921 (1), 34, the important sources of Shari'a in Somalia are: al-Nawawi's Minhaj at-Tdlibfn; the works of Isma'il Muqri (Brockelmann, GAL, II, 190; Suppt., ii, 254), and of Abui Ishaq ash-Shirazi (0.

Subsidiary sources are: Ibn al-Qasim al-Ghazzi's Fath al-GharTb; Abfu Yahya Zakariya' al-Ansari's Fath al- Wahhdb (Brockelmann, GAL, I, 395-6), and Muhammad ash-Shirbini's al-Iqnd'fi hall al Fatb (Brockelmann, GAL, Suppt., II, 441 if.).

LEWIS</page><page sequence="7">SUFISM IN SOMALILAND: A STUDY IN TRIBAL ISLAM-II theory and application of the Shari'a has always been considerable, in state as well as tribe. The suitability of Sufism to the conditions of Somali society is much more important than the impracticality of part of the Shari'a. We turn now to consider the adoption of Sufism in terms of the assimilation of Suifi theosophy to Somali pre-Islamic belief. The Nature of God and His World Although clearly delineated with greater precision, the absolute supremacy of Allah (indicated in the believer's submission (Islam) to Him) closely resembles the omnipotence of the Sky God. As in the cult of Waaq, men are God's creatures subject to His Will and must live in constant fear of Him and praise Him always. Similarly to Waaq, Allah stands at the centre of His universe as its Supreme Power and Creator. The Muslim doctrine of determinism finds its crude parallel in the attitude of submission and resignation in the face of Waaq. But Muslim fatalism is more rigidly determined and more elaborately worked out, since man's actions are predetermined and set down in the tablet which is before God, similar to that Divine Archetype from which the Koran was delivered to the Prophet. The same tendency towards a greater systematiza- tion in Islam finds expression in the much more clearly defined position of Allah in the awarding of right and punishment of evil. Waaq upholds right but there is little indication that He does much more. Muslim eschatology accordingly strikes a new note. Death was a transformation but not to an exact equivalent of the anthropomorphic Muslim paradise. Formerly the spirits of the dead were to a certain extent localized about the sites of their tombs. We shall examine below the way in which this affects the reverence paid by Somali to the tombs of Muslim saints. Fundamentally, however, man's relation to Waaq closely mirrors his relation to Allah and it is hardly surprising that Somali should now apply the names of the former Cushitic Sky* God to Allah and call Him Eebbe and Waaq. The fact that Islam is a ' revealed religion ' appears at first sight to constitute a fundamental difference between the two religions. But whereas there is apparently nothing in the cult of Waaq comparable to the tradition of revela- tion of Allah to the earlier prophets and finally to Mohammed as the 'Seal', Sufi theology has concentrated on those texts and traditions 1 referring to the immanence of God in the world and has interpreted these as justifying a continued revelation and more immediate knowledge of Allah. In Sufism, emphasis has veered from the position of the Sunna towards an interpretation of the Prophet's role as that of logos, and the approach to Allah has been correspondingly widened. The approach to God, first through the Prophet, and then through Sufi sheiks and saints, finds its parallel in the association of sacrifice to Waaq with lineage ancestors. Comparison of the pre-Islamic Somali spirit-world with Muslim angelology 1 For a readily accessible compilation of 4adfths used by Sufifs as a basis for their ascetic and theosophical interpretation of theology see Arberry, 1950, 24-30. 151</page><page sequence="8">I. M. LEWIS and demonology reveals again the much higher degree of systematization in the latter. In Muslim theology, angels, pre-eminent amongst whom is Gabriel, generally figure as Divine Messengers created by God to serve and worship Him. They are charged with recording man's actions in this life, receiving his soul in heaven, and acting as his counsel on the day of judgment. On the other hand, jinn are those rebellious spirits created similarly to man, but of fire in place of earth, and committed to Solomon's keeping, who seek to lead man astray and to subvert the teachings of the prophets. It is as jinn that the majority of pre-Islamic spirits previously associated with Waaq are assimilated in Islam. This is illustrated in the following tale current among the Gasar Gudda tribe of Somalia. 'Solomon, son of David, on whom be peace, commanded all men, all the animals, the wind, spirits, and demons, the entire kingdom of the Great King. One day the jinn were at work as usual, and Solomon, leaning against a tree, seemed to be watching them although he gave no sign of repose. Solomon was dead, but remained supported by the tree while the jinn unaware of what had happened went on with their work. At last the termites succeeded in eating their way through Solomon's support precipitating him heavily on to the ground. The jinn quickly ran to the spot and saw that the son of David was dead. They began to rejoice for now they could stop working since their master was dead. They hastened to the termites and made a pact with them, saying, " You make your nest of earth and we will bring the water for its strengthening ". From this time forth jinn and termites are in alliance' (Ferrandi, 1903, p. 309). Here within Islam the spirits attendant upon the mysterious construction of termite mounds are associated withjinn in Solomon's keeping. The relation' spirits-termites' is given Muslim sanction in Solomon's authority over jinn. Similarly the source of the efficacy of divination, ordeals, charms, and prophylactic amulets has been transferred from Waaq to Allah when beneficent and to jinn when mischievous or evil. Now the favourite amulet is the Sufi rosary (tusbah) whose 99 beads remind the believer of the innumerable praise-names of Allah and help him to perform his prayer-tasks. Perhaps equally popular as amulets are small leather pouches armed with inscriptions from the Koran. Thus phenomena which formerly owed their power to some connexion with Waaq now originate in Alldh, the ultimate source of all power.1 Saar spirits are described by Somali as a kind of jinn. The whole spirit hierarchy of Waaq is being progressively Islamized. This is a process which naturally also applies to God's attributes. Among the Gasar Gudda, again, the rainbow, from being the Sky God's belt, has become the path good souls take to heaven, although it is also contended by some to be the smoke made by rain falling upon termite hills. Rain-drops are believed to turn into angels (an understandable evaluation); thunder (uri) is the voice of angels (malaika) or the noise of their combat in striving to stop rain. Lightning 1 cf. the fate of the pre-Islamic Gods and spirits in Arabia, Koran, Sura xxxvI.

These are a few examples indicative of the way in which the Muslim spirit hierarchy is understood in terms of Cushitic cosmology. The sab in Islam The traditions which surround the outcast artisan peoples of Somaliland provide illuminating material for the study of the interaction of pre-Islamic and Muslim religion. The sab : Yibir, Tumaal, Midgaan, etc., leather-workers, saddlers, smiths, and 'sweepers', who act as hunters and mercenaries, and perform other menial tasks for Somalis, are shrouded in an aura of magic and witchcraft. Their position lies between that of freedom and slavery and they may perhaps be described most appropriately as bondsmen. They lack almost all those rights common to freeborn Somali (Lewis, 1955, pp. 51-5). They have no political rights vis-a-vis Somalis, they own no tribal lands, and in no place do they constitute an independent territorial group. In all their relations with freeborn Somalis they act through the noble Somali family to which they are attached as servants. They are separated from freemen by the usual barriers to commensalism. sab are also supposed to speak amongst themselves special dialects which are hardly intelligible to freeborn Somali. Because of their habit of eating portions of meat (head, tripe, and feet) which noble Somali scorn and class with pork as unclean in a religious sense, they are branded as being in a perpetual state of ritual impurity (nijaas). For the same reason they are often referred to as ' corpse-eaters ' (bakhti'une). Of this despised class the Yibir are especially interesting. They enjoy a high reputation for magic and sorcery and wander through the country blessing newly born children and newly wedded couples. They receive in return small gifts which are recognized to be due to them by right and could only be refused at the risk of incurring grave misfortune. These presents made to Yibir are represented by Somali as part of the compensation owing to them in perpetuity for the murder of their ancestor Muhammad H.anif by Sheik Au Barkhadle.2 Sheik Au Barkhadle is associated with Sheik Ishaaq, founder of the Ishaaq tribal family, as one of those who brought Islam to Somaliland from Arabia. In fact, according to tradition, he was summoned to Somaliland to deal with the pagan magician Muhammad Hanif. The Yibir ancestor was tricked into entering a mound which Au Barkhadle's superior powers caused to collapse imprisoning the unfortunate magician inside. Thus in this context was the pre-eminence of Islam established. Associated with the mysterious disappearance of their ancestor is the belief that no one has ever seen a dead Yibir.3 These traditions describing the origin 1 Ferrandi, 1903, 298 ff. 2 Ceruli, RAL, ser. 6, iv, 1931, 67, has suggested that Saint Au Barkhadle (' Au Bakhardi '), whose tomb at the site named after the sheik is a favourite place of pilgrimage of the Habr Awal tribe, may be identified with Yuisuf Barkatla, ancestor of 'Umar Walashma', founder of the Ifit dynasty. For the position of the tomb see Drake-Brockman, 1912, 217 if. 3 The Yibir ancestor bears, in point of name and circumstance, some superficial resemblance to the Shi'ite 'hidden' Imdm Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiya. 153</page><page sequence="10">I. M. LEWIS of the customary gifts to Yibir are to a certain extent inconsistent with present practice inasmuch as normally an unattached Yibir is not covered by blood- compensation. But it is significant that what is feared and what is revered should be attributed to a common origin in which pagan sorcery is overcome by Muslim baraka. Saar Rites and Dhikr To return to the saar dance. It is evident that this ceremony has inherent susceptibility to syncretism in the services (dhikr) of the Suffi tartqas. Especially is this true of the most popular forms of the dhikr, where trance states in which 'fading' or 'death' of self, believed to result in mystical union with God, are induced by direct stimulation. The dhikr held by the Ahmediya at their annual pilgrimage to the tomb of Sheik Ali Maye Durogba have been described as follows. 'Thousands come to the tomb from all parts of Somalia. The festival lasts fifteen days and culminates in a great dhikr on the last night when the pilgrims form an immense circle and, to the accompaniment of singing, recite their formulae in raucous saw-like voices rhythmically swaying their bodies. This continues until day-break. Once they have got well worked-up, large numbers fall foaming to the ground in induced epileptic convulsions' (Barile, 1935). This is neither an informed nor a sympathetic description but it serves to indicate how closely the tar7qa dhikr resembles the saar dance and suggests a syncretism which is well established in Egypt and elsewhere.1 The similarities between the attainment of spirit possession (or the release from possession) and absorption in Allah which are the objects of the dance and the dhikr respectively have already been pointed out. The Assimilation of Baraka In the foregoing various aspects of the conversion of spirit-refractions of Waaq to Muslim equivalents have been discussed. These are variations upon the general principle of the translation of Cushitic power into Muslim baraka.2 From the functional standpoint the most fundamental application of this exchange is that underlying the absorption of Su.fi genealogies which leads ultimately, as I have suggested, to the inclusive ascription of the Somali people to the Qurayshitic lineage of the Prophet. For it is this equivalence which permits Muslim saints to be venerated and communed with in sacrifice and prayer at the sites of former pre-Islamic shrines. Shrines which were formerly venerated for their Cushitic power are now venerated for their Muslim baraka. These are the places which famous Somali Muslim saints are believed to have visited in their peregrinations or at which they are believed to have appeared to believers in dreams. Tombs are scattered all over Somaliland and more of them are places of manifestation or visitation than the actual burial grounds of the saints whose baraka is sought in pilgrimage to them. Thus as in all Muslim 1 See Massignon, Enc. Is., iv, 668. 2 Among the Christian and Muslim Agao of Gondar this syncretism leads to the coexistence of Zar Abba Yusef (Christian) and Zar Sheik Muh.ammad (Muslim); Leiris, 1934 (1), 126-9. 154</page><page sequence="11">SUFISM IN SOMALILAND : A STUDY IN TRIBAL ISLAM-II countries, old shrines continue to command respect although the source of their power has been transferred to Islam. The veneration of saints' tombs has, however, a more specific significance since it is through sacrifice to eponymous ancestors at such local shrines that tribal relations were maintained with Waaq at all levels of the social structure. Moreover, the emphasis placed on genealogies and the importance attached to eponymous ancestors, celebrated at their tombs, have promoted and continue to promote the adoption of Sufi genealogies and the transfiguration of the founders of tartqas and jamr'as into eponymous tribal founders. Thus within Islam the ancestors of clans and clan segments are represented as saints or sheiks, while the whole system is validated in the attribution of Somali origins to immigrant Arabians, in the case of tribal families, to figures such as Ishaaq and Daarood. This process, in turn, is facili- tated by the continuous immigration of Arabs which provides the historical component in Somali traditions of descent from Arabia. This short discussion of Cushitic religion and its Islamization has been included to provide a framework for the study of Somali and Sufi institutions which forms the substance of this paper. The apparent similarity of the concepts of Cushitic power, immanent in Somali genealogies, and baraka, immanent in Suifi genealogies, which attach to the institutions of sacrifice to founding tribal ancestors and to saint worship respectively, underlies the transfiguration of tribal founders into Islamic saints. The organization of both cults depends upon a lineage system in which religious power of a similar nature inheres. It has seemed appropriate to investigate the nature of the power inherent in Somali genealogies (independent of Sufi accretion) by viewing it in the general setting of the pre-Islamic hierarchy of Cushitic power. The spirit-refractions of Waaq could hardly be supposed to bear no relation to the religious functions of Somali genealogies and the significance of these genealogies is, as we have seen, elucidated by considering their functions in Cushitic religion. The persistence of pre-Islamic beliefs and customs is a commonplace in Islamic countries. In particular, the syncretism of pre-Islamic 'animistic' cults is frequently described in the literature on Islam. The assimilation of such cults to Muslim baraka is well attested. There is therefore nothing new in the general scope of this essay. But it has been my object to try to trace in detail the mechanism of this assimilation in relation to Sufism on the one hand, and, on the other, to the lineage organization which is the basic principle of Somali social organization. I have suggested, and I believe this could be substantiated by reference to many other parts of Muslim Africa and to Arabia, that Sufism although in origin a product of the sophisticated and highly civilized centres of the Muslim world, is eminently suitable to tribal society. Especially is this true of certain features of its religious organization. In tribal societies where stress is placed upon the power of lineage ancestors to mediate between man and God, Sufism provides an interpretation of Islam which, while preserving the supreme absoluteness of Allh, mitigates the uniqueness of the Prophet in favour of more accessible and more immediate intercessors. 155</page><page sequence="12">I.
