<plain_text><page sequence="1">H. D. SANKALIA THE NUDE GODDESS OR "SHAMELESS WOMAN" IN WESTERN ASIA, INDIA, AND SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA* N Tude, or semi-nude female figures are not new to India. The question here is the intro- duction of certain specific types into Indian art and iconography, and the spread of identical and similar types in South-East Asia,I as far as the Celebes. This is discussed against a background of Roman and prehistoric Egyptian evidence, and the data gathered from stratified excavations during the last ten years in India2. M. A. Murray,3 while writing on "Female Fertility Figures" classified them into three groups as follows: (I) The Universal Mother or Isis type (2) The Divine Woman or Ishtar type (3) The Personified Yoni or Baubo type. Briefly the characteristics of each are as follows:- The Universal Mother This is the true "mother" goddess represented in three ways: - (a) With full breasts, often exaggerated in size or number. (b) With a child in her arms, either being suckled or held up to her face. (c) As a pregnant woman. In these figures the child is an essential part, actual or implied. Of these types, two are here illustrated. The first (Fig. 2) is a surface find from a Chalcolithic * The type here discussed is different from the types included by Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy in his article "Archaic Indian Terracottas," Marg, VI, 2, pp. 22-35. I I cannot adequately express my indebtedness to Dr. Carl Schuster. After I showed him the figures from Ter in Poona, on his return to the United States, he ransacked all the literature bearing on this subject in South-East Asia and beyond, photographed the relevant material from books and also requested his friends - who are also my friends now - to send me the original photographs. After waiting for nearly three years to do justice to all this material I thought it advisable to publish merely the bare facts without trying to go into greater details about the origin and spread of the motif discussed here. If the matter is inadequately treated, the fault is mine; but I remain profoundly thankful to Dr. Schuster, Prof. C. Tj.Bertling of Koninlijk Institut Voor de Tropen, Amsterdam, Dr. J.H. Jager Gerlings, Curator, for a photo of the house model in Rotterdam Museum, Van Heekeren of Java (now in Holland), Prof. Heine-Geldern (Vienna), Prof. Galestin, Amsterdam, and Prof. Franz Termer, Director of the Museum in Hamburg for kindly allowing me to publish the two photos of Dilsuki from his forthcoming (now probably published) monograph, Dr. Roland W. Force, Curator of Oceanic Archaeology and Ethnography, Chicago Natural History Museum, for photocopy of the "shameless woman" on the gables of the houses in Palau. 2 For reproducing photographs from these, I am obliged to Shri A.

Both the figures in essence belong to the same type in which the buttocks are exaggerated, and little or no attention is paid to the delineation of other features: head, nose, arms and even breasts. The antiquity of the Bilwali type can be traced back to Neolithic Anatolia and Crete,4 that of the Nevasa one to Upper Palaeolithic Europe.5 This would be "the archaic style" figurine of Gordon,6 though those illustrated by him are a little elaborate. So also are the "Mother God- dess" type from Ahichchhatra,7 Kausambi,8 Sonepurs and Somnath.9 The Divine Woman In the second type,"the figure is always that of a young woman, hardly more than a girl, and the rounded limbs are made as beautiful as the skill of the sculptor permits." She is some- times nude, sometimes lightly clad and sometimes completely clothed. "Such figures," as Murray has rightly remarked, "should not be called a 'mother goddess,' for she has not yet borne a child." It represents "the divine woman whom man desires - beautiful, exquisite, allur- ing, potential mother but still a virgin." Personified Yoni or Baubo In the third type, as Murray showed by discussing examples from Neolithic Egypt as well as much later figures from the same country, and also from England and Ireland, the whole emphasis is laid on the pudenda. And "in the ancient world, the most realistic of such figures belong to Egypt, where they represent the goddess Baubo. Though these figures are of the Roman period, they are not necessarily of Roman origin, they are merely an ancient goddess in a new form." "The figure is commonly represented as seated on the ground, the legs spread out so as to display the pudenda, which are strongly marked and often exaggerated in size." In some cases the figure is squatting with the knees raised and turned outward. This Murray calls the Baubo-Phryne or "frog" attitude. "In every case the outward spread of the thighs is essential. The pose of the arms is varied; sometimes they are raised in the so-called 'attitude of prayer,' sometimes they are held forward as in invitation, sometimes the hands are laid on the thighs to stretch the legs apart and so emphasize the pudenda. This last was not uncommon in late Roman times." 4 See Evans, The Palace of Minos at Knossos, I, figs.

II2</page><page sequence="3">Codrington followed up this publication with an article "Iconography: Classical and In- dian,"Io in which he cited a small female terracotta figure in the form of a toad, now in the Indian Museum, London. Though its exact provenance and date were not known, from other associated red stone figures and stylistic evidence, he assigned it to Mathura in the Kushan period (early second century A.D.). He also thought that similar naked goddesses or Yakshinis from Bharhut, Mathura, Sanchi etc. belonged to the Baubo and the Sheila-na-gig class, and the small toad figure, specially inspired by the Baubo figures. This inspiration, he attributed to the increased overland contacts with Western Asia during this period. Codrington probably suspected Roman influence in the handing down of this inspiration, when he used the words "the provincial Roman art of Sirkap, the Taxila of the first century B. C. must be taken into consideration as the witness of special contacts." Excavation during the last ten years has conclusively shown that the first two centuries of the Christian era and probably the first century B. C. witnessed a prosperous maritime as well as overland trade with the Roman world. This was not confined to Taxila or Mathura, as the principal seats of Kushan power, but was felt all over India, and more by the sea-ports on the western and eastern coast of India. This is exemplified, besides Roman coins, by amphora sherds from Arikamedu, Chandravalli, Kolhapur, Nevasa, Junnar and Ujjain. Associated with this is a fine Red Polished ware, some of it, as at Nasik and probably at Nevasa, and other Andhra sites, being of Roman origin or done in imitation of the Roman ware. It was with such sherds that the principal figure (Fig. 3) discussed here was brought from Ter, Osmanabad District, Bombay (now Maharashtra) State. Ter is the ancient Tagara. It lay on the trade route from Masulipatam in the east coast to Junnar or Broach in the west via Paithan. Until recently it was known chiefly for its early structural Chaitya-like temple."I Extensive mounds at the sites were noted by Cousens in his short visit,lz but their age was never suspected. Recently, a number of finds from Ter were brought to my notice. Among these, I found the famous Black-and-Red pottery, the Red Polished ware, beautiful kaoline boy- heads, the terracotta goddesses and a feeding cup, also in fine Red Polished ware. Though not stratified, there is no doubt, from the evidence afforded by Nevasa, Kolhapur and Maheshwar and the unstratified evidence from Kondapur, that we can confidently assign all the objects to the first-second century A. D. In fact small excavations13 there during 1958 have confirmed this inference, and a figure (Fig. 4) like the one discussed here was found in the excavation, in as- sociation with Red Polished ware etc. and assigned to the Ist-3rd century A.D. Of these, I would like to discuss in some detail the terracotta female figure (Fig. 3). It measures about i 1/2 inch to 2 12 inch, about 1/ inch thick, and is cast in a single mould, the back side being flat. The surface is fine, red polished all over. The female is shown seated as described by Murray, with the thighs spread out. The arms are supposed to be on the sides. But there is no head. This is intentional. Round the neck is a beaded necklace, a thick girdle encircles the waist, and there are heavy anklets. In the stratified figure (Fig. 4) there seem to be a large number of 10 Man, XXXV, I935, No. 70, p. 65. " Cousens, ASIAR., 1902-03, p. I96. I2 Op.cit. 13 See I. A. R.

An almost identical figure (Fig. 5) on a circular terracotta plaque was found by Marshall in his excavations at Bhita.14 It is now exhibited in the Indian Museum at Calcutta. Though headless like the Ter figure, it differs in having a lotus flower with petals falling over the shoulders, while the hands are upraised like those of a toad; the waist is very narrow and deco- rated by a girdle, and on the legs are worn a heavy anklet and a series of rings, and bangles on the arms. This figure, though heavily ornamented, is nearer the Baubo type than are those from Ter. Marshall, probably because of the association, assigned it to the Kushan period, but thought that it might be Gupta. He further drew attention to a similar figure from Kosam exhibited in the Indian Museum. The former really is of the Kushan period, as it was found just after (if the numbers in dark black were given on the field or indicate the order in which the objects were discovered) what Marshall called a "water bottle."I5 Since the Kolhapur finds6 this has been recognized as a characteristic vessel in Red Polished Ware and dated to the znd century A.D. Similar figures are also found sculptured in caves and temples. The first (Fig. 6) is from a cave at Siddan Kotte, north of Kelur in Northern Karnatak. This was copied by the late Mr. Chapgar and is reproduced from his diary. The figure of a goddess (Fig. 7) with a female attendant on either side in Cave No. 21 (Rameshwar) at Ellora seems similar, but may be in fact different. The goddess is seated in utkatikdsana with thighs spread apart, prominently showing the pudenda region. But the latter appears to be repaired, as are some other portions of the sculpure, and it is not certain whether the figure was originally nude. If it indeed was, then one might say that this type of mother goddess was accepted into the Rashtrakuta pantheon. She was in fact turned into a regular goddess, as shown by the attendant figures. Were some doubt left about such a development, it is removed by a tiny but highly signi- ficant stone sculpture (Fig. 8) from Vadgaon, near Satara. It was brought to me by Shri Inamdar of the Aundh State Museum. The goddess, again headless, is shown exactly as in the two terracottas discussed above, but in addition with a bull - Nandi - to her right. She is regarded as a form of Durga or Parvati. That this was again a widespread feature is being proved by the occurrence of an almost identical figure from the excavations at Nevasa, in I959-1960. The stone figure (Fig. 9) was found from the foundation debris of Period VI and is thus assignable to Period V (c. 100-300 A.D.). This goddess was even accepted in the early Buddhist pantheon, as is shown by a terracotta from Nagarjunikonda. In this, the upper part of the goddess is in the form of a stupa (Fig. 0o). Baubo's Indianization is thus complete. Stella Kramrisch has identified a similar figure - a stone sculpture - in the museum at I4 Arch.Soc.ofIndia, Ann. Rep. (ASIAR), 19II-I2, p. 75, pl. XXIII, no. 40. A figure similar to this is described and illustrated by Kala as from Kausambi, though the latter is not clear. See Kala, op.cit., p. 30, figs. pl. XVII, A and C.

But before accepting this interpretation, it should be pointed out that we have no early identical figures from the Rigvedic period (whatever be the date of that period) or from a period before the first-second century A.D. The Alampur and other figures are at least five or six centuries later than the first introduction of this figure in India. So the identification of the figure with Aditi-Uttanapad may be justified as a later apotheosis of an idea or symbolism which was probably foreign, as pointed out here. How this gradually took place has been shown. And it must be emphasised once again that it was not only in the Brahmanic religion, but also in the Buddhist that this symbol was deified. An explanation of the survival (if not the first introduction) of such a goddess in India was provided by the late Shri Chapgar. He has noted that the figure is called "Lajja Gauri" i.e. "a shy woman." But this is euphemistic. Really it means "a shameless woman." Hence her head is never shown. Now-a-days, women who do not get children worship "Lajja Gauri." Butter and red lead are applied on the vagina and breasts and they pray for children. This explains one of the reasons why such figures occur not only in Indian art and icono- graphy, but in European, West Asiatic, Egyptian and even South-East Asian monuments. There might be psychological reasons too, as pointed out by Murray, and that is how such figures could find a place even on Christian churches and in Indian temples. It is interesting to find that such figures (Figs. II-I6) but with heads continue to be made even now, or were made until recently in such far of places as Kampong and Sanga, Middle and West Celebes, and Palau and Java from where figures were carried to Japan, as drawings, photographs and information kindly supplied to me by Dr. Carl SchusterI8 and his friends prove. In India, the inspiration was most probably received from Egypt through the Romans in about the first-second century A.D. It is to this that may be attributed the occurrence, in late Andhra or Satavahana layers, of another goddess, seated in European style. Cast in double mould, and perhaps nude or in diaphanous dress, she has pleasing, benign features. She might well be the "Divine Woman" or "the Ishtar type,",9 wherein the figure is always that of a young woman, hardly more than a girl, and the rounded limbs are beautifully shown. So far such "Divine Woman" figures have come from Kolhapur (Fig. 17), Nasik, Nevasa, Ter (Fig. i 8), Tripuri,20 and Nagarjunikonda,20 all belonging to the first-second century A.D. Mother goddess figures probably of similar inspiration can be had from Mathura and else- where. Hariti and Ambika are well-known. But towards the later Andhra or early Gupta period, i.e. about 300-500 A.D. and later, deterioration in type had developed as shown by the strati- graphical evidence from Kolhapur,21 Nevasa,22 Maheshwar23 and Ahichchhatra24 and Kausambi.24 17 Stella Kramrisch, "An Image of Aditi-Uttanapad", Artibus Asiae, Vol. XIX, p. 259. Cf., however, Coomaraswamy, op. cit., p. 32 who says, "we cannot with any security attach a name to the Indian nude goddess," and suggests several alternations.

The woman is shown standing, with her right arm at her side, and with the left supporting a child. Agrawala called such figures ankadhdtri. On the contrary, Northern Gujarat, including the former Idar State,25 has given us some of the finest mother-and-child stone sculptures in Indian art. From this rapid review of certain types of female figures can we say definitely that these were introduced from Western Asia in the early Roman period? Except for the Piprawa (Lauriya Nadangadh) gold leaf image,26 and now the Rupar stone relief7 (600-200 B. C.), we have few well-documented figures of this nature from the Early Historical Period. It is a far cry to Mohenjodaro and the so-called Mother Goddess figures of that civilization are differently made, though the motive or purposes might be the same. As against this, there is good stratigraphical, evidence from a number of sites in India to suggest the importation of the type during the first centuries B.C. or A.D. with the Roman and West Asiatic trade. However, as with Graeco- Iranian and other motifs, the figures were soon Indianized, so much so that in figures from Gujarat, it would be difficult to see even a trace of foreign influence.28 When and how the Baubo type figures reached Indonesia (Java and the Celebes islands) is also worth investigation. The figures resemble the Mathura toad fgurine so much in certain particulars that Indian influencez9 may not be ruled out. However, allowance must be made for other sources of such influences. This might be directly Roman or early European in the I 5th- i6th century. Within India, two other sources are likely, though it is possible that both are quite inde- pendent of each other, and also of the Baubo type figure under discussion. The earlier chrono- logically3o (Fig. 19) suggesting the human sex act is a drawing on a pot found from the Chalco- lithic site of Daimabad on the Pravara river, District Ahmadnagar, in I959. Almost identical male and female symbols are carved on a pillar of a dormitory at Raisu by the Bhuiya and Muria Gonds31 (Fig. 20). So it may be argued either that the Murias carry on the prehistoric tradition, or that they have borrowed the symbolism from the figurines of the Early Historical period;32 or that the figurines themselves are based on this old tradition and have nothing to do with the Egyptian, Roman and the Western Asiatic influences. Perhaps the earliest representation of this goddess in Iran is to be found on a votive bronze "pin" from Luristan. On one piece illustrated by Ghirshman, Iran, page I02, P1. 8 a, this goddess is shown squatting in child-birth. She holds her breasts - a gesture which is shown on other 25 Shah, U.P., Sculptures from Sdmaldji and Roda, Museum and Picture Gallery, Baroda, 1960, figs. 29, 31, 37, 39, 40. 26 Bloch, T., "Excavations at Lauriya," ASIAR, I906-07, and Coomaraswamy, op.cit., p. 31, no. 36. 27 Sharma, Y.B., ". . .

It is said that thousands of figurines of similar nature are found in Near Eastern sites (Western Asia), particularly at Susa, where under the Elamite name of Kiririsha this fertility goddess was worshipped through the centuries. Under the name of Nanaia her cult continued down to the Parthian period and many terracotta figurines are found in the Parthian cemetery at this important site. It is in this way that we are able to get a link between Egypt and India in about the 7th-8th century B.C. As mentioned in the article, the goddess was taken to India under the Roman impact. 123</page></plain_text>
