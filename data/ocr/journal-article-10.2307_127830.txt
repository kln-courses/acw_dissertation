<plain_text><page sequence="1">So'viet Sociology of Religion: An Appraisal By WILLIAM C. FLETCHER* Soviet sociology of religion is one of the most dynamic sectors in recent anti-religious activity. Initiated by Nikita Khrushchev's de- mand for increased scholarship on religion and atheism in 1954,1 sociology of religion made its belated entry into the panoply of Soviet scholarship in the late 1950s. With the resumption of full-scale anti- religious effort, it became an indispensable part of the anti-religious campaign of the 1960s.2 After the fall of Khrushchev in 1964, this discipline received even more emphasis, and in the past decade it has been one of the most vigorous fields of Soviet anti-religious schol- arship, eclipsing many of the long established disciplines such as origins of religion, history of atheism, comparative religions, and the like. This article will survey the various approaches and directions of the growing discipline and will suggest some of the considerations which should enter into its evaluation. Certain caveats should be mentioned at the outset, problems which permeate the field of Soviet sociology of religion and often threaten to vitiate it entirely. The most debilitating problem is the utilitarian bias of the researchers.3 Studies are not undertaken with intellectual curiosity or a detached quest for objective knowledge as their pri- mary goal; rather, they are an integral part of the anti-religious aspi- ration conditioned by the ideology. The primary function of these studies is to supply knowledge which can be used to overcome reli- * Research for this article was supported in part by a grant from the General Research Fund, University of Kansas. 1 Pravda, 11 November 1954. 2 See D.

The result is inevitably a distorted picture, in which only a part of the spectrum of possible information is presented. While the parameters which are included may perhaps provide a sufficient basis for devising engines for the destruction of religion, they are not sufficient for deriving a comprehensive, objective understanding of religion in the USSR. It is nevertheless interesting to observe the directions of this research and to examine some of its results. A second major problem of Soviet sociology of religion is the lack of capable, well qualified scholars. Over the years it has been exceed- ingly difficult to attract first-rate minds to atheism as a research field for very long. It does not enjoy highest priority in Soviet academic sociology,5 and the able, ambitious student tends to gravitate to other fields. Moreover, zealots and propagandists are often attracted to Soviet religious studies. This weakens the efforts of the more serious scholars. The findings which are presented in the following pages must be tempered by these caveats. Although considerable efforts are devoted to elaborating upon theoretical aspects of sociology,6 relatively little of what has been developed in these theoretical studies is of interest to any but the specialized Marxist. The reason, of course, is that Marxism itself is a sociological theory, and the Soviet sociologist is usually reduced to finding ways to restate the received philosophy. Thus the theoret- ical aspects of the burgeoning new discipline are of relatively slight interest to the non-Marxist, the actual conduct of research, however, generally referred to as "concrete sociological research on religion," is of great interest. With a few relatively minor exceptions, "concrete sociological re- search on religion" consists of field studies. While the collection of 4 D. M.

Previously, the study of religion had been particularly susceptible to Stalin's neo-medieval scholasticism, and figures were regularly modified to suit the theory rather than the other way around. The collection of concrete data on religion, even if unresolved problems in technique and methodology remain (and they are many, as will become evident), offers new insight into the contemporary sit- uation of religion in the USSR. A number of techniques are used in these field studies. Direct observation represents one of the most fundamental methods of re- search and can provide certain kinds of information.7 Documentary research represents a large area with many fruitful possibilities. The local press can be consulted (although care must be exercised, in view of the prevailing standards of local journalism).8 Documentary ma- terials from religious believers themselves are often highly inform- ative: Among research materials are compositions of a theological character, documents of religious polemics, religious belles lettres, poems, song, and tracts. As a rule these are handwritten and typed compositions, less frequently compositions printed on duplicating apparatuses, and even more rarely printed by typograhic means.9 Finally, where the cooperation of local authorities is secured, some studies have been able to use absolutely secret materials from police archives-interrogation reports, confessions, court transcripts, ma- terial evidence, and the like.'0 Soviet scholars can occasionally acquire data from direct observa- tion of sermons and liturgical activities. One of the most attractive features of this approach is that Soviet scholars can use it on a cost- 7A. I.

This method was selected in particular for the study of attendance and liturgical practice and its influence on parishioners of three Orthodox churches of Lenin Oblast, Moscow. The investigators attended all divine services during the course of the entire period of the investigation. The investigation was devoted to determining the number of parishioners (among them, separately, men, women, children, adolescents, youth, people of middle age, and people over fifty), the forms of liturgical ac- tivity (worshiping icons, bowing, participating in general singing, lighting candles, etc.), the participation of various groups of parishion- ers in liturgical activities, elements of divine service (collective prayers, reading the Bible, giving the sacraments, preaching, etc.), the composi- tion and form of religious propaganda, and the influence of the divine service on its participants." Discussions with individual respondents, by way of contrast, repre- sents the most costly form of research in terms of man-hours. These discussions, informal as a rule, often last for hours.'2 In several projects, for example, recourse was made to the non-standardized, open interview. Although the researcher was also armed with a grid of basic questions, he was able to raise them in any order, in -order to change the formula, and even to raise unforseen questions which were dictated by the situation. The record of the results in this case took the form of a free conversa- tion. The quality of materials acquired was high, but statistical rework- ing of them was difficult.'3 The questionnaire serves as the basic tool for contemporary studies. Other approaches are used for verification and illustration of this pri- mary approach. Soviet researchers are well aware of the difficulty 11I. N.

One study of school children in Kazakhstan varied the question- naires according to the religious background of the students. The form for Russian schools included the following question: 'Explain the words: 'cosmonaut', 'god',* heaven' 'hell'. What is the Bible and have you seen it? Which holidays do you like most of all and why? Do you pray? Do you believe in god? Who tells you about god?" The form for the Kazakh school . . . included such questions as: "Explain the words: 'cosmonaut', 'god', 'heaven', 'hell. What is the Koran? Have you seen it? What are the Uraza and Ait, and do you observe them in your home? Do you believe in god? Who tells you about god?"'8 Soviet scholars have been able to ask a broad array of questions. 1. What circumstances of life brought you to faith? 2. What does religion give you? 3. In your opinion, how did the stars, the sun, the earth, and man, originate? 4. How can one (in your opinion) prove the existence of god? 5. What phenomenon in your opinion best illustrates religion? 6. Do you read the Bible, and what passages most often? 7.

These findings include demographic infor- mation and data on religious beliefs and practices. The first problem, which is really prerequisite to all others, is to define the religious person. Most Soviet researchers make their defi- nition in terms of belief in God.20 While there are Soviet researchers who attempt a more sophisticated analysis,2' all too many take an exceedingly simplistic approach: "All possible nuances and variants of answers come down to three basics: Yes, I believe; No, I do not believe; I do not know, I find it difficult to answer that question."22 They then divide the population using their definition of religiousness into categories consisting of believers, those who waver between re- ligious belief and unbelief, and non-believers. Soviet researchers attempt to derive statistics concerning the inci- dence of religion in the population. The reported percentages vary widely, ranging in some studies well below 10 percent; on closer inspection these low findings generally prove to be the result of ad- vance selection of the population studied, such as university students, among whom religious incidence is very low.23 The majority of the studies find that between 15 percent and 35 percent of the population are religious.24 There are some studies, however that find an even 19 D.

The extreme finds congregations with 90 percent to 100 percent of the members over age 60.26 The bulk of the studies find that 60 percent to 85 percent are elderly.27 Some studies, however, have found relatively young congregations, particularly among Prot- estants and other sectarian groups.28 Women tend to predominate, typically constituting 75-90 per- cent of a congregation.29 Religious groups with more men than women are wildly atypical, but there have been studies which found a ratio of women to men lower than that of the general population.30 Religious people tend towards the lower levels of education and occupation.3' There are exceptions, of course, with more occurring in occupation than in educational level.32 Soviet scholars have not yet examined the extent to which official policies and sanctions against religious students and workers are responsible for this tendency for religious people to congregate at the lower ends of the spectra.

Certain types of dwellings can be correlated to the incidence of religious believers (e.g., fewer believers in womens dormitories, more in sub- urbs where private homes predominate),35 but the percentage of the population which is religious remains fairly constant when floor space per person is examined as the independent variable.36 Surprisingly, income level does not seem to vary significantly between believers and non-believers,37 perhaps because religious believers who in their lower occupational levels receive less pay, have a greater tendency to seek overtime work.38 In their recreational habits they tend to make less use of the mass- communications media and of belles lettres.39 Religious people tend to avoid civic activity40 and generally fulfill such social obligations only when it is unavoidable.41 Many religious people try to avoid contact with citizens who are not fellow believers.42 33 Duluman, et al., Sovremennyi, pp. 32-33; Galitskaia, "K voprosu," p. 394; Andri- anov, "Evoliutsiia," p. 171. 34V.

One survey discovered that 97.7 per- cent of the believers acquired their religious belief in the family.48 Another study found that in approximately 25 percent of the families of believers religion influences the children,49 but a figure this low is open to question. Religious education has been a point of much con- tention in the contemporary anti-religious campaign, and it seems likely that many of the religious people might find it prudent to be less than candid when this matter is raised. Conflicting data result when Soviet researchers inquire about hap- piness and the belief in an afterlife. "Of 1,645 believers surveyed by us, only 30 percent connected their answer to the question about the meaning of life with 'blessedness in the after life'."50 According to another study only 6.3 percent of the Orthodox would agree, while 62.2 percent of the Baptists support this religious understanding of happiness.51 "It is typical that more than one-fourth (25.7 percent) of the believers questioned consider that happiness is possible only be- 43 Klibanov, Religioznoe, pp. 99-100. 44 Ibid., p. 78. 45 Ignatenko and Prokoshina, "Opyt," p. 242.

The reason for satisfaction was for the overwhelming majority religious. 82.1 percent connected their satisfaction with assurance of personal salvation.53 With regard to theology, Soviet researchers find that the level of theological sophistication is comparatively low among Soviet believ- ers. According to one study, only 11.8 percent of the Orthodox believe in an abstract God.54 In two other studies, 2,831 of 14,654 believers, or 19.3 percent, had an anthropomorphic concept of God.55 The results of the church being far away and the lack in fact of an Orthodox influence or of a Christian ideology in general are as follows: the absolute majority of the believers do not read the Bible and do not know its content or the basic positions of the Christian faith.... All this raises the supposition that in fact what is disseminated in these towns is not so much Orthodox Christianity as a synthesis of several aspects of the Christian religion with survivals of the ancient pagan faith in the guise bf superstition.5 Even such fundamental doctrines as belief in an afterlife seem to have weakned, as has been noted abovePT The connection between religion and morality remains strong among believers, with the majority of them asserting that religion enhances the moral level of society.58 One Soviet researcher states: Unfortunately, the majority of believers (including "traditional be- lievers") uncritically accept preaching that religion supports good morals, that faith and "the fear of god" preserve one from wickedness. As a rule, in answers believers repeat the theological assertion that re- ligion teaches the good, that it defends good morals, that from it people 52 Pismanik, "Religioznaia," p. 150. 53 Ignatenko and Prokoshina, "Opyt,"&gt; pp. 255-56. 54 Duluman, et al., Sovremennyi, p. 132. 55 Tepliakov, Problemy, p. 141; Onishchenko, "Tendentsii," p. 93. 56 Z.

In some rural areas, 90 percent and more of the homes have icons.6' Frequency of church attendance is low among believers, probably due to the small number of churches remaining. In most cases it would appear that the average religious believers attend church very infre- quently-four times a year or less.62 Nevertheless, some studies show interesting exceptions: in one town 47 percent of the believers at- tended church at least once a year, even though the nearest church was twenty-five kilometers distant.63 One study discovered that 72 percent of the urban believers in Voronezh attend Orthodox churches more or less regularly,64 and in another study only 22 percent had not attended church during the preceding year.65 "It is calculated that of every 100 religious people in Voronezh oblast, 75 more or less syste- matically attend church and prayer meetings." The major religious holidays, incidentally, seem to have retained their attractiveness for a large segment of the population.67 As for baptism, it appears that this rite remains popular, even though Soviet sociologists have not as yet presented data which would permit an estimate of the overall percentage of Russian children who are baptized. A survey of Komsomol upper classmen from throughout the USSR indicated that at least 51.7 percent of those from historically Christian nationalities had been baptized.68 The Voronezh study re- vealed that virtually all of the religious citizens surveyed had their 59 Pismanik, "Religioznaia," p. 150. 60 Iablokov, "Transformatsiia," p. 129. 61 Alekseev, "Metodika," p. 146; Kolbanovskii, Kollektiv, p. 244. 62 Ul'ianov, "Opyt," p. 224. 63 Gaidurova, "Zavisimost'," p. 31. 64 Tepliakov, Problemy, p. 85. 65 L.

It turns out that until age three grandmothers willingly baby-sit their unbaptized grandchildren and then they refuse, but such a conclusion would not sound very convincing. Another explanation is more likely. The fact, evidently, is that for the first three years religious relatives manage to "work over" individual nonbelieving parents, convincing them of the necessity to baptize the child.72 The religious wedding rite has not, apparently, survived so well. Religious weddings are still performed, but only a very small per- centage of all marriage ceremonies are religious.7 Of all religious ceremonies, the funeral rite remains the most widely observed. Again, nationwide data are not available, but in a number of places 80-90 percent of the funerals are still religious.7 In Voro- nezh on Easter Sundays, from 90,000 to 150,000 people have been observed visiting the church cemeteries.75 In summary, Soviet sociologists are very concerned about the per* sistence of religious rites in the country. It is recognized that these ceremonies, even when unbelievers participate in them, can serve to attract people to religion.76 And although not many might agree, some would go so far as to equate rejection of the civil ceremonies, which have been created to replace the religious rites, with a citizen's lov- alty: "Their rejection suggests a rejection, at the deepest personal level, of the Soviet system of belief, feeling and action.

Unfortunately, however, very little of the potential has been realized, due to serious weaknesses in the research. At every stage of the research there are many problems which have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. During planning and application many mistakes are made; in the processing, analysis, and interpretation other mistakes appear; and finally, new problems are introduced in the final presentation of the data. One of the initial problems is the selection of the subjects for field research. Often by chance, but in some cases apparently by design, populations are chosen for the research which tend to bias the data in one direction or another. For example, data on church attendance gathered in towns where all churches have been closed and the nearest church is some miles away can scarcely be represen- tative.78 Study of Christian practices in a predominantly Moslem area will also yield atypical results.79 Even with an eminently sound research plan, the desire for objec- tivity may be frustrated. For example, One must bear in mind one more danger to the acquisition of objective data by the questionnaire method: the administrators and teachers of individual schools, from falsely understood consideration of prestige, have tried to exert pressure on the pupils and have conducted belated educational work immediately before the survey.80 In devising the questionnaire, many errors can be introduced. Western sociology has been quick to recognize the danger, seldom detected by Soviet scholars, that official ideological preconceptions may prejudice the approach.8' As a result, questions may be poorly phrased and misleading. The most common problem, however, is the researcher himself influencing the response. According to a Soviet scholar, It is especially important to take into account the danger of subjectivism. What is stated in the questionnaire is not fact but only expression-not always clear, occasionally incompetent, and sometimes even insincere. Furthermore, the determination of expressions (for example, in an inter- 78 Gaidurova, 'Zavisimost'," p. 31; Kolbanovskii, Kollektiv, p. 236. 79 Cherniak, Formirovanie, passim. 80 Alekseev, "Metodika," p. 145. 81 P. Hollander, "The Dilemmas of Soviet Sociology," in Simirenko, Soviet, p. 308.</page><page sequence="14">186 The Russian Review view), and especially their interpretation, in greater or lesser degree are "colored" by the researchers themselves. All of this "contaminates" the materials gathered. Prevention and "filtration of contaminants" is by no means a simple task.82 Some errors are introduced simply through lack of adequate under- standing of the subject matter. One survey of 2,057 convinced Ortho- dox believers found that only 11 percent believed in the Trinity;83 in view of the absolute universality of this doctrine throughout Ortho- doxy's history, this result may indicate that the question was mis- leading and should have been deleted entirely. Similarly, when 129 of 538 respondents cannot answer a question, it is quite possible that something-is wrong with the question.8. The untrained interviewer is a perennial bane of sociological study. When a researcher reports with regard to one interview, "When we tried to make fun of her pride.. .," obviously his technique is ques- tionable.85 We shall give a characteristic excerpt from a conversation with the Baptist Iu. (city of Saran', Karaganda, works as a doctor). The con- versation was concerning whether the world is indeed created with goals and intelligence corresponding to a merciful and good creator. Question: And the tuberculosis bacilla-this is from a good creator? And the death of children-this is from his wisdom? And war-this is from the love of the creator towards people? Answer: The devil is responsible for this. Question: And why does the infinitely wise creator of the world per- mit this "devil" to create so much sorrow for what god has created? Answer: God gave freedom-to go towards good or to choose evil. And people themselves are guilty in their misfortunes. Question: And the little child who is ill with tuberculosis is also him- self guilty? Answer: The wisdom of god is incomprehensible to an unbeliever.86 This quotation illustrates the danger of using inexperienced people 82 M. G.

When a team includes directors of Party prop- aganda organizations, secretaries of Party committees, secondary school administrators, surgeons, and writers, it is unlikely that any brief training periods can preclude such errors as these. Equally serious is the problem of reliability of respondents. Ob- viously, the researchers carry the aura of official endorsement, and particularly when anti-religious policies and activities have created a tense situation, this can only inhibit frankness in the respondents.88 The task of maximizing the scientific value of the conversations runs into difficulties of another sort.... Let us take the following question- naire dialogue: Researcher: Tell me please, do you believe in god? Believer: Well, how to tell you? I don't know myself whether there is a god or not. Researcher: Do you attend church? Believer: When do we have time to go to church? Researcher: And why do you keep icons? Believer: The parents hung them way back when. Rather than leave the corner empty, let them sparkle there. "Waverer" decides the researcher. It is evident that the person is wavering, but the important thing consists of explaining whether he wavers in his own faith or is shy about speaking to an outsider about his most secret feelings.89 The third, and by far the most likely, alternative is that the respond- ent is consciously avoiding a direct answer. Subjects may not cooperate because they generally are indifferent, at best, to whether the research is successful: "Subjectively, the be- liever is interested in preserving the faith, and not in studying the causes of religiousness."90 The fact that when studying attitudes toward religion the researcher is 87 Tepliakov, Problemy, p. 32. Such employment of amateurs is by no means atypi- cal; cf. Tepliakov, "'Pobeda," p. 134; V. Evdokimov, "Konkretnye sotsial'nye issle- dovaniia i ateizm," Nauka i religiia, 1968, no. 1, p. 24; K. I.

They do not allow atheists who try to conduct individual work with them into the house. In the majority of the cases they interrupt the "blasphemer' with the words "None of your business! You don't believe in god, then shut up! What do you have to do with god? God himself knows what he is doing. If believers suffer misfortunes, then it is the will of god!" "I don't even want to listen! And don't talk to me, anti- Christ dwells in you!" "You don't know anything, and you are not going to prove that god doesn't exist! God is!"92 Fear of reprisal is often a factor. "Difficulties in acquiring objective data, apparently, may arise where there have been cases of violation of Soviet legislation in the field of religion on the part of boundlessly zealous partisans of liquidation of religion by administrative means."93 In one study 69.6 percent of the Baptists surveyed declared that they exercised no religious influence on their children;94 this result is so at odds with the heavy emphasis Baptists place on religious education that it quite likely reflects the extreme tensions regarding this subject (there have been many arrests and trials of Baptists guilty of teach- ing religion to minors). Among students, where expulsion from the university is common upon discovery of religious belief, fear of re- prisal can induce a religious believer to conceal his faith. One Soviet researcher directed students to classify themselves according to the categories of religious belief (believer, waverer, atheist, etc.,) and then dutifully reported that 91 percent of the atheists and 88 percent of the non-believers do not believe in God.95 Compounding the problem of fear is the sad fact that anonymity, 91 Cherniak, Formirovanie, p. 61. 92 Duluman, et al., Sovremcnnyi, p. 171. 93 Alekseev, "Metodika," p. 142. 94lgnatenko and Prokoshina, "Opyt," p. 252. 95 A.

Processing and analyzing the data introduce new problems, some of them quite serious. Most obvious is a tendency toward simplistic approaches to the data gathered. Soviet researchers often fail to ques- tion their data, taking it at face value instead.98 Often a researcher will jump to conclusions: "Today the absolute majority of workers, without doubt, accept for themselves the scientific materialist expla- nation of the world, and are in this manner opponents of religion."99 Here the researcher fails to recognize that his conclusion is'not re- quired by the data but rather rests on the ideological presupposition that religion and science are necessarily incompatible. The tendency towards a simplistic approach raises the question of whether, in fact, Soviet researchers often miss subtleties in the data. There was a case as follows. Explaining the reasons for his religiousness, one "believer" unexpectedly stated, "How should I not believe in god? For an entire year I have been going and asking for an apartment, I live with my wife and two kids in one room, no facilities whatsoever, a communal apartment. Look, let them give me an apartment-and I will renounce religion."'100 It may very well be that this is a simple case of reverse simony, as the Soviet researcher concluded. It may also be that a more subtle philosophical point was at issue here: by pointing to Marxism's in- ability to provide even the simple necessities of life, the respondent may have been impeaching the entire philosophy. The virtual absence of mathematical analysis is a serious handicap in analyzing the data. Other than use of percentages and, infre- quently, simple arithmetic manipulations, mathematical analysis is 96 Pismanik, "Metodika," p. 215; Hollander, "Dilemmas," p. 326, n. 29. 97 Saprykin, "Ateisticheskaia," p. 226; Mamaeva, "O nekotorykh," p. 85. 98 E.g., Cherniak, Formirovanie, p. 60. 99 V.

Statistical sampling techniques are seldom used,10' and other more sophisticated mathe- matical approaches are conspicuous by their absence. Simple lack of equipment is the primary cause. Computers, despite assertions to the contrary,102 are virtually unavailable. Even machine grading of questionnaires'03 is not always possible. Inasmuch as processing the questions at mechanized counting facilities is an expensive operation, it follows that one must also have in view the possibility of manual processing. Small mass questionnaires of 2-3,000 pages with a quantity of questions of about 40 can be processed by hand by a 10-man team, with intelligent planning and organization of labor, in the course of 10 days. A small questionnaire of 10-15 questions with a mass of 2-3,000 pages may be processed by the same team in 3 days.'04 One of the most severe disabilities of Soviet sociology of religion is that the data are not comparable. Nationwide statistics are not avail- able,'05 and because the field is new there is no uniformity in ap- proach. "Lack of coordination in the methodology, in the research, in the definition of criteria of religiousness and other questions makes it difficult to compare the results acquired by the various research teams."'06 This problem is compounded, of course, by the fact that on occasion researchers succumb to the propagandist's desire to select or "cook" the data for his own ends.'07 Sheer carelessness is another problem. One researcher, for exam- ple, found that only 2 percent of a formerly Sabbatarian community was religious, then noted that 94 percent of the children were circum- cised; the possibility that these two data might be contradictory did not occur to her.'08 Mistakes in arithmetic are endemic,'09 as are simple 101 V.

In many respects, the approach contains so many questionable assumptions and procedures, and is so prone to error, that one can have only a low level of confidence in its results. Many of the findings of the various -research projects, if accurate, are significant and useful; the problem is that, given the state of the art in the USSR, one cannot be sure that the findings are indeed reliable. At present, the most useful aspects of Soviet sociology of religion are not, strictly speaking, the intended results of the sociological study. In the course of their field work, Soviet researchers engage in numerous conversations with believers, gaining insights which hith- erto have been nowhere available. When illustrative quotations from believers are given to support questionnaire results, a broad window into the actual life of religious people in the USSR is opened to the oiitside observer. It is these informal pictures of contemporary Rus- sian believers which make- Soviet sociological studies among the most important if not the most important of the several approaches for the student of religion in the USSR."3 11o Ibid., p. 68. 1II Solov'ev, "0 vlIianii," p. 193. 112 Koltuniuk, "K probleme," p. 143; Duluman, et al., Sovremennyi, p. 164. 113 E.g., Nikonov, "0 nekotorykh," pp. 174-99 passim.</page></plain_text>
