<plain_text><page sequence="1">24 'THE HONEY ON THE CUP' IN OPPIAN AND OTHERS Towards the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius Oppian of Cilicia wrote a didactic epic of some 3,500 lines on sea-creatures and the methods of catching them, entitled Haliéutica . This literary, rather than scientific, enterprise was hardly an original one, for Athenaeus, whose Deipnosophistae must have been published not long after the death of Commodus in A.D. 193, tells us that he was acquainted with five such hexa- metrical Haliéuticas, those of Caecilius of Argos, Numenius of Heracleia, Pancrates of Arcadia, Poseidonius of Corinth, and lastly Oppian, whom he describes as tòv ôÂíycp irpò fiiJico v y£vó|i8vov 'Oīrmavov tòv Kíàikcc. The wider context of Oppian's work is that whole tradition in Greek of didactic epic as a merely literary exercise, which for us begins with Aratus in the early third century b.c., but which seems more precisely to have been initiated by Aratus' teacher Menecrates of Ephesus, who about 300 b.c. turned to the old Hesiodic tradition with the composition of an Erga . Aratus too was reviving an old tradition that seems to have flourished in the sixth century b.c. of versifying astronomical and meteorological lore. As is well known, his Phaenomena and also probably the Diosemeia are essentially a verse paraphrase of a treatise by Eudoxus, a treatise which already in Aratus' time did not provide the most up-to-date and reliable information. Later, whether only shortly or more than a century later, Nicander of Colophon likewise adapted, certainly in his Theriaca and perhaps also in his Alexipharmaca , the technical prose writings of a poison-expert Apollodorus. These are but two examples, and, as far as we can tell, typical ones, of what was done by a large number of poets from Aratus' time onwards for a considerable variety of poetically unpromising subjects, which, apart from astronomy, poisons and fishing, we know included astrology, medical prescriptions generally, hunting, agriculture, bee-keeping, geography, stones and the flights of birds, whilst the poetic treatment of yet other subjects, such as dicing, ball-games and swimming, is recorded by Ovid (Trist. 2. 471 if.). Later, when a particular subject had already been versified, com- position would doubtless be at least partly a matter of improving upon earlier poetic treatment. What Oppian's relation was to his predecessors in the art of versifying fish- lore we have no means of knowing. As likely as not he owed at least the broad arrange- ment of his material to an earlier Haliéutica. At least it is clear that Oppian, as we should expect, owed his knowledge very largely to book-learning. It was M. Welt- mann who in a series of articles (Herm. 23 (1888), 26 (1892), 30 (1895), 51 (1916)) first made a detailed study of the sources of Oppian as well as of the zoological writ- ings of Aelian, who flourished a generation or so after Oppian. He concluded that the principal sources for the Haliéutica were the writings of the distinguished ichthyo- logist Leonidas of Byzantium and the TTepl jcpcov of Alexander of Myndos, which was based mainly on the epitome of Aristotle's Historia Animalium made by Aristophanes of Byzantium. The dates of Leonidas and Alexander have been disputed, but R. Keydell places the former in the second century a.D., thus not far removed in time</page><page sequence="2">'the honey on the cup' in oppian and others 25 from Oppian. A number of passages in Aelian show at least the use of a common source by him and Oppian, whilst in others he was indisputably paraphrasing Oppian, a prose author paraphrasing a poet who had paraphrased a prose treatise - such were the standards of research in natural history. The facts are to be found in a convenient form in the introduction to A. F. Scholfield's Loeb edition of Aelian, On the Charac- teristics of Animals . However derivative it may be, Oppian's arrangement of his material is certainly clear and artistic. The whole is divided into five books of similar length. In Book 1, after an initial proem of 79 lines consisting of a dedication and a comparison of hunt- ing, fishing and fowling, the types of sea-creatures are enumerated (80-437) with a topographical classification into aîyiaXcbSri, ireTpaïa and irEÀáytoc, which goes back at least to Aristotle and which appears also in the fragmentary Latin Haliéutica ascribed to Ovid. The rest of Book 1 and the whole of Book 2 are taken up with the life and habits of various creatures, the murena, the dophin, the dog-fish, the tunny, the torpedo, the cuttle-fish, the ox-ray, the octopus and many others. The first 200 or so lines of Book 3 are a general description of fishing, including some twenty lines on the attributes of the fisherman. The rest of the book and the whole of Book 4 are concerned with the methods of catching particular creatures, as also is Book 5, only here the greater part of the book is taken up with first a dramatic account of a whale-hunt and then various stories about the dolphin, so that the book is something of a grand finale. We shall examine some of the means whereby the poet contrives to enliven what could have been a rather dreary catalogue. I propose first to consider the fate of Oppian's work in the hands of posterity and then to make some stylistic comments upon it in the general context of later Greek didactic epic as it has survived, before going on finally to deal all too briefly with what we may call Oppian's imaginative art. It will make for clarity if at this point I recall the chronological sequence of the extant examples of didactic epic with which we are concerned. We should of course bear in mind that this was no formal genre for the ancients, it was simply a distinctive application of eitos, indeed such an application as to disqualify it, in the eyes of some critics at least from Aristotle onwards, for designation as poetry in any serious sense of the word. From the second century b.c. onwards, however, elegiacs were also applied, if far less frequently, to this kind of material, although for Greek as opposed to Latin we have but the scantiest remains. I have already alluded to the doubt con- cerning the date of Nicander. His most recent editors, Gow and Scholfield, incline to the latest possible date around the middle of the second century b.c. The next surviv- ing poet in the tradition is almost certainly Dionysius the Periegete, whose geo- graphical poem, after much inconclusive speculation, has been firmly assigned to the early part of Hadrian's reign after the ingenious discovery of two acrostics in it, one from line 109 to line 134, which spells ETTH AIONYZIOY, and another from 5 13 to 532, which spells 0EOI EPMHI ETTI AAPIANOY. Marcellus Sidetes, who wrote some forty books of hexameters on medical matters, of which we have three fragments amount- ing to 1 01 lines, a list of fishes with medicinal properties, seems to have flourished at Rome under Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. Both Dionysius and Marcellus, then, belong</page><page sequence="3">26 A. W. JAMES to a generation immediately prior to Oppian's. Oppian's Haliéutica is dedicated to Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus together, addresses to them appearing at 1.3, 66, 77 ff., 2.41, 682 ff., and so it must have been published between 177 and 180, and probably before M. Aurelius set out on his campaign in August 178. This dating agrees with references to Oppian in Athenaeus, Eusebius and Suidas. Oppian refers to him- self as a native of Cilicia (3.7 ff., 3.205 ff.) and elsewhere his birthplace is given as either Anazarbos or Cory cos in that province. From an early date, at least from the historian Sozomen in the fifth century, until modern times another didactic epic of similar theme, the Cynegetica on beasts and hunting, was commonly attributed to the author- ship of the same Oppian. But it was J. G. Schneider who in the introduction to his first edition of the Hal . and the Cyn . in 1776, on the basis of an accurate reading of the dedications of the two poems and references in either to the homeland of its author, and also through his appreciation of the stylistic differences between them, firmly established that the dates of the poems were different and that there were two authors. A useful assemblage of both the internal and the external evidence for this distinction is to be found in the introduction of A. W. Mair's Loeb edition of the Hal . and the Cyn. The best critical summary of the evidence, however, is that of R. Keydell, the greatest living authority on this branch of literature, in R.E. xviii, i, Oppianos (1) 698-703, (2) 703-8. The Cynegetica is dedicated to Caracalla alone, at 1.3 ff., which puts it after the death of Geta in 212 and not later than 217. In view of the fact that the author refers to himself as a native of Apamea on the Orontes in Syria {Cyn. 2. 125 ff.) the most likely year of publication is 215, when Caracalla wintered at Antioch. One obvious cause of confusion is that in either poem the opening address contains the vocative 'Avrrcovïve at the end of the third line, a name shared by M. Aurelius and Caracalla. The colourful biographical details contained in the MS vitae of Oppian are of doubtful value, but if based on fact they would seem to refer at least mainly to the author of the Cyn. Keydell plausibly suggests that the early attribution of both the Hal. and the Cyn. to the author of the former could have arisen from the circulation of MSS containing a complementary trio of didactic epics, the Haliéutica, , the Cynegetica and the Ixeutica on fowling (lost already by the twelfth century; the extant prose paraphrase under the name of Dionysius may, but need not, be of the same work), in which the name of the author of the earliest and largest of the works would naturally attach itself to all three. Keydell justly remarks that we have no means of knowing whether the author of the Cyn. also really had the name Oppian. Since the name was clearly uncommon, I have decided that probability is overwhelmingly against the co- incidence, and accordingly I refer throughout simply to ' the author of the Cynegetica '. The importance of knowing certainly not only that the two poems are by different authors, but also that the Hal. was written a generation or so before the Cyn., will at once be apparent. The heavy dependence of one upon the other both in content and in language is in any case abundantly clear, and now in considering any instance of this it is possible to speak confidently of the imitation or rivalling of Oppian by the author of the Cyn. It is a pity that we cannot also settle neatly the dates of the surviving astro- logical poems. The 600 lines of the Karocpyai, times and seasons astrologically favour- able for various undertakings, which go under the name of Maximus, have been</page><page sequence="4">'the honey on the cup' in oppian and others 27 assigned to dates ranging from the Alexandrian period to the late Empire. A reduc- tion of this range to the probable would put the time of composition not earlier than the second century a.D. and before Nonnus in the fifth century. The question of the authorship and dates of the different parts of the collection of astrological poems known as the 'A-rroTeAsaucrnKa, which go under the name of Manetho, is complex. There are six Books, of which Books 2, 3 and 6 seem to be by one author, Book 4 is a separate composition, whilst the barbarous and confused Books 1 and 5 could be by one or two authors. The earliest evidence for knowledge of the collection is a refer- ence in Hephaestio at the end of the fourth century. It could very well have been the author of either or both Books 1 and 5 who assembled the collection earlier in that century. Lastly the so-called ' Orphic' Lithica , a work of 774 lines on the properties of stones, belongs certainly to the late fourth century A.D. I need hardly dwell on the enormous success enjoyed by Aratus' Phaenomena in later antiquity. Partly at least this was due to the simple fact that it conveyed in readable epic form a technical subject of wide popular appeal. Controversies raged over its factual inaccuracies and a large literature grew up around it. Poetically the achievement was modest in the extreme - a pedestrian verse-paraphrase with but meagre attempts at poetic relief apart from the famous proem, the Stoic hymn to Zeus in imitation of Cleanthes. It would seem to me the very modesty of the achievement that stimulated the successive adaptations of the work into Latin, by Varro, Cicero, Germanicus and Avienus. Nicander was responsible for a prodigious number of didactic epics, but it is small wonder that almost all of them have disappeared apart from a few fragments. So unreadable did this erudite grammarian render his works by a ubiquitous and tasteless display of lexical learning that they can have been read by none but the resolute few, and it was only the continuing interest in his glosses which ensured the survival of the Theriaca and the Alexipharmaca . His limited use as a source by Virgil in the Georgics , however, as well as the extensive use of his Theriaca by Aemilius Macer for a work in Latin of the same name, are evidence for appreciable interest in him at Rome in the Augustan era. It is worth observing that Macer was a friend of Ovid and that the latter probably made considerable use in his Metamor- phoses of a mythological epic of Nicander, the 'ETEpoiouļjevcc. With the exceptions of Dionysius the Periegete and Oppian the later examples of Greek didactic epic which I have mentioned, as well as a few other fragments, have escaped the wreck of time by the merest chance. The Manethonian collection for instance survived in a single manuscript. Dionysius and Oppian, however, are very significant exceptions. The geographical survey of the known world by the former had considerably less claim to being up to date and reliable in its own day than had Aratus' work in its. Its principal source, probably through the medium of an earlier geographical poem by Alexander of Ephesus, was Poseidonius. But it is a technically very competent and a highly readable little work, in 1 1 86 lines, with a good deal of poetic relief, and so it caught on in the schools and remained in regular use there until late in the Byzantine period. This fate is testified by its survival in more than 100 MSS and by a wealth of scholia culminating in Eustathius' great commentary written some time before 1 175. Oppian's fate was similar. At approximately the same time that the</page><page sequence="5">28 A. W. JAMES Haliéutica was being thoroughly exploited by the author of the Cynegetica Aelian was doing the same where the subject-matter of his work on natural history touched upon that of the Hal. There is evidence for knowledge of the Hal. on the part of Dionysius, author of the epic Bassarica, , and of Gregory Nazianzen, and Keydell observes ' eifrig gelesen haben sie Nonnos und Tryphiodor'. Apart from Eutecnius' prose paraphrases of the Hal. the MSS contain a very large number of scholia, which being consistently of an elementary nature are witness to the wide use of the Hal. in Byzantine times as a school-book. Explicit reference to the use of the Hal. in schools is made by an epigram in the Planudean Anthology, 4.31 1, which I render as follows: 'Oppian the tribes of the sea to pages has fixed / Making for all the young boys a limitless feast', 'Otttticcvòs ŒEÂiSeo-oïv ccÀÍTTÀoa 9OÀOC awávyaç / OfļKaro ttScti véoiç öyov direipéaiov. Elsewhere it is spoken of as a principal object of study beside Homer and Libanius. Mair in the introduction to his Loeb edition has assembled the considerable number of references to Oppian as author of the Hal., not of the Cyn., in the Geoponica , the Etymologicum Magnum and Eustathius. All this, as with Dionysius, is reflected in the great number of MSS of the Hal. that have survived, fifty-eight, thirty-eight of them being com- plete. By contrast the total given for the Cyn. by P. Boudreaux in his critical edition is seventeen. It would seem that this work owes its survival to its not infrequent associa- tion with the Hal. One sometimes finds an incomplete text of it following a complete one of the Hal. in a single codex. The conclusion of the fourth and last Book of the Cyn. is almost certainly lost. A further indication of the comparatively little use made of it in Byzantine times is the scanty collection of scholia attached to it. I cannot here trace the fate of the Hal. in modern times. Its extraordinary neglect since the end of the sixteenth century is the primary excuse for this paper. Oppian could not have been so admired for so many centuries were he not at least technically competent, and this his work is to an eminent degree. I have been a good deal occupied with the technical aspects of the Hal., but these are hardly amenable to detailed treatment here and I must content myself with a few brief comments and comparisons. In his employment of the hexameter Oppian observes with a high level of consistency the refinements established by Callimachus and cultivated by the Alexandrians, among the didactics at least by Nicander, whilst Aratus' versification had been far less refined. A. Wifstrand in his book Von Kallimachos %u Nonnos has shown how he follows the Callimachean caesura rules, the avoidance of spondaic and iambic words and of independent long monosyllables before the penthemimeral caesura. Wifstrand has occasion to compare this with the much less exacting standard of the Cyn. Here he was extending in one direction the extremely valuable work of Karl Lehrs, who in his Quaestiones Epicae (1837), dissertano V , De Halieuticorum et Cynegeticorum discre- panza, following the start made by J. G. Schneider, made the only systematic com- parison between the Hal. and the Cyn. He listed with examples the main metrical dif- ferences and then a number of lexical and syntactical ones. This excellent work remains the starting-point for all further metrical as well as some linguistic and stylistic studies of the two poems. His metrical comparisons on the whole demonstrate the superiority of the Hal. over the Cyn., for example in the much freer use of correption in the latter</page><page sequence="6">'the honey on the cup* in oppian and others 29 and the frequency there of spondaic line-endings with trisyllabic words. As might have been expected, we find that the metrical standards of Dionysius are comparable to those of Oppian. Elsewhere in late didactic epic, although I have no precise data, it seems that standards are rarely, if ever, as high. In the Manethonian corpus metre ranges from the satisfactory to the wretched. In the Orphic Lithica it is adequate, but far from the refined technique of Oppian. As regards use of the traditional epic language Aratus and Nicander had not set a happy example. Aratus made many blunders, as with his excessive and often objec- tionable use of the genitive case, the use of the dual for the plural and of adverbs as prepositions. Nicander seems to have been led astray mostly by the speculative applica- tion of his linguistic learning. The purity and correctness of the language of Diony- sius and Oppian are thus all the more praiseworthy, and it is understandable that they should have been particularly valued for this in late antiquity and Byzantine times, since it was often more for their language than anything else that ancient poets con- tinued to be read. Some of the linguistic inadequacies of the Cyn, were noted by Lehrs, for example the use of the dual for the plural and the misplacement of te, yáp, and 6é, and other, particularly flexional, inaccuracies were later noted by O. Rebmann in his dissertation (Basel, 1918) Die sprachlichen Neuerungen in den Kynegetika Oppians von Apamea, Marcellus and Maximus clearly had mastered the Homeric language, even if they do not attain to grace in its employment. The Orphic Lithica, on the other hand, is often unepic and not free from positive blunders. All who wrote in the millennium-old, artificial language of epic were necessarily learned poets, though naturally some were considerably more learned than others, and it was a principle of their art to develop the resources of this language by the applica- tion of analogy for the creation of new forms, mostly compound words, but also not a few simples. Here the example of Nicander was particularly fruitful. Fatal as was his prodigious linguistic learning, when combined with total lack of taste, to his own art, none the less his unprecedented enterprise in the application of analogy to create new forms showed others ways they could follow with greater caution. He modified the forms of old words, he made simples out of compounds and vice versa , he lengthened words by the addition of common suffixes, and he frequently altered the meanings of Homeric words in a speculative way. I have elsewhere made a detailed analysis of Oppian's activity in this field, but here I must limit myself to a few words. As regards sheer numbers of new forms his level of creativity is not outstandingly high among epic poets generally from the Alexandrian period on. It is lower than those of Calli- machus, the author of the Cynegetica and the Manethonian corpus, but on the other hand higher than those of Apollonius Rhodius, the Orphic Argonautica and Nonnus. Although Oppian learnt much from the Alexandrians and like them did not hesitate to adopt many elements from the language of other literary genres, unlike them he was not fastidious in his employment of words belonging to early epic. The Alexandrians rejected many of these on the ground that having passed into general currency they were no longer appropriate to the more refined kind of poetry. Oppian had no such scruples, and herein he was at one with most epic poets, didactic or otherwise, of the Imperial period. He also differs from at least some of the Alexandrians by his avoidance</page><page sequence="7">30 A. W. JAMES of obscure glosses; his language is generally a model of clarity. His linguistic example was undoubtedly very influential with many later epic poets, and a considerable number of his new words were used by them, among extant poets notably by the author of the Cynegetica and Nonnus. Rhetorical elements are not absent from the Haliéutica, , nor should we expect them to be. They are certainly more prominent than in Aratus, but that is not saying very much, and they are by no means obtrusive by the standards of late epic generally. It is the particular service of G. Blirner in his Schulprogramm (Bamberg, 1912), Oppian und sein Lehrgedicht vom Fischfang, , to have shown briefly the nature and extent of rhetoric in Oppian, such as his not infrequent apostrophizing of deities, rulers and animals, his fondness of litotes with negatives, and his rather more limited use of anaphora, plays on words and the like. Rhetoric in the Hal., however, pales into insignificance when compared with its role in the Cyn., where it is painfully obtrusive to a degree unparalleled elsewhere in Greek poetry, as has been shown by E. Norden ( Antike Kunstprosa, 834 if.), for in addition to a recurrent use of anaphora and isocolon there is an extraordinary amount of rhyming both at the caesura and at the line-end. Constant straining after rhetorical effect was later most notably in epic a feature of Nonnus and his followers. Rhetoric was one means at the disposal of didactic poets for enlivening their treat- ment of intrinsically rather dry material. But another and for Oppian far more important one, which was peculiarly the property of those treating zoological subjects, was anthropomorphism. As has already been indicated, much writing on zoological matters, and a fortiori any poetic writing on the same, was derivative in the extreme and could lay no claim to be of a serious scientific nature. Indeed it is clear that many writers were simply satisfying a popular demand for curiosities and wonders. A promi- nent feature of this interest was the attribution to at least the higher animals of human or quasi-human intelligence and hence the application to them of moral standards, a practice that must have been to some extent encouraged by contemporary philo- sophical speculation. Representatives of the Peripatetic- Academic tradition upheld the continuity of all living beings, and some of the Stoics, whilst they could not strictly ascribe Aoyos and -ttócOoç to other animals, none the less were much interested in the apparent rationality of some animal behaviour. The disputes to which these views gave rise found their classic expression in Plutarch's De sollertia animalium some two generations before Oppian. A symptom of these interests generally is the popularity of the fable, represented in the collection of iambic scazons by Babrius, whose date is uncertain, but who was probably not far removed in time from Oppian. It is Oppian's imaginative exploitation of an almost fable-like anthropomorphism whilst managing to avoid a serious distortion of his factual material which perhaps more than any other single feature of his writing makes him worth reading. If anyone is inclined to doubt the veracity of the latter observation, let him turn to a few articles in D'Arcy Thomp- son's Glossary of Greek Fishes, and see there the unquestionable scientific value of Oppian's statements as to the appearance and habits of fishes. W. Kroll in his article Lehrgedicht in R.E., an article which I should be the last to belittle, remarks that it was still found worthwhile to make prose paraphrases of such works as the Haliéutica ,</page><page sequence="8">'the honey on the cup* in oppian and others 31 because their epic language was a real hindrance to understanding. This would be justified with reference to such a writer as Nicander, but for Oppian it is palpably untrue: almost all his statements are crystal-clear to all except those whose knowledge of the normal epic language is defective. The reason for such prose paraphrases as Eutecnius' of the Haliéutica can only be that persistent and pathetic demand for abstracts of works of literature to which we owe our skeletal knowledge of so many lost works. In the closest possible relation to his anthropomorphism stands Oppian's remark- ably abundant use of similes. In all the rest of extant Greek didactic epic from Aratus on, with the sole exception of the Cynegetica , the use of similes is negligible. In fact the only poets apart from Oppian and the author of the Cynegetica who provide us with any, as far as I have noted, are Nicander with three in the Alexipharmaca , one of five lines (30-34), one of six lines (215-220) and one of three lines (288-290), Dionysius with two of two lines each (123-125 and 531-2) and the Orphic Lithica with just one or two. The Haliéutica has no fewer than 78 fully developed similes, and a further 47 brief comparisons. The Cynegetica has 33 full similes and 21 comparisons, which in a work three-fifths the length of the Hal . represents a considerably lower frequency. The average length of similes in the Hal . is also substantially above that in the Cyn., approx. 5 ' lines, with a maximum of 28 lines and a minimum of iļ lines, as opposed to 4' in the Cyn., with a maximum of 19 lines and a minimum of 1 line. Brief com- parisons in the Hal. seem to be generally just slightly longer than those in the Cyn., ļ line, with a maximum of iļ lines (once iļ) and a minimum of 2 words, as opposed to $ line in the Cyn., but the difference here is hardly significant. The percentage of each Book in the Hal. devoted to similes and comparisons varies considerably: 6% of Book i , 20 % of Book 2, 1 2 % of Book 3 , 20 % of Book 4, and 1 2 % of Book 5 , making an average of 14%. The percentages for the Cyn. vary less markedly: 8% of Book 1, 6% of Book 2, 5 % of Book 3, and 1 1 % of Book 4, making an average of approximately 7Ì%, or only slightly over half that for the Hal. Stated absolutely, the total number of lines devoted to similes in the Hal. is 351^ and to comparisons 33, whilst in the Cyn. the respective totals are 149 and 12 J. Everyone who has made a special study of the Hal. has expressed admiration for this aspect of the work, for this indeed shows Oppian's art at its best, and an unprejudiced reader cannot fail to warm to some of the intensely human pictures that he paints with a fine economy of words. The following elegant observations are taken from the Account of the Life and Writings of Oppian prefaced to Diaper and Jones' English-verse translation of the Hal. (Oxford, 1722). "Tis one of the most admirable secrets in poetry to heighten small things by a noble manner of expression; the meaner therefore any subject is, the more capable it is of being adorned. As there is a regular gradation of created beings from man down to the lowest vegetable, the naturalist seems to have the advantage in a subject which is capable of being improved by borrowing its metaphors and allusions from objects of a superior nature. His trees and plants are influenced with the passions of desire and aversion, joy and grief; and his animals seem to rival mankind in their virtues and per- fections. The naturalist and epic poet borrow mutually from each other; the one, in magnifying the character of his hero, finds himself obliged to fetch his comparisons</page><page sequence="9">32 A. W. JAMES from the most remarkable qualities of inferior creatures, the other, after a more easy and natural manner, adds a dignity to his subject by alluding to the hero.' It was Conrad Rittershusius in the index of his edition of 1597 who first listed the similes of the Hal . and the Cyn ., and Georg Biirner in the work already referred to made a thematic survey of the similes of the Hal . alone, to which I am here indebted. But no one, so far as I know, has hitherto taken account of the uniqueness of Oppian' s use of similes among the Greek didactics. The case of the Cyn . only underlines the exceptional nature of Oppian's achievement, because its abundance of similes is due to a close imitation of and rivalry with the Hal ., a number of them being the merest adaptations of similes in the Hal . We can, of course, never be sure that Oppian had no example to follow among the many lost didactic poets, particularly those who treated the same subject as he, but if he did, his own survival as opposed to their total loss even without memory beyond their names is itself a strong indication of the superiority of his achievement. I think it is not necessary to suppose that anything lies behind Oppian's extensive use of similes other than a turning on his part to the example of the Homeric epics and their successors. Many, though by no means all, of his similes have a still partially traceable pedigree that stems from Homer, and like all learned users of the cttoç he had studied minutely not only Homer but all the more important literary epics, as can be demonstrated on purely linguistic evidence. I was careful, however, only to say that it was not necessary to suppose any other cause for this phenomenon, as I have in mind a suggestion which is, to say the least, questionable. If we ask our- selves whether in the whole tradition of didactic epic prior to Oppian there is not any- thing comparable to the extent and quality of his use of similes, the answer is that of course in Latin there is. His exquisite and original use of similes was a prominent ingredient of what Lucretius called the honey on his cup. The hypothesis of Lucre- tian, or at least post-Lucretian Latin influence on Oppian is indeed attractive, for the latter's similes display just that combination of a re- working of traditional epic material with an application of immediately felt personal observation which could plausibly be the result of an initial inspiration from what Lucretius had done for didactic epic in Latin followed by a close study of Homeric and later, particularly Alexandrian, Greek epic similes as models. To make this possibility even a strong probability, however, it would be necessary to show indisputable reflection of Latin models in Oppian, and this I have yet to try to do. I entertain no very high hopes. The extreme difficulty of establishing knowledge and use of Latin poets by later Greek poets will be appreciated by all who are familiar with the negative conclusions as to the probability of Virgil having been used by Quintus of Smyrna and Tryphiodorus which are drawn by R. Heinze in his Virgils epische Technik and by F. Vian in his Recherches sur les Post - homérica de Quintus de Smyrně . As it is, I think it should at least be regarded as an open question. I will not attempt to give you a complete list of the themes of Oppian's similes, but simply an indication of their range and diversity. It was natural enough for a writer on sea-creatures to illuminate his subject by comparisons with land-animals, and this he does frequently. He shows a particular liking for describing combats between beasts, as between a deer and a snake, a hedgehog and a snake, jackals hunting a deer, and a bull</page><page sequence="10">'the honey on the cup* in oppian and others 33 driven mad by a gad-fly. Here the author of the Cynegetica most readily found occa- sion for imitation, sometimes adapting Oppian's simile to his own main narrative and making a simile of Oppian's point of departure in his narrative of sea-creatures. Greater charm, however, generally attaches to peaceful scenes of animal life among Oppian's similes, as of kids greeting their elders, the return of a flock to the fold, a swallow feeding its young and a tortoise turned on its back by a boy. The lion, though not absent from his similes, does not figure prominently, as it does ad nauseam in the all too Homeric Quintus. Landscapes are not neglected, as the snowy scene and the mountain torrent in winter; we may recall that the rigours of winter are made vivid in Hesiod as well as in Homeric similes. But it is in scenes from human life that Oppian's similes are most effective. Here was the perfect auxiliary for one who strove to vivify his treatment of sea-creatures by the use of anthropomorphic language. The intimate and natural association between human terms and human scenes may be exemplified in the easy transition from such military terms as orpocTÓę, Aóyoi and oríyes of fishes to the elaboration of military scenes in similes. To make but a random selection, we have descriptions of athletes contesting, woodmen at work, scenes of departure and re- union several times, the grief of parents at the funeral of their only son, the ascent of a mountain at night, the effects on young men of a maiden's beauty, children with peda- gogues on their way from school and a mother's anxiety for her daughter in childbirth. I have analysed the subject-matter of the similes in both the Hal . and the Cyn . statistically as follows. The HaL has 46 similes drawn wholly from human life, of which 10 are military, and a further 12 involve humans and other animals together, chiefly in hunting scenes, making a total of 58 wholly or partially human similes. Similes, on the other hand, involving other animals alone or inanimate objects and the elements amount to only 19, i.e. one-third of the other total. The totals for the Cyn ., however, are 20 human similes (16 wholly human, of which 6 are military, and 4 mixed) and 13 similes with other subjects, the latter total being thus approximately two- thirds of the former. The ratios between the subjects of the brief comparisons differ even more sharply in the two poems. The HaL has 33 drawn from human life or involving human artefacts, and 12 with just other animals or the elements, making a ratio almost identical with that of the similes. The Cyn., however, has 1 1 comparisons from human life and 9 others. In conclusion I will try to leave you with a vivid impression of Oppian's art in his similes by giving you three examples, rather different from each other. The transla- tions of Oppian's words, except where otherwise stated, are those of A. W. Mair. In Book i of the HaL , after a description of the swarming of fishes and their journey to the Euxine for spawning (614-19), we are given a simile of the flight of the cranes (620-5). The parallel is not precise, since the cranes are said to be flying away from the snows of Mt Atlas, whereas it would have been easy enough for the poet to stress the fact of their seeking a more favourable climate, as is the case with the fish heading for the Euxine. Perhaps Oppian was conscious of this when in line 616 he added a men- tion of their return from the Euxine, Kai a5 naÂivóaTiiioç óp|if|, which looks forward to his description a little later, lines 630 following, of their retreat from the wintry storms of the Euxine. However, the real point of the comparison is simply the size of 3 cps</page><page sequence="11">34 A. W. JAMES the flock of cranes and of the shoals of fish filling respectively the air and the sea. In this simile Oppian certainly had Iliad 3.1-7 in mind. There the points of the comparison are the noise of the Trojans (KÀayyrj line 2) and that of the cranes (KÂayyf| line 3 and -T) line 5), and also the cranes' hostility to the pygmies compared with that of the approaching armies. As regards the latter point the contrast with Oppian is striking, for he makes the cranes escape the pygmies (623), as well as 'winter and the snowy Mount of Atlas', "Atâocvtoç vicpóevToc iráyov Kai q&gt;vyovaai, which is in fact the counterpart of Homer's y^cova &lt;púyov Kai áôéoxpcrrov oiißpov. This he has had logically to do after naming Ethiopia and the Nile as the region of their departure, thereby referring to the northward flight in March, not the southward flight in October, the one in Homer, a fact noted by Mair. From general observation of the way Oppian adapts and pointedly alters elements from Homer I cannot believe that the change here is merely careless or accidental. A significant verbal point is that Oppian's epithet for the cranes, T|Epó&lt;pcovos, which in Homer occurs just once applied to KiļpUKES (II. 1 8. 505), replaces the simple Tjépios in the Homeric simile. Oppian's TTuyiiaicov t' ôÀiyo6pavécov aļjevTļva yéveOÀa, 'the weak race of the feeble pygmies' (623), might at first appear to be simply intended to recall Homer's famous vekúcov á|j£vr|vccKápr|va (Od. 10.521, etc.), and indeed that its origin is partly there can hardly be denied. But a considerably closer precedent is to be found in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter at line 352, &lt;pOA' à|i6vrjvà yocpaiyevecov ávOpcomov, 'the weakly tribes of earthborn men', though most striking of all is the discovery of anevrļvos applied to TTuynaïoi in a Hesiodic Oxyrhyn- chus fragment (1358.18). This is one of many instances that demonstrate Oppian's wide and minute acquaintance with early Greek epic as well as his great ability to assimilate its resources with seeming ease and naturalness into his own creations. In Book 2 lines 253-421 constitute what we might call Oppian's great battle-piece, for here he exercises to the full his dramatic and descriptive powers and employs a remarkable concentration of fully developed similes to make impressive the deadly mutual enmity of the murena, the crayfish (Kdpaßos) and the octopus. Part-way through this episode the murena, when provoked by the crayfish, rushes at it in blind fury only to be inescapably caught in its long claws. Thus also, we are told in a simile (lines 350-6), a leopard when provoked in the amphitheatre by a huntsman impales its jaws on the point of his spear: 'As when a man skilled in the work of slaying wild beasts, when the people are gathered in the house-encircled market-place (Aacbv ánçiSónoiaiv èvaypojjiévcov àyoprjai), awaits the leopard maddened by the cracking of the whip and with long-edged spear stands athwart her path ; she, though she beholds the edge of sharp iron, mantles in swelling fury and receives in her throat, as it were in a spear-stand, the brazen lance (ev 5' cepa Aaijjićp / iļUTE SoupoSÓKí] 'cxkKī]Karīov EorraaEV aìxnf|v); even so wrath slays the unhappy murena in her folly, overcome by self- dealt wounds.' For some reason this simile is not noted by Biirner. I have not been able to ascertain whether the amphitheatre figures anywhere in Greek poetry before Oppian. It could hardly have occurred more than about two centuries before his time, and the chances against its having been employed during that period in a Greek poem of epic form are, I would suggest, rather strong. The earliest occurrence of the adjective dcjJupiOéoTpos is in Dionysius of Halicarnassus (3.68, 4.44), and the earliest of the noun</page><page sequence="12">'the honey on the cup' in oppian and others 35 àiicpiOéoTpov in Strabo (14. 1.43). The possibility must therefore be seriously con- sidered whether we have here the most indisputable example of Oppian applying independent personal observation to the embellishment of his work. Even if we sup- pose him not to have travelled outside the countries surrounding the E. Mediter- ranean, he would have had opportunity enough at that time of witnessing just such a wild-beast show in the amphitheatre of one of the great cities. L. Friedländer ( Darstel- lungen aus der Sittengeschichte Roms , 7th ed., appendix 36) records that there was one at Alexandria as early as 24 b.c., mentioned by Strabo (17, p. 795), in whom is also found reference to one at Nysa in Caria (14, p. 643), whilst at Cyrene one was in existence in 13 b.c. (Böckh, C./.G. 5361). Relevant in this connection are the words of the author of the Cynegetica , a native of Syria, in speaking of an Ethiopian lion trans- ported through Libya: Cyn . 3.46-7 'I have seen, not merely heard of, that terrible beast, when it was transported to be a spectacle for royal eyes ', sÔpocKov, où irudópriv, keIvóv ttotê Ofļpa Sacpoivóv, / KoipaviKoīs t' enoÀev SicaroļjīTriļjios ôçôaXiioIaiv. Attention should at least have been drawn to Oppian's simile by those who have noted the one in Quintus of Smyrna, 6.532-6, which is also taken from the amphitheatre (see the list of similes in A. S. Way's Loeb edition of Quintus), and who have treated it as one of the very few reflections in that most conventional of poets of Quintus' contemporary world, i.e. probably the latter part of the fourth century A.D. For the sake of compari- son I give it here in full, necessarily in my own translation, since A. S. Way's is grossly inaccurate. ' They turned this way and that, as boars or lions in the midst of an enclo- sure on that day when kings bring together some men and cruelly pen them in pre- paring for them an evil death at the hands of mighty beasts, and the beasts within the enclosure devour any slave who draws near them', Sijkõocç SapSócTTTOvaiv, ö tis &lt;j&lt;píaiv eyyùs īktitoci. It will be observed that there is no apparent dependence on Oppian and that the reference is not to a contest between armed hunter and beast, but to the mass butchering of human victims, presumably criminals, by wild beasts. Com- parison with Quintus serves to emphasize the exquisite art of Oppian on this scale. The situation is accurately conjured up by him in a few words, and every action is brought before our eyes without ambiguity. Biirner was quite right when he praised Oppian for the 'Kleinmalerei' and the 'Ausführlichkeit' of his similes. In Book 3 of the Hal . from line 499 to line 519 the hesitant approach of the grey mullet (KHOTpeùs) to a baited hook with its apparent alternation of suspicion and con- fidence is likened first to a doubtful wayfarer at a crossroads, and then with greater aptness to a young girl in the absence of her mother torn between her desire to take something to eat and the fear of her mother's sudden return. Such is the familiarity of the former picture that we could well apply to it the epithet 'much- worn', TroÀÙTpnr- toç, which Oppian gives to TpióSoiai at line 502, and so the foremost critical question is what life the poet has succeeded in injecting into so well-worn a theme. An ob- viously contrived touch of colour and one particularly appropriate to the watery con- text is the comparison at lines 505-6: 'and his (i.e. the wayfarer's) mind fluctuates like the wave', vóos 8é oí f)UTe kö|jcc / everrai. The charm and freshness, on the other hand, of the second simile are fully and immediately satisfying. So exemplary is the anthropo- morphism of this passage as well for its strict and minute accuracy of external 3-2</page><page sequence="13">36 A. W. JAMES observation as for its acute and sympathetic psychological insight that I feel justified in giving it in full. Here Oppian has succeeded in grafting some of the choicest fruits of Alexandrianism into a literary form which the Alexandrians were all too seldom able to make truly poetical. The following is my own verse rendering of the passage based on Mair's prose translation: Then soon the mullet, the odour reaching him, At first his distance from the hook maintains, And there with eyes askance regards the snare. Just as a stranger stays, who comes by chance To some much- trodden crossways. Now his heart Is set to take the left road, now the right; On this side and on that he looks; his mind Uncertain like an ocean wave revolves, Until on single plan at last he's fix'd. E'en so the mullet ponders variously, Now guile suspecting, now a harmless feast; At length his mind impels him nigh his doom. But back at once in fear he starts, for oft, In touching, terror takes him and prevails. As when some infant maid, her mother gone, For dainty morsel yearns, and yet to touch She fears, by dread of mother's wrath deterred, Till rather than withdraw she dares the deed. With stealth she advances, and again turns back; Now courage fills her heart, now mortal fear, Her eyes the while upon the door intent. Thus nears and thus retreats the gentle fish. I should have liked to deal with the other major category of Oppian's imaginative art, his use of mythological and anecdotal elements, sometimes with a strong philo- sophical tinge, in particular his own version of a Stoic hymn to Zeus and his fine address to "Epcoç, which shows the unmistakable influence of both Sophocles and Apollonius Rhodius. Wilamowitz once had occasion ( Die Kultur der Gegenwart , Teil i, Abteilung viii, Die griechische und lateinische Literatur und Sprache , 3rd ed. 191 1, p. 255) to describe the Haliéutica as 'shockingly boring', 'erschreckend langweilig'. His reason seems to have been the extremely derivative nature of the subject-matter, but that raises a very big query about a great deal of ancient literature. I hope I have given adequate reason for regarding the Haliéutica as not a great, but an accomplished and enjoyable work. SEL W YN COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE A. W. JAMES</page></plain_text>
