<plain_text> <page sequence="1">       CANNIBALIZING OVID: ALLUSION, STORYTELLING   AND DECEPTION IN JUVENAL 15*      Abstract: Satire 15 is not a straightforward narrative about Egyptian practices of cannibalism,  but a stylized, rhetorical exercise in intertextuality. Juvenal undermines his narratorial authority  through an ongoing engagement with Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Juvenal hints that storytellers  may sometimes be deceitful, and in turn he seems to embrace this role. Throughout the satire,  intertextuality takes the place of proof as both exempla and argumentation are corroborated by  means of Ovidian allusion. As a result, the cannibalization at the core of the satire may be read as  analogous to Juvenal’s literary duplicity.      F rom its outset, Juvenal’s Satire 15 promises a tale of exotic, foreign intrigue at a remove from the busy (and usually corrupt) streets of Rome depicted in  other satires. Outrageous animals (crocodiles, snakes, monkeys) and crazed  Egyptians (demens Aegyptos) populate the hypothetical questions at the poem’s  opening. The narrative proceeds to a description of a gory brawl between two  neighboring Egyptian tribes, a conflict that ends only when the conquering tribe  devours an unfortunate soul who had fallen while attempting to flee the battle.  Juvenal’s derogatory descriptions of African customs, and the relish he takes in  describing the sordid details of the conquerors’ cannibalistic feast, have received  the better part of scholarly attention; as a result, this satire tends to be read as  evidence of Juvenal’s own racism or the racism of the author’s persona.1 But this    * I presented earlier versions of this paper at CAMWS 2008 (Tuscon, AZ) and John Carroll  University in 2011; many thanks are due to the many people who have helped to see it through to  its current iteration, including Patricia Rosenmeyer, Carole Newlands, Joy Reeber, Valerie Reed  Hickman and Sam Rametta as well as Laurel Fulkerson and the anonymous reviewers for CJ.   1 Powell (1979) 188 calls Juvenal “dyspeptic and xenophobic;” Tennant (1995) 134 claims the  poem was written for “an audience eager for a laugh and ready to indulge its own racial, cultural and  religious prejudices.” Other critics shift the charge to the author’s persona. Anderson (1987) 212  suggests the poet creates a persona within the satire in the guise of a “speaker who sneers at the  barbaric cannibals...yet unconsciously betrays the worse faults of Roman militarism.” Finally,  through this shift from author to persona, McKim (1986) 59 has argued that the poet is able to  undermine the voice of the satiric speaker and those who might share in those prejudices; yet even  this interpretation still relies on the trope of racism as the central issue at stake in the satire. Most   THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 109.4 (2014) 481–499  </page> <page sequence="2"> 482 KRISTEN EHRHARDT  interpretation is ultimately unsatisfactory. Juvenal’s xenophobia is a common  theme and disdain for people from foreign lands fills his satires.2 Although many  readings seem to stop here, this particular African incident occupies only about a  third of the entire satire; to read the poem solely in light of this initial episode is to  miss the broader theme of narrative deceit in the guise of literary cannibalism that  runs throughout the poem.   Indeed, the judgment of racism usually arises when scholars take Juvenal at his  word, accepting his claims to have been an eyewitness to the scene of  cannibalistic slaughter (an improbable claim, as we will see). The supposedly  eyewitness account of the central tale is just one example of narrative deceit;  throughout the satire, Juvenal repeatedly undermines his own authority. He dons  the satiric persona of an expert, insinuating that he knows and speaks the truth.3  Yet as Juvenal introduces different forms of reasoning, he unravels each form by  means of a series of allusions that not only provide no corroboration for the story  at hand but also actually work against the seeming truth of his story.   Indeed, many of the vignettes populating the satire—including the African  cannibalism scene—are not actually straightforward examples “ripped from the  headlines” as Juvenal presents them, but are carefully curated exempla from  earlier Latin literature, with a particular nod toward Ovid's Metamorphoses.4 Here,                                                                                                        recently, however, scholars have begun to read the satire with an eye toward the meta-literary:  Vincent’s (2011) 240-42 take on 15 does examine the satire on the grounds of its “pseudo-realistic”  storytelling by examining its connections to ancient novels by reading the satire as a form of a  “traveler’s tale.”  2 Although the first book of satires is most marked by xenophobic ire (against the Egyptians in S.  1, various Easterners (Assyrians, Phrygians) in S. 2, and the Greeks in S. 3), Juvenal's hatred of other  peoples is peppered throughout later satires as well. He maintains his contempt of Egyptians and  Greeks in S. 6 (Eppia, the senator's wife runs off with a gladiator to Egypt), and adds Jewish women  to his list as well. This anti-Semitism is hardly solitary occurrence, reappearing in S. 8 and 14.  3 On the idea of satiric personae, see Anderson (1982) 313, who opened the field of satire to  allow for readings beyond the strictly biographical. Braund (1996) provides an overview of  different, potential masks. More recently, Rosen (2007) 220–3 has suggested that the metaphor of  persona, though helpful in avoiding the biographical fallacy, is not necessarily helpful when it comes  to understanding the internal workings of the poem itself.  4 Highet (1951) and Courtney (1980) both list a number of allusions in Juvenal to various  Roman authors. Thomas (1958) concentrates specifically on Ovidian references throughout all of  Juvenal’s satires, particularly noting instances of verbal echoes. Although she concludes that  “Juvenal’s debt to Ovid was considerable and much more profound than has hitherto been  realized,” her analysis describes these instances as parody or “conscious” or “unconscious  imitation.” While Thomas notes a few instances of Ovidian parallels in Satire 15 (Met. 1.84 with S.  15.147, Am. 1.15, 34 with S. 15.46 and P.1.10, 39 with S. 15.127), she does not include most of the    </page> <page sequence="3">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 483      Ovidian allusions undergo new metamorphoses—foul feasts are digested,  regurgitated and spat out, befitting their new home in a satiric text.5 Even though  these allusions ought to provide a level of grauitas, in Juvenal's hands they do the  opposite. By picking loaded examples, intertextuality becomes a vehicle for  authorial deception.6 Even as he makes claims that rely on common sense,  firsthand observation or philosophical authority, he simultaneously undermines  those claims by couching them in the terms of another literary source.7 Seen in  this light, Juvenal’s use of out-of-context allusions intentionally muddles matters,  but this muddling and deception are only part of the satiric project. Juvenal’s  repeated allusions to perverted feasts in Ovid are themselves a variety of  cannibalism, in this case a literary one in which satire gorges on and surpasses  epic itself.8  The issues of deception in relationship to the role of the narrator are  highlighted early in the satire, when Juvenal provides a meta-literary parallel that  underlines the possibility of lying storytellers within a Homeric context (13–16):                                                                                                        passages discussed in this paper. Vincent (2011) 252 has also recently noted the presence of an  Ovidian influence in the satire’s central cannibalism scene.  5 Corrupt feast scenes have a long history in the genre of Roman satire, e.g. Hor. S. 2.8, Persius 5,  Petronius’ Cena Trimalchionis, as well as within Juvenal’s own oeuvre in S. 4, 5 and 9.  Yet other  distorted satiric feasts do not resort to cannibalism.  Extending Gowers’ insight (1993) 43, that  “when food appears in Roman literature it always has some connection with the style of the work to  which it belongs,” from food scenes to feast scenes, the cannibalism of this satire seems ripe for the  metapoetical pickings.    6 Freudenburg (2001) 27–40 examines Horace's use of allusions in S. 1.1 to Vergil and Lucretius  as a way of incorporating earlier voices as “memories shaken out” into a satiric text with a different  agenda (33). His insight that allusions in Horace “pose a threat to satire's attractive, straight-talking  ways,” (39) is particularly salient here—we might suspect that if Horace used allusion in satire in  this way, that a savvy reader of later satire might also be aware of the potentially deceptive nature of  quoted language in the genre.  7 In her examination of the philosophical program that runs throughout Book 5, Keane calls  Satire 15 the “philosophical climax” of the book (2007) 42; but she reads Juvenal’s interest in  philosophy more as an eclectic mix of Cicero and Pythagoras with a particular attention to virtue  than a study in truth and knowledge itself.  8 Plaza (2006) 340 has recently suggested that the trope of cannibalism may be read as a  metaphor for satire turning on itself: “If food stands for the genre of satire, and the food is human  flesh, devoured by humans, then the genre of satire is devoured by its like, i.e. satire devours itself.”  This insight is close to the argument of this paper, that cannibalism functions not simply as a story  to highlight the awfulness of foreigners, but also on a literary level. Yet Plaza focuses on feasts and  humor, while the argument at hand focuses on the use of cannibalism as a metaphor for  intertextuality.    </page> <page sequence="4"> 484 KRISTEN EHRHARDT       attonito cum  tale super cenam facinus narraret Vlixes  Alcinoo, bilem aut risum fortasse quibusdam    mouerat ut mendax aretalogus.    When, over supper, Ulysses told of so great a crime to the  astonished Alcinoos, he provoked anger or perhaps laughter in  some, like a lying storyteller. 9    By drawing attention to the art and artifice of the storyteller, Juvenal begins to  problematize a narrative’s relationship with the truth, in this case, through the  genre of epic. Positioning himself as Ulysses, while we, the audience, fill the  sandals of the astonished and skeptical Phaeacians, Juvenal inverts the Homeric  account. In contrast with the Homeric version, in which the Phaeacians believed  (or at least accepted) Ulysses’ fantastic tales of his journey, Juvenal suggests a far  less agreeable reception. This directly challenges the Homeric tradition: at the  beginning of Odyssey 13, when Odysseus finishes his story the crowd falls silent,  awestruck, until Alcinoos breaks the silence and offers to help the hero return  home.10 In the satire, however, when confronted with the Homeric episodes of  people-eating (the Laestrygonians and the Cyclopes), Ulysses’ astonished  audience is filled with disbelief and ridicule to the extent that the suggestion is  raised that their storyteller could be mendax.11 The change in audience reception  at stake in this passage is not simply a satiric turn but a key to reading this satire  generally.  It is at this early point in the satire that Juvenal ties together truth and fiction as  essential issues, muddling the roles of recollection, storytelling and literature. The  satiric version of Homer retells the traditional account while implying that it is    9 I have used Clausen’s (1959) text for all quotations of Juvenal; Tarrant (2004) for Ovid’s Met.  All translations are my own.  10 Juvenal deviates from the original Homeric scene in content as well: Homer does not name  Elpenor as one of the crew members that Circe turned into swine, but Juvenal does (21–2). While  Courtney (1980) 597 notices the inconsistency, he attributes it to a slip of memory, but does not  connect it to the ongoing mendacity of Juvenal’s Homeric moment.  11 Admittedly, the wily Odysseus would seldom be anyone’s idea of an honest man. Even in  Homer, he builds an alternate tale of his journeys which includes lying directly to Athena (Od.  13.256ff.) Ancient authors doubted Odysseus as well: cf. Arist. Po. 1460a; Str. 1.2.9. Richardson  (2006) goes so far as to call the hero a “con-artist” (337) as he traces Odysseus’ web of deception  throughout the epic.    </page> <page sequence="5">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 485      the true version. Here, Juvenal contradicts the audience’s knowledge of the  legend, and then reclaims his original stance of veracity, even in the face of his  revisions.12 By establishing a logic of quotation and contradiction as a precedent,  Juvenal makes a claim for the importance of corroborated evidence, implying  that his own stories will reach these standards. Yet the evidence that he provides  is cloaked in literary reference and allusions stand in for proof. In the end,  Juvenal’s initial use of Homer points to the ongoing engagement with truth and  lies that he will follow throughout the rest of the satire, but using Ovid as his  guide in epic.  The analysis that follows traces how Juvenal undercuts various knowledge  claims by means of allusions, particularly to Ovid, throughout Satire 15. This  reading roughly follows the structure of the satire itself. I begin by examining the  claim to common sense in the satire’s first line. Although the focus of this paper is  on Ovidian allusions, Juvenal begins with a claim that goes back to Cicero but  which still incorporates an Ovidian note. Next, I look at the supposedly  eyewitness account of Egyptian cannibalism, typically seen as the heart of Satire  15, that clearly bears an Ovidian imprint. Juvenal continues to shed his credibility  when the subsequent account of the Vascones’ cannibalism also echoes epic, in  which the extra corroboration comes from his rhetorical training, rather than his  own experience. Finally, throughout the satire we find philosophy as a locus of  authority, from Cicero’s philosophical writings, to the final section that distorts  Ovid’s version of Pythagoras in Met. 15. By concluding with the figure of  Pythagoras, Juvenal combines the themes of distorted feasts and false narrators  with an ongoing engagement with the Metamorphoses that pushes the limits of  satiric intertextuality.  Juvenal begins Satire 15 with a rhetorical question that he answers over the  course of the next several lines (1–8).     Quis nescit, Volusi Bithynice, qualia demens  Aegyptos portenta colat? crocodilon adorat  pars haec, illa pauet saturam serpentibus ibin.  effigies sacri nitet aurea cercopitheci,  dimidio magicae resonant ubi Memnone chordae               atque uetus Thebe centum iacet obruta portis.    12 Anderson (1987) 205–6 notes Juvenal’s tendency toward “distortion,” both of Homer and of  Egyptian superstitions, throughout the introduction to the satire. Yet, distortion seems too weak a  term; moreover, Anderson never questions why these distortions occur.    </page> <page sequence="6"> 486 KRISTEN EHRHARDT  illic aeluros, hic piscem fluminis, illic   oppida tota canem venerantur, nemo Dianem.    Volusius of Bithynia, who doesn’t know the sorts of creatures crazy  Egypt worships? This bunch worships the crocodile, that one fears  the ibis, sated by snakes. A golden statue of the sacred monkey  gleams, where magical chords resound from the halved Memnon  and ancient Thebes, with a hundred gates, lies broken. There a cat,  here a river’s fish, over there an entire town reveres a dog, but no one  worships Diana.    The first two words of the satire, quis nescit, draw readers in on the grounds of  common knowledge: the answer to the question “who doesn't know...?” is  clearly “no one, of course.” From the very beginning, Juvenal positions himself as  one of the crowd, with the same knowledge as everyone else. Moreover, he  predetermines our expectations concerning the subject by characterizing it as  demens before he even mentions Egypt. Thus, his description that follows  operates on a double assumption: not only does everyone know about religious  practices of Egyptians, but also, we all know that these people are crazy.13  As he continues, Juvenal answers his own rhetorical question, proving his own  knowledge, by listing the animals worshipped by various people in that foreign  land. Juvenal’s list includes many of the same Egyptian animals as Cicero’s  Tusculan Disputations, borrowing the random collection of ibis, snake, cat, dog  and crocodile from its predecessor (Tusc. 5.27.78).14 The marked parallels    13 Issac (2004) 354–69 points out a number of ways in which the Greeks and Romans were  prejudiced against Egyptians, noting that they often depicted the culture as fraudulent and  highlighted “controversial aspects” like Egyptian animal cults.  14 Cicero, Tusc. 5.27.78: Aegyptorum morem quis ignorat? quorum inbutae mentes pravitatis erroribus  quamvis carnificinam prius subierint quam ibim aut aspidem aut felem aut canem aut corcodillum violenti  quorum etiamsi inprudentes quippiam fecerint, poenam nullam recusent. “Who is unaware of the custom  of the Egyptians? Those whose minds, steeped in the errors of depravity, would submit to an  executioner before they would injure an ibis or a snake, a cat, a dog or a crocodile. Even if it were  unintentional they would reject no punishment.” The satire’s list of animals mimics Cicero’s but  Juvenal teases his audience further through slight alterations: thus Cicero’s aspis becomes serpentes  within the body of the ibis, the felis becomes aeluri, and a river fish (piscis fluminis, 7) floats into the  center of the discussion. While this passage’s menagerie has clear parallels with Juvenal's list,  Courtney (1980) 592 also cites another possible Ciceronean allusion for Juvenal’s demens  characterization: Cum poetarum autem errore coniungere licet portenta magorum Aegyptiorumque in  eodem genere dementiam, tum etiam vulgi opiniones, quae in maxima inconstantia veritatis ignoratione  versantur (Cic. N. D. 1.16.43). “Moreover, along with the poets’ deception, one can connect the    </page> <page sequence="7">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 487      between the two texts may be read as a variation on an Alexandrian footnote, with  the opening question quis nescit...? standing in for the expected ferunt or fama est  as a method of poetic citation.15 Juvenal knows these things (as do his readers)  because of the earlier authors to whom he alludes. And so, within the first few  lines of the satire, intertextuality is introduced as a way to verify knowledge  claims.  Yet Juvenal’s intertextuality in this passage extends beyond Cicero. The final  word of the third line, ibin, may be seen not only in connection to Cicero’s ibim,  but also as an oblique literary reference to Ovid’s invective-filled exile poem, the  Ibis. The invocation of the Ibis, a poem filled with grotesque revenge fantasies  within a mythological context, gives us a forewarning of the cannibalism scenes in  this satire. The peculiar allusion to Ovid already in the third line casts the satire in  a new light, marking a movement toward the macabre as well as providing a  program for storytelling and self-conscious genre-play within the satire. For, we  see that this is no ordinary ibis; this ibin is saturam, with snakes. If the reference to  Cicero reminded us to be on guard for allusions, yoking the bird to saturam  marks the next step in Juvenal’s allusive game, as he uses the original form of the  generic term to refer back to his own stuffed satire.16  As Juvenal concludes his list of animals (and vegetables) sacred to the  Egyptians, he adds a characteristic half-line twist: “but it is permitted to feed on  human flesh” (carnibus humanis uesci licet, 13). The use of the impersonal verb,  licet, again implies a sort of an unspoken, common sense authority behind this  statement. But how does anyone know it is permitted? While Juvenal has  appealed to common knowledge—through recourse to Cicero—previously,  here he chooses not to corroborate his statement.17 Instead, with an abrupt, mid- line shift, Juvenal begins to unravel his own narratorial authority as he finishes  this same line by abruptly changing the subject and shifting to an epic mode,                                                                                                        omens of the Magi and the Egyptians’ madness as the same sort of thing—and even common  opinions which become exceptionally fickle by the ignorance of truth.” Here, Courtney’s interest  lies in Cicero’s connection to the Egyptians’ dementia and not the broader context of the quotation,  in which Cicero’s complaint involves matters of truth: poets’ lies, religion and common belief.  15 For background on the phenomenon of Alexandrian footnotes see Ross (1975) 78; Hinds  (1998).  16 On the multiple etymologies of satura, from satyrs to fullness, sausages and more, see Coffey  (1976) 11-18. Gowers (1993) 111-18 highlights the connection of many of the etymologies with  food and stuffed bodies as regular concerns within the genre itself.  17 Although he could have: Courtney (1980) 595 notes D. S. 1.84.1 as evidence of earlier  Egyptian cannibalism.    </page> <page sequence="8"> 488 KRISTEN EHRHARDT  channeling the scene of Ulysses as mendax aretalogus in Homer’s Odyssey,  discussed previously (13–16). The interjection of the much-traveled, wild- storied, possibly untrustworthy hero at this particular moment—in the middle of  a line where our own narrator is making wild claims—functions as a signal to the  audience that we too should be on guard, that a medax aretalogus may be close at  hand.  Once Juvenal has prepared his audience for his own story by suggesting that  cannibalism is a typical behavior of those foreign Egyptians, he contextualizes the  events of his tale of cannibalism within the timeframe of a specific, recent  consulship: nos miranda quidem sed nuper consule Iunco / gesta super calidae  referemus moenia Copti (“Indeed, I'll tell the amazing events from the recent  consulship of Iuncus beyond the walls of scorched Coptus,” 27-8). This datable  reference gives his story a veneer of truth, but does not in itself guarantee that the  story comes from firsthand observation. Next he introduces two opposing  African tribes, the people of Ombi and Tentyra, who have a long-standing hatred  of one another’s gods. The Tentyrians decide to have a festival for their gods,  while the Ombians decide to crash the party and to destroy their enemies while  they are drunk. The location of the brawl, then, is set as a symposium of sorts,  mixing sympotic trappings (couches, tables, dancing, music, perfume, flowers,  garlands) and merum, unmixed wine, as befits the uncouth foreigners (43–8).   In feeling, situation and language, Juvenal creates a battle that echoes Ovid’s  disrupted banquet in the battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs in Metamorphoses  12.220–535. Although there is no actual cannibalism in the original, Ovid’s  depiction of a brawl that begins at a wedding feast is long and filled with  unrestrained and ever-escalating violence, epic in proportion and style.18 Juvenal  recalls the Ovidian scene’s gruesome violence throughout the battle. From the  very beginning, the Tentyrians reason that the festival would make an ideal time  to attack their hated neighbors: adde quod et facilis uictoria de madidis et / blaesis  atque mero titubantibus (“Add to this that it would be an easy victory over the  sodden men, stammering and tipsy from the unmixed wine,” 47-8). The  Egyptians’ plan, centered on their neighbors’ inability to hold their wine, seems to  echo a scene from Met. 12. Here, Theseus hurls a huge, ancient krater at the    18 Indeed in his commentary, Courtney (1980) 600 notes an allusion in Juvenal’s lines 53–4, uice  teli / saeuit nuda manus, “the bare hand rages instead of a spear,” to Ovid’s 12.381–2, saevique uicem  praestantia teli / cornua, “[who bore] exceptional horns instead of a savage spear.” But he does not  examine the allusion further or even suggest a similarity between the two disrupted feasts.    </page> <page sequence="9">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 489      centaur, Eurytus (Met. 12.238–40).     sanguinis ille globos pariter cerebrumque merumque  vulnere et ore uomens madida resupinus harena  calcitrat.           He, spewing out globs of blood and brains and wine equally from  wound and mouth, fell backwards as he trampled the sodden  ground.      The centaur is smashed, from both the consumption of wine and the physical  impact of a wine vessel. The Tentyrians’ plan of destruction, which rests upon  merum and madidus, anticipates the Ovidian scene filled with wine and gore that  is soon to follow.   Indeed, in the middle of the Ombians’ festive setting, the anticipated brawl  begins. The men, half of them drunk and the other half seething with hatred,  begin to fight with their bare hands, leaving no one with even an uninjured nose  (uix cuiquam aut nulli toto certamine nasus / integer, 55–6). This nasus at the end of  the line (55) carries the possibility of a double allusion. First, the word might  remind a careful reader of yet another crime committed during Metamorphoses’  centauromachy: the particularly gruesome episode when the Centaur, Amycus,  crushes the face of the Lapith Celadon, and drives his nose (here, naris) back into  his face, attaching it to his palate (Met. 12.245–57). In this case, the shading that  the barbarity of the original scene brings would certainly not be out of place in  the satire. But the emphatic placement of nasus at the end of the line allows us to  see a second, meta-literary connection: Juvenal signals the earlier poet by name,  as a way of highlighting the highly allusive nature of this segment.  As the battle continues, both sides of the crowd shift from hand-to-hand  combat and start to hurl rocks, but satiric saxa are no epic rocks (62–8):       ergo acrior impetus et iam  saxa inclinatis per humum quaesita lacertis  incipiunt torquere, domestica seditioni  tela, nec hunc lapidem, qualis et Turnus et Aiax,                uel quo Tydides percussit pondere coxam  Aeneae, sed quem ualeant emittere dextrae  illis dissimiles et nostro tempore natae.       </page> <page sequence="10"> 490 KRISTEN EHRHARDT  Thus the attack becomes more bitter and already they begin to hurl  the rocks—sought across the ground. The weapons were fit for a  riot, not the kind of stone that Turnus or Ajax held, nor of the weight  with which Tydeus struck Aeneas’ hip, but the kind that hands, born  in our time (unlike theirs), were strong enough to throw.     In contrast to the weapons in the Ovidian brawl—which begin with sympotic  equipment (cups, kraters, Met. 12.242–4), shift to furniture like lamps and altars,  and eventually become uprooted trees (Met. 12.327–9, 356–7)—Juvenal spends  four lines (64–7) describing just how un-epic his story’s rocks are by invoking  and denying possible heroic parallels. The qualitative difference between the  contemporary rocks and the stones of yesteryear becomes emblematic of the  current degradation of humanity itself: men nowadays are just not heroes  anymore. The story continues as the fight is renewed when one side adds another  weapon, arrows, to the arsenal. As the Tentyrians run away, one man slips and  falls and becomes a victim as his enemies devour him, raw, to the very last  morsel.19   At this point, we may recall our narrator's earlier dismay at Ulysses’ lack of  witnesses (13–16). Just like the potentially untrustworthy Homeric hero, Juvenal  has not provided any truly corroborating evidence for his own tale, beyond a brief  reference to the time period (Iuncus’ consulship, 27–8). Other than his allusions  to Ovid, he gives no clue about the sources—historical or fictional—for this  story. Indeed, contrary to scholars who see Satire 15 as evidence that Juvenal was  once in Egypt, it seems to me that this can hardly be proof. Juvenal even points to  the shifting barometer of truth by changing his own characterization of it: the  story that began as an exemplum (32) suddenly becomes a fabula (72) in the  middle. This shift from moralistic story (exemplum) to fiction (fabula) is subtle  but noteworthy because as a storyteller, Juvenal points to his own internal  inconsistency. In the end, this story tells us little about Egyptian tribal wars but  quite a bit more about Juvenal’s self-fashioning as a worthy heir to the traditions  of Ovid and Homer.  As the satire continues, Juvenal turns away from the Egyptian scene of    19 Gowers (1993) 199–201 notes that even uncooked, the man was chopped into frusta et  particulas (15.79) and that the diners were contenta cadavere crudo (15.83). She translates frusta et  particulas as “bite sized pieces” and notes how Juvenal uses the same frusta in other satires to refer to  a beggar’s ration. And, even though this cannibalism is supposed to be a novel crime, he uses similar  ideas to hint at the same depravity in earlier satires.    </page> <page sequence="11">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 491      slaughter, while continuing to focus his narrative lens on the theme of  cannibalism. In this case he shifts from supposedly first-hand knowledge to an  older story, the tale of the Vascones, a Spanish tribe (now the Basque) that did  actually once resort to cannibalism after a long siege in 72 BCE. Due to the story’s  popularity in rhetorical declamations,20 Juvenal’s audience would have been  aware of the fate of the Vascones, so his tale is abbreviated; the insertion of the  story is simply to provide a counter-example to Egyptian savagery. Here again,  Juvenal calls upon the communal knowledge of this tradition to back up his  claims with a poetic footnote: ut fama est (93). He spends nearly as many lines  forgiving the Vascones (103–6) as he devotes to talking about the cannibalism  episode itself.21 The condensed story of the Vascones highlights the agony of  famine and its resulting cannibalism (99–103).    post omnis herbas, post cuncta animalia, quidquid  cogebat uacui uentris furor, hostibus ipsis    pallorem ac maciem et tenuis miserantibus artus,  membra aliena fame lacerabant, esse parati  et sua.    After all the grasses, after all the animals—whatever the anger of the  empty stomach forced, when the enemies themselves were pitying  their paleness, leanness and delicate frames, they tore at one  another’s limbs in hunger, ready to eat even their own.     Even in a story that is told ostensibly as a pitiable counterexample to the  African slaughter, Juvenal dabbles in Ovidian intertextuality. This time, however,  the allusions are trickier. The verbal echoes come from two passages of the same  story, and far more is elided than spoken outright. Yet, a careful eye may see that  as he adopts the position of an omniscient narrator about an event that occurred  two centuries earlier, he draws on the language and tone of the Ovidian tale of the  man who ate himself: Erysichthon. First, the effects of Juvenal's fames recall  Ovid’s description of the personified Famine whom Ceres sends to embrace the  doomed man after he cuts down her sacred grove (Met. 8.801–5):    20 Courtney (1980) 603.  21 Forgiveness abounds, since it was a different situation and they were driven to cannibalism by  severe famine. Forgiveness is found not only among men and gods (S. 15.103–4) but even the  fallen themselves: “And even the ghosts of those who fed on their bodies could have forgiven them.”  (et quibus illorum poterant ignoscere manes / quorum corporibus uescebantur 105–6)    </page> <page sequence="12"> 492 KRISTEN EHRHARDT    hirtus erat crinis, caua lumina, pallor in ore,  labra incana situ, scabrae rubigine fauces,  dura cutis, per quam spectari uiscera possent;  ossa sub incuruis exstabant arida lumbis,  uentris erat pro uentre locus;         Her hair was shaggy, her eyes hollow, a paleness in her face, lips grey  with neglect, throat scabby with blight, rough skinned, through  which the guts could be seen. Her dry bones stood out under the  curved-in limbs. There was a place for a stomach instead of a  stomach.     In Juvenal’s version, famine is introduced as a state at the center of line 102  (fame), present among the wan Vascones as they begin to tear each other apart.  Ovid’s doubled emphasis of Famine’s stomach (uentris...uentre, Met. 8.805)  becomes assonance for Juvenal, uacui uentris (103), again centered in the satirical  line. Additionally, through the perspective of their enemies, the Vascones  themselves take on a characteristic of the Ovidian Famine, pallor (Met. 8.801;  S.15.101).   The parallels begun by the presence of famine continue in the descriptions of  bodily ruin as people are forced to devour themselves. In Ovid, Erysichthon eats  every possible food source and spends all his wealth in his quest to fill his belly.  His consumption is all encompassing and he is left with nothing other than his  shape-shifting daughter. Ultimately, Erysichthon resorts to autophagia, ripping  his own body to pieces as a form of nourishment: ipse suos artus lacero diuellere  morsu / coepit et infelix minuendo corpus alebat (“He begins to rip his own limbs in  mangled bits and the unfortunate body was fed by its reduction,” Met. 8.877–8).   Juvenal echoes the limb-ripping of Ovid's tale: the product of Erysichthon’s  ripping, lacero morsu, shifts to the plural lacerabant as adjective becomes action (S.  15.102). Likewise, the first words of this Metamorphoses passage, ipse suos artus  (Met. 8.877), parallel the final words of the satire’s lines 100 and 101, ipsis and  artus, together with the enjambed sua (103), providing a similar emphasis on  limbs and selves. Juvenal’s text tears the Ovidian text apart, rearranging words  and ideas, leaving out vital parts while continuing to hint toward the original.   Admittedly, the parallels between these passages are slim and far less obvious  than the first cannibalism episode. Although we can find similarities in language  between the two, they are scattered; we are left to our own devices to fit them    </page> <page sequence="13">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 493      together like a puzzle. Yet it is possible that Juvenal’s very creation of a far-fetched,  credulity-straining allusion may itself be an Ovidian intertext, mirroring Ovid’s  own twists on Alexandrian footnotes.22 In this case, the subtlety of the intertext  may highlight the levels of variation at play within the satire, in this case,  juxtaposing the earlier, obvious allusion with one more tenuous. In these few  lines, Juvenal merges a rhetorical exercise with epic, changing his method of  reasoning even though his reliance on both cannibalism as a subject and Ovid as  a guide has remained constant. His consistency in this regard cloaks his literary  shenanigans.  For it is worth noticing that the situation between Erysichthon and the  Vascones differs by a large degree. Famine befalls Erysichthon because he  hubristically razes a sacred grove; by contrast, the Vascones’ famine is endured as  the result of a Roman city siege—as such, the blame for the latter case of  cannibalism is placed outside the cannibals. Indeed, the juxtaposition of the  Ovidian parallel undercuts Juvenal’s own statements. As a result, this passage is  more problematic that it appears on the surface: the Vascones were not resisting  just some other barbarian tribe: their besiegers were the Romans. Thus, the  Romans—including Juvenal himself—must be implicated in the barbaric  behavior in some way as well.23 The additional shading of the Erysichthon myth  hints that this is still an uneasy situation,24 both ironic and close to home, even as  the narrator claims otherwise.   The conclusion of the satire shifts to a different examination of knowledge,  drawing attention to philosophy itself. Here Juvenal makes a pointed parallel  between the end of Satire 15 and the fifteenth, and final, book of the  Metamorphoses through the figure of Pythagoras. At the end of the Metamorphoses,  Ovid shifts to the figure of Pythagoras, engaging the ancient philosopher in a  discussion of the nature of beasts and men.25 Here, too, Juvenal draws upon    22 Curley (2013) 184–6 suggests that Ovid pushed the idea of allusive footnotes toward  “intratextual footnotes,” in which “the less the poet narrates, the clearer the reference, and the more  the reader is encouraged to seek out analogies elsewhere in the poem.”  23 Anderson (1987) 209.  24 This unease is especially marked in the shift of ipsis—from Erysichthon to the Roman forces  who sympathize with the besieged townfolk in Juvenal’s version. To what extent did Romans  accept that they were at the root of the problem (the city siege) which led to the eventual  cannibalism? Alston (1996) 103 suggests “this Satire, like Juvenal’s others, was also concerned with  Roman society, though almost certainly a distorted version of that society. It was not ‘them’ but ‘us’  who were being discussed in Satire XV.”  25 Keane (2007) 41–8, who reads Juvenal’s fifth book of satires through a philosophical lens, sees    </page> <page sequence="14"> 494 KRISTEN EHRHARDT  Ovid’s Pythagoras for the final quarter of this satire, saving the mention of his  name itself for the penultimate line. As Hardie and Knox have observed, Ovid’s  speech of Pythagoras is a deeply intertextual feast, recalling the great storehouses  of Latin literary history (Ennius, Lucretius, Vergil) as well as Homer and  Callimachus.26 This intertextuality allows Ovid to insert himself into that  distinguished lineage. When Juvenal invokes Ovid’s Pythagoras at the same point  in his satire (namely, at the end), he includes himself in that same train of authors.  And yet, through the medium of satire, he derails it. Throughout this section,  Juvenal’s version of Pythagoras returns to parts of Ovid, but the satire mixes  things up by reversing arguments with misleading allusions and blatantly getting  things wrong.   Juvenal begins by discussing how and why Nature gave humans tears (131– 40), suggesting that tears, as a barometer of emotion, are evidence of humanity’s  difference from animals (142–7). This emphasis on weeping points back to Met.  15.229–36.27 These lines, which begin with an athlete weeping over what his  body has become (fletque Milon senior... 15.229), lead to a vivid image of old age  as not only a destructive but actively consuming force (Met. 15.234–6):     tuque, inuidiosa uetustas,  omnia destruitis uitiataque dentibus aeui        paulatim lenta consumitis omnia morte.    You, hateful old age, destroy everything; with your teeth, bit-by-bit,  you devour all things spoiled by time in a slow death.    In the Ovidian version, weeping has no bearing on humanity in a positive way;  according to Ovid’s Pythagoras, tears come as people reflect upon old age and  the ravages of time on their own bodies. Rather than positive attributes of  humanity, tears, because of their relationship to old age, become emblematic of a  destructive force.                                                                                                        the combined presence of Cicero and Pythagoras in 15 as a rumination that ultimately shows that  “the practice of philosophy itself separates civilized people from barbarians.”  26 Hardie (1995) examines the speech in detail; he later questions Knox’s (1986) emphasis on  the Callimachean impact in Hardie (1997), expanding the intertextual scope to include the Latin  literary tradition.  27 Anderson (1987) 214 notes this particular allusion to Ovid’s Pythagoras as well. In accounting  for the underlying differences between the text, he calls the satire’s version a “spoof” that  “reinforce[s] the self-destruction of [Juvenal’s] satiric speaker.”    </page> <page sequence="15">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 495      Although the hint of gory consumption in the Ovidian source would certainly  not seem out of place in this satire, nevertheless Juvenal glosses over the original  tone of despair.28 He shifts the allusion in a new direction, suggesting that  humankind’s ability to weep distinguishes us from beasts (separat hoc nos / a grege  mutorum, 142–3) and leads us toward civilization (144–7). Once again Juvenal's  seemingly rational voice proves deceptive: how can he say that only humans  weep? Animals certainly are capable of tears according to Ovid, who recounts the  mourning of Orpheus by birds, beasts and even the landscape (Met. 11.44–9).29  In this case, Juvenal’s patchwork of allusions becomes a sort of an anti-allusion,  similar to the previous Vascones/Erysichthon example. Once again our satirist  employs words and concepts that are somewhat similar to Ovid’s (Pythagoras,  weeping), but he uses the parallel to mislead.   As Juvenal shifts into his final example, he continues to make questionable  claims about animals. According to the satiric Pythagoras, lions, tigers and bears  are peace-loving creatures, living in pacem perpetuam, acting in ways that humans  do not (159–65):    sed iam serpentum maior concordia. parcit  cognatis maculis similis fera. quando leoni                fortior eripuit uitam leo? quo nemore umquam  expirauit aper maioris dentibus apri?  Indica tigris agit rabida cum tigride pacem  perpetuam, saeuis inter se conuenit ursis.  ast homini...           But now there is greater concord among snakes. A similar wild beast  spares his spotted relative. But when has a stronger lion ever  snatched the life of another lion? In what grove has a boar ever  expired by the teeth of a greater boar? The Indian tigress lives in  perpetual peace with the raging tigress, savage bears agree among  themselves. But for man....    Once again, as he did at the beginning of the satire, Juvenal draws a parallel by    28 It is worth noting that Ovid’s take on tears and old age is itself an allusion to Lucretius’ views  on old age throughout DRN 3, in particular 952–60.  29 Moreover, Ovid has good company among Latin authors who give animals anthropomorphic  emotive qualities: in Vergil’s Aeneid, the death cries of the stag killed by Iulus hit human ears as  sounds like those of a human suppliant (implori similis, 7.501–2).    </page> <page sequence="16"> 496 KRISTEN EHRHARDT  means of a borrowed list of animals. Lions, tigers and bears all appear in Ovid as  well, when Pythagoras highlights the beastliness of different kinds of animals to  show why humans should not eat meat (Met. 15.83–7):    carne ferae sedant ieiunia, nec tamen omnes;  quippe equus et pecudes armentaque gramine uiuunt;  at quibus ingenium est inmansuetumque ferumque,          Armeniae tigres iracundique leones  cumque lupis ursi, dapibus cum sanguine gaudent.    Wild beasts calm hunger with meat, though not all of them.  Naturally, horses, flocks and herds live on grasses, but for those  whose nature is both savage and fierce—Armenian tigresses, furious  lions, bears and wolves—these rejoice in banquets of blood.    Juvenal, who has relied on appeals to common sense in his argument throughout  the satire, makes the provocative claim that beasts live in peace with other beasts,  in contrast to warmongering humans. On its face, this seems to contradict Ovid’s  characterization of the same animals who “rejoice in banquets of blood” (dapibus  cum sanguine gaudent, 15.87). This claim comes from a reading of the Ovidian  parallel that is misleading in two ways. First, by recalling Ovid both through his  allusion to similar animals and the Pythagorean context, Juvenal reverses the  characteristics of Ovid’s ferae ultimately accusing humanity of the beastliest  behavior. Secondly, Juvenal uses the similarity between the situations but  changes Pythagoras’ ethical conclusion (that it is wrong to eat meat) to his own,  namely that all animals are peace-loving, while humanity is marked by bloodlust  and acrimony.   By the end of the satire, our common sense is reeling: how can we trust the  satirist? He asks questions in a manner that resembles truth, but still, this is satire,  and this narratorial authority needs to be questioned. Do we know whether lions  and tigers and bears treat each other with kindness? In this case, his allusions do  not provide the proof that leads us to the same answer he seems to assume.  The statements are overtly illogical and hyperbolic, a parody of an Ovidian  parody, perhaps.30 As the Pythagoras section, and the satire itself draws to a close,    30 Knox (1986) 73 allows the possibility of humor in Ovid’s Pythagoras, noting that portrayals of  the vegetarian philosopher as “an attractive target for the type of ridicule formerly heaped on  sophists” began with Middle Comedy. Nevertheless, he does not advocate for a strictly parodic  reading.    </page> <page sequence="17">  CANNIBALIZING OVID 497      Juvenal turns to a final hypothetical question, in this case a variation on a “what- if” prompt, similar to rhetorical exercises in schools, here asking what Pythagoras  would do given the present circumstances (171–4):        quid diceret ergo  vel quo non fugeret, si nunc haec monstra uideret  Pythagoras, cunctis animalibus abstinuit qui  tamquam homine et uentri indulsit non omne legumen?    So, what would he say—or would he not run away somewhere—if  Pythagoras saw these portents, he who abstained from all animals, as  if from a human being, and who indulged his stomach not one bean?    The emphasis on the philosopher’s speech and flight once again highlight the  satire’s connection to the Pythagoras of the Metamorphoses, which begins with his  flight from Samos (sed fugerat, but he had fled, Met. 15.60) and features the  philosopher’s speech for over four hundred lines (Met. 15.75–478). Here Juvenal  reverses the original timeline, ending with the possibility of flight, likewise  reversing the Romans’ position from the audience to that of the abandoned  Samians. In his final question, our narrator seems to stop playing his own game,  no longer proposing answers he deems to be correct, but simply posing a  question. That his ultimate question is loaded with absurdity goes without  saying; this is satire: why not end with the abnegation of beans?31  By using Pythagoras as his final example, Juvenal ties together truth with the  role of the storyteller while shifting the satire back to the trope of problematic  dining. Throughout this satire, Juvenal has chosen selections from the  Metamorphoses that come from distorted feast scenes—a common trope in  Roman satire. Ovid’s centauromachy, the Erysichthon story and the final  Pythagorean soliloquy all bear a shared characteristic in the epic on the basis of  their connection to food and consumption, even if none of these stories actually  sinks to actual cannibalism.   Rather than simply reading Satire 15 as a handful of tales of cannibalism with  Ovidian seasoning, I suggest that we read the cannibalism at the core of the satire  metapoetically; that Juvenal’s preoccupation with Ovid is itself a literary    31 It may be worth noting that although Ovid’s Pythagoras goes on at length about vegetarianism  generally, his rejection of beans (a characteristic of his diet according to Aristotle, through D.L.  8.34) is never mentioned.     </page> <page sequence="18"> 498 KRISTEN EHRHARDT  cannibalism in which the satirist feeds upon another’s text and regurgitates the  crumbs in his own work. Juvenal extends this textual rehashing not only to  allusions themselves, but also by mimicking Ovid’s use of tenuous intertextual  quotations within the Metamorphoses. Whether we read this satire as in  competition with epic or forsaking it entirely, Juvenal’s penultimate work clearly  embraces the higher genre, though it is unclear if it is a gesture of love or a way to  hold it down while chomping on its guts.
