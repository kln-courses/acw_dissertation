<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ILARIA MARCHESI Traces of a Freed Language: Horace, Petronius, and the Rhetoric of Fable This paper investigates the status that the genre of fable acquires when it is employed in literature. In particular, it surveys Horace’s treatment of fables in the Satires and Epistles and the carefully controlled circumstances in which zoomorphic language is allowed to emerge during the banquet at Trimalchio’s in Petronius’ Satyrica. The analysis of the distribution of fables in Horace shows that for the Roman literary public the act of speaking through fables bore in itself a negative connotation, so much that the moral discourse of the satirist needed at Wrst to provide additional justiWcation in order to incorporate them: from vindication of ingenuitas and shifts in narrative voice, to use of rhetorical misnomers and eventually of philosophical frankness. Petronius’ text, in turn, suggests that what is wrong with fable is precisely its being reminiscent of a servile past. During the dinner at Trimalchio’s allusions to recognizable fable plots and zoomorphic language are allowed to surface only during a momentary absence of the host. This circumstance suggests that fable is not just another literary genre among the many abused in Trimalchio’s house: for both the host and his freedmen guests fables are an uncomfortable reminder of an enduring past inscribed in their language. A curious circumstance links the two most important writers of fables of antiquity, Aesop and Phaedrus: both had been slaves. Herodotus tells us that Aesop had been a Phrygian slave in Samos 1, and the principal manuscript in which Phaedrus’ fables have come down to us presents him as a freedman of the emperor Augustus 2. In the case of fables, the pre-history of the genre seems to go I wish to thank here Ellen Finkelpearl and the anonymous readers of Classical Antiquity for the valuable suggestions with which they have improved my argument. For their collegial and encouraging comments, my warmest thanks go also to the organizers and the participants of the conference Seeing Slaves in Ancient Rome (Berkeley 2002), where the preliminary results of this research were presented. 1.

According to Phaedrus fable originated as a coded language among slaves 3, , who used it to circulate subversive messages that might have put them at risk of retaliation by their owners 4. In the following pages, I will look at what happens when animals talk outside the conWnes of fable; in particular, when fable material is transported into the new context of Satire. My contention is that fable, insofar as it connects animal characters and human behaviors, performs as a freed genre—that is, it situates itself in the same ambiguous cultural space deWned by the intersection of freedom and servitude in which Roman society located the freedmen. While it claims independence from its servile past, the strategies through which fable proves its new status preserve traces of the past it purports to hide. My focus will be on two mutually reinforcing cases: Wrst, I will survey the evolution of Horace’s treatment of fables in the Satires and Epistles, the two works in his corpus in which the presence of fabulistic material is most evident; second, I will consider the carefully controlled circumstances in which zoomorphic language is allowed to emerge during the banquet at Trimalchio s in Petronius Satyrica 5’ ’ . In both case studies, I will show that Horace’s and Petronius’ treatment of fable material supports Phaedrus’ genealogy of the genre. The complicated way in which fabulistic material is introduced into their texts suggests that something of its past has clung to fable and that some measure of uneasiness accompanies the language of fable in its literary peregrinations. The same ambiguous “proximity 3. Phaed. 3. Prol.33–37: Nunc, fabularum cur sit inventum genus, / brevi docebo. Servitus obnoxia, / quia quae volebat non audebat dicere, / affectus proprios in fabellas transtulit, / calum- niamque fictis elusit iocis. Phaedrus was not totally misleading when he traced the genealogy for the genre he chose to develop. For him to claim such a pedigree, the encoding of a message about human societal life in zoomorphic language must have retained an association with a discourse in which one could still detect the problematic traces of the self-perception of slaves. Cf. Fitzgerald 2000: 99–101. This ambiguity at the core of the literary redeployment of the language goes beyond the fable’s alleged original function of conveying coded, subversive messages. 4. Accepting Daube’s explanation of two of the fables as Wtting the context of servile protest (Phaed. 1.15 as “incitement to disloyalty” and App. Per. 17 as “recommendation of deceitfulness” [Daube 1972: 53–55]), Bradley attempts to explain other fables “along the lines of servile protest or statement.” He reads Phaed. 1.6 (Frogs at the Sun’s Wedding), 1.8 (Wolf and Crane), 1.28 (Eagle and Fox), 2.8 (Stag in the Ox-Stall), 3.7 (Wolf and Dog), 4.4 (Boar, Horse, and Man), and 5.10 (Aging Dog) in this light, not so much to prove that fable had servile origin, but rather to show the applicability to slaves’ circumstances of such plots. In the end, he supports the view that “fables were at least inXuenced by forms of slave protest-statement” (Bradley 1984: 150–53). For the pervasive cultural association of the slave with the animal in the Graeco-Roman world, see Bradley 2000. Bradley’s reconstruction of the social and economic practices (and power relations) that shaped the discourse on slaves in antiquity focuses on Apuleius’ Metamorphoses and oVers a case of literary reXection of/on the dominant discourse. Bloomer 1997 lists Wve ways in which Phaedrus’ work is marked as servile or libertine: the common servile genus that Aesop and Phaedrus practiced, the work’s title specifying Phaedrus as freedman, the social status of the addressees of prologues and epilogues, the portrayal (usually negative) of freedmen in the poems, and Wnally the alleged victimization of the author based on a “lack of credit granted his voice” (75). For further bibliography, see Holzberg 1991: 232, to which one may add Hopkins 1993: 10–26 (on the Life of Aesop). 5. With the tag “zoomorphic language” I indicate the use of metaphors drawn from animal life to describe purely human circumstances. </page> <page sequence="3"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 309 and symbiosis” that Fitzgerald considers essential to the master–slave relationship aVects the encroaching of fable on other literary genres 6. In particular, the analysis of the distribution of fables in Horace will show that for the Roman literary public the act of speaking through fables bore in itself a negative connotation, so much that the moral discourse of the satirist needed at Wrst to provide additional justiWcation in order to incorporate them. Through the Wrst two books of Satires and the Wrst book of Epistles, to the systematic increase of the satirist’s conWdence in his voice there is a corresponding progressive decrease in the degree of mediation necessary to incorporate fable. Leaving behind the rhetorical motivation and the voice-displacements which characterized Satires 1 and Satires 2 respectively, Horace the epistolographer delivers several full-Xedged recitations of fables in his own voice. A brief review of Petronius’ text will, in turn, suggest that what was wrong with fable was precisely its being reminiscent of a servile past. The carefully delimited circumstances in which zoomorphic language and allusions to recognizable fable plots are allowed to surface during the dinner at Trimalchio’s show that fable is not just another literary genre among the many genres abused in the freedman’s house: for both the host and his freedmen guests fables are an uncomfortable reminder of an enduring past inscribed in their language. Likewise, for both the author and his readers, the same fables work as one of the ambiguous markers through which they articulate their identity as freeborn 7. Before turning to an analysis of the relevant texts from Horace’s Satires and Epistles, let me provide a twofold rationale for delimiting the Weld of my study to these two collections alone and for grouping them under the common heading of Satire. First, from a philological point of view, satiric poetry appears to be the only space into which Horace allows any allusions to fables to surface 8. Second, in keeping with the scholiastic tradition accompanying Horace’s collections, I consider Sermones and Epistles as part of one and the same project on which Horace worked in diVerent stages but in an essential continuity of genre 9. Seeing 6. See Fitzgerald 2000: 13–31 and 69–86. 7. An analogous argument is developed for Plautine comedy in McCarthy 2000: 1–29. 8. See the table of distribution in Warmuth 1992 and the Index Locorum in Adrados 2003, s.v. “Horace,” with commentary in Adrados 1994: 144–47. A brief overview can be found also in Della Corte 1986. In my study, I will consider only fable plots in which animals feature in anthropomorphic roles: I will not discuss the two fables featuring Prometheus in Sat. 2.3.298–99 (dixerit insanum qui me, totidem audiet atque / respicere ignoto discet pendentia tergo; The Two Wallets: Aes. 366) and in Carm. 1.16.13–16 (Fertur Prometheus addere principi / limo coactus particulam undique / desectam et insani leonis / vim stomacho apposuisse nostro; Prometheus and Men: Aes. 240). They lack the essential connection of animals to slaves that makes the fable a sensitive genre. 9. See the compelling arguments laid out by Hendrickson 1897, who identiWes in satirae a generic, cumulative designation of Horace’s poetry in hexameters and considers Sermones and Epistles the individual titles of the collections. For the sense of continuity linking the two collections, see also Freudenburg 1993: 28–29 on Sat. 1.3 and Ep. 1.1: in his view, in the Epistles Horace “uses fables and maxims just as the satirist of the diatribes” (29). Most recently, and forcefully, Braund 1996. For a complementary argument, stressing speciWc diVerences and evolution rather than generic </page> <page sequence="4"> 310 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 Horace’s hexametric poetry as all belonging to the same genre of Satire also allows me to test my hypotheses on a homogeneous literary text such as Petronius’ Satyrica 10. *** The Wrst brief treatment of fable in Horace’s works can be found in Sat. 1 6 11. . The poem opens with Horace’s praise of Maecenas for not caring who a man’s father is, provided he meets the condition of free birth (Sat. 1.6.7–8: Cum referre negas quali sit quisque parente/ natus dum ingenuus) 12, . Horace’s autobiographical association with a servile family past is couched in an argument about his patron’s ability to distinguish personal talent from familial background when making friends, and thus to recognize the practical wisdom of a poet content with a simple life and immune from political ambition 13. The mention of a servile family history is at the same time the point in which the voice of the satirist poet association, see Mayer 1994: 2–5. A minimal consensus has been reached about the dating of the two collections: the Sermones are assigned to the thirties (only a few before 38, none later than 30), the Epistles follow the ten-year phase of Horace’s work on the Odes (the Wrst three books of which were published in 23) and were probably released around 21. 10. For a moral and political reading that emphasizes the “satyrical aim” of Phaedrus’ Fables, see Bla ̈nsdorf 2000: 120–29. For the literary genealogy (Ennius, Lucilius, Horace) constructed in Roman Satire through the use of fables, see Della Corte 1986: 87–88 and Cozzoli 1995: 187–95. For a survey of fable material in Roman poetry, see the brief list in Holzberg 2002: 32–33 and the Index Locorum in Adrados 2003. There is no trace of animal fable in elegiac, epic and didactic poetry. The only author who provides one example of animal fable outside of Satire is Martial 10.79, an epigram which is most likely targeting a freedman (see Lott 2004 for the notion that the oYce of magister vici was overwhelmingly held by ex-slaves), and alludes to Horace Sat. 2.3.307–20. 11. Contrary to what Holzberg argues (2002: 32), Horace alludes to fables well before Sat. 2.1.64. One might propose to see the Wrst occurrence of fable material in Horace’s Satires in Sat. 1.1.32–35 (sicut / parvola, ut exemplo est, magni formica laboris / ore trahit quodcumque potest atque addit acervo / quem struit, haud ignara ac non incauta futuri). But the association of laboriousness with ants is proverbial (cf. Brown 1993 ad loc., citing Vergil G. 1.186 and 4.149–218; Della Corte 1986: 88 leaves the question open). Second, the text of the satire carefully distinguishes the exemplum of the provident ant from the fabula of Tantalus alluded to in 1.1.69–70 (mutato nomine de te / fabula narratur). Highet 1973: 275 fails to recognize Horace’s distinction, referring the term fabula to the story of the ant. 12. For Gordon Williams Satire 1.6 ironically incorporates the compromising language of libertino patre natus as a sneering and unfounded jest hurled at Horace by others (Williams 1995: 309–11). Armstrong 1989: 9–12 and Anderson 1995 advance the possibility that Horace’s father was not born into slavery but was enslaved after the Social Wars. Whether or not the charge of a servile background was true is irrelevant to the present argument. If true, the anxiety associated with the language of fable would be preventively discharged through the frankness of Horace’s admission. If false, Horace could be seen as ironically prolonging the joke: you say my father had been a slave, so this is how someone who comes from that background talks, through fables. For a discussion of the moral and political implications of the term ingenuus (“noble in nature,” “freeborn”), see Rudd 1982: 36–40. On the connection with Augustan contemporary politics established through the dichotomy between libertino patre natus and ingenuus in Sat. 1.6, see DuQuesnay 1984: 43–47. On the literary pedigree of Horace’s related claims of low birth and poverty, which go back to Bion of Borysthenes, see Freudenburg 1993: 205. 13. [Nec], ut plerique solent, naso suspendis adunco / ignotos, ut me libertino patre natum (Sat. 1.6.5–6). The same note is struck again at the next transition in the argument: Nunc ad me redeo libertino patre natum, / quem rodunt omnes libertino patre natum (Sat. 1.6.45–46). </page> <page sequence="5"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 311 most clearly and most strongly disassociates his poetic persona from that past: Horace freely admits that he is non ingenuo patre natus, but his friendship with Maecenas testiWes that he is himself ingenuus. Thanks to Maecenas, the poet’s familial past does not extend into his present: no father–son continuity is allowed to be constructed on this point. Because of the social status of his freedman father, Horace concedes, the censor would rightly strike him oV the role of the senators, but Maecenas knows better. The passage that most strongly articulates the distinction between personal worth and ancestry also carries the Wrst open association of slavery and fable: Namque esto, populus Laevino mallet honorem quam Decio mandare novo, censorque moveret Appius, ingenuo si non essem patre natus: vel merito, quoniam in propria non pelle quiessem. Sat. 1.6.19–22 For let us grant that the people would rather give oYce to a Laevinus than to a Decius, a homo novus, and that the censor Appius would ban me from the senate as not of a free-born father—and rightly so, for I would prove unable to remain content in my own skin 14. The attack that Horace preemptively deXects is couched in language that evokes Aesopic material in the reference to remaining content in one s own skin 15“ ’ .” The fable usually employed to gloss this line is the story of the ass who puts on the lion’s skin, and goes around terrifying the other animals, but is Wnally exposed and ridiculed by the fox who recognizes his voice 16. A second possible candidate might be the fable of the ram who puts on the skin of a dog and scares oV a wolf, until a rip in his disguise reveals who he really is and brings about his death 17. More striking than the target of allusion, however, is the coincidence of the language of fable with the Wrst reference to Horace’s background. In the same breath as he acknowledges his father’s servile origin, Horace asserts his own free birth and thus underwrites Maecenas’ stringent restriction on his appreciation of 14. All translations, unless otherwise indicated, are mine. 15. Line 22, vel merito, quoniam in propria non pelle quiessem, is structured around a strident contradiction, joining a didactic-elegiac Wrst half (merito quoniam) common to Lucretius (5.822; 6.548) and Propertius (1.17.1) with animal language pointing in the direction of fable. Horace often uses the noun pellis to mean “animal hide” rather than “human skin.” See, for instance, in the same satire, line 28 (nigris pellibus: protective garment for the legs); also Carm. 2.20.10 (the poetic metamorphosis of the “son of poor parents” into a swan), Epod. 17.15 (Ulysses’ metamorphosized companions shedding their hides), and Ep. 1.2.66 (deerskin used as a training tool for hunting dogs). 16. Aes. 358 (=Perry 1965: App. 188; Babrius 139). The reference to Aesopic material, found already in Renaissance commentaries (Landino in Urb. Lat. 357 ad loc.: est tractum ab apologo Aesopi in quo asinus leonis pellem sibi sumit) and repeated in modern editions (e.g., Brown 1993 ad loc.; Morris 1911: 100), has occasionally been challenged: Porphyry, for instance, appears to take the expression more as proverbial (see discussion in Warmuth 1992: 116–18, with reference to Otto 1890: 272). 17.

The linear force of Horace’s statement is balanced, however, by its deployment as a defense mechanism. The potential accusation brings about the necessity to counteract, with the utmost clarity and rhetorical force, any personal association with a servile past; from the rhetorical Weld of tension thus created, oblique as it may be, the Wrst allusion to fable arises. This is the only passage in Book 1 in which fable-related material appears. The mere mention of a freedman father does not suYce to set the stage for a full-Xedged use of the Aesopic tradition, and Horace’s poetic diatribe functions well without it. It is only in the second book of Satires that new fable plots become conspicuous and animals begin to speak louder and at greater length. The increased presence of fables here is accompanied by a new strategy of distancing. In Book 2 Horace dissociates himself from fable by entrusting it to the voice of other speakers 18. In Satires 3 and 6, the voices of Damasippus (twice) and Cervius host probable allusions to and extensive rewritings of Aesopic material 19, and Satire 5 alludes to the fable of the crow who loses the piece of cheese he holds in his beak through the Wlter of a second voice in the text, Tiresias. I will not go into a detailed analysis of the largest and best-studied rewriting of the Aesopic antecedent, the fable of the country-mouse and city-mouse, because the only distancing mechanism present in Satire 2.6 is the shifting of the voice to Cervius which it shares with 2 3 and 2 5 20, . . . Rather, I want to focus on the short passages in which the same dynamics of evocation and distancing we witnessed in Satire 1.6 recur. In Satire 2.3, Damasippus lectures Horace’s persona on folly as the most common failing among humans. In pointing out the absurdity of squandering wealth in order to gain public applause, a principle he has learned from the Stoic Stertinius (the third voice encapsulated in the text), Horace makes use of a metaphor that aligns the political ambition of a parvenu with the ineVective and inessential pretense of the fox who imitates the lion: 18. For the dialogism dominating the rhetorical surface of the second book, see Freudenburg 1996 and Oliensis 1998: 51–53. See also Freudenburg 2001: 71–74 on the novelty that the dialogic structure of the book represents for the readers of Book 1 and the shock of encountering so abruptly a second speaker in Sat. 2.1.5. On the peculiarity of the second book as more interested in recalling the Menippean tradition of dialogue, see Knoche 1975: 86–88. 19. Sat. 2.3.186 (probably the fox as provisional king of animals), 2.3.314–20 (the frog and the ox), and 2.6.79–117 (the city and the country mouse). 20. Notably, the fact that Sat. 2.6 shifts to the voice of Cervius only for the speciWc purpose of telling a fable suggests that the insertion of a second speaker into the text has something to do with the genre of the inset, i.e., fable. Classical readings of 2.6 can be found in Brink 1965 and West 1974. More recently, see Holzberg 1991: 235–38 (on the relationship between Horace’s retelling and the traditional arrangement of the fable), Cucchiarelli 2001: 162–68 (on peculiarly Horatian details in the fable), and Knorr 2004: 212–14 (the fable as an example of Horatian self-parody). For an emphasis on metapoetic language in the satire, see Corte ́s Trovar 1991: 75–78 and Fedeli 1993: 51–52. </page> <page sequence="7"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 313 In cicere atque faba bona tu perdasque lupinis, [. . .] scilicet ut plausus, quos fert Agrippa, feras tu, astuta ingenuum volpes imitata leonem. Sat. 2.3.182, 185–86 Would you want to waste your wealth on vetches, beans, and lupines . . . so that you might win the applause Agrippa wins—a cunning fox mimicking the noble lion? Line 186 probably points to the fable of the fox whom Zeus temporarily makes the king of animals but who is unable to shed his old despicable habits 21, . The juxtaposition of the lion and Agrippa, who achieved real popularity through his program of public building in Rome, brings to the surface the keyword ingenuus. In the present context, to be sure, the adjective means noble, generous, but the primary meaning of freeborn remains implicit. Just as in Sat. 1.6 so also in 2.3 the discourse that passes through fable is accompanied by ambiguous language that recalls and distances the memory of slavery. In 1.6 the recollection of his freedman father was the occasion for an allusion to fable; in 2.3 the allusion to fable displays a key word from the charged lexicon of slavery. Fables are haunted by the lexical memory of their past 22. Elsewhere in Satire 2.3 Damasippus inserts a second, more extended, account of an Aesopic fable found with a diVerent thrust and ending also in Phaedrus:23, , , Absentis ranae pullis vituli pede pressis, unus ubi eVugit, matri denarrat, ut ingens belua cognatos eliserit: illa rogare, quantane? num tantum, suZans se, magna fuisset? “Maior dimidio.” “num tanto?” cum magis atque se magis inXaret, “non, si te ruperis,” inquit, “par eris.” Haec a te non multum abludit imago. Sat. 2.3.314–20 During the absence of their mother, all but one of the frog’s brood were crushed under the hoof of a calf. The one who escaped tells his mother how a huge beast has wiped out his brothers; she asks “how big was the beast?” and, puYng herself out, “as big as this?” “Bigger by half.” “Then perhaps this big?” as she inXates herself more and more. “Not even if 21. The plot is summarized in Perry 1965: App. 107.

Muecke explains the reference as a proverb, on the basis of Otto 1890: 189 and Horsfall 1989: 83 n.73. See the extended commentary in Warmuth 1992: 18–28. 22. For the charged lexicon of 2.3, see Warmuth 1992: 132–33 on Horace as Damasippus’ conservus in line 80 and three allusions to the poet as animal in lines 20, 70, and 93–95. 23.

The passage is of particular interest because of the way it is grafted onto the speaker’s argument. The point that the self-appointed philosopher is making at this juncture is that the satirist is guilty of social hybris. His folly consists in striving to imitate Maecenas in Welds in which he evidently cannot compete. Maecenas builds, and Horace is a fool in his passion for building. Whereas Horace’s friend and patron is the “genuine article,” the poet’s eVort to imitate him is ridiculous and potentially fatal. Damasippus draws his listener’s attention to how well this fable applies to Horace’s condition: haec a te non multum abludit imago. The point is well taken: indeed, the parallel pairs of the poet-frog and Maecenas-ox Wt the situation. The animal and the man reach a maximum of proximity and no Wlter is necessary. The technical language that Damasippus employs, however, introduces a complication. The word imago is not merely “image” or “picture” (as the common translation has it), but the Latin technical equivalent of the Greek term παραβολ , that is simile 24, “ .” The fable might Wt Horace’s situation, but the label Damasippus attaches to it is not immediately appropriate. If we read the passage of Aristotle’s Rhetoric devoted to the rhetorical use of the example, we notice that the term παραβολ  is not the right rhetorical category to describe what Damasippus has just used to expose the poet’s own folly: παραδειγμτων δà εÒδη δupsilonacuteο: ëν μàν γρ âστιν παραδεÐγματο̋ εÚδο̋ τä λèγειν πργματα προγεγενημèνα, ëν δà τä αupsilonlenisτäν ποιεØν. τοupsilonacuteτου δà ëν μàν παραβολ ëν δà λìγοι, οÙον οÉ ΑÊσ ̧πειοι καÈ ΛιβυκοÐ. 2.20.2–3. 1393a28–30 There are two kinds of examples: one kind is the narration of preceding events, the other inventing them oneself. Of the latter one is simile, the other fables, like those of Aesop and the Libyan tales. It is clear that the appropriate term for Damasippus’ Aesopic tale would be λìγο̋, that is to say fabula, fable, not imago, which is παραβολ , simile. Damasippus’ argument thus relies on a miscategorization that counteracts any immediate association 25. His fable can be applied to the poet only because it is 24. The Latin rhetorical tradition registers several possible translations for the term (Cicero de Orat. 2.265 and 356): at an early stage of his career as theorist of oratory, Cicero rendered παραβολ  with collatio (Inv. 1.30, but also Fin. 4.27.75), but elsewhere we Wnd the alternatives similitudo (Quintilian Inst. 5.11.23), and imago (Rhet. Her. 4.62). Quintilian latinizes the Greek in Inst. 6.3.59 and 8.3.77; Horace follows the strong Latin translation. 25. That imago is a technical term intended to represent parabola is attested by the glosses to the line. Cf. Porphyry at Sat. 2.3.320: “ranae” a te non multum abludit imago: non a te discrepat parabola. Aristotle’s two-step distinction facilitates the miscategorization: fabula and imago are grouped under the heading of narratives “made up to suit the occasion.” For the distinction between λìγοι and μupsilonperispomeneθο̋, both falling under the complementary heading of fabula, see Cope 1970: 105–107. </page> <page sequence="9"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 315 not called a fable. The same terminological shift can be detected in Sat. 2.5, in the dialogue ensuing from Tiresias’ lecture to the shrewd Ulysses on the craft of legacy hunting: “Qui testamentum tradet tibi cumque legendum, [. . .] solus multisne coheres, veloci percurre oculo. plerumque recoctus scriba ex quinqueviro corvum deludet hiantem, captatorque dabit risus Nasica Corano.” Num furis? an prudens ludis me obscura canendo? “O Lae ̈rtiade, quidquid dicam, aut erit aut non: divinare etenim magnus mihi donat Apollo.” Quid tamen ista velit sibi fabula, si licet, ede. Sat. 2.5.51; 54–60 [Tir.] Someone, let’s suppose, gives you his will to read, . . . scan it fast with your eye and check whether you are the sole heir or co-heir with many. Often enough a scribe, recooked from a civil servant, will fool the gaping raven, and Nasica, the legacy-hunter, will give Coranus a chance for a good laugh. [Uly.] Are you mad? Or do you slyly make fun of me with your dark prophecy? [Tir.] O son of Laertes, all I say will or will not come to pass; for the great Apollo grants me this gift. [Uly.] All right, then tell me, please, what this fabula means. At this point one expects Tiresias to explain his brief allusion to the fable of the crow and the fox, since Ulysses’ query about the meaning of the story (fabula), after an Aesopic fable has been evoked, suggests this as the most natural point of reference 26. Instead, Tiresias goes on to explain the παραβολ  contained in his oracular utterance. The next eight lines show how the situation of Nasica and Coranus applies to the predicament of the legacy-hunter cheated out of his reward. To an inquiry about the meaning of a fabula Horace’s text thus answers with the explanation of what to Ulysses appears as a παραβολ  (and is, in fact, for the extradiegetic audience, an historia). The crow evoked in the animal metaphor for the legacy-hunter and in the language of Ulysses’ question remains unexplained and silent 27. 26. For Rudd, who overlooks the terminological pun, “Ulysses presses for information about Nasica and Coranus” (1982: 230). Ulysses’ question may be no less ambiguous than the oracular response of the seer; still, the primary referent of the technical term he employs is the fable of the crow and the cheese, rather than the story of a marriage contract in Rome’s recent past. 27. The development of the satire sidetracks the fable by casting the real present in the form of a prophesied future rather than the atemporal present of Aesopic stories. The fabula referred to is diYcult to pinpoint: Rudd, again, doubts the immediate identiWcation with the fable of the raven cheated out of a piece of cheese (1982: 233). Muecke disagrees as well, mentioning as more pertinent for the context Lucian Tim. 22, DMort. 16(6).3. </page> <page sequence="10"> 316 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 As will become clear in my discussion of Trimalchio’s dinner, the reason for these complementary shifts in terminology, which make the word fabula a diYcult Wt for the context in which an actual fable is told, is the servile connotations of the genre: the term “fable” is too appropriate a label for what the texts suggest. In addition to always making diVerent speakers responsible for referring to fables Horace also unsettles their rhetorical vocabulary. The poet’s use of misnomers contributes to distancing the voice of his Satires from a servile past 28. Allusions to fable material, then, appear only in speciWc contexts, emerge only in a qualiWed and localized manner, and their vocabulary is misappropriated. The mix of voices peculiar to Horace’s second book of Satires (a mix into which slaves and freeborn are allowed to appear) opens up the text to the language of fable. The oblique, dialogic nature of the satirical voice works as a Wlter that allows the charged idiom to permeate. Other speakers beyond the authorial voice share the work of the satirist; indeed, they become the primary voices responsible for the emergence of fables. Through its polyphony Horace’s text becomes receptive to an alien but familiar discourse: the authorial persona is at once partially drawn into and distanced from it. The mechanisms of incorporation just described are reversed when we come to the second collection of Horace’s hexametric poetry, the Epistles. The rhetorical strategies, systematic distancing, and terminological shifts by which the poet had insinuated the language of fable into his Satires evolve into a wholesale, unmediated incorporation of fabulistic material into the epistolary argument. The zoomorphic language associated with fable becomes part and parcel of the authorial voice: the speaker of the Satires has now internalized the voice of the lecturing speakers constructed in his earlier texts. In the Wrst collection, Horace’s servile familial past was introduced indirectly through the Wgure of his freedman father only to be dismissed. Only then did fable begin to surface, and only in mediated form, through the voices of the dialoguing protagonists. In the Epistles, Horace’s direct association with slavery is asserted from the beginning; this gesture allows fable to come immediately into play, and the voice of the author is directly responsible for employing zoomorphic language. Horace’s text, however, balances the impact of the opening frank association of the authorial voice with slavery by turning the familial link he had acknowl- edged in Sat. 1.6 into a purely metaphoric connection: he talks about himself as if he were a slave. It is only in the last poem of the collection that the recitation of the tag libertino patre natus (Ep. 1.20.20) reiterates the signal which had opened the poetic space available to fable. With the return of this tag the cycle 28. The closeness of fable to simile (facilitated perhaps by the initial dichotomy in Aristotle) is attested also in Phaedrus, who labels his fable fur et lucerna (4.11.14) an argumentum (in the rhetorical tradition, another equivalent of παραβολ ). The shift may have been traditional for fable writers: also Ennius perhaps labeled his fable about the crested lark an argumentum (see Knoche 1975: 23–24). On the internal dialectics in Phaedrus between beast fables proper and non-Aesopic material imported into the Latin collection, see Henderson 1999: 317–18. </page> <page sequence="11"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 317 of allusions to fable is rounded oV. Once again the allusion is connected, this time retrospectively with Horace s original social status 29, ’ . Slavery Wgures prominently from the beginning of the new book. The gladia- torial metaphor which opens the Epistles has shock value 30. Its force is conWrmed by the familiar association of slavery with the language of the fable. Horace metaphorically introduces his new poetic persona as a slave, an old gladiator who has already won his freedom, and immediately recurs to a characterization drawn from the animal world, an old, soon-to-be-retired, horse: Prima dicte mihi, summa dicende Camena, spectatum satis et donatum iam rude quaeris, Maecenas, iterum antiquo me includere ludo. non eadem est aetas, non mens. [. . .] est mihi purgatam crebro qui personet aurem: “solve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne peccet ad extremum ridendus et ilia ducat.” Ep. 1.1.1–4; 7–9 You, of whom my Wrst poetry has told, of whom my last shall tell—you Maecenas, now want to lock me up again in my old school, as a gladiator who has been proven in enough Wghts and has already been discharged. But neither my age nor my spirits are the same as then. [. . .] I have a voice that keeps ringing in my well-rinsed ear: “Free the ageing horse while you are still in time, lest he stumble close to the Wnish and laughably break wind.” It is no surprise, then, that the same epistle contains the most widely recognized allusion to fable, that of the aged lion and the fox. The fable emerges from a hypothetical dialogue of the poet with the Roman people, but this time it is the voice of Horace the character that takes responsibility for the allusion to the Aesopic plot. If his fellow citizens were to ask why Horace did not share their views as he shared their public places, he would reply with the same words the fox used with the sick lion: 29. Cum tibi sol tepidus pluris admoverit auris / me libertino natum patre . . . loqueris (Ep. 1.20.19–21). On the “program pieces” (Carm. 2.20, 3.30 and Ep. 1.20) which contain references to Horace’s alleged servile family history, see Freudenburg 1993: 206. 30. On the double metaphor of 1.1.1–9 (poet=slave=horse), see Bowditch 2001: 1–3, with a survey of previous deXating treatments of the metaphor. Other allusions to Horace’s metaphoric slavery recur in Ep. 1.10.10: utque sacerdotis fugitivus liba recuso, a disconcerting simile framed by an allusion to doves (lines 5–7), and the full-Xedged recitation of the fable of the stag, the horse, and the man (lines 34–38); in Ep. 1.14.1–5, where the dialogue with Horace’s vilicus conXates the social status of the two speakers who are joined by the same activity of “clearing the Welds and the soul from thorns” and paves the way for the animal metaphor of line 9; in Ep. 1.16.45–52, where the exemplum fictum, which Horace constructs again by joining exemplary animals (wolf, hawk, and gurnard) and the morality of the slave, compares the slavery to vice which aVects people of free birth. </page> <page sequence="12"> 318 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 Quodsi me populus Romanus forte roget, cur non ut porticibus sic iudiciis fruar isdem, nec sequar aut fugiam quae diligit ipse vel odit, olim quod vulpes aegroto cauta leoni respondit, referam “Quia me vestigia terrent, omnia te adversum spectantia, nulla retrorsum.” Ep. 1.1.70–75 But if the people of Rome were to ask me why I do not share their opinions as I share the same arcades as they, why I do not follow or avoid what they love or hate, I would answer with the same words as the cautious fox addressed to the sick lion: “Because the footprints terrify me—all leading toward you, none back.” The fable, related to Aes. 142, is found in Babrius 103 and it was no stranger to the literary tradition of satire: Lucilius had already employed it 31, and Quintilian cites Horace’s version as an example of poetic deployments of fable in Inst. 5.11.20. The fable is relevant, however, for the circumstances of its recitation more than for its implicit moral: it is central to the opening poem of the collection and it is conveyed by the voice of the author in the text 32. In this, it sets the paradigm for all further examples of the use of fables in the book. In Ep. 1.3.18–20, the authorial voice exhorts the poet Celsus to Wnd his own poetic idiom and avoid slavishly imitating other practitioners of the art through the fable of the jackdaw in the borrowed feathers (Aes 101) 33. . Similarly, in 1.7.29–33, it is through a direct comparison of himself and the fox with the swollen belly (Aes. 24) that Horace describes his situation as obliged recipient of Maecenas’ gifts 34. Finally, by going back to the fable plot Aristotle attributed to Stesichorus at Rhet. 2.20.5 (Aes. 269a), Horace points out the dangers of having happiness depend on the accumulation of goods (Ep 1 10 34 42) 35. . . – . Only one further example of fable is generally detected in the Epistles, the apologue of the ass and its driver (Aes. 186) in Ep. 1.20.14–16, to which I will return shortly. The distribution of fable material in Horace’s Epistles thus appears to be built around a discontinuity, with a heavy concentration of fables in the 31. Mayer 1994 ad loc. mentions a possible parallel also in Seneca Dial. 8.1.3. Warmuth 1992: 47–52 connects this fable with the one mentioned in Ep. 1.7.29—the fox with the swollen belly—insofar as both pertain to the theme of “desire for independence.” 32. The moral message is probably, as Mayer notes, that “following the herd irreversibly compromises independence of judgment.” 33. The text reads: ne, si forte suas repetitum venerit olim / grex avium plumas, moveat cornicula risum / furtivis nudata coloribus? Mayer (1994: 128) reads the passage as “an adaptation of the fable of the proud jackdaw and the peacock (Phaed. 1.3, cf. Babr. 72).” 34. For the polyvalence of Horace’s use of this fable (“the duplicitous speaker” targeting a double readership), see Bowditch 2001: 186–88 and 209–10. Kilpatrick 1986: 7–14 and Warmuth 1992: 28–36 insist on the autobiographic potential of the text. 35. Mayer 1994 ad loc. notes that “Phaedrus 4.4. and Aesop 238 Hausrath-Hunger are similar fables.” See also Warmuth 1992: 149–52. </page> <page sequence="13"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 319 Wrst ten epistles and a large nine-poem hiatus between Ep. 1.10 and 1.20. Two more poems, Ep. 1.13 and 1.18, however, contain previously undetected allusions to Aesopic material 36. At the end of Epistle 1.18, Horace expresses his sense of accomplishment in having learned to live a life of moderation. On this ethics of a golden mean he has based also his recently acquired independence. His simple desires now comprise a good supply of books and provisions suYcient to last the year—enough to call himself safe from the Xuctuations of fortune: . . . quid credis, amice, precari? “sit mihi quod nunc est, etiam minus, et mihi vivam quod superest aevi, siquid superesse volunt di; sit bona librorum et provisae frugis in annum copia, neu Xuitem dubiae spe pendulus horae.” Ep. 1.18.106–10 What do you think, my friend, I am praying for? “May I have in the future what I have now, or even less; may I live for myself for what is left of my life, if the gods grant that I live further; may I have an abundance of books and enough food set aside to last the year; and may I not be swung back and forth by the hope of each uncertain hour.” In the context of this ritualistic prayer, Horace’s desires are rather generic and involve only material goods (books and food). In the opening poem, on the other hand, the life the poet had chosen involved goods of a more spiritual kind. In Ep. 1.1, Horace articulated a standard preliminary recusatio designed to bring the new collection under the aegis of moral philosophy rather than poetry. Addressing the patron who allegedly is summoning him back into service, Horace claims: Nunc itaque et versus et cetera ludicra pono; quid verum atque decens curo et rogo et omnis in hoc sum; condo et compono quae mox depromere possim. Ep. 1.1.10–12 So now I let go of my verses and all other toys. I devote myself to what is true and seemly; only that I ask for, and to that alone I am wholly given. I am storing away and setting in order things which I might soon draw upon. Horace’s commitment to intellectual discipline recalls and corrects the negative image of the unceasing toil to which hoarders subject themselves in Satire 1.1. 36. Ep. 1.14 (Horace’s speech to his vilicus), too, shows potential traces of the association of slavery with fable: in line 9, where, incorporating Lucretian language (Lucr. 2.263–65; see Warmuth 1992: 155–56), Horace refers to himself as a horse that wants to break free; and in lines 43–44, as if in a concluding moralization (epimythion) for the poem, where Horace chooses ox and horse as standing for the restless desires of humans. Kilpatrick 1986: 89–93 and Highet 1973: 276–77 see the comparison as perhaps drawn from a fable. </page> <page sequence="14"> 320 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 It also evokes and reinterprets the exemplary Wgure of the ant, the proverbially industrious animal which was mentioned there. Unlike the corresponding poem in the Satires, however, the epistle contrasts the practical virtue of the poet, who is now associating himself with the ant, with the more frivolous activities of his former self: et versus et cetera ludicra pono (10). By including a reference to the alternative and discounted otium of poetry, Horace also evokes the counterex- ample of the ant, the cicada, which, in fable, is associated with the leisurely activity of song. The shift in target is signiWcant: what in the opening satire was presented as a mere exemplum becomes now an allusion to a recognizable fable plot that of Aes 373 37, . . The restraint Horace exercised in the Wrst collection is programmatically lifted in the Epistles. In Epistle 1.13 Horace entrusts his messenger Vinnius with some poems for Augustus and adds a recommendation that he behave properly in the presence of the Princeps: according to the letter, Vinnius is supposed to deliver the scrolls if he Wnds Octavian in good health and good spirits, and only if he is asked to. Any other behavior would compromise the mission by jeopardizing the reception of his poems. To this recommendation Horace adds a personal caveat: si te forte meae gravis uret sarcina chartae, abicito potius, quam quo perferre iuberis clitellas ferus impingas, Asinaeque paternum cognomen vertas in risum et fabula Was. Ep. 1.13.6–9 If perhaps the weight of my book’s burden is too much to bear, I’d rather you Xing it from you than rudely toss down your saddlebag where you are bidden to deliver it. I don’t want you to turn your father’s name of Asina into a joke, and become the talk of the town. Horace packs here a double joke into four lines. The cognomen (or probably, as Mayer suggests, agnomen) of the addressee’s father, Asina, prompts an association of the son with terms pertaining to beasts of burden (gravis sarcina, clitellas, positum onus fasciculum perhaps also ferus)38. . . , , and the nexus fabula fias, 37. On the necessary narrative character of fables, see van Dijk 1997: 113–15 and 631–32. 38. Horace’s insistence on characterizing the cognomen as paternus, hence—implicitly—not belonging to Vinnius, might have insinuated a subtler pun based on assonance. From a zoological point of view, the oVspring of an Asina and a horse is a hinny, in Latin hinnus (see Col. 6.37.5). The pun may perhaps have been acknowledged by the ultimate recipient of Ep. 1.13, Augustus himself. Suetonius cites Augustus’ witty thank-you note that contains a similar zoologic nameplay: pertulit ad me Onysius libellum tuum, quem ego ut excusantem, quantuluscumque est, boni consulo (Poet. 40.50). On the potential connection of Vinnius/Hinnus and Suetonius’ Life of Horace, see Johnson 1940: 421–22 and Smith 1951. Johnson emends the text Vinni into Hinne, perhaps unnecessarily: in the context of heightened alertness to fables, assonance is likely to be enough to trigger a pun. On speaking names in Horace, see Vogel 1918: 404–406; for humorous naming practices in Rome, see Linderski 1988–1989: 115–18 (on Varro’s De re rustica, as a satire in which “birds speak” and speakers appear bearing ornithological names). </page> <page sequence="15"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 321 literally “be ridiculed,” invites the reader to recognize the presence of an allusion to Aesopic material 39. Several elements reinforce this interpretation. The notion of an unbearable burden that lies at the core of the epistle recurs, for instance, in Aes. 286 (the ass’s burden shifted gradually to the mule) and in Phaed. 1.15 (the ass who does not care whose slave he is, as long as he carries only one pack at a time). Similarly, the idea that the animal entrusted with a burden will do anything in its power to get rid of it appears in Aes. 180 (=Babrius 111: the ass with a load of salt and then of sponges). The landscape that Vinnius has to cross in order to reach Augustus in line 10, clivos and flumina, though conventional, perhaps suggests the hurdles usually associated with the best traveled animal in fables (cf. Perry 1965: App. 186, invoked by Horace in Ep. 1.10, and Babrius 111=Aes. 180);40 the rather mysterious lamae (swamps) might recall the situation of Perry 1965: App 189: the ass and the frogs in the marsh 41. . Finally, the insistence on the materiality of the message that Vinnius is carrying brings the epistle into close contact with three details featured in a precise fable, Aes. 264: in Horace, the scrolls are carefully sealed (signata volumina, line 2); the messenger risks breaking them (cave ne . . . mandata . . . frangas, line 19); and Horace asks him to cast them aside along the way rather than to deliver them rudely (abicito potius, quam . . . ferus impingas, lines 7–8). In the Aesopic fable the ass and the dog Wnd a letter (εupsilonasperρìντε̋ . . . γραμμτιον); the ass breaks its seal (ναρρ cα̋ τν σφραγØδα) and discovers that the letter is virtually “a treatise on fodder” (as Perry puts it), and the dog tells him to throw it away (βλε κατ γ ̈̋), since what is of great interest to his fellow-traveler is of no interest to him. The self-diminishing rhetoric of the letter, introduced through the neoteric diminutive libellis in line 4, is reinforced by the fabulistic substratum: Horace’s poems are imagined as potentially holding no more appeal to Augustus than a text on fodder to a dog. A last fable appears in the closing poem of the book, where once again it is marked by servile associations: the addressee of the letter is the book itself, which is imagined as a young slave eager to leave the house of his owner and to wander the city in search of lovers. The poet/master claims for himself the role of teacher and, having warned the inexperienced slave/work about the dangers 39. Kilpatrick 1986: 14–18 summarizes the question of the addressee’s identity and the possible associations of his name with the animal kingdom; he appears, however, to endorse a diVerent (perhaps not incompatible) view of the epistle’s lexicon as centered on references to military language. As a consequence, he sees Vinnius as more likely to have been a centurion (cf. Nisbet 1959: 75–76 and McGann 1963: 258–59). Contra, Rostagni 1944 talks about Onysius and Vinnius as a slave or a freedman of Horace (118). 40. “Caballus in clivo” seems to have been a proverbial expression for overburdened eVort: see Petr. 134.2: lassus tamquam caballus in clivo et operam et sudorem perdidisti, with Baldwin 1973: 123. 41. A geographical explanation, perhaps excessively literalist, that locates the sender in Taranto because of the regional color of the word lamae, can be found in Balmori 1936. </page> <page sequence="16"> 322 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 of prostituting oneself to the public, invokes as a cautionary exemplum the fable of the ass and the driver (Aes 186): 42. ridebit monitor non exauditus, ut ille qui male parentem in rupes protrusit asellum iratus; quis enim invitum servare laboret? Ep. 1.20.14–16 I who now preach will eventually laugh if you don’t listen, like that fellow who threw his stubborn donkey oV the cliV: for who would trouble to save someone against his will? With this last fable, the voice of the author involves itself once again in an Aesopic narrative. Horace the poet is the monitor in two senses: he is the teacher who uses fable to instruct the book/slave and the driver who acts his part in the fable itself. A slight shift in characterization reinforces Horace’s involvement in the plot: whereas in Aesop the moral fault seemed to be placed exclusively on the obstinate ethos of the ass, recalcitrant and litigious to the point of self-destruction, Horace’s version takes as its secondary point of reference the ethos of the driver, typiWed by the nexus ille . . . iratus, who seems to share responsibility for the animal’s demise. By redistributing the blame across the entire cast of the fable, the sphragis poem permanently connects the authorial voice with the narrative. In a few lines, Horace will explicitly remind his readers of his indirect, familial association with slavery by identifying himself as libertino natus patre (20); the fable he has just recited, however, had already connected his voice to the world of the slave. From my survey of Horace’s hexametric poetry a precise line of tendency has progressively become apparent: the authorial voice treats the narrative material associated with fable in an increasingly unmediated fashion. Evoked initially only obliquely in the Wrst book of Sermones, then displaced onto other speakers of servile status in the polyphony of the second book, and Wnally embraced as the idiom most Wtting his satirical discourse in the Epistles, the language of fable appears to accompany Horace’s growing conWdence in his position as a self- appointed moralist poet. As the personal stigma receded into the past, the process of Horace’s poetic self-fashioning could dismiss it and incorporate the charged language of fables into his authorial identity. * * * In traditional treatments of Horace’s use of fable, it has been noted that one can also Wnd allusions to subject matters allegedly reminiscent of Aesopian plots 42. Double entendres abound: Mayer 1994 notes line 2, prostes and the nexus pumice mundus (as applying to the Wnished book for sale and to the young slave trying to hide his age by removing hair with an abrasive pumice stone); line 6, emisso (the “published” book and the boy “let go”); line 7, laeserit (criticism of the book and “sexual exploitation” of the boy); line 11, contrectatus (the “perused” book and the “fondled” boy); line 13, vinctus (perhaps “a parcel wrapped by the bookseller” and “a slave in chain”). </page> <page sequence="17"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 323 outside the corpus of his hexametric poetry. In my view, however, these examples are, in every case, not references to fables, but rather usages of zoomorphic language 43. The strongest candidate among potential allusions to fables is the harsh attack on the unnamed tribunus militum of Epode 4: Lupis et agnis quanta sortito obtigit, tecum mihi discordia est, Hibericis peruste funibus latus et crura dura compede. Epod. 4.1–4 Between you and me there is as much enmity as fate has allotted to wolves and lambs—you whose back has been burned by the Spanish whip, and whose legs have grown hard from being shackled 44. Even in this case, the reference to wolves and lambs is not suYcient to evoke a speciWc fable plot 45. The example allows one, however, to detect an important gradation in the use of fable and zoomorphic language characteristic of both Horace and Petronius. In Epod. 4, Horace refers to the proverbial enmity between two species as part of an invective against a freedman who has climbed the social ladder during the unrest of the civil wars. The rebuke of a freedman by one who is only “the son of a freedman” functions as a literary marker for a social gap: if it is only the association of full-Xedged fable and slavery that disturbs the fabric of Horace’s literary texts, for the freedman the simple deployment of zoomorphic language in a literary insult is enough to unsettle his public image. The poetic persona of Horace, involved only indirectly with slavery, substantially diVers in its relation to animal language from the character he attacks in his poem. The consideration of how other literary freedmen, those depicted by Petronius, react 43. Cf. Carm. 4.4.50–52 (cervi, luporum praeda rapacium, / sectamur ultro, quos opimus / fal- lere et effugere est triumphus) and Epod. 12.25–26 (O ego non felix, quam tu fugis, ut pavet acris / agna lupos capreaeque leones). The case of Carm. 4.13.25 (sed . . . fata . . . servatura diu parem / cornicis vetulae temporibus Lycen) is more complicated for its connection to App. Perr. 26, The Crow and the Sheep. The epimythion of the crow in the fable (ideo senectam mille in annos prorogo) might explain Horace’s joke on Lyce’s age. The reference, however, seems to have been proverbial: see Otto 1890: 93. I am inclined to see the fable more as deriving (as a gloss) from the proverb than vice versa. The same can be said of Sat. 2.1.77–78, where Knorr 2004: 180 links the poet’s warning that “er sei nicht ganz so weich, wie er scheine” to fable plots. Though suggestive of Phaed. 4.8 for the connection established by the parallel morals, Horace’s metaphor appears to have been proverbial in origin: see, for instance, Seneca Dial. 7.20.6. 44. On the much discussed circumstances of the tirade and the probable identity of Horace’s target, see the glosses of Porphyry ad loc. Watson 2003: 145–73 (esp. 150–52) oVers a detailed social and political interpretation of the poem. 45. The zoologic reference does not necessarily involve a real fable: the enmity between wolves and lambs appeared already in Homer as a sign of unbridgeable discord (Il. 22.262V.). Warmuth 1992: 54 insists on the generalizing value of the plural (lupis and agnis versus the programmatic singular of Phaed. 1.2.1: quidam lupus et agnus). On the remarkable restraint—to the point of absence—that Horace exercises in the Epodi when it comes to using fables, which were part of the traditional iambic, Archilochean weaponry, see Adrados 1994: 134 and Cucchiarelli 2001: 175–76. </page> <page sequence="18"> 324 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 to the surfacing of zoomorphic language in conversation will conWrm that the socio-literary milieu attacked by Horace and portrayed by Petronius shared the same heightened sensibility to the negative connotations of fable. In the world of the freedmen of the Satyrica, the emergence of the language of fable is accompanied by an unwelcome recollection of the servile origins they strive to repress. Here fable can be read even more transparently as an anxiety- raising repressed memory. Unlike Horace, who could claim free birth while allowing his text to convey an argument through Aesopic fables, the host of the dinner party constructs a text (the dinner itself, its courses and conversation) that tries to dissociate the present from a servile past. Trimalchio’s despotic control of semiosis during the dinner is not, however, absolute, and unsettling memories of his past keep haunting him. Some of these memories are triggered by the use of fables and zoomorphic language. Trimalchio’s clumsy attempt to live life as a human being (homo inter homines, Petr. 57.5) rests on the claim that his previous servile condition has left no mark on him. Though not ashamed of the reality of his past, he insists on having broken free of it. By showing through caricature how excessive and misunderstood Trimalchio’s habits are, the text of Petronius systematically undoes the freedman s attempt to eVace the past 46’ . In the Cena, the language of fable functions as one of the reminders that Trimalchio’s palingenesis has largely been ineVectual. The overall dynamics of the episode supports my hypothesis that the memory of a servile past is inherent in the language of fable. It is, in fact, only after Trimalchio’s watch is momentarily suspended that zoomorphic language creeps into the conversation around his table. Indeed, as soon as Trimalchio leaves the scene, the text registers a maximum density of metaphors, proverbs, and allusions to fables prominently featuring animals 47. The abrupt intrusion is striking, and makes a signiWcant contrast with the more restrained speech of the freedmen elsewhere. In refraining from using the charged language of fable when Trimalchio is around, his guests seem to conform to an implicit house rule which is perhaps best expressed by the Italian proverb that forbids talk about ropes in the home of a suicide by hanging. Furthermore, the violence with which Trimalchio himself reacts to the insult “dog!” hurled by Fortunata at him is worth noting. It is only at this point, when he is at the peak of his rage and has lost his self-control, that even he will abandon all pretensions and deploy language and paradigms derived from fables. From the point of view of the freeborn guests, this is the moment at which all the pleasantries of the dinner lose their Xavor. The unveiling of their host’s unchanged nature evokes a direct comment from the narrator: Hinc primum 46. Bodel 1984: 111–79. 47. For zoomorphic language and social characterization, Horsfall 1989: 83 provides bibliogra- phy and lists four proverbs that presuppose an animal fable: asinus in tegulis (63.2), murem cum rana alligata (56.9), mus in matella (ibid.), inflat se tamquam rana (74.13, on which see below). </page> <page sequence="19"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 325 hilaritas nostra turbata est (Petr. 74.8). Once the Wlter is removed, and Trimalchio rejoins, through language, his servile past, the dinner party reaches its nadir. With his lapse into the language of fable, Trimalchio undermines once and for all any pretension of being what he is not, and the reality of the situation becomes too much for the guests to bear. The Wrst passage of interest appears in chapter 41. The aVectation of Trimal- chio’s despotic and autocratic control of the conversation has so far left no room for incursions into the semantic Weld of fable during the dinner. He has just per- formed an elegant reading of the Zodiac plate that links animals to constellations which has won him praise for his liberal education. It is therefore particularly meaningful that the context of the short chapter devoted to the next course, the aper pilleatus, a wild boar carrying a freedman’s cap on its head, is interwoven with allusions to the transition in status from slavery to freedom clustered around the interpretation of an animal dish. The episode functions as a prologue to the long absence of the host from the table, during which the freedmen guests will fall back on animal language and their past as slaves will resurface in their speeches. The exact meaning of the elaborate dish that Trimalchio serves as main course is unclear. Hermeros explains its symbolism in a way that satisWes the narrator, but his reading of the plate is incomplete and problematic. Indeed, certain details in the setting invite a diVerent interpretation, in which the boar becomes a locus of ambiguity and conXicting hermeneutics. The servants lay out upon the couches coverlets showing all the paraphernalia of hunting. Suddenly Spartan hounds begin dashing everywhere and following them comes a dish with a wild boar wearing a freedman’s cap. Little cakes are arranged all around to look like suckling piglets. A slave strikes the boar’s side and a Xock of thrushes Xies out. To Encolpius’ query about the signiWcance of the freedman’s cap, Hermeros replies: Plane etiam hoc servus tuus indicare potest; non enim aenigma est, sed res aperta. hic aper, cum heri summa cena eum vindicasset, a convivis dimissus &lt;est&gt;; itaque hodie tamquam libertus in convivium revertitur. Petr. 41.3–5 It’s so clear that even your slave could explain this point—it’s no enigma, but plain as day. This boar here was claimed for the last course yesterday, but the guests let it go free. So, today it returns to the feast as a freedman. Hermeros’ reading, suggestive as it may be, is partial and perhaps misleading: the piglets that accompany the boar, for example, receive no explanation, nor does he account for the complicated hunting scene that prepares, and is essential to, the coup de the ́aˆtre of the birds Xying out of the boar’s belly. The problems do not stop at this, however. If right, Hermeros’ interpretation would have Trimalchio creating and displaying a practical joke about the most important of his pretensions (that of having become a man among men). A joke conXating animal and slave via a lexical pun on libertus, and the visual pun of the pilleus, hardly Wts the characterization </page> <page sequence="20"> 326 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 of the host, who is deadly serious about the matter. If one is allowed to say that the wild boar of yesterday is now a freedman—or a freed boar—the truth of the matter is that the beast still is the same wild boar as yesterday and nothing in it has really changed. The cultural syllogism thus created threatens the inner core of Trimalchio’s value system: if the freed boar is still a boar, the freed slave is still a slave 48. But there is more. If one accepts Hermeros’ point of view, insult is the paradox at which one arrives. Hermeros’ insistence that even a slave would be able to understand the joke of the aper pilleatus, reminds us that the proximity of animal and slave would be oVensive for the host. The joke would be too transparent and would undermine the blind faith Trimalchio professes in the thaumaturgic power of manumission 49. The narrator’s question and Hermeros’ answer take place in a break in the conversation and are explicitly described as an aside: qui privatum habebam secessum (Petr. 41.1). Hermeros’ hermeneutics do not reach Trimalchio’s ears and the author of the signifying plate does not lend his authority to the interpretation. The signals that Trimalchio sends out when introducing his aper pilleatus point, instead, in a diVerent direction. The quotation from Aeneid 2 that opens the episode (Petr. 39.3) suggests an association between the deceiving craft of the Greek and the culinary inventiveness of the host. Sic notus Ulyxes?, asks Trimalchio before launching into a short eulogy on the beneWts of dinner-table philology. The quotation sets the tone for the episode: as Pepe has suggested, the aper pilleatus resembles the Trojan horse for the live birds that exit its belly, and the suckling piglets are reminiscent of the omen Aeneas is told to Wnd upon his arrival in Latium 50. Far from being an allusion to manumission, the cap would thus work as a framing signal that connects the boar to the Trojan cycle. The episode of the boar draws together in unsettling proximity animals and slaves and functions as a prologue for an extended section in which the same association is refracted through the many voices of the dinner. After the wild boar course, Trimalchio leaves the dining room and animals begin to populate the idiomatic sermo of the guests. From the bitter reference to the host as “the tyrant” and the profusion of expressions alluding to animals, we sense that with Trimalchio’s exit a tacit censorship has been lifted. The conversation of the freedmen includes metaphorical and proverbial references to Xies (minoris quam muscae sumus, 42.4), kites (mulier milvinum genus, 42.7), dogs (linguam caninam comedi, 43.3), crows (niger tamquam corvus, 43.8), lions (o si haberemus illos leones, 44.4), oxen (nunc oculum bublum vidi maiorem, 44.12), foxes and lions together (nunc populus est domi leones, foras vulpes, 44.15), mice 48. Bodel 1984: 184–85. 49. In Freudian terms, the joke allows a subversive content to be expressed while controlling it through the use of language and social conventions. When its content is too violent and inappropriate, or when the combined forces of language and conventions are unable to control it, the joke fails to elicit the complicity of the addressees and becomes a Xat-out insult. 50. Pepe 1957 passim. </page> <page sequence="21"> marchesi: Traces of a Freed Language 327 (udi tamquam mures, 44.18), pigs (modo sic, modo sic—inquit rusticus—varium porcum perdiderat, 45.2), donkeys (qui asinum non potest, stratum caedit, 45.8), kites again (ille milvo volanti poterat ungues resecare, 45.9), snakes (colubra restem non parit, 45.9), and Wnally chickens (putares eos gallos gallinaceos, 45.11). When Trimalchio returns, the conversation shifts and the animals recede from view. The host reestablishes his hold on the conversation until Fortunata abuses him with the insult “Dog!” (Canis: 74.10). Trimalchio’s rage is more than episodic. The epithet Fortunata hurls at her husband short-circuits the basic metaphoric mechanism of fable, in which animals behave like human beings. In her insult the distance between animals and humans is reduced to nothing. Trimalchio responds by lapsing into his self-censored language and alluding with unusual pertinence to the plot of an Aesopic fable (Aes. 376, notably the same Horace evoked in Sat. 2.3.314–20, the frog who inXates itself): Quid enim, inquit, ambubaia non meminit se? de machina illam sustuli, hominem inter homines feci. At inXat se tamquam rana, et in sinum suum non spuit, codex, non mulier. Petr. 74.13 What then, has she forgotten her past as a courtesan? She was being sold on the market and I took her away from it; I made her a human among humans. Yet she puVs herself up like a frog and doesn’t spit in her bosom. A block of wood, not a woman. Fortunata has struck at the core of her husband’s toilsome repression of his past. Rage and drunkenness unhinge his system of self-censorship. His altered state lifts the censorship imposed on the language of fable and substitutes for Horace’s rhetorical justiWcations. At the close of the episode, while giving his premature funeral oration, a weeping Trimalchio ends the account of his irresistible ascent to power with another fable:51 Credite mihi: assem habeas, assem valeas; habes, habeberis. Sic amicus vester, qui fuit rana, nunc est rex. Petr. 77.6 Believe me: you have a penny, and you are worth a penny; you are worth what you own. So your old friend, who was Wrst a frog, now is a king. The Wnal paradox is perhaps the cruelest: while musing on the power of wealth to transform human beings, Trimalchio betrays through his language the impossibil- ity of such a metamorphosis. If Horace had used fable to mark his independence from a servile past, Trimalchio’s fables only mark him for what he is. When animals talk through a freedman, they articulate the language of slaves. 51. Probably not the fable of the frog and the prince, as traditionally interpreted, but the same fable of the frog and the cow to which Trimalchio referred at 74.13 (Bodel 1984). </page> <page sequence="22"> 328 classical antiquity Volume 24/No. 2 /October 2005 * * * From the analysis of the two case studies presented in this paper a set of preliminary conclusions may be drawn. First, on the level of textual hermeneutics, in both Horace and Petronius the literary redeployment of the genre of animal fable is consistently associated (in varying degrees of immediacy) with the direct presence or indirect evocation of slaves. Second, on the level of literary interpretation, Satire (in the broader deWnition of the term) proves particularly receptive among all literary genres to the incorporation of fables’ plots or language and the negotiation of the issues of authority and power associated with them. The indirect and artistic nature of the evidence I have presented should caution us against exporting the results of this study outside the literary sphere and attempting to project them on a third level, that of a larger socio-cultural analysis. With the support of the most recent interest in the portrayal of slaves in Roman literary imagination, however, a last tentative conclusion may be proposed: the presence of a language and a genre culturally associated with slavery in a literature produced and consumed by their owners well Wts the situation of the Roman social fabric in which slaves coexisted with their masters in a power continuum of submission and domination. If the slaves are “the other self” of their masters, as Fitzgerald suggests, fable is the other self of the genres that incorporate it. Simultaneously concealed and revealed, fable is almost seamlessly absorbed by the hegemonic discourse of literary culture even as it resists full integration through the recognizable marks of its alterity.
