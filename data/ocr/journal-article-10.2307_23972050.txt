In this passage the prophet describes twenty-five men standing in the inner court of the Temple, worshipping the sun. Not only are these abominations being committed in the Temple, but violence is widespread ' and they put the branch (haztemorah) to their nose Aside from its intrinsic importance, this crux interpretum has recently attracted attention because of the brilliant and learned controversy carried on by Prof. Charles C. Torrey and Prof. Shalom Spiegel regarding the proposed Persian date for Ezekiel.1 Prof. Torrey sees in the zcmorah the baresma, or bundle of twigs, used by the worshipper in the Persian sun-worship,2 and therefore finds that the verse ' affords one of the clearest and most conclusive bits of evidence that the book of Ezekiel is a pseudepigraphProf. Spiegel objected to this view,4 but his objections proved inconclusive, largely because he failed to support them by an adequate exegesis for the verse. Nevertheless we believe that Prof. Torrey's proposed identification is untenable and shall suggest a new interpretation for the passage. Our objection to Prof. Torrey's theory is not based on the desire to avoid a Persian date for Ezekiel. Even if the passage be taken as an allusion to a rite in the sun-cult, it could still be maintained, with J. H. Moulton,5 that ' the earliest evidence of the activity (of the Magi) as a sacred tribe is in Ezekiel (viii 17), where they are found at Jeru salem, in or before 591 B.C., worshipping the sun, and holding to their face a branch, which is the predecessor of the late barsornMore than once Biblical passages have been shewn to be earlier than was first believed possible through the discovery of additional material. More over syncretism and borrowing are widespread in religion, and it is a a priori likely that the Persian sun-worship took over many elements from older forms of the same cult. It is therefore not because of the date, but because of two other major considerations that we oppose the identification of the zcmorah and the baresma : A. The position of the clause makes it impossible to interpret it as 1 Prof. Torrey's views were expressed-in his book Pseudo-Ezekiel 1931 ( = PE).

V. 16 is the end of a long passage (ch. viii 6-16) that describes the abominations in the Temple, while vv. 17, 18 constitute the peroration: v. 16. And He brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. v. 17. Then He said unto me: ' Hast thou seen this, Ο son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abomina tions which they commit here, in that they fill the land with violence, and provoke Me still more, and, 10, they put the branch to their nose ? v. 18. Therefore will I also deal in fury; Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in Mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.' Had the phrase in italics referred to any specific rite, its place was above, in v. 16, where other details of the sun-worship are described. In its actual position, however, it must bear a general meaning or the context is utterly destroyed. B. There is a widespread Rabbinic tradition that the Massoretic text of our passage was changed to avoid a cacophonous or blasphemous expression, and that the original reading was 'appi ' My nose י (referring to God) instead of 'appam 'their nose'.1 The Tannaitic sources describe these changes as kinnah hak-kathub, ' Scripture has used euphemistic language', and actually quote the text in the restored form.2 These changes are usually known as tikkune sopherim, ' emendations of the Scribes '.3 To gauge the trustworthiness of this tradition of a changed text, it should be recalled that the fixed purpose of Massoretic activity was the preservation of the received text without change of any sort. Thus the greatest Jewish authorities in medieval times could not believe that the received text might have been changed, and attempted to explain the ancient Tannaitic traditions to mean that the verses were so inter pretedpreted but not correctedThe opposition to change being the dominant tendency, the clear-cut statement that our passage among others has 1 Midrash Tanffuma, Beshallah, sec. 16; the Massorah at beginning of Numbers and on Ps. 106. These sources quote all the eighteen passages where such a change is predicated. Our passage is also included in the briefer lists given in the Μ ec hi It a Μ ec hi It a Μ ec hi It a on Exod. xv 7, and Si/re on Num. χ 35. The Masoretic commentator Norzi on Zech. ii 12 quotes all the instances and discusses them at length. 2 Cf. especially Tanhuma loc. cit. 3 A name given to them by Simon ben Pazzi in Getusis Rabbcth sec. 49, par. 7. 4 See Norzi on Zech. ii 12 and the Rabbinic commentaries on Genesis Rabbah sec. 49, par. 7.</page><page sequence="3">286 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES undergone change should be accepted as valid.1 At the very least the suggested reading should be treated with the respect accorded variants derived from the ancient versions, which are often based upon inferior copies and equally inadequate knowledge. We thus have two criteria for interpreting our passage : (a) the refer· ence to the context, (b) the well-attested variant'appi instead of'appam. On the basis of the context we believe it justifiable to rule out all inter pretations that refer the phrase to some specific rite, such as the Persian sun-cult,2 phallic worship,3 the burning of incense,4 or any apotropaic or healing rite.5 Scholars have noted that what is undoubtedly required is some general meaning after the words ' they continue to provoke me'. Several such explanations have been proposed but they are not likely to commend themselves. Thus the medieval commentator Menahem ben Simon of Posquieres suggested ' they despise me' but advanced no proof for this meaning.' The rendering of LXX μυκτηρίζοντκ, ' they turn up their noseand that of Peshitta, viafqu'in banhirayhon, ' they blow with their noses' undoubtedly suggested by the word 'appam, imply the sense of contempt, but can scarcely be squared with the Hebrew text. Haupt7 arrived at the same sense by claiming that the Syriac zamara meaning ' bluish gray', which is used of eyes of that colour,8 could 1 This assumption is strengthened by the following considerations : (1) In practically all the passages, the proposed reading is by no means homiletical in character, but possesses much to recommend it textually. (2) The changes are slight, such as an altered suffix, as in our passage and in Num. xi 16, Jer. ii 11, Zech. ii 12, Mai. ii 13, Ps. cvi 20, or some other minor changes, as in 1 Sam. iii 13, and elsewhere. This is the natural procedure where the desire is to suggest an idea without expressing it. (3) The same process seems to occur in post-Biblical literature. Cf. Aboth ii 4 ' Do His will as if it were thy will, that He may do thy will as if it were His will. Nullify thy will before His will, that He may nullify the will of others before thy will.' Here, as some of the commentators have noted (Bertinoro, LipschOtz), ' the will of others' is a euphemism for ' His will', which is called for by the parallelism. 2 Maintained by Torrey and others. 3 Proposed by Graetz in M.G.W.J. 1876 pp. 507-508, who based his view on the alleged use of zemorah in Talmudic literature as a euphemism for the membrum virile.virile. See Kohut Aruch complelum, Levy Talmudic Dictionary s.v. A careful study of these passages shews, however, that the Rabbis did not know the meaning of zemorah in Ezekiel, and were interpreting it homiletically. Cf.

Hence the phrase is : ' they send the mucus through their nose, i.e. they snort defiance at me.' Gunkel,1 on the other hand, arrived at the same meaning by emending ןמוךיי into ןךמה ' stream ' which occurs in Ez. xxiii 20, and by reading מעל for אל. The passage then means: ' They blow the mucus out of their noses.' Marmorstein2 equated ztmorah with the Assyrian zumru = ' skin and, adopting the reading ,appi, translated : ' They stretch their skin before me'—as a sign of contempt. That all these renderings are far-fetched and unattractive is evident. We believe that a simpler interpretation is available, based on the original reading 'appi. ' They send the branch into my nose' is a vivid way of saying, ' they harass and irritate me '. Having a twig or thorn thrust into one's face is an obviously unpleasant sensation. To heighten the vividness of the picture, one speaks of' a thorn in the eye' or ' a branch in the nose', rather than ' a thorn in one's face'. We may compare the English phrase, ' he placed it under his nose', where the meaning is ' he placed it before him '. The figure is, indeed, so vivid that when referred to God it becomes crudely anthropomorphic. The idiom is therefore changed, and 'appi ' my nose' becomes 'appam ' their nose'. The same process is at work in the tikkun in Zech. ii 12, where the original ' the pupil of My eye' was changed to ' the pupil of their eye'. The idiom is of course a hapax legomenon, but the figure of thorns as irritants occurs elsewhere in Hebrew : Num. xxxiii 55. 'Then shall those that ye let remain of them, be as thorns in your eyes, and as pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell.' Joshua xxiii 13. ' But they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and pricks in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath given you.' Ezekiel xxviii 24. ' And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a piercing thorn of any that are round about them, that did have them in disdain ; and they shall know that I am the Lord God.' Proverbs xxvi 9. 'As a thorn that cometh into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools ', may well mean that a proverb in the mouth of a fool is as irritating as a thorn in the hand of a drunkard, who in his irresponsible condition uses it to harass his neighbour. It also occurs in later Hebrew.: Exodus Exodus Rabbah i 14 ׳ שהיו ישראל דומי; בעיניהם כקוצים Israel were like thorns in their eyes'.
