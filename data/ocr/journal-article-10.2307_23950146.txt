<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTIAN THOUGHT IN EGYPT ABOUT A. D. 400. Der Papyruscodex saec. VI- VII der Phillippsbibliothek in Cheltenham .. . edited by W. E. Crum, with an Essay by A. Ehrhard. (Karl J. Trubner, Strassburg, 1915.) The book here noticed contains the Coptic text of an ancient Papyrus MS bought by Sir Thomas Phillipps about 1836 and still forming part of his great collection. It was not always easy to find a publisher for Coptic works even before the War, but the Wissen schaftliche Gesellschaft of Strassburg accepted this text transcribed and translated by Mr Crum as one of their publications, and Prof. Ehrhard wrote for it an Essay which serves as a historical Introduction. Then came the War: the book was already printed, or nearly so, and not yet published, but Prof. Ehrhard saw it through the press and after long delays it appeared in 1915. In this way it came to pass that one of the last scientific publications of German Strassburg was the work of an Englishman.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 315 It is a very interesting volume, very well edited. The translation of the Coptic text must have presented many difficulties, but Mr Crum's translation is clear and lucid. Prof. Ehrhard's Introduction is admirable ; he gives reasons for believing that the first two sections, dealing with Cyril of Alexandria and with Horsiesius, are historical, while the rest, dealing with ' Agathonicus of Tarsus ', is fiction, and I venture to think he has proved his point. The special interest of these texts is that they throw a good deal of light upon the world of thought in which the monks lived who inhabited the monasteries founded by Pachomius at Pabau and Tabennisi in Upper Egypt, some 30 miles north of Luxor. Horsiesius was the third Abbot of Pabau (Fâu), and as his immediate predecessor only lived a few months he may be regarded as the virtual successor of Pachomius himself. The second of the tracts in the Phillipps Codex (38-73)1 is an account of the visit made by Horsiesius to Alexandria on the invitation of Theophilus the Patriarch, uncle and predecessor of S. Cyril. Horsiesius was then an old man, he had been 66 years a monk, and Prof. Ehrhard (p. 140) shews reason for supposing that the date was somewhere about a. d. 386. The account opens with the letter of Theophilus inviting Horsiesius to come to Alexandria, because at the annual blessing of the Font the usual miraculous rod of Light had not appeared to the Patriarch, and instead he had heard a mysterious voice telling him that if Horsiesius did not come he would not see what he desired to see (38-41, 46 f). So he sent his Deacons, Faustus and Timotheus, and they brought the old Abbot down the Nile to Alexandria, the narrative says, in six days.2 Arrived at Alexandria, Horsiesius and the Patriarch greet one another with polite speeches and proceed to the Church. It is the very morning of Holy Saturday. Theophilus persuades the old man to accept a new burnous,3 and, as he puts it on, the Patriarch sees the rod of Light blessing the water ! He was both pleased and frightened, and would have stopped then and there, but Horsiesius was unmoved. He told Theophilus to go on from the point he had reached when he heard the mysterious voice and to finish the service. This is why, adds our MS, that the Blessing of the Waters is combined with the ceremonies of Easter to this day (49). The next morning, on Easter Sunday, Theophilus and Horsiesius 1 The numbers are the pages of the Coptic MS, given also in the margin of Crum's German translation. 2 This would mean that the boat went down stream at an average of three-and a-half miles an hour, travelling day and night. Mr Crum (p. 66) thinks it is too quick. 3 Copt, libitou = λίβιτών. Pachomius's monks used this garment as a blanket at night (Hist.

After the Service Theophilus invited Horsiesius to the Feast (άριστον), and Horsiesius made no scruples about accepting, ' for ', he said, ' it is the Patriarch who invites me' (49). Then follows their conversation during the meal: after pretty speeches—Horsiesius compares Theophilus to Lot, through whose prayers Egypt will be saved as Zoar was—the Patriarch asks him what made him become a monk, and Horsiesius answers that it was fear of punishment (κόλασισ) after death. He had been a monk now for 66 years. He is then asked if they accept any one who has a wife and children. ' Yes ', said Horsiesius, ' for it stands written " He who does not leave wife and children for My Name's sake is not worthy of Me"' (50-52). Horsiesius was a layman and the Patriarch wished to ordain him, but the old man refused, saying that their wants were supplied by those that came to them : he took, however, an encomiastic letter from Theophilus to the monks of Fâu, which is given in full (53-59). The account closes with a report of the questions asked of Horsiesius by the Deacons, Faustus and Timotheus, as they journeyed down the Nile. Conversation was conducted through Ulpius (Όλβιοσ), Horsie sius's interpreter, who was no doubt the original source of the whole narrative, as Prof. Ehrhard remarks (p. 145). The two deacons asked the old man about various topics, about Usury, the miracles of Pacho mius and his character, the significance of sickness for good people and bad, the lawfulness of Marriage, why Galilee of the Gentiles was so called when it is evident that our Lord's countrymen were Israelites, whether it is a pious deed to build or ornament Churches, whether we ought always to give away our second coat if we have one, why Eli was guilty as well as his sons, and finally the Deacons ask, ' What sort of teaching ought we to give to the commercial classes, who are wholly immersed in trade?' (59-73). As Prof. Ehrhard points out, these questions are appropriate enough to the Alexandrine clergy, and are quite unlike the sort of things that would be invented in the monastic surroundings of Ulpius the interpreter. It is surely a transcript from the life. Horsiesius is always sensible in his replies, as John the Baptist was before him. He is inclined to allegorize, both the Old Testament and the New. It is noticeable that he never treats the monastic life as the only way of salvation. There have been from time immemorial many Oriental ascetics who were kindly and wise in their general view of life, and Horsiesius seems to have been one of them. And he throws an interesting light on the character of Pachomius, a figure rather hidden</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 317 for us under the veil of conventional hagiography. Timotheus remarked that Pachomius was said to have done many miracles. Horsiesius replies : ' All the same, he would have no one know that they were done through him. For Abba Theodore used to say, that if they brought him any one who had a devil and begged him to cure him he would not be persuaded to do so, but if they waited about the door and flung themselves on the ground before him, he would look angry and take hold of the patient as if to drive him away—and he would cure him that way.' Faustus said : ' I heard he was never cross.' 'Yes', replies Horsiesius, 'he really was gentle with every one he met. Thé Lord always revealed to him every one's character, whether good or bad. With a sinner Pachomius smelt the stink of his sins, with a righteous man he smelt the odour of his good deeds. Yet he was gentle with sinners, to encourage them to make efforts for good. But if one of his disciples fell into evil ways, after reproving him he would turn him from the monastery' (62-64). No doubt, Pachomius was a striking and masterful personality ! I cannot resist pointing out the noticeable parallel, all the more noticeable because unconscious, between Pachomius's cure of the demoniac and the story of our Lord and the Leper (Mk. i 40-44). The opening section of the MS (1-38) gives the questions put by Anthimus and Stephanus, the Deacons—it does not say 'of Alexandria ' (see p. 147)—to S. Cyril. This is not so lifelike a document as the story of Horsiesius's visit to the great world, but Prof. Ehrhard gives good reason for thinking it to be based on historical reminiscence rather than mere invention (pp. 145-154). The topics are very various, ranging from the fate of Judas Iscariot, and the time of penitence required for a man who has practised Magic, to a description of Heaven. It is interesting to notice that Cyril pronounces that little children who die before baptism will inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, because they are the offspring of Christian parents, and ' if the Root be holy so are the Branches' (20}. In the definition of 'Magicians' we find they are people who invoke Demons by means of Names in strange tongues which they find in 'books'. Mr Crum suggests the use of Aramaic words found in the Gospels, such as Ephphatha : is it not more likely that it refers to the Nomina Barbarica found in such Gnostic works as Pistis Sophia, e. g. α(ψονω and ψινωθίρ, not to mention ' Barbelo ' and ' Ialdabaoth ' ? The latter half of the Phillipps MS (73-138) is taken up with the dicta of ' Agathonicus, Bishop of Tarsus in Cilicia ', a personage quite unknown to history. Prof. Ehrhard (p. 154 ff) shews good reason for treating him as altogether fictitious, a mere literary peg upon which to hang theological pronouncements against the anthropomorphism of the</page><page sequence="5">3l8 the journal of theological studies monks of Scete and the spiritual pride of the Stylites of Syria. In any case it has not the same interest as the earlier pieces, which are a real contribution to history. If 'popular piety, and the phrases and forms in which it clothes itself, are the truest tests of the genuine spirit of religion ',' then this publication, which deals with the difficulties of ordinary Egyptian Christians belonging to the generation that saw the year a. d. 400, is truly important. It was an age of great theological controversies and definitions ; it saw the last rally of the old Pagan religion. But, the picture our document gives of Theophilus and Cyril is not that of the destroyer of the Serapeum or of the adversary of Nestorius, but rather that of two well-meaning ecclesiastics occupied in the difficult task of adapting a religion conceived and formulated for an obscure minority to become the Established Church of the civilized world. I had thought of calling this notice of Mr Crum's publication 'Contemporaries of Hypatia', for the view of the times we get from the Phillipps Codex is almost contemporary with the scene of Charles Kingsley's Novel. It is a picture drawn in quieter, soberer tones: Cyril the Patriarch is a gentler, more human figure, and his uncle Theophilus, to whom in general the verdict of Church Historians is unfavourable, is portrayed quite sympathetically. But in both pictures we see the soulless mediocrity of secular Alexandria, and the men of good sense and firm character despairing of the world and taking refuge in the Thebaid. And over all who thought there broods in both pictures the fear of hell-fire. No doubt it was so all over the Christian world, but it was particularly the case in Egypt, where the old native doctrine of Amente, the Underworld of retribution, had only been reinforced by the ideas of the new religion. ' In the Day of Judgement what will happen?' asks Stephanus the deacon, and Cyril answers : ' A multitude of those who have been punished will find grace, but those who go on the left side go to a resurrection of Judge ment' (20, 21). Other parts of Christendom might tremble at the thought of the Last Day : to the Egyptian Christian it brought the notion of a possible escape from Purgatory. F. C. Burkitt. F. C.
