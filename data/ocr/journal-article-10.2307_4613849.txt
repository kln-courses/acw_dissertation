Surely R stands for religion, religare, something to bind us back, to remind that-whether reading, kneeling, or waving goodbye-a word can enter our womb in a breath. Bordered with heads, each open mouth tongued orange or blue with the tip of a pen, the letter R could be autumn, all parchment and loss, each leaf embedded with flame. More like enunciation, I should think, with the lungs a heavy butterfly heaving its cocoon, and the conception some act of ventriloquism, immaculate and marooned. Perhaps R is for rental-as in the villa where they sit, Mary and Gabriel tilting their heads. And the goldleaf rolling in wherever space remains is nothing but time, in which everything floats.

Slowly lowered, the hands meet again, cupping each other the way Adam and Eve hid from God their most private parts, the parts he could not bear to see. Like flags waved by sailors from decks of separate ships, their hands made the semaphore which means end of word.</page></plain_text>
