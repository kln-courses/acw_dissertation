Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts Contributed by P. J. Darlington, Jr., July 7, 1975 ABSTRACT Evolution of altruism by group selection in- volves sacrifice of some individuals, not to the "group as a whole," but to other individuals in the group. Deme-group se- lection may establish strictly altruistic genes in a population, but only under limited conditions, and perhaps never among vertebrates, among which apparently altruistic behaviors may always potentially benefit the altruists. Responsive- group selection is a more effective mode of evolution of al- truism, conspicuous in man. Evolutionary reinforcement in- creases the force of selection of advantageous behaviors, in- cluding altruistic ones, by making them pleasant or reward- ing. It is probably involved also in ecological habitat selec- tion, and may be the source of many human emotions, in- cluding esthetic ones. Throwing (of stones and weapons) ex- emplifies both the possible importance of a difficult-to-mea- sure evolutionary factor and the role of reinforcement; in human evolution throwing may have been decisive in food- getting and fighting, in shifting emphasis from brute force to skill, and in inducing evolution of a brain able to handle three-body geometric problems precisely and thus preadapt- ed for more complex functions. This short paper is concerned with components of evolution, including human evolution, which are usually looked at too narrowly, or overlooked. GROUP SELECTION AND ALTRUISM Group selection, especially as a mode of evolution of al- truism, is under continuing scrutiny now (e.g., refs. 1-5). It is important in itself, and it may have played an important role in human evolution. Evolutionists should, therefore, present it in nontechnical terms that will be clear and useful to anthropologists, sociologists, and other interested persons. Phrases such as "group selection overrides individual se- lection" and "selection operates on the group as a whole" are used by most group selectionists. It is legitimate to con- sider groups as wholes, but phrases like these invite misun- derstanding. They invite an unanalytical holism, an idea, held even by some biologists (6), that selection of groups-as- wholes does more than in fact it can do, and that sacrifice of the individual to the group-as-whole is an established evolu- tionary principle. It is not, or rather it can be looked at in another way. What actually happens in the cases in question is that some individuals ("altruists") are sacrificed or sacri- fice themselves or their chance of reproducing to the advan- tage of other individuals in the group, and that therefore the group survives. If this is holism, it is reductionist holism, capable of conceptual and mathematical analysis. Group or set selection may be broadly defined as differen- tial elimination and survival of groups or sets at all conceiv- able nonliving and living levels (ref. 7; and see supplementa- ry notes at end of the present paper). Biologists usually tacit- ly restrict "group selection" to selection among groups of conspecific individual organisms, but the groups may be of various kinds, some of which are specified below. 37' ement, and throwing in human 02138 Biological altruism may be broadly defined as including all conditions and behaviors by which some individuals ben- efit others of the same species without benefitting them- selves, but the altruism may be either indirect or direct, in- voluntary or voluntary, one-way or reciprocal (ref. 8; ref. 4, pp. 120-121), and nonresponsive or responsive. Examples are given below. The deme-selection model Deme selection is a relatively simple form of group selec- tion, suited to analysis. Demes are small groups or subpopu- lations of individuals localized in different places within the boundaries of a larger population (or "metapopulation"), so that they are partly or temporarily isolated from each other. Deme selection occurs when demes vary in their composi- tion and when, as a result of the variation, some demes die out and are replaced by dispersal from surviving demes. Simple models of evolution of altruism by deme selection consist of sets of demes made up of varying numbers of two kinds of individuals: non-A's, which are not altruists, and A's, or altruists, which have a gene (allele) which reduces their fitness but causes them to contribute to the survival or reproductive success of other individuals. A's might feed other individuals, or fight for them, or sacrifice themselves for them, voluntarily or involuntarily. The particular model now to be considered involves al- truism by involuntary self-sacrifice. In it, A's have a gene causing a physiological defect, which reduces their fitness but makes them unpalatable to a predator which, after kill- ing and tasting an A, refrains from attacking other individu- als in the deme. This model is presented in more detail and analyzed mathematically by Levin and Kilmer (2), who con- clude that deme selection can maintain or increase the pro- portion of A's in a population, if the demes are small (com- posed of usually not more than 10 effectively reproducing individuals), if some but not too much dispersal of individu- als occurs between demes (not more than about 5% a genera- tion), and if the process of extinction and replaoement of demes is rapid. In this model, the A's are comparable to a limited, ex- pendable resource, presence of which in the environment is advantageous to non-A's and surviving A's; which is gradual- ly expended in single demes; but which is randomly and, therefore, unequally divided when new demes are formed; and which favors survival of individuals in the new demes that happen to get the most of it. These demes survive, and individuals from them, including their more-than-average numbers of A's, recolonize places where demes with fewer A's have been exterminated. If Levin and Kilmer's mathematical analysis is correct, this process can establish an altruistic gene in a population. 8</page><page sequence="2">Zoology: Darlington But it can do so only under very limited conditions, and it is not likely to be important if other processes are more effec- tive under more general conditions. A small change in the model does change the process and make it more generally effective. If some A's are attacked, tasted, and released with- out being killed, selection may favor A's directly, and this probably often happens in actual cases. In some cases, unpa- latable animals apparently evolve adaptations to being tast- ed with minimum injury. For example, in Cuba warningly colored (red and blue) lycid beetles, which are distasteful to lizards, seem structurally and physiologically adapted to bleed instantly and copiously when slightly squeezed, and lizards which seize them release them promptly without se- riously injuring them (9). In cases like this, A's benefit them- selves and are no longer strict altruists, although they may have secondary altruistic effects. To the theoretical limitations of the preceding deme-se- lection model, it should be added that the kind of one-way altruism, between A's and non-A's, considered in the model may not occur in the real world, at least not among verte- brates. It is doubtful if any vertebrate populations include genetically differentiated individuals, like those in the model, which behave altruistically with no chance of self- benefit; limitation of space prevents detailed discussion of this generalization here. However, the model is well worth conceptual analysis. In the following pages I shall look at it in a different way, and consider alternatives. Other viewpoints and other models Some concepts that are, or ought to be, truisms must be stat- ed. Groups cannot exist independent of their individuals; whatever favors survival of a group must favor survival of one or more individuals in it. Groups die only by deaths of individuals, or by their failure to reproduce; group selection differs from individual selection only in that all individuals of some groups die. [But the effect on evolution of the deaths of all individuals in a group is very different from the effect of the deaths of only some of the individuals (10).] And, less obvious but I think also true, all group selection can be con- verted into terms of individual selection, if concepts are pre- cisely defined and adhered to. A concept that requires precise definition is: fitness and selection (i.e., chances of survival and reproduction) depend on the whole animal, including its whole behavior, in the whole environment, at the time fitness is measured or selec- tion occurs. (Of course this is holism of a sort, but again it is reductionist holism, capable of analysis.) If this concept is accepted literally, as it should be in this connection, what really happens in the preceding deme-se- lection model is that, in an environment that includes A's at the time selection occurs, the fitness and chances of survival of individuals that are not sacrificed are increased. A's are sacrificed, not to the group as a whole, but to other individu- als in the group, both non-A's and other A's. This point of view removes any mystery there may be in this example of "selection of the group as a whole." An alternative (one of several) to the simple model of evo- lution of altruism by deme selection is worth special consid- eration. It involves direct, reciprocal, behavioral, responsive altruism, which occurs when an altruistic behavior evokes a response from other altruists. Something like it has been sug- gested before (e.g. ref. 1, p. 685; ref. 4, pp. 120-121, with additional references), but I do not think the effect of direct response on selection and evolution of reciprocal altruism Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72 (1975) 3749 has been sufficiently considered. Altruism often does involve visible behaviors; behaviors often do evoke responses; and responses may be made only by response-capable individu- als. If, for example, individual A's carry a gene for helping others, and if A's offer to help all other individuals in a pop- ulation, but if the offers are accepted only by other A's, a be- havioral mutual-helping group will be formed within the population. Such a group might begin with the appearance, by muta- tion, of a dominant altruistic gene (allele) in a population of non-A's. The single individual mutant A would offer respon- sive altruism to other individuals but would evoke no re- sponses, and the time and energy spent in making the offers would presumably somewhat reduce its chances of surviv- ing. In most cases, the individual, and the altruistic gene, would be eliminated from the population. Occasionally, however, a mutant A would happen to survive and repro- duce, and half its offspring would be expected to be A's. If the altruistic mutation were recessive, more than one behav- ioral A (homozygous individual expressing the behavior) would be expected occasionally in the F2 generation. In ei- ther case, when two or more A's appeared, responsive al- truistic behavior would give them an immediate selective advantage, and a behavioral group would be initiated. Even without further isolation, the members of the group might tend to interbreed simply because they are drawn to- gether. And reproductive coherence of the group might be increased by secondary factors which reinforce the altruistic behavior by adding emotional rewards to it, or which tend to exclude non-A's from the behavioral group. Groups like this may have a selective advantage "as wholes," and may evolve by group selection. But the selective advantage of the group can be converted into terms of the selective advan- tages of individual A's in an environment that includes other A's. Of course groups like this are conspicuous in man, and in a simpler form they occur in all mammals and birds (and many other animals) in which individuals gather together for defense, or to feed, or to migrate. Their evolution does not depend on deme selection. It is doubtful if deme selec- tion as modeled at the beginning of this paper has played any direct role in the evolution of altruism in man, although deme selection has surely played an important indirect or supplementary role (see supplementary notes). [The origin and evolution of worker-queen altruism in social insects is different and harder to understand. I have suggested a tri- determinant model for its evolution (10), and E. 0. Wilson (11) has described its diverse manifestations and considered its evolution from other points of view.] EVOLUTIONARY REINFORCEMENT Altruistic behavior may, as suggested above, be strengthened by evolutionary reinforcement, that is, by evolution making altruistic acts pleasurable. Students of the behavior of living animals and man have emphasized reinforcement, and have analyzed and divided it until its definitions and subdefini- tions make 40-odd entries in the Dictionary of Behavioral Science (12). Something like evolutionary reinforcement of behavior has occasionally been suggested (see supplementa- ry notes) but I do not think it has been recognized as an evo- lutionary principle. It should be. Reinforcement has proba- bly been a continual, decisive factor in evolution of behav- ior. Selectively advantageous behaviors have continually been reinforced during evolution, sometimes by making al-</page><page sequence="3">3750 Zoology: Darlington ternatives unpleasant, but often by adding satisfactions and rewards which are not themselves directly advantageous but which increase the force of selection of the advantageous be- haviors. Reinforcement in behavioral ecology Evolutionary reinforcement probably plays an important role in "behavioral ecology." Ecologists ought to ask, but do not often do so: why does an animal stay in the environment it is adapted to? The animal surely does not calculate the ad- vantages. The answer probably is that the animal finds its environment satisfying or pleasant. This answer does not please modern quantitative ecologists, for satisfactions and pleasures are difficult to isolate and measure, but the answer seems to be the only one that explains environmental choice by many birds and mammals. Although this has apparently not been recognized as a principle by ecologists, it has been suggested in special cases (see supplementary notes). "Im- printing" (see any textbook of behavior) is a more obvious special case of reinforcement of selectively advantageous be- havior. Of course the satisfactions and pleasures involved in evolutionary reinforcement are not immaterial but have physiological, hormonal, or neurological bases, and can rea- sonably be considered reinforcing components of behavioral wholes, genetically controlled, and capable of heritable vari- ation and evolution by selection. They must evolve before the more obvious structural and behavioral characteristics that determine fitness can be effective. Reinforcement and esthetics Evolutionists ought to look for reinforcement in the evolu- tionary history of man. It has probably occurred frequently, and it may be the origin of many human emotions, includ- ing the pleasure men take in performing altruistic acts (13). It may also be the origin of man's esthetic emotions. Our esthetic appreciations are primarily emotional. We do not enjoy a landscape or the sound of music because our reason tells us to, although our complex brains have greatly increased the complexity of the pictures and music we enjoy. Some esthetic emotions are evidently based on sex. But the pleasure we feel in looking at an appropriate piece of the environment, or a picture of it, may be the same sort of pleasure that an ape or a mouse feels in its environment and that keeps it there. And the pleasure we take in hearing the human voice and (by extension) music may have its evo- lutionary source in emotional reinforcement of social com- munication. Increasingly complex vocal communication was surely selectively advantageous during human evolution, and its selection was presumably reinforced and strength- ened by making both the uttering and the hearing of appro- priate sounds a pleasure. Other mammals that communicate by sounds presumably feel something like the same pleasure, for the same reason, and so probably do birds. Evolution has probably reinforced birds' singing by making both the sing- ing and the hearing of it by other birds pleasurable. If this is anthropomorphism, it is a realistic anthropomorphism, and it should not be carried too far. Human pleasure and bird pleasure may be very different. Birds are not little people. THROWING Modern evolutionists concentrate on what they can see and measure. This is good, but only up to a point. Some compo- nents of evolution that cannot yet be measured have proba- Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72 (1975) bly been'important too. Evolutionary reinforcement is one. It has probably been an unmeasured factor in many special cases of evolution of behavior. Throwing is a special case which exemplifies both the possible importance of a diffi- cult-to-measure factor in (human) evolution and the role of reinforcement. Anatomical modifications of the arm for throwing are not conspicuous; fossil arm bones are rare; and thrown stones, unlike "pebble tools," were presumably scattered and not brought together at camp sites where they can be recog- nized. There is, therefore, no clearly visible evidence of the evolution of man's throwing arm and throwing behavior. Hamilton (ref. 14, pp. 129-130), noting and criticizing an earlier hypothesis of K. R. L. Hall, makes some guesses about the origin of throwing in relation to other behaviors, but oth- erwise throwing has been largely ignored by students of pri- mate and human evolution, although the evolution of pri- mate locomotion (throwing must be coordinated with loco- motion) has been studied in detail. Washburn (15) has writ- ten a classic paper on tools and human evolution and (16) has compared the locomotor functions of the arm in ape and man; Robinson (17) and Jenkins (18) have written or edited books on primate locomotion; and several recent authors (e.g., refs. 19-21) have written excellent books on primate or human evolution, including evolution of the skeleton, brain, and behavior, but none of these works includes more than casual mention of throwing. Nevertheless, the human arm has evolved as an efficient, unique sling. No other animal can throw as man does. Other primates do throw sticks and stones, but only awkwardly. Van Lawick-Goodall, cited by Wilson (ref. 4, p. 173), rec- ords 44 objects thrown by wild chimpanzees, with only 5 hits, all within 2 meters, and none damaging. Compare this with human throwing. A skilful man has a good chance to break the skull of another man with one stone at 30 meters. Throwing (of spears and clubs) is the only, and very effec- tive, means of killing at a distance among some primitive people, including the Australian Aborigines, who do not use the bow. "Stoning" was still a means of fighting and of exe- cution in Biblical times and, more rarely, still is. Although there is no direct evidence, there is some collat- eral evidence of the time available for the evolution of throwing. Robinson (ref. 17, p. 245) says that the posture, proportions, and "static and dynamic balance" of H. (= Australopithecus) africanus probably gave it "considerable capacity to use the body for such actions as wielding tools and weapons, throwing, and so forth." Australopithecines of the africanus type are now dated, as fossils, as far back as 5.5 million years ago (ref. 20, p. 95). And Washburn and Moore (ref. 21, p. 122), summarizing evidence that is widely known, say that australopithecines in South Africa were making and using pebble tools (which is more complex be- havior than throwing unworked stones) more than 3 million years ago. There are therefore several million years available for the evolution of man's throwing arm and effective throwing behavior. Throwing may have played three roles in human evolu- tion. First, it was and sometimes still is directly useful in food-getting and fighting (see again supplementary notes). Second, it may have played a special, decisive role in evolu- tion of the human brain (see below). And third, it may have had decisive social effects. The thrown stone was perhaps the first effective "equalizer" (compare the six-gun in the Old West), which shifted selective advantage from brute force to skill (from Goliath to David) and from force-domi-</page><page sequence="4">Zoology: Darlington nated hierarchies to more cooperative and diversified orga- nizations. To come back to the brain, it is a commonplace that struc- ture and function evolve together. When, during the evolu- tion of ape into man, the brain increased in size and com- plexity, it was presumably performing new functions. To say that its principal new function was exercise of intelligence is not enough. Intelligence is an imprecise concept, and intelli- gent behavior involves delay in responses and may be less advantageous to most animals than instantaneous stereo- typed behavior. The evolving human brain probably per- formed more specific functions, of more direct selective ad- vantage. Effective throwing was surely selectively advanta- geous, and it probably required evolution of a brain with special, new characteristics. Most animal behavior is concerned with not more than two principal moving objects (the animal itself and another animal), and the brain need not model the relationship be- tween the two with great precision. But effective throwing requires precise correlation of three moving objects (the ani- mal, the object thrown, and another animal). Probably noth- ing that apes do requires such complex correlation or such precision. The solving of three-body problems--that is, the modeling of complex geometric patterns with the precision required for effective throwing-may have been a decisive factor in the evolution of the pre-human brain. [I suggested this 18 years ago, in a publication unlikely to be noticed by students of human evolution (ref. 22, pp. 624-625).] Obviously, throwing was only one of many factors in the evolution of the human brain. It may have been directly im- portant only during the australopithecine stage of pre- human evolution, during which the brain increased gradual- ly in size and presumably in complexity. But during this stage throwing may have been a decisive factor in preadapt- ing the brain to perform still more complex and precise functions later: in counting (the first step toward arithmetic and mathematics), geometry, and language. Of course this is only the bare outline of one hypothetical, invisible, and un- quantifiable sequence of adaptation, preadaptation, and fur- ther adaptation in the complex evolutionary history of man. This hypothesis can be extended. Evolution evidently re- inforced throwing behavior by making it pleasurable, which it still is, and the pleasure may have been extended to doing other complex activities precisely, that is, to taking pride and pleasure in good workmanship. This is another unquan- tifiable characteristic of man which presumably has an evo- lutionary origin. We now know that throwing ability varies and is at least partly heritable (23), which is consistent with its evolution by selection. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES In order to keep the body of this paper simple and straight- forward, some details have been relegated to the following supplementary notes. Group selection in a broad sense is differential elimination at any level, of groups pre-formed by processes at lower lev- els; this is an essential concept of multi-level evolution. Group selection in this sense plays an overriding, limiting, and supplementing role in all organic evolution. For exam- ple, during human evolution, group selection must have sup- plemented individual selection in evolution of throwing be- havior, of an increasingly complex brain, and of vocal com- munication, by continual elimination of groups (families, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 72 (1975) 3751 demes, tribes, and nations) in which individuals performed relatively poorly. Group selection is also a homeostatic pro- cess which controls rates of evolution. For further discussion see ref. 10. A clear distinction should be made between evolution of the emotions themselves (considered by Darwin) and the role of certain emotions (pleasure, etc.) in reinforcing the se- lection and evolution of advantageous behaviors, or as parts of behavioral wholes. Although this seems not to have been emphasized as an evolutionary principle, many limited ex- amples are scattered through the enormous literature of evo- lution, ecology, and behavior. For example, Lack (ref. 24, pp. 4-5) and Krebs (ref. 25, pp. 29-34) describe "habitat se- lection" by birds in terms that suggest birds' pleasure (al- though this word is not used) in their environments. Lorenz and Leyhausen (ref. 26, pp. 234-235) consider pleasure in relation to some animal behaviors, including play. Rensch (ref. 27, pp. 90-91) suggests esthetic factors in animal behav- ior, including birds' pleasure in singing. Jolly (ref. 19, p. 212) thinks that "Primates stay in groups because they like to, ..." Hamburg (28) discusses emotions, including pleasure, "in the perspective of human evolution." And Washburn and Lancaster (29) suggest the role of pleasure in evolution of hunting and war. Morris (30) emphasizes that chim- panzees take pleasure in painting, and notes (pp. 158-159) that when one chimpanzee was rewarded for painting, the quality of its art deteriorated until "any old scribble" was followed by a request for reward. All these authors give ad- ditional references. Behaviorists recognize pleasure as rein- forcement but not, I think, as a factor in evolution. For ex- ample, Alcock (ref. 31, p. 222) notes that the brain's limbic system produces "sensations of pleasure (positive reinforce- ment)," and King (32) discusses reinforcement in an evolu- tionary context, but neither of these authors specifically con- siders emotional reinforcements as factors in evolution of se- lectively advantageous behaviors. The selective advantage of throwing presumably depend- ed partly on its use in hunting. Many anthropologists and ev- olutionists now think that man's ancestors were in fact meat- eating hunters (actually omnivores, with meat relatively im- portant in the diet) for millions of years, and that this was an essential stage in pre-human evolution (e.g., refs. 33 and 34). This is not a new idea. Read (35), in 1925, argued persu- asively that "man was differentiated from the anthropoids by becoming a hunter," and refers to pertinent publications back to 1900, and to hints by both Darwin and Wallace. Almost every statement of fact and every generalization in this short paper has, of necessity, been oversimplified. I hope that readers will understand this, and will find the sim- plifications fair and useful. I thank Prof. Edward 0. Wilson for reading a preliminary draft of this manuscript, and for useful comments. 1. Wilson, E. 0. (1973) "Group selection and its significance for ecology," BioScience 23, 631-638. 2. Levin, B.
