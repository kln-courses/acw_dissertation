NEW DISCOVERIES AT GUMELNITZA BY VLADIMIR DUMITRESCU Chief of Research Division Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of the Socialist Republic of Rumania, Bucharest 162</page><page sequence="2">Gumelnitza is the name given to a large natural mound situated about sixty kilometers (thirty-seven miles) southeast of Bucharest and four kilometers east of Oltenitza. Once part of the ancient terrace of the Danube, it is now separated from it by a valley. The mound covers an area of about two hectares (nearly five acres) and rises to a height of several meters above the surrounding countryside. Excavations in this mound have given us most important information about the life and culture of the region in prehistoric times. Even as early as the last century - before any exca- vating had been done - it was known that Gumelnitza was an ancient site. It was incorrectly identified as Constantiniana Daphne, a city known to have been founded by Constantine the Great north of the Danube. Until forty years ago, however, the site had not been systematically explored. A few chance finds in 1924 showed that there had been a Late Neolithic settlement here, and that there was no later occupa- tion. These finds determined us to undertake (in 1925) the first systematic excavation. Although we were limited by the fact that most of the area was cov- ered with vineyards, the excavation had significant re- sults. Not only did it show the importance of the site but it provided the first stratigraphy of a culture which was then named the Gumelnitza culture. Settlements of this culture have been identified north of the Danube throughout Muntenia (Wal- lachia) and in the south of Moldavia, and south and southeast of the Danube, in the Dobruja and in cen- tral and eastern Bulgaria, both north and south of the Balkan Mountains, and as far as Thrace. In broad outline the Gumelnitza culture has three phases: Alf A2 and B (or I, II and III, as some prefer to call them) ; phase B is again divided into two stages. In order to obtain more precise stratigraphy for the site of Gumelnitza, we began another sounding there in I960. Although the vineyards had recently been re- moved, the new sounding was made in the same place as in 1925, not only because the rest of the area was being used for other cultivation but also because the vineyards had badly disturbed the top layer. We found that in this zone the whole cultural deposit was more than four fneters deep at only a few points and that besides the upper layer (phase B) there were three more levels of dwellings in the highest zone of the settlement, all belonging to phase A2. In the spring of 1963, in a zone close to the ex- cavations of 1925 and 1926, there was discovered a series of pottery pieces of unusual importance. Mr. Barbu Ionescu, director of the District Museum of Oltenitza, succeeded in stopping agricultural work at the site, and excavated a large part of the remains of a dwelling with which the pottery was associated. Some of the finds were quite exceptional, even unique, and they deserve to become known as soon as possible. The dwelling had been destroyed by fire and the remains of its walls were scattered irregularly over a large area, with gaps caused by the holes dug for the vineyard. Detailed studies of the dwelling were thus not possible, but we were able to note that, as in other settlements of the Gumelnitza culture, the walls con- sisted of a rather massive wooden framework covered by a thick layer of clay. The fire caused the walls to become lumps of burnt clay bearing imprints of the woodwork. These lay 35-50 cm. below present ground level and undoubtedly belong to the latest level, level B. Mixed in with the lumps of burnt clay was a great deal of pottery - all handmade - among which were some ritual objects and a few bits of flint tools. On the northeast side of the house were the remains of a simple hearth made of baked clay; the preserved part is oval, 80-90 cm. in diameter. Inside the lower half of a large vase were found some fifteen small biconical bowls of baked clay, while a short distance away lay fragments of similar bowls which had been broken and scattered. The large vessel, painted in three colors, must have been im- ported, as it is typical of the Cucuteni culture, which is located in Moldavia and Southeastern Transyl- vania, to the northeast. It is certain, however, that the vase was found in situ and that its upper half had been chopped off by farming activities. This Cucuteni vase, as well as a smaller one and some fragments of the same cultural phase, all found in the same dwell- ing, are of considerable importance for chronology, which will be discussed later. In describing the finds, we shall start with what is clearly the most important piece. The pottery follows in groups according to decoration : first, the vases dec- orated with graphite paint, then crusted ware, then vases .with incised and plastic ornament and, finally, the imported Cucuteni vessels. The most important single piece is a female statu- ette supporting a vase on its head (Figure 1). It was found in a horizontal position about 2.40 meters from the hearth, the head separated from the body. At some distance lay a small vase which proved to belong to the figure. Greatly affected by the fire which consumed the building, this figure was not only broken but cal- cined and partly distorted. There are numerous cracks and the surface, once reddish-brown, has turned whit- ish from the conflagration. Inside are blisters formed by the liquefying of the clay as a result of the high temperature. The incongruously large head presents the unex- 163</page><page sequence="3">4.

GUMELNITZA continued pected peculiarity of two identical faces - a female Janus! The nose is very marked, the mouth is a hori- zontal slit underlined by a row of small holes, but the eyes are indicated only by a long hollow on each side of the nose. The ears have huge lobes, each pierced by five holes, like those common on clay and bone fig- ures of the Gumelnitza and other Neolithic cultures. The head is joined by an excessively broad neck to a short body in the shape of a hollow truncated cone (representing a bell-shaped garment), with two pro- trusions for the breasts. The disproportionately long arms support a rather flat piriform vase^-a common Gumelnitza type - placed on the head. The garment is decorated with stripes made by ver- tical incised lines; under each arm two stripes are joined by a horizontal stripe at the top. The stripes are outlined in white and painted red, a shade darker than that of the clay itself. There are traces of what looks like white paint on the head, some parts of the arms and the lower part of the body, but this is prob- ably the result of a chemical process caused by the fire. A whitish color, apparently intentional, is also seen on the bottom of the vase. The red stripes and their white lines were painted after the original firing. This statuette is the only one of its kind preserved almost entire, but three other fragmentary examples are known. Of these, two are published here for the first time, one found earlier at Gumelnitza, the other at Cäscioarele. The third, found at Vidra, near Bu- charest, has been previously published. All belong to the Gumelnitza culture. A head fragment which was discovered by Mr. 164</page><page sequence="4">8. Graphite-painted jars found with the small biconical bowls.

The firing temperature was not uniform, as the surface is reddish-brown and the fabric blackish-gray. The eyes in both its faces are almond-shaped and surrounded by a groove; in the center is a small hole to denote the pupil. On one face the nose is realistically modeled but without nostrils ; on the other, the nose is broken off. The ears too are missing but the small holes that pierced them can still be seen on one side. Traces of red paint are vis- ible on some parts of the face; other parts are fire- blackened. Another fragment (Figure 3), found some years ago at the Late Neolithic settlement of Cãscioarele (see Archaeology 18 [1965] 34-40), has the ad- vantage of not being distorted. Its aspect therefore is much more natural. The blackish-gray clay is very fine ; the surface is burnished. As in the other two, the head shows two faces. The eyes are barely indicated, but the nose is realistically treated, with two little hollows for nostrils ; the mouth is like that of the new Gumelnitza statuette (see Figure 1). The modeled ear lobes, perforated by six holes, have broken off. Only the bottom of a vase remains on the head. The massive neck and the head are hollow and we must assume that the body was also hollow. A distinct demarcation inside between the vase and the head proves that the vase was made separately and added on, as is the case with our new figure. Another example of this type of statuette is a frag- ment found at Vidra, which, however, has only one face. The excavator described it (D. V. Rosetti in Ipek 12 [1938] 29-30, plate 24/1-25/1) as the hollow base of a vessel like a fruit stand, and considered the arms (now missing) to be the handles of the vase. Since the head is not separate from the body, it was not understood that a complete figure is represented. Similar forms have also been found in other Neo- lithic cultures. A fragment found in the settlement of Luka-Vrublevetzkaia in the Ukraine, on the east bank of the Dniester River, dates from the end of the Middle Neolithic and belongs to phase III of the pre- Cucuteni culture (=Tripolye A, according to the classification of Soviet archaeologists). Its discoverer, S. N. Bibikov, rightly considers it part of a vase with anthropomorphic support. Though the fragment in- cludes only the head, a small part of the body and one arm supporting the missing vase, it is quite clear that this too was a statuette with a bell-shaped garment. This makes us believe it to be of the same group as those of the Gumelnitza culture and not of the group of supports mentioned by Bibikov - joined headless human bodies - which have been found at Tripolye A sites as well as in Cucuteni settlements (Frumu§ica). At the Voina mound in Bulgaria were found many fragments which J. H. Gaul (The Neolithic Period in Bulgaria [Cambridge, Mass. 1948] 118 and plate LV,2-LVI, 3-5) considered as belonging to a statu- ette with a Janus-type head. But these are fragments of an anthropomorphic vase with feet (like so many others of the Gumelnitza culture) rather than an ac- tual statuette. In the group of vessels decorated with graphite paint before firing, the most important piece is a thin- walled, burnished vase with two cylindrical necks (Figure 4), unfortunately distorted by the conflagra- tion. The upper part of the body and the necks are decorated with graphite, which here and there has turned white from the action of the fire. The design on one neck is like a chess-board with a band of tri- angles around the rim; the other neck displays a pat- tern of elongated lozenges. The upper part of the body has a pattern derived from the running spiral, while the central zone is decorated with groups of parallel incised lines. Although the decoration on this vase is common on Gumelnitza pottery, its shape is unique in this culture. Another interesting example of this ware is a bowl with a high hollow foot (Figure 5) . The whole vessel except the inside of the foot is covered with a fine burnished slip, now of a whitish cast. The graphite paint used for the outside of the rim and the pattern in the interior has also turned whitish ; this change in color from shining gray to white is frequently found on the graphite-painted pottery. A two-handled vase (Figure 6) may also be con- sidered as part of this group although it has incised and plastic ornamentation as well as graphite paint. The upper half of the body and both handles are painted. The burnished upper and central parts are reddish in color, while the unburnished lower part is yellowish-brown, in some places blackened by smoke. The graphite-painted linear designs have turned white. The unpainted central zone has alternating panels of four incised vertical lines and areas with two knobs, filled with punctate dots. The unusual shape of the handles - perhaps meant to be phallic - suggests that this vessel was connected with ritual, especially since innumerable phalli of baked clay have been found at Gumelnitza sites as well as those of other Neolithic cultures of southeastern Europe. To this group belong the biconical bowls (Figure 7) which were found in the Cucuteni vase, as well as those scattered nearby. These are all made of fine clay ; 167</page><page sequence="7">GUMELNITZA continued some have a burnished slip all over the outside except on the bottom, while others are burnished inside as well. Still others have a slip only on the upper part of the exterior, the rest being left somewhat rough. Some show an accentuated central ridge extending around the vessel. All these little bowls were graphite- painted before firing, either on the upper part of the body or on the central ridge. Their geometric decora- tion produces a pleasing effect despite little variation. With these little bowls were discovered two taller vases (Figure 8) which are closely related to this group. One has two knob handles and its mouth is slightly oval with pointed ends. On both vases the reddish-brown slip and the graphite paint have turned white in a few places. The slip covers the top half of the vases and the decoration is like that on the bowls. The last piece in the group of graphite-painted ware is a convex lid (Figure 9) on which may be seen re- mains of a linear painted design. Another group is that of crusted ware (in which paint is thickly applied after firing). This includes a unique vessel of a quite special type (Figure 10). From the outside this vase seems to have a truncated conical neck, a rather bulging body and a spout. But in fact the vase has no base but a double wall, with the space between accessible only through the spout. This inner circular space is the real container, as in a samo- var. It is likely that this vessel was used in the same way - to keep a liquid hot. The outside of this amaz- ing vessel is covered with a thin white slip, now nearly vanished, on which the designs were outlined with thick white paint and filled in with thick red-brown paint. The same type of design is found on the foot of another vase, but such polychromy is not common in the Gumelnitza pottery. An unusual piece of red and white crusted ware is a convex lid with a handle in the form of a stylized bull's head with long horns (Figure 11). The base of the neck is fastened to the lid and the two horns ex- tend almost to the rim. The whole top was painted after firing. Another convex lid of crusted ware is decorated with a spiral of pasty white paint running from center to rim, over a brown slip (Figure 12). A fragmentary bowl with designs in graphite paint on the interior has on the exterior concentric fluted double circles covered with a dark red, beautifully burnished slip (Figure 13). The spaces between the circles are painted white. A small piriform vase (Figure 14) has the rim and broad central zone covered with a burnished brown slip painted red and white after firing. The design on the body, derived from the running spiral, is red out- lined in white against the brown background. The lower part of the vase was first scraped and then cov- ered with thick white paint now largely gone. The bottom is pierced by two holes. Other fragments of crusted ware have light red bottoms decorated with curved or angular lines in dark red bordered by broad white stripes, sometimes very carelessly drawn. The third group of pottery includes vessels of vari- ous shapes with incised and plastic decoration. The most numerous are lids, high-shouldered vases and bowls. Most of the lids were found broken but could be restored. Some are of considerable size - the la'rgest 39 cm. in diameter - while others are smaller. The handles also vary in form. Some lids are decorated with fluting, either concentric (Figure 15) or spiral. On some lids (Figure 16) the spirals are burnished while the rest of the surface was left rough and cov- ered with a pasty white paint. On one of the smaller lids roughly crescent-shaped incisions form four spi- rals, two winding from each end of the handle to the rim (Figure 17). An unusual lid (Figure 18) is bell- shaped, with the upper part convex and topped by a knob handle, now missing. It is decorated with deep horizontal fluting on the entire surface. Although this shape is rare in Gumelnitza pottery, the fluted and in- cised decoration is characteristic of the culture. Two of the three high-shouldered piriform vases in this group are blackened by smoke so that most of their yellowish brown slip has disappeared (Figure 19). Both have thick walls and are decorated with modeled strips running diagonally from shoulder to base. On the smaller vase the strips are double and were probably traced with two fingers in the wet clay; on the large one the single strips are broader and are confined to the upper part of the body, each ending in a knob below. The third vase (Figure 20), a sort of tureen, has on the shoulder four evenly spaced groups of three knobs and three carelessly impressed rows of "brackets" ; this pattern is typical of the Gumelnitza culture in all its stages. One of the bowls (Figure 21) - now broken and distorted - belongs to a series of large carinated bowls. It is covered with a red burnished slip and the whole exterior has well marked flutings in the form of two double spirals running from the rim to the base; the areas between are filled with modeled flut- ing, so that none of the surface remains undecorated. A few small bowls without decoration were also found. These have very thick walls and are shaped like truncated cones. Another shape is a rhyton, or drinking vessel, shaped like a curved horn; a handle extends from the 168</page><page sequence="8">15. Knobbed lid with concentric fluting.

The decoration consists of two rows of incised triangles filled with fine incisions and outlined by small punctures. This shape occurs fre- quently in the Gumelnitza culture as well as in neigh- boring contemporary cultures ; it must be directly con- nected with similar vessels in Asia Minor and the Aegean regions. Apart from this local pottery, undoubtedly pro- duced on the spot (although no trace of a kiln has yet been found) a few imported vessels were also found in 1963. Two of these which could be restored, as well as a few fragments, belong to the Cucuteni cul- ture. One of these vases is the broken one in which the small graphite-painted bowls were found (Figure 23). Not only the polychrome decoration (applied before firing) but also the clay and the way it was fired are typical of the Cucuteni culture. The outside was painted red all over and burnished; afterwards the vase was painted in white and the designs were reserved in red. All the motifs are outlined in black, producing the polychromy which is characteristic of Cucuteni phase A. Another imported vessel is a large cup (Figure 24) of a very fine clay peculiar to Cucuteni pottery, well fired to a red color. Polychrome painting covers both exterior and interior. The background is reddish- brown; on this white spirals are painted. On the out- side the paint is thicker, hence better preserved; in- side the paint has become transparent, acquiring a rosy shade. The painting technique, somewhat different from that of the first vase, is also characteristic of Cucuteni wares. After the white ribbon designs were painted on the background, the surrounding space was painted dark red, sometimes up to the white ribbons, sometimes leaving narrow spaces ; finally, black-brown lines were used to border the designs. The red parts were burnished but the white and the black painted areas were not. Other fragments of Cucuteni (phase A) painted pottery include a typical knob from a lid, a few sherds of vessels and what seems to be the foot of a high- footed cup. As for other objects found in the dwelling, there is a fragment of a marble bowl which was probably in the shape of a truncated cone, with two holes perhaps for making a repair. 'Such marble bowls, occasionally found at Gumelnitza settlements, must be connected with the southern Balkan peninsula and the Aegean area, where marble vessels are earlier, more varied in shape and more numerous. A fragment of a tool made of an antler - perhaps a hoe - was found; this has a roughly rectangular hole for inserting the handle. There are several tools of brown flint, blades with rough edges and scrapers with retouched edges, which are common in the cul- ture. Eighteen weights of baked clay were found, some of them with incised decoration on the base (Figure 25). An object of unknown purpose is a sort of cube of baked clay pierced from side to side by in- tersecting holes (Figure 26) . The only example of plastic art found in the dwell- ing, aside from the figure with the vase on its head, is a fragment of a male statuette of blackish-gray clay (Figure 27). In addition to these objects, there are many sherds of various wares - large provision jars and vessels of various sizes but too fragmentary to re- store - all within the range of the Gumelnitza wares. Before concluding, it should be pointed out that the circumstances of discovery prove without any possible doubt that the dwelling discovered in 1963 and all the objects in it belong to phase B of the Gumelnitza culture. This means that all the characteristics of the pottery must be considered as specific for that phase. After the first excavations we thought that graphite- painted pottery was peculiar to an earlier phase of the Gumelnitza culture, but the presence of a great number of such vessels in the dwelling excavated in 1963 proves that at least in some settlements this form of decoration was frequent in phase B as well as earlier. Crusted ware also is common in phase B, as is polychrome ware, which is rare before then. This raises the problem of possible influences on the Gumelnitza culture, as local tradition alone is in- sufficient to account for the presence of polychromy. We are inclined to attribute it to the influence of Cucuteni painted pottery, all the more so since several vessels of this ware were found in the dwelling ex- cavated in 1963. Still, in view of the fact that crusted ware was made long before this, from the earliest phase of the Gumelnitza culture, and that it occurs also in the Boian culture (immediately preceding Gu- melnitza), we should be cautious in our statements. Moreover, there are chronological problems connected with the presence of Cucuteni vases at Gumelnitza, which will be discussed below. Another type of pottery - with fluted decoration - which was found in some quantity in 1963 confirms the opinion we formed in 1925, namely, that fluted decoration is peculiar to Gumelnitza phase B. The other kinds of decoration and shapes found are also common in this phase; the small biconical vessels especially occur at all sites of the Gumelnitza culture. 171</page><page sequence="11">GUMELNITZA continued The presence of the Cucuteni painted ware is very important not only for the relationship between the two cultures but also for their relative chronology. This problem has been discussed in detail elsewhere; hence we shall only summarize here. Until recently archaeologists believed that Gumelnitza phase A was generally contemporary with Cucuteni phase A and the beginning of phase A-B, while Gumelnitza B was considered contemporary with the latter part of Cucuteni A-B and Cucuteni C. But during the last ten years the discovery of some pre-Cucuteni and Cucuteni pottery in Gumelnitza settlements in Muntenia led to the conclusion that the last pre-Cucuteni phase in Moldavia was contemporary not only with the last Boian phase in Muntenia but also with the earliest Gumelnitza phase; therefore the Gumelnitza culture arose before the appearance of Cucuteni. This further suggested that the Gumelnitza culture was one of the factors that determined the change from pre-Cucuteni to Cucuteni culture. On the other hand, the presence of polychrome Cucuteni vessels of phase A (actually A3) in sites belonging to Gumelnitza phases A2 and B1 leads logically to the conclusion that Cucuteni A3 was contemporary with Gumelnitza A2 and Bj. This means that the following stage of the Cucuteni cul- ture (phase A-B) must have been contemporary with the later Gumelnitza Bx stage, and that the final phase of the painted pottery (Cucuteni B) was contemporary with the last stage (B2) of Gumelnitza, wherever it developed, and with the first phase of the Cernavoda culture. The relationship may be presented in sche- matic form: Pre-Cucuteni = Gumelnitza Ax Cucuteni A1 and A2 = Gumelnitza ArA2 Cucuteni A3 = Gumelnitza A2-Bi Cucuteni A-B = Gumelnitza later B1 Cucuteni B = Gumelnitza B2 and Cernavoda 1 The Cernavoda culture developed south and east of the Danube ; its people afterwards crossed the Danube in a relatively small area, where they put an end to the further development of the Gumelnitza culture. With regard to absolute chronology, the problem is rather difficult, on the one hand because we possess too few radiocarbon dates and, on the other, because some of these dates are difficult to accept. In any case, it is certain that the discoveries of Gumelnitza de- scribed above and the whole early stage of phase B belong in the third millennium b.c., most probably in its second half. The few dates obtained by radiocar- bon for Gumelnitza phase A2 indicate the second half of the fourth millennium, so it is only natural to place phase B in the following millennium, although its exact duration is unknown. It is certain, however, that this phase could have lasted to 2000 b.c., when the transition period to the Bronze Age begins. In our regions the Bronze Age could not have begun before 1800-1700 B.c., in contrast to the southern regions of the Balkan peninsula, where the beginning of the Bronze Age may be placed in the third millennium. As to the origin of polychromy in the Gumelnitza culture (as it is found on the vessels described, with the patterns bordered by lines) we are inclined to think that it may be ascribed to the influence of the neighboring Cucuteni culture. Still, this influence and even the example provided by the imported Cucuteni pottery did not induce the Gumelnitza people to adopt this technique for their polychrome painting: as we see, they used the crusted technique for polychrome ware. This might seem rather surprising, as the Gu- melnitza people knew the technique of painting be- fore firing, but they used it only for graphite painting. The most recent discoveries at Gumelnitza, as well as all we know about this culture, which existed in southern Rumania and Bulgaria, show the high level of craftsmanship possessed by these tribes. Joining local tradition to new cultural elements borrowed from Anatolia and the Aegean and at the same time receiving influences from neighboring tribes, they succeeded in achieving a cultural synthesis of high artistic value in pottery-making as well as in clay plastic art. Along with the Cucuteni painted pottery culture, the Gumelnitza culture may be considered one of the superior Late Neolithic cultures on the lower Danube and in the Balkans. The type site of Gumel- nitza is rightly considered one of the most important of that period within the whole of southeast Europe. Though the upper level was greatly damaged by farming during the last century, the deeper layers no doubt still hide treasures which will be brought to light by further digging on a large scale.
