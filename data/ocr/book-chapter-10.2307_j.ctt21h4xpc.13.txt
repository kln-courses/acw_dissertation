<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Reasons for the Commandments in  Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed and in  Provençal Jewish Philosophy Introduction In the introduction to the Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides sets  forth the purpose of his treatise and adds the following remark: I do not think that anyone possessing an unimpaired capacity imag- ines that the words of the Torah referred to here that one contrives  to understand through understanding the meaning of parables, are  ordinances concerning the building of Tabernacle, the lulab, and the  law of four trustees. Rather what this text has in view here is,  without any doubt, the understanding of obscure matters. (11)1 The “obscure matters” mentioned by Maimonides apparently refer to  the “secrets of the Torah,” which he equates with the natural and  metaphysical sciences.2 He thereby clarifies from the outset of his  1 All English translations of the Guide are taken from the translation of Shlomo  Pines (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1963). All other translations in this  chapter are my own. 2 Maimonides identifies these sciences with the “work of creation” and “work of the  chariot”; see Guide, introduction; Mishneh Torah, Laws of Principles of the Torah,  chapters 1-4. See above, chapter 7, 229. </page> <page sequence="2"> 362 Chapter Ten treatise that he does not regard the commandments as allegories  belonging to these secrets. They are to be understood in a literal  manner. The most detailed listing of the secrets of the Torah is  presented by Maimonides in Guide 1.35. They include a discussion of  the divine attributes and the way they should be negated as pertaining  to God, the meaning of the attributes that may be ascribed to God, a  discussion of the creation of what God has created, the character of  divine governance of the world, the manner of divine providence, the  notions of divine will and divine knowledge, the notion of prophecy  and its various degrees, and the meaning of the divine names. In the  course of the Guide, Maimonides deals with all these topics. The  esotericists among his interpreters have looked for his hidden views  specifically in his discussions of these topics, attempting to show that  his true position in these matters essentially conforms to that of the  Aristotelian philosophers.3 On some of these issues, Maimonides  expresses his agreement with the philosophers’ world view explicitly.  Divine governance of the world is one prominent example.4 More  important for our purpose are those topics that are treated promi- nently in the Guide that are not on Maimonides’ list, particularly the  two topics that conclude the Guide—the reasons for the command- ments and human perfection.5 Maimonides devotes well over half of  the third part of the Guide to these two topics. Why so much attention  3 The topics of creation, prophecy, and providence in particular have been the focus  of attempts to show that Maimonides hints to his essential agreement with the  Aristotelian view. For a summary of the divergent interpretations of Maimonides  on these issues, see Howard Kreisel, “Moses Maimonides,” in History of Jewish  Philosophy, ed. Daniel H. Frank and Oliver Leaman (London: Routledge, 1997),  256-272. For a survey of the esoteric interpretations of Maimonides’ philosophy,  see Aviezer Ravitzky, “The Secrets of the Guide of the Perplexed: Between the  Thirteenth and the Twentieth Centuries,” in Studies in Maimonides, ed. Isadore  Twersky (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990), 159-207. See also  above, chapter 3. 4 Maimonides writes in Guide 2.6: 265: “There is then nothing in what Aristotle for  his part has said about this subject that is not in agreement with the Law.” 5 These topics are not the only ones treated by Maimonides that are not on his list of  the “secrets of the Torah.” Maimonides also devotes a detailed discussion in the  Guide to the proofs for the existence of God and the problem of evil. It may be  argued, however, that these topics are subsumed into other ones that are mentioned,  namely divine attributes and divine providence. </page> <page sequence="3"> The Reasons for the Commandments  363 is paid to topics whose discussion is apparently not part of the explicit  purpose of the treatise invites further investigation. While Maimonides indicates that the commandments are not  “obscure matters” that should be understood allegorically, thus  suggesting the view that no esoteric doctrines are involved in his  presentation of them,6 his approach to the commandments in Guide  3.25-49 has been the cause of more than a little perplexity. On some  points Maimonides appears to present contradictory positions and even  allusions to an esoteric doctrine, as shown by his medieval commenta- tors as well as his modern ones. For example, Maimonides argues in  Guide 3:26 that the particulars of the commandments may not always  have a specific reason but may be arbitrary, one of his examples being  the specific type of animal chosen for a particular sacrifice, while in  3.46 he offers explanations why particular animals were chosen for  certain sacrifices.7 Another example is Maimonides’ apparently esoteric  view on the nature of Oral Law, which emerges from a close reading of  3.41.8 To these two examples we may add positions presented in the  Guide that appear to contradict his position in earlier works, such as his  positive evaluation of asceticism in 3.48 and his treatment there of the  Nazarite as a holy individual due to his abstinence, while regarding the  Nazarite as a sinner in Eight Chapters, 4 for abstaining from permitted  6 See, however, Isadore Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (New  Haven: Yale University Press, 1980) 397-400. Twersky argues that this topic belongs  to the secrets of the Torah in Maimonides’ thought, but he provides only indirect  evidence in support of this conclusion. It should be noted that this topic is essen- tially different than the ones mentioned explicitly by Maimonides. They deal with  being and with the foundations of nature, thus corresponding to the subject matter  of the theoretical sciences in Aristotelian philosophy. The reasons for the command- ments belong more to the domain of political philosophy, which is a practical  science. 7 See Josef Stern, Problems and Parables of Law (Albany: State University of New  York Press, 1998), 30-31. 8 Maimonides’ discussion suggests that the Oral Law was not received by Moses  together with the Written Law but developed later. For a discussion of this issue,  see Jacob Levinger, “On the Oral Law in Maimonides’ Thought,” Tarbiz 37 (1968):  282-293 (Heb.) [reprinted in his Maimonides as Philosopher and Codifier (Jerusalem:  Bialik Institute, 1989), 100-111]. </page> <page sequence="4"> 364 Chapter Ten pleasures.9 Further examples may also be adduced.10 These problematic  issues notwithstanding, there appears to be nothing esoteric about the  gist of Maimonides’ approach. All commandments have a purpose or  telos. They are designed to promote either true beliefs or the social  welfare of the body politic, what Maimonides terms “the welfare of the  soul” and “the welfare of the body.”11 In this manner they create an  ideal environment for the pursuit of individual perfection, what  Maimonides labels the “perfection of the soul,” which is essentially the  perfection of the intellect in its apprehension of all truths that the  human intellect is capable of grasping regarding being.12 Performance of  the commandments accrues no benefit to God or to any of the existents  above humanity in the hierarchy of being. Nor do the commandments  have any magical-mystical effects on the soul that are closed to the  discernment of human reason. The manner they mold a person’s char- acter traits can be grasped by a close examination of the activities they  command or prohibit in conjunction with knowledge of Aristotelian  ethics. In this chapter I would like to make a number of observations  regarding Maimonides’ approach to the reasons for the command- ments, then turn to the treatment of this topic among some of his  followers in Provence, particularly Levi ben Avraham, and conclude by  returning to the place of this topic in the Guide. Characteristics of Maimonides’ Approach to the  Reasons for the Commandments The fundamental premise upon which Maimonides bases his discus- sion of the reasons for the commandments is that they all were  legislated for a good reason, for God does nothing in vain.13 Their   9 I have dealt with this issue in “Asceticism in the Thought of R. Baḥya Ibn Paquda  and Maimonides,” Daat 21 (1988): 5-22. 10 Maimonides apparently contradictory positions regarding commandments that  appear to involve cruelty to animals, such as sending away the mother bird before  taking her young, has also been discussed by scholars; see for example Stern, Prob- lems and Parables of Law, 49-55, 63-66. 11 See Guide 3.27. 12 For a discussion of this issue, see Howard Kreisel, Maimonides’ Political Thought  (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1999), 166-170, 189-193. 13 Guide 3.25. </page> <page sequence="5"> The Reasons for the Commandments  365 ultimate purpose is to promote human perfection, which consists of  the perfection of the intellect, which in turn requires living in a well  ordered society. The latter goal is achieved by legislating laws that  prevent the inhabitants of society from wronging each other and more  importantly, that inculcate moral virtues which contribute to social  harmony or the wellbeing of the body politic (as well as to the well- being of the body and soul of the individual). The former goal is  advanced by inculcating true beliefs as well as actions that reinforce  them or are designed to counter false beliefs.14 One of the most well  known characteristics of Maimonides’ approach is the historical-an- thropological reasons he presents for many of the commandments.  According to his reading of history, the idolatrous religions of old  posed the greatest obstacle to the welfare of the soul and its perfec- tion, as well as to the welfare of the body, that is to say, social morality.  It is for this reason that the Torah’s first goal is to eradicate idolatry,  both its beliefs and the ritual practices that reinforce these beliefs.15  Many of the commandments are the immediate product of the Torah’s  campaign to put an end to these beliefs and practices. Ironically, the  very success of the Torah in this area is why we no longer understand  the reasons for many of the commandments. The books purportedly  describing the ancient religion of the Sabians, foremost among them  the Nabatean Agriculture, provide Maimonides with his critical  insights into some of the Torah’s more esoteric commandments,  particularly those belonging to the realm of agriculture and to the  order of sacrifice.16 14 Ibid. 3.27. 15 Ibid. 3.29-30. 16 Worthy of note is Maimonides’ concluding remarks to his discussion of the reasons  for the commandments in ibid. 3.49: 612:  In the case of most of the statutes whose reason is hidden from us, everything  serves to keep people away from idolatry. The fact that there are particulars the  reason for which is hidden from me and the utility of which I do not understand,  is due to the circumstance that things known by hearsay are not like things that one  has seen. Hence the extent of my knowledge of the ways of the Sabians drawn from  books is not comparable to the knowledge of one who saw their practices with his  eyes. . . . If we knew the particulars of those practices and heard details concerning  those opinions, we would become clear regarding the wisdom manifested in the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 366 Chapter Ten A corollary of Maimonides’ historical-anthropological approach is  his view that many of the commandments reflect a form of historical  compromise. The order of sacrifice in its entirety is the result of such a  compromise, since it allows the Israelites to continue to practice the  form of worship to which they were accustomed. At the same time it  weans them away from idolatrous beliefs and practices by changing the  details of the practice and directing all sacrifices to the true deity  instead of false gods. In Guide 3.32, Maimonides categorizes the  commandments involving the sacrifices as belonging to the “second  intention” of the Torah, namely commandments not laid down for  their own sake since they do not contribute directly to a person’s  perfection. Sacrifices do not constitute the ideal form of worship that  lead most directly to a true apprehension of God, at least on the level  appropriate for society as a whole. In promulgating the Law, God takes  under consideration the fact that it is harder to uproot ritual practices  than the beliefs they are designed to support. The basic practices must  be maintained while attaching them to new beliefs. Otherwise the  people will continue to hold on to the old practices, the promulgation  of newer forms of worship by the Law notwithstanding, together with  the idolatrous beliefs associated with them. While sacrifices are coun- tenanced for this reason, God at the same time limits their practice in  time and place and attempts to accustom the Israelites to the more  superior form of worship, prayer, upon which the Law does not place  the same limitations.17 As is the case with all legislations, the Law  addresses a certain social reality and is framed from the standpoint of  what is possible to achieve in a given situation. details of the practices prescribed in the commandments concerning the sacrifices  and the forms of uncleanness and other matters whose reason cannot, to my mind,  be easily grasped. 17 Ibid. 3.32. It is important to note that Maimonides regards prayer as a Torah  commandment and not a rabbinic ordinance. This view not only is in harmony  with his philosophical approach but also reflects the dominant view of the Geonim.  For a study of this issue, see in particular Gerald Blidstein, Prayer in Maimonidean  Halakha (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1994), 23-68 (Heb.). On prayer in Maimon- ides’ thought and how it contrasts to sacrifices see below, chapter 11, 403-406. </page> <page sequence="7"> The Reasons for the Commandments  367 The notion of viewing many commandments as a result of histor- ical compromise is certainly problematic from a religious standpoint.  Gershom Scholem goes directly to the heart of the issue in the intro- ductory essay to Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism: For a purely historical understanding of religion, Maimonides’ anal- ysis of the origin of the mitzvot, the religious commandments, is of  great importance, but he would be a bold man who would maintain  that his theory of the mitzvot was likely to increase the enthusiasm  of the faithful for their actual practice, likely to augment their imme- diate appeal to religious feeling. If the prohibition against seething a  kid in its mother’s milk and many similar irrational commandments  are explicable as polemics against long-forgotten pagan rites, if the  offering of sacrifice is a concession to the primitive mind, if other  mitzvot carry with them antiquated moral and philosophical ideas— how can one expect the community to remain faithful to practices of  which the antecedents have long since disappeared or of which the  aims can be attained directly through philosophical reasoning? To  the philosopher, the Halakah either had no significance at all, or one  that was calculated to diminish rather than to enhance its prestige in  his eyes.18 It would also be a bold individual who would argue that there is  no truth in Scholem’s critique of Maimonides’ approach. Scholem  employs his critique to explain the more attractive solution offered by  the kabbalists in winning hearts and minds in the battle to uphold  Jewish law and lore. It is not incidental that Scholem bases this  critique on Maimonides’ approach in the Guide. As already been  noted by scholars such as Isadore Twersky, Maimonides’ approach to  the reasons for the commandments in the Guide differs from the  approach that may be gleamed from the Mishneh Torah.19 In the Guide,  the question that Maimonides seeks to answer is: why did God  command these particular commandments, what is the divine motive?  In the Mishneh Torah, on the other hand, Maimonides is more  concerned with providing reasons that would add to one’s devotion.  18 See Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken  Publishing House, 1941), 29. 19 Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides, 430-439. </page> <page sequence="8"> 368 Chapter Ten The question he answers in those passages in the Mishneh Torah in  which he provides reasons for the commandments is how one  observing the commandments should view them. A religious existen- tial perspective is adopted in this work.20 These two perspectives—  that which views the commandments from the standpoint of the  reason God commands them and that which focuses on how one  should regard the commandments while observing them—often  overlap and there is no inherent contradiction between them.  Maimonides himself adopts an existential approach to the command- ments in Guide 3.51 while dealing with the form of worship appropriate  to those striving for intellectual perfection. Nevertheless, these two  approaches create different impressions on the mind of the reader, as  is Maimonides’ intent. Even in confining oneself to Maimonides’ approach in the Guide to  commandments belonging to the “second intention,” one discerns that  his approach is not as one-dimensional as the critique of it suggests.  The novelty and radical nature of his historical-anthropological  approach to sacrifices has overshadowed the other dimensions of  Maimonides’ approach to this topic. As we have seen above, according  to Maimonides’ discussion of the “second intention” of the Law, the  reason for the limitations in time and place governing the offering of  sacrifices is due to the inferior nature of this type of worship. Yet in  Maimonides’ subsequent discussion one finds a positive value placed  upon some of these limitations. Consider what Maimonides writes, for  example, in 3.47, while discussing the stringent limitations placed  upon the entry to the Sanctuary: We have already explained that the whole intention with regard to  the Sanctuary was to affect those that came to it with a feeling of awe  and of fear, as it says: Ye shall fear My Sanctuary [Leviticus 19:30].  Now if one is continually in contact with a venerable object, the  impression received from it in the soul diminishes and the feeling it  provokes becomes slight. (593) 20 See in particular the example of Maimonides’ different treatments of the laws of  impurity brought by Twersky, ibid., 435. </page> <page sequence="9"> The Reasons for the Commandments  369 If familiarity breeds contempt, as Maimonides appears to argue,  severely limiting certain practices insures that they remain awe-in- spiring. Here too there is no inherent contradiction between Maimonides’  different positions on this issue. The limitations on sacrifice may serve a  twofold purpose: they are designed to create the feeling of awe while at  the same time encourage the individual to become accustomed to the  more frequent and superior form of worship, namely prayer. Yet  Maimonides’ discussion of the Sanctuary in Guide 3.47 reveals a far  more nuanced approach to sacrifices as a mode of worship than the  general view he expresses in 3.32. This is further underlined by the  allegorical explanation he offers for aspects of the service in the Sanc- tuary as well as for some of the sacrifices in his discussion in Guide  3.46, as we shall see below. Reasons for the Commandments in Provençal  Jewish Philosophy Given the dominant influence Maimonides’ approach in the Guide exer- cised on most of the subsequent medieval Jewish philosophers, it is not  without justification that Scholem views it as the medieval Jewish philo- sophical approach. This enables Scholem to treat Maimonides’ view of  the reasons for the commandments, particularly what must be regarded  from many perspectives as its most problematic aspect, as reflecting the  view of the medieval Jewish philosophers in general. Yet historical reality  never fits neatly into the categories we create to describe it. It is not only  Scholem who finds Maimonides’ approach wanting on this issue; the  same is true of many of Maimonides’ most avid followers, particularly  those who lived in Provence for the century and a half following his  death. Samuel Ibn Tibbon, the translator of the Guide, started exploring  the problem of the reasons for the commandments by focusing on some  whose reason Maimonides did not adequately address in his view.21  21 Samuel Ibn Tibbon wrote a short treatise on the reason for the table with the  loaves of bread that are placed in the Sanctuary, as well as for the candlestick. The  motivation for writing this treatise is Maimonides’ admission that he does not  know the reason for this commandment; see Guide 3.45. Ibn Tibbon explains how  both commandments are designed to combat the notion that God is corporeal. See  MS Oxford 1252, 335a-337b. </page> <page sequence="10"> 370 Chapter Ten His son-in-law, Jacob Anatoli, delves into the topic of the reasons for the  commandments in more detail in his book of sermons, Malmad ha-Talmi- dim.22 Some of the later thirteenth-century and early fourteenth-century  thinkers, such as Levi ben Avraham,23 David ben Samuel HaKokhavi,24  22 Ed. L. Silberman (Lyck: Mekize Nirdamim, 1866). 23 For a discussion of Levi and his encyclopedia Livyat Ḥen, see above, chapter 5. 24 See Sefer ha-Batim, vol. 2 (Sefer Mizvah), Moshe Hershler (ed.) (Jerusalem: Makhon  Shalem, 1983).   Sefer ha-Batim, or Kiryat Sefer as the treatise was called by the author, is for the  most part a legal work, in fact one of the most ambitious legal works ever written.  Like Maimonides’ code, and in fact building upon it, HaKokhavi deals with all  topics of Jewish law, whether relevant to his own period or not, but unlike the  Mishneh Torah, HaKokhavi cites his medieval sources, brings divergent opinions,  and introduces a different method of organization. Most of this early four- teenth-century treatise is lost, while the few surviving parts have been published.  Prior to writing his legal compendium, HaKokhavi wrote a different treatise enti- tled Migdal David (The Tower of David), which he then appended to the beginning  of his legal compendium. This treatise consists of two parts, the first devoted to  a detailed discussion of the principles of Judaism—HaKokhavi brings seven such  principles: creation, free will, providence, Torah from heaven, reward and  punishment, the coming of the messiah, and resurrection of the dead. The second  part is an in-depth discussion of the rationale underlying each of the 613  commandments. The core of the treatise, the legal section, is divided into three  parts, with each part subdivided into “houses” (batim), consisting of different  categories of commandments (in total, 12 categories). In the introduction to  Kiryat Sefer, HaKokhavi describes the mutual relation between the two sections  of his combined treatise. The tower—knowledge of the principles of Judaism— defends the city, that is, the religion, against all its enemies who wish to destroy  it, while the residents of the city supply the defenders of the tower with their  nourishment, that is, knowledge of all the commandments.

Maimonides’ approach disturbed these thinkers not only for exis- tential-spiritual reasons, but also for theological ones. Why would God  promulgate eternal commandments whose rationale was not eternal?  True, they remain much more modest in their approach than the  kabbalists who begin to flourish in the same period. They do not create  narratives that place the commandments in the context of a cosmic  struggle in which God’s power could be augmented by their practice.28  For them, as for Maimonides, God is the Unmoved Mover. God does  not become emotional, let alone stronger or weaker, by what a person  puts in his mouth, for example, or by what comes out of it. Humanity,  both as individuals and as a collective, is the realm to which an under- 25 For a discussion of Nissim and his treatise Ma‘aseh Nissim, see above, chapter 6. 26 This topic is almost, though not quite, completely absent from Gersonides’ philo- sophic magnum opus, The Wars of the Lord, but as is only fitting occupies much of  his attention throughout his Torah commentary. For a discussion of Gersonides’  approach to the commandments, see Isaac Heinemann, The Reasons for the  Commandments in Jewish Literature (Jerusalem: The Jewish Agency Press, 1966),  97-102 (Heb.); Charles Touati, La pensée philosophique et théologique de Gersonide  (Paris: Les Éditions de Minuit, 1973), 492-505. 27 Mention should also be made of the Torah commentary of the late-thirteenth-cen- tury Spanish kabbalist, Baḥya ben Asher. Baḥya’s commentary is replete with  philosophical explanations of many of the commandments, many of whose sources  have not been identified. It is clear that Baḥya had at his disposal philosophical  sources that are no longer available to us. Some may have been the product of the  Jewish philosophers of Provence. There is evidence, for example, that some of the  writings of Moses Ibn Tibbon, the son of Samuel Ibn Tibbon, have not survived  and that they dealt in part with the subject of the commandments. This evidence  is based on references by Moses Ibn Tibbon in his Sefer ha-Pe’ah to these works, as  well as references by Levi in his Livyat Ḥen. A number of the references allude to  matters pertaining to the commandments; see my introduction to The Writings of  R. Moshe Ibn Tibbon, ed. Howard Kreisel, Colette Sirat, and Avraham Israel (Beer- Sheva: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press, 2010), 9-35 (Heb.); see also  above, chapter 4, 93, 111. 28 For a study of kabbalistic approaches to the commandments see Daniel Matt, “The  Mystic and the Mizwot,” in Jewish Spirituality, I, ed. Arthur Green (New York:  Crossroad Press, 1986), 367-404. Frank Talmage contrasts philosophic and kabbal- istic approaches along different lines, focusing on the allegorical interpretation of  the commandments employed by the philosophers as against the symbolic interpre- tation of the kabbalists; see Frank Talmage, Apples of Gold in Settings of Silver, ed.  Barry Walfish (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1999), 132-139. </page> <page sequence="12"> 372 Chapter Ten standing of the reasons for the commandments is to be limited. They  also share with Maimonides his fundamental belief that all command- ments are essentially rational, that is understandable, from a human  perspective, with the Aristotelian world view in its medieval form lying  at the heart of their approaches. While Maimonides’ historical-anthro- pological approach is not ignored by them or even dismissed, one can  detect a recurring attempt to supplement this approach with reasons  that are divorced from the vicissitudes of history and would not lose  their luster over time. Naturalistic reasons figure prominently in the Provençal Jewish  philosophers’ approaches to the commandments just as they do in Maimon- ides’ approach. Maimonides explains certain prohibitions, such as  forbidden foods, as being laid down in order to prevent harm to one’s  body. Blood for example is forbidden because of the damage it causes  to the digestive system. He also regards pork as harmful despite the fact  that he knows that not all medical authorities share this opinion.29  While Maimonides does not view circumcision as being commanded  for physical health reasons,30 but to serve as a physical sign uniting all  those committed to the monotheistic idea, he also regards it as  decreasing sexual desires. This plays a crucial role in the pursuit of  moral and intellectual perfection.31 Yet Maimonides at times breaks with a naturalistic framework for  understanding the commandments. He suggests miraculous explana- tions for some of them. In Guide 3.47, for example, he writes: As for the uncleanness of leprosy, we have already explained its  meaning. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, have also  29 See Guide 3.48. For a discussion of this issue, see Levinger, Maimonides as Philoso- pher and Codifier, 112-124. 30 Such a reason would suggest that there is a lack of physical perfection in God’s  creation, since man is born with a superfluous part. Thus God’s creation could not  be regarded as the most perfect one possible. The same theological problem does  not hold true with regard to moral defects, for the nature of the human being  requires the striving for moral and intellectual perfection and not its possession  from the outset. 31 Guide 3.49.

They have made known to us that the established prin- ciple in regard to it is that it is a punishment for slander and that at  first this change appears in the walls. If the man repents, the purpose  has been achieved. . . . If he still persists in his disobedience, it  passes over to his clothing, then to his body. This is a miracle that  was perpetuated in the religious community like that of the waters of  the woman suspected of adultery. (597) How committed is Maimonides to an understanding of the leprosy  mentioned in the Torah as a miraculous phenomenon, or to the mirac- ulous effectiveness of the water administered to a woman suspected of  adultery in establishing her guilt, is an open question.32 In the continu- ation of his remarks in 3.48, he notes that leprosy is a contagious  disease, a fact that suggests the tie drawn between leprosy and slander  as not literal but metaphoric. In 3.49, he presents sociological and  psychological reasons in reference to most of the other details of the  ceremony of the woman accused of adultery. It is noteworthy that he  posits an ongoing miracle in reference to the salient feature of this  commandment. In this manner, Maimonides’ approach to the command- ments mirrors his approach to the divine governance of the world in  general.33 While the object of Maimonides’ discussion is to instill in his  readers a greater appreciation of God’s governance of the world through  the order of nature, and to limit the importance and extent of the  miraculous, he nevertheless understands the theological importance of  allowing for the occurrence of miracles. Similarly, his discussion of the  commandments is designed to show how they further the natural ends  of humanity in a manner that conforms to the order of nature, but at  the same time reflect some of the supernaturalistic aspects of divine  activity. 32 This problem belongs to the more general one of Maimonides’ approach to mira- cles, specifically whether he accepts the view of God’s direct intervention in events  of the world or is secretly committed to a completely naturalistic understanding of  all phenomena. For a discussion of this issue, see my “Miracles in Medieval Jewish  Philosophy,” JQR 75 (1984): 101-114; see also above, chapter 9, 354-360. 33 On the similarity that Maimonides draws between Law and nature, see Guide 3.34,  49. </page> <page sequence="14"> 374 Chapter Ten The Provençal Jewish philosophers tend to expand upon the natu- ralistic approach in understanding the reasons for the commandments,  such as in the case of forbidden foods. They see all these foods as  harmful to one’s health and bring scientific explanations in support of  this position.34 They also extend the naturalistic approach to command- ments that Maimonides sees primarily in terms of a reaction to Sabian  practices. While Maimonides, for example, sees the commandment  prohibiting the mingling of crops (kil’ayim) as combating idolatrous  rites, the Jewish philosophers of Provence supplement this reason with  theological and naturalistic ones. HaKokhavi, after agreeing with  Maimonides’ view, adds: The words of our Sages suggest a different reason for the prohibition  to mingle crops. They said: “You shall observe my decrees [Leviticus  19:19]—the decrees that I decreed in my world—you shall not let  your cattle mate with a different kind” [BT Sanhedrin 60a]. It appears  to me that the intent of this statement is to prohibit us, in accor- dance with the decree of divine wisdom in His world, from creating  a species that is not found in nature, for this would lead to the denial  that all existence is under God’s providence. This denial would also  lead to the corruption of the existents. One who tries by means of  stratagems to create something that is not found in accordance with  the nature of existence in its entirety will think that the world did  not come into existence in accordance to the purpose of one who acts  with intent. I say “the corruption of the existents,” for the conjoining  of one species with another in vegetation or in animals will lead to  the corruption of that species. It will no longer continue to exist and  no longer breed its kind.35 34 See, for example, Malmad ha-Talmidim, 98a-b; Sefer ha-Batim, 379-388; Ma‘aseh  Nissim, 370-372, 378-379; Gersonides’ commentary to Leviticus 11:1-46 (Perushei  Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, volume 3, ed. Jacob Lev Levy [Jerusalem: Mossad HaRav  Kook, 1997], 127-155). 35 Sefer ha-Batim, 402. See also his explanation for the prohibition against wearing  kil’ayim (ibid., 320-321). Among subsequent Jewish philosophers a similar explana- tion appears in Nissim’s Ma‘aseh Nissim, 384, and Gersonides’ commentary to  Leviticus 19:19 (Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, volume 3, 302-303). HaKokhavi’s  explanation appears earlier in Nahmanides’ commentary to Leviticus 19:19, which  may have served as HaKokhavi’s source. Nahmanides too employs naturalistic  reasons where he feels that they are in harmony with the notion of the eternal  validity of the Torah and serve to strengthen one’s commitment to observance.

Nissim argues that the fruit in its first  three years is bad for one’s health. He also presents a good agricultural  reason for this prohibition, based on the fact that most people think  more in terms of short term gains than the long term consequences. As  a result of the commandment, the individual rather than immediately  attempting to multiply the fruits of the true, as would be one’s tendency  and would lead to the tree’s destruction, concentrates instead on  strengthening the tree.37 Health reasons, in addition to the other reasons presented by  Maimonides, are also found among the explanations given by these  philosophers for the commandment of circumcision.38 HaKokhavi  writes: “Circumcision is also a safeguard against some diseases. It is  known by the science of medicine that many diseases occur in those  possessing foreskins that do not occur in those who are circumcised.”39  A similar explanation is presented by Nissim.40 Two other types of explanation, one Maimonides only occasionally  employs and the other he does not present at all, tend to play a promi- nent role in Provençal approaches to this subject. Both these types of  explanation can be traced to a different Spanish Jewish thinker who had  a strong impact on Provençal Jewish philosophy, Abraham Ibn Ezra. The  first type of explanation is the allegoric one. Certain commandments  commandments labeled divine decrees (ḥuqqim), see Stern, Problems and Parables  of Law, 109-160. 36 See Guide 3.37. 37 See Ma‘aseh Nissim, 385-386. Nissim cites Ibn Ezra’s commentary to Leviticus  19:23 as the source of the first reason. Gersonides expands upon this reason in his  commentary to Leviticus 19:23 (Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, volume 3, 304). 38 See Avraham Gross, “Reasons for Circumcision: Trends and Historical Influ- ences,” Daat 21 (1988): 25-46 (Heb.). The philosophers presenting this explanation  ignore the reason for Maimonides’ refusal to introduce the physical health factor in  regard to circumcision. As noted above, this reason suggests a lack of physical  perfection in God’s creation of man, since he is born with a superfluous part that  is a physical liability in addition to being a moral one. 39 Sefer ha-Batim, 72. 40 Ma‘aseh Nissim, 373. </page> <page sequence="16"> 376 Chapter Ten were promulgated with the intention of spurring our thought to focus  on eternal scientific-theological truths or moral ones. In a famous  passage toward the beginning of his commentary on Leviticus, a  passage that appears also in his Yesod Mora, Ibn Ezra explains the  sacrifice of ‘olah (that which goes up), a sacrifice that is burnt  completely, as one that is offered to atone for ha-‘olah ‘al ha-ruaḥ, that  is to say, sinful thoughts.41 Both the name of the sacrifice and the  details concerning it serve to stimulate the person to ponder the indi- vidual’s more noble part and attempt to burn out completely any evil  inclinations. Ibn Ezra’s older contemporary, R. Judah Halevi, is  another Spanish Jewish philosopher whose philosophical treatise was  known to the Jewish philosophers of Provence and who made use of  allegoric explanations in his approach to the commandments. In Kuzari  2.26, he presents an allegoric understanding of the Sanctuary, treating  it as a macro-anthropos.42 Maimonides tends to treat allegoric explanations as nice homilies  rather than part of the original intent of the commandments.43 This  serves to safeguard the commandments themselves from being treated  as allegories rather than actions that one is obligated to perform. Yet it  is not the case that Maimonides denies all allegoric explanations of the  commandments. His explanation of the sin-offering in Guide 3.46, for  example, is primarily of an allegorical nature: As for the burning of the sin-offerings, its purpose was to signify that  the trace of the sin in question was wiped out and had disappeared,  and that no trace remained of that action just as no trace remained  of the sin-offering which was destroyed by having been burnt.  41 See Ibn Ezra’s commentary to Leviticus 1:4, and his Yesod Mora ve-Sod Torah, ed.  Joseph Cohen (Ramat Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 2002), 140. 42 The idea of the Sanctuary as a macro-anthropos is found in Midrash Tanḥuma,  Pequdei 3. While Halevi presents an allegorical interpretation, it appears that he  thinks that the arrangement of the Sanctuary as a macro-anthropos has a theurgic  function—it serves to bring down the spiritual forces from the divine world. The  allegorical explanations of some of the commandments on the part of the Provençal  philosophers, on the other hand, are based on the notion that the commandments  are designed to serve as a prod to contemplate scientific and philosophic truths. 43 This is true for example of the rabbinic explanation for the four species on the  Festival of Tabernacles; see Guide 3.43. </page> <page sequence="17"> The Reasons for the Commandments  377 Consequently, its burning would not offer a sweet odor unto the  Lord. (591) Even more allegorical in nature is Maimonides’ explanation of the  scapegoat in the passage that immediately follows. Maimonides concludes  his explanation with the following remark: No one has any doubt that sins are not bodies that may be trans- ported from the back of one individual to that of another. But all  these actions are parables serving to bring forth a form in the soul so  that a passion toward repentance should result: We have freed  ourselves from all our previous actions, cast them behind our backs,  and removed them to an extreme difference. (Ibid.) The primary reason that Maimonides resorts to allegorical explanation  in these instances in all probability is to avoid the most evident and far  more problematic alternative: namely, magical explanations.44 These  have no place at all in Maimonides’ thought. Maimonides’ ambivalence regarding allegorical explanations can  be detected in the qualified manner he presents the final explanation  of this kind in the chapter: As for the offering of wine, I am up to now perplexed with regard to  it: How could He have commanded to offer it, since the idolaters  offered it? No reason for this has occurred to me. Someone else gave  the following reason: For the desire, which is located in the liver, the  most excellent thing is meat; for the animal faculty, which is located  in the heart, the most excellent thing is wine; similarly the faculty  located in the brain—that is, the psychic faculty—takes pleasure in  songs accompanied by instruments. Therefore every faculty offers to  44 Even more problematic is the explanation that regards the scapegoat as a sacrifice  to the fallen angel Azazel or Azael. This explanation would certainly transform the  commandment into an idolatrous act in Maimonides’ view, though he makes no  allusion to it. The notion that the scapegoat is dedicated to a fallen angel is  preserved in Pirqei de-Rabbi Eliezer, 46, and in Yalqut Shimoni to Genesis 6, no. 44,  a midrash that is known to the Jewish philosophers of Provence; see for example  my edition of Livyat Ḥen: The Work of Creation (Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish  Studies, 2004), 341 (Heb.). The Zohar too builds upon this midrash in explaining  the scapegoat ritual; see Zohar, II, 184b. See also BT Yoma 67b, which transforms  the scapegoat into a form of atonement for the sins of the fallen angels. </page> <page sequence="18"> 378 Chapter Ten God the thing most cherished by it. Accordingly offerings consist in  meat, wine and sound—I mean song. (591-592) This explanation is offered not in Maimonides’ own name and only  because his own most likely explanation for practices concerning sacri- fices fails him in this instance. Why Maimonides offers an explanation  at all in this case is not too difficult to discern. The practices involved  evoke the conception that God enjoys corporeal pleasures. An appro- priate counter-explanation had to be adduced to put the focus of the  commandment back on humanity.45 The allegorical approach to the structure of the Sanctuary and its  service exerted an important influence on the thought of the Jewish  philosophers of Provence. Gersonides, for example, devotes a lengthy  excursus on this subject in his commentary to Exodus 25-27, Lesson 3.46  Building upon Halevi’s approach, Gersonides treats the Sanctuary  both as a macro-anthropos as well as a micro-cosmos. The latter allegor- ical understanding of the Sanctuary figures prominently also in the  commentary of Nissim.47 HaKokhavi expands upon Halevi’s allegorical  explanation of the order of sacrifices and points out the limitations of  Maimonides’ approach in his own discourse on the subject.48 The phys- ical and metaphysical ideas conveyed by the structure of the Sanctuary  and its utensils as depicted by these thinkers are based on Aristotelian  science. While they would seem antiquated to the modern reader, they  represent scientific truths to the rational medieval one. Moreover, many  45 For the same reason, Maimonides repeats in Guide 3.43 the allegoric reason for the  commandment to sound the shofar on the New Year presented in Mishneh Torah,  Laws of Repentance, 3.4. The shofar is designed to awaken us from our spiritu- al-moral slumber and call upon us to examine our deeds and repent. The popular  alternative in this case would be to regard the sounding of the shofar as a way of  awakening the Deity, based on an anthropomorphic conception of God, or as a  means of chasing away Satan and the demons. Maimonides’ explanation provides  a much better alternative to these views from the perspective of his theology. 46 Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, volume 2, ed. Jacob Lev Levy (Jerusalem: Mossad  HaRav Kook, 1997), 361-372.  47 See Ma‘aseh Nissim, 355-358. 48 Sefer ha-Batim, 119-133. HaKokhavi follows Halevi in stressing also the hidden  affects of the order of sacrifice on the soul of the individual. </page> <page sequence="19"> The Reasons for the Commandments  379 of these thinkers were convinced that the basic structure of the world  as conceived by Aristotle came close to being demonstrative. Hence the  truths conveyed by the Sanctuary in their view were eternal ones.  While progress would continue to be made in many important details  of the various sciences, none of these thinkers entertained the notion  that Aristotle’s physics and metaphysics would one day be rejected on  rational grounds.49 The second type of explanation taken from Ibn Ezra, which plays  a prominent role in the approach to the commandments among many of  the Jewish philosophers of Provence, is one that is not advanced at all  by Maimonides. This type of explanation is anchored in what today we  would call the “occult sciences,” but Ibn Ezra would consider them to  be practical sciences—astrology and sciences dealing with the special  properties of objects.50 Ibn Ezra’s treatment of the breastplate (ḥoshen)  worn by the high priest that was employed to answer questions about  whether a certain course of action should be undertaken suggests that  he viewed it as an astrolabe.51 The stones in the breastplate were chosen  for their special properties, for example crystal (aḥlama) for its ability  to induce dreams.52 His understanding of some of the laws of incest is  49 When Scholem criticizes the philosophers’ approach by pointing out that their  explanations of some of the mitzvot “carry with them antiquated moral and  philosophical ideas,” he is guilty of an anachronism. It is of considerable historical  irony that many of the kabbalistic explanations are the product of an imaginative  reworking of many of the same philosophical and ethical views maintained by the  medieval Aristotelian philosophers. The fact that these explanations continue to be  regarded by so many as timeless appears to reflect the victory of imagination over  intellect. 50 For the most in-depth treatment of the place of astrology in Ibn Ezra’s thought, see  Shlomo Sela, Astrology and Biblical Exegesis in Abraham Ibn Ezra’s Thought  (Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1999) (Heb.); see also Y.

Avoiding activity  during this period is a way to protect us from the negative effects of  these planets.54 Other examples can be brought along these lines. Many Provençal Jewish philosophers, if not most, were more  inclined to take their cue from Ibn Ezra on these matters than from  Maimonides. The astrological significance some of the command- ments—e.g., the Sabbath being ruled by two evil planets, making a  cessation from work highly advisable,55 identifying the breastplate  worn by the High Priest as an astrolabe—is a theme that recurs in the  writings of a number of thinkers. They viewed these explanations as  naturalistic ones, while conceding that the scientific reasons for the  efficacy of certain practices and objects are not always understood.  Often they can to be discerned only by experience. This is not unlike  the practical science of medicine, particularly regarding the efficacy of  many drugs.56 Halevi had already employed the medical analogy, God  being the expert physician, to explain the beneficial effects of the  Divine Law in contrast to other legislations.57 He appears to have in  mind the direct influence of the commandments on the soul in a manner  indiscernible by human reason. This is seen in his description of the  salutary effects sacrifices have on the soul, often in complete opposition  to the expectations of reason.58 The explanations offered by some of the  Provençal Jewish philosophers are less mystical and more scientific in  nature. Many of the commandments whose reasons are not easily  understood are seen as affecting one’s physical disposition, which in  53 See Ibn Ezra’s commentary to Leviticus 18:26; Deuteronomy 31:16. 54 See Howard Kreisel, “The Sabbath in Medieval Jewish Philosophy: From the  Supernatural to the Natural,” in Sabbath: Idea History Reality, ed.

The incense burnt in the Sanc- tuary, for example, is seen as purifying the vapors that enter the body,  helping to sharpen one’s intellect and induce prophecy. Music too helps  to create the proper balance between the humors necessary for receiving  this emanation. In general, the offering of sacrifice in connected with  the praxis of attaining prophecy.59 Even commandments that suggest supernatural divine interven- tion are given naturalistic explanations by at least some of the Provençal  philosophers. Nissim, the most radical naturalist among this group,  offers a naturalistic explanation to explain the efficacy of the unusual  ceremony to which a woman suspected of adultery is subjected in order  to reveal whether she in fact is guilty of the crime, as well as how the  adulterer also suffers his just punishment.60 Moreover, no allusion is  made to leprosy as a supernatural disease for slander but rather as a  physically contagious one.61 In explaining leprosy appearing on the  walls of a house, Nissim treats it as a form of mould that results from  rancid air and adversely affects the occupants of the dwelling. This  phenomenon he notes can still be found in Arab lands.62 Gersonides  offers a similar explanation in his commentary to Leviticus 13:47. In  general, many of the laws of impurity and of purification are seen as  related to combating physical contagion, impurity not being simply a  “fancied notion” referring to touching things held as unpleasant or  disgusting, as Maimonides describes it.63 Dead bodies actually physi- cally contaminate things with which they are in contact and many of  59 See Sefer ha-Batim, 130-131; Ma‘aseh Nissim, 347; Gersonides’ commentary to  Genesis 6-9, Lesson 10 (Perushei Ralbag ‘al HaTorah, volume 1, ed. Jacob Lev Levy  [Jerusalem: Mossad HaRav Kook 1992], 92-3). Gersonides shows also how the  contemplation of the allegoric significance of sacrifice stimulates the intellect and  prepares it for prophecy.  60 See Ma‘aseh Nissim, 399-400. 61 Ibid., 374-375. 62 Ibid., 378.

In the section titled “The Quality of Prophecy and  the Secrets of the Torah,” in the second part of his monumental ency- clopedia Livyat Ḥen,65 Levi devotes fourteen chapters to this subject  (chapters 13-26).66 He is of the opinion that this topic in fact belongs to  the secrets of the Torah. As is the case with other secrets, the time is  now ripe to reveal this one. In his view, in order to achieve the goals for  which the commandments were intended, one must observe them with  the proper intent, which requires knowing their reasons. Levi opens his discussion by presenting the Maimonidean idea of  the equibalance of the commandments, in which there is no deficiency  or excess, and which guide the individual in accordance with the just  middle path while avoiding the opposing extremes of laxity and overly  burdensome restrictions. Insofar as the Torah is perfect, and within  each species what is perfect is unique, the Torah will never undergo any  abrogation or change, and no divine law will ever replace it.67 Levi goes  so far as to liken the immutability and uniqueness of the Torah to that  of God. In the following chapter, the commandments are divided by him in  different ways, many of the divisions revolving around the Maimoni- dean notion that the purpose of the Torah is to promote the welfare of  64 See, for example, Sefer ha-Batim, 176. Allegoric reasons are also adduced for  understanding the laws of purity and purification. See in particular Gersonides’  discussion of these laws immediately following his commentary to Leviticus 11:46. 65 For a discussion of Levi and his encyclopedia see above, chapter 5. 66 Levi ben Avraham, Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy and the Secrets of the Torah,  ed. Howard Kreisel (Beer-Sheva: Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press,  2007), 304-622 (Heb.). 67 Ibid., 305; cf. Guide 2.39. While Maimonides’ discussion suggests that the perfect  specimen must be unique, since there cannot be two completely identical yet  distinct members of a species, this argument in reference to the Torah is made  explicit by Anatoli in Malmad ha-Talmidim, 191a-b. </page> <page sequence="23"> The Reasons for the Commandments  383 the body and the welfare of the soul.68 For example, one of the divi- sions is between mishpatim, which come to promote peace and justice in  the world, and the “commandments of the heart,” which come to  perfect the soul. Levi is of the opinion that the individual who lives in  isolation does not require the first category of commandments, nor do  the pure individuals who have no desire to harm others. He brings as  an example the inhabitants of India who, according to one of the tales  told about them, live together in perfect harmony without any legal  code, courts, or police—a tale whose apparent origin is one of the  versions of The Gests of Alexander of Macedon, which was very popular  in the Middle Ages.69 This natural trait, however, does not pertain to  the Israelites, hence their need for such laws. Another division, which  he attributes to Maimonides, involves three main categories: those  involving moral virtues, those involving beliefs, and those involving  actions. Among the actions, some come to preserve a true belief (e.g.,  the Sabbath) or to eliminate a false one (e.g., sacrifices), and some come  as symbolic actions pointing to moral lessons (e.g., the red heifer), or to  theoretical truths involving God and the world (e.g., the menorah in  the Sanctuary). Others come to leave a positive impress on the soul of  the individual (e.g., awe of the Sanctuary).70 Levi then devotes twelve chapters to different commandments or  groups of commandments. The topics alone indicate where his major  concerns lie. The order is as follows: 1) commandments whose purpose  is to inculcate noble moral traits (in which he deals with forbidden  foods and laws of purification as well as charitable gifts); 2) command- ments concerning incest, circumcision, and vows; 3) the sale of houses  in walled cities, the red heifer, and cities of refuge; 4) commandments  whose purpose is to eradicate idolatry; 5) commandments whose  68 Guide 3.27. 69 Levi ben Avraham, Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 324-342. Moses Ibn  Tibbon brings this tale in his Ma’amar ha-Taninim, which probably served as Levi’s  immediate source. See The Writings of R. Moshe Ibn Tibbon, 239. For a discussion  of this tale and the sources in which it appears, see ibid., note 54. It should be  noted that a version of the Gests was translated into Hebrew as early as the begin- ning of the thirteenth century. 70 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 354. </page> <page sequence="24"> 384 Chapter Ten purpose is to honor the Holy Sanctuary; 6) commandments whose  purpose is to strengthen the faith; 7) Sabbath and Festivals; 8) command- ments whose purpose is to hint at matters of wisdom or to stimulate us  to learn; 9) the Tabernacle and its Utensils 10) the altar 11) the structure  of the Sanctuary 12) the Vestments of the High Priest.71 Levi’s discus- sion of the commandments is designed more as a supplement to  Maimonides’ discussion than an alternative to it. While he does not  attempt to deal with the reasons for each of the commandments or to  organize them systematically, his encyclopedic tendency finds its  expression in the multiple reasons he presents for the various command- ments and their details with which he deals. Moreover, much of his  discussion is devoted to the citation and explication of rabbinic  midrashim pertaining to the commandments, in an attempt to under- stand them along philosophic-scientific lines. As in the case of  Maimonides, he distinguishes between homiletic explanations and  those that he feels uncover the true intent of the commandment.72 Naturalistic and allegorical reasons dominate Levi’s approach. As  is the case with many of his contemporaries in Provence, Levi views  astrology as a practical science, hence he sees astrologic reasons  underlying a number of the commandments, such as the Sabbath, the  breastplate of the High Priest, and even the reason for the date of the  High Holidays.73 On this point he too is far more influenced by  the approach of Ibn Ezra than that of Maimonides.74 While he does not  reject Maimonides’ historical-anthropological explanation of many of  the commandments, he supplements them with explanations that are  ahistorical. In this manner he underscores the trans-historical value of  each of the commandments. We have already seen that Maimonides treats the laws of purity  and impurity as based for the most part on a “fancied notion”75—an  71 In chapter 27, Levi deals with the significance of numbers—those that characterize  some of the commandments, as well as other matters found in the Torah. 72 See above, note 44. 73 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 522-523, 534-535, 556-557, 615-616; see also  below. 74 See above, note 51.  75 See above, note 63. </page> <page sequence="25"> The Reasons for the Commandments  385 idea based not on reality but on vain imaginings. Maimonides traces  many of these imaginings to the Sabians, and argues that the Torah  attempts to limit the severity of these laws by confining them primarily  to ritual matters and not to everyday life.76 In essence, he treats the  approach of the Torah to these matters as similar to that of sacrifices.  The Torah compromises with the existing situation by legislating laws  in harmony with the prevalent views and practices, at the same time  that it limits the scope of the practice of these laws. This is also true of  laws that do touch upon daily matters, such as the laws concerning  menstruating women, which were legislated because of the widely held  negative attitude toward menstruation, and in Maimonides’ view were  much less restrictive than the laws of the Sabians.77 Levi, on the other  hand, is more interested in downplaying this historical approach. The  laws of menstruation, for example, also limit the desire for sexual inter- course.78 In addition, menstrual blood is viewed by Levi as poisonous  coarse matter, and not simply as something that was deemed unclean in  popular imagination. Any newborn that is formed from it will have a  bad temperament and be infected, hence the reason for prohibiting  intercourse with menstruating women. Levi cites not only a midrash in  support of this view,79 but also medical scholars.80 Levi traces the impurity of dead bodies to their poisonous effect on  the surrounding air, which also explains the rabbinic injunction to  distance dead carcasses and cemeteries from the city, as well as the  biblical prohibition against leaving the body of an executed criminal  hanging overnight, in order not to defile your land (Deuteronomy 21:23).  The air of the Land of Israel in Levi’s view is much purer than that of  Egypt. For those growing up in Israel, any pollution to its air will result  in far greater injury to them than in the case of those who grew up  76 Guide 3.47. 77 Ibid. 78 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 379-381. 79 Tanḥuma (Buber), Metzora‘, 3. 80 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 388-389.

Human corpses produce much more contamina- tion than the dead of other species in his view, hence the more severe  restrictions regarding contact with them and the utensils in their  vicinity. Levi explains the reason why the same restrictions do not  apply to the corpses of Gentiles (or beasts) from two different (and  somewhat conflicting) sociological perspectives. On one hand, Jews  naturally shy away from the dead bodies of Gentiles as well as beasts,  hence there is no need to legislate in this matter; on the other hand, the  Gentile dead are buried all over the place, within the city as well as by  the side of thoroughfares, making such restrictions impossible to  uphold.82 Levi regards leprosy as a highly contagious disease, and not as a  supernatural punishment. This is the reason that no exceptions are  made in the law to isolate the leper from the community, no matter how  noble is the afflicted individual. The notion that leprosy comes to those  speaking evil of others is nothing more than a rabbinic homily in his  view. The reason for the initial seven days of isolation he traces to the  fact that this is the natural length of time for the course of many  diseases. The fact that leprosy may be found in the walls of houses is  explained by the possibility that the air may transfer the characteristics  of this pestilence to them.83 Allegorical reasons are more readily employed to explain the  process of purification. Levi adduces explanations of this sort for the  purification ceremony of the leper.84 Similarly, allegorical explanations  are offered for all the details of the law of the red heifer.85 81 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 393-394. 82 Ibid., 401-403, 494. 83 Ibid., 400-401 84 Ibid., 497-499. 85 Ibid., 500-502. </page> <page sequence="27"> The Reasons for the Commandments  387 Many of the explanations for the commandments already encoun- tered among other Provençal thinkers are contained in Levi’s treatise,86  from the allegorical understanding of the structure of the Temple and  its vessels to the practical effects of aspects of the Temple service in  bringing about a purification of the brain, and even prophecy. A natu- ralistic approach is also presented for the prohibitions concerning  agriculture and forbidden foods. Influences of Levi’s Christian milieu at times can also be detected  in his discussion of the commandments.87 In discussing circumcision,  for example, Levi offers the reasons brought by Maimonides: to dampen  the sexual drive, and to serve as sign of unity. As opposed to some of  the other Provençal philosophers, he does not talk of the diseases asso- ciated with the foreskin, perhaps because he, like Maimonides, sensed  that such an explanation suggests a defect in God’s creation.88 There  remains, nonetheless, a subtle but significant difference between their  approaches. Maimonides writes in an Islamic environment in which  Moslems also practice circumcision. Thus for Maimonides circumcision  is a sign uniting all those who believe in the unity of God, and he  formulates his position accordingly.89 Levi, writing in a Christian envi- ronment, sees circumcision as a sign uniting Jews and preserving them  in their far-flung Diaspora while other nations disappeared, a theme  that will reemerge in Spinoza’s thought.90 Levi’s Christian milieu also has an impact on another significant  point in his discussion. He attempts to show the superiority of circum- cision over baptism in that the former is a permanent signed impressed  upon the flesh. The Christians, however, argue the shortcoming of  86 In some cases, Levi’s treatise may well have been their source. Nissim was  definitely acquainted with Levi’s treatise, though he never mentions the author by  name. It appears that the same is true of HaKokhavi. 87 Levi devotes chapter 12 to a polemic against Christianity, showing his awareness of  Christian views.

This will lead also to the perfec- tion of the woman, for her enjoyment of sex will lessen because of  this, as they say: “One having sex with an uncircumcised male finds  it difficult to refrain” (Genesis Rabbah 80.11). In addition, the  woman is part of the creation of man, a rib of his ribs. She is under  his service and dominion, Follows him and is included in his  commandments. In man’s removal of what is superfluous, the woman  removes it too. Moreover, the woman’s observance and care taken  during the days of her menstruation, her cleansing and purification,  take the place of this intent. It is known that the heart is the fore- most minister for the power of giving birth. For this reason, diminishing  the moisture of the man from the outset purifies his blood, cools  down and diminishes his [evil] inclination, calms his nature, refines  the power of his intellect, and [leads him to] attain a good tempera- ment. The offspring will then be born with this characteristic, and  this nature will be strengthened in his sons and daughters. This  commandment thus includes men and women.92 Levi’s acquaintance with Christian practices, which he observes from  his neighbors, finds its expression in other discussions of the reasons  for the commandments. He even sees the Christians as having intro- duced new holidays in imitation of Jewish ones. For example, in his  discussion of the ten days of repentance between the New Year and the  Day of Atonement, Levi sees an astrological basis for the idea found in  rabbinic literature that this is a period of divine judgment, inasmuch as  this is the period of the Fall equinox in which the sun enters into the  constellation of Libra, represented by scales of judgment (hence in  Hebrew the constellation is termed moznayim, meaning scales). In  Levi’s view, the Christians, seeing that the Jews observed a holiday  in this period revolving around God’s judgment of the world, decided  91 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 417. 92 Ibid., 416. </page> <page sequence="29"> The Reasons for the Commandments  389 to adopt this practice: “And in imitation of us, the gentiles made a  holiday in this period for Michael, and they said that he examines souls  and weighs their actions.”93 Levi refers here to Michaelmas, named  after the archangel Michael, which in the West is celebrated on  September 29. Michael is normally depicted as holding scales, and  according to Christian belief will blow the great horn on the Day of  Judgment and will accompany the souls to the presence of God. I would like to conclude this section with a lengthy example of  Levi’s allegoric understanding of the reasons for one matter pertaining  to a number of commandments, which will help to convey a deeper  appreciation of his approach. The example is taken from chapter 18,  dealing with the commandments whose purpose is to eradicate idolatry.  After a lengthy exposition of the reason for sacrifices that basically  follows the lines of Maimonides’ approach, Levi turns to the reason  for the prohibition of offering leaven and honey in a burnt offering  (Leviticus 2:11). He first ties the reason for this prohibition with  ancient idolatrous practices, as does Maimonides in Guide 3.46, and  then continues: We have already hinted at another reason in the first part of Batei  ha-Nefesh ve-ha-Leḥashim,94 namely that the leaven is sour, cold, and  dry, the opposite of honey. Matzah (unleavened bread) too is dry by  nature and signifies a lack of appetite for physical pleasures. Leaven  alludes to an evil appetite and the strengthening of matter, as it is  said: “Who detains us [from performing God’s will]? The leaven in  the dough and the subjugation by the nations” [BT Berakhot 17a]. It  is also said: Knead the dough until it is leavened [Hosea 7:4], that is,  until they put into action their evil intentions.95 In the case of the first proof text, one may understand by the context  that the leaven refers to the evil inclination. The latter proof text, on  the other hand, can only be understood by a thorough knowledge of  Levi’s source. This is characteristic of his entire composition and cannot  simply be explained by the copyist shortening the quotes found in  93 Ibid., 541. 94 For a description of this poem see above, chapter 5, 120-121. 95 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 453-454. </page> <page sequence="30"> 390 Chapter Ten the original version of the treatise, as is often the case. Levi assumes  that his readers know the Bible and rabbinic literature by heart and  that they can complete the text to which he alludes and thereby under- stand the point he is making. The beginning of the verse in Hosea 7:4,  which he does not explicitly quote, reads as follows: They are all adul- terers, like an oven heated by the baker. He rests from stoking the fire from  the time of the kneading of the dough until it is leavened. With the knowl- edge of the complete verse, the reference is clear. Levi next takes up the problem of why leaven is required in the  offering of the first fruits, goes on to deal with the reason why leaven is  forbidden on Passover, and enters into a brief legal discussion on how  the command: Eliminate the leaven (tashbitu se’or) (Exodus 12:15) is to  be fulfilled, whether by burning or by annulment. He shows that the  leaven that one knows about is burnt, while that which remains  unknown to the person is annulled. He then adduces the symbolic  meaning of both these activities. He concludes this part of his discus- sion with the following comment: We find that the prohibition of leaven on Passover alludes to  two good intentions: remembering the miracle and removing the  superfluous physical desires. The honey hints at overspeculation  (hitḥakhmut), studying those matters that do not enter the province  of the hylic intellect96 and looking for demonstrative proof where  none is to be found.97 Levi goes on to cite a number of verses, most prominently Proverbs  25:16: Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, lest you  be sated and vomit it out. This verse appears in the story in Tractate  Ḥagigah of the four who entered pardes and is also analyzed by Maimon- ides in Guide 1.32. In short, the intake of honey—that is to say, engaging  in speculation—by one who does not have the proper constitution for  it may lead to heresy, while the right amount of honey that is suitable  for one’s digestion is good. 96 In other words, studying matters the human intellect is incapable of understanding.  The hylic intellect refers to the human potential for grasping the intelligibles. 97 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 455; cf. Guide 1.32. </page> <page sequence="31"> The Reasons for the Commandments  391 Levi continues this line of thought by remarking: “It is the obliga- tion of the individual to investigate the reasons for the Torah and its  secrets. For this reason the Torah commanded not to eliminate salt  from the sacrifice. It is said:98 ‘Can one give it taste as understanding?99  Scripture says: You should salt it [Leviticus 2:13]’ [BT Menaḥot 21a].”100  While the exact meaning of this text has been subject to conflicting  interpretations,101 Levi cites it to show that one should pursue the  secrets contained in the Torah by means of one’s understanding, which  is symbolized by the salt that is applied to the sacrifice. Salt, Levi also  points out, is a symbol for the covenant. What follows is a discourse on  the need to pursue wisdom. In this manner, the discussion continues moving between details  of the commandments and the moral and theoretical lessons they are  designed to stimulate in those who ponder them. Numerous discussions  regarding different commandments follow this pattern in Levi’s trea- tise. The reader of Livyat Ḥen may be tempted to conclude that what  we are dealing with here is simply homilies on homilies, that is to say,  Levi’s homilies on rabbinic homilies. This misses the point. Levi feels  that his expositions capture an important dimension of the biblical  texts themselves, texts that the Sages only partially illuminated by  their expositions, and which Levi is further illuminating by his. All  these expositions are part of the original intent of the text. I would say  that his approach has an element that anticipates the approach of  Samson Raphael Hirsch in modern times.102 Yet it should be noted that  98 The discussion there deals with the salt that is to be applied to the sacrifice, in the  course of which the Sages define tevunehu, a term appearing in a baraitha that is  used in reference to the manner salt should not be applied 99 In Hebrew: הניבכ םעט וב ןתי לוכי. 100 Livyat Ḥen: The Quality of Prophecy, 455. 101 Rashi explains the question: Can you give it taste just as understanding gives a  person distinction? This apparently means to immerse it in salt. According to the  Arukh by Nathan ben Yeḥiel: Can you give it a taste of discernment (reading  tevunah rather than ke-binah)—that is, just enough so that the taste of salt can be  discerned? Both these sources were known to Levi. 102 See in particular Hirsch’s discussion of symbolism in his essay Grundlinien einer  juedischen Symbolik published in Gesammelte Schriften, ed. Naphtali Hirsch (Frank- furt, 1908-1912), vol. 3, 211-447 (partially translated into English in Timeless Torah,  ed. Jacob Breuer [New York: Feldheim, 1957], 303-420). </page> <page sequence="32"> 392 Chapter Ten Levi is totally familiar with the standard scientific Hebrew lexico- graphic works of his period, Yonah Ibn Ghanaḥ’s Book of Roots, David  Kimḥi’s treatise by the same name, and Nathan ben Yeḥiel’s Arukh.  He thereby bases his etymological discussions on what would be consid- ered in the Middle Ages a solid linguistic footing. Perhaps more  interesting, there are elements in Levi’s approach that are reminiscent  of some of the kabbalistic approaches to the commandments, at least in  form if not in content. This topic deserves further investigation. While Levi may have gone down in history as a heretical thinker  whose treatise was banned by the Rashba, from his discussion we can  discern that he was looking for ways to maintain and enhance the value  of the commandments. Many of the commandments were converted  into symbolic acts, though not theurgic ones,103 the appreciation of  which required both philosophic study and the study of the entire  rabbinic tradition. Whatever one may think of this endeavor, one that  weds the prophets and the rabbinic sages to Aristotelian philosophers  and occult scientists, at least one thing clearly emerges from the reading  of this passage from Levi’s treatise. Only one with a profound knowl- edge and commitment to Jewish law and lore could have written it.104 Conclusion Let us return to Maimonides. I began this chapter by asking why he  includes a discussion of the reasons of the commandments as part of the  Guide, when the purpose of his treatise as he presents it is to offer an  explanation of the secrets of the Torah that are presented in Scripture  103 Some of his naturalistic explanations, on the other hand, would strike today’s  reader as being essentially magical, since they are predicated on astrological beliefs.  On the distinction between natural and magical, see Howard Kreisel, Prophecy:  The History of an Idea in Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic  Publishers, 2001), 618-622. 104 One reading the polemical literature against the philosophic camp in the controver- sies of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries may come away with the impression  that the more radical members of this camp were not well versed in rabbinic tradi- tion. In the case of Levi at least, as well as Nissim, who could be considered even a  more radical rationalist, this was definitely not the case. The immersion of these  thinkers in rabbinic tradition, and not just those who were known as “moderate”  Maimonideans, such as Menaḥem HaMeiri, deserves a separate study. </page> <page sequence="33"> The Reasons for the Commandments  393 in parable form. The reasons for the commandments are not listed by  him among the secrets of the Torah, and he explicitly indicates that the  commandments are not to be treated as parables. Herbert Davidson  has adduced textual evidence in support of his conclusion that Maimon- ides did not have most of the Guide written when he wrote the  introduction.105 If Davidson is correct, the Guide may in fact have  really been a work in progress, with its final shape taking place in the  course of the writing. It follows from this view that Maimonides’  lengthy discussion of the commandments may not have been part of his  original plan for the treatise. Rather it was the result of a decision in  the midst of the work to write a broader theological work and to include  additional topics that are crucial for an understanding of the rela- tion between Judaism and Aristotelian philosophy. He felt the need  to complete the picture, as it were. What is the overall purpose of  the Torah and the reason for its specific commandments, particularly  those that appear to have no discernible reason, is certainly a cause for  perplexity for one grounded in both traditions, one that calls for an  explanation. One can only hypothesize why Maimonides was boldly willing to  offer a historical relativistic view for so many of the commandments in  the course of discussing this topic. It should be noted that most, though  certainly not all, of the commandments to which his historical explana- tion applies were not being practiced in Maimonides’ time, most  notably all the commandments involving the Sanctuary. His explana- tion suggests that Jews are not worse off for it, though they are certainly  worse off in his view for not living in a sovereign Jewish state ruled by  Jewish Law.106 Moreover, his approach to the commandments suggests  105 See Herbert Davidson, Moses Maimonides: The Man and His Works (Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 2005), 327-334. In Davidson’s view, this point helps  explain the absence of instances of discernable contradictions in the Guide, and the  overall absence of any esoteric teachings. As Maimonides continued to write the  Guide, he changed his mind about introducing contradictions as a writing tech- nique or introducing esoteric teachings. I do not think that Davidson is right  concerning the issue of Maimonides’ esotericisim, but further evidence can be  adduced for his basic position that the introduction was written prior to the actual  writing of much of the treatise. 106 See, for example, his remarks on living in exile in Guide 2.36. </page> <page sequence="34"> 394 Chapter Ten a historic dynamism in which progress could be made in creating a more  perfect religion within the framework of Mosaic Law.107 His repeated  insistence that the law is immutable108 comes to address Maimonides’  contemporary concerns. It does not negate the view that he regards  these commandments as far from ideal in his own time, let alone in the  messianic future.109 This is not to question his belief in the view that in  the time of the messiah all the commandments will again be practiced.110  It is to argue that Maimonides’ focus is on the present. He develops a  view of the messianic future that best supports what he is trying to  accomplish in the here and now amidst the multiple challenges that  confront Judaism from within and without.111 In regard to the command- ments whose rationale is a historical relativistic one and that continued  to be practiced in Maimonides’ time, religious existential reasons could  be substituted for historical ones, as he at times does in the Mishneh  Torah, in order to maintain their relevance. It is not without much irony that one of the main charges against  the medieval Provençal Jewish philosophers in the controversies that  erupted in the first half of the thirteenth century and then at the begin- ning of the fourteenth century is that they allegorize the Torah and its  commandments. In other words they follow the same route taken by  the Christians.112 Yet it was not for the purpose of throwing off the yoke  107 One should note also Maimonides’ attempts to limit the scope of the Oral Law,  which from a legal perspective broadened the scope of laws that could be changed  with the reconvening of the Sanhedrin in the messianic period. See Kreisel,  Maimonides’ Political Thought, 21-22. 108 See particularly the ninth principle of faith in his Commentary on the Mishnah:  Introduction to Pereq Ḥeleq. 109 Maimonides alludes to this point when he subtly suggests that were a prophet to  come in his own period, he would not command sacrifices; see Guide 3.32. 110 See Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and their Wars 11.1. 111 See above, chapter 2, 38-39. 112 This point emerges clearly from the letters accompanying R. Solomon Ibn Adret’s  ban against the allegorical preachers, signaling out Levi; see Abba Mari of Lunel,  Sefer Minḥat Qena’ot, ed. Haim Z. Dimitrovsky (Jerusalem: Mossad Harav Kook,  1990), 726-737.
