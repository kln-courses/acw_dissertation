<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is Deviance "Dead"? The Decline of a Sociological Research Specialization J. Mitchell Miller, Richard A. Wright, and David Dannels Colin Sumner has declared that the sociology of deviance as a research specialty was "dead" by 1975; later influential studies on norm-violating behavior appeared only in the specific area of criminology. We subjected this argument to empirical test through an analysis of the most-cited scholars and works in 263 textbooks, articles, and research notes appearing in the sociology of deviance from 1993 to 1999- We found some support for Sumner's claims: The majority of the most-cited scholars in devi ance today conduct research in other areas, primarily in criminology. Furthermore, among the 31 most-cited works in our analysis, only two of 15 studies classified in the sociology of deviance appeared after 1975. We conclude with some thoughts about the factors that contribute to the rise and fall of research specializations in sociology. In a provocative historical review, Sumner (1994) proclaimed the death of the sociology of deviance. Subtitling his study "an obituary," he argued that the sociology of deviance ceased to exist in 1975, the victim of attacks from radical theorists on the left, along with a shift toward the analysis of more specific crime and justice topics among mainstream scholars. Sumner asserted that no influential contributions in the sociology of deviance appeared after 1975, al though he offered no quantitative empirical evidence to support this claim. We assessed Sumner's arguments by analyzing the most frequently cited scholars and works in the sociology of deviance. Through an examination of recent textbooks, articles, and research notes published in leading journals, we found that over one-half of the most-cited scholars were not primarily known for studies in the sociology of deviance, but for research in other areas, prima rily criminology. Furthermore, among the most-cited works, only two published after 1975 were classified in the area of the sociology of deviance. These findings seem to show the declining influence of scholarship in the sociology of deviance. We conclude this article with some speculation about the factors that contrib ute to the rise and fall of research specializations within sociology.

Miller, Wright, and Dannels 43</page><page sequence="2">son of the sociology of deviance with early developments in criminology sug gests that a core of general theories must emerge for a research specialization to prosper. Simmer's "Obituary" for the Sociology of Deviance In 1994, Sumner offered his controversial anthropomorphic history of the sociology of deviance; he heralded the area's "birth" in the work of Emile Durkheim (specifically, with the publication of The Rules of Sociological Method in 1895). The sociology of deviance blossomed in the 1950s and the early 1960s with the emergence of the labeling perspective (see Becker [19631 1973; Goffman 1963; Lemert 1951), only to be decimated in the late 1960s and early 1970s by radical theorists who criticized the area for ignoring the roles of the "power elite" and "master institutions" in the assignment of labels (Gouldner 1968; also, see Liazos 1972; Thio 1973). Sumner argued that the sociology of deviance was "dead" by 1975, as first mainstream researchers and then critical thinkers turned their attention away from the general analysis of deviance toward the more specific study of crime and justice issues (cf., Taylor, Walton, and Young 1973, 1975). What "killed" the sociology of deviance? Sumner (1994) argued that the relativism of the area (the view that deviance was created situationally), along with the ambitious attempt to explain a broad array of legal and illegal behav iors (ranging from crime and delinquency to substance abuse, suicide, sexual deviance, mental illness, political protest, and religious extremism), meant that the sociology of deviance could not generate a core group of general theories. In Sumner's (1994: 309) words, if deviance was nothing more than "a passing feature of specific situations, contexts, and cultures varying in behavioral con tent from one another, then it was clearly not a behavioral phenomenon." Reactions to Sumner's (1994) "obituary" for the sociology of deviance have ranged from total silence in the leading journal in the area (no article, research note, or book review appearing in Deviant Behavior has even mentioned Sumner's work), to name-calling by a prominent textbook author (Goode? 1997: ix?dismisses Sumner's work as "inane and flatulent"), to some agree ment (Bader, Becker, and Desmond 1996). In a note on pedagogy, Bader, Becker, and Desmond (1996) discuss the difficulties in separating the subject matter in deviance from criminology in those sociology departments that offer both courses. The authors' brief review of a handful of sociology of deviance and criminology textbooks and the journal Deviant Behavior showed that most of what appeared in these publications addressed crime and justice issues, not broader concerns relating to legal and illegal norm-violations. Given the importance of Sumner's (1994) arguments, we undertook a study of numerous publications, employing a technique specifically devised to mea sure the influence of scholars and works: citation analysis. If Sumner's claims have some merit, then a split should be observed in research on norm violating behavior. Citations to influential scholars and works in the general area of the sociology of deviance should disappear after 1975, replaced by citations to prominent scholars and works specifically dealing with crime and justice issues. 44 The American Sociologist / Fall 2001</page><page sequence="3">Research Design Academicians have traditionally judged the influence of scholars and publica tions by the number of citations they receive in leading periodicals (see Bott and Hargens 1991; Cohn, Farrington, and Wright 1998; Cole and Cole 1973; Roche and Smith 1978; Wolfgang, Figlio, and Thornberry 1978). In an extensive critical review, Cohn, Farrington, and Wright (1998: 4) concluded that, when compared to rival techniques (e.g., peer review of scholars, counts of journal publications, and receipt of scholarly awards and prizes), citation analysis is the most valid and reliable, "straightforward, objective, [and] quantitative measure of [the] influence and prestige" of scholars and works. Throughout academia, citations in leading periodicals are customarily used to evaluate faculty for promotion and tenure and to rank the prestige of academic departments and programs (Cohn, Farrington, and Wright 1998). For example, recent studies in sociology have evaluated the influence of individual scholars (Cohn and Farrington 1996, 1998b; Wright 1998), disciplinary specializations (Wright and Friedrichs 1998; Wright and Miller 1998; Wright and Sheridan 1997), research articles, chapters, and books (Bott and Hargens 199D, textbooks (Wright 1995b; Wright and Carroll 1994), doctoral dissertations (Wright and Soma 1995), and depart ments and programs (Cohn and Farrington 1998a) through citation analyses of prominent journals. Consequently, we assumed that citation analysis offered a reasonable way to examine the argument that no influential works in the sociol ogy of deviance have appeared after 1975. We began our analysis by listing the most-cited scholars and works in the sociology of deviance. To compile these lists, we analyzed representative pub lications?textbooks, articles, and research notes?in the area from 1993 to 1999. All known textbooks (seven) appearing in the sociology of deviance during these years were examined, including Clinard and Meier (1998), Curra (1994), Goode (1997), McCaghy and Capron (1997), Pfohl (1994), Thio (1998), and Ward, Carter, and Perrin (1994).1 Articles and research notes were analyzed from five academic journals? American fournal of Sociology, American Sociological Review, Deviant Behav ior, Social Forces, and Social Problems. American fournal of Sociology, Ameri can Sociological Review, and Social Forces were chosen because they are customarily ranked as the leading general-interest journals published in sociol ogy (Allen 1990; Bott and Hargens 1991; Glenn 1971). We analyzed Social Problems because it is a respected journal that frequently publishes articles dealing with the sociology of deviance. Deviant Behavior was chosen for our study because it is the only periodical devoted solely to the general study of deviance.2 In the American fournal of Sociology, American Sociological Re view, Social Forces, and Social Problems, we examined only those articles and research notes that specifically dealt with the topic of deviance; all articles/ research notes appearing in Deviant Behavior were studied.3 Altogether, 256 articles and research notes were analyzed.4 Specialized journals and research monographs and books devoted to particu lar forms of deviant behavior were excluded from our analysis because we wished to identify the most-cited scholars and works in the general area of the sociology of deviance. Analyzing the citation patterns in specialized publica Miller, Wright, and Dannels 45</page><page sequence="4">tions would have required the difficult task of compiling a comprehensive bibliography of all the journals (e.g., Contemporary Drug Problems, Criminol ogy, fournal of Drug Issues, fournal of Homosexuality, fournal of Interpersonal Violence, fournal of Studies on Alcohol, and Suicide and Life-Threatening Behav ior) and books dealing with every form of deviant behavior. Fears that these logistical complications might bias our findings convinced us not to examine these publications. Most studies of journals tally citations from the references at the ends of articles/research notes. Wright and his associates, however, arguably have in troduced a more accurate, but cumbersome and time-consuming, means to count citations: Each mention of a scholar/work?in the text or in a substantive footnote?accompanied by a reference is counted as a citation (see Wright and Friedrichs 1998; Wright and Miller 1998; Wright and Sheridan 1997). Because we wanted to measure the influence of scholars and works using the most valid techniques, we followed the latter procedure. In most prior citation studies, self-citations have been a problem for re searchers. Some analysts have excluded these citations from their counts (Cohn and Farrington 1996, 1998b); others routinely include self-citations (Wright 1995a). Neither approach is entirely satisfactory: Excluding self-citations risks underes timating the influence of prolific scholars responsible for numerous publications examined in a study (in effect, these scholars are ranked based on fewer publications). Including self-citations risks overestimating the influence of scholars who are fond of citing their own work. A formula was recently introduced to adjust for self-citations (see Wright and Friedrichs 1998; Wright and Miller 1998; Wright and Sheridan 1998). "C2" (the adjusted number of citations) is calculated as follows: c, c 2 = c l + ? (P2), where "Cj" is the total number of citations to a scholar in publications not written by the scholar, "Pj" is the total number of publications not written by a scholar that cite his/her work, and "P2" is the total number of publications written by a scholar that contain self-citations. For all the publications that cite a scholar, this formula adjusts for self-citations by projecting the average number of citations the scholar receives in works that he/she did not write into the works that he/she wrote.5 We used this formula to calculate adjusted citation scores for each extensively cited scholar who wrote at least one article/re search note examined in our study that contained a self-citation, although the adjusted scores were used to rank scholars and works only when these esti mates were lower than the actual counts that included self-citations.6 Cohn and Farrington (1996) have advocated the use of incidence and preva lence measures to rank the most-cited scholars and works. Incidence is the total number of times that scholars/works were cited in the 263 publications that we examined; prevalence is the total number of publications that cite a scholar/ work. Citation studies that ignore prevalence measures risk overestimating the influence of scholars who are cited heavily, but only in a handful of publications. 46 The American Sociologist / Fall 2001</page><page sequence="5">Both incidence and prevalence measures were used to compile our lists of the most-cited scholars and works in the sociology of deviance. We identified the 50 most-cited scholars in incidence and in prevalence; combining these measures resulted in a list of 67 influential scholars (see Table 1). In our identification of the most-cited works, we implemented a simple procedure to offset the influence of "citation outliers" (i.e., works that were cited repeatedly in a few publications, but nowhere else). To appear on our most-cited lists, works had to be cited at least 20 times (incidence) in at least ten publications (prevalence). Thirty-one works met this criterion (see Table 3). After completing our citation analysis, we categorized scholars and works by research area. Through a content analysis of articles and research notes appear ing in Deviant Behavior, the seven textbooks that we examined, and works both endorsing the sociology of deviance (e.g., Becker 1963; Matza 1969) and criti cal of the area (Liazos 1972; Sumner 1994), we arrived at a conventional defini tion of the sociology of deviance, involving a distinctive subject matter, per spective, and method. First, the sociology of deviance attempts to explain both legal and illegal norm-violating behavior. Second, the sociology of deviance endorses a constructionist (relativistic and subjectivist) perspective that recog nizes that norms are created situationally and have social consequences. Third, the sociology of deviance favors ethnographic techniques, analyzing small samples of human subjects first-hand and in-depth. We conducted an extensive search and analysis of the publications written by the 67 most-cited scholars to see if they met this conventional definition. The 31 most-cited works in our study were also carefully reviewed. We classified scholars as "sociologists of deviance" and works as "sociologies of deviance" if the publications that we examined met any one of the defined criteria.7 We also examined publications to classify scholars and works into other research areas. Here, we defined criminology (including crime and justice re search) narrowly as the explanation of only illegal norm violations, from an objectivist perspective (that views the situational creation and social conse quences of norms as nonproblematic), using mostly quantitative measures (e.g., police statistics and survey research). Studies that appeared outside the areas of the sociology of deviance and criminology (e.g., in race and ethnic relations or sociological theory) were classified only by subject matter. On the rare occa sions where we had some difficulty classifying scholars by research area, we consulted the American Sociological Association's Guide to Graduate Programs (1989) and Biographical Directory of Members (1990) to make placements. Scholars and works were classified by research area, although works were further classified by year of publication. To determine if they appeared by 1975, we simply noted the original publication dates for the 31 most-cited works in our study. It is crucial to note that in all of our classifications, we chose to err in favor of false positives?over-identifying scholars and works with the sociology of devi ance?to subject Sumner's (1994) arguments to the sternest possible test.8 As suming the merit of Sumner's (1994) claims, we expected to find that many of the most-cited scholars identified by our research would be classified as crimi nologists, not as sociologists of deviance. Furthermore, we anticipated that virtually all of the most-cited works classified in the sociology of deviance Miller, Wright, and Dannels 47</page><page sequence="6">would be published by 1975; later works would be classified outside the area, mostly as criminological studies. Finally, we compared our findings on the most-cited scholars and works in the sociology of deviance to similar studies in criminology and criminal justice (specifically, to Cohn and Farrington 1996, and to Cohn, Farrington, and Wright 1998). The most-cited scholars and works in criminology/criminal justice were classified by research area (scholars and works) and years of publication (works) to determine if there were differences in the patterns of influence between the sociology of deviance and criminology. Findings Table 1 lists the 67 most-cited scholars in the sociology of deviance from the 263 publications that we examined, ranking these scholars by incidence and by prevalence of citations. Table 2 identifies these scholars by areas of research. Thirty-three of the 67 most-cited scholars (49-3%) were classified as sociolo gists of deviance; over one-half (34) are known for research in other areas. Most of the latter were categorized as criminologists, but some other specializa tions associated with scholars in the table included race and ethnic relations (Douglas S. Massey and William Julius Wilson) and sociological theory (Peter M. Blau and Robert K. Merton). In general, these data offer some support for Sumner's (1994) claim that in recent years, many influential scholars have turned their attention away from the broader topic of deviance, toward narrower re search concerns. This interpretation is reinforced when considering the 15 scholars?Ronald L. Akers, Howard S. Becker, Robert J. Bursik, Jr., Emile Durkheim, Delbert S. Elliott, Richard J. Gelles, Erving Goffman, Michael R. Gottfredson, Travis Hirschi, David Matza, Robert J. Sampson, Murray A. Straus, Edwin H. Sutherland, and William Julius Wilson?who placed among the ten most-cited authors in either incidence or prevalence measures. Only five of these scholars (Akers, Becker, Durkheim, Goffman, and Matza) were classified as sociologists of deviance; two of these are deceased (Durkheim and Goffman), while two others (Becker and Matza) have not published in the area of deviance since the early 1970s (see Becker [1963] 1973; Matza 1969). Among the eight scholars classified outside the sociology of deviance, only one is deceased and has no publica tions since 1975 (Sutherland). A comparison of the 67 most-cited scholars in our study with Cohn, Farrington, and Wright's (1998) list of the 49 most-cited scholars in nine leading criminol ogy/criminal justice journals published from 1991 to 1995 shows marked differ ences in the citation patterns between the sociology of deviance and criminol ogy/criminal justice. Forty-three of the 49 most-cited scholars (87.8%) in criminology/criminal justice journals were classified as criminologists; only six (12.2%) were classified outside criminology (all as sociologists of deviance, including Akers, John Braithwaite, Francis T. Cullen, Lloyd E. Ohlin, Raymond Paternoster, and Jock Young). Only one-half of the most-cited scholars in sociol ogy of deviance publications were classified as sociologists of deviance; almost nine-tenths of the most-cited scholars in recent criminology/criminal justice articles/research notes were classified as criminologists.

Again, these data seem to confirm a general decline in research interest in the sociology of deviance, at least when compared to criminology/ criminal justice. Table 3, shown on pages 52-53, reports the most-cited works in the 263 publications that we examined. Again, to compile this list, we required works to be cited a minimum of 20 times (incidence) in at least ten publications (prevalence). Altogether, 31 works met this criterion. Table 3 ranks these works by incidence and by prevalence. Table 4, shown on page 54, categorizes the 31 most-cited works from Table 3 by research area. Fifteen of the most cited works (48.4%) were classified as sociologies of deviance; the remaining 16 works (51.6%) were classified in other research areas, primarily in criminology. This suggests that most of the influential works in the sociology of deviance in recent years were published outside the conventional area of deviance research. Table 4 also reports data on the publication dates of works. Thirteen (86.7%) of the works classified in the area of the sociology of deviance were published by 1975; only Braithwaite (1989) and Katz (1988) appeared after 1975.

This seems to show a decline in sociol ogy of deviance research after 1975, the year Sumner (1994) claimed that deviance research "died." A comparison of the 31 most-cited works in our study with Cohn and Farrington's (1996) list of the 54 most-cited works in the criminology and crimi nal justice source journals indexed in the Social Science Citation Index from 1986 to 1993 again shows notable differences in the citation patterns between the sociology of deviance and criminology/criminal justice.9 Forty-one of the 54 most-cited works (75.9%) in criminology/criminal justice were classified as criminological; only 13 works (24.1%) were classified outside the area of crimi nology, all as sociologies of deviance.10 Ten of the works (71.4%) classified in the area of the sociology of deviance were published by 1975; only Cohen (1985), Foucault (1977), and Rothman (1980) appeared after 1975. By compari son, 21 (51.2%) of the works classified as criminological studies were published after 1975. Finally, we pooled the data from Table 4 with Cohn and Farrington's (1996) list of the most-cited works in criminology/criminal justice, deleting overlap ping works.11 Here, we found that five of the 23 works (21.7%) classified in the area of the sociology of deviance appeared after 1975, compared to 25 of the 54 The American Sociologist / Fall 2001</page><page sequence="13">47 works (53.2%) published in other areas. These differences were statistically significant (chi square = 6.34; df = 1; p &lt; .05). This shows that in the combined sociology of deviance and criminology/criminal justice literatures, few influen tial works identified with the area of deviance appeared after 1975, once more supporting Sumner's (1994) arguments. Summary and Implications Sumner's (1994) controversial review of the sociology of deviance asserted that the area "died" in 1975. He claimed that all of the important developments in the specialization had occurred by 1975; later influential research on norm violating behavior appeared only in the more specific area of criminology. We subjected these arguments to empirical test through an analysis of the most cited scholars and works in 263 recent publications appearing in the sociology of deviance. This study found some support for Sumner's claims: The majority of the most-cited scholars in sociology of deviance today actually conduct stud ies in other areas, mostly in criminology. Furthermore, among the 31 most-cited works in our analysis, 13 of 19 published by 1975?but only two of 12 pub lished later?were classified as studies in the sociology of deviance. Sumner (1994) attributes the "death" of the sociology of deviance to the inability of scholars in the area to generate a core group of general theories that could explain both legal and illegal norm-violating behavior. It is interesting to note that a similar criticism and predicament once confronted sociological crimi nology. In the early 1930s, the Bureau of Social Hygiene in New York City commissioned a study to evaluate the desirability of establishing a national institute to train criminological researchers. Referred to as the "Michael-Adler Report" ([1933] 1971), authors Jerome Michael and Mortimer J. Adler excoriated existing criminological research for its failure to create abstract, general theories that could explain all forms of criminal behavior. Some of the most prominent criminologists of the day?including Thorsten J. Sellin and Edwin H. Sutherland?were deeply stung by these criticisms, but privately acknowledged that they had some merit (Cohen, Lindesmith, and Schuessler 1956; Gaylord and Galliher 1988). What followed was a veritable explosion in the development of general sociological explanations of criminal behavior, with the appearance of anomie theory (Merton 1938), culture conflict theory (Sellin 1938), differential association theory (Sutherland 1939), and so cial disorganization theory (Shaw and McKay 1942). Regardless of whether these perspectives owed some debt to the Michael-Adler Report or emerged despite it, they inspired researchers for decades, building the foundation for modern sociological criminology. Once a new sociological research specialization develops, it appears that it must soon generate a cluster of general theories to guide empirical research, or face the prospect of decline. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, such luminaries as Robert K. Merton, Thorsten J. Sellin, Clifford R. Shaw, Henry D. McKay, and Edwin H. Sutherland were able to advance sociological criminology through their prodigious theoretical efforts. After savage attacks devastated the labeling perspective some 30 years later (Gouldner 1968; Liazos 1972; Thio 1973), however, sociologists of deviance failed to offer alternative theories. This re Miller, Wright, and Dannels 55</page><page sequence="14">suited in the decline of the specialty, as documented by our study. Undoubt edly, similar dynamics have affected the fortunes of other research specializa tions in sociology. Despite the findings of our analysis, we believe that it is an exaggeration to say that the sociology of deviance is "dead." Clearly, the textbooks and courses devoted to the area stubbornly rebut Sumner's "obituary." Furthermore, the social constructionist view so integral to the deviance perspective continues to stimulate thinking in various ways, through its diffusion into the analysis of multiple social problems (Spector and Kitsuse 1987), its revival in criminologi cal theory (Braithwaite 1989; Paternoster and Iovanni 1989), and its integration into critical feminism and postmodernism (Pfohl 1994). The rapid rise of crimi nal justice as a practitioner-oriented discipline has probably also taken some toll on research and theory in the sociology of deviance by: (1) making it easier to market objectivist, quantitative studies to funding agencies and to leading jour nals, (2) depleting the number of scholars willing to specialize in deviance, and (3) increasing the number of scholars conducting criminological and criminal justice studies. Notwithstanding these qualifications, it still is fair to say that the sociology of deviance has lost much of the momentum, vitality, and luster that it possessed in the 1960s. We see Sumner's "obituary" and our empirical findings as a challenge for sociologists to revive the study of deviance, once more struggling to articulate general theories that explain both legal and illegal norm-violating behaviors. Notes 1. Only textbooks published in the United States were included in the study. Readers/antholo gies used in deviance courses were excluded to prevent analyzing overlapping publications. When more than one edition of a sociology of deviance textbook appeared from 1993 to 1999, only the most recent edition was included in the analysis. Our list of textbooks was adapted from Bader, Becker, and Desmond (1996). 2. To date, citation analysts have made no attempt to evaluate the relative prestige of the journals that are examined in their studies. Given that citations in some journals are more prestigious than citations in others, readers must be cautioned that our analysis does not rank journals and weight citations in this fashion. 3. In these journals, we examined all the articles and research notes dealing with any form of norm violating conduct, including studies analyzing alcohol and drug abuse, juvenile delin quency, mental illness, movements of political and religious protest, sexual deviance, street crime, suicide, and white-collar crime. 4. Other publications to appear in the journals (e.g., book reviews, comments, and announce ments) were excluded from our study. 5. To take one hypothetical example, say that Professor X cites himself/herself 150 times in ten publications, and is cited 30 additional times in 15 other publications. The adjusted citation score (50) probably better estimates his/her impact on scholarship than either the extreme number of total citations when self-citations are counted (180), or the modest number of citations received in the publications that he/she didn't write. 6. The textbooks contained far more citations than the articles and research notes, so we calculated adjusted citation scores separately for these publications. For readers who wish to re-rank the most-cited scholars in our study by their unadjusted scores, we also report the data including self-citations in Tables 1 and 3. 7. Works that endorsed a constructionist perspective or that employed ethnographic methods were classified in the sociology of deviance even if they examined only illegal behaviors. This is why John Braithwaite, Richard A. Cloward, Lloyd E. Ohlin, and Raymond Paternoster 56 The American Sociologist / Fall 2001</page><page sequence="15">were classified as "sociologists of deviance" and Braithwaite (1989) and Cloward and Ohlin (I960) were classified as "sociologies of deviance" (see Tables 2 and 4). Braithwaite (1989) and Paternoster and lovanni (1989) have embraced neo-labeling/constructionist perspec tives in their analyses of justice system responses to criminal and delinquent behavior, while Cloward and Ohlin (I960) are well-known for their use of ethnographic methods. 8. We did not use independent coders to check the reliability of our categorizations because coders would not possess the detailed familiarity with many different publications needed to complete the classification process. This was another reason why we chose the strategy of over-identifying scholars/works with the sociology of deviance. 9. All recent citation studies in criminology/criminal justice except Cohn and Farrington (1996) report the most-cited works of selected most-cited scholars?rather than the most cited works of all scholars?in the publications that are analyzed (for example, see Cohn, Farrington, and Wright 1998; Wright 2000). This is why we chose the former study for our comparisons. 10. These 13 works were Akers ([1973] 1985), Becker ([1963] 1973), Cloward and Ohlin (I960), Cohen (1955), Cohen (1985), Foucault (1977), Goffman (1961), Lemert ([1967] 1972), Matza (1964), Rothman (1971, 1980), Sykes and Matza (1957), and Whyte ([1943] 1955). 11. Given the small number of most-cited works identified in our study (3D, it was necessary to combine our data with Cohn and Farrington's (1996) list of the 54 most-cited works in criminology/criminal justice to calculate a statistical test of significance.
