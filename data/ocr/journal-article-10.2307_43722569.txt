Introduction The purpose of this study is to address in a preliminary manner one aspect of this issue of the final product, specifically, the literary arrangement produced by the priestly redactor of Exodus. Diachronic analysis has rarely been joined to a discussion of the synchronic arrangement of the book. To be sure, this approach has been ventured for specific sections, in G. F. Davies's recent analysis of Exodus 1-2, for example,2 and in R. W. L. Moberly's study of Exodus 32-34.3 B. S. Childs has called attention to what he perceives to be the "canonical influence" of the relationship of the various parts of Exo- dus.4 Whatever this influence may have been (it plays no explicit role in the analysis to follow), the agenda proposed here has not been executed for the book as a whole.5 This agenda raises some methodological issues, however. The long-reigning paradigm for examining the diachronic development of Exodus has come under serious attack. For over a century and a half the historical study of Exodus has been pursued by examining the Yahwist source (J), the Elohist source (E), and the Priestly source (P), as well as deuteronomic additions (D or dtr), although these sources have been vigorously debated during this period. Their character and their dating have been heavily controverted in the twentieth century,6 and the revolution within pentateuchal studies within the J. H.

Scholars largely agree that the book shows a significant amount of priestly material, as well as a marked priestly redaction. Some narratives, the genealogies,1 1 many (if not all) of the itinerary notices,12 and the legal (or instructional) literature of Exodus 25-3 1 with its narrative execution in 35-40, as well as numerous glosses, have been generally regarded as priestly. Despite the consensus on these points, pentateuchal scholarship has varied over specific issues involving the priestly material.13 While some scholars argue for 7 Studies with little or no discussion of recent debates have appeared in the United States over the last decade, mainly from students of F M.

Noth, priestly narrative passages were identified, and arguments were made for a continuous narrative priestly source which knew JE as a combined work; this view has been supported in recent years.15 Scholars working out of widely varying frameworks have opposed this position, however. Commentators denying it include M. Lohr, P. Volz, and F. M. Cross, who operate with traditional source-critical assumptions, as well as newer redactional critics such as R. Rendtorff and E.

A priestly redaction of the book has been generally upheld since Well- hausen proposed it.17 Recently, however, R. E. Friedman has remarked that "the redactor of the final work favored P."18 Whether or not a separate P source (as opposed to a series of supplements) is to be maintained, Exodus shows a number of priestly glosses and compositions, and many scholars now maintain a major priestly redaction of the book.19 To date, diachronic discussions have generated relatively few attempts to describe the literary character of the book. Three recent synchronic sugges- tions may be noted. First, B. Jacob presents an arrangement based largely on mathematical considerations.20 According to Jacob's figures, two halves, the first focusing on Egypt and the second on Sinai, tally to 494 and 716 verses. Each half contains three sections; Exod 1:1-7:13; 7:14-11:10; and chaps. 12-18 belong to the first half, while chaps. 19-24, 25-34, and 35-40 belong to the second. Apart from the gross difference in the two halves, this mathematical schema overlooks the break between Moses at Midian in chap. 2 and Moses on the mountain in chap. 3. The division into two major parts has been recognized, however, by a number of scholars.21 It is adopted and modified below. Second, J. P. Fokkelman offers the following structure (omitting the subheadings within these sections):22 exposition, 1:1-6:27; confrontation, 6:28-15:18; introduction: making for Sinai, 15:22-18:27; revelation on Sinai and covenant I, chaps. 19-3 1 ; revelation on Sinai and covenant II, chaps. 32-40. The last two sections of this proposal are defensible on both synchronic and diachronic grounds. As argued below, the priestly redaction of the book likewise made this division and thematically linked these two sections with parts in the first half of the book. The rest of the delineation appears some- what arbitrary by comparison. 17 J. Wellhausen, Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel (German original, 1878; Engl, tr., Gloucester, MA: Peter Smith, 1973) 373-74. In contrast, Noth ( History of Pentateuchal Traditions, 1 1) prescinded from this question. 18 Friedman, "Torah,"617b-618a.

Ker- mode; Cambridge, MA: Belknap, 1987) 57-58.</page><page sequence="6">30 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 58, 1996 Finally, R. J. Clifford suggests the following schema (with the subheadings omitted):23 I. The Hebrews Freed from Pharaoh in Egypt (1: 1-15:21) A. Danger (1:1-2:22) B. God commissions Moses: first narrative (2:23-6:1) C. God commissions Moses: second narrative (6:2-7:7) D. The ten plagues (7:8-13:16) E. The destruction of the Egyptian armies and the thanksgiving of Miriam (13:17-15:21) F. The journey to Sinai and Canaan after the Egyptians have been destroyed (15:22-18:27) II. Israel at Sinai (19:1-40:38) A. Solemn concluding of the covenant (19:1-24:18) B. Divine command to build and maintain the Dwelling (chaps. 25-31) C. Apostasy and renewal of the covenant (chaps. 32-34) D. Building of the Dwelling and the descent of the Glory (chaps. 35-40) Clifford reiterates the notion of two major halves in Exodus, but taking the priestly itinerary notices as fundamental indicators of the "P" arrangement of the book, he suggests two "interlocking" halves, 1 : 1-15:21 and 12:37- 40:38.24 Clifford's delineation of two commissions reflects a long-standing consensus. To anticipate an argument made below, the pair of commissions recognized by Clifford and the double-covenant scheme of chaps. 19-40 observed by Fokkelman mirror one another structurally and thematically within the larger arrangement of the book. Of the three proposals, only Clifford's relates the synchronic arrangement to a diachronic framework, specifically, to the priestly redaction of the book. While Noth correctly sug- gested that further unintended theological insights emerge from this arrange- ment,25 Clifford correctly views the basic arrangement as the result of a planned priestly redaction, as the next section indicates. Before proceeding to the proposal for this arrangement, it is important to raise a few questions about some of Clifford's suggestions. The proposal of "interlocking halves" reflects a fundamental problem of the way in which Exod 13:17-15:21 fits into the larger arrangement, and it will be argued that for the priestly redaction, 15:1-21 serves as the pivoting center of the book. 23 Clifford, M Exodus," 45. 24 Ibid., 44-45. Clifford's analysis of 12:37-40:38 is based largely on Cross, Canaanite Myth. 293-325, esp. 310-14. 25 So Vervenne ("The Tradition in the Pentateuch," 88) asks, "Is what we are inter- preting a deliberate arrangement, or did it occur by accident?"</page><page sequence="7">THE PRIESTLY REDACTION OF EXODUS 31 It may be noted that not all of the itinerary notices function in Clifford's schema as points of major division. More specifically, while the notice in 19: l-2a is a major marker in Clifford's schema, the notices in 12:37; 13:20; and 15:27 are not. Itinerary notices as such are not the markers of the major sections in the priestly redaction, and indeed 19:1 -2a differs from the other three notices. In sum, the three proposals make important contributions toward under- standing the arrangement of Exodus, and Clifford makes his proposal out of diachronic considerations. In this respect, J. Blenkinsopp's comment on Exo- dus 24 applies as well to the priestly redaction of the book: "We do not have to choose between synchronicity and diachronicity."26 II. Methodological Steps for Delineating the Priestly Redaction A. Step One The first step in delineating the priestly arrangement of the Book of Exodus involves the question whether the book may be treated as a unit within the priestly redaction of the Pentateuch. This difficult issue may be addressed by asking to what degree chaps. 1 and 40 demarcate beginning and end points for the priestly redaction. Sarna addresses this issue in general terms, noting that 1:1-7 and 40:36-38 constitute the prologue and epilogue of the book.27 Chapter 1 was a beginning point inherited and expanded by the priestly redaction. While the priestly addition in 1 : 1-7 is designed to connect the Book of Exodus to the Joseph narrative in Genesis,28 there is a thematic break between the books. The priestly material, noting the deaths of those belonging to the old generation in Jacob-Israel's clan (1:6),29 marks the appearance of the people, bène yisrã^êl (1:7). This expansion echoes the first biblical com- mandment, the priestly injunction in Genesis 1:28 to "be fruitful and multi- ply." Furthermore, Exod l:7's use of šrs echoes Gen 1:20-21. In addition, the material inherited by P tells how a new Egyptian king ignorant of the Israel- ites has arisen in place of the old monarch who knew and benefitted Joseph and his family. Hence, chap. 1 appears to mark a new narrative stage. The case for Exodus 40 as a point where a particular break occurs in the priestly redaction is more difficult to make. It is well known that while Gene- sis and Deuteronomy are self-contained units by comparison, Exodus, Levi- ticus, and Numbers are not. It is also clear that the priestly redaction runs 26 Blenkinsopp, Pentateuch, 191. 27 N. M. Sarna, "Exodus, Book of," ABD, 2. 690b. 28 Childs, Book of Exodus, 1-2; Fokkelman, "Exodus," 58. 29 See Blenkinsopp, Pentateuch, 134.</page><page sequence="8">32 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 58, 1996 through these three books. Moreover, it is sometimes argued that Exodus 25- 3 1 and 35-40 cannot be separated from Leviticus 8-9, as Leviticus 8 provides the fulfillment of the command in Exodus 29.30 Finally, the apparent literary structure proposed for Exodus through Numbers creates problems for seeing Exodus 40 as a point where a break occurs. Proposals for the literary struc- ture of the Pentateuch include Milgrom's argument for the general chiastic arrangement of features in Exodus through Numbers, with the Sinai material of Exodus 19 through Numbers 10 standing as the middle and obviously major element.31 Echoing observations of J. Wellhausen, A. Schart has pro- posed a "Ringstruktur" surrounding the Sinai legislation:32 A. Exod 15:22-25 Wasserumwandlung B. 17:1-7 Wasser aus dem Felsen C. 17:8-16 Krieg: A malek- Israel D. 1 8 Entlastung des Mose E. 18:27 Der Midianiter Jitro (TOö ]nn) F. 19:1-2 Ankunft am Sinai Sinai F'. Num 10:11-23 Aufbruch vom Sinai E'. 10:29-32 Der Midianiter Hobab (rnpö jnn) D'. 1 1 Entlastung des Mose C'. 14:39-45 Krieg: Israel- A malek B'. 20:1-13 Wasser aus dem Felsen A'. 21:16-18 Brunnen The general purpose of this arrangement may be discerned by comparing some of its correspondences. The positive aspects of the murmuring stories in Exod 15:22-17:7 in relation to the more negative accents in the murmuring narratives in Numbers 1 1 and 20 would suggest that the material after Sinai in Numbers is, at least in part, the negative image of the material before Sinai in Exodus. The treatment of the Amalekites in Exod 17:8-16 and Num 14:39- 43 follows suit: the first passage witnesses the Israelites' utter defeat of the Amalekites, while the second mentions the Amalekites as victors over the Israelites. Schart also observes that the Israelites' testing Yahweh "these ten times" ( zeh cešer pēcāmīm) in Num 14:22 corresponds to the number of the 30 See V. Hurowitz, / Have Built You an Exalted House: Temple Building in the Bible in the Light of Mesopotamian and Northwest Semitic Writings (JSOTSup 115; JSOT/ASOR Monograph Series 5; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992) 11 1-12; Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16, 61. 11 See J. Milgrom, Numbers: The Traditional Hebrew Text with the New JPS Translation (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia/ New York: Jewish Publication Society, 1990) xvii- xviii. 12 Schart, Mose und Israel im Konflikt, 52.</page><page sequence="9">THE PRIESTLY REDACTION OF EXODUS 33 plagues in the priestly redaction of Exodus.33 Finally, and perhaps most impressively, the itinerary notices in Exodus and Numbers largely balance: seven notices chart the Israelites' journey from Egypt to Sinai in Exodus (Exod 12:37a; 13:20; 14:1; 15:22a; 16:1; 17:1; 19:2) and five notices follow the Israelites from Sinai to the plains of Moab in Numbers (Num 10:12; 20:1a; 20:22; 21:10; 22: l).34 While these notices were not definitive in marking larger units within the priestly redaction, they indicate smaller units of material within it. Through them the priestly redaction evidently indicates balance and correspondence between the two journeys to and from Sinai. It may be suggested further that these correspondences between the narratives from Egypt to Sinai in Exodus and from Sinai to Moab in Numbers serve a larger thematic purpose. The narrative material in the Book of Numbers shows an inverse relationship to the narrative in Exodus (cf. Jude 5). Or, in Scharťs formulation, the material of A to F reflects "Strafverzicht Jahwes, Israel lebt," while F' to A' reflects "Strafe und Zorn Jahwes, Israel von Ver- nichtung bedroht." The material before Sinai and the material after Sinai reflect positive-negative mirror images of Israel. Extending the chiastic ar- rangement of Milgrom and Schart, we may argue that Exodus 25-31 + 35-40 corresponds to Numbers 1-10 in that both sections deal with the divine sanc- tuary. Exodus 25-3 1 + 35-40, the first priestly legislation after the arrival at Sinai, deals with the construction of the divine sanctuary, while Numbers 1-10 addresses the arrangements for travel with the divine sanctuary, the final legislation before the departure from Sinai. As a result of these observations, any claim for Exodus 40 as material effecting a break must be situated within a larger discussion of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. By the same token, it is necessary to point out that the larger chiastic arrangement does not exclude additional literary struc- tures. D. Olson has presented structural evidence for the coherence of the Book of Numbers as a separate work,35 and the same kind of work may be done for the Book of Exodus. Although the canonical approach used by Olson ultimately subordinates historical and redactional considerations to putative canonical ones, his study shows the importance of two censuses, in Numbers 1 and 26, for structuring the Book of Numbers, apart from the 33 A.

Similar arrange- ments) may be present in Exodus. Closer examination of the legal corpus suggests that within the larger priestly redaction of Exodus through Numbers, Exodus 40 does constitute a break, or at least a caesura, in the narrative. If Leviticus 1-7 represents an addition placed between the material on the tabernacle in Exodus and in Leviticus 8-9, as was noted above, then it must be observed that this addition alters the shape of the material preceding and following it.36 This change in the priestly redaction of Exodus and Leviticus calls for explanation. Further- more, internal and external considerations suggest that the priestly redaction signals a narrative caesura or break at the end of chap. 40. Internally, the legal material in Exod 40:33a ends a long section pertaining to the taber- nacle, and a priestly narrative, 40:33b-38, divides the tabernacle material from the sacrificial materials beginning in Leviticus 1. With the work on the tabernacle finished (40:33b), the divine cloud covers the ^ õhel môcëd , and the (, kâbôd ), the divine "glory" or "effulgence,"37 fills the miskān (Exod 40:34). Moses' relationship to Yahweh is thereby changed: he no longer enters the J õhel môcêd to communicate with Yahweh, and a new stage in the divine- human communication is reached (40:35). The entry of the deity into the sanctuary marks the conclusion of a set pattern in temple and palace building.38 Instead of the simple past forms of the previous verses, durative past prefix verbal forms are used in the final verses of the book (40:36-38) to describe how the movements of the wilderness journeys were signalled by the divine "cloud." According to Milgrom, this is intrusive material which, together with Num 9:15-23, forms a bracket around the intervening material.39 The result is that the bracketing function of Exod 40:36-38 signals a break be- tween the books of Exodus and Leviticus. Externally, contacts between the priestly account of creation in Gen 1:1-2:3 and Exodus 39-40 indicate that the end of Exodus marks a break in the Sinai legislation. Commentators, beginning with Martin Buber and Franz Rosen- zweig, have observed that Exodus 39-40 is consciously made to echo the end of the priestly account of creation (Exod 39:43a || Gen 1:31a; Exod 39:32a || 36 For a synchronic explanation of this apparent displacement, see Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16, 494. Note the opposite approach of Levine, who regards Exod 29:1-37 as "a response to Leviticus 8," and Exod 29:38-46 as "a probable response" to Num 28:1-8 "in requiring two tāmīd sacrifices" (B. Levine, Review of Leviticus 1-16 by J. Milgrom, Bib 74 [1994] 283). 17 So Blenkinsopp, Pentateuch, 219. See Cross, Canaanite Myth, 153 n. 30. 18 See V.

For the priestly tradition, Sinai represents the site of the definitive covenant and model for later cultic remembrances. The concluding formulas of Exod 39:32 and 40:33 echoing Gen 2: 1-2, 41 signal, for the priestly tradition, a definitive covenantal moment in the religious history of Israel. In sum, the specifically priestly elements in the first and final chapters of Exodus signal two new beginnings at the two ends of the book- a first beginning of the Israelite people in Egypt, and a second beginning of their life with Yahweh taber- nacling in their midst. Ã Step Two The second step in delineating the literary arrangement of the priestly redaction is to demonstrate the extent of the priestly redaction throughout the book.42 The priestly redaction of Exodus is regarded generally as major in character, but the facts basic to this view deserve mention. The priestly shaping of the material from Exod 6:2 through chap. 12 is evident from the priestly call narrative of 6:2-7:7 (incorporating the genealogy of Moses and Aaron) and the priestly redaction of the plague narrative.43 The next piece of evidence is constituted by the itinerary notices, which in Exodus structure material from the departure from Egypt to the arrival at Sinai. More specifically, the itinerary notices in 12:37a; 13:20; 15:22a; 15:27; 16:1; 17:1; 19:l-2a provide the order and arrangement for the intervening 40 For discussion of Buber and Rosenzweig, see Blum, Studien , 306-7.

The third piece of evidence for the priestly redaction of the book in- volves Exodus 19-40. That the arrangement is due to priestly redaction is indicated by the priestly reuse of the deuteronomic motif of the tablets. It is possible that the motif of the tablets was originally deuteronomic,47 but in Exodus the motif is patently priestly. Exod 31:18, as well as Exod 32:15 and 34:29, contain the expression lûhôt hācēdūt, "tablets of the pact," which is the priestly designation as opposed to the deuteronomic lûhôt habběrít, "the tablets of the covenant" (Deut 9:9,1 1,1 5).48 The priestly redactor has adopted the motif of the tablets for his own redactional purposes in 31:18, which, as its freestanding character suggests, closes the section.49 Through the motif of the tablets the priestly redaction covers Exodus 6 through Exodus 40. Finally, from the priestly glosses in Exodus 1-2, it appears that the priestly redactor inherited and incorporated the structure of 1 : 1 -6: 1 into the larger redactional plan from 6:2 through the end of chap. 40. C. Step Three The third step in identifying the priestly arrangement of material in Exodus is to identify the major sectional divisions that the priestly redaction used or created. 1. Exod l:l-2:25.50 The division between the end of chap. 2 and the beginning of chap. 3 is the first of the two nonpriestly divisions which the priestly redactor inherited. Fokkelman argues that 2:23-25 provides a transi- tion to the following section.51 That chapters 1-2 are self-contained is sug- gested by a thematic frame: the section begins with the genealogical list of 44 Cross, Canaanite Myth, 310-12. 45 Ibid., 311-12, 314. 46 Noth ( History of Pentateuchal Traditions, 30) attributes 12:37a and 13:20 to J. 47 So Noth, Exodus, 247. 4X M.

Exod 6:2-13: 16.55 The priestly call passage separates 6:2-3 from the preceding section. Exod 13:16 marks the end of the plague narrative, and Exod 13:17 marks the beginning of the scene at the sea. At this point in the narrative, therefore, two separate sections appear to be demarcated in the priestly redaction. 4. Exod 13: 17- 15:21.56 Exod 15:19 shows so much similarity to Exod 14:29, customarily assigned to P, that a priestly redactional setting for the poem appears indicated. So B. S. Childs comments that "the close parallel [of Exod 15:19] to the Priestly source - the last colon has been taken verba- tim from 14.29 - would point rather to the work of the final Priestly editor."57 5. Exod 15:22- 18:27. 58 The priestly itinerary notices of 15:22 and 19:1 -2a delimit this unit for the priestly redaction.59 The priestly itinerary notice in 19:l-2a separates the prepriestly material in 15:22-18:27 from that of chaps. 19 and 24. 52 For the following points, see Davies, Israel in Egypt, 20. 53 There is no priestly material in this section. See Noth, Exodus, 38-56; Childs, Book of Exodus, 51-53; Campbell and O'Brien, Sources of the Pentateuch, 132-36, esp. 131 n. 92. 54 See Childs, Book of Exodus, 51. 55 Priestly material in this section: 6:2-7:7; 7:8-13,19-20a,21b-22; 8:1-3 (/?SK5-7),1 lb (.

Noth adds 9:22, 23aa and 10:12,13aa,20-22. Childs assigns only 9:35b to P. 56 Priestly material in this section: 14: 1-4, 8ab, 9b, 10a, 15-18, 21-23, 26-27, 28ab, 29; 15:19.

Excluding minor variations, Childs ( Book of Exodus, 220) also assigns 13:20 to P, while Vervenne ("The łPł Tradition in the Pentateuch," 85) adds to P 13:20; 14:1 1-12,31. For 15:19 as P, see Childs, Book of Exodus, 248. 57 Childs, Book of Exodus, 248 (italics his). 58 Priestly material in this section: 15:22a, 27; 16: l-35a; 17:1a.

According to Childs ( Book of Exodus, 266, 275), the priestly material in this section consists of 15:22aa,27; 16: 1-3,6-1 3a, 32-35aa,b; 17: laba.

Exodus 1 9-3 1 ;60 Exodus 32-40.61 The priestly redactor used the motif of the two sets of tablets to create these units, as was noted above. III. A Preliminary Proposal for the Literary Arrangement of the Priestly Redaction The markers examined above delineate sections in a way which shows an overall arrangement. Proceeding from these presuppositions, we may outline the priestly redactional arrangement of Exodus in the following manner: I. Egypt A. Exodus 1-2: Moses' movement from Egypt to Midian B. Two calls and two confrontations 1. Exod 3:1-6:1: Moses' first call; Moses* confrontation with Pharaoh l'. Exod 6:2-14:31: Moses' second call; Yahweh's confrontation with Pha- raoh The conflict between the powers of Egypt and Sinai C. Exod 15:1-21: Victory at the sea II. Sinai A'. Exod 15:22-18:27: Israel's movement from Egypt to Midian B'. Two covenants and two sets of tablets 1. Exodus 19-31: Israel's first covenant with Yahweh; the first tablets 1 '. Exodus 32-40: Israel's second covenant with Yahweh; the second tab- lets In the most general terms, the book contains two larger parts divided geo- graphically. As J. D. Levenson has suggested, Egypt, the land of the power of Pharaoh, is the setting for the first half of Exodus, while Sinai, the realm of Yahweh's power, dominates the second half of the book.62 Moreover, in the two halves of the book the life of Moses and the life of the Israelites are parallel in somewhat general terms: both Moses and the Israelites flee Egypt, and both Moses and the Israelites come to the divine mountain and receive the divine word. The conflict in the middle of the book resolves the struggle 60 Priestly material in chaps. 1 9-3 1 : 1 9: 1 -2a,5bß-6a, 1 1 b, 1 2aß- 1 3, 1 5b, 1 6aa, 1 8(?), 20-25; 24: 1 - 2,6,8-1 1(?), 15b- 18a; 25:1-31:18; so, for chaps. 19 and 24, Dozeman, God on the Mountain, 106-36. Noth ( Exodus , 155, 200; see Campbell and O'Brien, Sources of the Pentateuch, 43-52) assigns to P 19:1 -2a; 24: 1 5b- 18; and chaps. 25-31 (with 29:1-31:17 as secondary expansions of the priestly document). In chap. 19 Noth regards vv 3-8 as E, vv 10-15 as J, vv 16-20 as JE, and vv 21-25 as secondary. 61 The priestly material comprises chaps. 35-40, according to Noth ( Exodus , 274-75; see Campbell and O'Brien, Sources of the Pentateuch, 53-61), with several secondary elements. 62 J. D. Levenson, The Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, and Historical Criticism: Jews and Christians in Biblical Studies (Louisville: Westminster/ John Knox, 1993) 127-59.</page><page sequence="15">THE PRIESTLY REDACTION OF EXODUS 39 between these two domains. With Yahweh's victory at the sea, the power of the One of Sinai is made fully manifest. Or, to use a formulation of Leven- son's, the Israelites were cabādīm, "slaves, servants," to Pharaoh in Egypt, and at Sinai they become câbâdîm to Yahweh. While this schema holds generally, it should be noted that Sinai plays a role already in the first part, in Moses' initial commission, which anticipates the role the mountain will play in the second half of the book. Even in the first half Sinai looms as the ultimate goal (Exod 3: 12). Finally, this schema highlights the central, pivotal place of Exod 15:1-21 within the priestly redaction of the book. In its redac- tional context, this poem recapitulates the events leading up to the victory at the sea (vv 1-12) and anticipates the events at the mountain following the victory (vv 13-18). V. Brief Remarks on the Priestly Arrangement in Specific Sections A. The Parallel Natures of A and A', B and B Sections A and A' describe the circumstances leading to the arrival of Moses and the people at the mountain. Section A presents the shared origins of Moses and Israel in Egypt and anticipates their shared destiny on the mountain. The section ends by bringing Moses to the land of Midian, to the area of the divine mountain, just as the wilderness narrative in section A' brings Moses and the people to Sinai.63 Another piece of evidence may suggest the narrative parallelism between sections A and A'. Exod 18:3 shows a connection with 2:22 through the etiology for the name Gershom.64 In contrast, the putative quotation attached to the birth of Moses' second son Eliezer in 18:4 has no antecedent and refers to the exodus in general. It might be suggested then that, taken together, the quotations attached to the names of the two sons recapitulate events up to chap. 18. The name of the first son focuses on the identity of Moses, and that of the second focuses on the identity of Israel; in the present context, the kinship of the two sons may symbolize the interconnected character of the origins and destinies of Moses and the people whom he serves. Sections B and B' are by their very length and nature extremely com- plex; only some relatively brief suggestions may be advanced. In sections B and B' both Moses and the people encounter Yahweh and receive the divine 63 So Clifford, "Exodus," 44. 64 The older referent may have been the itinerant status of at least some Levitical priests suggested by Judg 17:7, which mentions that a nacar had come from Judah, "and he was a Levite, and he was sojourning there" (wëhû^ lêwî wěhů* gār-šām).

Stager, "The Archaeology of the Family in Ancient Israel," BASOR 260 (1985) 26.</page><page sequence="16">40 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 58, 1996 words on the mountain. Childs's observation regarding hassěneh (3:2-3) and sînay points to the fundamental symmetry between B and B'.65 It is the use of Sinai, rather than "the mountain of Elohim,"66 to designate the mountain which fully develops and exploits the sign value of hassěneh. The priestly redactor used the old explanation of 3:12 informing Moses that he would return to this mountain with the people. Furthermore, the two commissions of Moses in chaps. 3 and 6 suggest a basic structural parallel between 3: 1-6: 1 and 6:2-14:31, just as the two sets of tablets in chaps. 19-40 suggest a struc- tural parallel between chaps. 19-31 and chaps. 32-40. These parallels un- derlie the designations B.l (3:1-6:1) and B. 1 ' (6:2- 14:3 1), B'.l (chaps. 19-31) and B'. 1' (chaps. 32-40). One function of these parallels between the life of Moses and that of Israel is that of making Moses' life a model for Israel's appropriate response to Yahweh. His own commission and mission antici- pate the mission and identity of Israel as Yahweh's servant. B. Two Calls and Two Confrontations Section B.l is parallel to section B.l' within the priestly redaction. This parallel relationship is suggested primarily by the calls in Exod 3:1-6:1 and 6:2-14:31. Childs,67 following older commentators such as Alt,68 notes the "striking similarity in the form of the two narratives which includes commis- sion, objection, divine response, and sign, which would confirm its parallel role." Yet Childs stresses that while the two calls were originally parallel, they now stand in sequential order, as the different locations of the two encounters between Moses and Yahweh-Elohim indicate. Section B.l' in its present set- ting serves as the priestly filter on material in B.l. This goal is achieved less by material alteration than by the priestly redactor's juxtaposition of the priestly material in section B.l' to nonpriestly material in section B.l. In D. Damrosch's study of narrative in the Pentateuch and the deuterono- mistic history, he notes biblical rereading produced by redactional juxtapo- sition of materials: Certainly it is not necessary to return to the old view, no longer widely held among historians, that the later "redactors" did little to shape their material, but it is reasonable to agree that the later composers of the text did not have com- plete freedom in their appropriation of the older material. Sometimes the later 65 Childs, Book of Exodus, 56-60; D.

The results of this reading may be summarized. The initial call and mission involved material of JE; this time the P redactor presents a further version of the mission to which he adds the traditions of the plagues proper to JE and P.70 Unlike the first call, this one is distinctly priestly in character. The priestly redactor postpones J's version of the miracles in order to place the wonders of the JE version together with those of the priestly version, following the P version of the call and commis- sion. The function of this postponement is to mark two stages in the conflict between the powers of Egypt and Sinai. In section B.l the conflict is staged between Pharaoh and Moses, but in section B.l' the conflict moves to an- other level as a conflict between Pharaoh and Yahweh. The conflict in section B.l' marked with divine signs and wonders is due to P's arrangement of the JE material. This view of the general parallels of sections B. 1 and B. l' created by the priestly redaction may be supported by a more detailed explanation. The basic priestly commission begins and ends with the basic statement "I am Yahweh" (6:2b, 8b). This statement represents the foundational basis for Yah- weh's relationship with Israel.71 Exod 6:3a identifies the name by which Yah- weh was not yet revealed: ûsëmîyhwh lõ^nôdaW, "but by my name the Lord I did not make myself known" ( RSV ).72 Exod 6:3 uses the word "name" (šēm) with the pronominal (suffixal) subject. According to Garr, the gram- matical apposition between the deity and the name in Exod 6:3 expresses a relationship of identity (cf. smk in CTA 2.4.1 lb- 12, 19). The theme of knowledge also represents a deeper expression of revela- tion in the priestly material. In Exod 6:4-9 the knowledge of Yahweh is con- nected to the divine conquest of Egypt, the concomitant liberation of the Israelites from slavery, and finally the granting of the land. This section 69 Damrosch, Narrative Covenant, 304 (italics his). See Zevit, "Priestly Redaction/* 193-211. 71 For the priestly background of the expression "I am Yahweh," see W. Zimmerli, "I Am Yahweh - Knowledge of God according to the Book of Ezekiel," / am Yahweh (Atlanta: John Knox, 1982) 1-28, esp. 2-13. 72 The M/Khas essentially the same translation, also taking the N-stem form as reflexive. W. R. Garr ("The Grammar and Interpretation of Exodus 6:3 " JBL 1 1 1 [1992] 385) renders the passage this way: "but, I, my name Yahweh, was not known to them."</page><page sequence="18">42 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 58, 1996 identifies the plagues as šēpātīm gèdõlím , "great deeds" (6:6; 7:4), a priestly expression applied to divine deeds against foreign nations (12:12; cf. Ezek 5:10, 15; 8:22,26; 1 1:9; 14:21; 25:1; 30:14,19; 39:41). The priestly material extends the theme of the hardening of Pharaoh's heart from the plague narrative to this section in order to show further Yahweh's control over the Israelites' destiny.73 The priestly statement "they shall know that I am Yahweh" (and its variations) first appears in this commission (Exod 6:7). This formula ap- pears in the conflict between Pharaoh and Yahweh in the older material in the plague narrative (e.g., 7:17; 8:18; 9:14,16,29; 14:31); in the priestly mate- rial it is extended to other persons in the book (14:18; 16:6,12; 18:1 1; 25:22; 29:43; 31:18) perhaps as an expression of monolatry.74 The second block of material (Exod 6:9-7:7) introduces Aaron into the commission (6:9-13), inserts the genealogy of Moses and Aaron (6:14-25), resumes the narrative (6:27-30), and finally represents the commission as a joint mission of Moses and Aaron (7:1-7). The genealogy gives to Aaron a precedence which, as S. R. Driver noted, extends into priestly additions of three kinds in the plague narratives, (1) the formula "say to Aaron" (7:9,19; 8:5,16; 9:8); (2) Pharaoh's not listening to "them" (i.e., Moses and Aaron, 7:22; 8: 15b, 19; 9:12; cf. 7:13); (3) Aaron's role as spokesman before Pharaoh (in contrast to Moses' speaking alone in 4:10-16).75 The immediate effect of the genealogy and the surrounding material is that of transforming not only the initial commission in Exodus 3, but also the commission in 6:2-8 into the commission of a pair, Moses and Aaron (7:1-7). The repetitions of 6:2-8 found in 7:1-7 comport with this view: wîdactem/wëyâdëcû kî ^ânî yhwh, "and you/they shall know I am Yahweh" (Exod 6:7; 7:5); šēpātīm gèdõlím , "great deeds" (Exod 6:6; 7:4); raising (nāšā*tī)&gt; giving ( wěnaíattí ), and ex- tending (bintõtí) the divine "hand" ( yad ) (Exod 6:8; 7:4,5); the divine claim "I will bring out " (wèhôsêW) the Israelites "from under the burdens of Egypt/ the land of Egypt" ( mittahat siblôt misrayim / meteres misrayim, 6:6; 7:4). Like the call in 6:2-7:7, the priestly plagues in section B.l' (7:8-1 1:10) modify the character of section B. 1 . One change involves the priestly redac- tion's restricting the plagues to section B.l', but the priestly plagues make a more specific thematic contribution to the understanding of the mission to Pharaoh. The priestly plagues (7:8-13,1 9-20a,2 1 b-22; 8:1-3,1 lb, 12-15; 9:8- 12,35b; 1 1:9-10) proceed in four stages: (1) Yahweh gives Moses instructions necessary to produce the plagues; (2) instructions follow, and the plague 73 R.

Other priestly examples of this formula can be found in Ezekiel. 75 Driver, Introduction, 24.</page><page sequence="19">THE PRIESTLY REDACTION OF EXODUS 43 begins; (3) the Egyptian magicians attempt to duplicate the plague and either fail or succeeed; (4) whatever the result of the magicians' attempt is, the heart of Pharaoh is hardened.76 It is impossible to detail here the full effect of the addition of the plague narrative to the second commission,77 but the combina- tion highlights the narrative's movement from a confrontation between Pha- raoh and Moses in the first commission (B.l) to warfare between Pharaoh and Yahweh beginning with the second commission and ending with the last plague (B.T), which leads finally to the defeat of Egypt at the sea (C). C. The Conflict between the Powers of Egypt and Sinai In the priestly redaction of Exodus, the middle section, C (Exod 15:1- 21), consisting mainly of the poem, serves as more than a climax in the account of the destruction of the Egyptians. It is true that the poem in Exodus 15 stands in a relationship to its narrative similar to that of either Judges 5 or Numbers 22-24 to its context: just as the poems of Deborah and Balaam are attached to the specific location where they appear in the nar- rative, so the poem in Exodus 15 stands at the point in the book where the Israelites journey across the sea. Like Judges 5, it is a victory hymn attached to the narrative of the victory.78 This approach explains the placement of the poem only in part, how- ever, as Exod 15:13-18 does not bear on the victory described in the preceding narrative. These verses have been explained as anticipating events after the Egyptians' defeat. Cross and Childs note that nahîtâ (v 13) refers to the journey following the victory at the sea.79 R. Alter links the swallowing ( blc ) of Korah in Num 16:30 with the swallowing ( blc ) of the enemy in Exod 15:12. With little justification other than a most general thematic link, Alter adds that this motif "may also point forward, metaphorically rather than literally, to the fate of the Canaanites."80 More specific affinities of vv 13-17 with 76 Wilson, "Hardening of Pharaoh's Heart " 34. 77 For an interpretation of the priestly plague material, as well as the priestly redaction of the plagues section, in light of Gen 1 : 1 -2:4a, see Zevit, " Priestly Redaction, " 193-21 1 .

Watts, who suggests that these verses "reflect the language of subsequent accounts."81 With this approach the "anticipatory character" of 15:13-17 is noted, but the suggested relationship between 15:13-18 and the following narrative lacks the specificity of the relationship between 15:1-12 and the narrative account of the crossing at the sea. Further answers to this question might come from an examination of the setting which the poem may serve in its present context. Childs makes essentially this point: "Regardless of its prehistory, the funda- mental issue is to determine the effect of joining the poem to the preceding narrative"82 (and to the following narrative as well, as we shall see). The song may be divided into two parts, vv 1-12 and vv 13-18. 83 These two parts mir- ror one another in theme and poetics. The content of v 12 belongs with that of the preceding verses, and the Egyptians in the first half of the poem correspond to the enemies named in the second half.84 While the referent of Exod 15:17 has been understood generally as a sanctuary in the land,85 it is not clear that the priestly redactor interpreted 81 Watts, Psalm and Story, 41-62. 82 Childs, Book of Exodus, 248. 83 The division of the poem into two basic parts, vv 1-12 and vv 13-18, is found in Cross, Canaanite Myth, 127-31; Childs, Book of Exodus, 252; McCarter, "Exodus," 146; Clifford, "Exodus," 50; M.

Driver (The Book of Exodus in the Revised Version [Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911] 129-40; reference courtesy of M.

For Jerusalem, see Targum Onkelos at v 17, traditional commentaries noted by Sarna, Exodus, 248 n. 57, Childs, Book of Exodus, 252. The poem assumed its final form when it was used for worship in Jerusalem under the united monarchy (so Freedman, Pottery, Poetry, and Prophecy, 195). A late setting is posited also by many scholars who perceive Jerusalemite theology as well as parallels with much later texts. For examples, see H. Spieckermann, Heilsgegenwart: Eine Theologie der Psalmen (FRLANT 148; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1989) 101-14.

B. Halpern suggests that for P, Sinai was the referent of the mountain in Exod 15: 16-17.86 The identification of Sinai as the mountain likely predated the priestly redaction of Exodus. For Exod 3:12, usually assigned to E in traditional source criticism, the goal of the journey is not the land, as in many other accounts,87 but the mountain of God which is located in the wilderness.88 The priestly redactor could have understood the mountain in 15:17 in the same way. There are two reasons for supposing that the priestly redactor under- stood Sinai as the mountain in Exod 15: 17. The first reason is structural. The mountain may not have played such a central role in the prepriestly strata of Exodus, but with the older mountain traditions of Exodus 3 and 32-34 now set at Sinai and the priestly insertion of Exod 19:1 -Num 10:28, Sinai domi- nates not only the second half of the book but also the book as a whole. The second reason, related to the first, is theological. It is a gross understatement to say Sinai occupies a central place in the priestly theology of the Penta- teuch. As Noth has commented, "the P narrative is not oriented toward an impending occupation of the land; rather, its real goal was reached with the presentation of the regulations established at Sinai."89 Noth may have over- stated the case, for Sinai anticipates the land, but in the priestly theology Sinai defines how life inside and outside the land is to be led. Indeed, the promises of progeny and land play important roles in the priestly theology (Gen l:l-2:4a). Sinai is not only proleptic of the land; it also defines it. With the priestly insertion of Exod 19:1 -Num 10:28, Sinai became the Mount Everest of priestly theology, a mountain looming larger than other sacred sites like Jerusalem. For the priestly tradition Sinai represented the definitive covenant and was the model for cultic recollect on in the land. For the priestly tradition the conclusion formula of Exod 39:32 and 40:33, echoing Gen 2: 1-2, 90 signals a definitive covenantal moment in the religious history of Israel. While Exod 15: 17 may have referred originally to a sanctuary in the land, the verse newly interpreted for its present setting now refers primarily to Sinai (and proleptically to the land), in accordance with the priestly structuring and materials in Exodus 19-40. Three details in Exod 15:13-18 may, accordingly, have been reinter- preted by the priestly redactor. First, yacâbõr in Exod 15:16 may have been viewed as a verbal reference to the crossing of the wilderness on the way to 86 Halpern, Emergence of Israel in Canaan, 38-39. 87 Exod 3:8,17; 34:11-12 (see McCarter, "Exodus," 130); Deut 26:5-11; Josh 24:7-8; Ps 105:37-45. See also Psalm 114 and Isa 51:9-11. 88 McCarter, "Exodus," 130. 89 Noth, History of Pentateuchal Traditions, 9. 90 Blenkinsopp, Pentateuch, 217-18.</page><page sequence="22">46 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 58, 1996 Sinai. The root cbr is used of crossing land in Deut 2:18, and the phrase cbr b- appears in Num 20:17; 21:22; Deut 2:4,27,30.91 Second, the reaction of the peoples in Exod 15:14-16 may have been understood secondarily as a fearful response at a great distance. The foreign peoples' reaction now shows the miraculous character of the fear which the Israelite god's reputation could inspire in these peoples at such a distance. The theme of Israelite victories heard of at a distance is found in Josh 2:9-10 as well. Other passages likewise indicate that the Israelites are preceded by the reputation of their victories (Exod 18:1; Josh 5:1; cf. Deut 2:25; Josh 9:1). While the similarities of language in Josh 5:1 and Exod 15:15-16 militate in favor of the opinion that Exod 15:15 refers to the crossing of the Jordan,92 the point here is that the theme of fear inspired at a great distance could be present in Exod 15: 14- 16 in accordance with an understanding of Sinai as the mountain of v 17. Third, miqqědaš of Exod 15: 17 was perhaps understood as the tabernacle of Exodus 25-31; 35-40, which is called miqdäs in Exod 25:8. In sum, for the priestly redactor the victory at the sea stands at a fulcrum point in Exodus. The poem in Exodus 15 recapitulates the events of the previous chapters and anticipates the events of the following chapters. Verses 1-12 refer generally to the events leading up to, and including, the victory at the sea, specifically, to the first half of the book. Verses 13-18 in their present context, in contrast to their original setting, anticipate events following the victory at the sea, events placed in the second half of the book (sections B'.l and B'. l'). £&gt;. Two Covenants and Two Sets of Tablets The materials in sections B'.l and B'.l' (Exodus 19-40) present numerous critical difficulties, some recognized since the Middle Ages.93 Only a few points relevant to the priestly delineation of this section can be noted. The minimum consensus for chaps. 19-40 assumes the original independence of the Ten Commandments (20: 1-1 7), 94 the Covenant Code (20:22-23:33), 95 and 91 I thank Professor Michael Fishbane for bringing this usage to my attention. 92 R. de Vaux, Histoire ancienne d'Israël l: Des origines à l'installation en Canaan (Paris: Gabalda, 1971) 362-64; Howell, "Song of Salvation," 148. 91 Rashi observed that the section beginning with 24:1 precedes the Decalogue (see M. Rosenbaum and A. M. Silbermann, Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, Haphtaroth and Rashi 's Commentary [ Jerusalem: Silbermann Family, 1930] 128). Rashi also noted the narrative tensions between chaps. 19 and 20 (see Rashi on Exod 20:19 in Rosenbaum and Silbermann, Pentateuch, 106). 94 For the Decalogue, see the essays of M. Weinfeld, A.

Segal; Jerusalem: Magnes,</page><page sequence="23">THE PRIESTLY REDACTION OF EXODUS 47 the instructions for the tabernacle (chaps. 25-31 + 35-40). It has been customary to divide Exodus 19-40 into chaps. 19-24 and chaps. 25-40, for the obvious reason that chaps. 25-3 1 and chaps. 35-40 correspond to one another (generally speaking, chaps. 25-3 1 contain the instructions which are executed in chaps. 35-40).96 The usual separation of 25:12 through chap. 31 from 19: 1-24: 1 1 yields a somewhat misleading view of the priestly redaction, however. Although the legal materials of chaps. 19-40 were separate origi- nally, in the priestly redaction 19:1-24:11 belongs to the larger unit 19:1- 31:18 (see below). The priestly redactor inherited 19:3-24:11 and incorporated it into his larger arrangement.97 Exod 24:12-18 is linked to the preceding material, as Exod 24:12 identifies the stone tablets as the medium of the previous "teaching and commandments" of chaps. 20-23. Exod 24:1 1 does not close the narrative. The narrative remains unconcluded at that point because Moses is with Yahweh, not with the people. Furthermore, the motif of the tablets is used to determine the end of the legislative unit in the priestly redaction. As noted above, the priestly verse Exod 31:18 is redactional, and its function in the priestly redaction is to conclude not only the material beginning in Exod 24:12-18, but also 19:1-24:11.

Recent redactional studies of them are Dozeman, God on the Mountain; B. Renaud, La théo- phanie du Sinai, Ex 19-24: Exégèse et Théologie (CahRB 30; Paris: Gabalda, 1991). Scholars using these redactional approaches posit a final priestly redactor. Although they attribute a great deal of material, especially in chaps. 19 and 24, to a major deuteronomic redaction, some of the material attributed to deuteronomic redaction is perhaps to be attributed to the priestly redac- tion, in which earlier deuteronomic material was reused or deuteronomic ideas were incorpo- rated. This approach may explain not only the priestly lûhôt hācēdūt, an apparent reformulation of the deuteronomic lûhôt habběrít (as noted above), but also gôy qãdôs instead of the deu- teronomic cam qadóš . The priestly phrase gôy gãdõl occurs in Gen 12:2; 17:20; Num 14:12. It may be suspected that in the expression gôy qãdôs the priestly redactor has conflated cam qãdôs and gôy gãdõl. That would account for the retention of the negative presentation of Aaron and the championing of the Levites in an Aaronid redaction of Exodus 32.</page><page sequence="24">48 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 58, 1996 secure further the bond between 19:1-24:11 and 24:12-31:18, the priestly redactor may have placed the vision of the divine abode in 24:9-1 1 in order to provide a secondary connection to the instructions for the miškān begin- ning in chap. 25.98 Indeed, the "seeing" ( mar^eh ) in Exod 25:9 continues the vision of the heavenly abode gained in Exod 24: 10b," a connection including chaps. 25-31 as part of the revelation on the tablets, just as Exod 24:3 con- tinues the dèbârîm and mispātīm of chaps. 20-23. Cohen notes that the priestly redactional comments of Exod 25:8-9,40; 26:30; 27:8b "have been added to the original PI [priestly instruction] materials" in Exodus 25-27 in order to connect those materials thematically with the narrative account of Moses' ascent to Sinai (Exod 24:12-18).,0° He argues also that Exod 25:1-7 "cannot be part of PI for stylistic and contextual reasons," one reason being that PI does not use first person speech. The implication is that this passage has been created to provide a transition from the end of chap. 24 to the instruc- tional material commencing in 25: 10. This narrative transition extends to 25:8-9, since the first-person speech of those verses also indicates their nonin- structional character. While the legal material and some of the narrative material in chaps. 19-24 existed prior to the priestly redaction, their present formation exists only as part of the priestly redactional schema of chaps. 19- 31 and 32-40. As was noted above, the final formation of section B', l' (Exodus 32-40) resulted from a secondary ordering by the priestly redactor. By resorting to the schema of the two sets of tablets, the priestly redactor incorporated the older material of chaps. 32-34. 101 In doing so, he addressed the important priestly issue of divine proximity to the Israelites. Both Exodus 24 and Exodus 33-34 use cultic visionary language as a means of exploring Israel's relationship with its deity. Indeed, the accounts of Exod 33:12-23 and Exod 34:6-8 explore the meaning of the relatively static report of Exod 24: 10. 102 More specifically, Exod 33:17-23 and Exod 34:6-8 address the vision of God as it is presented in Exod 24:9-1 1.

This presents a paradigm of divine accessibility which is amenable ultimately to priestly concerns: Yah- weh is indeed accessible, but not in a direct manner. For the Israelite commu- nity this access is governed by the procedures outlined in chaps. 35-40. The narrative and the legal materials provide a new way for a sinning Israel and a holy Yahweh to dwell together.103 With the tabernacle completed at the end of chap. 40, a new stage in Israel's relationship with Yahweh begins. The divine glory fills the new divine dwelling place, "a sign that the new 'creation' has been achieved."104 E. The Arrangement of the Book of Exodus as a Whole This discussion of the literary arrangement of the priestly redaction of Exodus may close with a brief consideration of the book's arrangement as a whole. In the parallels between the two halves of the book Egypt and Israel are contrasted with one another. While both the Egyptians and the Israelites are peoples who receive divine messages through Moses, the treatment which they receive at the hands of Yahweh could hardly differ more. Whereas Pharaoh hardens his heart and his army is destroyed, the Israelites worship the golden calf but receive a second chance. More fundamentally, the two halves of the book contrast Israel in Egypt with Israel at Sinai, the Israel of slavery with the Israel of freedom. Two priestly glosses, 25:22 and 29:42b-46, similarly highlight the role of Egypt and Sinai. The gloss in 29:42b-46 shows that for the priestly redactor the purpose of the exodus was to enable the Israelites' deity to dwell among them: "they shall know that I the Lord am their God, who brought them out from the land of Egypt that I might abide among them , I the Lord their God." Exod 25:22 and 29:42b-46, punning on õhel mocēd and nôcadtî, present the tent of meeting as the meetingplace of Yahweh and Israel from now on. These two passages may also echo the first call of Moses (6:2). In Moses' call, he hears Yahweh say, "I did not make myself known ( lõ &gt; nôdactî) to them by my name Yahweh" (6:3). The priestly glossator perhaps uses the wordplay of nôcadtî and J õhel mocēd with nôdactî to mark two stages in the history of communication between Yahweh and Israel: the period of Israel in 101 This formulation of the problem for Exodus 32-34 may be found in Moberly, At the Mountain of God, 62, 66, 79-80.
