<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jacques Loeb: The Man and His Tropism Theory of Animal Conduct ARNOLD E. S. GUSSIN* IN 1921 Jacques Loeb, then head of the Division of General Physiology at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, sent a copy of his 1918 book, Forced Movements, Tropisms, and Animal Conduct,1 to the late Supreme Court Justice, Louis D. Brandeis. In an accompanying letter,2 Loeb wrote: "I think one day—by some future generation [the ideas put forth in my book] —may be elaborated into a mathematical theory of human con duct."3 Loeb, as this remark implies, was not completely objective about his tropism theory. Although he vehemently denied it, in this area his science and his philosophy were intermixed. Loeb maintained4 in 1918 that one of the reasons the acceptance of his tropism theory had been delayed—it had initially been pro posed in 1890—was "because the Aristotelian viewpoint still pre vails to some extent in Biology." A question immediately comes to mind: What was this Aristotelianism that Loeb took issue with? In brief, Loeb's argument with Aristotle was the latter's insistence that everything exists to serve a given purpose. Since existence has its origin in a supreme intelligence, everything that happens has an intellectual cause and thus acquires a dogmatic arbitrariness. Natural laws are not an act of nature itself, but rather a product of divine wisdom. A thought-system such as this could easily solve, with abstract catchwords, all problems posed by natural phenomena: a stone falls because it is heavy, fire rises because it is light. Indeed, Aristotle's philosophy induced a feeling of self complacent satisfaction with the nature of the universe, and fifteen * U.S. Public Health Service Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Biology, Yale University. 1 Loeb, Jacques.

Gillispie, in a recent book,5 further explains the nature of the Aristotelian science that Loeb blamed for delaying the acceptance of his tropism theory. It ". . . started inside the mind whence concepts like purpose, soul, life, and organism were pro jected outwards to explain phenomena in the familiar terms of self-knowledge. In those terms the success of an explanation de pended only on its universality and capacity to satisfy the reason." The goal of this science, Gillispie continues, "was. to achieve a rational explanation of the world by showing how the myriad subordinate means are adapted to the larger end of order." Jacques Loeb's science, although based on experiment and mathematical expression, was similarly oriented in that it aimed at understand ing universal truths which were based on purely physico-chemical mechanisms and which were explainable by the application of pure reason. In the interpretation of data gleaned from his ex periments on animal conduct Loeb disregarded Aristotle's "pur pose," substituting for it "purely physico-chemical mechanisms." The complex reactions of animals were reduced by him to purely quantitative laws, to tropisms, and forced movements. But "nature is not like that, not an enlargement of common sense arrangements, not an extension of consciousness and human pur poses. She is more elusive, . . . more subtle, hiding her ways . . . , and only occasionally yielding glimpses of great order. . . ."6 Jacques Loeb's "glimpse of great order," the tropistic theory of animal conduct, has not stood the test of time. Although his ap proach was different, in his search for universal truths he approxi mated the ancients. There is one universal truth, put forth by Charles Darwin in 1859, that has managed to stand the test of time. The theory of evolution did impart a unity of lasting value to biology, but it was not without unfortunate side-effects. The publication of the Origin of Species, for example, led to an anthropomorphic interpretation of animal behavior; the distinction between man and other animals became less distinct, with behavior being "de scribed and explained in terms of subsequent events, results, purposes, and objectives, in teleological terms. . . ."7 As an extreme B Gillispie, Charles C.

He maintained that evolutionary hypotheses were not subject to experimental verification and pointedly ignored them in his writ ings' The dedication of one of Loeb's major works, The Organism as a Whole/ to that group of free-thinkers, including D'Alembert, Diderot, Holbach and Voltaire, who first dared to follow the consequences of a mechan istic science, incomplete as it was, to the rules of tolerance, justice and gentleness which was the hope of our civilization until it was buried under the wave of homicidal emotion that swept through the world further strengthens the view that Loeb thought the physico chemical, or mechanistic approach to be universal; the new evolu tionary theory was an encumbrance to be disregarded when study ing animal behavior. Human attributes such as "good," "evil," and "ethics" were amenable to solution,10 however, if they were considered within the framework of the tropism theory. Perhaps it is advisable before proceeding to explain what is meant by the "tropism theory." The term tropism11 has been frequently used in different senses by different authors. Originally it was reserved by the botanist de Candolle, in 1835, for the turning movement of plant stems toward the light. Loeb used the term to connote a directed movement, whether it was the curvature move ments of plants or the locomotory movements of animals. In the early decades of the twentieth century tropism came to mean not only a direct reaction but also such a reaction with the particular kind of mechanism postulated by Loeb (see below). Hence, when tropisms were mentioned, it was generally the tropism theory of animal conduct that was being referred to and not directed plant movements. Tropism had become a key-word; it was used to "explain" most of the behavioral phenomena of primitive organ isms, and advanced organisms also. Jacques Loeb's views on this tropism theory of animal conduct were succinctly outlined in a letter written to a colleague in England: "The goal [of the tropism theory]," he wrote, "is a mathematical formulation of the laws of animal conduct, or in 8 Ibid., p. 4. 9 Loeb, Jacques.

The method is also the same as that of the physicist, namely, quantitative investigation of the physico-chemical conditions underlying animal reactions."12 Loeb argued that most animals were merely bilaterally sym metrical machines, both morphologically and physiologically. Light, for example, shining more brightly on one eye than the other would cause an unequal stimulation of the optic nerves, which in turn would cause an unequal stimulation of the sym metrical body muscles. As a consequence the direction of movement of the organism was changed until the light stimulus again fell with equal intensity on the two eyes. The reaction of the animal to light was involuntary or innate; "it is an inflexible part of the organism's inherited physiological apparatus" and "is not subject to modification or control by the organism."13 What has been stated for light holds true also if light is replaced by any other form of energy. Motions caused by light or other agencies appear to the laymen as expressions of will and purpose on the part of the animal, whereas in reality the animal is forced to go where carried by its legs. For the conduct of animals consists of forced movements.14 It is fitting to use as a concrete example of the tropism theory the behavior of the larvae (caterpillars) of the butterfly, Porthesia chrysorrhoea, since these organisms were studied by Loeb in his earliest experiments. In their natural habitat, at the termination of the winter hibernation period, the larvae climb to the tips of branches where they find the opening buds which are their food. Prior to Loeb's researches it might have been thought "that the larvae found the right situation ... by a marvelous instinct,"15 or perhaps that they "smelled the food, liked the smell, and decided to eat."16 Loeb cut through this anthropomorphism with a few simple experiments designed to show that the organisms were "slaves of the light."17 When a test tube containing larvae was placed at right angles to a window, all the animals moved toward the window, where they remained permanently. If the tube was then rotated through an angle of 180 degrees, the animals moved toward the window again. The experiment could be re 12 Letter to Dr. W. B.

In fact, the larvae acted "like photochemical machines to such an extent that if food was placed behind them when they are starving they are unable to turn their heads away from the light to take nourishment."18 Loeb considered his theory to be of universal applicability, not only for biology but also for psychology and philosophy. Surely, then, his results would become even more meaningful, and even more acceptable, if they could be made quantitative. Thus, he reasoned, if heliotropisms are forced movements, caused by an inequality of muscle tensions which are related to chemical reactions occurring in the eyes, then they should be in agreement with the Bunsen-Roscoe Law which states that the total photo chemical effect (E) produced by light is proportional to the product of the intensity of illumination (i) and the time of exposure (t), or E = K • it, where K is a constant dependent upon the wave length of light. In other words, weak light acting for a long time is the equivalent of strong light acting for a short time. Loeb,19 having an uncanny knack for choosing organisms that would "fit" his hypotheses, tested the validity of the Bunsen Roscoe Law for the heliotropic movement of the hydroid Euden drium. Specimens were placed 25, 37.5, or 50 centimeters from a constant light source. Exposure times of 10, 22.5, and 40 minutes, respectively, were predicted, in accordance with the Bunsen-Roscoe Law, for the three distances. The ratios of the percentage of hydroids bending toward the light for the three distances, then, should be as 1:1:1 ; the observed ratios were as 1.02:0.9g: 1.02. Loeb concluded that the Bunsen-Roscoe Law was valid for the helio tropic response of Eudendrium. Unfortunately, however, he over reached himself in interpreting his experiment; he speculated that the experiment outlined above, and others like it, showed "that the tropism theory not only allows us to predict the nature of animal reactions but also allows us to predict them quantita tively. Thus far the tropism theory is the only one which satisfies this demand of exact science."20 18 Osterhout, op. cit. (n. 15). 19 Loeb, Jacques, and Wasteneys, Hardolph.

(n. 1), p. 93.</page><page sequence="6">326 Journal of the History of Medicine: October, 1963 It is not difficult, after reading the passages quoted above, to understand why Jacques Loeb did not want for critics. His most successful opponents were probably S. O. Mast21 and H. S. Jen nings.22 For example, the former regarded as futile the application, without qualification, of the Bunsen-Roscoe Law to the tropism theory. Mast concluded from his work on insects that the law holds in all reactions provided the time factor is sufficiently short but does not hold for any case where the time factor is sufficiently long. In other words, to paraphrase Mast,23 the orienting stimulus (light), in accord with the Bunsen-Roscoe Law, must yield a given amount of energy, that is, a threshold must be reached in the reacting organ. The orienting response is of the all-or-none type; it is not proportional in magnitude to the stimulus. Of the many criticisms Mast levelled against the tropism theory of animal conduct, the following were especially cogent: 1. Some insects in flight turn dorsad or ventrad when they orient. Since these two surfaces are not symmetrical, orientation cannot be dependent upon balanced action in the sense organs and the wing muscles. 2. If fireflies are briefly illuminated from one side, they turn through the proper angle and proceed in total darkness toward the source of illumination. The retention of orientation in these insects is, therefore, not due to continuous equal action in the receptors on opposite sides. 3. The phenomenon of orientation in asymmetrical forms requires considerable modification of the tropism theory. H. S. Jennings, probably the earliest critic of Jacques Loeb's tropism theory, stressed that orientation involved "trial-and-error." Loeb derived his main support from the movements of an animal towards a beam of light. Jennings, however, "demonstrated the occurrence of a number of reactions in Protozoa in which the direction of motion could not be related to the direction of the stimulus";24 such reactions are undirected. Loeb admitted that much protozoan behavior would not fit his theory. He objected, however, to this behavior being called "trial-and-error"; he felt this terminology was only further anthropomorphism. 21 Mast, S. O. Light and the behavior of organisms.

(n. 7), p. 43.</page><page sequence="7">gussin: Jacques Loeb and Tropism 327 It is now generally agreed that there are directed reactions in which the animal does not go straight towards or away from the source of stimulation. According to the classification of Kuhn (as modified and translated by Fraenkel and Gunn25) these may be called "telotaxic"26 or goal orientation reactions. Activity in these cases is not dependent upon balanced stimulation of two receptors. For example, a dragon fly with one eye blinded is able to locate its prey by direct flight; this reaction cannot be a tropism in Loeb's sense because it is not dependent upon balanced stimulation of both eyes. Similarly, an organism in proper tropistic balance as conceived by Loeb, when illuminated simultaneously by two lights of equal intensity, should orient towards the midpoint of a line drawn between the two lights. Yet, the mysid crustacean, Hemimysis lamornei, and the honey-bee, among other organisms, orient exclusively towards one of the two sources of stimulation, the other being continuously or temporarily disregarded. There are many more criticisms of Jacques Loeb's all-embrac ing tropism theory of animal conduct; perhaps it will be possible, without belaboring the point, to discuss one more of consider able interest. Several authors have attacked the automaticity and rigidity of Loeb's mechanistic scheme of behavior. Von Budden brock27 was particularly vehement in his criticism. He referred to Loeb as the "kind of investigator [to whom] the insignificant isolated facts are of no importance. His soaring mind desires universal recognition for the results of his achievement. The glittering theory is everything to him, the facts only its servant. If the fact does not suit, then it will be forced into . . . the theory. ..." And then, at the end of his paper, after marshalling a great deal of evidence against the tropism theory, von Budden brock maintained that it is universally true that in all tropisms the fundamental movement is adap tively constructed, for the purpose of leading the animal toward or away from the source of energy. Loeb's attempt to refer the action of the lower organisms to chemo-physical processes should therefore be disregarded. Not only is such a theory unfruitful, in von Buddenbrock's opinion, but it also leads to a shallow conception in biology "since it inclines to regard the whole problem as solved just as soon 25 Ibid., p. 317. 26 The term taxis refers to the direct locomotory orientation of a motile animal. Telotaxis is orientation in the direction of the source of stimulation which occurs without balance. 27 Buddenbrock, W. von. A criticism of the tropism theory of Jacques Loeb. /. Anim.

Although not entirely original, this was a surprisingly modern view for 1916; one would wish, however, that it had been expressed in a bit milder terms. A gentler critic was Russell (1938) who believed in the great practical value of the "causal-analytical" (= physico-chemical) method of attacking problems in the physical sciences and main tained28 that this method was also of immense value when applied to living things. Yet he could not agree with the mechanists that this was the only scientific approach to the study of living things. On the contrary, he felt that the causal-analytical approach did not "allow for the possibility that animals are more than mere machines and that neither their actions nor their perceptions can be satisfactorily analyzed in physiological terms alone." To Russell there seemed to be no need to accept a priori the mechanistic method; the direct (observational) method of analyzing animal behavior seemed just as feasible. But Jacques Loeb held tenaciously to his ideas, even in the light of overwhelming evidence against them. Fraenkel and Gunn29 perceptively wrote, "it was perhaps unfortunate that he [Loeb] formulated his theory so early in his career, for he showed both stubbornness and vigor in defending it and refused to consider sound arguments against it." Loeb constantly maintained that the acceptance of his theory was delayed because of the failure of biologists to recognize the methods of physics as applicable to biological science because they treated the problem of animal behavior from the viewpoint of the psychologist rather than that of the physicist. As early as 1912, in a letter to a colleague,30 Loeb wrote: The theory of heliotropism has been attacked repeatedly, but either by men who are not biologists, ... or who are not accustomed to thinking in physico-chemical terms, like Jennings, or Mast. ... I hope one day that I may be able to reply to these attacks, if it should be necessary. I am convinced that progress in this field of science lies in the direction of my work. As the years passed, Loeb became increasingly incensed at "the biologists who are not accustomed to thinking in physico chemical terms," especially at Mast. In 1915 Loeb wrote31 he heard from Raymond Pearl, who knew Mast personally, that 28 Russell, E. S. The behavior of animals. 2d ed.

Bancroft, 18 November 1915.</page><page sequence="9">gussin: Jacques Loeb and Tropism 329 "he is neither a gentleman nor a scholar and is possibly fit for a position of janitor but not scientist." He advised his former student Bancroft to publish a refutation of Mast's errors. "Go into it fully," Loeb wrote,32 "so you need not keep on fighting him." Again to Bancroft in 1916, this time in milder terms, "Mast is becoming a general nuisance." Another reason why Loeb felt the acceptance of the tropism theory had been delayed has already been mentioned. The Aristotelian concern for universal causes, leading to a teleological explanation of behavioral phenomena, could not be considered scientific. Only when animal reactions were reduced to quantitative laws, expressible by mathematical formulae, and when the question of purpose was dropped, could such complicated phenomena as instinctive reactions be resolved. Von Buddenbrock was dismissed by Loeb as being an Aristotelian. No doubt Russell, and perhaps even present-day students of behavior, would be dealt with in the same way. I think Jacques Loeb's crusade is best understood if one realizes that it was philosophically founded and deeply rooted in his humanistic approach to life. It was displeasing to Loeb, however, to be referred to in this light. My contributions [he wrote to W. F. Kellogg on 26 July, 1922] consist purely in physico-chemical experiments. I have never indulged in philo sophical writings . . . philosophers and biologists who were not familiar with physical chemistry, and who were therefore not able to understand my experiments attacked them because they felt my results did not agree with the old fashioned philosophical, purely speculative views on instincts and will.33 But these contentions become less convincing if one probes a bit deeper into Loeb's background. Was his outlook on the tropism theory "purely" scientific or was it colored, in reality, by a search for universal causes? Jacques Loeb was born in Germany on 7 April 1859, within a few miles of Strasbourg, in a region where French and German culture had long intermixed.34 Shortly after his eighteenth birth day he enrolled in the Askanische Gymnasium in Berlin where he obtained a classical training. Subsequently, Loeb attended four German universities—Berlin, Munich, Strasbourg, and Würzburg; at the latter two the course of his future scientific career was molded. It was indeed a favorable time for a bright and industrious 32 Letter to Dr. F. W. Bancroft, ï March 1916. 33 Letter to W. F. Kellogg, 26 July 1922. 34Flexner, Simon. Jacques Loeb and his period.

The French influence was equally pronounced in Loeb. His father, though a German citizen, had strong French sympathies and ideals; he is said to have hated Prussianism and to have "looked longingly towards the democratic institutions of France and the United States."35 Loeb was subjected to the writings of Voltaire and the French Encyclopedists while still quite young; the in fluence of this literature on his outlook can be seen in his major works. Thus, according to Robertson,36 underlying Loeb's life time of "diligence and unsparing expenditure of self" there was one central objective towards which all his endeavors were aimed, and its clue "is to be found in the literature of the Encyclopedists." The Encyclopedists held that human nature is not basically evil but on the contrary it is basically good. Thus they main tained by proper education, by attainment of freedom from religious dogma and superstition, and by the exertion of indi viduality, man could rise above his lowly state and could make the world a desirable place in which to live. "All would be well in this world," the Encyclopedists wrote, "if it were not for the faults of education and environment, created by false beliefs, mistaken prejudices, and the domination of ignorant and selfish despots."37 It has been said38 that Holbach, of all the Encyclopedists, exerted the greatest influence on Jacques Loeb, for he attempted to apply science to the solution of human problems. It follows, then, that Loeb would apply that science which seemed most useful to him — mechanistic science — to the solution of human prob lems. His aim was to strip away the mystery and ignorance, by which oppressive dogmas came to be accepted, and to show that living organisms are machines impelled by physical and mechanical forces. 1 W. J. V. Osterhout,39 Loeb's distinguished student, has written: "Faith in mechanism became the religion to which he devoted his life. ..." And again: 35 Osterhörn, op. cit. (n. 15). 36 Robertson, T. B.

No matter how great the difficulty he seemed determined, as far as possible, to reduce everything to mechanism and his courage was often justified by startling success.40 With this predisposition toward the mechanistic writings of the French philosophers, Loeb fitted into the trend current in the German universities of his youth, that is, the application of physico-chemical methods to the solution of scientific problems. After a semester each at the Universities of Berlin and Munich, Loeb entered the University of Strasbourg where he joined the laboratory of Goltz, a pupil of the great Helmholtz, who was then studying functional localization in the brain. There, Loeb's interest in brain physiology was nurtured and, after receiving his M.D. in 1884, he returned to Berlin as an assistant to Zuntz, where he continued his work on brain physiology. This interest in the brain was to serve him well in his later investigations of tropisms. In 1886 Loeb became an assistant to Fick at Würzburg, whose laboratory had made significant contributions in the field of physical physiology.41 But far more important to the young scientist was his chance association with the botanist, Julius Sachs, whose discoveries dominated the field of plant physiology between 1857 and 1890. Of interest to Loeb was Sachs's ability to control the movement of plants by light, chemicals, and gravity; Sachs called these plant movements tropisms. Loeb's alert mind saw a parallel between these phenomena and the supposed instinctive movements and behavior of animals. Here was an area where, if he could control animals as Sachs controlled plants, the problem of will could be attacked scientifically. Thus in Fick's laboratory, but under the guidance of Sachs, Loeb began his famous experi ments on the heliotropism of the caterpillar referred to above. In the fall of 1888 Loeb returned to Strasbourg to resume his work with Goltz. The new interest in animal tropisms, however, could not be forgotten; in order to pursue these studies further he spent the winter months from 1889-1890 at the Naples 40 Italics mine. 41 There seems to be some confusion about this period in Loeb's career. Flexner and Osterhout maintain that Loeb spent from 1886-1888 as an assistant to Fick at Wiirzburg, returning to Goltz' laboratory in the fall of 1888. Robertson holds that the period (1886 1888) was spent with Goltz at Wiirzburg, and that the preceding aud succeeding years were spent at the University of Strasbourg with Fick. Most authors are in agreement with Flexner and Osterhout.</page><page sequence="12">332 Journal of the History of Medicine: October, 1963 Zoological Station where invertebrate material could readily be obtained. At Naples Loeb met several American biologists. One of these, the anatomist F. P. Mall, obtained for him a position in America at Bryn Mawr College.42 Loeb remained at Bryn Mawr until, in January 1892, on an invitation from C. O. Whitman, he moved to the University of Chicago. The lure of having marine material available all the year round helped, in 1902, to entice Loeb to the University of California. By 1910 he was anxious to return East where he could have more contact with fellow scientists and would be able to spend summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory. When the call to the Rockefeller Institute came, Loeb, who considered "a research position" his "ideal,"43 accepted. He remained at this last position until his death in 1924. Loeb had an amazing capacity for productive research. The bronze tablets erected to his memory at the Marine Biological Laboratory, where he spent most of his summers, and at the Rocke feller Institute, give a partial list of his accomplishments. They read: Jacques Loeb 1859-1924 Brain Physiology Tropisms, Regeneration Antagonistic Salt Action Duration of Life Colloidal Behavior Simon Flexner,44 in a 1927 tribute to Jacques Loeb, summed up the man well by saying: "Taken in all, physical chemistry constituted for Loeb the bright silken thread on which are strung the brilliant beads of his discoveries." In fact, physical chemistry, intermixed with mechanistic philosophy, permeated every aspect of Jacques Loeb's being, in and out of the laboratory. In retro spect, it seems unfortunate that he was not more successful in compartmentalizing his contributions. It is clear that he con sidered his philosophy to be separate from his science, but given the man, the temper of the times, and the intense humanism which characterized his entire life, Loeb could hardly have been truly 42 Loeb, Leonard B.

His critics were harsh, no doubt because they could not understand the man, and also, perhaps, because they realized that strict adherence to a mechanistic conception of life would impair the progress of biology. Loeb expressed over and over again his views on social insti tutions; he believed that the results of his researches were ap plicable to the totality of human affairs and conduct. To him human existence was based on the play of blind forces and only a matter of chance. . . . Instincts [— tropistic behavior] are the root of our ethics and . . . are just as hereditary as is the form of our body. We eat, drink, and reproduce not because mankind has reached an agreement that it is desirable to do so, but because, machine-like, we are compelled to do so. . . . The mother loves and cares for her children, not because metaphysicians had the idea that it was desirable, but because the instinct of taking care of the young is inherited just as distinctly as the morphological characters of the female body. . . . Economic, social, and political conditions or ignorance and superstition may warp and inhibit the inherited instincts and thus create a civilization with a faulty or low development of ethics. . . . Not only is the mechanistic conception of life compatible with ethics: it seems the only conception of life which can lead to an understanding of the source of ethics.45 It may be difficult to believe that a man who maintained that humans were "machine-like" and that only the mechanistic con ception could lead to an understanding of ethics could have a genuine regard for suffering humanity. But Loeb's writings from 1915 up to his death contained numerous references to the sor rows of war, and what could be done to alleviate them. For example, in an article entitled "Biology and War," he wrote that if statesmen were familiar with exact science and were willing and capable of applying the results of exact science to the intellectual, moral, physical, and economic uplifting of the masses, the danger of war would be eliminated.46 In addition, a partial list of organ izations in which Loeb was active during the war years will surely remove the notion that he was not a great humanist. He was a member of the following groups: The Emergency Peace Feder ation, The American Neutral Conference Committee, The American League to Limit Armaments, The Society to Eliminate Economic Causes of War, and The American Friends of German Democracy. 45 Loeb, Jacques.

To many of these scientists he sent cash gifts, others he helped establish in positions in the United States, and for still others he organized fund-raising campaigns. Pavlov, the Russian physiologist, was a beneficiary of one of these campaigns. Loeb saw to it that the Journal of General Physiology, of which he was one of the editors, was sent free to every deserving institution which could not afford to pay the subscription. Jacques Loeb considered racial prejudice to be "oppression by a parasitic minority,"47 and wrote for The Crisis, the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In 1914, in an article "Freedom of Will and War,"48 he attempted to apply tropistic ideas to history. And finally, lest we belabor our point, Loeb attended meetings with Albert Einstein, Louis Brandeis, and others, in order to discuss the desirability of establishing a Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Typically, in a letter to Brandeis49 discussing the proposed uni versity, Loeb wrote that it would be well to begin with the develop ment of physics and chemistry, because the sciences depending upon these "fundamental sciences" (for example, biology, path ology, and medicine) would not have a chance "if there exist no thoroughly modern and well-equipped laboratories of physics and chemistry." Thus, Jacques Loeb was truly dedicated to a mechan istic philosophy, in and out of the laboratory. Indeed, looking back at Loeb the philosopher and Loeb the scientist, one can almost certainly see that it was probably impossible for him to separate the two great driving forces of his life; the subjective and the objective were so thoroughly intermeshed that they were thought of as a unity. But Loeb always insisted that all his observations were purely objective. It is clear, however, that his search for universal truths underlying animal behavior led him to unwarranted generaliza tions: all oriented movements are trop isms or combinations of them and all behavior is composed of tropisms. An attempt has been made in this essay to indicate that there are other types of oriented behavior; some of these were noted by Loeb's contem poraries (Mast and Jennings, for example), many others have been subsequently described. To Loeb's everlasting credit, how ever, is his insistence upon the removal of anthropomorphic state 47 Loeb, Jacques. Science and race. Crisis, 1914, 9, 92-93. 4S Loeb, op. cit.

Loeb could not accept the possibility that animal behavior might be more complex than he had proposed. His son, Dr. Leonard Loeb, has recently written50 that even in his father's period, "Newtonian predictability and determinism were forced to give way to an inherent indeterminancy and thus unpredictabil ity in detail, quite inconsistent with the mechanistic philosophy of the past." How seriously indeterminancy and the new quantum mechanics, as clearly expressed after Loeb's death, would have upset his mechanistic faith, with its humanistic implications, is hard to estimate. His son feels that "it is probable that he would have been content with the continued application of the physico chemical approach." Modern workers realize that the study of animal behavior is vastly more complicated than the tropism theory would permit. Tropism is just one limited aspect of the problem. In fact, the word, it may be recalled, was originally reserved for plant movements; it should never have been applied to animal, even less to human, behavior. Currently, the study of animal behavior embraces many dis ciplines. Physiology, especially neurophysiology, and endocrinology are beginning to elucidate some of the mechanisms at work in an animal in action.51 Ecologists, sociologists, and geneticists are investigating behavioral phenomena. Dominating all else, how ever, is the desire to understand how behavior evolved. Loeb, as suggested earlier in this essay, pointedly ignored evolutionary theory in his writings. He maintained that evolutionary hypotheses were not subject to experimental verification. But more important ly he probably felt "the modern world [would lose] that supreme confidence in the nature of man which the Encyclopedists avowed" on account of the evolutionary theory.52 Loeb could not believe that bad human qualities could possibly have evolved; after all, was not the mechanistic conception of life the only route to ethics? 50 Loeb, Leonard B., op. cit.

If Loeb had not stretched his hypotheses so far, and had not attempted to apply them where they obviously would not fit, his work would have been a greater contribution to studies in animal behavior and would have been regarded more highly. Contemporary workers in the field of animal behavior generally hold, with Thorpe,54 that both subjective and objective concepts are necessary in the scientific study of life, and that a biology which succeeds in being purely objective, how ever powerful it may be in parts of its field, must fail to provide a full biological philosophy—just as surely as a purely subjective biology would be unthinkable. In other words, subjective concepts derived from intro spection are among the essential tools for the study of life, and the only hope for a complete biology is to combine the subjective and objective in the right proportions, using each approach with due circumspection and adequate safeguards as is required. All our concepts in whatever field are, of course, in the last resort subjective in that they are conscious expressions of our experience; but above all, we have to beware of falling into the trap, which has so frequently ensnared past students of living matter, of supposing ourselves objective when, in fact, we are being sub jective.55 Clearly, Jacques Loeb fell into the trap. Perhaps he could not have done otherwise, and rather than be overly critical we should gratefully accept his voluminous contributions to scientific knowl edge, forgiving him his humanistic philosophy. However, I have not suggested that we forget Jacques Loeb's philosophy, with its optimistic belief in the ultimate goodness of man. With the world in its present state, it might be well if more scientists, and others who shape opinion, had equally humanistic inclinations.
