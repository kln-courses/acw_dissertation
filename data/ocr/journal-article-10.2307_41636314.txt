<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two North Mesopotamian Bronze Beakers of the Early Second Millennium B.C. By Betty L. Schlossman (New York) Two humble products of the bronzesmith's art have appeared on the market in recent years 1. They represent a style which is crude yet lively and iconographically interesting. Although they are without documented provenience, both vessels are so similar in size, design, style, and subject matter that they must emanate from the same ancient Near Eastern workshop. The problem then is to determine their origin and to suggest the nature of their cultural milieu. Lacking the scientific data which would have been made available by controlled excavation, we may rely for the present on a careful analysis of their style and iconography. Beaker No. I The first beaker (No. I), now on loan to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem from the collection of Dr. Elie Borowski, Basel, is 10.5 cm. high (figs. 1, 3-5) 2. The field is divided horizontally by a pair of repoussé bands into two registers. Another pair of bands defines the bottom of the lower register, and the rolled rim of the beaker places its upper limit in comparable relief. The Upper Register The Enthroned Figure The figure towards which the others are moving in the top register is seated on a small stool, holding a cup, facing toward the procession (figs. 1,5). This type of figure is already clearl *) This study is based on a chapter from my doctoral dissertation, Metropolitan and Provincial Styles in Mesopotamia and the Surrounding Lands in the Late Third and Early Second Millennium B. C.9 submitted to Columbia University in July, 1975. I am particularly grateful to Dr. Edith Porada for her generously given scholarly advice. Abbreviations: Amiet, Glyptique élamite : v.

Schlossman to the same period (fig. 9) б. Even the upraised hand is similar in that the vessel is set deeply into its hollow e. This feature is also seen on some Syro-Cappadocian and eighteenth- century Syrian cylinder seals 7. The garment is equivalent to a new style which emerges in the Ur III Period8. Unfortunately for dating purposes, it continues on Mesopotamian monuments through the Old Babylonian Period. The cap worn by the enthroned figure on the beaker, however, is quite distinctive and comes rather close to the more schematized version with a vertically-hatched brim seen on Provincial Babylonian seals from Assyria, which we date ca. 1815 В. C. (cf. fig. 10). The physiognomy of the enthroned figure is striking with its large frontal eye, prominent nose, and sickle-shaped cheek. The latter is sharply divided by a groove from the long, horizontally striated beard and sidelock. The type is most strongly reminiscent of the sculp- ture of the Second Early Dynastic Period, especially the head of the deity from Tell Asmar (Eshnunna) 9. Fig. 9.

This plaque is chipped around the edges and the surface is rather battered so that some details, like the headdress, are obscured or missing. Unlike the representation on Beaker No. I, this figure's feet are on a footstool. •) This is a convention seen on both of our beakers and is typical of Akkad Period renderings (cf.

This same convention is also seen on most Cappa- docian cylinders and must reflect an influence from Old Babylonian glyptic (cf. ibid., Nos. 844, 846, 848, 852, 854, Old Assyrian; Nos. 906, 907, Syro- Cappadocian). 7) Cf. ibid., Nos. 901 - 902 (Syro-Cappadocian).

The first group of worshipers approaching the enthroned figure consists of three figures all dressed in short kilts with single hatched borders (figs. 1, 5). The first worshiper approaches holding a slender beaker in his right hand. Because of the awkwardness of the drafts- manship, the cup seems to balance on the worshiper's fingertips as he offers it to the enthroned figure, or perhaps prepares to pour a libation. His other arm is held against his body. The second figure bears no gift or offering but merely clasps the hands in front of the body. Both of these figures are beardless and bald, except for two short locks which curl upward from their foreheads as on priests on Old Babylonian cylinders 10 . A Man with Hair and Beard The third man approaches the enthroned figure holding a basket or closed container (figs. 1, 5). He has short hair and beard, both marked with vertical striations. Like the other figures on these beakers he has no moustache. His hairdress is very reminiscent of that depicted on terracotta plaques in the Louvre showing artisans at work 11 . Man, Bull, and Crouching Animal Following these three worshipers, but separat- ed from them by an interval, is a man leading a bull by a rope, probably meant to be attached to a nose ring (figs. 1, 4). Above the bull, the lower half of a long-tailed figure is preserved crouching before a vertical member. Figures leading bulls appear in fresco fragments from Zimrilim's Palace at Mari 12, but do not match the arrangement seen on Beaker No. I exactly. Somewhat closer is the rendering of a man leading an animal by its horn on a relief from the Alaca Hiiyiik gate complex, which may be nearer in time to this monument than is usually thought 13 . 10) Cf.

Old Babylonian. - The photograph is published by the kind permission of the Trustees of the Pierpont Morgan Library The identity of the crouching figure above the bull's back, and its relationship to the bull and the vertical member in front of it (tree trunk or standard?) are unclear. It seems most closely related to the small crouching animals which first appear in substantial numbers as filling motifs on cylinders of the Old Babylonian Period 14 . Possibly in some cases, as on Beaker No. I, the motif shown over a bull is meant to symbolize the weather god, much as the light- ning fork does (cf. fig. 11). A cylinder of the Anatolian Group shows the characteristic placement of the creature in front of or above the leash of the weather god standing on his bull 15 (cf. fig. 17, a Provincial Babylonian seal). Huntsmen Offering Game Two of the three figures which terminate the procession of worshipers advancing toward the enthroned figure carry gifts which derive from authors date the Sphinx Gate complex to the Hittite Empire Period (cf. E. Akurgal, The Art of the Hittites (New York, 1962), p. 118). See also Machteld J.

The first figure, whose head has not been preserved, holds in its left hand a small horned or long-eared animal by a hind leg and a weapon( ?) in the right hand ie. The second huntsman holds a bird by the neck 17. The arrangement of his arms repeats that seen in the man who leads the bull dis- cussed above. The third man holds his left arm across his body while the right is raised in the air. Since the beaker has been repaired at this point, his gesture remains unclear. These three figures and their attributes call to mind most strikingly the representations of the hunting god on the Anatolian Group of Cappadocian sealings. Although the attributes of the three huntsmen or hunting gods on the beaker are nondescript and the animal of the first huntsman cannot be precisely identified, the fact that one figure holds a bird by the neck like the hunting god in a seal impression from Kültepe 18, and the other an animal which could be a rabbit or a gazelle, seems to indicate a relation between our «huntsmen» and the hunting god of the sealings of the Colony Period and of the later Hittite Empire. The Lower Register Two Goats Flanking a Tree The motifs in the lower register of Beaker No. I seem by nature more disparate than le) This distinctive mode of holding the animal, prey is seen on Syro -Cappadocian (Porada, Corpus Nos. 900, 906) and Syrian seals (ibid., Nos. 910, 927, 936). The appearance of this specifically Syrian feature suggests a certain dependence on Syrian iconography. Cf. also Opificius, Terrakotta- relief , Tf. 1, No. 27, for a Mesopotamian example. The figure on the beaker may have had a bull's head since Western Asiatic bull-headed demons (perhaps hunting-demons) often wear kilts and hold upended animals. (Cf. Б. Williams Forte, Ancient Near Eastern Seals : A Selection of Stamp and Cylinder Seals in the Collection of Mrs . William H. Moore (New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, forthcoming), No. 25 (L55.49.47), discussion and footnote references (Syrian) ; and Porada, Seals from Cyprus , 262 and pl.

Though all move toward the right, no common theme seems to unite them. Below the enthroned figure and the first group of approaching worshipers, appears a rather simplified ver- sion of the ancient theme of two goats flanking a sacred tree (figs. 1, 5). Both goats stand up- right on their hindlegs, one foreleg resting on top of a small fiat-topped hill, crudely decorated with a scale pattern. The most interesting comparison is with a scene on a cake mold from Mari showing two goats rampant on either side of a «sacred tree» and hill (fig. 12) 19. Though the style is more elegant and the tree and goats more detailed than on the beaker, the hill beneath the trees has a similarly flattened top. Quite unusual in our beaker's rendering is the addition of a lion attacking one of the rampant goats. The lion, small and doglike in appearance, attacks the goat from the back in a rather naturalistic manner. One forepaw 1#) I owe this comparison to Dr. Edith Porada.</page><page sequence="7">Two North Mesopotamian Bronze Beakers of the Early Second Millennium B.C. 149 grasps the goat's belly and a hindleg grips one of the goaťs hindlegs near the hoof, as though to help steady the prey while the lion bites its neck. The lion's head is carefully turned into a frontal position, meeting the neck at a ninety degree angle for this purpose. Thus although the predator is small and unfero- cious, it is convincingly intent upon its purpose. This appears to be a provincial artist's use of a highly effective naturalistic device that seems to have had some currency in the early second millennium B. C. (cf. fig. 13, a terra- cotta mold from Mari) 20. Fig. 13. Terracotta mold, from Mari. Musée du Louvre, AO 18902. Earlier publication: Parrot, Mari II.

He holds it at arm's length with his left hand while he prepares to dispatch it with the weapon he holds in his right hand, wielding it above his head 21 . Figures attacking lions 20) Cf. also Barrelet, Figurines , No. 847 (terra- cotta plaque). 21 ) Perhaps we are meant to read this scene from right to left, and the lion which first attacks one abound in the comparative material, but none of them is shown carrying out the action in exactly the same way 22 . The weapon which the lion-killer wields is a fenestrated ax, more often associated with scenes of battle than with the hunt 23 . Com- parable weapons appear all over the ancient Near Eastern world in the early second millen- nium B. C. 24. The bulk of the Near Eastern axes date to the Old Babylonian Period. By the eighteenth century the fenestrated ax, and its related form, the duck-bill ax, had given way to narrow, long-bladed, socketed axes which could pierce and penetrate armor 25. This development provides a useful terminus ante quern for the representations on the two beakers 26 . of the goats is then dispatched by a heroic figure Such a representation would be, reminiscent of the protector of flocks on Early Dynastic and Akkad Period seals. 22) N.

XXIII, 68 (figure hunting lion with spear, Anatolian Group). M) I his may serve to emphasize the allegorical nature of the motif as it is shown here. 24 ) These axes derive from Mesopotamian flat epsilon axes of the third millennium B. C. (cf. Woolley, Ur Excavations II (London 1934), p. 306, pl. 224, U. 9687 (grave PG/691), (Akkad Period). Although the ax on the beaker is not detailed, it seems to be rather close in form to a fenestrated, socketed ax head with open shaft-hole in the Ashmolean Museum, probably from Gilan, cf. Moorey, Catalogue , pp. 57 - 58, No. 24; p. 56, fig. 8 (No. 24); pl. 3, No. 24. 25) Yadin, Warfare , I, p. 60. Calmeyer, Bronzen, pp. 48-50, Gruppe 24. 2e) It is interesting to note that in the Syro- Palestinian area the fenestrated «eye» ax is found in the M. B. I Period (c. 2000-1900/1850), while the duck-bill ax is characteristic of the M. B. IIA Period (c. 1900/1850-1750 B. C.), with only a short period of possible overlapping, v. E. D. Oren, ZDPV 87 (1971), 109-39. If the region which produced our beaker was influenced by the Syro- Palestinian ax development, then the represen- tation would coincide with the early years of the M. B. IIA Period when some fenestrated «eye» axes were still made. The tin-bronze material of Beaker No. II (see n. 36) (and presumably No. I also), which is typical of the duck-bill axes of M. B. IIA and which distinguishes them from the copper weapons of M. B. I, may also prove to be a dating criterion, cf. W. G. Dever, BASOR 217 (1975), p. 30.</page><page sequence="8">150 Batty L. Schlossman The Man on the Ass To the left of the lion-killer is a man riding on an ass, moving toward the right (figs. 1, 4). He sits erect and rather far back on his mount, holding a stick in his right hand, resting it against the animal's rump, and a rope in his left hand, which passes around the animal's neck. A tassel hangs from this rope at the base of the animal's neck. A vertical line on the ass's back, in front of the rider's thigh, may indicate a girth or perhaps a covering on the animal's back. Although the details on this rendering, like others from the late third and early second millennium B. C., remain somewhat equivocal, it seems that the animal represented is an ass, and not a horse or an onager 27. On Mesopotamian plaques of the late third and early second millennium B. C., the har- nessing of the animal's head, where it has been preserved, is always based on the same prin- ciple. The reins, held in the rider's left hand, have been fastened to a ring in the animal's nose 28 . On our beaker this device has been eliminated in favor of a simple cord passing around the animal's neck, which the rider grasps in his left hand. A simplified method of harnessing, or none at all, may have been conventional for ass-riding. On the Byblos scabbard sheath the rider grasps the donkey's short mane and no harness is shown 29 . A Middle Kingdom representation from Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai, dating to the reign of Amenemhat III (1842-1797 B. C.), shows an Asiatic chief riding on a donkey which is harnessed with a nose ring 30. Three Female Figures Following the man on the ass, and also pro- ceeding toward the right are three female figures (figs. 1,3). The first two are shown in profile with arms raised in prayer. The third is shown in the composite view characteristic of many of the figures on this vessel, with lower body and head in profile, and thorax and arms in frontal position. This figure seems to have held in its left hand an object of which only a fragment is preserved. It was perhaps a pail or some other container 31 . Despite their different attitudes, all three figures are dressed in the same way. Their garments are flounced and fringed( ?) from the waist down and are tight-fitting above with long sleeves and possibly bracelets. All three have their hair arranged in a kind of chignon, supported by a band which encircles the head. The iconography of these ladies is difficult to interpret, but the fact that there are three of them and that they are small in scale and are placed so high in the field that they fill only three-quarters of the register with a large empty space under their feet, seems signi- ficant. They may be associated with celestial figures and this representation may derive from a little understood Akkadian tradition where three nude females appear over the back of a monster (fig. 14) 32. An Akkad Period seal with similar iconography was found at Susa 33. Because a few other Susa seals, both earlier and later, have related elements, Amiet suggests that the theme may be specifically Susian 34. 27) Cf. P. R. S. Moorey, Horse-Riding in Iraq , 36-50. Though Moorey believes that all the equids on the plaques that cannot be identified as horses, are onagers (ibid., p. 38), some may be asses, cf. D. E. McCown and R. C. Haines, OIP 78 (1967) pl. 137, 8. Moorey concludes that the plaques with equid riders represent genre scenes (Horse-Riding in Iraq , p. 45). Although in isolation they seem so, the association of the motif with others on our beaker, and also on the Byblos dagger sheath (see n. 29), opens up the possibility of other iconographie significance. 28) Ibid., p. 41. 29) Conveniently illustrated in W.

The connection between these early renderings and the three ladies on the two beakers, was brought to the writer's attention by Dr. E. Porada. She concurs with the idea that it is conceivable that the three ladies above the monster were an Iranian concept. However, she points out that this remains to be proved since we cannot as yet differentiate between seals of the Akkad Period made in Mesopotamia and those made in Iran. It is certainly significant in this respect that three nude figures appear once again on a seal impression of Winnerke from Nuzi (15th century B. C.), the seal having been made in Iran, v.</page><page sequence="9">Two North Mesopotamia!! Bronze Beakers of the Early Second Millennium B.C. 151 Fig. 14. Cylinder, Pierpont Morgan Library, No. 234.

The Upper Register The Enthroned Figure Like the enthroned figure on Beaker No. I (figs. 1, 5), the personage towards whom the others are proceeding in the top register is seated on a small stool facing them, holding a cup (figs. 2, 6, 8) 39. His long garment has rows of small squares incised on it and his cap, with horizontally divided brim, has vertical striations on its crown. Caps with vertical ridges are worn by worshipers and enthroned figures on Isin- Larsa, Old Babylonian, and Cappadocian seals. It is quite clear that the cap, indeed the entire costume of this figure, carefully distinguish it from its counterpart on Beaker No. I. Since the flounced and fringed garment has been universally accepted among scholars as a distinction of divinity, it would be tempting then to say that while this figure is divine, the other on Beaker No. I must be mortal. The physiognomy of this enthroned figure with its large, projecting nose and large, thickly lidded, frontal eye, is reminiscent of that of Beaker No. I. But the general impression here is much less evocative of the conventions of the Second Early Dynastic Period than of the faces on the Anatolian Group of Kültepe seals. This probably results from the emphatic straight 37 ) Oral communication from Teheran and New York antiquities dealers. 38) Unlike Beaker No. I, the bottom of this vessel is preserved (cf. fig. 6). Although there is no unrestored join between this base and the walls of the vessel, it appears to be ancient. 39) The gesture for holding the cup is analagous to that of the enthroned figure on Beaker No. I. The cup is strongly reminiscent of a small bronze vessel in The Metropolitan Museum of Art found in Luristan and inscribed in Akkadian to Sharkali- Sharri (Accession No. 48.178.2). H. 5.2 cm.

This facial type is repeated on the other figures of this beaker. The Figure Behind the Throne, A Fan Bearer( ?) Behind the enthroned figure stands a man in a short kilt, which has a wide belt and a single hatched border at the bottom (figs. 2, 6). Like many of the other figures on the beaker, he has vertically striated hair and a short beard. He faces toward the left, like the seated figure in front of him, holding his bent left arm across his body and the right arm upraised with a fan41. Similarly attired attendants are seen on a few Old -Babylonian seals which show enthron- ed figures receiving worshipers (cf. fig. 16). Fig. 16. Cylinder, Pierpont Morgan Library, No. 325.

Bronze Beakers of the Early Second Millennium B.C. 153 Figures of the Procession A Worshiper Bringing a Goat and Bull. The first figure to approach the seated god (figs. 2, 8) holds a small horned animal under the left arm and with the right hand leads a bull by a cord attached to a nose ring, much like the bull tender on Beaker No. I (cf. figs. 2, 4). Figures carrying animal offerings in their arms are seen on seals of the Akkad, Post Akkad, and Old Babylonian Periods, though they apparently disappear from the glyptic of the Third Dynasty of Ur and Isin-Larsa Periods 42. They appear sometimes on Cappadocian cylinders (cf. fig. 10) and are represented on contemporary clay plaques, figurines, and statuettes 43. The figure on the beaker wears a short kilt, and the short hair and beard have vertical striations. The face and the front part of the body are not completely clear since their ori- ginal appearance has been somewhat altered by corrosion and restoration. To this writer's knowledge, this is the only example where the theme of kid-bearing worshiper and bull tender have been combined, though the idea of joining two separate themes has already been seen in the attacking lion - goat and sacred tree motif of Beaker No. I. A Hunting God( ?) A second man follows closely behind the bull (figs. 2, 7, 8). He wears a short kilt with a single hatched border along its lower edge and another diagonally across its front. His short beard and hair have vertical striations, and he has a bow slung over his right shoulder, holding the grip in his right hand. His upraised left hand touches the hindquarters of a goat, which seems to stand on the bull's back, and has a bird of prey standing on its back. In front of the goat's face, occupying the space between its horns and the first worshiper's head, is a small quad- ruped with large ears and a short, upturned tail. All three animals must be in or on the hunter's 42) Porada, Corpus, Nos. 245 (Akkad) ; No. 254 (Post Akkad); No. 346 (Old Babylonian).

The bow, the bird of prey (eagle ?), the small quadruped, and the gesture are so similar to those known on Anatolian seals from Kültepe and also from Hittite texts 45, that it seems fairly safe to conclude that we have a related rendering. Our figure shares the bird of prey and small quadruped with Colony Period representations and the bow and eagle of a Hittite description46. The goat is an addition so far unique to this example. Since there is so much variety in the contemporary render- ings from Kültepe, it would seem that in this example we have but another variant of the same general type, in some ways more explicit than the smaller scale versions on the seals. Perhaps the attributes here pertain to a local version of the deity in Assyria or Iran. The type of bow held by the hunting god on Beaker No. II is only rarely seen on contem- porary representations. It is therefore an important document for the development of 44 ) In a communication to the writer, Dr. E. Porada has suggested that the hunting god has his hand in a position somewhat resembling those of the hunting gods in the Cappadocian imprints, i. е., the bird of prey could be thought of as being perched on his hand with the goat either the victim to be or already meant as the victim of the hunting eagle.

It is of the double-convex type, appearing to be almost triangular in this representation 47 . It may have been as a sign of special dignity that this particular kind of composite bow was assigned as an attribute to the hunting god on Beaker No. II. The Weather God Following the hunting god and his animal and human entourage is another group of anthropomorphic and animal figures which present a unique configuration of the weather god, Adad, and his attributes (figs. 2, 6, 7). The god has a long beard and he wears a head- dress and a short kilt with a thick waistband. Two lines on his left wrist suggest that his upper garment has long sleeves. He strides on the back of a bull and his right arm is raised over his head, holding a weapon(?) of which only the end is preserved. This part of the bea- ker's surface, including a portion of the deity's face, has been restored. In his left hand the god holds two reins, one leading to the bull's nose, the other leading to the nose of a lion-griffin which precedes the bull. The lion-griffin has gaping jaws from which protrudes a lolling tongue (or perhaps fiery breath?). His forelegs, hindlegs, and under- belly are covered with a hatched pattern, doubtlessly standing for feathers, as are his upright tail, his crest, and the pair of wings rising from the shoulder area. All four paws seem to have bird's talons. The thick, hatched rein, which extends above his body from the weather god's hand to the monster's nose, creates a kind of groundline on which a second, smaller lion-griffin is standing. This creature has essentially the same characteristics as its larger counterpart, although it is partially restored. A small horizontal line, preserved above the smaller beast's shoulder, suggests that a third rein may have extended from that point to the god's raised right hand. Just in front of the smaller lion-griffin, standing on the rein above the head of the larger monster, is a curious creature of anthro- pomorphic form. The body appears to be nude, and in place of arms there are two outspread 47) Yadin, Warfare , I, p. 8. wings, each divided once down its length and decorated with a chevron pattern of incised lines. The figure is bearded, and long flowing hair with horizontal striations extends out behind the head. The weather god on Beaker No. II has features that are related in some ways to both Akkadian and Old Babylonian renderings, but follows neither iconography in toto. In fact this rendering seems to be transitional between the types represented in the two periods. The god Fig. 17. Cylinder, Pierpont Morgan Library, No. 893.

The way in which one animal is placed above the other's back is reminiscent of a Pierpont Morgan Library seal of the Provincial Babylonian Group where four bulls pulling a chariot are depicted one above the other, in descending scale (fig. 17), and also of an unprovenanced terracotta relief plaque 48. In type the lion-griffins are related to the Akkadian III Period examples with short legs, 48) Opificius, Terrakottarelief , p. 90, No. 289; Tf. 6, No. 289 (drawing of terracotta plaque).</page><page sequence="13">Two North Mesopotamian Bronze Beakers of the Early Second Millennium B.C. 155 Fig. 18.

In a seal impression at Yale (NBC 5613), dated to Amar-Sin of Ur, year 6 (2041 B. C.), the weather god stands on a lion-griffin. He is preceded by an armed deity and a goddess reaching upwards, both with wind-blown hair. Buchanan suggests that the seal may reflect North Mesopotamian iconography 50. Another seal, found at Susa, shows a beautifully carved presentation scene, next to which the name Shu-Sin (2036-2028 B.C.) is still legible 51. According to Amiet, the weather god on a lion- griffin next to the presentation scene was cut secondarily.

The tenacity of this tradition of the weather god astride a lion- griffin, in regions outside Babylonia is illus- trated by other seals too 53. The idea of showing lion-griffin and bull in a procession with Adad probably derives from such Akkadian seals where the hero killing the bull precedes Adad on his mount 54, putting the animals together, but in reverse order to the depiction on Beaker No. II. On the latter, Adad now rides on the attribute which was vanquished on the earlier seals, suggesting a relationship between rider and mount which must be at the core of all similar iconography. The small figure with outspread wings and wind-blown hair is clearly related to the seal of Amar-Sin mentioned above and particularly to the companions of the snake goddess which appear on a nineteenth-century seal and seal impression from Northern Mesopotamia (figs. 18, 19). It also relates to figures with wind- blown hair on an eighteenth-century northwest Iranian cup (fig. 21) 56. These associations help 52) See also H. H. von der Osten, OIP 22 (1934), pl.

Bronze Beakers of the Early Second Millennium B.C. 157 to localize the popularity of this iconography of wind deities and thus to point to the probable source of production for our two bronze beakers. The close relationship of Beaker No. II's rendering of the weather god to versions dating to the Akkad, Third Dynasty of Ur, and Old Babylonian Periods, implies that it is transi- tional in character, both iconographically and chronologically. It would fit most comfortably into the Assyrian Colony Period. The unique features of the iconography suggest that it was made outside the peripheral areas previously identified with the Cappadocian glyptic where ancient Akkadian traditions might still have lived on more strongly than elsewhere, i. е., northeastern Mesopotamia and northwestern Iran. The Lower Register A Lion Attacking a Human Victim In the lower register, below the first group approaching the enthroned deity, a nude( ?) man on one knee is attacked by a lion, while another man, standing behind him, touches the first man's head (figs. 2, 7, 8). Whether this gesture is meant to be protective or hostile is as ambiguous here as it is on contemporary seals (cf. figs. 10, 20). The kneeling man raises his right arm to ward off the lion and extends the left downwards behind him as if to brace himself. The lion, of the same playful-looking breed as on Beaker No. I, is shown here in the field above the head of the kneeling man. The meaning of this scene is apparently closely associated with that of the lion (lion- griffin or lion-demon) attacking a goat, usually seated on a knoll 6e. This parallelism in meaning 9.2 cm. Though most of this cup's elements can be matched in a general way by representations of the second millennium В. C., the uniqueness of so many of the details makes a secure dating difficult. A late second millennium date has been suggested by P. Amiet, Syria , 45 (1968), 253-56, pl. XVIII and fig. 3, to complement the efflorescence of the Marlik material (cf. also Buchanan, Iraq 33, p. 10, n. 46). On the basis of related iconography and the rounded treatment and careful delinea- tion of detail, particularly of the facial features, we would like to suggest an early second millen- nium dating. (For a more detailed discussion of the writer's view, see Schlossman, dissertation (above n. 1), Ch. VII, pp. 238-44). 66 ) Cf. Porada, Corpus , p. 44. Although the lion is suggested not only by the similarity of the motif, but also by the common occurrence of both motifs, as pendants, on Old Babylonian and Provincial Babylonian seals 57. The theme also appears isolated and in varying forms on a number of terracotta relief plaques of the Old Babylonian Period 58 . On the beaker the weather god may be thematically connected with this scene since he appears between two pairs of such contestants on an Old Babylonian cylin- der 59. Warriors and Prisoners To the left of the man on one knee is another group with four male figures, two prisoners alternating with two armed deities(?) (figs. 2, 6, 7). The prisoners are nude and seem to have their hands bound in front of their bodies. (Portions of all of these figures have been restored so that their exact Configuration re- mains unclear). Both have short hair and beards with vertical striations. Between the two prisoners stands a deity, facing left, wearing a short kilt and a tall conical headdress with horizontal striations, probably representing pairs of horns. Similar divine headgear is seen on Colony Period lead figurines and molds eo. Like a number of deities in this period, this figure holds a mace. Although the resemblance is not strong, he could be a local variant of the Mesopotamian «god with the mace», whom Edith Porada suggests may be a divinity or the king in warrior garb 61 . attacking a man on one knee seems to be related to the powerful forces of Nergal, the imagery must have grown out of the innumerable contests between heroic figures and lions of the Early Dynastic and Akkad Periods. On an Ur III seal (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals , pl. XXV, f) a lion attacks a hero on one knee, who no longer relies merely on his physical powers, as in the earlier periods, but uses an ax to defeat the lion (ibid., p. 144). The complete transformation of the out- come of this contest is visible in the Old Baby- lonian Period renderings of the theme discussed. 67) Cf. e. g.

Three Goddesses. As on Beaker No. I the scenes of the lower register include a procession of three female figures (figs. 2, 6, 8). Unlike the Beaker No. I examples (figs. 1, 3), however, these are full- scale figures which are shown in an attitude of supplication. The first figure is partially restored and seems closer to the Beaker No. I type in headdress and clothing. The other two have horned headdresses which make their divine status certain. The same comparisons which we suggested for the three figures on Beaker No. I would seem to apply here too.</page><page sequence="17">Two North Mesopotamian Bronze Beakers of the Early Second Millennium B.C. 159 Iconography and Style The scenes of the upper registers of both cups also appear to be closely related. On both there is an enthroned figure holding a cup, receiving groups of worshipers. Judging from its costume, the figure on Beaker No. II seems to be divine in character like most of the figures approaching it. The disc and crescent near its head probably confirm this. The character of the enthroned figure on Beaker No. I is much more ambiguous, but the lack of distinctively divine characteristics suggests that it is royal. The worshipers approaching this figure also seem to be essentially mortal and are possibly even cult officiants, especially the first three. These figures are comparable to the first one holding a horned animal and leading a bull on Beaker No. II. The figure who leads a bull with a crouching figure above its back on Beaker No. I has already been associated with the weather god who appears in full regalia on Beaker No. II. The last group of figures on Beaker No. I holding both a bird and a quadruped by the hind leg, have been connected with the iconography of the hunting god. This god is shown in his divine guise on Beaker No. II. Thus it appears that the iconographie motifs on both cups are closely interconnected. In both cases a procession of «worshipers» of similar character performs acts of piety or brings gifts to a figure which sits facing them in dignified immobility holding a cup. Both registers should probably be thought of then as part of the same continuous procession. The precise meaning of these scenes is difficult to decipher in lieu of explanatory contem- porary texts. In one case, on Beaker No. I, the participants seem to be mortal and royal, in the other, on Beaker No. II, divine, perhaps representing the apotheosis of the king. At any rate mortal acts seem to have their divine counterparts. Ultimately the scenes suggest an origin in ritual, per- haps one like that represented here where the participants presented tribute and religiously signi- ficant acts to a ruler, a rite which was aggrandized by a divine counterpart being celebrated on a cosmic plane. These very beakers may have been used in some such ceremony. The idea of dividing a pictorial field into two (or more) registers is fairly common in ancient Near Eastern iconography. Whenever simultaneous actions were to be shown, or simply those which extended further than the length of the field allowed, often a system of registers was devised to show the actions superimposed in vertical layers. The lines dividing the registers then would become the groundline for each row of figures. The double divisions on these two beakers, though distinctive, are comfortably within the Mesopotamian traditions of the late third and early second millennium B. C. Cappadocian sealings can also show this approach to designing the field, though not necessarily with register lines (cf. fig. 10). At first glance the representations on these beakers appear to be rather crude and the figures seem to be stocky in their proportions, especially those on Beaker No. II. This effect is no doubt exaggerated by the inept restoration and the poor state of preservation of some parts of the surface especially where obscured by repairs. The figures on Beaker No. I, however, are rather more care- fully executed, and their slender, long-legged proportions remind us as much of the mature Old Babylonian style, as do their lack of necks, and proportionally large heads give them the same generally stocky appearance as the figures on Beaker No. II. The large heads, equalling about one-quarter of the body height, must be a local provincial characteristic, just like the sharp angles at which the parts of the body are arranged, the tendency to flatten the bodies in terms of their broadest mass across the two dimensional plane, and to spread gestures out horizontally and vertically so as not to obscure more than necessary any body part. On the same principle, figures which are thought of as existing side by side are placed one above the other, like the two lion-griffins preceding the weather god on Beaker No. II. Some of the facial types are strongly reminiscent of the stylizations in the Anatolian Group of Cappadocian designs (Beaker No. II) while others, like the enthroned king on Beaker No. I and his first three worshipers, hark back to the Second and Third Early Dynastic Periods. Even the iconography seems to be based on a mixture of contemporary prototypes and confused versions of retardataire models (e. g., hunting god and weather god on Beaker No. II). It is true of course that processions towards an enthroned figure are common in all of the provincial styles of the Colony Period, but the combination of elements points strongly in one direction.</page><page sequence="18">160 Betty L. Schlossman, Two North Mesopotamian Bronze Beakers The spirit of these scenes seems to come closest to what we see in Old Assyrian art as repre- sented in Karum Level II at Kültepe-Kanesh вз. Neither the plasticity nor the dynamism that mark comparable Syrian 64 and Anatolian 65 local styles is visible. The continuity of the directional axis in each register seems contrary to the tendency toward breaking up the field into separate units that we see in Old Elamite designs 66 . Even where Iranian art shows a close relationship with Old Assyrian models e7, the product is more provincial looking than the style of the two beakers. The general dependence on provincial prototypes typical of the Karum Level II Period at Kültepe-Kanesh and the appearance of such striking motifs as the frontal-headed lion on Beaker No. I, suggest that these beakers were made around the middle of the 19th century В. C. They are the products of a workshop that was familiar with the iconography of the Provincial Babylonian and Anatolian Cappadocian styles, and was at the same time influenced by more independent Iranian, Syrian, and Anatolian iconography, some still clinging to late third millennium traditions. The weather god with both bull and lion-griffins and especially his winged companion with wind-blown hair, suggest a northeast Mesopotamian provenience, in the heartland of Hurrian culture and iconography. Since one of these beakers is said to be from Iran (Luristan), and since there is a well-established and long lived bronze- working tradition there, it may well be that these beakers come from the border area, from a site on an old trade route where products from the inter- national market would have been drawn upon for the charmingly awkward amalgam of this local style. ®3) Cf.
