<plain_text><page sequence="1">described it, this installation was a personal homage to Mendieta, a ritual that brought her works to Africa, a continent that was of myth- ical importance for her. In his display, Mos- quera seemed to honor her presence by arranging four of the smaller photographs into yet another silhouette, reminiscent of the sacrificial connotations of a crucifix, thereby memorably stamping Mendieta's image on a South African landscape. Mosquera selected photographs in Men- dieta's Silueta series from countries funda- mental to her statement, Mexico and Cuba. Although her images at the water's edge or within fallen ruins provided accessible readings of identity divided and transformed by exterior forces, their impact was somewhat diminished because their locations, which are crucial to their statement, were unrecorded; indeed, most of the works were not labeled at all. A further problematic absence was the English translation of Bouabre's French text that Mosquera told us he had intended to pro- vide. Without such translations, Bouabr6's books and drawings (both heavily text depen- dent) remained inaccessible. The installation itself was unsettling and evinced Mosquera's modernist approach. The artist's 100 tiny post- card-size drawings were not displayed in the more customary cumulative mosaic, as illus- trated in the catalogue itself, but strung out as a diminutive line of images trickling along the walls of large rooms, empty except for two stands for his books. Although it could be questioned whether the works succeeded in sustaining the demands of the space, the strategy was intended to emphasize what Mosquera spoke of as Bouabre's mystical experience expressed in his arcane alphabet, yet also the affinity of his work with conceptu- al art. Mosquera said he aimed to contest the way in which the reputed "Africanness" of Bouabre confined him to "Bantustans" created by the international art market, itself a "sys- tem of apartheid." Ironically Mosquera thus revealed his own position in relation to that market, as he attempted to validate Bouabre's work by revealing its importance within the discourses of internationalism, which val- orizes conceptual art. In his use of terms like "Bantustan" and "apartheid," Mosquera was no doubt intend- ing to mark his conceptualization of "Im- portant and Exportant" as an exhibition that crossed boundaries and suggested shared con- cerns between Africa and the global art scene. While fully supportive of Mosquera's ambition to offer new avenues by which importance might be generated, we must object to his use of such terminology within a discussion of the international art market. These words, which appear in the catalogue and locally published interviews, have fresh and deep resonances with a very particular history. Artists marginal- ized by the international art market hardly suf- fer in ways comparable to South Africans who were forcibly relocated to homelands, called "Bantustans." The word "apartheid," which presupposes essential difference among peo- ple, recalls intolerably racist social and legal systems, the effects of which are unacceptably 78 diminished when the word is appropriated to describe something like the art market. In a postmodernist context, curators play a more proactive role than was customary in the past. The selection of works out of knowl- edge and sensibility remains paramount, as does the choice of a unifying theme to give coherence to the whole, be it historical, geo- graphical, technical, or content-related. But the curator may also choose to use works to create new meanings through their juxtaposi- tion and recontextualization in the gallery space. In this way the curator becomes artist, creating an "installation," a comprehensive work that subsumes individual pieces. In discussing his intentions with us, Mosquera seemed readily to embrace this cre- ative role. He selected and commissioned works to fit the chosen focus of the exhibition, he co-opted the gallery spaces as thematic zones to create his metaphor of land and sea, and, in the arrangement of the works, he aimed to effect change in perceptions of particular artists such as Bouabr6 and Mendieta. There were some problems, however, in identifying these interventions and their purpose, as well as the overall organizational theme. It was unfortunate that the omission of more direction for the viewer obscured Mosquera's admirable overriding objective-to question the processes by which importance is created in the interna- tional art market and to introduce diasporic identity into its circuits, opening them to new histories and new geographies.

ISN'T S/HE A DOLL? Play and Ritual in African Sculpture UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History Los Angeles, California November 17, 1996-November 16, 1997 Reviewed by Rosalinde G. Wilcox During my stay in Cameroon in 1988-89, I photographed a canoe race. One of the teams had decorated the prow of its canoe with a Western baby doll of the "Betsy Wetsy" vari- ety. With its chubby arms and legs and round- ed torso, it looked much like Beatrice, the beloved doll of my childhood, except that on the occasion of the race, it was ornamented with coins and wore raffia palm rather than a rattle and diaper. Beatrice and I had spent many hours together in magical play. The Cameroon baby doll was also involved in play-perhaps magical, certainly ritual, for she represented, even embodied, the water spirit jengu.

For the duration of the race at least, the jengu baby doll was sacred, and while attached to the prow she could not be touched. The event was not casual child's play, but play it was-warlike, competitive, serious, and fun. Since that time, I have reflected on the powerful cultural associations inherent in both my Beatrice and the jengu baby dolls. Precisely in that vein, Elisabeth Cameron, curator of "Isn't S/He a Doll? Play and Ritual in African Sculpture," invited viewers, both adults and children, to contemplate dolls as alrican arts * summer 1998</page><page sequence="2">Opposite page: DENIS J. NERVIG, COURTESY OF THE UCLA FOWLER MUSEUM OF CULTURAL HISTORY potent objects that transcend Western con- cepts of the doll as merely a child's (read girl's) plaything. At the entrance to the exhib- it, visitors were confronted with four photo- graphic images-of a doll from the Namchi, the Asante, and the Yoruba, and of one Western plastic doll; these were reproduced much larger than life-size, dwarfing the life- size image of a little girl holding her doll. Thus, viewers were put on immediate notice that they were expected to toy, if not play, with Cameron's premise of dolls as encoders of social identity and cultural patterns. On display were over 200 figures (or dolls?) gathered from twenty-four African summer 1998 ? atrlcan arts countries. They ranged from the figurally and functionally identifiable, such as the Asante akua'ba, Yoruba ere ibeji, Baule bolo bia and blolo bian, and Western-import molded plastic dolls in vibrant colors (now also produced locally in many African countries), to the less familiar and more abstract. For example, a mwali (girl or initiate) doll among the Yao peo- ples of Zimbabwe derives its shape from the natural configuration of a gourd that resem- bles a dumbbell with a bulging middle. Since both ends are the same, an application of beads to one end designates the head. The sculptures were organized around three basic themes: Isn't S/He a Doll?, Dolls Top: Akua'ba. Asante, Ghana.

Most of the vitrines contained two sets of text panels, one for children and the other for adults, each sit- uated at the appropriate eye level. Field pho- tographs located over the displayed figures throughout the exhibition were exceptionally telling: they documented the object and con- text, specifically the relationship between the doll and its owner or caretaker. The first section clarified and contextual- ized the exhibition with an overview of fig- ures, materials, technologies, and functions. Visitors were guided visually and textually through various ideas, for instance, that these miniature human images appear in various levels of play where they are manipulated into action by adults as well as children. Figures exhibited in this section were pro- duced by peoples from all regions of sub- Saharan Africa, demonstrating both the scope of the exhibition and the strength of doll tra- ditions. They included Shona hollow basketry figures, Turkana dolls ornamented with seeds and glass beads, and an Abuan dinner-bell doll. The manufacturers varied from black- smiths, as among the Mossi, to young Kuba boys or apprentice carvers, and often the chil- dren themselves. While young visitors fol- lowed their own special exhibition guide through the first display, adults were engaged by a photograph taken by Marilyn Houlberg of Olu Funke Iya-Irisa, an important priestess in Ikenne, Nigeria, holding figures that repre- sent her deceased twins (ere ibeji). Thus, Cameron's challenge: Is ere ibeji a doll? A few well-chosen Western dolls provided a comparison with African dolls and revealed the distinctions made in the United States between dolls and so-called action figures. While Ken and Barbie are considered dolls because they are categorized as girls' playthings, the charac- ter Freight from the G.I. Joe series is called an action figure because of its appeal to boys. But in fact, most of the dolls in the exhibition were destined to be manipulated by girls and women. One exception was an outstanding Kuba figure used by both girls and boys. This elegantly abstract doll was carved from a single piece of wood, its anthropomorphism evident only by its uniquely Kuba hairstyle. Although neither the Kuba doll nor its owner is gender specific, I would ask: What are the differences, if any, between the ways girls and boys play with dolls of this type? The second section of the exhibition fo- cused on ritual and dolls associated with con- structing identity, conceiving and bearing 79</page><page sequence="3">children, honoring deceased infants, and pla- cating spirits. Dolls are frequently presented to girls and women by parents, fiances, or hus- bands, or they may be commissioned by the woman herself as part of a ritual process. Among the Tsonga peoples of South Africa, an initiated girl makes her own beaded doll called n'wana, or "child," and keeps it until she bears a daughter. She then makes ornaments for her baby by reusing the beads from her doll. In fer- tility-inducing rituals, Mossi women use biiga figures, which are similar to but somewhat larger than the dolls played with by girls. Why, I wondered, did Mossi women make the size distinction? Maturing Turkana girls, as well as women who have not yet had children, manip- ulate dolls referred to as nigidi ("child") to ensure fertility. The Baule figures on display required viewers to stretch their definitions of doll well beyond familiar boundaries, however broad. At the advice of a diviner, Baule men and women commission a carved wooden fig- ure, wraka sran ("wooden person"), to assuage spirits, either bush spirits or otherworld spirit lovers. Are these wooden persons dolls? Despite any limitations of definition, in each of the instances noted above, the owner cares for the image as she or he would a living person, feeding, bathing, and clothing it. Among fertility-related dolls, the Asante akua'ba is perhaps the most famous. The ex- hibition contained an abundance of akua'ba together with an incredible assortment of akua'ba's descendants. In addition to the famil- iar Asante figure, whose origins are recorded in the story of the young woman Akua and her commissioned wood carving of a small child, also accounted for were Fante and other Akan versions of similar function and configuration. Tourist industry "fakeries" and a splendid dis- play of popularized versions of akua'ba, such as small cast-metal replicas, poster designs, and Ghanaian postage stamps, expanded the discourse beyond Africa to Western adoption of the form. Akua'ba is also alive and well in south Orange County, California, where she has been sighted on key chains and worn as a charm about the necks of young women who frequently are shocked to learn of akua'ba's his- tory and purpose. Dolls in collections, including the souvenir variety, constituted the third section. On dis- play were a wide variety of images avidly gathered up by collectors, ranging from the dolls Namchi blacksmiths carve for girls and for women having difficulty conceiving a child, to the souvenir dolls women produce as part of a local tourist industry. The design of the souvenir doll generally conforms to the tourist's stereotypical notions about Africans, and is usually entirely removed from the real- ity of the situation. Thus, dolls are manufac- tured wearing costumes no longer worn by the women who make them. Dolls are potent objects. Dollmaking in Af- rica has survived Islamic prohibitions against replicating the human form. Nothing, it would seem, can deter the impulse to create them. Abstraction verging on nonrepresentation cannot blur the owner's vision of the image only she or he can love. As collectibles, dolls 80 are snapshots of a frozen past. They capture hairstyles, dress, and most important, endless memories and aspirations. But tourists are not the only collectors who are enchanted by them. Institutions also acquire and display these human replicas, and in exhibitions such as Cameron's suggest that dolls are good to think about, too. The African doll collection of Udo and Wally Horstmann provided both the inspira- tion and the nucleus for the exhibition. Betsy Quick, the Fowler's Director of Education, and her staff also merit acknowledgment. Not only did they write special panels and an exhibition guide suitable for young visitors, they also arranged a juried exhibition of dolls made by students in kindergarten through the twelfth grade. The top fifty entries were dis- played at the Fowler concurrently with "Isn't S/He a Doll?" DC A symposium, "Play and Ritual in African Art," was held in conjunction with the exhibition on November 1, 1997. The catalogue, by Elisabeth Cameron with an essay by Doran H. Ross (UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History, 1996; 124 pp., 22 b/w &amp; 148 color illustrations, map, bibliogra- phy), is availablefor $45 hardcover, $24 softcover. "Isn't S/He a Doll?" opens at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts on November 14, 1998; it closes on January 17, 1999. ART THAT HEALS The Image as Medicine in Ethiopia The Museum for African Art New York City, New York February 7-August 31, 1997 Reviewed by Raymond A. Silverman "Art That Heals" dealt with a narrowly de- fined subject: the curative and aesthetic dimen- sions of a discrete body of artifacts made and used by peoples living in the northern high- lands of Ethiopia. Its primary focus was the long strip of leather inscribed with text and graphic symbols called a healing scroll-an expression of an ancient talismanic tradition found throughout the Judaic, Muslim, and Christian cultures of the Middle East. Curated by Jacques Mercier, a French anthropologist who has been studying the arts of healing in Ethiopia for close to thirty years, this thought- provoking exhibition explored (as stated in one of the introductory panels) "the interrelation of perception and aesthetics, and of art and the body." It was, in fact, an abridged version of "Le Roi Salomon et les Maitres du Regard: Art et Medecine en Ethiopie," installed at the Musee des Arts d'Afrique et Oc6anie in Paris (October 1992-January 1993). "Art That Heals" addressed a number of related subjects that consider the relationship between healing practices and the visual arts. These were articulated as: Secret Knowledge and Healing Power, Sacrifice and the Sick Body, Visual Trance and Healing Power, Heal- ing as Salvation, The Scroll as a Synthesis of Meanings, and Contemporary Innovations. A fundamental theme that ran throughout the exhibition concerned the highly personal nature of the healing scroll tradition, particu- larly its relationship to the person for whom it was made. This theme was effectively con- veyed by the use of two types of explanatory text panels included in each of the exhibition's four sections. One was written in the first per- son singular and offered an account of the sup- plicant's history (i.e., his or her illness); the other dealt with the meanings of the scrolls on display and the significance of their imagery. An introduction to the exhibition and an overview of Ethiopia's social and cultural histo- ry greeted the entering viewer. Regrettably this orientation fell short of providing the cultural and historical context that the exhibition required. Jon Abbink's review of the Paris exhi- bition (in African Arts, Autumn 1993, pp. 74-75) reveals that most of the rich contextual pro- gram developed for the original installation was not replicated for the Museum for African Art. Indeed, my only major criticism of this show is that it relied too heavily on text as an interpretive medium. The MAA undoubted- ly was coping with budgetary constraints, but even relatively inexpensive photographic imagery (I recall only two photographs in the entire exhibition) would have greatly enhanced the viewer's understanding of and appreciation for the exhibition's objects and ideas. One then entered the first thematic section, which examined the conceptual basis for the healing scroll tradition. Here the viewer leamed of the nature of the esoteric knowledge wielded by the clerics who produce these scrolls. Thought to derive from King Solomon, this "Wisdom" is perceived in its purest form as the name of God. A text panel related that "because it predates the invention of the writ- ten word, the name of God, as it appears on scrolls-the 'Seal of God'-is not spelled. Nor, however, is it simply drawn. It is, rather, a mar- riage of image and word." The efficacy of the scroll is measured by the esoteric or secret nature of the images and words inscribed on its surface. There was a brief but informative explanation of some of these representational and abstract motifs. At a fundamental level, the tradition is grounded in ancient astrology and an understanding of the zodiac. The universe, of which humans are a part, is perceived as a "complex web of correspondences"; if they are not kept in proper alignment, illness and mis- fortune will befall a person. A display case devoted to the production of scrolls included the tools used in their manufacture as well as some of the magico-religious texts from which the inscriptions may be drawn. Particularly interesting was a rare eighteenth/nineteenth- century translation in Ge'ez (the ancient litur- gical language associated with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church) of the Shams al-Marif, a text attributed to the thirteenth-century Egyptian scholar al-Buni, which effectively demonstrat- ed the relationship between the Ethiopian heal- ing scroll and other traditions of the ancient Middle East and Mediterranean. african arts ? summer 1998</page></plain_text>
