<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESTONIA'S TIME AND MONUMENTAL TIME Maire Jaanus, Barnard College-Columbia University And long ere this I should have slain myself, Had not sweet pleasure conquered deep despair. Marlowe, Doctor Faustus Upheaval and Identity A great many processes are taking place simultaneously in Estonia: de-colonization, de-sovietization, re-nationalization, re-europeanization, globalization, postmodern ization, increasingly also the commodification and homogenization that are characteristic of the world of late multi- national capitalism, and finally, as everywhere, the displacement of reality by a simulated hyper-reality, or, more precisely, the demotion of print culture, the culture of the book, to secondary status, given the rapid advancement of instant, telematized communication and the culture of the Internet. All of this calls upon the individual to unmake and to remake his identity. It means to undo or at least to rethink the complex of symbolic nominations - starting with one's name, age, gender, nationality, profession, religion, and other such marks - that are a standard part of one's identification papers and of one's conscious civilized identity.1 It means also to continue handling the pressure of unconscious identifications, those sharp, instantaneous, and uncontrollable plus and minus flashes of love and hate, want and disgust, acceptance and rejection that register themselves in one's body, moods, and emotions and that are the real constituents and determinants of one's qualitative experience of life, the very measure of the degree of pleasure or pain one is able to harvest each day of living. Identity derives from the Latin word idem, meaning the same. In the 17th century John Locke defined personal identity as "the same thinking thing in different times and places."2 Locke's unchanging "thing" was in essence a cogito, a thinking, knowing, scientific substance, albeit depen- dent (contrary to the Descartian cogito ) on input from the empirical world. Romanticism, and subsequently Freudianism, redefined this substance as fundamentally libidinal. Desidero ergo sum says the desiring/libidinal subject; credo ergo sum says the believing subject (in Kierkegaard), but JBS, Vol. XXVIII, No 2 (Summer 1997) 125</page><page sequence="2">126 Maire Jaanus each does so only because it speaks. It is foremost the speaking subject. For Lacan, identity is the relation between the subject and the signifier. To Locke's subject, then, we added the motility of speech and desire. We are subjects that, lacking pleasure, desire to acquire it from someone else or from some otherness. Moments of felt libidinal intensification and intensity punctuate our speaking. The flow of the drives enlivens and brightens our incessant linguistic mapping. The drives give testimony to a living substance haunting language and to our belief in some kind of a substantial satisfaction. We know something of the drives because of the laws that govern the unconscious, foremost the law of repetition. What returns, what recurs, what is reaffirmed, what happens repeatedly against one's will, that is one's idem, the irreducible sameness from which one cannot escape. This unconscious idem , governed by the time of the drives, is what one may say one does not desire, but which is the unknown law by which one lives. Postmodern form and the techniques of magical realism are (as I will show below) perfectly fitted for the subject in a state of crises and upheaval such as the post- independent Baltic-Estonian subject is. In Emil Tode's Piiririik ,3 a bold dismantling of any kind of fixed or certain identity is accomplished together with (it seems to me) the distillation of a set of distinct and specific idems. What kinds of identifications are involved in these recurring, singular idemsl On what does this subject rely to retain its sense of identity? Borders, Boundaries, Barriers, Edges, Windows Estonia is a border nation as all nations are. Borders form an inside and outside. They can be crossed. All borders are fragile, shiftable, permeable, transgressable, and invadable. Estonians know this, they have been invaded so many times: by the Russians, the Germans, the Swedes, the Poles, by a variety of languages and religions, and now by commercialization, pollution, and the electronic highway. Borders are no guarantee of safety. A small nation is no safer than a body. Piiririik is a narration about borders. It recounts the narrator's relation to the existence of those that are visible and concrete and those that are merely felt and experienced, psychically and internally. The birth of boundary lines, their creation and destruction, fascinates him. The genesis of a silhouette, the appearance of an outline on a photographic negative in a development tray, in the darkroom, operates on him like a seduction (5). Merely the suggestion of an image, rather than the whole image or word, is what is most alluring and entrancing. Repeatedly, the narrator fantasizes inhabiting a Matisse painting where everything is faded, bleached out,</page><page sequence="3">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 127 erased, except for a few blue and pink lines (23, 80). An ideal novel, then, might be something sketchy, minimalist, impressionistic, composed only of image bits and parts, of mere lines of color or fragments of sound (as in Debussy) that the reader might either play with or constitute into wholes. Such a novel would correspond to his life, which he sees as equivalent to an empty room where nothing happens. "No, of course, occasionally, something happens to me...." But what happens expires, like a dream that one forgets and that fades away before it begins (23). Life is merely different emergences that dissolve before being fully realized or understood. The outlines abate before becoming filled in or acquiring substance, and with substance - duration. The happenings do not develop into a canonical narration. A line is a cut that divides and differentiates. It maps, carves out, and makes possible the segregate space of nations and narrations as well as human sexual, social, and political relations. Lines allow for the creation of the otherness of subjects and objects. They are the incipience of a form or of an object, the necessary severance or division without which there is nothing, or mere indistinct nondifferentiation. Separations and breaks, however, also permit encounters and recognitions. The line separates "me" and "you," but also incites identification, and stirs erotic desire. "Neither culture nor its destruction," as Barthes said, "is erotic: it is the seam between them, the fault, the flaw which becomes so."4 Sex and eroticism are precisely on the border between you and me, as Jefferson's bed was between two rooms (110), whereas that of Louis XIV was at the exact center of the palace of Versailles.5 The boundary itself, the between, is the exiting cause of seeing and desiring. "It is intermittence ... which is erotic: the intermittence of skin flashing between two articles of clothing... between two edges.... it is this flash itself which seduces, or rather: the staging of an appearance- as-disappearance."6 As a work of art, Piiririik is preeminently such a staging, we glimpse everything and are sure of nothing, not even of the murder, the central action. We are as if the readerly voyeurs of what might become an orthodox novel, perverted by textual fragments that make us take our pleasure where we can, everywhere, along the constantly shifting sets of two edges. The subversive edge may seem privileged because it is the edge of violence; but it is not violence which affects pleasure, nor its destruction which interests it; what pleasure wants is the site of a loss, the seam, the cut, the deflation, the dissolve which seizes the subject in the midst of bliss. Culture thus recurs as an edge: in no matter what form.7</page><page sequence="4">1 28 Maire Jaanus One of the protagonist's favorite settings is the staircase, located between two levels, where one can stand dramatically, leaving others guessing whether one will descend or ascend (113). The most significant period of his emotional life is similarly set on a seam, a between, that of pain and pleasure. A blissful and oxymoronic "sweet unhappiness" dominated his life's most beautiful years (75). Happiness, then, is not fulfillment, but a state of desire and longing, that border between the pain of not-having and the pleasurable fantasy of having. Fulfillment, in fact, brings disgust. Why, the narrator asks, given that his lovemaking with Franz was wild and astonishingly satisfying, did he despise him so much, remaining aware only of his pathetic eyes and his hairy hands (79)? Is it because he retains a more precious memory of other hands, priestly and pure, that he never possessed, but merely desired? Unfulfilled desire is more powerful than possession. Once a border has been mapped of a nation or a body, it can seem to offer protection. As an enclosure, it can be reinforced by a defensive wall, or be marked by an edge or a gate. Boundaries try to forbid or limit access, as the ropes in museums do that cut visitors off from certain areas (110). But every rope, law, or closed window (such as the permanently shut one in his grandmother's house, which he was never allowed to open), also invites transgression (8). Every enclosure can come to seem like a confinement which one wants to escape or to smash through. Boundaries may be the limit of a taboo, inviting obedience or disobedience, operating to create morality. There are no ethics without boundaries. Bodies in space are more separate than nations are, and yet, they are porous, and permeable by the other's gaze and voice. Literatures are separated into distinct languages, and yet, they are to a degree translatable, and therefore, transmittable and betrayable. The narrator is himself a translator, working in the interstices of two languages, French and another unnamed one.8 Languages are wall-less, but unlike dreams, where anyone, dead or alive, from any time can enter (88), languages are open only up to a point. Finally, each language is something absolutely unique and untranslatable. Because the identification with a language is an unconscious identification with meaningless sounds, the narrator can momentarily feel that there is no language he understands, and yet that there is only one language and that he comprehends none other (90-1). Native languages are like love; finally, there is, inexplicably, only one real love, the unique and special one, the only one whom one ever really wants (always the singular mother and mother tongue). Stubborn singularity is a characteristic of an unconscious idem. In chemistry, the space between the cells is where the energy resides. The space between human beings is libidinally charged. Space, like silence,</page><page sequence="5">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 129 tends to be filled. It is the place where all action commences. Thus, the space between is the site of bridging, birthing, binding, and translation, or of conflict and murder. It is also the space where intermixing, adultery, contamination, impurity, and hybridization occur. The narrator himself is a hybrid, the mixed offspring of an unnamed, never mentioned, and seemingly dead father and a possibly Polish or half-Polish, mostly absent mother, who rarely remembers him (102) and who was brought out of Siberia by a "grandmother," who is in fact not related to him or his mother at all. There is a tenuous connection of love: the step-grandmother seems to have loved the man whose daughter his mother is, but by a another woman, a Polish woman who died in Siberia (90). His origins reach into the unknowable human relationships, the sorrows, loves, and deaths of Eastern Europeans in the Communist death camps. The author, aware of the fragility and provisional nature of most borders, of their constructed and fictional nature, and of the perilous consequences of crossings, looks for narrative beginnings and endings, the borders of writing, to find that these also are no longer given. Beginnings are random and endings may have to be made by force (7-8, 163). The outline of an "I," a narrator, the minimum that is necessary to begin a narration, depends on the coming into being of a "you," of an other towards whom this "I" can direct its fundamental fantasies and words of desire. Speaking always entails a listener even if no one is there. The "I" is a border that knows itself as an entity through the words of a "you" who says: "You have strange eyes, you would as if seem to watch the world, you are not French" (5). In the beginning are the words of the other that define the self, define it as a look and as not-French. It is a negative definition, like Freud's of the woman as not-male. Thus, the narrator appears in outline through the words of the other just as the photograph is born in outline out of nothingness. Angelo, his "you," is his fantasy, the nothing that makes him want something, that maintains his eroticism, his drive for an object, and his drive to write. His drive to write covers over what is an unarrestable mute bawling at his core, a bawling at his own emptiness and nothingness (his misery over his grandmother's death and his bad grade in writing, his need to grow up, betray, kill, and forget, as all grownups do), and his inability to escape from anything he ever was, from himself as the child crying mutely for its mother, in the place that he will forever be in, a stinking toilet, this, his place "at the end of the world" (65). Writing and love give him a new desire and dream and, therefore, a temporary distance from his painful emptiness. The never fully satisfied drives (not needs that can be satisfied) keep living alive just as the unsayable keeps saying alive.</page><page sequence="6">1 3 0 Maire Jaanus A first line an artist draws as the initial word a writer writes create (as does Heideggger's vase) a void and with it the possibility of filling it. "Emptiness and fullness are introduced into a world that by itself knows nothing of them. It is on the basis of this fabricated signifier, this vase," as Lacan says, "that emptiness and fullness as such enter the world."9 Language itself may be the cause of our perception of being and nothingness. The vase (or language), therefore, is "the object made to represent the existence of the emptiness at the center of the real that is called the Thing, this emptiness as represented in the representation presents itself as nihil, as nothing."10 The narrator knows himself as the empty Thing (or vase) that desires fullness from another. His "sin" or "evil deed" in the world may in fact be nothing more than continuing to write and to speak although he knows himself as a nothing with nothing to say except that writing and speaking help him to maintain his sense of his own being while they may, at the same time, be the cause of his sense of nonbeing. When one has crossed all the boundaries that can be crossed, of which the heterosexual boundary is but one, one longs for further boundaries, new frontiers or, perhaps, for boundaries that cannot be crossed, for the uncrossable, the absolutely lawful, for punishment, even for death, or for immortality. Perhaps the narrator fantasizes the murder just to evoke the law, to bring it back, or at the least to reveal that he remembers Camus' work. Perhaps he is trying to force the law to make itself manifest as it did in The Stranger after the act of murder, or perhaps he is trying only to make himself visible by an extreme act, but here the law does not manifest itself: the newspaper cites and reports a suicide instead. And he himself, a stranger in Europe, remains invisible." He escapes, he is not punished. There is no sentence. There are no boundaries and no law. Murder and/or suicide are the two ways to evoke the law. But no one is watching and nothing one does, not even murder, can bring back the dead law. On one side, Estonia is bounded by a shallow, stony, and treacherous sea. The sea exerts a magical and deadly attraction on the narrator, pulling him as if involuntarily to its edges and into itself. The border between land and sea is a place to which he repeatedly returns, in Paris, in Estonia, and at the end of his story, somewhere in Europe. It is an encounter with a liquid, saline otherness that tempts, challenges, and lures him. He fantasizes breaking into this watery domain and being immersed in this different element, or being shipwrecked there, where lighthouse beacons shine to no avail. At the edge between land and sea, then, one confronts death. The awareness of the boundary of one's own mortality and the temptation to cross it inhabit the narrator and the people of the North in general, for as he says, the temptation of death is great in that land (11).</page><page sequence="7">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 131 Yet, when this becomes the greatest desire, there is the desire for immortality to oppose it. At this edge of land and sea, one may find a ship (the upside down one in the form of the roof of a church), that might serve to rescue the dead from their mortal place of burial beneath the floors of this same church (95). Heaven is, at these moments in the text, indicated as a place reached with the aid of ships and beacons through the element of water. On the other two sides, farms abut on dark and cold forests that are for the narrator signs of the end of human life and civilization, and a lake blocks any kind of escape. The forest, a domain of nonhuman nature and animals, is a different kind of limit. It is the place where Estonians went to die, knowingly yielding their bodies to forest animals as food, while the soul escaped in the form of a bird to heaven. The forest, though a forbidding graveyard, is also a natural and pagan site from which heaven and immortality can be reached. Moreover, the forest also yields green sorrel for sucking to vitamin-deprived children with glowing, animal-like eyes (10). In the nineteenth century, Northern Europe was still often subject to famines, although Central Europe was already enjoying bourgeois well-being, having restructured itself according to the principles of Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. We depended on the forest. The forest fed us. The forest is our mother. The final border leads towards sunlight and the other Eastern European countries, "the row of dark and poverty-stricken nations that powerlessly lament their stillborn histories" (12). The history of nation-making and of religion reached the Baltics belatedly and always in either authoritarian or totalitarian forms, as colonization and enslavement. Every boundary is a fault line, a break in continuity, a fracture of and shift in reality, a dislodging of reality so that adjacent surfaces are differentially displaced parallel to the plane of fracture. A small nation whose edges are almost visible, with boundaries close to its center, may be most representative of a century close to its millennial end as well as of a civilization at its limits such as that of the West. Piiririik gives an account of the fault lines or the displaced and fractured state of Estonia's history (and by extension that of all Eastern Europe). It also sets forth the psychic boundary condition of its subjects. The Edges of Time The edges upon which the narrator most often stands are edges of time. Which time, then, does he feel is most his own? What time is he speaking from? What is his time? Which time does he value? Which does he wish to escape from?</page><page sequence="8">1 32 Maire Jaanus Psychically, the narrator often finds himself positioned in various times simultaneously. Fragments of disparate times, both actual and imaginary, appear together, pulling him in different directions with great force and insistence. These different time moments become condensed and overlap metaphorically. For example, he catches himself eating not only one apple (as Eve and Adam did) but four: there are the tasteless apples he buys from the Arab on the streets of Paris, which have nothing in common with the apple he imagined eating, but are like the half-apple he used to share with his grandmother in his childhood. This was while trying not to listen to her all too often retold, bitter stories about the horrors of Siberia (she has at least five particularly traumatic memories and therefore five stories that she obsessive-compulsively repeats), an act of inattentiveness for which he got beaten with the strap of the Singer sewing machine that had accompanied her to Siberia (84, 102-3). And there are the apples he stole and ate during his poor student days at the university while reading Dostoevsky, which made him cry in the middle of a lecture because he remembered Myshkin, the Christ figure, in The Idiot (100-105). Historically, the narrator identifies himself as a child of the 19th cen- tury, of which fragments of his life in Paris remind him, such as the furniture in his hotel room (53), but he is uncertain that such a century exists or that the country, where he remembers it as existing, has any reality still except in his imagination and memory. Yet, it is to this place-time that he is drawn and to its people; it is what haunts him, begets his attention, and returns to him in his dreams: "Today I again saw grandmother in my dreams" (88). Thus, when certain flowers in the Tuileries garden remind him of the natural ones of his childhood, he thinks that he should make sure that the chickens have not gotten into the yard, and when a dark cloud appears over the Place de la Concorde, he thinks the hay must be covered over before it rains. The flowers are like a remnant of another, naive and older world, "the nineteenth century, my world" (81). This century is past, dead, perished (17), lost, distant (27), backward (73), improbable, even unthinkable (21). It is as uneventful as was waiting on interminable store lines for inedible, moldy sausages that his grand- mother, nonetheless, claimed were fit enough for them to eat (164). He wants to escape the technological backwardness, primitive deprivations, and general poverty of that time and place, the absence of metros and of modern bathrooms and kitchens. And, at the same time, he wants this place and its nineteenth century atmosphere to continue to exist. He wants to think that there still are people there worrying about hay for their cows and the state of their fishing boat, with a seemingly casual attitude towards money that says to those one is accepting it from that one is doing them a favor (43). Emotionally, he identifies with these people as he does readily</page><page sequence="9">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 133 with everyone working on the fields or close to the land (180, 184). He wants above all to be infinitely distant from the hordes of shoppers of the postmodern, multinational capitalist world, from the window-shop fixated and possession-obsessed mall people, roaming like nomads from one shopping center to the next across the globe (55, 82). He does not want to accept his inherited 19th-century time, which he knows to be obsolete, poor, cruel, and authoritarian. He wants to escape the strictures, boundaries, beliefs, and slogans of that century (165), with its excessive belief in the power of language, literature, history, education, and especially, poetry writing (almost a national mania) as something signi- fying much more than it did (1 56). And yet, he also does not want to deny his past, the bedbugs or the Singer sewing machine (166). He wants a ship to take him away from the edge of the potato field of his grandmother's half-brother where he is standing even today, without knowing what to do, or at least to take him more swiftly through life so that he would no longer be frightened of time in which nothing seems to be happening for him (168-9). He really feels that only a stronger, outside force could rescue him from his outmodedness, belatedness, invisibility, and marginality but he has no faith in a higher power or in the very rescue that he wants. His history with its complex, different time-scales is frightening and uncomfortable, but so are the alternatives: the commodified time of the shoppers; Franz's ahistorical and sterile comforts; the hyperreality of Jean-Pierre, who listens to simulated nature sounds on CD's and photographs scenes constructed for the imaginary life of Barbie doll (her birthday, funeral, etc.) (145-6). Compared to such artificial and commercialized hypertime, his 19th century was innocent, substantial, and sacred, a time and place where tombstones carried scriptural messages, such as: "I am not dead, but risen" (43), and where graveyards, directly adjoined to churches, attested to a belief in the instant cancellation of mortality by immortality. In that century, he heard a hollow voice say, seemingly only to a few dead or dying parishioners: "Hear now the word of God" (73). A pair of priestly hands seemed as if to try to show him an opening beyond the borders of the earth as such (77). Unconsummated love taught him that true belief does not give way to earthly fulfillment and that the condition of absolute love is the acceptance of impossibility and of a border that can never be crossed in life. From his relationship with a young pastor, who seemed to be unaware of the fact that his century and teachings had ended, that they had been thrown into the garbage together with everything else (139-40), he acquired a sense for the ritualistic order and motion of the liturgical calendar that subtly infects his awareness and text. From him, he received the gift of a special time within time. Thus, the narrator knows,</page><page sequence="10">1 34 Maire Jaanus however seemingly tangentially, indifferently, ironically, sarcastically, or negatively, that time can also be marked as the moments of the passage of the Christ figure through life. Liturgical time is a cyclical and nonhistorical reiteration of the stages in the life and death of Christ. Thus, Good Friday, the day of the crucifixion and death, when His flesh was nailed to the wood, is the day of the narrator's departure from Estonia (21). Pentecost, the seventh Sunday after Easter, commemorating the descent of the Spirit upon the disciples, is the day of the murder (172). Corpus Christi Day, celebrating the body of Christ and its eternal presentness as flesh and blood in the Eucharist, finds him in a park refreshed by the coolness that is coming after the summer heat and fever, and blessing it, and with it, the climate of the North as the necessary balance to the sun and light that he has been in such desperate pursuit of (161-2). Somehow, always, what he is brought back to is the fact that embedded in the 19th century which he rejects is the time that he feels to be his true time-space, his innermost psychic time, his actual home ( päriskodu ) (73). The end of the novel finds him on his way to celebrate mass in a village church (181-2). There he encounters the same priest he had in the church in Amsterdam, (and in his dreams as a beggar), who had asked him: "But do you know where you are from?" - the fundamental question of identity (97-8, 182). His answer: Eastern Europe, is only a conscious national identification which reveals nothing, as he is aware, about his fundamental, unconscious relation to life and death. In his deepest origins, which does he believe in, life or death? Philosophy is about death (it teaches us how to die, as we learned from Socrates), and religion is about life. Whose side is he on, that of Franz, the bankrupt European metaphysician, who teaches his students about the meaninglessness of life (67)12 or that of the priest? He must choose: death or the ship.13 Thus, dislocated both in space and time, the narrator does not seem ever to know whether he is standing on the right line, and he always worries whether he is in the wrong place (3 1 ). His relationship to time is as undefinable as are his genealogical origins and his relationship to speech and writing. He is not sure that he wants to speak at all, or to write, or for that matter to live. When he approaches the ultimate boundary, however, he does not let the hand, arising out of the water, pull him in. He remains with his letters - testifying to his uncertainties, perversities, and violence - in his hands, on the shore. He is no more certain of time than of his faith, or his human rights. Having human rights is something that he is not used to, and he doubts that his right to demand rights could last long or that even that of others is eternal (31). Time is as inexplicable as his bouts of happiness are. Suddenly, he is causelessly happy. Then, he wants to live</page><page sequence="11">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 135 a thousand years before he dies (80-81). Then, he feels that the world and he himself are borderless. Then, time has no boundaries. To suffer is to experience borders, to be happy is to feel unbounded, expansive, voluminous. Psychic time with its dislocated chronology is itself an ultimate figure for a boundless transgression of borders, for the polyphonic, interflowing musicality of memories in the body and language. The relativity of tem- poral experiences makes Aristotle's notions of narrative linearity and his order of beginnings, middles, and ends inapt for the task of representing the postmodern subject. Struggling in a polyphony of temporalities, not knowing which time to give way to, he becomes familiar with the qualitative differences within time. Different temporalities make him feel differently, differently about himself, the other, about space, and Estonia. Time can feel male or female, maternal or paternal. Time can acquire volume and build itself up into a space or it can be a strictly linear path or way. Historical Time and Monumental Time In her essay entitled "Women's Time," Julia Kristeva defines two different notions of time: historical time and monumental time.14 Historical time is linear, productive, masculine, civilizational, and obsessional. Historical time (mostly in its Hegelian and various post-Hegelian modes) is time as a prospective unfolding and development, governed by the imperatives of the project, of work, and growth, and guided by a telos, a purposefulness oriented to a goal. This means individual endeavor, aspiration, action, responsibility, and guilt. The linearity of historical time operates like sentences in language do. Sentences have beginnings and endings. They end as time does. Thus, linguistic and linear temporality make explicit death and rupture, that which other temporalities work to conceal. And death, allied to the above imperatives of work and achievement, tends to make historical time obsessive." Time itself becomes the absolute and ever-present master for whom the slave indefatigably works. There are always deadlines to meet; there is always another work or project waiting; there is never enough time. The concern with the proper use of time and the mastery of time brings on the anguish of the end of time, of our death, and of the apocalypse. Time for the narrator is, at moments, extreme fear of its end, it is himself as the child crying under its blanket because he dreams of war,16 and wakes up, afraid that his grandmother may have died, or that the apocalypse has indeed come and left him all alone, without a world</page><page sequence="12">1 3 6 Maire Jaanus (116-117). He suffers intensely from what Marguerite Duras called the malady of death. At other moments, since endings have to come, he finds himself in consent with them, even hastening them along with his desire for destruction and murder. The anxiety of waiting for various endings, such as that of love, narratives, language, and history becomes intolerable. He fantasizes that humans themselves may become superfluous, part of the general trash to be carted away, in a thoroughly mechanized and de-naturalized world that is no longer a habitat for anything living ~ plant, animal or human (150). Trash is what is not remembered. With the aid of language, humans invented memory and history in order to be remembered, but trash is non-memory. The disposability of everything, the turning of everything into garbage (the manifest symbol of the death drive and the narrator's depressive state), seems to be infecting history and memory itself, enfeebling the memory of human deeds and words. The written word itself, our margin of life beyond death, seems to have reached its limit and ultimate boundary. Still, beyond his skepticism and depressive-nihilistic moments, the narrator counts on his letters becoming part of the memory chain that verifies that he has lived and spoken (34). 17 "Words mean nothing" (92). Yet, he cannot do without them. To get love, he depends on their power of seduction (93), and against all odds, he hopes that his written text will survive an oncoming general forgetting. Piiririik is a text punctuated by drives of destruction, the will to criminality and to evil, and moments of intense depression, as frequently as it is by the positive life drives.18 Audaciously and recklessly, the narrator admits to his lust to undo or, at the least, to match every affirmatively charged impulse with a negatively charged one. He wants, voluntarily, what Camus' Meursault got involuntarily, his orgy in the sun and death (20). He admits that violence and violation give him a sharp, powerful incursion of pleasure and a sense of victory (19)." He wants to push Franz into the canal, or under the tram (38, 48); to destroy property, especially Franz's kitchen (19); to leave a small bomb at the opera that would cause a maximum of destruction (68).20 Whatever he adores, he wants also to destroy and to hurt, and he wants himself to be hurt, manhandled, molested, and violated (26). His destructive impulses come upon him with irresistible force. Their intensity derives from their support in the absolute and sadistic power of death.21 He is on "trial" in the text to give testimony, not to his civil izational self, which exists, but to the deeper sado-masochistic impulses which he fantasizes and feels. There is a "sweetness" (37) in the expression of all drives regardless of whether they are positive or negative, and there is enjoyment in the sense of absolute power over an other that the sadistic drives yield. The</page><page sequence="13">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 137 dominated and helpless other assures the self that it exists, and that it exists, moreover, as a force and power. The narrator knows that he would enjoy seeing Franz's hands waving helplessly in the air were he to push him into the canal (38). Franz's helpless hands would also be his reversal and compensatory revenge on another pair of hands that once made him feel helpless. The narrator wants to crush Franz for his abject love for him, for his sexual neediness, his martyr-like and masochistic trust, his passion for moral themes and ethics, but he knows that his sadistic antipathy (48-9) arises from his recognition that Franz's neediness is his own. This identificatory sameness with the other, the unowned negative idem, fills him with disgust. And disgust is a sign of entry into the domain of the real and of mastery by unconscious impulses.22 He wants to "murder" in the other what he cannot annihilate in himself. What he can neither eradicate nor fulfill in himself is his fundamental want of being. Historical time is a time of the signifier, concerned with meaning (and nonmeaning). It cannot supply the fundamental, unconscious want for being. Only love gives being. And love can give a sense of being even in nonbeing. With Angelo the narrator can be in nothingness, at the nullpoint, where there is silence and not even the sound of breathing. He loves Angelo because Angelo admits to his nullity. The narrator wants the experience of wothing because he is sick to death of people who want •something (58). What the lover and beloved want is what each lacks. This want shows up as the undercurrent of speech. It is the dimension of the unsaid in speech, the ever indirect presence of desire that haunts speech. The obsessive is scared off by the other's demand for love and by the exposure of his need. The narrator gets one lover a dog just to stop him from repeatedly saying: I love you, I need you. He does not want to be needed and to supply the other's need (141). The hysteric, who feels most intensely his own need, tries to make the other feel incomplete so that he will be needed, so that there will be a place for him in the other. The hysteric is ever afraid of not being wanted. The hysteric-obsessive core in us does not want to recognize that the other whom we pursue is as lacking in being as the one we spurn and hopes as much to attain love from us as we hope to attain it from them. We all desire to have more being. The satisfaction of the drive is not in linear time. The time of the drive is a time of encounter, structured like an instant, which operates as a cut in the continuity of the time of the signifier or of signifying speech. The structure of the drive's satisfaction is like the sudden awakening of a perceptual sense - a glimpse, sound, touch, taste - in which we sense an answer to the question whether there is a place for us in the other. The drive</page><page sequence="14">1 3 8 Maire Jaanns is silent, but it answers the question. Thus, it is not the time of the signifier that gives an answer to our inexorable desire for being (or a nonbeing different from destruction). The time of the signifier fulfills our desire for meaning, but not for being. The time of the signifier could, in fact, run on without humans just as Franz's telephone answering machine continues to play his message and to accept messages after he is dead (34, 1 52-3).23 Historical, linear time wants, at all times, SOMETHING, something solid and substantial, some concrete attainment or meaning, and that makes for an obessional culture, preoccupied with the polarities of achievement and failure, with scientific knowledge and ignorance. But we are never completely or exclusively historical beings. Intense drives, whether within the boundaries of the normal, such as love, or in the abnormal states of neurosis, perversion, and psychosis, displace us from historical time. Because historical-linear culture supports the awareness of limits, it opens us up (especially since the Renaissance and the demise of religion) to obessional suffering from time anxiety and death anxiety, and to the temptation of death or its derivatives, such as the drive for destruction. By destruction, we can become identified with (and thus escape) the greatest power of all, death, the absolute aggressor. By contrast, monumental time is a sense of unbroken or recurring time, ruptureless, super-historical, or mythical. It is either a form or type of eternity or a form of repetition. For Kristeva, monumental time is also more female, maternal, mystical, ecological, spatial, and hysterical. Above all, monumental time is always present. Presentness is one of its absolute characteristics. It is a now, not pastness, or the future. It is not outdated or outmoded, it does not become yesterday or lost time. Thus, the word temporality hardly fits it. The massive presence of monumental time gives it the quality of space or of a place. It is a kind of spatial time because it returns to the same place. It is a time indissociable from space, a space-time, all-encompassing and infinite like imaginary space. Space, as Kristeva' s work has elaborated, is fundamental and originary. Spatial references are learned before temporal ones and induce the child's laugh and then the entire range of symbolic manifestations which lead eventually to sign and syntax. Space is, therefore, also connected to the maternal, to woman, and to the earth. We know that place can be a gratifying substitute for old deficiencies in the maternal space. In psychosis, space must be repaired before transference and communication are possible. We also know that the hysteric, because she suffers from reminiscences, is linked to recurrence and cyclical time. She relates to her own place, foremost her body, and past in a repetitious way. Her orientation in the body and bodily space also bring her closer to the</page><page sequence="15">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 139 feminine and to maternal experience. Because she repeats and remains in the same space, she is allied to the constancy and repetitiousness of monumental time. Monumental time is a semiotic space that defies language. History, an artifice produced by language and narcissism, creates memories of battles, of heroes and victims, of revenge (in the slaves) or remorse (in the masters). It is not concerned with the otherness of god, ghosts, or nature, but with the mere otherness of humans, in different times and places, speaking different languages. Monumental time, however, does concern itself with the gods and the cosmos. It pays attention to the divine and immortal, to unending time, infinite and eternal. The time of the drives that it evokes is not that of destruction and death but of preservation and life. Monumental time also cares for the forms of natural or elemental life in their cyclical and recurring time, and for metamorphosis, the free interflow of all the forms of the universe. In monumental time, boundaries in general between all things are looser or cease to exist. The narrator readily imagines sliding into other elemental forms or displacing his body into an other domain, the water, earth, or sky. The death in the forest, mentioned above, that he recounts, is a type of metamorphosis, a transgressive experience in the natural world, pagan and sublime. There is no fear of death. Animals will carry off one's bones, and one's soul will become a bird. The body is natural and belongs to cyclical time. The soul belongs to eternal time. Both are a part of monumental time. Bodies are older than language. Their material connects us to the ecology and to the elements. Perhaps it is some ancient affinity that is responsible for our fantasies of metamorphoses, of our return to matter, and our drive to objecthood? The narrator wants the unhuman, riddance of his merely anthropomorphic form. The human itself is a limit, a boundary, an untruth, our dividedness from what is more ancient and enduring than we are. He wants to be dehumanized and assume the neutrality of an object in nature, become the sea grass that grows only for itself (25, 147). The kingdom (riik) of seeds is victorious over men and he would wish to share it, to be with the victors, and renounce and betray his unhappy race (25). Yet, he wants also his rapturous, human sense experiences, his Proustian memories of odors, tastes, and touch that allow him to imagine comparing the taste of Angelo's semen to the juice of the sea grass growing on the shore. The presence of monumental time and its signs punctuate the text more surely and with more joy than the presence of historical time does. His most rapturous moments all connect to his origins, his "there," the cold Nordic geography with its absence of sun and technology, its distinct cultural-religious memory, and its unique linguistic sedimentation, where</page><page sequence="16">1 40 Maire Jaanus the natural odors are strong and the air invigorating, and where life, perhaps because it resists one, because it has to be wrested from nothingness and poor soil, is real and not virtual, hyperreal, or artificial as it appears more often now to be in the West. "There" is where he has had his most positive drive experiences, his instants of being and love. "There" is his irreducible difference, his unconscious idem, a specificity that he knows is his because the brutal depreciation of it by the discourse of power or the idea of his complete renunciation of it induces uncontrollable rage. Thus, the narrator experi- ences it as violence to and violation of his core, when the European Franz, disparagingly says: of course, you do not want to return "there" (no normal person would renounce the Paris I offer you to return instead "there"), repeating "there" four times (172-3), without ever even deigning to name this seemingly unmentionable place or in fact, therefore, non-place. The depth of the narcissistic injury can be measured by the narrator's counter-action, his imagined or actual murder of Franz in a sudden emergence from passivity. He counter-invests in the violence he has endured, making himself in turn an agent of this violence, in order to combat what he experienced as an annihilatory attack on his affective life as an Estonian. He is an Eastern European, but also a European: he has read Derrida and Foucault, he does not keep his money in socks, he's not a slave (41-2). Europe has always been the larger human ensemble, superior to the nation, within which the Estonian re-experienced his major national traits in accentuated form, and yet Europe seems now unwilling to reabsorb him, to recognize him, and to honor him for his suffering and loyalty, simply because, due to a predacious colonial occupation and historical circumstances beyond his control, he is poorer and less powerfully positioned.24 Terrorism, Kristeva argues, tends to justify its acts on the unconscious level by reference to the archaic good mother. The act of terror is committed in her behalf so that her reign of purity and plenty can be reinstated in lieu of what has become an evil world. If this is so, perhaps Estonian non-violence has not only to do with a sobriety derived from a rational awareness of smallness, fragility, and limits, or a passivity induced by colonial oppression, but also from the fact that in Estonian culture the image of the archaic good mother tends often to be displaced by a grandmother, or as here, a step-grandmother, archaic, somewhat grim, but strong and stoical, able to survive Siberia together with her sewing machine (symbol of work and self-sufficiency), and ever sparing in what she gives, especially as regards love and words. She is like the geographic place itself, so harsh and peculiar, that it cannot be forgotten because to survive within it one has to know it; one has to be as intimate with it as with one's own</page><page sequence="17">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 141 flesh. She is the earthmother, who long ago taught us to expect little, and in particular, so little pleasure that our incapacity to demand the right, especially to the pursuit of happiness, keeps us from the delusion of thinking that our happiness could ever come from the killing off of the other.25 The boon of our dark souls is that we leave the other alone. "No guns, no Palestine," our leaders said during the Independence Movement,26 and our ability to adhere to that, while living beside the descendants of those who commandeered our genocide, allows us to leave to the world a rare and extraordinary example of non-violence. We have had little opportunity to demand much in reality and historical-linear time because these could not yield us much and, therefore, we have always remained acquainted with monumental time. A New Ethics of Time Different civilizations have linked themselves differently to time, and perhaps one of the profound differences between Western European civilization and other major civilizations, such as the Indian, for example, is in the relationship to time. We are the first civilization ever, "the first epoch in human history, in which human beings attempt to live without religion."27 The strength of the Western tradition of atheism is unique. It is almost impossible to avoid encountering it if one is educated in the West, given the predominance of non-religious or even defiantly anti-religious thinkers among the greatest modern humanists and scientists of its tradition. The narrator is keenly aware of the spiritual emptiness of his life and of the fact that in his civilization, monumental time has been relegated to a secondary and inferior position. His allusions to the emptiness of churches, the barely audible sound of church bells (117), random biblical fragments, and piece-meal bits of the Christian calendar of time run like an elegiac refrain through his work because he had once an "adventure in faith." His writing and need for an Angelo are a rememoration of that time and his substitutes for something missing in his life. Angelo is the desired Beatrice, who, however, is more like a Dulcinea or a Helena from whom Faust asks, as all lovers do of the beloved, what she cannot give: "Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss."28 In our materialized societies, the bodily and amorous life substitutes for the spiritual life. "The flesh is altogether ready, my Angelo, but the spirit is nowhere" (178). There is some kind of an interconnectedness between religion and his love for Angelo, between religion and sexuality, but he doesn't know what that is. The division of the sexes maintains the fantasy of fusion with someone. But according to Lacan, a deeper core fantasy beneath the sexual fantasy</page><page sequence="18">1 42 Maire Jaanus is that of a fiision with something. Before birth, before being split from the real, we were unified with something or the immortal Thing. Individuation and birth, therefore, are bought at the price of immortality. Instead of immortality, we have sex and death. We have the sexual divide into gender, and with that the pleasures of sex, but we must procreate and die. Freud posited religious need in the domain of reality (the order of the imaginary), where also love is. Religion is an extension of the need for the father or mother, for other humans. But Lacan places need in the order of the real. Birth, as a splitting from the Thing opens up a lack for something, for a being that is more fundamental than the lack for another human being. It is the sense of the profound insufficiency of our own being separated from the Thing. And no earthly love can supply our want for the Thing that accompanies each of us through life.29 God, as Lacan said, is perhaps the most profound symptom of this deeper lack of being. God is present, therefore, in the order of the real. He is part of the need for the real. God is the real, not reality. The repression of monumental time and of the religious dimension in our civilization is a repression of a part of the domain of the real. This causes an imbalancing of the imaginary and the symbolic orders. It is an imbalance that leads to the production of violence and psychosis as well as an overabundance of technology and art. The want for the more primordial being, for the Thing, registers itself not only in the relationship to religion, or in various ways in the love relationship (such as the spiritual demands placed upon the lover for immortality or the sexual demands placed upon the body or the disgust at the limits of the body etc.), or in the relationship to silence [the narrator's constant reference to Jane Campion's film, The Piano, particularly to the scene of the heroine and the piano in silence under the water, as he imagines himself to be (54-5, 164, 50)], but also in the relationship to the ecology, to nature, to landscape, and soil, a relationship which has been constant and profound in Estonian literature. It is in nature, as our nature poetry and literature attests, that "sweet pleasure has conquered deep despair."30 It is in the isolation and silence of nature where the inconsolable have gone to be consoled, and where the unfree have had glimpses of freedom, beauty, and peace (as in Kitzberg's Werewolf), however briefly. Silence gives the narrator distance from words and gives him back his closeness to things. The moments of a feeling of completion in this text are also moments when the narrator's body and senses interface with the life of nature. They are moments of the now in monumental time. Historical time was the characteristic and dominant time of the age of traditional nationalism. This nationalism had desires, inherited from the enlightenment and romanticism, for all types of equality, for equal rights,</page><page sequence="19">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 143 status, power, and recognition. Nations sought an individual place within linear history and an identification with its logic and values. The Independence Movement at its opening drew on the experiences, symbols, and memories of this earlier nationalism only to learn that this form of nationalism was to some extent obsolete. It encountered a new Europe, within which the primacy of national histories was being challenged by the European Union, and which was under attack by its former colonies, called to accounts for its imperialist past. "The empire writes back" and Europe has to answer.31 The history of nations has become the history of civilizations. Each nation and each civilization has to acquire the skills to interrelate with other larger civilizational and cultural entities, often very distant from the European. Emerging suddenly, raped and violated, from its claustrophobic isolation within Communist totalitarianism, Eastern Europe finds that it has to adjust itself with great rapidity to shifts that occurred gradually in the rest of Europe over a fifty-year period. This raises new questions for Eastern Europeans. How can the geography, language, and historical memory that we call the Estonian nation be modified and yet preserved? How much of the otherness of others can Estonia absorb before its own national-cultural difference is blown to smithereens? How other can it be without ceasing to be?32 The narrator is no longer sure about the existence of nations since as he says, nations still exist on maps, but their populations are overflowing and jumping national borders like fleas (13). He also lacks enthusiasm for history. Historical time has been the imperialist's time, the conqueror's time, and it is therefore not his time (12). History is always a negative experience for the colonized, for those subjugated and mastered by the imperial other. The exhilaration of history is mainly for the masters, for those who control and dominate. History, in fact, has the face of a Medusa, bringing on chills by how it reveals the tolerance of humans for killing and their ready ability to shift indifferently from slaughter to pleasure (108-9). Franz envies the narrator the excitement of the recent historical upheavals in Eastern Europe, but the protagonist is skeptical and tells him in his world-weary way that one can get along perfectly well without history and more comfortably so (140). If Piiririik is the representative text of a new generation that no longer finds its inspiration primarily in historical or national time, what, then, does inspire this new generation? What is its desire? What the new Nordic, Baltic-Estonian subject wants is a new ethics of time. It wants a new kind of temporality altogether, less exclusionary and less divided. This more inclusive ethics of time acknowledges, alongside national and historical time, the need for monumental temporalities. It accepts that these nonhistorical, nonproductive, and immaterial temporal-</page><page sequence="20">1 44 Maire Jaaniis ities may tell us far more about how people live and die within a given culture than the time of measurable production does. This new, enlarged ethics of time allows breaks within itself, for the appearance of ghosts, hallucinations, and distorted sensations of inexplicable strangeness. It sees us as always standing on this border between mortality and immortality and protects the want for spaces of timelessness and immortality, the want for other space-times of metamorphosis, faith, and adoration. It admits the need to escape from historical time, even though this want may be rooted in nothing more exalted than our ultimate, primary narcissism, our desire to perpetuate ourselves, our own being (not only that of our children or the human race as we prefer, altruistically, to proclaim). The need for immortality is a need for being. Only love from a radical otherness can supply it, an otherness (a god or a fantasy) free of all that enchains us, free of narcissism, and able, hence, to love us, this mere fragment of being, this broken off piece of the real. The new generation lives on the edge between two attitudes ~ renewed participation and insertion into European and global history and ambivalence about and even radical refusal of the subjective limitations imposed by this history. Its interest in Western values, arrangements, and the role definitions of men and women is tempered by a discontent in and criticism of these arrangements. This generation is more interested in the psychic, than the historical. It wants to link the Estonian to its intrasubjective and corporeal experiences, to those irreducible interests and lived experiences of the body, sex, and death that make up one's core identity. In a sense, this new generation is producing a phenomenology of those lived experiences - pleasures, perversities, fears - that were only indirectly and partially recorded or had to be left unrecorded in the colonized past. It is interested in the phenomenological, not in the logical. This new generation is, on the one hand, more transnational, more global, more post-anthropomorphic, and, on the other hand, more interested in its own irreducible difference. It wants recognition of its specific identity, although it knows this identity to be unstable, transgressive, exploded, plural, and fluid. It seeks to comprehend its own specific trauma, which includes the more general trauma of being Nordic, i.e. the trauma of being cut off from the sun, of having to labor so hard, and endure so many colonizers etc. What the new Estonian subject wants, besides a more altered, less segregated, and honest account of sexuality, is the recognition of its eroticism as diffuse, subtle and rarefied, but inalienable and able to encompass love for the atom, the worm, and the stars. The initiation of a new subjectivity can only be founded upon the interiorization of the older subjectivity, not its destruction. Interiorization means detachment from the warring antitheses and polarities that were</page><page sequence="21">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 145 important to the older generation. It means a de-dramatization, a playing down, and disintegration of the polarities of master/slave, execu- tioner/victim, sadist/masochist, abuser/abused etc. to the point where they need no longer be acted out, or projected onto others. Interiorization obviates the destruction of the older subjectivity by inner preservation. Internalized, these dramas and polarizations that we once lived are not lost. They are accepted as true for each of us but they cease to be partitioned between ourselves and the other, ie. you are the executioner, I am the victim etc. Piiririik is a testimony to this de-dramatization. It is the want for a different kind of subjectivity to which a new relationship to time boundaries, and by extension, to all other psychic boundaries is of crucial importance. Piiririik calls for the re-evaluation of all boundary lines. It seeks a new and enlarged desiring space, both corporeal and psychic, which includes monumental time and a spirituality based on the real. Postmodern Magical Realism: Nordic-Baltic-Estonian Style Postmodern art and magical realism foreground the structures, properties, and laws of the unconscious. This is evident in the radical shifting of the planes of time, space, and identity in these works and the fact that these shifts produce the same sense of the drastic instability of the representation that we experience in the dream. Also, as in oneiric reality, we have unexpected metamorphoses and transformations; sudden, unexplained erasures or breaks in the representation; arbitrary juxtapositions; a lack of causation or causal explanation for actions or events; an absence of logical laws and chains: distinctions and categories that by the rules of logic are irreconcilable opposites are fused and intermingled. In postmodern works, the effort to make meanings and the excess of signification that marked modernism, as if in defense of the fear of the failure of signification, is abdicated. The seriousness of modernism that was concomitant with its desire for meaning is also deserted for play, trivialization, oblique references, sexual innuendoes, parody, and other such techniques that characterize the structure of the dream and the erotic strategies of the flesh far more than those of the mind. There is at best only an ambivalent, semi-seriousness that continually refreshes itself by dissolving everything into the dubious, the questionable, or the absurdly uncertain. In postmodern works, one frequently encounters a resistance to language as such, which exhibits itself in a new minimalism or miniatur- ization as well as a new mastery of condensation. The resistance is especially present in the seductions operative in these texts of silence,</page><page sequence="22">1 46 Maire Jaanus music, gesture, muteness, and death. The great realist and modernist faith in language, which lead to such linguistic luxuriance and excess in Proust and Joyce, is replaced in postmodernism by languagelessness or a stance that is anti-language. Language is merely the best tool for self-deception, lying, playing, or fiction. It can no longer take itself so seriously. Because they are aware of language acquisition as a fundamental mortification and castration, as a power bought with a sacrifice - the loss of the pleasure of our direct contact with things, with being, with each other - postmodernists are no longer invested in language in the absolute way that the nineteenth century and modernism was. Language is more a testimony to the absence of things than to their presence. Instead of the recognizable personal style prized by modernism, postmodernism offers stylistic hybridity and heterogeneity, and pastiche, and instead of modernist irony, we tend to have parody. Along with the diminution and questionability of language comes that of the significance and certainty of the speaking subject. It emerges as radically split and ever on the lookout for new means of self-fracture, self-dislocation, and self- disruption. Postmodernism construes identity as a play of projections, doublings, idealizations, and rejections. It sees identity as a makeshift, unstable construction put together from what is appropriated from others. The postmodern subject's tendency to paranoia connects to its fundamental emptiness and otherness, to its plagiaries and thefts from the other that it needs to constitute itself. De-narrativization, the neutralization of the narrative structures of modernism, and the enfeeblement of larger historical perspectives release within postmodernism a present charged with libidinal intensities. Fredric Jameson speaks of the reduction to the body, to uncodified intensities of sensations and images. Minute bodily events, curt sexual or sensual contacts, glimpses etc. and the brief, inconsequential minutiae of daily life are examined to answer the question what living really is, what reality is in the first and last place.33 Postmodernism often privileges what I have called the time of the drive over the time of the signifier. The time of the drive is the instant, the present, the now. It is the carnal moment of the senses and the pulsation of breath and blood, the genotextual moment, full of libidinal fire. In Piiririik, an avoidance and shifting of time and space planes begins on the first page with an omission (a resort to ellipses), a writing lapse that the nameless narrator immediately has when he should define the time and place of the event that he is describing: "That was, by the way, so long ago, in the past century, in a land that is lost" (5). The essential reference and orientation points of classical 19th century realism are either unavailable or not that relevant. His writing, the narrator tells us, is a type of raving as</page><page sequence="23">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 147 if in a dream which has somehow come true later, or which he has somehow made true, or which has been made true. Because of the seemingly oneiric origins of his text, he does not remember whether the time is yesterday or just now or five years ago (33). There are various possibilities, but it is not determinable which one is central. Thus, he does not know whether his encounter with Angelo was a random event, or whether Angelo selected him, or whether Angelo was sent to sound him out (6). The letters he writes are not the originals but mere summaries and translations of letters he never sends. And even the ones that he does send could be erased and disappear, just as happened with Franz. The act of writing and what is written are surrounded with uncertainty, hesitation, and the imminence of dissolution. It could all not be or it could be different. Everything he writes is suspect, equivocal, and merely an essay, provisional. Words are more like water than like building blocks. They are unreliable and inexact representations of that which occurred because the fact of the occurrence, the pregiven event itself, which is to be represented, cannot be ascertained.34 Did the event happen? "I am suddenly sure of nothing: is all of this true" (44)? And if something happened (or not), whose words represent the action more truthfully: the words printed in the newspaper (regarding Franz's suicide) or his own words in this text? The validity of what he writes cannot be guaranteed. Perhaps the entire geography he has just laid out textually is but an apparition, but maybe not. "Everything I tell you is the truth or at least as true as bank accounts and maps are" (13-4). Everything is a sketch, an outline, a representation, and not the thing itself. Is he on a sightseeing pleasure tour or in the underwater domain pushed there by a wave (13). Was he really on the train to Amsterdam (44)? Has he ever been there (35)? If something is past and there are no records, was it ever present? If he cannot determine where he is located now, how can he know where he was in the past? The reality his writing creates is undefined and uncertain. It is not definable because it cannot be clearly dissociated from his writing or separated from language. He is not even sure that he wants to write. There is a resistance to narration. Everyone wants to narrate their life, their "I," but he might prefer to listen, to get a rest from himself (22). He speaks only to fill up the silence which terrifies him. He feels he has little to say and he almost does not want to speak. From his effort, his voice grows weak towards the end, so that he has to point and gesture at the bakery to what he wants. At one point he will disappear and become invisible, the grass, which does not grow in a bakery, but elsewhere quietly by itself (147). As in a dream, the narrator feels split into a perceiver and the perceived. He is simultaneously actor and audience (18). Did he see those people out on the field from the train window, or was he himself there on</page><page sequence="24">1 4 8 Maire Jaanus the field on his knees, scarping the dusty earth with his fingernails and getting a sunstroke (44)? Is he the seer or the seen? Is he the subject or the object? To what extent are Angelo and he, or Franz and he, separate subjects (50)? He is disoriented because the subject-object divide is no longer fixed. The boundaries have loosened up and subjects and objects are interchangeable. The erasure of fundamental opposites, such as near and far, and other such founding polarities of realism produce strange dislocations, sensations, and hallucinations. Is Franz with him in the church in Amsterdam or is he, far away and very small, approaching him from a great distance over the gravestones, coming and coming for months and years (98)? As in oneiric reality, the narrator can come upon unexpected metamorphoses, transformations, and desires: blood-red roses that might be bought from an old woman may turn into a handful of frozen dirt (15).35 Lying under a linden tree and listening to rose petals fall could be happening to him in heaven (146). The smell of a decapitated human head in a refrigerator is an odor he may suddenly crave. The parodie setting of the crime is a clinically clean, impeccably functional kitchen, a holy place (where the refrigerator becomes the altar with its offering of delicious food), which inspires the narrator with fear, dread, and horror, and a violent desire to destroy everything. Murder emerges in some indistinct but primordial relationship to food, cannibalism, and survival, at once true and satiric. Breaks in reality and in the psyche might occur at any time and anywhere. The narrator cannot account for these any more than he can give reasons for why he is doing what he is doing. He has one (his earliest), certain memory of a piece of sky and pine tree tips beyond a shut window that he can call upon to prove that he existed (45). Besides that he is sure only of his inherence in his own sensation - the smell of the winter potatoes or the intense, sweet odor of black current bushes up there in the North (15-6). He is also sure, although he does not know where he is just now, that he is not "there," because "there" is where it is too light in June to see the stars (1 80). In Piiririik, we see the emergence or "outline" of a postmodern magical realism, Nordic-Baltic-Estonian style.</page><page sequence="25">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 149 Notes 1. For one's identification, some things are given to one: a name, which is a mark within a language designating a specific genealogical chain or descent; a nationality, which one shares in common with everyone in a particular geographic and/or linguistic area; an age and gender, which gives one an anthropological affinity with all others of this age and gender in the world. The anthropological categories reach out beyond national boundaries, as do often the religious, linguistic, and professional designations, ie. I have a commonness with all the lawyers of the world. None of this really addresses one's radical singularity which is really finally given to one by the unconscious. Yet, there is a tremendous support in these symbolic marks and in being able to say: I am Estonian or French, a student or a lawyer, a mother or a descendent of someone. 1 am this and not that. These symbolic denominations, though general, are a support against dissolution, and therefore worth fighting for. They are as if the container, the vase, that can be filled differently, but that continue to exist. The libido reaches out and snatches at this and that, enjoying itself with fragments from our multi-cultural, multi-racial, and multinational world but then there is always also the container, the idem to return to. Notably, the author plays with identity, or has, as a translator (traitor, transmitter), already translated his own name into a pseudonym, ie. transferred, carried it across a linguistic border from Estonia (Tõnu Õnnepalu) to France (Rousseau's Émile , and Germany's Tod meaning death, but in Estonian "tõde" is verity.). He has left his nation for Paris and never directly names his place of origin, creating uncertainty thereby about the legacies that give him his legal, national, and linguistic identity. The words Estonia or Estonian, never occur. It is always "Eastern Europe" or "the land from which I come," or "from the North up there" etc. (6, 10, 181). Thus, the place is generalized and broadened to be more inclusive of a larger part of Europe. Of course, anyone reading the original Estonian text would read it as a reference foremost to Estonia. 2.

Piir means border, boundary, frontier, threshold, limit, end, terminus, line, borderline. Riik is a state, body politic, nation, country, community, kingdom, domain, realm, empire, government. Piiririik has been translated into French (Gallimard), German (Carl Hausser), Spanish (Tusquets), Italian (Iperborea), Dutch (Meulenhoff), Danish (Munksgaard-Rosinante), Swedish (Waldström &amp; Widstrand), Norwegian (Cappelen Englefrö), Finnish (Otava Enbelden Siemen), Latvian (Robezvalsts), and into Lithuanian and Russian. 4.

"And if you happen to be standing on the border, then you are not visible, not from either side" (181). And no one in Franz's apartment house ever saw the narrator and he never saw anyone either. See Václav Havel in "The Hope for Europe," calling on Europe to live up to its vision and commitment to a united European Union by including everyone. The New York Review of Books (June 20, 1996), 38-41. 12. Franz selected him because he could find no other victim to impress with his obsolete subjectivity. Only an Eastern European, oriented in the 19th century, is still interested in philosophy as such and able to listen to his moralizing and his outmoded ideas about insurgence and the dismantling of society (40-41). Franz, the European master, is, in fact, intellectually, emotionally, and sexually bankrupt. He lacks erotic force and drive. Mainly, he would like to have his penis held while eating spaghetti, but he is afraid to ask (99). 13. In the church in Amsterdam, he is as if poised between death (the floor of the church is all gravestones) and eternal life (the roof is similar to an upside down ship bottom) (97-8). 14. Julia Kristeva, "Women's Time," The Kristeva Reader , ed. Toril Moi (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986), 188-213. This entire section of the paper draws on Kristeva' s ideas and adapts them to the situation in Estonia. 15. From our obsessionality it follows that we have developed sophisticated mechanisms for the control of time. With data processing we can now record and store time, and make it re-emerge according to demand. Time itself has come to be commodified, and the one who controls the recordings of time and the origins of programming can manipulate, organize, and sell it as s/he pleases. 16. War is above all what his grandmother fears (92) and being sent to Siberia (91). More than anything, the narrator fears to be stuck somewhere from which there is no escape (112). The fears are obviously interrelated. Whenever the narrator encounters a space that feels confining (such as the fish tank-mausoleum in which the seminar of Eastern European translators is being conducted), or a glass that reminds him of his grandmother's shut and taboo window, he wants to smash and shatter it (51). 17. It is because we are becoming less and less capable of remembering that deception becomes more and more necessary every day. Dissimulation has to take on bolder and more radical forms to compel people to believe that they exist, that they have and will exist, and that their existence is important or</page><page sequence="27">Estonia's Time and Monumental Time 1 5 1 necessary. The narrator loves those who deceive, cheat, and trick - impostors like Angelo, who is a coffee expert, although he knows nothing about coffee, but whose declarations determine which village in Latin America will bloom and which will be struck by starvation (157-8). A writer similarly cannot know the good or evil consequences of his work. 18. Modifying a Nietzschean thesis from The Genealogy of Morals , the narrator declares that all those who cannot act or be part of the historical mainstream, who are not the masters, as the Eastern Europeans are not, can assert themselves only by acts of criminality. Crime is rampant because the destructive drives of the slaves no longer have other outlets: there are no elephants or natives to shoot or hunt down, no foreign temples or villages to rob and burn (37). The end of the age of imperialism forces all (excepting those few who dominate the rest) to destroy themselves or each other. 19. By contrast, Franz cannot and will not talk about the death drive; that is his boundary. The narrator crosses it by suggesting that Franz must enjoy the idea that one day the planes, built by the company in which he owes shares, will bomb everything to mush. Given Franz's denial of the sadistic-aggressive drive, it is ironically appropriate that the paper reports his murder as a "self-murder." Killing oneself happened, in any case, among journalists, to be the preferred and more interesting form of self-destruction that week because a highly placed politician had just done it (159). 20. Bombs are in any case part of his inheritance. His grandmother's farm was bombed during World War II and all her relatives died, and she went insane, the cure for which, a doctor told her, is to walk against a cool breeze. That helps, as the narrator knows, because he does it too (92). The remedy is homeopathic: more of the same; as a Nordic he needs more coolness. 21 . In a dream he sees himself as a boy grinning in his coffin, with no respect for anything, not even mortality, for whom nothing is serious and whose perverse nonseriousness and scoffing at death can no longer be covered up, or mastered or controlled, and who, finally, escapes his coffin (32). 22.

Richard Feldstein, Bruce Fink, &amp; Maire Jaanus (New York: SUNY Press, 1995), 121-4 et passim. 23. In relation to the above points see Colette Soler' s discussion of the distinction between alienation and separation, on which I draw, in "The Subject and the Other (II)" in Reading Seminar XI, 50-3 et passim. 24. He avoids encounters with other poor, pathetic Eastern Europeans (42-3). No matter what they wear, their clothes always betray them, as his betray him (55). To avoid being pitied, in the way Eastern Europeans are, and addressed in the way one addresses the relative of a dead person, he claims to be Swedish (85). 25. For a further discussion of the hatred of the other see my "'A Civilization of Hatred': The Other in the Imaginary," in Richard Feldstein, Bruce Fink, &amp; Maire Jaanus eds., Reading Seminars I and II: Lacan 's Return to Freud (New York: SUNY Press, 1996), 323-355.</page><page sequence="28">152 Maire Jaanus 26.

In "Literature in a Global Society" ( PMLA , 1990:395-401), Betty Jean Craige argues that if global culture is anything like a healthy ecosystem, its well-being depends on diversity and the healthy interaction of its constituents. Cultural diversity is as natural as bio-diversity and must similarly be recognized as valuable to the functioning of the whole. Further, since the parts of the whole interact, its health requires the well-being of all its components. Intermingling, her argument goes, will not lead to global sameness. It should lead, as an ecosystem does, to new varieties. To fear worldwide cultural homogeneity is, therefore, dangerous just as hoping to regain an imagined, lost cultural purity is because the attempt to preserve a particular cultural or genetic order in a world of continuous change leads inevitably to conflict. The goal is mainly to intermingle peacefully. What this argument overlooks is the differences between natural and cultural systems, the difference, for one, of language and the symbolic by means of which a cultural system is able to control and manipulate the speed and degree of its changes, if it wishes to. Secondly, what this argument evades is the issue of the amount and degree of intermingling and interaction. How much otherness is tolerable before what was before disappears completely? Do the new varieties come into existence at the expense and loss of the old? Finally, the argument also ignores the psychic structure of humans. If humans tend to fear change so much, if it has so traumatic an effect, even when desired, this means something. Have we not as a species always been invested at least as much in the unchanging as in change? 33. Fredric Jameson, Signatures of the Visible (New York: Routlege, 1990), 148-152 et passim. 34. Jameson speaks of the present as "a moment in the evolution of the philosophical vocation of narrative.. .which can be described as the foregrounding, exploration, subversion, or modification of the category of the Event in general." Ibid., 148. 35. In Gabriel García Márques or Salman Rushdie, such moments of color proliferate, rather than disappear, into showers of color and uncountable numbers of flowers. Scarcity and economy in libidinal intensity rather than excess is one of the differences between Nordic and other styles of magical realism.</page></plain_text>
