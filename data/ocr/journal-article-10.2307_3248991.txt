Introduction, notes, index, index of Chinese na- mes. The Ronald Press, New York. I 96. $ o o.o. This work is the third major book on the subject of Chinese jade written by Alfred Salmony, late Pro- fessor Emeritus at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. The first, Carved Jade of Ancient China, published in I938, was the first authoritative attempt to present a logical art history of decorated jades from the earliest times down to the Han dynasty. Since this was written twenty-five years ago, it was only to be expected that it contained some errors which Professor Salmony himself later recognized. Nevertheless, in that work, Salmony set out to cor- rect some of the misconceptions in the stylistic as- sessment and attributions of early jades held before I938. Undoubtedly this was a major step forward. In the late 1940's the reviewer suggested to Alfred Salmony that his first book should be revised for a new edition, but the author said he preferred instead to write an entirely new work, embracing all periods. First he had to complete the catalogue of the Sonnen- schein collection, begun in 194I. This was published in I952 under the title Archaic Chinese Jades from the Edward and Louise B. Sonnenschein Collection. Limited by the scope of this collection as a unit - there was, for example, no chapter on pre-Shang jades - this work, although important and well produced, did not offer Salmony the opportunity of writing the com- prehensive work he had in mind. As he pointed out, the main difference between his first book and the I952 Sonnenschein study was that the latter was not limited to carved jades, but included undecorated ones as well, objects which could not be dated by comparison of ornamentation. Alfred Salmony's third book on jades was planned as two volumes covering all periods. The final chapter on the Wei period, which completed the first volume, was finished in the spring of I958. This chapter he carried with him on his journey to Europe. His health made the intended visit hazardous, but Salmony courageously pursued his object, embarking on the sea voyage to fulfill his plans for further work. Alas, he did not survive the journey; and the manuscript returned to New York. The editing of the work was in due course offered to the present reviewer, but the task was too complicated to be undertaken single- handed on a part-time basis in Europe, far away from so much of the material and from the documents to which access was essential for checking the extensive notes and other details. This arduous task was taken on by Miss Florance Waterbury, assisted by others mentioned by Professor Craig Hugh Smyth, Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, in the Foreword to the book. Incidentally, the Foreword gives the date of publication of Archaic Chinese Jades as I953, whereas this should be I952; an error re- peated also in Note 2 of the author's Introduction. The question arose whether the finished manuscript, carrying through the Wei period, should be aug- mented to include chapters on Sui and T'ang, for which there was no text but only some explanatory notes to some plates for jades attributed to the Sui dynasty. It was finally decided, wisely, to publish only what the author had written and completed him- self. Thus, the title originally planned to be "Chinese Jades of all Periods", was posthumously altered to Chinese Jade through the Wei Dynasty. The contents comprise an Introduction, followed by separate chapters for Pre-Anyang, Shang, Early Western Chou, Middle Chou, Late Eastern Chou, Han, and Wei; followed by a general Index and an Index of Chinese Names. Very extensive notes follow every chapter. The format of this book is smaller than the two earlier jade publications, and the arrangement of text and plates is different. The plates, always an im- portant part of any book on jade, do not give quite the same impression one has come to associate with Salmony's previous works. The smaller page with its narrower border tends to an apparent if not actual lessening of space, which is accentuated by a black border around every plate which was not used in the 333</page><page sequence="2">previous books. In the earlier publications the plates and their descriptions could be clearly read side by side at one opening; not so in the new book, where descriptions are frequently separated from the plates and where the text is interspersed between both the descriptions and the plates. This arrangement makes it necessary to turn hither and thither to follow both text and plate descriptions. For example, the text on page 39 is continued on the lower half of page I49; having turned several pages to read that half-page, it is necessary once more to turn to the bottom of page I54 for only three more short sentences which are continued on page 1 55, after which it is necessary to turn to page I 59, and so on. As usual in the case of Professor Salmony's books, the photographs from which the illustrations were prepared are generally of a high standard. The major- ity of the reproductions are therefore good, although some objects have come out less clearly than the photographs, or have been reproduced on a smaller scale; the paper surface of the plates is matt, compared with the finer surface selected for those of the earlier books. Since many plates show several objects, some with light and others with black backgrounds on the same plate, an impression of more room might have been given by dispensing with the black border. This book, to quote the author, endeavours "to re- place arbitrary or intuitive attributions by controllable ones, and to lay a firm groundwork for a complete and substantiated jade chronology." There can be no doubt that the aims of the author are based on logical reasoning qualified by the limitations necessarily im- posed by the state of our knowledge of archaeological evidence to-day, and in this sense he has succeeded in laying a valuable groundwork. How firm the ground- work will prove to be for a "complete and substan- tiated jade chronology", only the passage of time can tell. Since, as the author states, with certain exceptions most Chinese jades have not received the benefit of controlled and datable excavations - vast areas are as yet still unexplored by the archaeological field work- er - it is bound to take a very long time, extending into the unforseeable future, to obtain an established succession of jade art phases based on irrefutable evidence. Therefore, Salmony has adopted the fa- miliar method of comparing certain jades with other Chinese post-Han art objects in other media which are more easily datable; a method which, although beset with uncertainty and controversy, has been suc- cessfully employed for the pre-Han groups and for other works of art in different fields. The author says that he does not pretend to solve every question arising from the choice of this method of stylistic analysis, and stresses repeatedly that he offers only a working hypothesis. It is therefore necessary to bear this proviso in mind in forming any critical judgment of the book at the present time. Alternative opinions on some of the more controversial aspects of dating may be held by different scholars, but in any con- sidered judgment experience and connoisseurship must command respect. Alfred Salmony possessed these qualities to a high degree. The chapter on Pre-Anyang material groups three pre-Anyang phases as one, owing to the small number of jades which can be attributed to this early period. Nine jades and one stone object are illustrated. The author discusses pre-Anyang material in general, in- cluding reference to some early Chinese jade adzes and axes found in the Philippine Islands which have no native source of jade and are suggested as imports begun during the Neolithic phase of the Islands. The excavations by Okladnikov of prehistoric graves at Glaskov and elsewhere, revealing jade discs, are con- sidered supporting evidence for the existence of similar objects in pre-Anyang China in the North. Although no prehistoric jade has been discovered below the Yangtze, to the knowledge of the author, a large irregular triangular blade is illustrated as sug- gesting a Southern Chinese origin, (P1.i-I) on ac- count of resemblance to certain stone implements from S. China and S.E. Asia. The very large size of this object might be overlooked in the plate where it is reproduced only slightly larger than a juxtaposed pendant 25/8" high and Ix/2" wide. The blade is actually I73/s" wide and 3 I/2" high. A crudely formed and engraved fish, similar in outline to some Shang types with a chisel-tail, is attributed to the same early period, the crude carving being considered in- dicative of a pre-Anyang date (P1. I. 3 a and b). The so-called lozenges on the sides (pl. 3 a) seem strangely crude compared with the better executed Shang-type lozenges, incised with a double outline, on the back of the same fish. A similar example of both crude and accomplished decoration in the same object is seen in an anthropomorphic silhouette, attributed to Early Western Chou. (PI. XII. 2), where a cross and circle are carved less carefully. The pre-Anyang attribution of the fish is made on the basis of the crude carving of its head frame, eyes and mouth together with a Pa- 334</page><page sequence="3">of technique between Shang and Early Chou are also discussed. Included in the Early Western Chou chapter are some fine examples of stag and cervid heads from the Erickson collection (P1. XI. 3,4), now at Stockholm, and two equally fine quality anthropomorphic figures from the Musee Cernuschi and Freer Gallery of Art (PI. XII. 3,6). Here, once again, it is necessary care- fully to compare the sizes of the objects on the plate with the real measurements, for accuracy and proper perspective. Several objects, two or three inches high, are reproduced almost the same size as or larger than the Cernuschi jade (P1. XII. 3), which is given as 83/I6 high but only I" wide; or is 83/16" an error for 33/I6 "? For jades of the Middle Chou group the author bases the chronology on the classification of bronzes origi- nated by the work of Professor Karlgren, and lists numerous well-studied stylistic characteristics for the period. Typical for Middle Chou is the incised handle, reproduced by a rubbing, on P1. XIII. 2. Atypical is the Earth symbol ts'ung (P1. XIII. I), which is like no other known accepted early example. No Middle Chou jade figure in the round has so far been identi- fied, which is explained by the author as due to the lack of interest in relief sculpture at that period. The applique illustrated on P1. XIV. 5, now in Stockholm, has recently been reported as being not made of jade, as described, but of a softer material resembling soapstone; this does not, of course, affect the attri- bution. Professor Salmony passes from Middle Chou to Late Eastern Chou, including in the latter stylistic category the few years of Ch'in rule, which were too brief for development of a distinctive style. As the book under review was completed in I 958, it was not possible to refer to the I959 report by the Academia Sinica of archaeological excavations of the cemetery of the State of Kuo, at Shang Ts'un Ling, Honan province, conducted during 195 6-7. This discovery was of im- portance because the rich finds, all belonging to the one and the same State of Kuo, are datable before 65 5 B. C., the cemetery being attributed to the period between Late Western and Early Eastern Chou, a period which until now has been a blank in Chinese archaeology, including that of jade. This important excavation revealed that certain jade split-disc de- corated ornaments called chuieh were usually found in pairs, close to the ears of the cadavers. In some cases a necklace of carnelian beads, interspersed with ap- laeolithic symbolism (p. I7). The Note 24 referring to the author's Carved Jade, Pl.XIX-2, which shows a Shang fish of different type, and to his Archaic Chinese Jades Pls. XLII-XLV, throws no apparent additional light on the pre-Anyang aspect of dating this jade fish although it does, in the latter reference, illustrate Early Western Chou fishes which have short legs with feet under the head, a feature which ap- pears to be present in a vestigial or worn-away form on the one illustrated here (although not mentioned by the author, who nevertheless recognizes a less obvious example in his book Archaic Chinese Jades, PI.XT,TTT-i and p. 75). Again, of the "two objects which combine the aquatic animal and the lozenge" referred to as analogous, one at least can hardly be described primarily as "aquatic" (pp. I7-1I8) to judge by the author's description. The Shang chapter covers familiar ground. Many types are illustrated which are established by archae- ological evidence; one exception mentioned, but not illustrated by an example, is the jade arrowhead. The dagger axe on P1.IV.I, now on view at the new Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities at Stockholm, is atypical in the manner in which two perpendicularly incised lateral lines converge to the point of the blade, a rather unusual manner of Shang blade decoration which some authorities might consider a later em- bellishment. It is not always possible to know pre- cisely the use to which some Shang jade objects of material culture were put. In a very few instances re- cent excavations have clarified former misconcep- tions. A good example of this, illustrated in the book (P1. V. 5 and p. 43), is the type of Shang animal head on a notched and tapering body. Formerly called "knot-openers" or "toggles", they are now more certainly known to have been used for the end of a bow. In describing certain jade animal silhouettes of Shang and Early Chou, Salmony repeats the commonly made error of referring to the "rabbit"; (p. 70); the rabbit was not indigenous to China, the animal de- picted on early jades being the hare. Another minor error of description is present for the Shang bird on P1.VIII.2, which does not have a small perforation in the tail. The dual orientation of unmodified Shang jade styl- istic trends into Early Western Chou, together with others of marked differentiation, is well described, three groups of excavated jades being taken as a basis for general conclusions; some technical modifications 335</page><page sequence="4">parently jade ones of a distinctive shape, were worn around the neck (Report No. 3. 1959. Pls. XXTX. 1-4; XXVI. i and XLII.I; and front colour plates , i and III). The Late Eastern Chou chapter describes fully the documentation for jades of this period and illustrates many fine examples, including personal ornaments, human figures, garment hooks, sword fittings and two vessels. The ts'ung is omitted, plain examples of which were included in the author's previous book. Included is a remarkable belt-hook and hanging pendant, cut from one block (P1. XVIII. I). The text (p. 115) refers to the material of this piece as being "not as hard as that of some other pieces", without giving any further explanation as to whether or not the material has been subjected to a scientific test for material identification, such as diffraction X-ray ex- amination. The winged lion on P1. XXV. 3 assigned "with some hesitation to the end of the period", might be placed by some authorities as a little later. It is a matter of opinion whether the Late Chou coiled bronze tiger illustrated in the Venice Exhibition, 1954, Cat. No. 97 offers a valid parallel for the striated mane covering the head and neck of the winged lion - personally, the reviewer would incline to the view that it does not - but certainly the formation of the ears, which Salmony terms "pitted" on the lion does not appear to be of the same style as those on the bronze, the latter ap- pearing to be of the type formed by a continuation of the ruff into terminal spirals (p. i66 and Note 56). It is true that a sort of pit is formed in both kinds of ears, but they are not parallels in a stylistic sense. The author also fails to make a similar distinction in con- nection with a jade bear in the Han chapter, which will be referred to later. A pointed blade on P1.XV. I, notwithstanding the well modelled spirals, has a tectonic style rather more suggestive of an archaizing piece of a much later period. Some scabbard buckles, similar to the one on P1. XVI. 5 would be considered by some as early Han. The Han period is well covered, opening with re- productions of some flat jades from Noin-ula and Irkutsk, followed by several vessels, some of which require handling before formative impressions can be gained. Since Han attributions for vessels are based entirely on the quality of the material and style of de- coration, the author rightly stresses the need for cau- tion, and one can follow his reasoning that "in copy- ing Han objects the Sung artists were never able to reproduce the flavour of Late Eastern Chou as closely as the Han carvers, who were prolonging a tradi- tion." In the Wei chapter (p. 234) the author puts forward the theory that the Wei jade artists, also, revived the Late Eastern Chou style, basing this revival after 220 A.D. on the discovery of a single jade ring re- cently unearthed from a grave near Nanking. If this theory is acceptable, the attribution of certain vessels with a Late Chou flavour to Han, Wei, or Sung will become even more difficult. In discussing a Han relief depicting a bird staff beside an old man (p.I 93) the reader is referred to an ex- ample in the book belonging to the subsequent period, namely P1. XXXTX. 3; but the object which the latter plate depicts is a jade horn. The intended object for reference may be the bird finial shown on PI. XL. 3. A head of a bird in the round, from the Erickson collection (P1. XXXT. I), now at Stockholm, may perhaps be even pre-Han, if one may judge from the sculptural form, decoration and material. A female dancer plaque (P1.XXXV.I) of creamy white and green jade, on loan to the Victoria and Albert Mu- seum, London, demonstrates the transition from Late Eastern Chou to Han, possessing stylistic details from both periods. The attribution of the human figure, No. 3 on the same plate, would, however, seem to be controversial as its precise period and even authen- ticity are at present under review by Mr. William Trousdale, of the Freer Gallery of Art. Of consider- able interest are Nos.4 and 5, horned anthropomor- phic seated figures, which are the only examples of this type recorded. The block-like bear, shown on P1. XXXTV. 2, is typi- cally Han, but the analogy of the ear formation with the "pitted cylinder" ears of animals on P1. XXV. I and 3 is difficult to follow as a satisfactory stylistic parallel. The characteristically early Han feature of the bear, where the kind of ruff is continued into ears as terminating spirals, could have been compared more closely with more acceptable parallels, such as the similar combined ruff and coiled-ear formation on a bronze belt-hook in the British Museum [Watson: Ancient Chinese Bronzes I962, P1. 80 (b)]; the small re- production of this jade is less clear than the larger original photograph, so that the centre head fissure described is not visible, nor, without a lens, are some finely striated details. A turtle, less than half the size, is reproduced disproportionately magnified on the same plate although there are no fine hatchings to 336</page><page sequence="5">demonstrate. The advice to use a lens for examining the plates, made by the author in his first book "Car- ved Jade", might have been usefully repeated in the present book. The Wei chapter, terminating the book, is an in- novation, being the first serious attempt to establish, in book form, a complete chapter with numerous ex- amples attributed to this period. The author states that in view of the paucity of archaeological evidence there is no literature on the style of Wei jade. This observation was correct when it was written, but since then two monographs have been published in the Transactions of the Oriental Ceramic Society, London, which do include studies of certain jades attributed to this period (T.O.C.S. vol. 3I, I957-9; and vol. 33, I96I-2). Precisely because of the paucity of archae- ological evidence for Wei jades it is important not merely to attribute jades to the period but to attempt to explain clearly the basis of the attributions and, if there is room to do so, to illustrate, side by side, a few analogies in other media in order to indicate particular details of style; also to show why an alter- native dating is less likely by illustrating or explaining such alternative stylistic differences. While there is no reason to doubt that in the majority of cases Sal- mony has given good reasons for a Wei attribution, his treatment of the differential analytical diagnosis between Wei style and, for example, Sung, in some vessel types which are illustrated, is somewhat less than is needed for a serious work of this nature which, in the author's own words, aims to "replace arbitrary or intuitive attributions by controllable ones". It is, of course, possible, that a more detailed comparison be- tween the Late Chou jade style and the influence of that style in Wei and Sung times might have been expounded by the author in the Sung chapter, had that been written. Certain minor inaccuracies of description and other errors, one or two of which were corrected by dis- tributing errata slips after publication of the book had already taken place, might also have been avoided had the author's health been better and had he lived to correct the proofs. For example, the objects Nos. 2 and 3 on P1.XLII have been transposed; having made this correction the reference to "P1. XXXTTT. 2", referring to a camel, in the plate description of XLII. 3, should have been to XLII. 2, a winged lion. Also, in the description of P1. XLII. 3, the word "stroked" appearing twice, should be "striated"; while the striated raised markings on the spine behind the middle of the body are not actually "undercut". On the same plate No. i, depicting a Wei chimera holding a cup in its mouth, the only perforation through which liquid can be poured into the cup is through the mouth and not also through the nostrils, the per- forations of the latter being only partial. The right flank of this animal bears not merely a "zig-zag", but the partly worn away vestige of a three petalled flower of the same pattern as that on the left flank. A detailed study of this jade by the reviewer was published in the Transactions of the O.C.S. vol. I, I957-9. On the same Plate XLII. corrected, No. 2, the winged lion is stated to bear an inscription on the under side which Salmony - who admitted to the reviewer that he could not interpret it - assumed to be later than the object. Miss Hsio-yen Shih, of the Far Eastern Department of the Royal Ontario Museum, who examined this jade and its inscription in late I962, gave cogent reasons for the inscription, which is in li K'ai form, being more likely to have been used from the 2nd to 4th century A.D., than in the 5th century or later; a view which Miss Shih has since confirmed. This opinion would seem to be in line with Professor Salmony's last minute uncertainty whether this winged lion was Han or Wei. He had first put it in the Han chapter, but finally placed it in Wei. This necessitated re-arranging several plates, which may have caused the errors in numbering and cross-refer- ences. In certain cases there is something to be said for a less restricted dating, such as "Late Han or Early Wei", a form of attribution not used in the book. Further transposing of the Wei plate numbers seems to have accurred on P1. XLI. Nos. 3 and 5, if one may judge by comparing the descriptions with the animals illustrated. While one can follow the reasoning for attributing certain of the animal and other jades to the Wei period when these can be explained by comparison with more certainly datable analogies in stone, bronze or other media, one would like to have reasons to explain the Wei attribution of such pieces as the lion and cub, of P1. XLIV. I in which both the composi- tion and the extreme cubism are "without parallel in Wei sculpture". It would be useful, also, to be told where to find a Wei parallel for the sharp three- pointed pattern on the cheek-wing of the animal de- picted on P1. XT TTT. I, a type of decoration seen also on the sides of dragon-heads of late T'ang and later date. Perhaps the most surprising part of the Wei chapter is that devoted to the cups, on Plates XXXVII to 337</page><page sequence="6">XXXIX. The libation vessel on PI. XXXVII. I is de- scribed as being of the same shape and period as one in the Venice Exhibition (No.225), except that the latter has a lung handle instead of a ring handle. The reviewer would place the latter cup, from his own collection, certainly as post-Wei and therefore by im- plication also the one illustrated here. Many readers may feel the need for a more analytical differential diagnosis between Wei and Sung styles before ac- cepting without a question-mark the firm Wei dating given for cups 2 and 3 on the same plate. In a different category are the cylindrical cups shown on Plates XXXVIII-IX. None has a lid or masked feet as on the Late Eastern Chou prototype in the Freer Gallery of Art (W. Watson: China before the Han Dynasty, 1 96, pi. 63; but not specifically "from Chin- ts'un", as stated there; only a marked similarity to other jades ascribed to this locality). That on Plate XXXVIII closely resembles the Craig cup, formerly in the Hom- berg collection (London Exhibition 9535-6, No. 681, andO.C.S. SungExhibition, Ig60, No. 264),exceptthat on the latter example, which most authorities would date as Sung, or perhaps late T'ang, the animal feet are somewhat different. The base underneath the Craig cup is decorated with a very dissolved scroll decor, with terminal fur hatchings, a type of decora- tion which the reviewer has noticed underneath two jade chimera-like animals which have been considered as of T'ang or Early Sung date (Stockholm I963, Nos. I36 and 146). No mention of any decoration on the base is made for the Junkunc vessel illustrated on P1. XXXVIII, and unfortunately Miss Florance Water- bury was unable to provide this information which the reviewer was interested to have at the time of the Sung Exhibition in London in 1960. Salmony bases his Wei date for the Junkunc vessel on P1. XXXVIII on the analogy between one of the supporting feet in the shape of a lion, with stone and bronze examples of the 6th century, although he forewarns the reader that the dating of this group of cups may cause sur- prise. It is perhaps too soon to add any constructive com- ments on the author's dating of this group of cylindri- cal cups, to which must be added yet another of similar type recently exhibited in the Stockholm Jade Exhibition (No.II3) which was considered by au- thorities whose opinions were consulted during the Exhibition, to be not much earlier than Sung. The group offers an interesting field for further research. The flattened bird coiffure ornament, attributed by Salmony to Wei on P1. XL. 5, is placed by Dr.Gyl- lensvaird and by the reviewer in the second half of the T'ang period, and was so attributed at Stockholm. On the same plate, No. i, the fine bird-vessel from the collection of H.M. The King of Sweden pos- sesses four very delicately rendered incised circles on the cheek, a form of decoration seen on some other Han/Wei early jade animals, but these are not men- tioned in the description or seen in the rather in- different reproduction. In fairness, it must be said that this decoration is difficult to see and had passed unnoticed until just before the Stockholm Exhibition and later demonstrated by the reviewer on a carefully prepared coloured slide. This book is a stimulating contribution to the study of a difficult subject fraught with problems the solu- tions of which are sometimes necessarily controver- sial, as the author fully recognized. When jades of the intermediate periods do not have the benefit of sup- porting archaeological evidence, one has the choice either of refraining from attributions until the un- foreseeable future, in the hope that one day the Chin- ese archaeological teams may solve these problems for us - and in that case one should logically also refrain from exhibiting such objects with attributions - or, on the other hand, one may publish the results of many years of intensive research and leave for pos- terity some record of the conclusions arrived at, to be used as a tentative working hypothesis in the mean- time. Professor Salmony took the latter course, in preference to the negative attitude of doing nothing to stimulate and contribute to our present knowledge of the subject. For this reason and as a published re- cord of his lines of research, this book must be wel- comed. While giving well-deserved credit to the author's vast knowledge and grasp of the subject, the unequivocal dating of a few of the more controversial pieces in this book within definite dynastic periods, without allowing for possible alternative attributions, may tend to give some readers, less experienced than the author, a misleading impression. It is hoped that a second edition will be needed, in which the various necessary amendments and cor- rections can be made, perhaps with the addition of a chronological table for the periods covered by the book. Postscript (September I964) Since the foregoing was written (Autumn i963) fur- ther information relating to two objects in the book has just been brought to my notice. 338</page><page sequence="7">Mr. William Trousdale has kindly informed me that the "Horse and rider" statuette on P1. XXXTTT-4 is marble and not jade. Sir Aurel Stein first published a description of this piece, when he believed it to be mar- ble. The laboratory of the National Museum in New Delhi tested this piece for Mr. Trousdale in October I963 and the material is marble, not jade. The question therefore arises as to whether, having regard to its material, the crude carving and its find location, this particular object is really representative of the main stream of Chinese jade work in the Han period; or whether, as Mr. Trousdale suggests, it properly be- longs more to nomadic work of Central Asian tra- ditions. Mr. Fritz Low-Beer has also been good enough to advise me that, from his personal knowledge, the de- scription of the belt hook from the Mayer collection on P1. XVIII-i, formerly in the Minkenhof collection, errs in one important respect; the gilt body enclosing the jade plaque is not wood, as described, but metal, presumably silver. This has now been confirmed by Mr. Mayer. Such a belt hook with wooden settings for jade and other precious stones would, of course, be most unusual although not, one supposes, impos- sible. As the gilded frame is silver, it would appear to the reviewer that it may have affinities with a group, of which the gold framed and jade inset belt hook from the Winthrop collection in the Fogg Art Museum, and the gilded silver framed and jade inset one, exca- vated at Ku-wei-t'sun, Hui-hsien in I95o2, are out- standing examples.

Crawford, Jr. New York: Pierpont Morgan Library, 19 62, 302 pp. rI reproductions*. $ roo.oo. This sumptuous and well made book is the third major catalog of a private Occidental collection of Chinese painting to be published in modern times. It was preceded by Early Chinese Paintings from the A. W. Bahr Collection, by O.Siren (London, I938) and by A Study of Chinese Painting in the Collection of Ada * I am obviously and deeply indebted to my colleague, Wai-kam Ho, for his major assistance in giving all Sinological information, including translations of texts and seals as well as Chinese references. Small Moore by Louise Hackney and C.F. Yau (Ox- ford, I940). The Bahr paintings can now be studied at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Moore paintings at the Yale University Art Gallery. Mr. Crawford's have been on display at the Morgan Library, New York, the Fogg Art Museum, Cam- bridge, and at the Nelson Art Gallery, Kansas City. By studying the three publications in sequence and by examining the original paintings within a decent interval, one can come to reasonably certain con- clusions that the study of Chinese painting has indeed "progressed", that the standards of quality, authen- ticity and judgment have become more subtle and complex, but that any synoptic collection formed in a relatively short period by close contact with any given segment of the market in Chinese art is certain to contain a more mixed bag than a collection formed over a longer period by selection from all possible sources. The Crawford collection has indeed more masterpieces, a wider scope and better documented material than any other private Western collection since the pioneer one of Charles L. Freer; but one wishes that it had the standard of selectivity and quality of, say, the collection at Kansas City, or a less synoptic intent in keeping with the available resources of the art market in the nineteen-fifties as opposed to the twenties and thirties. But we can document these reservations when we come to the catalog proper. If one were to characterize the Bahr, Moore, and Crawford catalogs in a progressive sequence, the sum- mary descriptions would be like this. The Bahr book is fundamentally a Western art historical compilation. Descriptions of the pictures, a few comparisons, seals described sparingly and accepted more or less at face value, little if any attention to inscriptions, colophons, and almost none to Chinese historical records and literature. Chinese words are given in romanized form, no Chinese characters are used, either in text or in index. References to "Sung silk," "Yiian paper" occur, needless to say without documentation or sup- port. Siren's selection of twenty-five paintings from the ones available was discreet, but it reflected the composition of the collection. Numerous early, pre- Sung type landscapes of a character remotely sug- gesting the European Gothic or Early Renaissance occur in the selection. In contrast to the interest in "primitives" is a comparative lack of interest in big names; aesthetic appeal seems to have been dominant, though it must be admitted that Siren wisely sup- pressed some ambitious attributions.
