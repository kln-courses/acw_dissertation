<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eclectic Review, 1805-1868 &amp; 0 $ Mary Ruth Hiller Eclectic Review vus established in 1805 by a group of "public-spirited gendemen" who wished to "rouse the Christian world to a perception of the important influence which literature possesses in obstructing or in accelerat ing the progress of religious truth and human happiness."1 The founders of the Review hoped to create a journal that could be supported by Dissenters and members of the Establishment alike ? hence their choice of title ? The Eclectic Review. They aimed to "select the best from every philosophical class ? seek Truth amongst all wrangling Sects or schools"; their objective was "public utility ? utility of the highest kind ? the advancement of general happiness, by the establishment of just principles of conduct" which was the "most important purpose for which Literature" could be employed.2 The masthead of the review proclaimed in the original Greek the very essence of the Eclectic philosophy, quoting an early Christian father, Clement of Alex andria, "And I do not define philosophy as the Stoic one, nor the Platonic, nor the Epicurean and Aristotelian; but rather as many things teaching jus tice with holy enquiry as are well said in each of these schools; this taken as a whole, the Eclectic, I call philosophy." Funds for the new review were raised by concerned Protestants like the banker William Alers Hankey, who was also a founder of the British and For eign Bible Society as well as the Religious Tract Society.3 Ministers of the Church of England and of the Congregational and Baptist dissenting groups were particularly involved. The Wesleyan, Dr. Adam Clarke, contributed heavily.4 The profits, after expenses, were to go to support the British and Foreign Bible Society,5 but it was later said that the first proprietors lost con siderably in the endeavor.6 As with many literary ventures, finances were a continuing problem and circulation a constant concern.7 Initially, the political perspective of the Review was broad, supporting "the leading principles of the British Constitution, which happily combines the advantages of Monarchy, Aristocracy and Democracy."8 Subjects spanned the wide spectrum of interests and concerns of the educated Christian gendeman 'Che 179</page><page sequence="2">Victorian Periodicals Review 27:3 Fall 1994 of the early nineteenth century, with an emphasis on religious works only slighdy stronger than that of other reviews of the period. Thus the first number reviewed two new German religious studies, a broad geographical work, a tour of the Holy Land, a history of Athens, a Persian grammar, a natural history, a biography, a poem, a novel, and two historical works. The desire for a serious review raised an issue concerning the appropriateness of reviewing "lighter" lit erature, i.e., novels. The editors were "convinced that the habit of perusing nov els, in general, tends to dissipate, and commonly to mislead the mind"; therefore, the stated intention was not often to notice "performances of this kind."9 However, this early resolution modified as the century progressed. Unfortunately, the "eclectic" stance between the theological and politi cal bases of Dissent and Establishment very soon proved impossible to main tain without offence to varying political sensibilities and differing theological certitudes. After the first year the Establishment clergymen withdrew their support. The journal gradually became solely a voice for the nonconformist point of view on issues of the day and after Robert Hall's articles on "Zeal without Innovation" were published in 1809, the evangelical party in the Establishment denounced the Review angrily.10 The first editor had been the Reverend Samuel Greatheed, of Newport Pagnel, a friend of William Cowper and a founder of the London Missionary Society.11 But his wife's death and his own impaired health soon led to his resignation. He was succeeded in 1806 by a young neighbor, Daniel Parken.12 A barrister-at-law of Lincoln's Inn, Parken had begun writing for the journal as early as February 1805 when he reviewed Marsh's Juvenal, fol lowed in April and May by a two-part review of Lord Teignmouth's Life of William Jones.13 He was 21 when he became editor, a position he held until his early death at 27 in July 1812.14 He was followed by Theophilus Will iams, the son of Rev. Dr. Edward Williams of Rotherham, who occupied the post for less than two years.15 During these nine years many articles were written by the essayist, John Foster, a nonconformist minister who wrote for the Review from 1806 until 1839.16 In 1807 he declined the editorship offered by Daniel Parken, because of his concern that a review restricted to "religious generalities" would preclude numberless topics. However, as this attempted eclecticism faded he contributed more and more. He wrote a total of 184 articles, most of them prior to 1814.17 Another early and frequent contributor was the poet James Montgom ery, who claimed that Parken, Foster, and himself "had nearly the whole Review" in their own hands at one period. Montgomery's first article was in June 1806, on Cumberland's Memoirs, but after that he reviewed mostly i8o</page><page sequence="3">poetry and literature. After Parkens death he became "more shy" and wrote very little. In all he claimed to have contributed 31 articles to the Review.18 Other early contributors included Robert Hall, who reviewed Foster's Essays in November and December 1805; Olinthus Gregory, the mathemati cian; Adam Clarke, the Wesleyan divine, and John Pye Smith, a prolific Non conformist who had studied at Rotherham under Dr. Edward Williams.19 In January 1814 the Review's publisher, Josiah Conder, became its edi tor and proprietor, a post he retained until December 1836. Conder was a self-educated man, a poet and publisher, who had lost an eye as a child from smallpox, but who nonetheless supported his family with various literary endeavors all his life. During the years he edited the Eclectic, he himself con tributed extensively to its pages, often writing at least half of the Review and occasionally the whole issue.20 He wrote with amazing facility and rapidity and used extracts freely, believing that his readers were capable of forming a judgment for themselves on the value of a work if he gave them guidance and extracts. He was well thought of by his contemporaries. In 1821 Robert Southey remarked, "The Eclectic is in able hands. Conder is of Puritanical extraction and a thorough Independent. He is a clever, clear-headed, good man."21 James Montgomery described him as "a poet of no mean rank, a critic of for midable authority, and a polemic of rare skill, and ? which is much more rare ? of exemplary moderation in wielding the most perilous weapons that can be taken into human hands."22 Other contributors under Conder's editorship, aside from himself and John Foster, included most of the well-known Dissenters of the period. Men like Robert Hall, Henry Rogers, Issaac Taylor, John Pye Smith, George Red ford, and Robert Vaughan, who later edited the British Quarterly Review, rep resented the best in the tradition of nonconformity. The doctor, David Uwins, and journalists like S. C. Hall enlivened its pages. Some men were said to have written during this period for whom as yet no specific articles have been identified: James Mill, Thomas Chalmers, Dr. Benjamin Robin son, Charles Marsh, John Campbell, Joseph Gilbert, Thomas Morell, Will iam Orme, Thomas Binney, John Styles, and Samuel Thodey.23 The Review sold for two shillings sixpence, and its range of subjects continued extensive. Besides works on theology and collections of sermons, the subjects of literature, biography, history, travel, politics, medicine, agri culture, philosophy, and fine arts were covered. The abolition of slavery was a cause that found serious and constant support, as did other political issues that arose from the nonconformists' continuing battle for freedom of thought, politics, and religion. The aim of the Review as expressed in 1832 was "literary respectability, critical impartiality, and religious consistency."24 i8i</page><page sequence="4">Victorian Periodicals Review 27:3 Fall 1994 Thirty years after its founding, the reputation of the Eclectic was described by James Grant in his Great Metropolis1** in these flattering terms: The Eclectic Review has always been remarkable for the talent and learn ing with which it has been edited.... Having identified itself with the cause of Dissent, its circulation is chiefly among Dissenters. It is to be regretted it should not find its way into general circulation; for never did a periodical better deserve it. It ought at any rate be extensively read by the friends of Liberal principles; for its advocacy of those principles is equally characterized by earnestness, perseverance, boldness, and ability.. .. Were the claims of The Eclectic brought fairly before the pub lic, it could not fail to command an extensive circulation. ... I never knew a happier union of literature and religion. The effort that Josiah Conder put into editing and writing Review was staggering. As early as 1821 he wrote: "I am almost sick of the work; it is an ungracious and laborious and not very profitable task to conduct it; and had I a few additional hundreds ... I should have great pleasure in publishing a farewell number." In March 1826, he complained, "I have just got through a month of literary labour that I dreaded to look forward to, and almost shud der to look back upon ? 12 sheets to compose and print in 24 days ? i.e., 96 octavo pages, and 216 in 18 mo. Through the goodness of God my health has lasted me through it all . . . Literature is not my pursuit, but my business."26 By 1835 he was protesting, "Besides a weekly newspaper [The Patriot, which he began editing in 1832] and a monthly journal [The Eclectic] rest ing chiefly on my shoulders, I have in the last two years, finished and printed my Geographical Dictionary and put forth Wages or the Whip, Letter to the King, 'Introduction to Dwight's Armenia, New Translation of the Epistle to the Hebrews, new edition of Thomas Johnsons Reasons for Dissent, with new dialogue, 'Itinerary' to the second edition o? Italy, and the Evangel ical Almanack."27 Finally, after editing and writing the Eclectic for twenty-three years, Conder found relief: I have ... long groaned under the burden of my editorial honours and responsibilities, not feeling able to manage the Eclectic and the Patriot, without being on the constant stretch of anxiety and exertion.... Mr. Price being laid aside from the ministry wishes to employ himself usefully and beneficially; and has embarked ... in the adventure of raising the sale of the Eclectic, so as to make it, what it has long ceased to be, a source of profit to the proprietor.28 182</page><page sequence="5">Conder continued to write for the Review but his gratitude at being relieved of his editorial burdens was plain to read in his "Farewell Address" printed in the December 1836 issue (Vol. 64 o.s., p. 553): Surely [the Editor may be permitted ... to make this avowal on resigning an office which, though attended with many gratifications, is in some respects a thankless and invidious one, and which he would have often felt insupportably irksome ... had he not been sustained ... by the endeav our to fulfil his assigned part "As ever in (his) great Task-Masters eye." Thomas Price had been a Baptist minister before he became editor of the Eclectic. He was fully aware of the focus he wished to bring to the jour nal: "That Dissenters have been lamentably insensible to the advantages which the press confers ? of its power, as an instrument of diffusing their opinions and of giving concentration to their efforts, is notorious." The Eclectic was the only periodical exclusively devoted to the maintenance of those great principles, political and religious, in which all denominations of ortho dox Dissenters are agreed; it is the only journal which avowedly and sys tematically views general literature with a reference to its bearing on religion, and which ... advocates the great principle ... the purely volun tary character of all religion.29 During his editorship, articles were contributed by men such as F. W. Newman, George Gilfillan, James Godkin, James A. St.John, Cyrus Edmonds, and many Congregational and Baptist ministers, including those who had written earlier for Conder. After nine years of effort in November 1849 Price, with the excuse of ill health, tried to unload the responsibilities of editorship.30 But after three issues he resumed the office. A violent dispute had arisen between the new editor, William Linwood, a former Unitarian minister from Brixton, turned evangelical, who also edited the Nottingham Review,31 and the editor of the British Banner, John Campbell, a man of strong opinions who had no hesitation in expressing them.32 The quarrel concerned a review by Samuel Brown of George Gilfillan's essay on Ralph Waldo Emerson in his Literary Portraits (no. 2777 below). Campbell, with all the vituperation of wounded orthodoxy, attacked the Eclectic zn? its new editor. To save the journal from calumny and total destruction, Price resumed the editorship. He obtained the assistance of William Hendry Stow ell, who continued to sub-edit until 1857.33 183</page><page sequence="6">Victorian Periodicals Review 27:3 Fall 1994 In December 1854 Price again attempted to escape the burdens of edi torship by turning the Review over to Dr. John Harris, who, after agreeing, begged off due to ill health.34 Finally at the end of 1855, after nineteen years as editor, Price managed to find a successor.35 The man who replaced him in January 1856 was Jonathan Edwards Ryland of Northampton. Though constitutionally shy and reserved, Ryland was learned and well-known for his translations and other literary endeav ors.36 It was said that although the Review ceased to lead opinion as it had under Conder, it still was of service, particularly to young writers who wished to try their strength on serious subjects.37 Two of these young men, John Brown Paton and Robert W. Dale, began to write for the journal and soon decided to try to revive its failing reputation.38 The editorship transferred from Ryland to J. B. Paton sometime between January 1857 and January 1859. Exactly when has not yet been determined. Culross said that Ryland edited "for a short time"; Dale could not remember when or why Ryland resigned, only that it was "a year or two" after he (Dale) began writing in 1856; Paton speaks as editor in the winter of 1858-1859, but otherwise his quoted letters are undated.39 There was a distinct change in the format of the journal when the Sixth Series began in January 1857: the "Quarterly Reviews" of French, German, and American literature began, Paton probably writing the German; but Romeo Elton, writing the American, was a good friend of Ryland's.40 Dale also remarked that he wrote more short notices after Paton assumed the editorship, which might suggest January 1858 when he began the "Monthly review of public events."41 By January 1859, when the Seventh Series began and there was again a change of format and also of publisher, Paton was clearly the editor.42 His friend, Dale, acted as his assistant, if not exactly as co-editor. Dale's descrip tion of this loose and amorphous editorial relationship illustrates the prob lems and confusions that often arise in trying to pin down exactly who owned, edited, and wrote many Victorian periodicals. In some undefined way, I shared the editorship with him. But Dr. Paton was a man of enormous energy, and, as far as editing was concerned, I was very much in the position ? I was about to say ? of a sleeping part ner. That description, however would be singularly inappropriate. For once or twice in the month Dr. Paton used to come to me about 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening, and we discussed subjects and writers till mid night or till 2 o'clock in the morning, and then he left for his train; so that, whatever share I had in editing the 'Eclectic* was rather hostile than friendly to sleep.43 184</page><page sequence="7">Paton lived in Sheffield and traveled to London to manage the business of the Eclectic. He was a man of boundless energy as is revealed by his daily schedule: from 6 to 9:30 in the morning he devoted to Oriental studies, Arabic, or Syriac, then from 9:30 to 12:30 to English, Greek, Latin, French, or German; 12:30 to 2:30, dress and visit parishioners; 2:30 dinner, fol lowed by reading poetry or a newspaper; tea at 4; 4:30 to 6:00 work on the Eclectic, 6 to 9:30 on literature.44 Editing the Eclecticwas a manageable task, but the business aspects soon led him to seek assistance. He was willing to risk his own money, but he feared that the unknown responsibilities might ruin him. Accordingly, in 1859, with the help of nonconformist philanthro pists like "Samuel Morley, John Crossley of Halifax, F. Barnes, and Mr. Perry of Chelmsford," the review was put on a new footing and published by a new firm.45 Fresh features were introduced, such as articles that were discreet essays, not just reviews, and were occasionally signed. There were nature sketches and descriptions of travel, political articles advocating the extension of suf frage, the shortening of the duration of Parliaments, vote by ballot. Educa tion of the people and social questions such as the drainage of the metropolis, the treatment of the insane, the "Beer Bill" and the smoke nui sance were discussed. Contributors, besides the editor himself, included Alfred Wills, the founder of the English Alpine Club, P. H. Gosse, the zoolo gist, Alexander Smith, the poet, John Tulloch, Walter Thornbury, James Baldwin Brown, Mary Howitt, Anne Manning, and Frederika Bremen Sid ney Dobell wrote and also assisted Paton with "the business of literary mat ters." Paton called him "my secretary of state in rebus Eclecticism But these journalistic labors brought Paton no lasting satisfaction. He agreed with J. S. Mill that there were inherent drawbacks to periodical litera ture ? unlike books it could not wait for success; it had to succeed immedi ately or not at all; and for that reason it was "almost forced to profess and inculcate opinions already held by the public" to which it appealed; it could not do the "more solid work of rectifying opinion and shaping out new thought."47 Therefore, after the issue for January 1861, he passed the editor ship along to Edwin Paxton Hood.48 Hood, who wrote the whole of the February number himself, tried sev eral gambits to revive the failing Review. First, he attempted to return to reviews rather than articles, to lower the price to one shilling, and to increase the size from 112 to 128 pages. He proclaimed that he hoped to appeal to a broad audience by placing the Eclectic somewhere between "the lighter Monthly and the heavier Quarterly" (meaning especially the British Quar terly Review, which had become a serious rival since its founding by Robert Vaughan in 1845). He planned to include elements to "render it a fitting 185</page><page sequence="8">Victorian Periodicals Review 27:3 Fall 1994 companion for the Instructive Sabbath afternoon ? interesting for the wife and daughter" as well as for the "Christian scholar". He led off each issue with a biographical article, often written by himself, and he occasionally attacked other periodicals in a polemical manner, particularly The Saturday Review?? Finally, he intended to help nonconformists define and compre hend the principles behind their beliefs. By the end of 1863 he went further in this direction, by renaming the journal The Eclectic and Congregational RevieuP?, and including a new sec tion called "The Congregational Topic" after the reviews. But the notorious neglect of literature by nonconformists, and the frag mentation of sects, problems that had plagued each editor in turn, together with the increasing numbers of periodicals and newspapers clamoring for readers' attention finally wore down even the enthusiasm and literary fecun dity of Paxton Hood. After December, 1868 the Eclectic Review ceased to exist. For sixty-four years it had been the principal monthly review represent ing the political, moral, theological, and social values of the nonconformist movement in England. It had begun when dissenters were practically treated as pariahs and outcasts, denied the ordinary privileges of citizenship, and it had fought bravely to extend their rights and privileges, while supporting their evangelical Christian beliefs. Although each editor had struggled with financial difficulties and had written extensively himself, the Review had remained faithful to those interests of civil and religious freedom on which it had been founded, and as such its pages remain excellent sources for the study of the progress of liberal ideas in Victorian England.

Note on Attributions The appended list of attributed articles is largely the result of work done at The WelUsley Index to Victorian Periodicals during the years when its editor, Walter Houghton, intended to use The Eclectic, together with The British Quarterly Review, as the best examples of a nonconformist monthly and quarterly. After a year or two of basic research he decided that the attribution rate for the Eclectic was not sufficiently high to warrant inclusion in his already overcrowded series of Index volumes. Also the fact that the Eclectic began in 1805 and that many of its best articles appeared prior to 1824, the 189</page><page sequence="12">Victorian Periodicals Review 27:3 Fall 1994 arbitrary date at which the Index commenced indexing all periodicals it cov ered, was a concern. Therefore research on the Eclectic ceased. As the follow ing attributions will show, most of the work done covered the period from 1824 to 1837, the last half of the editorship of Josiah Conder. Research on earlier and later issues is sketchy and incomplete. Many contributors during the earlier years have been mentioned in the text, but, with no indexing done for that period, their articles are not included in the following list. Also there is a list of proposed contributors for Dr. Price's editorship (1837-1855) in the Eclectic, Vol. 65, pp. 3-4 following p. 628, on whom little or no research has been done. It should perhaps be mentioned that manuscript materials in the form of letters to or from the editors or known contributors were diligently searched for by the Index's British researchers and very little material of that nature was found. One would hope that future research might yield more. Evidence for these attributions is given in very abbreviated form. When a "Cf." to a certain work appears here, it generally indicates that verbatim passages will be found with such a comparison, but due to space limitations exact pages have not been included. Where the evidence is internal, the attri bution has been given a "prob." and reference is made to brief stylistic descriptions given in the "Evidence Notes" below. Mention of the "Baptist Historical Library copy" refers to a few marked numbers that were exhumed by an Index researcher in the bowels of the Baptist Historical Library in Lon don. The abbreviation "R.L.F." indicates the Archives of the Royal Literary Fund, now on microfilm held by various libraries. The "Simpson Papers" are in Dr. Williams's Library, London. Fuller evidence for most of these attribu tions is documented in the archives of the Wellesley Index to Victorian Period icals, Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts. In the biographical list of authors, no dates or sources are given for authors found in The Wellesley Index, Vol. V, but this information is included for new contributors. Evidence Notes 1 Josiah Conder. Elements present in his articles include: citation of earlier reviews, often with the phrase, "We have lately had occasion to notice"; a tendency to mention books he has previously reviewed and to list Contents or substance, usually in large Roman numer als; citation of specific authorities ? travellers: Burckhardt, Humboldt, Pococke, Malte Brun; the historian Gibbon; religious authorities like Calvin (often quoted in the original), Howe, Hooker, Michaelis and Mosheim; characteristic terms "taste," "feeling," "senti ment," "pathos," "sensibility," "genuine," and "advert"; much use of extracts (see Eclectic Review 42, Oct. 1825, p. 360, "We ... reviewers and wholesale extract-makers"); being a 190</page><page sequence="13">poet, he normally reviewed poetry, he sometimes wrote a whole issue, his usual quantum being around half: Conder, Memoir, pp. 126, 210, 255, 256, 260. 2 John Ryley. In Vol. 64, Dec. 1836, p. 551, Conder refers to "his valued friend, John Ryley, Esq. of Leicester to whose varied articles of sound criticism the readers of the Eclectic Review have been indebted during nearly the whole period of its existence; in no. 844, Ryley says that he often wrote on art for the Eclectic and in no. 905, p. 551, that he has "given the leisure hours of a life to the study of the fine arts"; the technical discussion of Corregios use of light and shade is echoed in no. 277; recognizable stylistic elements, including his frequent reference to maps and prints, are found. 3 J. J. Park. In 1836 (no. 1353, p. 550) Conder listed "the late Prof. Park" as a contributor; man cited died in 1833, was professor of law at Kings College, London, and the only law yer on Conder s list; he made a special study of foreign systems of jurisprudence; cf. his Juridicial Letters, 1832. 4 Thomas Mitchell. Compare this learned, scholarly article with Quarterly Review 9 (Mar. 1813), pp. 139-161, and Quarterly Review 21 (Apr. 1819), pp. 271-301; for authorship of these QR articles, see Gent. Mag. 178, Aug. 1845, p. 203. 5 David Uwins. Uwins was a contributor (see no. 1353, p. 550); the opening sentence in no. 101, "No science is less reducible to abstract rules than the science of medicine" is a char acteristic concept ? cf.nos.198, 568; his articles discuss scientific subjects professionally enough to interest the expert and popularly enough to involve the layman (compare his Indigestion, p. x) and in general take a middle of the road approach, weighing the evidence on all sides. 6 George Redford. Redford was a contributor (see no. 1353, p. 551); his obituary in The Patriot, June 7, 1860, p. 370 describes his attack on popery and his "spirited attack on Owenism and Infidelity" (see no. 137, pp. 101-104, 107-109); he attended the Univer sity of Glasgow. 7 George Payne. Payne was a contributor (see no. 1353, p. 551); his book Elements of Mental and Moral Science, 1828, is cited in no. 561; principle authorities are Brown, Reid and Stewart; belief in close relationship between mans concept of "nature and laws of the mind" and his theological opinions was a recurrent theme; stylistic characteristics include frequent use of italics, beginning paragraphs with "Secondly," "Thirdly," parenthetical remarks, use of dashes. 8 Henry Rogers. Rogers was a contributor (see no. 1353, p. 551); style includes: occasional very short paragraphs, parenthetical comments; remarks like, "Having now discharged a very unpleasant duty, we proceed to notice ..." or "Having made these preliminary remarks, we proceed to ..." (see nos. 1281, 1407, 1379, 1449); use of italics for emphasis. 9 Francis Watts. Listed as a contributor in no. 1405, Watts was in Germany in 1835, studied at Halle, knew Tholuck and other German divines (see Congregational Yearbook, 1874, p. 361); in no. 1321 reviewer is indebted to a learned friend recently returned from Germany for much of the information in the article. 10 George Lowe. Listed as a contributor in no. 1405, Lowe was a Fellow of the Royal Soci ety, and "entered actively into various fields of scientific enquiry and was elected a Fellow of the Geological, of the Chemical and of the Microscopical Societies": Inst. of Civil Engi neers, Minutes of Proceedings, 30, 1870, p. 443. 191</page><page sequence="14">Victorian Periodicals Review 27:3 Fall 1994 11 Thomas Price. See the first paragraph of no. 1361 for six examples of his most distinctive stylistic quirk, the frequent use of double nouns and adjectives; also cf. nos. 1369, 1380, 1405. 12 Matthew Bridges. No. 1781 contains verbatim passages with Rambler 14, Oct. 1854, pp. 291-317; his florid style is characterized by alliterations, hyperbole and nature imagery, anthropomorphisms, smatterings of Latin tags, allusions to Guizot, Shakespeare, Walter Scott, and various classical or Biblical figures. 13 Saxe Bannister. Compare no. 1542; stylistic similarities include: the italicizing of whole phrases, the use of footnotes, the appearance of occasional one sentence paragraphs; Ban nister was attorney general in New South Wales from 1823-1826: see DNB. 14 William Groser. Listed as a contributor in no. 1405, he came to London in September 1839, had some "literary work in a few days" and "in a few weeks" went to work as secretary to a group organizing to prevent the opium trade: see Baptist Magazine, Sept. 1856, p. 529. 15 Robert Vaughan. Listed as a contributor in no. 1353, p. 551, Vaughans style and basic con cepts are often recognizable; cf. his published books: Life of John de Wyclijfe (1829), Memo rials of the Stuart Dynasty (1831), Causes of Corruption in Christianity (1834), History of England (1840), and Revolutions in English History (1859-1861); concern for "impartiality" in a historian, for "right of private judgement in religion," belief that "tyranny is equal tyr anny" no matter who exercises it, references to other articles by himself are hallmarks; see also the evidence block in Wellesley Index, Vol. IV, Brit. Quart. Reu no. 1. 16 James Robertson. Listed as a contributor in no. 1353, p. 550; parallel ideas and usages found in articles attributed to him include concern for the "integrity" of texts, advocacy of methods for determining their genuineness by use of the "established laws of criticism", and emphasis on "true learning" versus "prejudice". 17 Evidence for no. 3796. Attr. to R.WDale in his Life, appendix, and to J. B. Paton in his Life, p. 70; for the editorial collaboration of these two men, see the discussion above; with the kind of collaboration they had in editing the Review, collaborating on an article is entirely possible; stylistic evidence, although pointing slightly to Dale, is inconclusive. 18 Edwin Paxton Hood, a Congregational minister, edited the Eclectic from Feb. 1861 until its demise in Dec. 1868. In December 1861 (see Vol. 113 o.s., Dec. 1861, p. 659) he claimed to have written the whole number for Feb. 1861. His style is highly distinctive. Common usages include: frequent editorial "we" and references to "our readers"; compound words like "severity and satire," "interest and charm," "glory and boast"; metaphor and hyperbole as in "a river of speech to the great mysterious ocean beyond"; inverted sentences like "Great must be the changes ..."; poetic quotations, often couplets; admiration of Macaulay and no patience with Gibbon; references, usually critical, to other reviews, espe cially the Saturday Review and the Athenaeum. His major interests, besides the political and theological problems of Dissent, include biography, history, poetry, travel, art, folklore and ethnology. He is very fond of anecdotes (cf. his World of Anecdotes, 1872). 192</page><page sequence="15">Index of Articles Index of Articles 0 0 &amp; VOLUME 39, JANUARY 1824 I Travels in Egypt and Nubia, 1-33.

The 1995 meeting of RSVP will take place July 11-13 in Edin burgh. The Conference theme is "Defining Centres: The 19th Century Media and the Construction of Identities." Proposals (200-300 words) for 20-30 minute papers are requested. The restriction of Media Studies to the products of 20th century culture is a practice that this conference seeks to challenge. Papers or presentations which scrutinize hegemonic notions of the metropolitan, the provincial, the local and the national in relation to media of the 19th century are invited. Pieces which address the construction of par adigms of reading attaching to particular forms of the press are also encour aged, but proposals on other topics which address the 19th century media from a diversity of viewpoints are welcome. Proposals and enquiries should be sent to arrive by December 30, 1994, to Dr. L. Brake, CEMS, Birkbeck College, 26 Russell Square, London, WC1B, 5DQ, UK.

Mss may be submitted to Anne Skabarnicki, Editor, Department of English, Royal Mili tary College of Canada, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7K 5LO. VPR announces a special issue, "Victorian Women Editors and Critics" to be edited by D. J. Trela. Women who served as critics, readers for or editors of journals exercised a degree of power that was unusual for this era. Who were these women? How did they exercise their authority? What do we learn about them through study of their work and their periodicals? Preliminary inquiries, proposals, or manuscripts should be sent to D. J. Trela, School of Liberal Studies, Roosevelt University, Box 288, 430 S. Michigan Ave., Chi cago, IL 60605-1394 by March 1, 1995. Papers in final form will be due by Sept., 1995. It is anticipated that the special issue will be number 2, 1996. The OED is currendy undergoing a comprehensive revision. As part of the enterprise, the editors would like to encourage scholars to send in materials or suggestions which may have a bearing on the revision. They hope to reach a broad spectrum of academics across a range of historical and literary disci plines. Please contact Dr. Bernadette Paton, Senior Editor, Oxford English Dictionary, OUP, Walton St., Oxford OX2 6DP UK. VPR is pleased to announce ? albeit very belatedly ? that Anne Lundin is the Society's new bibliographer. Dr. Lundin is Assistant Professor in the School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin ? Madison. Scholars who wish to help compile the annual bibliography are urged to contact her at Room 4258, Helen C. White Hall, 600 N. Park St., Madison, WI 53706 USA. Correction Mary Lu MacDonald's "English and French-Language Periodicals and the Development of a Literary Culture in Early Victorian Canada," 26 (Winter, 1993) contains a serious error on p. 224: The discussion of Barkers Cana dian Monthly Magazine should read "1000 subscribers were necessary to sus tain it at the price charged, and there had only been 400." 281</page><page sequence="104">Victorian Periodicals Review 27:3 Fall 1994 Letters I was dismayed by the state in which my two recent contributions to VPR were published. And I am not referring to typos (one has come to expect those in our slovenly times), though there were plenty of them. First there was "Alexander Macmillan and His Magazine," which came out in the Summer 1993 VPR (26: 105-08) with the last two pages of my manuscript inexplicably omitted and with one paragraph (the second new one on p. 107) butchered beyond recognition. After I had called the matter to your attention, you kindly made amends by publishing the missing pages in the Fall 1993 number (26: 133-34) ? this time leaving out most of one line from the penultimate paragraph. And then there was u Macmillans Magazine and the American Civil War: A Reconsideration," which appeared in Winter 1993 (26: 193-98). There were two main problems with this article. You printed the version I had originally submitted in June 1992, rather than the new and improved version I had gone to some trouble to do up eight months later, incorporat ing several excellent suggestions made by your reader. That caused me no great concern; after all, if I had not considered that first version worth pub lishing I would not have submitted it. More serious was ? again! ? the omission of lines, from the third paragraph on p. 193 and the paragraph ending at the top of p. 196. The mistakes in the published versions of these two articles were too extensive and too numerous to identify and correct in this space. But if any one Out There would like to see what I actually wrote, I would be happy to send intact, pristine copies, hot off my printer, on request. Please specify "Alexander Macmillan and His Magazine," "Macmillans Magazine and the American Civil War" Mark I, "Macmillans Magazine and the American Civil War" Mark II, or any two, or all three. No stamped, self-addressed envelopes required. George J. Worth English Department University of Kansas Lawrence, KS 66045 282</page><page sequence="105">Endnotes I received my Spring 1994 issue of VPR yesterday and must inform you that I am bitterly disappointed with your treatment in it of my article on Hutton and "resisting medium." What should be the third line of type in the open ing paragraph is entirely missing, making nonsense of the first sentence in the article. On the first page (p. 25), 1. 17, "Mr. Tennyson's Poems..." should read "Mr. Tennyson's Poem." On p. 26,1. 4, "Ecomony" should read "Economy," and on 1. 5 "November 20" should read "November 30." On p. 27,1. 13, the page number for the article of 2 Jan. 1864 should be 4, not 2. And in two cases parentheses have not been closed (pp. 25, 30). Robert H. Tener Editors Note The first sentence of the article should read: "In his fine pioneering study of the Victorian critic Richard Holt Hutton, Malcolm Woodfield draws atten tion to the image, "resisting medium," in Hutton's criticism of the poetry of Tennyson, not just in his major essay on the poet but also in an article about him nearly a decade later (Woodfield 144, 145). The publication of VPR 27, 3, marks the resumption of the practice of supplying proof copies to contributors for final proofreading. Problems alluded to by Worth and Tener should be alleviated from this point forward. We apologize for any inconvenience, while still protesting to George Worth that these are not such slovenly times.
