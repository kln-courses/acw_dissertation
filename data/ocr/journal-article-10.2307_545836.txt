Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiede- akatemia, 1987. Pp. xxxii + 392 pls. Ever since Sir John Marshall introduced the Indus Valley civilization to the world,' the "Harappan" seals have become the objects of numerous archaeological, art historical, and philological investigations. This handsome and superbly published book is the first in a three-part series that intends to present all the Harappan seals, sealings, tablets, and graffiti. The authors hope to provide an ob- jective basis to study the material firsthand by publishing the actual pieces in three large vol- umes. This is achieved by creating a comprehen- sive volume of the seals that are either unpublished, published incompletely, or pub- lished but out of print or are published with pho- tographs of inferior quality. This volume contains the seals from India, the second volume will be devoted to the seals from Pakistan, and the third to the collections outside India and Pa- kistan. At present, 4,200 Indus seals and inscrip- tions from 60 sites are known; 2,090 from Mohenjodaro; 1,490 from Harappa; 240 from Lothal; 140 from Kalibangan; 83 from Chanhujo- daro; and 44 from various other sites.2 Although basic issues concerning the Indus script and language are not unanimously agreed upon among scholars, attempts have been made to connect the Indus script, represented by some 3500 short inscriptions,3 with the Brahmi script, Sumerian, Proto-Elamite, Egyptian hi- eroglyphs, and Hittite, while the language has been thought to be Sumerian, Proto-Dravidic, Proto-Indo-European, Sanskrit, and so on (pp. xvii-xviii). The reason for this state of affairs is given as the lack of any keys to decipher it. Some scholars have expressed their pessimism in deciphering the Indus script,4 as the texts are short, with an average length of five signs (the longest has 26 signs, p. 121:M-494, and p. 122:M-495), and limited in nature and do not seem to have crucial elements, such as parallel inscriptions; proper, personal, and place names; word dividers, etc. Nevertheless, there is one point on which scholars agree and that is on the direction of writing from right to left." This, however, does not seem to be a consistent pat- tern. On some texts the inscription is on reverse and on a few boustrophedon (p. xviii). Asko Parpola and Jagat P. Joshi offer an ex- cellent source for the understanding of such problems. The book is basically a "catalogue raisonn6" with an introduction, which, although not intended to explore numerous linguistic, ar- chaeological, and art historical problems asso- ciated with the matter at hand, provides the reader with an authoritative review of these ob- jects and a useful bibliography. Both seals and their impressions are excel- lently reproduced. The book contains 1,537 In- dus seals and inscriptions which belong to various collections in India, with 25 percent of them published for the first time (pp. xxvi- xxvii). They are organized by: (1) provenance, i.e., the present location of the objects, not their archaeological find-spots; (2) type of ob- ject: seals, tablets, graffiti (inscriptions incised or painted on pottery), and miscellaneous; (3) shape of the object within the type; (4) iconography; and (5) imported objects, coming last in each category (p. xxvii). The seals remain the most impressive, and yet enigmatic and tantalizing, artifacts of Harappan civilization. They are mostly made of steatite. In most cases, they have a pierced boss at the back to accommodate a cord for handling or for use as pendant. When the carv- ing was completed, the objects were covered with an alkali coating and fired, producing a fine lustrous, white finish. Not all the seals have the same quality, a fact dependent on their size, i.e., larger seals are of better quality.

The most impressive collection of sealings comes from Lothal, a Harappan port town (p. xv). They seem to include various types, such as tags, bale/bag sealings (pp. 268-90), and pos- sibly some door sealings (for example, see p. 278:L-172A and p. 286:L-206A 1-2). With a few exceptions, unfortunately, the book pro- vides neither impressions nor photographs of the back of these sealings which will be of ut- most importance for the reconstruction of the Harappan economic administrative system.6 These seals may be considered the first ob- jets d'art of India with features that were to be the hallmarks of Indian art. Animal, floral, and human motifs occur most often. The animals are diverse and superbly executed; they in- clude, for example, the tiger (p. 77:M309- 310), elephant (p. 189:H91-92), rhinoceros (p. 67:M274-277), hare (p. 190:H95), croco- dile (p. 71:M292), antelope (p. 57:M233), bull (pp. 58-59:M234-239), composite animals (p. 73:M298), and a curious single-horned ox (p. 30:M67-69). This ox is humpless and re- ferred to as "unicorn" bull. It is frequently as- sociated with an unidentified object which is variously known as incense-brazier, altar, or manger.7 The authors believe that the "uni- corn" is likely to be a real animal with two horns and that one horn appears missing be- cause it is shown in profile (p. xxx). But, since there are other bicorn animals represented with two horns, such as bulls, goats, etc., and since Harappan gylptic art is far from true profile, it is likely that this creature was intended to rep- resent a unicorn animal. In fact, in a rather common motif of a composite animal with three heads, this "unicorn" is depicted with one horn, while the other two animals each have two (see, for example, p. 306:K-43). The human forms are less successfully real- ized than those of the animals but more enig- matic in interpretation. The yoga position of the horned deity on a low throne (p. 75:M304) seems to be an early manifestation of a deity in India (Shiva?; p. xvii).8 The seal of a man wearing a bull headdress or a bull-headed (not depicted here) man which recurs in the sev- enth-eighth-century stone reliefs of Mamal- lapuran, near Madras, where Durga slays the buffalo demon.9 Other seals represent an ithy- phallic seated deity who wears a horned head- dress and is surrounded either by land or water animals. There are also seals (not represented here) that illustrate huge numbers of bulls, bull-wrestling, and bull-vaulting taking place before a head icon on a pole (both these cus- toms still survive among aboriginal people of India) and of bull sacrifice before a tree. Other strange motifs include a phallic-headed croco- dile, a female figure engaged in sexual inter- course with one such beast, and several different animals sharing a common head. All these scenes seem to suggest religious ceremo- nies with fertility and anthropomorphic nature deities. 1 This and the following volumes will provide an excellent and useful source for studies in ancient Harappan civilization. Although not the first collection of Harappan archaeological ma- terials," the present edition is outstanding for its production qualities and encyclopedic as- pects. It is, indeed, such a scholarly and artistic accomplishment that it should satisfy even the 6 See my article "Socio-economic Complexity in Southwestern Iran during the 5th and 4th Millennia B.C.: The Evidence from Tall-i Bakun A," Iran 26 (1988): 17-34, and E.
