<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION THE PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH TO POLITICS ALAN GEWIRTH QNE of the striking developments in re- cent political thought has been the ex- ploitation of the psychological approach. Stemming from the work of writers like Wallas and Lippmann, who in turn had such antecedents as Bentham and Bagehot, the psychological approach has been stimulated positively by the growth of new branches of psychology, including psychiatry, psycho- analysis, and social psychology, and nega- tively by dissatisfaction with the traditional "political science" which proceeded by de- scribing the formal institutional arrange- ments of government and law. It was felt that this formal approach did not penetrate to the basic causes and realities underlying political phenomena and that these were to be found in the psychological sphere, in men's minds, emotions, and felt needs. Cor- relative with this view were the further criticisms that the traditional approach had overemphasized the rational at the expense of the far more influential irrational aspects of human nature and that in consequence its practical extensions had consisted in vague moralizing about rights, duties, and freedom without adequate insight into the scientific (which was taken to mean the psy- chological) bases of these moral ideas. The psychological politicists have done much fruitful work on specific problems. Such organizations as the Bureau of Ap- plied Social Research and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues and such individuals as Lasswell, Odegard, and Cantril have helped to clarify many aspects of public opinion and pressure politics; and the studies which have been made of the psychological underpinning of totalitarian regimes, especially that of Nazi Germany, have contributed greatly to the understand- ing of political phenomena. There has not, however, been a full-scale application of the psychological approach to the basic general problems of politics. The reaction against the traditional formulations has had the ef- fect that the concepts of the state, law, and government, on which those formulations had been based, have been dropped from the center of attention, and discussions have proceeded instead in terms of more particu- larized individual and group manifestations, or else of broad concepts transcending the political sphere. The consequence has been, however, that there has been no systematic theory applying the psychological approach to the phenomena which have constituted the central subject matter of traditional political thought. It is the important contribution of a new book by Sebastian de Grazia, entitled The Political Community: A Study of Anomie,' that it does take at least the basic steps to- ward such a systematic theory. In so doing, it makes highly skilful use of the most re- cent work in the various branches of psy- chology, combining these with relevant ma- terials from anthropology and sociology. The book therefore deserves a detailed ex- amination, both on its own account and be- cause it should help to ascertain the merits and shortcomings of the psychological ap- proach to politics. TE PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF THE STATE As is indicated by the title of his book, Professor de Grazia approaches the problem of the political community in terms of ano- mie. The word "anomie," resuscitated from Durkheim, is here defined as "a mental ten- sion which in its moderate type reveals an intermittent apprehension in the adult of a danger before which he is helpless and which in its severe type mounts to an anxi- ety fraught with terrifying images of a I Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I948.

"2 Anomie, then, is very similar to that Angst, angoisse which the ex- istentialists have made a central concept of their philosophy;3 and, although De Grazia does not mention the existentialist writers in this work, his theory is a reaction to and a political formulation of the same sense of anxiety and crisis on which the doctrines of Jaspers, Sartre, and others have been fo- cused. The relation between anomie and the po- litical community or state, according to De Grazia's theory, is an inverse or negative one: anomie rises and falls as the state be- comes weaker and stronger, respectively. The causal factor affecting these correla- tions is found in belief-systems, which are defined as "the ensemble of beliefs which men hold concerning activities that presum- ably contribute to their common welfare,"s so that the beliefs "express their ideas con- cerning their relationship to one another and to their rulers."6 The reason why these belief- systems are causally decisive with respect to anomie and the political community is that it is they which "hold together" the state: "Without them, without this fundament of commonness, no political community can be said to exist." But anomie occurs pre- cisely because of the weakening or disinte- gration of belief-systems: this is the central proposition which De Grazia's theory sets out to establish. Consequently, the preven- tion of anomie and the preservation of the state both require that the belief-systems be kept strong and inviolate. This, in brief summation, is what De Grazia calls his "theory of the political community."7 It will have been noted that the central position in it is held by the psy- chological concept of the "belief-system." While this is analogous to the older anthro- pological view, still current among politi- 2P. xi. 3 For De Grazia's use of these words cf. p. I23. 4 De Grazia uses these terms interchangeably (cf. p. I 7). S P. xiv. 6P.iX. 7P.XiV. cists, that the state rests on "myths,"8 the elucidation which De Grazia gives to it is in genetic psychological terms which explain how and why the need for beliefs arises. But it is precisely in this connection that a preliminary question about the meaning of the theory must be asked: In what sense do we have here a "theory of the political com- muniity"? This question is never directly faced by De Grazia; as a consequence, the sense in which it is a psychological theory is left ambiguous, despite his use of psycho- logical concepts throughout. The difficulty can be seen if, using an older terminology, we ask whether the belief-systems which "hold together" the political community constitute the essence, i.e., the sufficient condition, of that community, or only one of its necessary conditions or even a conse- quential property. If the first alternative is correct, then De Grazia is making the psy- chological function of belief-systems the very nature or constitutive essence of the state. But if the latter alternatives are cor- rect, then he has given us a theory of only one aspect of the political community, and that not the most essential one, so that there would still remain the need for a constitu- tive theory, proceeding in other than psy- chological terms, of what the state essen- tially is. While no direct statement is made by De Grazia with respect to these alternative in- terpretations of his theory, all the evidence points to the first as the one he intends. Thus in his opening chapter tracing the psy- chological development of the child from birth, he shows that systems of belief serve the indispensable function of curbing the child's anxiety over separation from his par- ents or other attendants. The child attrib- utes to his parents "the qualities of omni- science, omnipresence, omnitemporality, and omnimorality."9 Later, however, when 8 Cf. R. M. MacIver, The Web of Government (New York, I947), p. 4: "Every society is held to- gether by a myth-system, a complex of dominating thought-forms that determines and sustains all its activities."

I4, citing Jean Piaget.</page><page sequence="3">DISCUSSION 2I3 the child learns that his parents are subject to, and may be overcome by, external forces of nature, economics, politics, or war, the psychological crisis of disillusionment which results "is cushioned by the prior provision of the anthropomorphic symbols in reli- gious and political beliefs."Io It is here that the child first encounters the political com- munity. The omnipotent qualities formerly attributed to his parents are now shifted to religious gods and political chiefs; the acts which must be done or omitted are those conforming to their commands, accepted as matters of conscience or moral rules. Con- sequently, the community which rests on these beliefs in rulers and their commands is already a state: "For the purposes of this study it is only necessary that the [inter- family] groups under consideration have a name to refer to their collective selves and common history; they will then have inter- family morals plus a pattern of subordina- tion to persons, real or symbolic. In short, they will have a state."", These two factors of moral system and pattern of subordina- tion are, indeed, correlative, since the latter both rests upon and sanctions the former. Thus to the question, "What is it that makes a people a community?" De Grazia answers: "their religious and political be- liefs."12 As it emerges from this theory, then, the "state" is essentially the community of those who believe and those who are be- lieved in.I3 The former are the subject-citi- zens; for the latter De Grazia uses the itali- cized word ruler, defined as "the entity, tangible or intangible, which members of a community believe able to control those as- pects of the environment most necessary for the commonweal."I4 The commands ema- nating from the ruler as to what acts must be done or avoided will hence similarly depend essentially upon beliefs: De Grazia calls IO pi I5.

I4 P. 22; my italics for "believe." these commands "directives," defined as "the standards of conduct which, according to any given belief-system, the rulers re- quire of believers in order to regulate the environment for their benefit."I5 Thus De Grazia emphasizes that "The term 'direc- tives,' like the term ruler, refers to people's beliefs. They are ways people believe they must act to avoid trouble, fear, and anxi- ety."'6 And it is these directives which are the laws of the state.I7 What De Grazia has given us, then, is a theory which defines all the basic political concepts-state, ruler, citizen, law-in terms of beliefs. The beliefs, in turn, are de- fined in terms of their psychological func- tion, the removal of anxiety, the "assurance that critical situations of certain helpless- ness will not recur. Thus belief-systems serve as protection against the anxiety of separation provoked by such situations." This is put in negative terms, but the same function can be indicated positively: what- ever be the values held by the individual or group, beliefs are formulas for attaining these.I9 It can thus be seen why the concept of anomie is of such crucial importance for political theory, for anomie is the apprehen- sion or anxiety caused by the conflict or de- terioration of the directives of belief-sys- tems.20 Hence anomie signalizes the weaken- ing or destruction of the state. We must now examine whether this is a tenable theory of the state. Two points of crucial importance to this question will be discussed: first, the relation which is set up between the state and the function of be- lief-systems; second, the doctrine that the state requires for its preservation the re- moval of conflicts between belief-systems. BELIEF-SYSTEMS AND THE STATE Can the state and its various central as- pects be satisfactorily explained in terms of beliefs? This theory focuses attention upon an important dimension of politics.

To such doc- trines the psychological approach provides a valuable corrective. The difficulty is, how- ever, that De Grazia's theory suffers from a similar exclusiveness on the psychological side. Consequently, like other theories ex- plaining the state by one basic concept (whether power, economics, or reason), it is unable to do justice to the phenomena to which it purports to refer. In this respect it suffers from three basic shortcomings: it makes the realm of the political too broad; at the same time it restricts the political in such fashion that real political factors are obscured; and it ignores important distinc- tions within the political. i. One of the necessary conditions for a satisfactory theory of the state is that it permit the clear ascertainment of the dis- tinctive features which differentiate the state from other human associations. That there are such differentiating features De Grazia is himself aware, for he says that the state is "the highest secular association, 22 "the community which embraces all other communities,222 and accordingly is not to be confused with "the present-day associa- tions of trade-unions, of local communities, of employers, professions, and recreational groups. 223 Nevertheless, there is nothing in De Grazia's theory which would prevent us from calling any of these associations A "state," for each of them may operate to remove anxiety through a system of beliefs involv- ing common subordination to some author- ity. Indeed, De Grazia himself points out this function of such associations when he discusses them as modes of adaptation to simple anomie.24 Moreover, he declares that "no social organization is comprehensible apart from a political organization";25 and 2t P. I90. 22 P. iX. 23 P. I53. 24 Cf. pp. I44-53- 25 P. I7. he recognizes that on his definition of the ruler as "the entity which members of a community believe able to control those as- pects of the environment most necessary for the commonweal," not only are conven- tional "political" figures rulers, but also "re- ligious and economic figures and other en- tities."26 The difficulty which is here being indi- cated rests on the fact that, while De Grazia is propounding a psychological the- ory of the state, he wishes to avoid the con- sequences of this theory. On the one hand, he wishes his theory to provide for the ob- jective institutions of the state and for the objective human needs to which they an- swer; but, on the other hand, he intends, as we have seen, that all the central phases of the state be defined in terms of men's be- liefs regarding that which they believe to be most important to their welfare. The double reference to "belief" in the last sentence is intentional: What it indicates is De Grazia's theoretic position that beliefs are the very stuff of politics. Now this means that the important factor in politics is not what really is the case but what men believe to be the case. Thus "a person is not a ruler, no matter how powerful the forces at his com- marid, unless the members of the community believe in his capacity and willingness to guide and provide for them.... He lives and dies in the minds of his subjects."27 Hence the ruler is "one who seems to have the strength both to control the environ- ment and to strike fear into the hearts of the unrighteous."'2 Not only the concept of the ruler, but the very state itself, involves the same radical fideistic psychologism. It is not the possession of certain institutional fea- tures corresponding to what men objective- ly need that determines which associations are "states," but rather the entities which men believe to provide the things which they believe that they need. Consequently, if a man's strongest felt need is, say, for 26p. 22. 27 P. 22; my italics for "believe in." 28 P. 85; my italics.</page><page sequence="5">DISCUSSION 2I5 gaining a place on his neighborhood bowling team, and if the local baker controls-or, rather, is believed by him to control-the gaining of such a place, then, on De Grazia's theory, the bowling team becomes a "state," and the baker a ruler. What is lacking in this theory is precisely the factor which a radical psychologism makes impossible, namely, the means of in- dicating objective needs and the conditions, institutional and otherwise, of their fulfil- ment, as against what men think or believe about them. In a word, what De Grazia's theory has given us is the realm of appear- ance or opinion; what it lacks, but what nevertheless, in defiance of the theory, he wishes to retain, is the realm of reality or knowledge. For, protest as he may that a bowling team or a sewing circle will not sat- isfy men's deepest felt needs, or remove their greatest anxieties, yet on his theory, where beliefs are the crucial criteria, and where moreover the fact that men do relieve their anxieties in such ways is recognized, there is no reason why such phenomena may not be states and their leaders rulers. It will be recalled that he defined "belief-systems" themselves as "beliefs which men hold con- cerning activities that presumably contrib- ute to their welfare"29 and which "express their ideas concerning their relationship to one another and to their rulers."30 Hence, any object whatsoever which men "pre- sume" will contribute to their welfare is the content of their belief-system; but the be- lief-system is what constitutes the state and establishes the relation of ruler and ruled; consequently, anything which men presume will contribute to their welfare constitutes the sufficient basis for a state. If, however, De Grazia were to proceed by way of an analysis, not of what men may believe that they need, but of what they really need, i.e., of what their "welfare" really is, then his theory would have to be centered not solely or mainly in belief-sys- tems and anomie or anxiety but in the ob- jective conditions of human life and the fac- 29 P. xiv; my italics. 30 P. ix; my italics. tors required for their maintenance and ex- tension. He would then be able to show readily that only in the state can these con- ditions and factors be achieved, so that the distinction of the state from other associa- tions, and of rulers from rulers, would not be lost in confusion. Beliefs and anxiety would still have a place in such a theory but would not be made the sole independent variable. Indeed, in his chapters preliminary to the statement of his theory De Grazia himself recognized the distinction here being indi- cated, for he pointed out that "the need for beliefs cannot be regarded as irreducible"31 and went on to show that this need is de- rived from the need for cushioning the shocks of separation-anxiety. But when he came to propound his political theory prop- er, as we have seen, instead of making be- liefs dependent on objectively ascertainable conditions which are themselves not beliefs, and instead of defining the state and its parts in terms of such conditions, he makes beliefs themselves the essential content of the state. Underlying the issues which we are exam- ining is the metaphysical and epistemo- logical problem of phenomenalism. In every sphere, not only in that of politics, it has been contended by some philosophers that the distinction between appearance and reality is incapable of ascertainment or veri- fication, since any verificatory attempt will itself attain only to that which appears. In the sphere of the political this doctrine takes on special urgency, since it is held that there exists a political realm or problem only to the extent that men think so; the attempt to plumb beyond thoughts or be- liefs can lead only to obscurantism and au- thoritarianism. Now there is indeed a dan- ger in proceeding so completely in terms of objective realities that men's beliefs and convictions about these are ignored; for this may open the way to the absolutism of the few who claim absolute knowledge of the realities, as against the mere opinions of the multitude. But this danger is not removed by falling into the opposite extreme where 31 P. 5.</page><page sequence="6">2I6 ETHICS opinions are taken for the sole realities, for then the rhetorical manipulation of beliefs will make impossible the attainment of in- sight into the real problems to which the opinions purport to refer. Thus even a phe- nomenalistic politics, as Plato pointed out in the Theaetetus, must take account of the dis- tinction between real and apparent condi- tions. Nor is this distinction obviated by the fact that political "objects" (entia political) do not have precisely the same kind of ob- jective reality as natural objects (entia na- turalia) which in no way depend on the hu- man will. With respect to the general meta- physical claims of phenomenalism, similar- ly, there may indeed be a sense in which they are tenable; but, if so, it is only by re- introducing into the phenomenal sphere it- self the distinction between the apparent and the real. Yet De Grazia, far from mak- ing this distinction, makes beliefs simpli- citer, as we have seen, the definitory bases of his central political concepts. 2. A complementary aspect of the psy- chologistic predicament of De Grazia's the- ory emerges when we note that it extension- ally entails not only a multiplication of rulers but also an unrealistic restriction of rulers to the limits of men's beliefs. If the ruler and other central political concepts are defined solely in terms of beliefs, then the aspects of political authority and institu- tions which fall outside belief cannot be taken account of by the theory. No meaning can, therefore, be found for the distinction between real and apparent rulers, in the new sense of the difference between those who in fact exercise political control and those who are merely believed to do so. The former rulers are not, by definition, De Grazia's rulers; yet a doctrine which omits them is quite insufficient as a political theory. Had De Grazia made his extension of political communities and authorities to religious and business groups on the basis of the real con- trol which they may exercise, he would have been on firmer ground; but, as it is, his psy- chological orientation involves a complete overlooking of the behind-scenes influences which, while not observed and hence not believed in by the "subjects," may yet be very real. The pragmatic importance of this point is underlined by the consequences which De Grazia's psychological orientation entails for the solution of political problems; for when the essence of the political community is viewed in terms of its being held together by belief-systems, whose weakening or re- moval disrupts the community, then politi- cal problems come to be viewed as problems of strengthening such beliefs. But this in turn leads to an ignoring of the material factors underlying the problems, and an em- phasis solely upon the propagandistic incul- cation of beliefs. One of De Grazia's lengthy discussions of the mass movements arising out of acute anomie provides a clear illus- tration of this danger. He shows that the Nazi movement came to power because of the feeling of helplessness and anxiety which led millions of Germans to look for a new leader; and he shows that this anxiety was an effect of the collapse of the belief-systems which had previously supported the Ger- man people. But in addition he also recog- nizes that this ideological collapse was itself in turn the effect of the disastrous economic events, including gigantic inflation and un- employment, which beset Germany during the preceding period.32 What, now, is the conclusion which he draws from this causal sequence? Is it that the economic sphere was the basis of the problem and that a real solu- tion would have had to cope directly with this? On the contrary, he documents in de- tail the ideological reformation effected by the Nazis and infers that this constituted a solution: "It should be admitted, then, that Hitler and the National Socialists created a system of beliefs. They ended the endless terror."33 No indication is given that such a solution, decisive though it may have been in the psychological sphere, left unsolved the basic problems which engendered or greatly aggravated the psychological one in the first place. Yet such an indication, called for though it was by De Grazia's recognition of the economic causation of the Germans' 32pP. 174-75. 33p. 182.</page><page sequence="7">DISCUSSION 2I7 ideological disintegration, could have no place on his theory of the state and anomie in terms simply of belief-systems. This is not to say, of course, that all po- litical problems are fundamentally econom- ic or that important aspects of such prob- lems may not be psychological. It is rather that the overwhelming concentration on one of these factors to the exclusion of the others involved therein yields a result which is in- adequate both as theoretic explanation and as practical guide to resolutive action. In his Introduction, indeed, De Grazia denies that "contained in this book is an implicit sug- gestion that the elimination of anomie would remove most of the world's prob- lems."34 Yet this denial does not accord easily with his account of the genesis and function of the state exclusively in terms of belief-systems as cushions for separation- anxiety. And indeed he goes on to say that, "until the problem of the anomic commu- nity is solved, the other great problems can- not be properly approached." But if, as is probable, in the phrase "the anomic com- munity" he is referring directly to the psy- chological factors of anxiety stemming from the weakening of belief-systems, and not to the material problems out of which these in large part arise, it would seem that the re- verse sequence of solutions is at least equally plausible, and indeed will alone constitute a real solution. The specific solution which De Grazia propounds for the problems confronting the United States and the world is a direct illustration of that ignoring of material fac- tors which the psychological emphasis on belief-systems entails. The solution is that "the competitive directive" must be re- moved, for it is in conflict with the co-opera- tive ethic which is essential for the survival of the community.35 No indication is given of how this removal is to be accomplished, nor is there any recognition that more than removal of a "directive" is involved, such as a basic change in the material conditions of production, exchange, and distribution. 34 P. XV. 35 pp. I87-88. Thus the solution remains little more than an exhortation. 3. A further difficulty of the emphasis upon the political function of belief-systems as such is that it obscures the important political distinctions between the different kinds of content which belief-systems may have in different kinds of states and between the different methods by which they may serve their function. The sole emphasis is on the generic anti-anomic function of beliefs: "So long as clear and consistent belief-sys- tems prevail, anomie will spare the commu- nity, no matter what its brand of belief may be."36 The theory thus provides, within it- self, no means for differentiating between belief-systems which serve their cementing function by preaching doctrines of race hatred and aggressive war and those which do so with the opposite kinds of content. Again, De Grazia denies that his doctrine of the ruler has an authoritarian connotation, "for a person is not a ruler, no matter how powerful the forces at his command, unless the members of the community believe in his capacity and willingness to guide and provide for them.... In every case he is dependent on popular belief."37 But De Grazia does not specify how this popular belief is itself to be obtained. Thus he ig- nores the decisive differences between be- lief-systems inculcated by means of monop- oly of propaganda and suppression of oppo- sition, and those arising out of free expres- sion of different opinions. Indeed, since, from the standpoint solely of the generic function of belief-systems, the former con- tents and methods are far more efficient than the latter, it comes as no surprise to find De Grazia deploring "the mixed and conflicting systems of beliefs in contempo- rary democracies,"38 while at the same time declaring that the Nazis "outlined the cos- mic adjustment which the German people desperately needed."39 36 P. i88; my italics. 37p. 22. 38 P. 24I. 39 P. I 78.</page><page sequence="8">2i8 ETHICS PLURALISM AND THE STATE A further set of difficulties arises in De Grazia's theory from its doctrine that the preservation of the state requires the re- moval of conflicts between belief-systems. This doctrine, based perhaps on an analogy of the healthy state to the well-integrated individual and of the diseased state to the schizophrenics is elucidated by showing that in modern Western nations, particu- larly the United States, there exist two im- portant conflicts of beliefs: between the "co-operative" directive of the political and religious ideologies and the "competitive" directive of capitalism and within religion itself between the "quietist" directive of Catholicism and the "activist" directive of Protestantism. Each of these, but especially the former, gives rise to anomie. Since, how- ever, the political community, and the indi- viduals in it, essentially require co-operation in order to survive and to avoid anomie, "the competitive directive must be the one to go, for the co-operative directive can never be crushed out of men's lives."4' The competitive directive must "die . . . if man is ever to cease to act the wolf of man."42 The hortatory character of this solution has already been noted above. In the pres- ent connection, however, the most signifi- cant aspect of De Grazia's theory is the antipluralist interpretation which he gives to it. It is not, indeed, clear how far he in- tends this interpretation to extend; on this crucial point there is the same lack of clarity as on the question of the essential relation between the state and belief-systems. This much, however, is clear: he regards as quite erroneous the pluralist doctrine that there is "a great 'Society' or a great 'Community' within which the state is merely one among many morally equal groups."43 Rather, "the state is the highest secular association,"44 "the community which embraces all other communities."45 What, however, does De Grazia mean by this echo of the Aristotelian conception of 40 Cf. pp. '55, i64-65. 41 p. i88. 42 P. i87. 44 P. I90. 43 P. I9o; italics in original. 45 P. iX. the state? It is here that he ceases to be clear. He asserts, indeed, that the pluralists are Wrong in implying that "the present-day intense craving for association is part of hu- man nature, as, for example, in the remark that 'man is a creature of competing loyal- ties.' " On the contrary, "the extreme need today for the affectionate contacts of associ- ations is circumstantial."46 This last propo- sition De Grazia holds that he has proved by showing that the various types of affiliation whereby men in democratic countries today seek affection in life outside work-in ro- mantic love, friendship, the family, and voluntary associations with numerous other persons-were not valued similarly highly in earlier times and cultures.47 The reason why they are valued so highly now is that, since modern conditions of life generate anomie through conflicts in directives, these affiliations are sought in order to restore peace of mind. This account (so similar to the story of man's fall from pristine inno- cence) shows that competing loyalties, so far from being "natural" to man, are rather the conventional products of special condi- tions, for "conscience cannot develop with- out a series of unconflicting directives. Man is a creature who must avoid competing loyalties."48 The pluralist doctrines, there- fore, far from being independent insights into the essential character of man's social organizations, are themselves the effects of the anomie-generated high estimations of the value of voluntary association. The inference which De Grazia draws from this conventionalist status which he has established for pluralism seems to be this: Since plural, competing loyalties are at once causes and effects of anomie, the re- moval of anomie will remove that plurality. Specifically, if men cease to be ground be- tween competitive and co-operative direc- tives, and are able simply to co-operate, as the conditions of social life require, then they will no longer have plural, competing, let alone conflicting, loyalties. To what, then, will they be loyal? There is but one answer: the political community. And the 46 p. I53. 47 pp. I37-53. 48 pp. 153-54.</page><page sequence="9">DISCUSSION 2I9 immediate condition for such a community, and hence the immediate object of the loyalty, can be only the ruler: A political community exists among men who regard each other as brothers. But they will not think of themselves as a brotherhood until they have and avow filial love and faith for their ruler and for their God. If they have no faith in their rulers or if they allow opposing directives to sway them from the commandment of love for their fellow-men, they have no political com- munity; they have anomie.49 The difficulty in understanding this quasi-utopian conception of the state as one big happy family consists in the relation which it bears to plurality of beliefs and values. Apparently De Grazia does not mean that brotherhood in the state will re- move all such plurality but only that "rival- ry among men for monetary acquisition is not given moral encouragement.... There will always be striving for excellence in those activities which the community re- gards as honorable; is not that enough?"50 This question must be countered with an- other: Will not this striving reintroduce plural values and associations similar to, if not identical with, those which De Grazia held to be manifestations of an anomic cul- ture? And, if it does, the problem raised by the pluralist thinkers will again demand an answer. The essential point here at issue is that the basic argument of the pluralist doc- trines cannot be disposed of as simply as De Grazia has done. There were manifold voluntary associations of a private nature long before the emergence of the competi- tive directive of capitalism or of other sys- tems. Were Socrates' meetings with his friends, the gathering of students in Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, the fre- quenting of gymnasia and theaters, the for- mation of clubs in ancient Athens-were all these the effects of simple anomie? Only if anomie be defined as the felt disequilibrium of an unfulfilled need-in which case the term will be so broad as to become meaning- less. Yet-and this is the salient feature-all such associations attract to themselves 49 P. i89. 5 P. I9I. loyalties which are quite distinct from, and not reducible to, loyalty to the political community or state.5' Now the pluralist contention with regard to this situation is simply that there is such a difference be- tween the state and other forms of associa- tion and that the state must not impose its own standards upon their specific func- tions.52 It is for this reason that pluralists insist upon distinguishing between the "state" in the narrowly political sense and the society which is the context of all the several associations, the state included. Or, if the term "state" be used for the all-inclu- sive context, then a distinction must be made between its narrowly governmental phase and the others which are of a "pri- vate" character. But even in the former sense it may be recognized that the state is in some sense the "highest" association and even that men's loyalty to it will outweigh their other loyalties. But it must also be recognized that men and their values cannot simply be reduced to the political and that these other values have their own standards with which, normally, the state must not interfere. It is precisely because he ignores this basic aspect of the pluralist doctrine that De Grazia's theory on this point falls into ambiguities and dangers. In his plea for re- moval of conflicts between belief-systems he does not distinguish between conflict and independent diversity, between contrariety and multiplicity. To be sure, he asserts that "a plurality of rulers in itself does not break down the reigning ideologies" ;53 but this is because, as in the case of religious and po- litical beliefs, they not only do not conflict but function to the same co-operatively political end.54 Thus De Grazia sees no mean between conflict and coalescence. But SI Cf. Aristotle Politics v. 9. I3 I3b ff., where one of the marks of the tyrant is shown to be the prohibi- tion of such groups purporting to exist independently of the tyrant's power. This point was repeated by Egidius of Rome and other medieval Aristotelians. 52 For two recent versions of this position cf. John Dewey, The Public and Its Problems (New York, 1927), pp. 26 if.; MacIver, op. cit., pp. I92 if., 42I ff. 53 P. 47. 54 Cf. pp. 49, i88.</page><page sequence="10">220 ETHICS it is of the essence of the theory of democra- cy, at least in that version of it recognizable in this democracy, that it provides for a di- versity of interests pursued within a com- mon framework of laws and institutions which are only regulative, not constitutive, of that pursuit. The diversity stressed by the pluralists does, to be sure, require the same kind of qualification as any theory which empha- sizes a single basic concept, even if that one be multiplicity. The dangers pointed to by De Grazia's depictions of anomie are to be met only if some such process as Dewey's "search for the public" is conscientiously maintained. Otherwise, the pluralists' diver- sity may suffer the same fate as the sepa- ratisms on which the Reformation and the revolutions made their initial advances: the separation of the state from the church and of politics from religion degenerating into a separation of politics from morals, as wit- nessed in the development and practices of sovereignty; the separation of the state's absolute control from the individual through his natural rights degenerating into the doc- trine that the state has no positive concern for the welfare of the individual and must confine itself to a negative police function. But De Grazia's monistic emphasis upon the healthy state as one in which there are no competing loyalties, no ideological con- flicts, is fraught with far greater dangers, of which he does not seem to be aware. He does not seem to be impressed by the fact that the two main kinds of situation which he cites as embodying such release from conflicts are those of war ("in the army there is no conflict of directives")55 and dic- tatorship ("the National Socialists did carry out the job of ideological reformation").56 Treating these situations as modes of adap- tation to anomie, he does not ask whether the complete removal of ideological con- flicts which he desiderates can be accom- plished within the framework of a demo- cratic community. He does, indeed, declare that democracies "appear not to have the courage of their political convictions" and that the leaders of the revolutions out of 55P. 158. s6p. I79. which democratic theory emerged "were bent on breaking, not forging, many of the physical and moral chains of existent re- gimes."57 But he does not see that the tol- eration of diversity and dissent is itself one of the main moral bases of democracy and that the monism he advocates can easily lend itself to a monolithic suppression of the freedom to disagree and to be different. On this question, then, as on the others discussed above, distinctions on each side are required. The monistic position views the pluralist, with its emphasis on diversity, as involving an anarchic individualism which encourages the ideological conflicts of rapacious economic interests and of ra- cial antagonisms. The pluralist, on the other hand, views the monist as involving a totalitarian corporatism which subjects all human concerns, including those of art, sci- ence, and morals, to a single arbitrarily im- posed political standard, whether expressed in terms of the opposition of "Jew" and "Nordic" or of "bourgeois" and "proletari- an." The dangers of each reduction are clear; but, by emphasizing only the former and not the latter, De Grazia's theory incurs particularly crucial difficulties. These arise as the correlates on the axiological side of the difficulties which were seen on the side of his theory of the nature of state, for his exclusively psychological approach leads De Grazia to ignore existing institutional factors in two further respects. He does not check the monistic ideal adumbrated in his theory against the existing situations in which that ideal may be seen embodied. And he does not consider the various mech- anisms existing in the democracies which do not conform to his ideal, whereby the ten- sions and conflicts which he desires to re- move can be relieved without the dangerous monistic emphasis characterizing his own ideal. Had he allowed for such independent consideration of institutions, he would have seen that pluralism of ideals and ideologies not only is compatible with but alone secure- ly provides for the removal of basic con- flicts by means short of war.
