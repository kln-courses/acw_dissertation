<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCULPTURED QUARTZ FROG FROM THE SOUTHWEST by JENNIFER CHATFIELD Brooklyn Museum Staff In its collection of material from the Southwest, the Brooklyn Museum has a piece of stone sculpture provocative of aesthetic and scientific interest as well as considerable simple curiosity (fig. 1). It is a piece of white quartz beautifully worked in the shape of a frog. The medium, the size,1 and the workmanship are all, if not unique, at least unusual for Southwestern Indian sculpture. The form or subject of the sculpture is in no way unusual, the frog motif symbolizing rain or water being a common decorative design in several Southwestern cultures. Evidently pecking and grinding was the technique employed in working the stone. That is, a hard stone point was pressed against the pebble by blows from another hand-held stone, pulverizing the area to be indented. Finishing was probably achieved by rubbing, again with a hand-held stone, perhaps also with the aid of water, until the piece of sculpture was completely free from roughness and smooth to the touch. Nowhere was an incised line used to indicate either form or detail. The shape of the pebble when originally found may have suggested the frog form to the observer, and, again, the original shape undoubtedly contributed to the asymmetry of the final worked form, one side of the frog being definitely more bulging than the other. The body is represented as a frog usually appears, squat and fat with legs' flexed. The head, eyes, legs, and vaulted back stand out from the body of the stone as shallow, protuberant masses. These give an impression of small forms neatly contained within a larger compact form. The method of working the stone was undoubtedly arduous and time-consuming, if we assume that it was made with primitive tools. And, whatever the period of its origin, there is no reason to assume otherwise, a microscopic examination having failed to reveal evidence of the use of metal tools in working the stone. According to its original catalog card the stone frog was found somewhere in Canon de Chelly, Arizona. In 1903, Stewart Culin, then Curator of Ethnology at the Brooklyn Museum, made a collecting trip to the Southwest. While there he saw, negotiated for, and bought for the museum the collection of Charles L. Day, trader at Chin Lee, Arizona. All of the material, some 2643 museum catalog entries, was said to have come from abandoned cliff dwellings and their environs in Canon de Chelly. The quartz frog, 1. The physical measurements are: height 4", length 7Zi", width 5%", horizontal girth 1514", longitudinal girth 18%", and weight approximately 8 lbs. 1</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. View of quartz frog in the Southwestern Indian collection of the Brooklyn Museum.</page><page sequence="3">again according to the catalog card, was an item in this collection. This scant information leaves us with a considerable amount of curiosity about the piece still to be gratified. Was it originally sculptured by prehistoric occupants of Canon ,de Chelly, or was it worked within the historic period by modern Pueblo Indians who are known to have fled to the area as refugees after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680? What was its function or significance? It is hard to believe that a collector's item so uncommon as this would have gone down in a catalog with so little identifying information, and yet this is the case. Aside from the correspondence, the Day collection is mentioned again and in more detail in Culin's Report, Museum Expedition, Brooklyn Institute Museum, 1903.2 Here he says: "Having finished with the modern Navajo material I started in at last with Day's cliff-dwelling collection. It was stored in boxes and barrels, without labels or distinguishing marks. I commenced on the smaller things which were in the living room; Going over them, piece by piece, I made careful lists, keeping the objects from the same site, as identified by the Days, together. The contents of the cliff-houses proper consisted almost entirely of rubbish, broken tools, worn out sandals, frogments of cloth and bits of pottery, stuff evidently discarded as of no possible use even to the thrifty Indian. This material contained nothing with which I was not familiar. . . "Another class of objects came from the shrines or sacred depositories. These were entirely of a religious or ceremonial character. They consisted of plume sticks and similar things, such as the existing tribes put in shrines... "A third class of material was derived from interments: dessicated bodies, the so-called mummies, wrapped in feather, rabbit skin, and buckskin robes; in some instances covered with basket bowls, and accompanied with various objects which were buried with the dead." From which class of objects are we to suppose the stone frog came? Surely not the first one, "rubbish. . . stuff evidently discarded as of no possible use." The second class, "the shrines or sacred depositories," admits a possibility. And so does the third, "derived from interments." And yet why, when he gives such details as plume sticks, feather robes, and basket bowls, does he not mention the certainly unusual stone frog? And since he nowhere specifically mentions it, is it possible that it was never a part of this collection? In a search of the literature and of other museum collections, and by way of personal queries sent out to the authorities familiar with Southwestern archaeological material, no other closely similar stone sculpture has been found. As was noted earlier, the frog is a frequent Southwestern motif, and has been found painted on walls and pottery, woven into basketry designs, and even carved into other media than quartz: for example, 2.

None of these pieces is closely similar stylistically or in size to the Brooklyn Museum frog. The style is actually more reminiscent of zoomorphic sculpture from the Valley of Mexico (fig. 3). However the author does know of one other quartz sculpture of comparable size from the Southwestern area. This is the quartz seashell found by Nelson on an altar in Pueblo Largo, Galisteo Basin, New Mexico.4 Earlier in this paper it was suggested that the stone frog may not actually have come from Canon de Chelly. Stone sculpture, both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic, has been noted from other sites. Espejo, reporting on his entrada into New Mexico (1582â€”83), mentioned idols of stone and open air shrines. And stone fetishes of animals other than the frog (mountain lion, coyote, bear, etc.) are of frequent occurrence in Pueblo archaeological sites, as they are also common in present-day Pueblo ceremonial life. Kidder in "The Artifacts of Pecos," speaks of other ceremonial objects of quartz, "lightning stones," which were probably rubbed together to simulate the glow of lightning in the darkness of a kiva.5 At the Museum of Northern Arizona, Katherine Bartlett reports a single sculptured stone in frog form in the museum collection. "It, however, is carved from red sandstone and is not so beautiful."0 From the Southwest Museum M. R. Harrington writes: "We have recently acquired a sizeable stone frog, carved from scoria, about AVz inches high. This was found in southern Arizona and is probably of Hohokam origin."7 Florence Hawley at the University of New Mexico writes: "I have seen a quartz fetish of an animal (bear, I think) from Zuni, but it was small although well worked."8 Included in Harrington's letter 3.

Hodge, Director of the Southwest Museum which says: "I have not seen anything like this quartz frog. Frogs shaped from clam-like shells, sometimes inlaid with turquoise, are common in the Hohokam region of Southern Arizona, but not in the round. . . I knew Day (father and son), who did much pot-hunting in Canon de Chelly where they obtained many fine artifacts. They were not the kind to manufacture such an object as the quartz Frog, nor indeed anything else of the sort. I would regard the specimen as genuine, but as the Days kept no notes, so far as I am aware, we have Fig. 2.

At other sites, notably the prehistoric pueblo of Pecos, quartz was used ceremonially in the form of so-called "lightning stones." Stone frogs are reported from Canon De Chelly, Pueblo Bonito, Hohokam and Salado sites, and, latterly, Zuni. Nowhere, as far as the writer can ascertain, does the frog form occur in the quartz medium except in the Brooklyn Museum specimen. And yet it is said that native quartz does not occur in Canon de Chelly. Of course it is quite probable that a quartz pebble which in any way resembled a frog, sacred symbol of rain to most Southwestern peoples, would have been transported back home from wherever it was found. Who, then, carried the prized stone to the Canon? Perhaps it was a prehistoric Indian who, recognizing the form of the stone, believed or hoped it might contain power to bring rain to the parched corn fields. The stone may have been in use and not sculptured until generations later, when the religion of the community had become more formalized, focussing its attention and faith on the ritual procurement of rain. Or might it have been brought in by a Hopi or Zuni, two Pueblo groups known to have occupied the Canon in later times? The fact that the stone was worked without the aid of metal tools does not preclude the possibility of its historic origin.11 Even today some stone implements are worked by the pecking and grinding method. Other ceremonial objects collected by Culin at Canon de Chelly were later discovered by Fewkes to have "once belonged to the Asa clan, a Tanoan speaking people now domiciled in the Hopi pueblo of Sichomovi, who are known to have lived at Zuni and to have sojourned in the Canon de Chelly for several years."12 Assuming that the stone, as originally found, bore any resemblance to a frog, it is quite likely that it was immediately regarded as sacred or powerful and used as a ceremonial object for a considerable period of time before it was worked. Concretions and other odd shaped stones which may or may not bear a resemblance to revered beings are quite commonly used ceremonially among the Pueblos.

(rain priesthood of the nadir) says: ". . . stone objects from a medicine box and buckskin sacks are added to the altar until the line seems a solid mass of irregular stones, some of them very attractive."18 Earlier in the same report a frog or toad was observed to be part of the et'tone, the most sacred fetish of the rain priesthood. This sacred fetish is dual in form, one part consisting of eight hollow reeds all containing water, the largest one also housing a diminutive live toad. "Each shi'wanni. . . is the possessor of an et'tone, which is supposed to have descended directly from the shi'wanni who brought it in a basket clasped to his breast from the undermost to the outer world. . 14 Thus it would seem that the frog or toad is particularly sacred to the Zunis.13 In view of their reverence for these creatures. 13.

Kroeber states that takkya is a Zuni generic term for both frogs and toads, indicating the equivalence with which they regard the two. Kroeber, A.

Table 2, Footnote 5. 7</page><page sequence="8">might they not have found the quartz frog at Canon de Chelly when they moved in and simply appropriated it to their own use? Cushing remarked on their attitude con cerning the origin of fetishes: "Another highly prized class of fetishes are, on the contrary, [in contrast to the concretions and stones of odd shape] those which are elaborately carved, but show evidence in the polish and dark patina, of great antiquity. They are either such as have been found by the Zunis about pueblos formerly inhabited by their ancestors or are tribal possessions which have been handed down from generation to generation, until their makers, and even the fact that they were made by any member of the tribe, have been forgotten. It is supposed by the priests (a'shi-wa-ni) of Zuni that not only these, but all true fetishes, are either actual petrifactions of the animals they represent, or were such originally."16 Still another possibility of the quartz frog's origin comes to mind, suggested by further events of that summer of 1903, when Culin was collecting in the Southwest, and by the very paucity of information on the original catalog card. Culin did not spend his whole summer with the Day collection. Another notable collection which resulted from that expedition came from the pueblo of Zuni itself. As early as May first, only a week after he had mailed the now lost catalog of the Day collection, he wrote to the Director of the Brooklyn Institute: "Zuni has been desperately poor, and the people have been selling their old treasures, including even the sacred objects from the mountain shrines."17 It is common knowledge that it is exceedingly dangerous for a stranger to approach any of these Pueblo shrines. Concomitantly a Pueblo Indian would indeed be in a desperate state even to think of selling a sacred object. Not only would he recoil at the idea himself, but the possibility of the discovery of his misdeed by his people would induce the fear of dire consequences. The least of these consequences might be his being branded as a witch. In Culin's own words, "The chief crimes in their [the Zunis'] eyes are witchcraft and the selling of sacred objects to outsiders."18 And yet some of the material collected by Culin at Zuni was from these very mountain shrines. The greater part of the material was bought from Andrew Vanderwagen, a Dutch Reformed missionary at Zuni, but some of the material as well as information concerning its whereabouts was secured by Culin from two Zuni informants whom he employed intermittently, and numerous other Indians who in desperation or ignorance sold ceremonial objects from the inner rooms where they had lain forgotten or neglected.19 One of these informants was later branded a 16.

Culin and Vanderwagen were well aware of the danger of holding such property, and Vanderwagen was in constant fear of its discovery on his premises by Zunis. To ease that fear Culin offered to escort the collection to Gallup, forty miles from Zuni, even before the Brooklyn Institute had agreed to buy it! If the stone frog had been a part of this collection from Zuni, it would certainly not have been publicized. It might even have been prudently ignored in all the corre spondence, and its catalog record deliberately falsified for purposes of concealment. In 1903 one could still pot hunt in abandoned sites with permission of the property owners, but there was no such thing as permission to hunt for, purchase, pilfer, or in any way acquire objects from the sacred shrines of existing pueblos. In other words, there was no need for secrecy in reporting the collection from Canon de Chelly, an area of abandoned cliff dwellings; but there was patent need for caution in publicizing or even reporting the collection from the living pueblo of Zuni. Thus might be explained the fact that such an unusual and choice specimen as the stone frog was never mentioned in Culin's correspondence concerning his two important collections from the Southwest in 1903, and yet appears on a catalog card, filled out subsequent to his return to Brooklyn in the fall, with provenience noted as "Cliff-dwellers, Canon de Chelly, Arizona." To summarize the foregoing data, a sculptured quartz frog in the Southwestern col lection of the Brooklyn Museum was acquired in 1903 by Stewart Culin. The specimen is purported to come from one of the abandoned cliff house sites in Canon de Chelly, where, at present, there is no native quartz. These sites enjoyed a long occupation by Pueblo people in prehistoric times and, after having been abandoned, some of them were rebuilt and occupied by Hopis, Zunis, and Tanoan speaking people following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Sculptured stone occurs in other areas of the Southwest, and the frog as a motif is ubiquitous in that region. But a frog sculptured in quartz is evidently uncommon, and the one owned by the Brooklyn Museum may be the only one in existence. The frog or toad seems to be particularly sacred to the Zunis, and, as they are known to have occupied Canon de Chelly at one time, it is possible that the quartz frog is in some way associated with them. It may have been made by earlier people and discovered by the Zunis when they moved into the Canon; it may have been made at Zuni, brought to the Canon and later abandoned in some forgotten shrine, to be picked up eventually by Day; or it may have been made at Zuni and remained there until the summer of 1903, when Culin made his important collection of Zuni ceremonial material. However, any orÂ»all of these stated origin possibilities are only speculationâ€”con sidered, to be sure, but still speculation; and all that is surely known about the stone frog is that it is a fine and unusual piece of sculpture from the area of Pueblo culture in the Southwest. 9</page></plain_text>
