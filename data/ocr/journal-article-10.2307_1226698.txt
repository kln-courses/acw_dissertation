<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Constitutional Law of the "Security State" ARTHUR S. MILLER* It has become increasingly evident in recent years that the tradi- tional formulations of constitutional law and theory are in need of re-evaluation. The massive changes in the social structure of the United States since 1789 require that theory be modified to fit the facts of modern America. My purpose in this Article is to outline some of those social changes, and to suggest the modifications of constitutional theory they require. I should like to emphasize two points at the outset. First, this is an outline, and not an exhaustive development; accordingly, it is possible that a fuller exposition may necessitate qualification of some of the statements made. Even so, the main thrust would remain intact. Second, the bulk of the statements made in sections II and III are descriptive, rather than normative, and hence should not be taken as necessarily reflecting the personal values of the author. I Statements of constitutional law and theory usually assume that the formal structure of government is all that is important in de- scribing the field to be studied. However, this is at best only a half- truth. A constitution and the law which results from its interpreta- tion deal, so far as the American model is concerned, with the de- lineation of those organs of government which exert formal control over social affairs and certain minimal limitations on that control. Left unsaid, implicit at best, is a formulation of power centers which exert control in fact over decisions. Both seem to be neces- sary for a sophisticated statement of constitutional law. The basic proposition of this Article may be set out in brief terms: Governing power, both public and private, should be recog- nized in constitutional theory, and an inquiry into the decision- making process in the United States is a fruitful means of bringing about such recognition. A modernized study of constitutional law should focus on the significant decision; that is to say, it should take *A.B., Willamette University, 1938; LL.B., Stanford University, 1949; Professor of Law, Emory University.

An important decision is one which has a sig- nificant effect, direct or indirect, on the manner in which values are shaped and shared by all or a fairly large segment of people within the United States. The basic proposition includes the ne- cessity for inquiry into two complementary problems: Who makes important decisions, and What those decisions are. (The How of decisions, i.e., the motivations of individual decision-makers, will not be developed, save for a few generalized statements.)' Such an approach will enable us to pierce the facade of formal constitu- tionalism and to perceive that there are other centers of power which perform what can be called governmental functions. This Article, accordingly, will delineate the perimeter of United States constitutional law. For our purposes the United States is a combination of a Social Service and Garrison State.2 The label appropriate to this combination is the "Security State."3 By that term is meant the dual aspects of the "Welfare State," which this nation has become during the past two decades, and the "Garrison State," which this nation has in some measure approximated since the end of World War II. The Security State gets its name from the fact that the chief drives of Americans' today appear to be the demands of the individual for economic and psychic security which are subsumed under the notion of the social-service or welfare prin- ciple of government, and the demands of people generally (for 1. This is not neglected because it is irrelevant, but because no data exist which can be used with any degree of confidence. See, however, LASSWELL, POWER AND PERSONALITY (1948); SNYDER, BRUCK, AND SAPIN, DECISION-MAKING AS AN APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS (1954). 2. By the word "State" is meant the nation, not one of the forty-eight subdivisions- which are designated with an uncapitalized "s." 3. This term is none too good, but it does serve to indicate in terse form the essential features of modern government. Something broader than "Welfare State" is required, and "Security State" fills the bill as well as any label can. 4. I have tried to deal entirely in this study with questions and statements posed in terms of human beings, rather than in terms of the abstraction called "The United States of America." This is done because the verbal shorthand which personifies the State-Germany did this; Italy wants that; the United States favors X policy-can be troublesome and even dangerous. "[T]here can be no state action or reaction except as decision-makers act and react." FIJRNISS &amp; SNYDER, AN INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY 5 (1955). In like fashion, the American people, as individuals and as members of groups, have goals or values, but the U.S.A. does not. The U.S.A. is an abstraction, a construct, when one speaks of human-like capacities such as thinking, desiring, choosing, and deciding. As an abstrac- tion, it is fallacious to think that it is endowed with human characteristics. Nevertheless, it will at times be more convenient to speak of the United States as an entity.

An examination of the manner in which power is exercised is indispensable to an understanding of the important decision and of those who make it. Power is the key concept in the American decision-making process and in the study of constitutional law. Its meaning is not a settled one in the social sciences, but for present purposes the following definition will be used: Power is the ability or capacity to make decisions affecting the values of others, the ability or capacity to impose deprivations and to bestow rewards so as to control the behavior of others.5 This does not perforce imply that a person who has power need also be in possession of the abil- ity to exercise actual physical coercion over the other. The sanctions through which decisions are enforced are usually much more subtle than that. They include those of a psychological and economic nature, as well as physical controls, and can be direct or indirect.6 We are not now interested in the myriad of routine and trivial de- cisions resulting from exercises of power between individuals. Rather, our interest lies in those examples of power-exercise which result in instances of social control imposed on a relatively broad base. That base can be national, but need not be; however, it should include an important segment of the population. In sum, then, power is the capacity to exercise control over individuals by making or influencing decisions of a national scope or importance.7 As set out above, the Security State is the official institutionaliza- tion of a society which has as its aim the furtherance of the pri- mordial value of security. Dual in nature, it includes programs designed to promote individual and national security. Individual security measures make up many of the fundamentally domestic goals of Americans, while national security measures constitute the external goals. (That the two are intimately connected is ob- 5. See LAsswELL &amp; KAPLAN, POWER AND SOCIETY 75 (1950): "Power is participation in the making of decisions: G has power over H with respect to the values K if G partid- pates in the making of decisions affecting the K-policies of H." Another definition of power appears in TAWNEY, EQUALITY (1931): "[T]he capacity of an individual, or group of individuals, to modify the conduct of other individuals or groups in the manner which he desires." See RUSSELL, POWER (1938). 6. See LAPIERE, A THEORY OF SOCIAL CONTROL (1954) for a development of the vari- ous methods of controlling individual behaviour. Social control is one of the basic concepts of sociology. See also SOCIAL CONTROL (Roucek ed. 1947). 7. The problem of delimiting the "important decision" would, of course, be very difficult. To some extent, the problem is three-fold: (a) What are the important decisions? (b) With what decisions is government competent to deal? (c) With what decisions should government concern itself? 622</page><page sequence="4">THE "SECURITY STATE" vious, but often forgotten. They are separated here only for pur- poses of analysis; it should be constantly borne in mind that in- ternal and external policies of a nation are the two sides of a single coin.) The domestic aspect of the Security State is often given the label of "Welfare State" or "Social Service State"; the external fea- ture has no comparable tag, but the term "Garrison State" can be modified to fit the situation. A Social Service State is one which has as a primary function the realization of economic well-being for its inhabitants. As A. C. Pigou has said, "[T]he Welfare State [is] one that endeavors to promote the economic satisfaction of its citi- zens ... by stimulating production, improving the allocation of real income, and combating large inter-temporal fluctuations."8 To a large extent, this entails the view that government has an affirma- tive role to play: that of creating the conditions which will max- imize the opportunity for individual income-security, while at the same time assuming the responsibility for providing that income- security for those who cannot do so on their own.9 The concept of the Garrison State is not nearly so well known or extensively used as the Welfare-State label. Apparently it stems from a developmental construct which Harold Lasswell ventured in I937 and which he put into more precise statement in I94I. Ac- cording to Lasswell, a Garrison State is one "in which the special- ists on violence are the most powerful group in society.""0 How- ever, this formulation of Lasswell's requires some modification for the purposes of the present exposition; we are interested more in what the United States is today than what it might possibly become at some undetermined future time. Lasswell focused on the deci- sion-maker, but it is preferable here to emphasize the decision it- self. Hence, we shall define the Garrison State as a State in which considerations of physical security of itself and its inhabitants influ- 8.

Klaus Knorr has defined a welfare economy as "one in which the state uses public finance or direct controls for redistributing individual incomes, which have resulted from the working of the market process, in the direction of lesser inequality." Knorr, Welfare-State Measures and the Free Market in International Trade, 41 AM. ECON. REV., PROCEEDINGS 431 (1951). And Wilhelm R6pke says that the Welfare State is the fruit of a process of "institutionalization and collective organization through which provision against possible misfortune in the future is shifted further and further away from the individual and closer and closer to the public sphere of action."

The "specialists on violence," however, do not perforce create the policy; rather, they articulate it. Again, government must have an affirmative role to play: that of creating the conditions that will enhance the likeli- hood of preservation of the nation as an entity. And another refine- ment on Lasswell's statement appears necessary: a Garrison State should be carefully distinguished from a "Garrison-Police State"- a Garrison State accompanied by important measures severely re- stricting individual freedoms.1 A Garrison State need not be au- thoritarian, but may well become so. It is, in fact, one of the press- ing constitutional problems of today to find means of furthering, at one and the same time, the goals of national security and indi- vidual freedom. II. POWER EXERCISED: THE "WHO" OF DECISIONS A striking fact of the American political and economic arena has always been the wide diffusion of power. The American ideal has been to have as broad a base in decision-making as is possible. In economics, this has involved the laissez-faire notion of the role of government and the use of the market as a medium through which the numberless decisions of individual participants resulted in the operation of the American economy. In politics, and thus of course in constitutional law, the idea of the State as umpire, rather than participant, has been traditional. Power, thus, has always been decentralized in the United States, in the sense that the State was not supposed to exercise control over the entire range of im- portant decisions. Even so, power was probably centralized in the sense that some national (albeit unofficial) institution did often exercise effective control over important decisions. For example, the direction and intensity of investment depended largely upon the desires of a relatively small group of men operating in the New York money market. Hence, even though power historically has been diffused, nevertheless this did not mean that it was exercised by the mass of individuals; the majority principle was not in force. Fears of the Founding Fathers, however, were directed at the pos- sible excesses of official wielders of power only. To some extent 11. See LASSWELL, NATIONAL SECURITY AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM C. 2 (1950). OR- WELL, NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR (1949) vividly depicts the operation of a Garrison-Police State in fictional form. 624</page><page sequence="6">THE "SECURITY STATE" this is a reflection of the fact that the social environment of the times did not include power centers rivaling and competing with the State. And even if other loci of power did exist, the frontier was always available as a safety valve and an escape for the discon- tented. It is of some significance that the growth of other centers of power coincided in time roughly with the close of the American frontier. The ideal of broadly based decision-making is still prevalent, in basic myth at least, although in practice it has been greatly modi- fied. In addition to the well-known rise of the State to a position of great influence, other groups have arisen to challenge the domi- nance of the propertied and financial aristocracy. Decision-making today can be viewed through the medium of an updated analysis of the concepts of federalism and separation of powers. Attention can be directed to the important economic and political decisions, and it can be postulated that the federal system is of two types, formal and functional, and that the separation-of-powers doctrine is changing in content. Probing into the contemporary nature of these two fundamental concepts of constitutional law can help answer the question, Who exercises power in the United States? At the outset, it can be said that the American constitutional system today displays at least the following eight characteristics: I) Power (as formal authority) is divided spatially (the fed- eral system) and functionally (separation of powers). 2) The formal allocation of power in the Constitution relates only to political decisions. Left undealt with in express terms are the other important decisions, of which those of an economic nature are of particular importance. 3) The twentieth century has witnessed the growth of large semiautonomous economic organizations, called by Peter Drucker the "industrial enterprise"2 and by Adolf Berle the "corporate concentrate,"13 which are the basic units of what can be called economic federalism. The name given here for these organizations is the "factory community." 4) While orthodox theory and constitutional doctrine pre- supposed only two entities, the State and the individual person, it is today widely considered that the isolated individual does not exist as such and that he is significant only as a member of a group. 12.

July 1958] 625</page><page sequence="7">STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. io: Page 620 In addition to the large corporate enterprise, which may be thought of as including both the managerial class and the labor union,14 the new groups include farm organizations, veterans' legions, and charitable foundations, among others.15 5) Assuming that real power is formal authority conjoined with effective control,'1 it can be said that no one person or one group, however large or comprehensive, including the State, exer- cises real power over any decisional area. Rather, real power is diffused. It is shared by a congeries of groups including the State, which is probably merely the most powerful, but not necessarily the dominant, group. 6) Given this wide dispersion of power, it is important to have an arbiter among the power-wielders. Relative priorities must be assigned to articulated demands, and hierarchies among the groups must be determined. This, in essence, may well be the major role which the State plays in the American system today. 7) During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when the negative "watchguard" theory of governmental action pre- vailed, the United States Supreme Court was the principal organ of State power. Umpiring the system of formal federalism and effecting "a nexus between our fundamental law and our funda- mental economic institutions,"'7 it operated so as to formulate final policy in matters relating to political economy.l8 Today, the Su- preme Court apparently shares control of that job with Congress and the bureaucracy. 8) The most urgent problems for constitutional law and theory today are the relationship of the State and the individual to the other centers of power within the nation, and the relationship of the United States to the remainder of the world. A. The Federal System Of the formal organization of powers under the United States Constitution, perhaps the most noteworthy feature is the division 14.

Federalism as practiced in America has caught the eye of the peoples of several other nations, particu- larly those with large land areas (like Australia, Canada, and India), and is today studied carefully by those who dream about and work for the political integration of Western Europe. It is based on the assumption that the jobs of the State can be dichoto- mized and placed into separate pigeonholes, largely distinct one from the other. In the United States, at least, federalism grew to fruition when the prevailing notion was that of a strictly limited government. Since the change from the negative to the affirmative idea of the role of the State, the original conception of the federal system has undergone marked changes, not the least of which is the apparent necessity for one of the two governments to be dominant. Whatever the intention of the framers of the Constitution,19 the two governments-national and state-were roughly coequal in relative power during the formative years of the nation. Even though a series of seminal constitutional decisions by the Supreme Court gave early legal sanction for a broadly conceived exercise of national power,20 the central government was exceedingly re- luctant to intervene in social and economic affairs. The first really important change in this attitude came with the Civil War, but it was not until the late nineteenth century that national interven- tion of a nonemergency nature took place in individual activities.21 19. It may be meet to set out my attitude toward the usefulness of using the intention of the framers of the Constitution as a basis for present-day interpretation and construction. It can be summed up as follows: (1) The intention of the framers on most, if not all, of the important questions of today is probably unknowable. (2) Even if it is ascertainable, the framers' intention is apt to be of dubious relevance. (3) If it is ascertainable and it is used, it should not be considered as controlling the making of today's decisions, but, at most, as merely one of the factors to be taken into consideration-and then probably it should not be given first rank among the several factors. Those who argue for use of intention of the framers as a controlling basis for modern decision-making usually start out with a ready-made conclusion and look to history for veri- fication. If not that, they proceed on the fallacious notion that the study of history is a science and that absolute truths can be developed by its study. See FRANK, FATE AND FREE- DOM (1945). Another fallacy is, of course, the idea that words, when used, have an abso- lute and fixed meaning for all times and purposes and in all situations. By minimizing the importance of the intention of the framers in constitutional deci- sion-making, the question immediately arises of what should be the elements going into those decisions. No attempt is being made at this time to develop that important question. 20. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (U.S. 1824); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (U.S. 1819); Martin v.

The jobs of government were few in number and could be split without undue difficulty between the two systems. Since I9oo, however, the trend has been away from that conception of federalism. Although the myth still oper- ates to indicate otherwise, in actual fact the structure of formal federalism has been greatly altered. Dual federalism has become "national federalism," or better, "national cooperative federalism." The formal structure of decision-making under the Constitution, in other words, has been altered so that the national government is the dominant government in the federal system. As will be developed shortly, there has been a concurrent alteration in the traditional content of the doctrine of separation of powers. The reasons for this fundamental alteration in formal federal- ism are not difficult to locate. They are, in sum, the well-known changes which have taken place in the social and economic struc- ture of the United States, largely since 900o. They include the industrialization and urbanization of American society, the growth of rapid transportation and communication, the impact of two world wars and the great depression of the I930's, the advent of the federal income tax with the result that the bulk of the tax dollar flows to the national treasury, and the lack of fiscal independence of state governments, with their consequent inability to fulfill the demands of their constituents and still remain financially viable. These and other similar factors have coalesced to bring about the demise of dual federalism and the establishment of the new model of formal federalism. t. Formal Federalism Today Law follows society and cannot run contrary to the main streams of societal impulse and belief: Even the Supreme Court recognized this in the late I930's. Reluctant at first, refusing to believe that changes in the warp and woof of American society meant inevitable concomitant changes in all law, including con- stitutional law, the Court finally gave its imprimatur to the unify- ing forces of American society in a series of landmark decisions. Although the turning point came with the Jones &amp; Laughlin de- cision,22 the leading cases setting out the new type of federalism 22. NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 108 A.L.R. 1352 (1937). 628</page><page sequence="10">THE "SECURITY STATE" were those which upheld the Social Security Act.23 Coming shortly after Jones &amp; Laughlin, these decisions gave final constitutional approval to the outlines of cooperative federalism. Once breached, the dam has never been repaired; the trickle became a stream and then a flood. The result is that today the federal grant-in-aid is the principal means of financing the new activities of state govern- ments. State taxation systems still take care of the traditional func- tions of state and local governments, but anything new-and this includes some old but greatly expanded activities-is, by and large, involved with a federal grant or a federal subsidy.24 So far as the traditional federal system is concerned, the impli- cations of this change are clear. Chief among them is that, to a large extent, states today operate not as practically autonomous units, but as administrative districts for centrally established pol- icies. It is doubtless inaccurate to think of them as hollow political shells, but it does seem to be true that the once-powerful state governments have been bypassed by the movement of history. Save for "housekeeping" duties, they have little concern with the main flow of important decisions. When new problems arise, eyes swivel to Washington, not to the state capitol-where eyes also turn to the banks of the Potomac. It is undoubtedly accurate to say that states do exercise a great deal of control over individuals-in fact, much more today than during the nineteenth century-but never- theless, that control is mostly in matters of relatively minor or purely local importance, or, more significantly, it is exercised in the administration of policies centrally established. The transcend- ent issues get national attention and national resolution. In areas of major public concern the decision-making process has been nationalized so far as formal authority is concerned, our people apparently not being willing to tolerate fragmentation of policy in those areas. The problems of government today-broadly, social service domestically, national security externally--are believed to be beyond the powers of the individual states to grapple with ef- fectively. The demands which the American people are making today can be satisfied only through the promulgation of policies 23. Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619, 109 A.L.R. 1319 (1937); Steward Mach. Co. v.

And that means that the national government must be the chief policy-making organ of formal gov- ernment; it must be the one to promulgate and place the stamp of officiality upon decisions of more than mere local importance. This basic alteration in formal federalism was noted by Harold Laski about twenty years ago. "[T]he Federal form . . .," he said in 1939, "is unsuitable to the stage of economic and social develop- ment that America has reached . . . . I infer .. .that the epoch of federalism is over."25 Since that observation, it has become clear that federalism as traditionally known is indeed on the decline. As Karl Lowenstein has stated: "Experience . . . demonstrates that, whatever strength of tradition and emotional values of po- litical theory federalism is still imbued with, the economic impera- tives of the technological state require unified if not uniform eco- nomic policies throughout the entire territory and do not brook that kind of economic fragmentation which goes with effective member-state sovereignties."26 It should be noted, however, that this is by no means widely accepted; it is disputed today by many who appear to find elements of strength in federalism.27 But if they are correct, if there is strength in the federal system, then it is displayed in far different ways from what it was historically. Assertions to the contrary belong more to the category of pious hope or yearning for a bygone age than statements of fact. Fed- eralism, in its former sense of true dual government, is no longer possible in the age of the Security State. The formal structure of American government will doubtless remain, but only as a facade behind which the great changes which have taken place are hidden. The fundamental changes in formal federalism are only part of the picture of the division of power between governments. In addition, and probably of far greater importance, there is the con- current growth of "functional federalism." This, in short, en- compasses the dimension of a system of "private governments" existing within the United States of America. 25.

Functional Federalism Orthodox constitutional theory and doctrine recognize the existence of but two entities: government and the individual per- son. Nothing intermediate is envisaged. The Constitution limits government in favor of individuals, a notion based on the unstated assumption that individuals live and act as autonomous units. Not even the political party is mentioned in the Constitution, and it is only through a sometimes disputed construction that artificial persons are included within the scope of the constitutional indi- vidual.28 That concept, of course, is a reflection of the philosophi- cal ideas current in the eighteenth century, ideas of both a political and an economic nature which can be usefully summed up in what has been called the Protestant Ethic. Max Weber's hypothesis, popularized to some extent by Tawney, of the close connection between the rise of capitalism and the burgeoning of Protestantism is the classic statement of the Protestant Ethic.29 A basic tenet of this concept is that of individualism, both political and economic, an individualism which later got its prophets (and apologists) in such writers as Adam Smith, Ricardo, Locke, John Stuart Mill, William Graham Summer, and Herbert Spencer, among others. As outlined by these and other commentators, the Protestant Ethic extolled the sacredness of property, decried the spiritually debili- tating effects of security, and asserted the supreme virtues of hard work, thrift, and independence.30 But it has become widely recognized in the past few decades that the completely autonomous, "isolated" individual does not exist as such. The individual spends his life as a member of groups and is significant only as a member of a group. The Protestant Ethic has been replaced by what William H. Whyte, Jr., has called the "Social Ethic," defined in the following way: .... By Social Ethic I mean that contemporary body of thought which makes morally legitimate the pressures of society against the indi- 28.

Its major propositions are three: a belief in the group as the source of creativity; a belief in "belongingness" as the ultimate need of the individual; and a belief in the application of science to achieve the belongingness.81 The Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, American so- ciety is not composed of atomistic individuals operating as such. For the individual, the group provides an apparatus for the escape from anomy by persons who are beset, as many modern social scientists insist is the general rule, with feelings of isolation, of nothingness, of rootlessness and purposelessness.32 It also enables individuals to increase and strengthen their freedom and liberty. This seeming paradox is explained by the theory that through union, persons may accomplish objectives which they as individuals would be unable to achieve and may also oppose the coercive tactics of other and stronger individuals or associations.33 For society, on the other hand, voluntary groups and associations are a means by which some of the urgent business of society is performed. They are agencies of social control, operating as arms of the State in the performance of some of the preferred activities of society. They may be considered to be the recipients of delegated power from the State.34 This is not new in history; it has apparently always been so. Compare in this regard the following statements: .... As Aristotle said centuries ago, the isolated individual could not exist except as a stone hand. The lone individual does not figure either in family relations, in neighborhood relations, in state relations, in social relations, or in the higher values of religion. Nowhere is he left without guiding social groups, personalities, and principles.85 .... This great fact stands out clearly, that through the centuries -down until our own day-group interests were recognized as forming the very essence of politics both in theory and practice.86 This is fast becoming a truism among philosophers, political scientists, and sociologists, among others. John Dewey, for ex- ample, maintained that the individual achieves his meaning only 31. WHYTE, THE ORGANIZATION MAN 5 (1956). 32.

And John R. Commons put it even more tersely: "This is an age of collective action."40 But legal theorists have, for the most part at least, lagged behind. While the concept of the group has received express recognition in virtually all of the social sciences, most American legal com- mentators have doggedly continued to assume that Maine's dictum about the movement of progressive societies being from status to contract still had operational validity." In constitutional law, how- ever, governmental sanction and approval has been given to group and associational activities. While speaking in the symbols of individualism, the Supreme Court has by indirection created a constitutional law of freedom of association.42 Congress has legis- 37.

Freedom, though it has brought him independence and rationality, has made him isolated and, thereby, anxious and powerless. This isolation is unbearable and the alternatives he is confronted with are either to escape from the burden of this freedom into new dependencies and submission, or to advance to the full realization of positive freedom which is based upon the uniqueness and individuality of man."

Constitutional theory should now recognize an entity intermediate between the individual and the State: the group- the basic unit of functional federalism, the wielder of effective control in fact over large parts of the American power system. The late John R. Commons once observed, in a statement rele- vant to the idea of functional federalism, that "the 'modern state,' or 'political power' . . . is increasingly focused upon the delega- tion of power to administrative commissions whose members are officials of government, while the 'new economic state,' or 'eco- nomic power,' is the corresponding delegation of power to private corporations whose officials are the boards of directors."" We speak now of the exercise of power in the sense of making the myriad decisions necessary to spell out a pre-existing policy established by superior authority. We speak thus of administered capitalism, to use Adolf Berle's concept,45 or of the "delegated power of com- mand,"46 to quote Karl Renner, and our attention is on the organs to which the State has entrusted the performance of some of its essential functions. I do not mean to focus upon the administra- tive agency, but upon the recipient of economic power-the large corporate enterprise or factory community-probably the most im- portant of the groups in American society. These are the func- tional units of economic federalism and the basic units of a system of private governments. Just as the national government must entrust the administra- tion of its national economic and social programs to the state and local officials, so it can be said that private entities are entrusted with the performance of their important societal functions. This can, with Commons, be called a delegation of power without doing undue violence to normal terminology or established doctrine.47 43.

In addi- tion to the usual problems reaching judicial decision, for an account of which see DAVIS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW C. 2 (1951), there are many other delegations of authority which get little or no mention.

"8 But the label placed on it is unimportant.49 What is important is the existence of the factory community as an entity- in Kenneth Carlston's term, a "structure of social action"-which, ostensibly private, in fact performs functions of a public govern- mental nature.50 This system of private governments can be said to comprise the structure of economic federalism, or of functional federalism, as distinguished from formal (political) federalism. A half-century ago, Woodrow Wilson maintained that "the ques- tion of the relation of the States to the federal government is the tutional law. Delegations to private groups have, however, been litigated on a few occasions. Id. § 21. But the really important delegations have not been litigated as such; in fact they are not called delegations at all. See Berle, The Developing Law of Corporate Concentra- tion, 19 U. Cn. L.

If granted, the privilege is conferred in order to achieve an end which the State deems desirable." Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee, 288 U.S. 517, 545, 85 A.L.R. 699, 713 (1933).

How far the pendulum has swung since Munn may be indicated by a statement made by Henry Luce in 1957: "The radical doctrine I hold is that all business is invested with a public interest." Luce, The Character of the Businessman, Fortune, Aug. 1957, pp. 108-9. Luce was not of course recommend- ing that all business be treated as a public utility by government, but rather that the businessman had a duty to adhere to certain standards of conduct and social responsibility. The editors of Fortune, in USA-THE PERMANENT REVOLUTION 88 (1951), averred that "ownership carries social obligations, and . . . a manager is a trustee not only for the owner but for society as a whole." 49. To the primitive mind, the end of inquiry is to categorize something and place it into a pigeonhole. This is often done by making reference to an available set of labels, one of which is chosen and placed on the new object or new concept. But classifications are, of course, useful aids to thinking and to knowledge, not ends in themselves. Lawyers and economists, as Commons has demonstrated, can be talking about exactly the same thing, while using different words and symbols, and find themselves unable to communicate with each other.

Sovereignty, in other words, is not unitary, Bodin to the contrary notwithstanding. Pluralism, it can be said, is the operative political fact of American society.53 And this is the American brand of collectivism. The pluralism, in addition, can probably be thought of as the pluralism of elites-the leaders of the groups which make up society and exercise sovereignty.6' Taking the factory com- munity as the most important of these groups, it is to be noted that the impact which that community makes upon the allocation of resources, the level and distribution of income, the rate of economic development, and the price system has been examined by a grow- ing number of analysts.65 In addition, a number of observers have remarked on the essentially governmental character of the activi- ties carried on by the factory community.5 Illustrative is Adolph Berle, who has devoted many years to the study of the modern corporation and its implication for democ- racy: "The modern corporation plainly lies in that no-man's land where economics, law, and political science converge; and it is 51.

See MILLS, THE POWER ELITE (1956), criticized in Parsons, The Distribution of Power in American Society, 10 WORLD PoLITICs 123 (1957). Mills's central thesis is the contention that there has developed a concentration of power in the hands of a small, rela- tively tightly integrated group of people. One need not subscribe wholeheartedly to that thesis, particularly as it tends to become a "conspiracy" theory; nevertheless, the book can be studied with profit. 55.

In economics, it is the hub around which the economy revolves; it is the key unit. Not the individual, but a collectivity which by legal legerdemain is con- sidered in law to be an individual, is the basis of the national eco- nomic structure. The abstraction to replace "economic man" is the modern factory community. Peter Drucker puts it this way: "The abdication of individual property rights as a basis of social power is the central institutional change of our times."69 And further that the representative social phenomena of the industrial system of our time are the mass-production plant and the corporation.60 Eco- nomic society embodies what Kenneth Boulding has called "the organizational revolution""6 and it includes what J. K. Galbraith has termed the "concept of countervailing power."62 The American system is one of giants, and will continue to be so despite the anti- trust laws. The individual does not exist as an important entity in the economic picture-and perhaps not even in the political pic- ture. Replacing him has been the organization, if, indeed, it has not always been so. It takes no fanciful mental gymnastics to say that the factory community operates as the recipient of delegated power to carry out important societal functions.63 It is the economic counterpart- and superior, be it said-of the unit of political federalism, the forty-eight state governments.4 It is the basic unit of functional federalism. It is a private governmental system, performing some of the jobs of government. "As far as we can observe," says Berle, 57.

It en- genders loose relationships between these organizations, usually for the purpose of stabilizing or apportioning the markets."65 Economic federalism thus exists as a patent fact of modern American political life. Of course, the units of this system are not as clearly defined as are the units of political federalism. They are not geographically delimited; rather, they are functionally organ- ized. They are far more amorphous than the units of political fed- eralism, and call for focus on the decisions which are made by the group in order to ascertain their importance. They are the decision- makers for a decentralized system of decision-making. They are the units of "neofeudalism."66 As such, they tend to be far more viable and autonomous than are the states, which by and large follow the lead set out by central authority. And they raise real problems about their relationship to the State, problems of control, problems of how to limit the exercise of power. Before taking up that question, however, some attention should be devoted to the delineation of the nature of the State (i.e., government) itself under a modern view of constitutionalism. This can be done by develop- ing the doctrine of separation of powers as it exists today. B. Separation of Powers If for purposes of this discussion we equate the State with the formal structure of the national government,67 then it can readily be seen that massive changes have taken place, and will probably continue to take place, in the manner in which decisions are made within government. The State illustrates the same type of differ- ences between formal authority and effective control in the exer- cise of power which were outlined above in the discussion of mod- ern federalism. The Constitution sets up a government system, but 65. Id. at 77. 66. The associations which make up our organizational society are, of course, organ- ized within themselves in a hierarchy of power. Striking parallels can be drawn between the units of historical feudalism and the burgeoning system of neofeudalism. The com- parison is, to be sure, not exact, but is close enough to raise serious questions of individual freedom in an age of collectivities. This is discussed in brief form in section IV infra. The reasons for the rise and decline of the concept of individualism have never been satisfactorily explained. However, the world frontier hypothesis of Walter Prescott Webb may provide a clue, even though Webb merely hints at the use of his hypothesis for such an end. Webb points out the coincidence in time of the rise of individualism with the open- ing of the colonial empires and the fact that individualism began to lose ground about the time of the closing of the world frontier.

The I789 model of a tripartite division of governmental powers has been giving way to what approaches a bipartite division and what threatens to be- come even more streamlined. Both the judiciary and the legisla- ture have waned in their positions of relative power. This loss of power has been accompanied by a corresponding growth of rela- tive power in the executive (including the administrative) branch of government. These changes can be summed up in four propo- sitions: I) The role of the Supreme Court in the national government has undergone a marked change in the past twenty years. The thrust of its power is more in interpretation of the legislative and executive will than as an aristocratic censor through constitutional construction. 2) The bureaucracy has taken on a much more important posi- tion in the power hierarchy than it held historically. It can validly be termed a fourth branch of government. 3) It has proved to be necessary for basic policy decisions to be made outside the formal, i.e., constitutional, allocation of govern- mental powers. 4) The executive, i.e., the President and his immediate office, has taken an increasingly important role in the formulation of State policy. A little over three decades ago a perspicacious observer could call the Supreme Court "the first authoritative faculty of political economy in the world's history";68 and a little less than three dec- ades ago a tract entitled Government by Judiciary was published.69 Today that Court and the relative position of the third branch of government has either declined markedly in power or has so changed its role that its policy-making activities are not so obvious. In questions of political economy and social welfare, the basic pol- icy prescription is legislative; the judiciary fills the interstices left by Congress in its enactments. The spate of civil-libertarian deci- sions in the past two years indicates, however, that the Supreme Court is something more than an adjunct of Congress.70 With the 68.

It no longer occupies the lofty position of aristo- cratic censor of the passions of the multitude; within the national government, much of its work deals with statutory, not constitu- tional, interpretation. Outside the central government, however, with respect to the relationships of the federal system and in en- larging the zone of officiality, the Court's traditional role is more manifest. In many of its relations to Congress, the executive, and the bu- reaucracy, the Supreme Court's ostensible power of judicial control now must be exerted through less obvious channels-if it is to be done at all. Otherwise, the trend, discernible to some observers, of judicial deference may well continue.71 In this view, possibly even the rash of civil-liberties and civil-rights decisions in I956-58 con- stitute a last struggle of a once-powerful governmental organ be- fore succumbing to the pressing exigencies of the Security State.7 On the other hand, there are other commentators (such as, for ex- ample, Professor Kurland)73 who maintain that the alleged loss of power by the Court is illusory. To these commentators, the Court is now, and will continue to be, far more than a mere conduit through which pass the predigested policies of the other branches of government. Moreover, as Willard Hurst has put it, "the really important area of judicial contribution to policy-making is in the field of the interpretation of statutes."74 With the American power process as it is, with the State not supremely dominant but only the most important societal group, a Court decision in statutory in- terpretation will often stick, even in the face of cries of outrage."7 (1957); Watkins v.

Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956), unless it is true that the Court's decisions in statu- tory interpretation are considered to be extremely difficult, and often impossible, to alter by congressional act. 640</page><page sequence="22">THE "SECURITY STATE" Without adhering to either side of this controversy, it can be said that ultimate power in policy formation appears to rest outside the judiciary and that the Supreme Court operates in narrower, more canalized areas of maneuver than it did historically.76 And so far as civil-libertarian matters are concerned, it remains to be seen whether the Court's resurgence of activism will set a perma- nent pattern. In other words, it is not yet clear that a Welfare State, in an age of mass democracy, will permit an essentially oli- garchic institution to set basic policy.77 It can be said that, in final analysis, a major role of the Supreme Court vis-a-vis other branches of the central government will be that of effecting an adjustment between the deliberately broad statements of policy enunciated by the State (in this case, Con- gress) and the infinitely detailed realities of industrial and com- munity life. Examples of this role would include the antitrust laws, which may be viewed as legislative prescriptions of broad gen- erality which establish fundamental policy but which leave to the federal courts the responsibility for spelling them out and applying them to particular factual situations,7 and the federal labor laws. In this status, possibly the Court is "the most continu- ously active and influential faculty of political theory in the coun- try."79 Whether that is accurate or not, it does appear to be true that the job of the Court, within the central government, has been changing toward interpretation of the legislative will. Within the federal system, one of its main responsibilities is that of defining the nature of "the collectivity of our time."80 The second and fourth characteristics of the modern version of 76. Examples of where Congress is able now to overrule the Supreme Court are available. See Caron v. Roane-Anderson Co., 342 U.S. 232 (1952), overruled by 67 STAT. 575, 42 U.S.C. §2208 (Supp. III, 1953); the litigation and subsequent legislation con- cerning the "tidelands," United States v. Texas, 339 U.S. 707 (1950); United States v. Louisiana, 339 U.S. 699 (1950); United States v. California, 332 U.S. 19 (1947), overruled by 67 STAT. 29 (1953), 43 U.S.C. § 1311 (Supp. I, 1954), and the legislation following the Supreme Court decision in Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957), modified by 71 STAT. 595, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3500 (Supp. 1957). Similar legislative action is possible with regard to Hanson, Nelson, and numerous other cases of statutory construction. In these two last-named cases, however, the exigencies of American politics would make it difficult to alter the judicial result. See, e.g., Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 18-21 (1957), where Con- gress must accommodate itself to the judicial pronouncement. 77. Perhaps the acid test of that generalization will come in the final resolution of the segregation cases. I am inclined to think that a careful study of Supreme Court deci- sions, both those which have invalidated acts of legislatures and those which have affirma- tively construed constitutional terms as in the segregation cases, would show that the Court has never been long out of phase with the controlling elements of American society. 78.

Within the executive branch proper, and within the "headless fourth branch of government," is located the nerve center of the American State today. The vast bulk of routine decisions are made administratively, including many of very great importance to the individuals immediately and directly affected. Operating on broad delegations of authority from Congress, the adminis- trators have a high degree of flexibility (not always used) and only nominal supervision from other branches of government. Defer- ence to the legislature by the Supreme Court has included defer- ence to the creatures of Congress: the administrative agency and the government department.82 Some restraints do exist in the threat of judicial review, but it is a fact of modern life that only a microscopic number of administrative decisions are reviewed by the federal courts.83 Even fewer are overturned. So far as Congress is concerned, the pattern is not so clear, but it seems to be true also that congressional supervision of administrative decision is nominal at best, and nonexistent in many instances. And with regard to the President, it can be said that his is not a position of power dominance over the bureaucracy, but that he exercises "great in- fluence" over some of the decisions therein made.84 The fourth branch of government, headless or not, is in its seemingly infinite complexity a fact of life today and an exerciser of considerable power in the governmental decision-making process. 81. Parkinson's Law deals with the irresistible tendency of the bureaucracy to expand. PARKINSON, PARKINSON'S LAW, AND OTHER STUDIES IN ADMINISTRATION (1957). 82. The deference accorded to the administrator may well be greatly exaggerated. There are growing indications that the pendulum is swinging the other way, as more and more commentators ask searching questions about the administrative process. See, e.g., Schwartz, Legal Restriction of Competition in the Regulated Industries: An Abdication of Judicial Responsibility, 67 HARV. L. REV. 436, 473-74 (1954); Parker, Why Do Ad- ministrative Agencies Exist? A Reappraisal, 45 GEo. L.J. 331 (1957); Schwartz, Congres- sional Oversight: Control of Administrative Agencies, 43 A.B.A.J. 19 (1957). 83. Some statistics are gathered in GELLHORN &amp; BYSE, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW 61 (1954). Of course, the number of times judicial review is invoked bears little relation to the influ- ence which a particular decision by a court may have on the bureaucracy. Nevertheless, on the whole judicial control of administration is more theoretical than real. 84. This is the conclusion reached by Gellhorn and Byse. Id. at 169. A relevant ques- tion to ask is whether the chief executive is, partially or otherwise, a "prisoner of his staff." Even if he does enter into the decision-making process, how far is his personal view influ- enced or controlled by the manner in which the question is presented to him by the staff? 642</page><page sequence="24">THE "SECURITY STATE" Whatever the framers visualized as the office of the presidency,85 the Chief Executive seems to be emerging as the strongest of the three traditional branches of government. As Corwin has put it, "taken by and large, the history of the Presidency is a history of aggrandizement, but the story is a highly discontinuous one."86 Try as some might to avoid the tasks of governing and of leader- ship, today's insistent problems do not allow it. We can even agree with Justice Black's poorly conceived opinion in the Steel Seizure Case87 and say that only Congress can set policy; but even so, this does not eliminate the need for the President pointing the way for required policies and working to get them enacted. The schoolboy version of government, with three watertight compartments, does not meet the pressing needs of the mid-twentieth century. A nation thrust into world leadership and beset by a continuing series of crises requires a government that takes affirmative steps to meet those crises. To do that, leadership is necessary, leadership which in the constitutional system only the President can furnish. A tri- partite division of constitutional power into three roughly equal branches has thus had to fall before the demands of an industrial society and a shrinking planet. Separation of powers and the formal structure of policy-making within the national government has been supplanted by the insti- tutionalization of an informal system cutting across the executive, administrative, and legislative branches. The picture is blurred and it is difficult to get into focus, but it is contended here that the really important decisions made within the Government are taken by a relatively small group of men: the President and his closest advisers; the leaders of Congress, particularly the Senate; and the administrators directly interested in the decision to be made. This can, I think, be called decision-making by a high-level committee with a shifting membership. Were it not so invidious in its con- notations, such a committee might well be called a supra-constitu- tional "camarilla" or "junta." To some extent, this group has been given a legal basis in the creation of the National Security Council. For decisions relating to external policy, this seems to be fairly evident: the President and Secretary of State are often only formally 85. See CORWIN, THE PRESIDENT: OFFICE AND POWERS C. 1 (4th ed. 1957), for a dis- cussion of the various conceptions of the office of the presidency. 86. Id. at 29-30. 87.

At some point, congressional leaders are brought into the picture and their advice sought, the lesson of Henry Cabot Lodge and his "little group of wilful men" and the League of Nations having driven home to the administrators the vital neces- sity of not eliminating the legislature from participation.88 The congressional leaders, in addition, are able to assess and report on the temper of their colleagues in the legislature, who will in turn have assessed the temper of the influential groups in American society. For the decision, when made, often requires subsequent ratification by Congress: that is to say, it is then referred to Con- gress for action. Only Congress can make a law or a policy, or so the Constitution says and so the Supreme Court would have us believe. So the matter goes to "The Hill" for the ritual of discussion and final affixing of the imprimatur of officiality. The form is preserved, while at the same time allowing for the urgent business of government to get done. The result is that despite constitutional provision to the con- trary, the broad official statements of national policy in the field of economic and social affairs, as in external relations, are often made by a small group of men acting as a unit superimposed on the constitutional system. A strong case can be made for the prop- osition that government by "junta" is a cardinal fact of mid-twen- tieth century America.89 But even if that is granted, it must im- mediately be added that this emphatically does not mean that the group of men can, or does, act without regard for the demands of the people generally. What has been said above simply relates to a statement of who makes decisions in the national government, 88. In ACHESON, A CITIZEN LOOKS AT CONGRESS (1957), there may be found a de- velopment of the trials and tribulations an administrator faces when dealing with Congress, and, more important, the inflexibility in external policy which Congress imposes on a Secretary of State. See also STANLEY, AMERICAN DEFENSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 38-44 (1956), and the series of articles appearing in 30 Soc. SCI. No. 4 (Oct. 1955). 89. Admittedly, the word "junta" usually connotes a different state of affairs than that described in the text; the word is often associated with revolutionary governments. Never- theless, it does seem to be a handy term for use in labelling decisions reached by high-level committees with shifting memberships. Accounts of decision-making so carried out have not, to my knowledge, been the subject of systematic study. See Lindblom, In Praise of Political Science, 9 WORLD POLITICS 240 (1957). See also DONOVAN, EISENHOWER: THE INSIDE STORY (1956), and SHERWOOD, ROOSEVELT AND HOPKINS: AN INTIMATE HISTORY (1948) for accounts by journalists of the operation of government at the highest level. Biographies and autobiographies of leading political figures also contain much of interest; as, for example, those of Stimson, Forrestal, Hull, and Ickes.

It says nothing of how decisions are made by the men them- selves. Deferring that perplexing topic temporarily, it can be said simply at this time that the decision-makers take into account not only what in fact the "people" generally are demanding but also what, in their judgment, the "people" will go along with.90 They operate, in other words, in the milieu of modern mass democracy, which in turn appears to be made up of a congeries of groups. The will of the "people" can be considered to be a myth, but the national government is not free to issue a decree at will. Furthermore, as De Tocqueville observed, "when the central government . . . has issued a decree, it must entrust the execution of its will to agents over whom it frequently has no control and whom it cannot per- petually direct."9' C. The Role of Government in a Pluralistic Society Our discussion of the place which the State plays in the decision- making process takes two avenues: first, the position of government as one of the groups in society, and second, the role of each of the units of government. We will examine each concurrently, in order to see the interplay which takes place. The propositions which will be ventured below include the following: I) The State is but one of the many groups which make up the pluralistic nature of American society. 2) However, there may be what has been called a "reserve function" of the State which enables it, during times of emergency, to be the dominant group. 3) Policies are made through a complex process of group inter- action, often but not necessarily resulting in official sanction being given by the State. 4) Policies enunciated by the national government tend to represent a consensus of the groups most affected by such policies. 5) The organs of government have specialized functions to play in the process of group interaction, functions which complement 90. "In conclusion, we might summarize our comments on the nature of choice as follows: information is selectively perceived and evaluated in terms of the decision-maker's frame of reference. Choices are made in the basis of preferences which are in part situa- tionally and in part biographically determined."

Chief among the groups are the factory communities. A few years ago, advocates of pluralism pleaded for more recognition of the social groups within the State . . in mitigation of the legal and ideological glorification of the State. A generation later, the question must be raised in all seriousness whether the "overmighty subjects" of our time-the giant corporations, both of a commercial and non-commercial character, the labor unions, the trade associations, farmers organizations, veterans legions, and some other highly organized groups-have taken over the substance of sovereignty.92 Just what is the relationship of the State to the other groups in society ? We begin with a quotation: "A central guiding thread of American constitutional development has been the evolution of a political system in which all the active and legitimate groups in the population can make themselves heard at some crucial stage in the process of decision."93 The formation and establishment of important policies in the United States appears to require the reaching of a consensus among those groups most affected, bene- ficially or adversely, by those policies. As a result, it can be said that policies tend to become those sanctioned by the lowest com- mon denominator among interest groups. They tend to be those which strike a balance between pleasing the most people and of- fending the least number. Put in another way, this means that the State is not all-powerful; it cannot operate as it wishes, it cannot fail to take into serious consideration the demands and wishes of the units of our organizational society. National decision-making, i.e., the power of government, in final analysis is an amalgam of the aspirations of the State as watered down by the influence of the units of neofeudalism. "The problems of industrial society are . . . problems in pluralist organization. There is not one prime mover in our society but at least two: State and enterprise. These two have to live in harmony or they will not live at all."9" The late Justice Robert H. Jackson said that whenever any organization or combination of individuals . . .

Liberty requires that coercion be applied to the individual not by other individuals but by the Government after full inquiry into the justification.95 As a statement of preference, there is little to quarrel with in that statement. But as a statement of fact, it may be seriously questioned. As one-and only one-of the groups which make up American society, the State has a specialized role to play. It has to compete with the other social groups for the allegiance and obedience of the individual; but it also commands a special type of allegiance and it may be able to call upon what has been called a "reserve function of the State" during times of emergency. Historically, government had a role wholly negative in nature, one which aimed not at the promulgation of policies peculiar to the State but at the establishment of conditions which would allow for the maximum choice to be made by the discrete elements of society. The courts provided a forum for the settlement of disputes between these elements which could not be settled through their own resources. The legislative process was largely concerned with providing aid to the burgeoning industrial system of America, either through tariffs to minimize foreign competition or through direct grants, as with the land grants to railroads. Little attempt was made to place restraints on individual effort, other than the minimal restrictions necessary for police protection. The change in bent of government began roughly at the time of the closing of the American frontier.96 With no more largess to dispense and with the continent subdued, the problem of gov- ernment became one of supervising the allocation of resources within the nation. Government affirmatively intervened in the flow of social and economic affairs, at the behest of groups which were able to enlist the aid of the official group. But with affirmative action came the growth of government with its own interests to further, the result being that it vied for dominant participation with other important groups in the national decision-making process. For some time, the unofficial groups which had been making the important societal decisions were able to invoke the 95. JACKSON, THE SUPREME COURT IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT 69 (1955).

But that ended when pent-up forces broke loose during the I930's, when individuals were no longer wholly subject to the whim and caprice of private decisions which vitally affected their interests. For better or for worse, they were now able to enlist the power of the State to oppose private power and through the rise of new power groups to lessen the influence of the exercise of private decision-making upon the entire body politic. This did not mean, however, that the State supplanted entirely the system of private decision-making. "Statism," as of now at any rate, is a bogeyman erected by those who do not like the new private power centers, such as labor unions. What it did mean, however, was that private decision-makers had to take government demands into account; and often these demands have had a significant influence upon those private decisions. On the other hand, the demands of the State could not be arbitrary or unrealistic, for the power position of the other groups in society had to be reckoned with. Government, in Galbraith's term, became a "countervailing force" in American society, a force which "establishes the norms of permissible behavior in group relations and enforces these norms.""97 And, be it said, the new role of the State called for a "new look" at the theory and doctrine of constitutional law; the interaction of group behavior patterns required an analysis of the entire decision-making process. The sovereignty "of the people" being in fact the sovereignty of groups, decision-making is the result of the interaction of these groups. It is a mistake to think, as C. Wright Mills has done,98 that national policies are oligarchically made; at best, the oligarchy -the group leaders-merely puts the final formal approval on a decision. Decisions are the result of struggle in the political arena among groups, of which the official group, the State, is but one type. Earl Latham has put it well: The group struggle . . . is apparent in the universe of unofficial groups and it is apparent in the universe of official groups. But these are not separate universes. They are one. Official groups are inhabitants of one pluralistic world. That world is an aggregation, a collection, an assemblage, a throng, a moving multitude of human clusters . . . a 97.

The resultant decisions, representing the consensus of affected groups, is the source of the difficulty decried by Walter Lippmann in The Public Philosophy.'00 The true national interest, or what Lippmann calls the Public Interest, is only accidentally served by such a process of decision-making.101 Early in American history the dominant groups were the mer- cantile and the aristocratic landholding classes, save only for an occasional displacement, as in the administration of President Jack- son, by the farmers and artisans. The Constitution itself has been thought of as the product of the pressures brought by those classes.102 Whether it was or not, certainly the pattern of official decision-making during the first century of American constitu- tional history clearly favored those groups. Astute use of the inter- state commerce clause by Chief Justice John Marshall cut away any likelihood of adverse state regulation; at the same time, the national government showed no inclination to enact affirmative commercial regulations. After the Civil War, other groups arose to challenge the political supremacy of the business ruling-class. The Granger movement, the Populist movement, the trade union movement all reflected a growing ferment in politics and a growing participation in local decision-making by formerly dormant groups. By I900 the domi- nant position of the business leadership had been threatened and breached. More and more the other societal groups demanded an opportunity to make their weight felt in decisions. The new groups soon found that their balloting power gave them control of the state and even the national legislatures. The trend toward social equality prophesied by De Tocqueville in Democracy in America was coming true. For a number of years the former dominant group was able to combine with the federal judiciary and stave off the impact of most of the decisions made by the new combinations 99.

The result has been succinctly stated by David Riesman: The [legislative] lobby in the old days actually ministered to the clear leadership, privilege, and imperative of the business ruling class. Today we have substituted for that leadership a series of groups, each of which has struggled for and finally attained a power to stop things conceivably inimical to its interests and, within far narrower limits, to start things. The movie-censoring groups, the farm groups and the labor and professional groups, the major ethnic groups and major regional groups, have in many instances succeeded in maneuvering themselves into a position in which they are able to neutralize those who might attack them. The very increase in the number of these groups, and in the kinds of interests "practical" and "fictional" they are protecting, marks therefore, a decisive change from the lobbies of an earlier day .... These veto groups are neither leader-groups nor led-groups. The only leaders of national scope left in the United States today are those who can placate the veto groups. The only followers left in the United States today are those unorganized and sometimes disorganized unfortunates who have not yet invented their group.103 This concept of "veto groups" is of basic importance. It is the method by which a consensus is reached among the groups of the polity. This consensus is, as we have stated above, representative of the least common denominator among affected groups. Or, as Earl Latham puts it, "what may be called public policy is the equilibrium reached in [the group] struggle at any given mo- ment . . 104 The term "veto group" may be somewhat unfortunate. Often a group cannot "veto" something "conceivably inimical to its in- terests." The bald statement of Riesman's quoted above, taken literally, would mean that no decision of any importance to more than one group within the United States could be promulgated today. The concept of veto groups is, in essence, negative in that it is difficult for any one group to force an affirmative policy on the nation. More important, however, it means that veto groups must, to be effective, join and act in concert. To put it another way, power in the United States is diffused. Riesman recognizes this, but does not emphasize it, when he says that "power in America seems to me situational and mercurial; it resists attempts to locate it the way a molecule, under the Heisenberg principle, resists at- 103.

LATHAM, THE GROUP BASIS OF POLITICS 36 (1952). 650</page><page sequence="32">THE "SECURITY STATE" tempts simultaneously to locate it and time its velocity.""05 Another necessary refinement of the veto-group concept is that of distin- guishing a hierarchy of power among the groups themselves. Some are more powerful than others. Again, Riesman recognizes but fails to emphasize this factor.l06 In the group process, leaders of the various groups bargain among themselves to reach temporary accords with respect to par- ticular issues. Power on the national level should be viewed in terms of issues, not in terms of dominant decision-makers. This is a necessary corollary derived from the fact of the diffusion of power manifested in a system of social pluralism. Under the group system, bargaining must take place in order for decisions to be made. If there was basic agreement among groups and group leaders, then there would be no need to bargain. Furthermore, if the groups and group leaders agreed on nothing, then no bargain- ing could take place. There must at least be agreement on funda- mental goals, on the ends sought; the bargaining has to be over the means to achieve those ends.107 "Leaders bargain because they disagree and expect that further agreement is possible and will be profitable-and the profit sought may accrue not merely to the individual self but to the group, an alliance of groups, a region, a nation, unborn generations, 'the public interest.' "''0 The fact of bargaining in the process of decision-making in turn creates the 105. RIESMAN, THE LONELY CROWD 252 (1950). 106. Ibid.

And the condition of co-operation is agreement, both as to the ends to which effort should be applied, and the criteria by which its success is to be judged. "Agreement as to ends implies the acceptance of a standard of values, by which the position to be assigned to different objects may be determined." TAWNEY, RELIGION AND THE RISE OF CAPITALISM 283 (1926). In the present day, the struggle over Negro rights in the Southern United States (and elsewhere both throughout the United States itself and in much of the rest of the world, the South being merely the focus of present attention) illustrates what happens when there is no agreement on goal values. Whites, speaking very generally, do not deny the fact of discrimination against the Negro, but do take strong positions on what should be done about it. Basic agreement in end values to be striven for is lacking. I have touched on this matter in MILLER, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND PRIVATE EDUCATION: A LEGAL ANALYSIS C. 3 (1957). 108.

For often enough there is no 'sov- ereign people.' Many decisions are made by a loose confederacy of giant organizations each with great control over the others. Under these conditions decisions can be arrived at only through horse trading, bargaining, the negotiation of treaties. Stripped of its glamour, shorn of its magical legalistic incantations, government very often turns out to be simply one of the bargainers. However undignified it may seem to the disciple of Bodin, government must engage in horse trading with corporations, trade unions, farm organizations, and other groups with control in the society."

In the United States, this person is often the politician; his role is that of the key bargainer. He juggles the conflicting interests of groups, creates alliances among groups, and effects the compromise among seemingly irreconcilable views. Examples, among many, include the late President Franklin Roose- velt, and Senator Lyndon Johnson, at present the majority leader in the Senate.109 The consequence of all this has been pointed out in a recent jointly produced study by a political scientist and an economist: "No unified, cohesive, acknowledged, and legitimate representa- tive-leaders of the 'national majority' exist in the United States."10 No one veto group normally is strong enough to make its policies prevail, but it is in a position to bargain and either to prevent or to weaken policies adverse to it. A veto group is thus an influence group, a "pressure group," and government in the United States is a government by coalition, a coalition in which minority groups often wield great power.1l Furthermore, government by coalition "increases the likelihood of situations in which one set of [national] policies cancels out another."'12 The fact of the existence of bar- gaining as a basic political technique makes it difficult, perhaps impossible, for all policies to be consistent. Rational social action, in short, may be highly improbable, perhaps impossible.13 Na- tional policies can and do compete. When they do, a resolution must be effected. That resolution will tend to be that which attains the approval of a common denominator of the groups most affected. Within the State itself, each of the branches of government has 109.

Inconsistency in policies is to be expected once it is seen how policies are formed -through the interaction of competing interest groups. Furthermore, policies can be enunciated in such a form as to make it unlikely that the ends sought will be achieved. The "trade, not aid" program of the United States can be taken as an illustration of this latter point. 652</page><page sequence="34">THE "SECURITY STATE" its own specialized role to play. The legislature (Congress) op- erates as an arbiter of the group struggle, notes the emergence of a successful compromise or conquest, and enacts a statute which in effect ratifies the result. As an official group, the Congress has drives and demands of its own,1l4 but essentially it serves to recognize when an equilibrium is reached in group struggle and to place then its imprimatur on that equilibrium. To a marked extent, this may be said to be Calhoun's doctrine of the concurrent majority in action: No important group is forced to accept legislation un- favorable to it in the particulars in which it is most vitally in- terested.ll5 Furthermore, Congress at times operates to correct outrageous decisions made by the private legislative process of the factory com- munity. In doing this, Congress and the Supreme Court often act in concert, complementing each other. Congress, however, is the dominant member of the duo. For example, the antitrust laws are really used by Congress to try to establish and enforce norms of corporate behavior; the fundamental problem dealt with is that of the distribution of power in the community."6 The broad policy statement is established by Congress, which then leaves it up to the Court to make necessary refinements and applications to particu- lar situations. In other areas where the exercise of private power becomes sufficiently obnoxious, Congress can and does step in to redress the balance of power and, at times, to attempt to provide protection for individual liberty. This "taming of feudal insti- tutions""' is also done by the Supreme Court acting alone, without prior legislative guidance. Such activity by the State is necessary, for, as Robert Hale has pointed out, as far as individual liberty is concerned, it is just as important that legis- lative bodies should be able to protect persons from oppression at the hands of private groups which exercise power indistinguishable from that exercised by government as it is that courts should be able to protect them from oppression by officials whose power is more generally recog- nized as governmental.118 114.

For the business community, this is done through the antitrust laws, the laws regulating currency, and similar control legislation. For labor relations, this includes the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts, in addition to other basic labor laws. In this function, Congress tries to stimulate the decentralized decision- making function of the private groups, acting under the assump- tion that the public weal will be realized through such decentral- ization. Rather than try to take over and make the decisions, Congress merely provides the framework so that decision-making can be regularized and widely shared throughout the nation. The third function's details are largely delegated to the courts and, more important, to the federal bureaucracy to carry out. It is the role of the bureaucracy to see that the basic ground rules established by Congress are obeyed. Application of the general rules to an infinitely detailed number of particular instances is the way in which this is carried out. Another primary function of the bureaucracy is that of representing the unofficial groups, whose activities they are set up to regulate in the governmental decision- making process. This does not mean, as is often averred, that a regulatory commission becomes the captive of the activity regu- lated, but it does mean that the regulators, for whatever reason, tend to espouse the cause of the regulated when conflicts with other group interests arise. Finally, in conjunction with the executive, the bureaucracy exists to further the public, as distinguished from group, interest-the interests of all of the people of the nation. Whether it does or not is the subject of considerable controversy."1 Ostensibly superior to the bureaucracy is the federal court sys- tem, which operates to check the administrators and see to it that they adhere to the statutory rules and to constitutional mandate. Actually, however, judicial control of the administrative agency is nominal at best. Great deference is paid to a mysterious quality called expertise which administrators are reputed to have. Of course, that is just a confession on the part of the courts and judges that they don't know much about modern business affairs in an industrial civilization. The Supreme Court itself has been quick 119. See the articles cited in note 82 supra.

It does operate to effect a nexus between fundamental economic institutions and the fundamental law. But the flow of decisions in administrative law during the past twenty years indicates a judicial desire to leave the routine process of governmental decision-making to the bu- reaucracy, subject only to tenuous judicial restraints. Thus, the role of the Supreme Court is to effect, through the medium of statutory interpretation, adherence by groups to nationally pre- scribed legislative policies; and through the medium of constitu- tional interpretation, adherence to constitutional norms. While it is no doubt true that the Court's decisions on personal liberties really relate to the liberties of groups, the necessary corrollary is the responsibility of groups to adhere to the fundamental prescrip- tions of the Constitution. Hence, the Supreme Court has a dual role to play: on the one hand, it operates as an arm of the legisla- ture to put legislative policy into operation; on the other, by en- larging the zone of officiality it operates to prevent the excessive use of arbitrary power by private law-making groups. This second function is just now in its formative stages; but it is the direction of future judicial law-making. Enlargement of the zone of officiality by the Supreme Court in- volves bringing within the scope of governmental action, and thus within the reach of the proscriptions of the Constitution, the ac- tivities of private groups which have been invested with governing functions. In effect, the Court "public-izes" the system of private governments. This is accomplished in two ways. First, by accord- ing a high degree of deference to Congress, the Court legitimizes governmental participation on a broad scope in societal affairs. The result of this is that much of what was formerly beyond public control has now been "politicized"; and that "in the mass societies of the twentieth century, politics and public affairs have come to impinge ever more closely on the life of the common man."'12 For 120.

More important, perhaps, is the second method by which the Supreme Court enlarges the zone of officiality. Whenever any or- ganization or group performs a function of a sufficiently important public nature it can be said to be performing a governmental func- tion and thus should have its actions considered against the broad provisions of the Constitution. In the racial covenant cases, the white primary cases, and the company town cases, the Court "has shown that the concept of private action must yield to a conception of state action where public functions are being performed ... .""2 With the continuing "pluralizing" of American society and the in- creasing recognition of the governmental power of private groups, it can be forecast with some certainty that this trend of the Court of public-izing private groups will continue. It is the important constitutional law development of the mid-twentieth century.13 The President and his executive advisers have, if the foregoing outline is valid, a dual role: as the chief decision-brokers, operating as titular and actual head of the "government by committee" set out above; and as the principal exponent of the national interest, as distinguished from sectional or group interests. In both of these, the President has had to transcend what the Constitution appar- ently says and, today at least, to adopt a theory of office which is far more than that which the late Chief Justice Fred Vinson casti- gated as a "messenger-boy" concept of the presidency.124 With Congress by and large made up of spokesmen for lesser interests and with the judiciary unable to perform affirmatively, the President has willy-nilly been forced to take an aggressive pos- ture in order to get the urgent business of governing done. As guardian of the over-all national interest, he attempts with varying sense, the masses determine the basic political decisions which affect them, and they are encouraged by their leaders to believe that they actually exercise such power. But the complexity of modern economic and political decisions and the professionalization of the decision-making process has created the feeling that in actuality the masses can neither 'understand nor influence the very events upon which their life and happiness is known to depend.' There has been, according to this view, an increasing sense of 'incompetence' among the masses." 122.

To a large degree, his job has been institutionalized in the National Security Council and other offices of the President's immediate vicinity. Whether the President (or anyone else) can trigger what we have previously mentioned as the "reserve function of the State" will be developed shortly. Before doing that, however, it is desir- able to make brief mention of the What of decision-making: the decisions themselves and what they relate to. III. POWER AND THE INDIVIDUAL: THE "WHAT" OF DECISIONS In the foregoing discussion, we have postulated that wielders of power other than the State should be recognized in a contempo- rary projection of constitutional law-the Who of decision-making. We have ventured more modestly into the How of decision-making, as a complex interaction of group interest. Left now for skeletal development is the What of decision-making: the important de- cision itself and what it involves. Decisions of an important nature relate to the manner in which values are shaped and shared in the national community by a sig- nificant segment of the populace.125 A person, a group, a govern- mental organ wields power to the extent to which his or its de- sires can be imposed on a significant number of people. The actual exercise of power is on individuals as individuals, but it is the cu- mulative effect rather than the discrete instance that is important. Our interest here includes both the decisions made by official groups (those in government) and by unofficial groups. Our basic premise that power is exercised pluralistically rather than monistically per- haps leaves little for the theory of the "reserve function" of the State. Nevertheless, there are some decisions made solely by the State, whatever their derivation and however influenced, and we are also interested in them. So far as societal groups are concerned, the fac- tory community has been singled out as perhaps the most impor- tant. In speaking of the factory community, reference is made to the view that it includes both of what are ordinarily called separate, antagonistic groups: the managers and labor. It is more than an a priori hypothesis that a given enterprise is made up of several in- 125. See Mayo, The Limited Forum, The Free Forum, 22 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 261, 387 (1954) for discussion of the "important decision." July 1958] 657</page><page sequence="39">STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. Io: Page 620 terests-the "owners" (stockholders), the managers, the rank and file of labor, and the union managers-26-all of whom have more to gain from cooperation than from antagonistic competition, and who, as a consequence, can validly be thought of as a single unit so far as its relations to the remainder of the nation are concerned.1'2 Competition there surely is within the factory community, particu- larly between corporate management and union management; but it is competition within fairly narrow channels and is to be viewed against the far greater incidence of cooperation among the various interests within the community. The What of decisions as they affect individuals may be devel- oped by indicating how group decisions, by official and unofficial groups, directly or indirectly influence the value position of individ- uals. For present purposes, the value of categorization of Lasswell and Kaplan can be adopted. In their Power and Society, eight basic values are set out: power, wealth, well-being, skill, enlightenment, affection, rectitude, and respect.128 How do group decisions shape the values-of members of the group itself, of persons outside the group, and of people generally as expressed in the State (govern- ment) ? The pre-eminent value is Power, which was also set out above as the key concept in the study of constitutional law. The principal point about Power is that an individual's capacity qua individual to control the decisions which directly or indirectly affect his value position is largely nonexistent today, if, indeed, he had such ca- pacity in the past. He is unable to bargain over the other matters which are important to him. His choice-and even here it is not absolute-is limited to that of what group he wishes to join. For once he joins, then his rights and liabilities, duties and responsibili- ties are beyond his capacity to alter. He can leave the group, al- though often that supposed choice may be more theoretical than real. This is particularly true if the person is economically depend- ent upon the group for his livelihood. "In the general course of human nature," it is observed in the Federalist Papers, "a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will.'129 In order to see how the loss of Power affects other values, let us 126.

Mits, an employee of a large corporation, and his brother-in-law, Mr. T. O. Mann, a junior executive in a small insurance company.130 Mits is a member of a factory community, while Mann is outside that particular com- munity. Mits is a member of the union, having had to join when he became an employee. So far as Mits is concerned, he cannot bargain over the price of his labor, the working conditions in which he spends his day, or the fringe benefits to be gained under the collective-bargaining contract. He has had to join the union whether he wanted to or not, since this particular factory community has a union security agreement. He is subject to the discipline of the union. Depending on the size of the union, it is doubtful whether he will have more than a very tenuous capacity to exercise any influence over union decisions or union managers. In other words, his control over the values-wealth, well-being, and even skill-has vanished. Those decisions are made for him, by the group to which he belongs. In addition, the State-another group-has also intervened into the life of the community and set certain minimal standards of wages and working conditions. Usually, however, Mits cannot in- voke the power of the State should he have any grievance.13' In like fashion, other groups greatly influence the manner in which the other values are shaped by Mits. Enlightenment is more and more under the control of the mass media, while governmental secrecy policies serve to prevent him from learning much of the activities of the State. His church and similar organizations enter into his value of Rectitude. It can, in short, be said that in practi- cally no part of his daily activities is Mits free from the pervasive influence of decisions made for him by groups. This is certainly true of what he does outside his home, and it is true to a degree of his actions while with his family. Nowhere is he left without guid- 130. Mr. T. C. Mits's name denotes "the celebrated man in the street." Mr. T. O. Mann is, of course, The Organization Man. Compare De Schweinitz, Normative Implica- tions of the "New Competition," 23 Soc. RESEARCH 379 (1956) with the text statement in these paragraphs. 131. If his grievance is against corporate management, he normally can invoke the machinery set up under the collective-bargaining agreement. See Hepburn &amp; Loiseaux, The Nature of the Arbitration Process, 10 VAND. L. REV. 657 (1957). But if his grievance is against the union, then he will have a tougher, although not insuperable, job. The as- sumption is that the employee and the management of his union will see eye to eye and will not have such disputes, an assumption which may or may not be warranted. And, of course, the employee may be subjected to union discipline, as well as discipline from corpo- rate management. See Summers, Legal Limitations on Union Discipline. 64 HARV. L.

Although Mann may ostensibly have a greater degree of freedom, since he is not subject to direct union power, nevertheless the decisions of others guide his behavior. Group-made behavior patterns will indicate his courses of action within his organization. The decisions of the factory com- munity exercise control through such means as "administered prices,"33 the direction and tempo of production, and the flow of investment. In none of these does Mann-or, for that matter, does anyone, including the State-exercise much if any control. Mann's values are shaped in the same ways as are those of Mits. People generally, as well as individually, thus find themselves controlled in their behavior by group decisions which have the over- all effect of allocating resources, investing capital, and engaging in economic development. In none of these does the State exercise what Friedmann has called its "reserve function."134 The net result is that the individual, as Erich Fromm has dis- cussed, "freed from the bonds of pre-individualistic society ... [has escaped] from the burden of this freedom into new dependencies and submission."'13 He has not seized the opportunity to exercise freedom to do the things necessary to realize "the expression of his intellectual, emotional and sensuous potentialities . . . based upon the uniqueness and individuality of man."'36 He has, in some measure, been able to realize freedom from some of the restraints imposed by governmental officials. That is one of the purposes of the United States Constitution. In the next section we will discuss the question of whether the Constitution should be applied to cen- ters of power other than the government and, if so, to what extent. Group-made decisions, particularly those of the factory com- munities, furthermore exert a high degree of control over the flow of governmental decisions. This power raises real questions of con- trol for the public good, as do the other exercises of power which, taken in their cumulative effect, provide guidance for the direction 132.

Governmental decisions, as we have seen, are often the result of pressures brought by local group interests, operating through their elected representatives (lobbies and the like), through pressures brought to bear on the bureauc- racy, and through control over the mass media. In all of these, despite the high degree of public interest, the State has been found to be practically powerless to combat or to deal with effectively. The What of decision-making, thus, boils down to the fact that groups of one type or another, acting in concert through a bargain- ing process, exercise power over the vast majority of important so- cietal decisions. This situation raises two questions of crucial im- portance to American constitutionalism today: (i) To what extent should an individual be able to invoke the Constitution as a re- straint upon arbitrary action taken by groups which vitally affect his values? (2) To what extent can truly national decisions be made, decisions which can be called in the national interest, or in Lippmann's Public Interest? The first of these questions fits into the traditional mold of con- stitutional law and requires only a slight change of focus of the present flow of decisions in constitutional construction. If the fac- tory community is a "private" government, to put it another way, should it not be treated as such under the Constitution ? The second question is different in focus: rather than striking down certain behavior, it deals with the problem of attaining a cer- tain type of behavior in an affirmative sense. It is a political prob- lem, one of the first order of magnitude, one which strikes at the heart of the American Constitution. It is to these questions that we now turn. IV. THE TASKS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM TODAY A. Constitutional Limitations on the Private Exercise of Power If the factory community is taken as the basic private group to use as a model, it can be seen that power exercised by that group is of two types. On the one hand, there are the decisions made by the factory community which relate to the direction and intensity of investment, the nature of economic development, and other similar economic factors. On the other, there are decisions which, rather than indirectly as in the first category, directly affect an individual in his value position. The first group of decisions may be consid- ered by some as constituting a situation demanding some sort of</page><page sequence="43">STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. io: Page 620 public, or at least external, control over those decisions. A delinea- tion of possible control techniques has, in fact, recently been sug- gested by Wolfgang Friedmann.l37 These techniques run the gamut from total socialization through mixed public and private enterprises, cooperatives, mixed companies, capital and labor part- nerships, public regulation by commission, and antitrust legisla- tion to other similar social restraints. While all of these raise at least peripheral constitutional questions, not one calls for the applica- tion of constitutional precepts to the decisions of the factory com- munity. Indeed, in this aspect of the group decision-making pro- cess it is difficult to see how the Constitution could be validly ap- plied. Control, if it should be imposed, would not be through the medium of resort to a basic higher law.138 It is in the second category of decisions-those taken by the fac- tory community (and other groups) which directly affect the value position of individuals-that the question arises whether the Con- stitution can and should be applied to private exercises of power. "The Constitution," it is often said, "runs against governments only."'13 Is it now time to recognize the dimension of private gov- ernments ? Liminally, we can set out the following propositions: I) The Constitution was framed on the theory that limitations should exist on the formal exercise of power in government but not on control in fact exercised unofficially. 2) The essential problem of individual liberty, however, is one of freedom from arbitrary restraints and restrictions, wherever and however imposed. 3) The Constitution should be so construed as to apply to arbi- trary applications of power against individuals by centers of private government. 4) The main flow of group decisions in the factory community would not be thrown into litigation or controversy by such a con- stitutional construction, but only those which directly and substan- tially affect an individual. 5) It would take only a slight modification of present consti- tutional doctrine to effect such a constitutional construction. 137. Friedmann, supra note 134. See also KELSO &amp; ADLER, THE CAPITALIST MANI- FESTO Pt. II (1958). 138. A contemporary study of constitutional law would, however, need to have some reference made to such techniques of control of the private decision-making process. 139. PEKELIS, LAW AND SOCIAL ACTION (1950). 662</page><page sequence="44">THE "SECURITY STATE" Our discussion can well begin with a quotation, one designed to underscore the proposition that the factory community should be recognized as a private government. One paramount conclusion emerges from the various representative analyses that have been sketched out above-and they apply to all in- dustrialized democracies of our time, with differences only of degree rather than substance. The corporate organizations of business and labor have long ceased to be private phenomena. That they have a direct and decisive impact on the social, economic, and political life of the nation is no longer a matter of argument. It is an undeniable fact of daily ex- perience. The challenge to the contemporary lawyer is to translate the social transformation of these organizations from private associations to public organisms into legal terms.140 Hobbes once likened private associations to "worms in the en- trails of man"141 and sought ways to minimize their influence. Madison, in the Federalist Papers,l42 dealt extensively with them. The problem seems to be not of attempting the impossible and eliminating them but of insuring that their excesses are curbed. One way of doing this, insofar as individuals are concerned, is through application of the basic limitations of the Constitution to certain group decisions. The basic proposition here asserted is this: That governing power, wherever located, should be subject to the fundamental constitutional limitation of due process of law. Cast- ing the proposition in that form serves to eliminate the great ma- jority of group decisions-those which do not impinge directly on an individual. It is a proposition which calls for the nonarbitrary use of power by the factory community (and other groups) against individuals, bottomed on the assumption that societal groups have responsibilities as well as rights under the Constitution, and that one of those responsibilities is not to act arbitrarily toward certain individuals. Let us suppose two different factual situations in order to see how such a proposition would operate. First, take the situation where an employee of a factory community is discharged from his job for the announced reason that his loyalty to the United States is in question.143 Should he be accorded "due process of law?" Would it make any difference if the enterprise is one which has a 140. Friedmann, supra note 134, at 176. [Emphasis added.] 141. HOBBES, LEVIATHAN (Everyman's ed. 1940). 142.

The second factual situation involves a member of an ethnic group, say a Negro, who is denied employment by the enterprise because of his race. Should he be able to contest that decision on constitutional grounds ? If so, under what theory should he proceed? The basic proposition which we have set out above should, it is believed, cover both of these situations. The factory worker dis- charged for loyalty reasons should be afforded "procedural due process of law"; the Negro denied employment should be granted rights under a theory of equal protection of the laws, or, possibly, a theory of "substantive due process." For both, the constitutional problem is essentially the same: that of persuading the United States Supreme Court to extend its cognizance of the performance of governmental functions by the factory community. In large part, although not entirely, this would involve the necessity of expanding the constitutional concept of state action to include the factory community, of enlarging the zone of officiality. The historical trend of judicial decision-making has been that of bringing more and more activity within the reach of the limita- tions of the Constitution. Since 1789, moreover, more and more governmental activity has been made subject to due process and similar limitations.144 The next logical step would be to draw pri- vate governments into the tent of state action. This is not a par- ticularly startling proposition, for a number of recent cases have shown that "the concept of private action must yield to a conception of state action where public functions are being performed ...."145 Illustrative are Marsh v. Alabama,14 Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nash- ville R.R.,147 and Syres v. Oil Workers Int'l Union.48 State courts in Kansas and California have reached similar results.149 Compare the following statements of the United States Supreme Court and the California Supreme Court: 144.

For the representative is clothed with power not unlike that of a legislature which is subject to constitu- tional limitations on its power to deny, restrict, destroy or discriminate against the rights of those for whom it legislates and which is also under an affirmative constitutional duty equally to protect those rights.l50 .... Where a union has . . . attained a monopoly of the supply of labor by means of closed shop agreements and other forms of collec- tive labor action, such a union occupies a quasi public position similar to that of a public service business and it has certain corresponding obli- gations. It may no longer claim the same freedom from legal restraint enjoyed by golf clubs or fraternal associations. Its asserted right to choose its own members does not merely relate to social relations; it affects the fundamental right to work for a living.'51 What is true of a labor union is certainly true of the factory community of which the union is a part. For the employee who is threatened with discharge, or is in fact discharged, from the community, a compelling case can be built that it should not be accomplished in an arbitrary way. The employee should get "his day in court," so to speak; he should have due process of law. His capacity to earn a living, perhaps the most important value he has, is directly affected. It should not be denied him by arbitrary pre- rogative.12 And if we go a step further and posit the fact that the enterprise for which he works is the recipient of federal contracts, it can be stated that the employee should be able to invoke the due process clause of the fifth amendment (in addition to his possible use of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment). The contractor of the government in such an instance can, without undue strain on established legal categories, be considered to be an agent of the federal government, clothed with the protection of the federal government,53 and to that extent subject to the same con- stitutional limitations as the federal government.l54 150.

Arbitrariness may characterize the action of either corporate management or union management, against both of whom the individual worker may be powerless. 153.

See Miller, State Power over the Federal Contractor: A Problem in Federalism, 11 VAND. L. REV. 175 (1957). If a contractor is to be given the immunity of the national government in certain instances, why shouldn't it also take on the responsibility of government to adhere to fundamental constitutional norms? 154.

He is not yet a member of that com- munity, and not yet subject to its governing power, but again a compelling case can be established that he is being subjected to arbi- trary power. Whether the attack on that power is bottomed on equal-protection grounds (as an unreasonable classification) or on due-process grounds (substantive due process), the problem would again be that of convincing the Supreme Court that the factory community was a form of state action. And if the particular enter- prise in question was a federal contractor there would seem to be no insuperable reason why the Negro could not invoke the fifth amendment's due-process clause. These, then, are the limited type of decisions made by the fac- tory community, whether by corporate management or union man- agement, which should be made subject to constitutional proscrip- tions. The great bulk of decisions, if controlled at all, would have to be met with other techniques-probably legislation by Congress or by the growth of countervailing power centers. At issue is the position of the individual in an industrial civilization, a civiliza- tion basically different from that which existed at the time the United States Constitution was promulgated. B. The Problem of Consensus in a Pluralistic Society One result of the thrust of history which catapulted the United States into the center of the world political arena in the twentieth century has been an unheralded and little discussed constitutional crisis. Nothing less than our constitutional system may be at stake: politically and legally the problem revolves around the difficulty of getting true "national interest" decisions in a polity dominated pluralistically, but the malady is even larger. "There can be no grosser mistake," observed Sir Henry Maine in I886, than the impression that "Democracy differs from Mon- archy in essence .... The tests of success in the performance of the necessary and natural duties of a government are precisely the same in both cases."155 Those "necessary and natural duties of gov- ernment" are, as Walter Lippmann has pointed out, the defense and advancement abroad of the vital interests of the nation, and order, 155.

Or is there a Gresham's law of politics in which the soft decisions tend to tri- umph over the hard ones? These are tough questions, ones which go to the heart of American constitutionalism. The following propositions can be ventured as a point of de- parture for a brief discussion: i) The Constitution as drafted is largely a charter for the reso- lution of purely domestic matters. Although war is mentioned, it is apparent that the framers considered international peace to be the normal state of affairs. Problems of war and application of the Constitution during times of war are not mentioned; problems of "cold war" did not even enter the minds of the Founding Fathers. 2) The original constitutional theory of limited government, particularly that of the centralized authority, requires revamping. The notion that that government is best which governs least no longer seems to be tenable. The essential negativism of the Con- stitution toward government requires alteration to a recognition of the affirmative duties of the State. 3) The imperatives of the twentieth century have made it nec- essary for the "national" or "public" interest to have an authorita- tive spokesman. But in the constitutional system as it exists in fact today there is no one, not even the President, who can speak so as to enforce the national interest. 4) Pluralistic society, to be successful, requires not only a com- mon agreement on goal values to be sought but also a common willingness to forego group advantage for the general good. The crisis in constitutionalism today, in essence, revolves around the problem of getting true national-interest decisions in a system in which decisions are the result of the interaction of group interests and tend to reflect the lowest common denominator among affected groups. It is particularly acute today, for governmental decision- makers are unable to call on the "reserve function" of the State at a period in which the nation is poised somewhere between peace and war.57 The issues-the great issues-facing the nation are beyond 156.

It has shown itself to be a dan- gerous master of decisions when the stakes are life and death."160 The problem is one greater than that of attaining consensus in the national decision-making process: the consensus so reached must reflect more than the normal bargaining and compromises- it must in some way transcend parochial interests and reach the overall public interest.16 One illustration should suffice to indicate where between the two. See GROB, THE RELATIVITY OF WAR AND PEACE (1949); Mc- Dougal, Peace and War: Factual Continuum with Multiple Legal Consequences, 49 AM. J. INT'L L. 63 (1955); Jessup, Should International Law Recognize an Intermediate Status Between Peace and War?, 48 AM. J. INT'L L. 98 (1954). The United States Constitution makes no provision for a status of war or cold war, other than what can be gleaned from the view that such silence means no change in the fundamental law during times of war. But Supreme Court interpretation, mainly during World War II, has apparently developed a constitutional law for times of war. See RoSSITER, CONSTITUTIONAL DICTATORSHIP 265-87 (1948); ROSSITER, THE SUPREME COURT AND THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF (1951). 158. Numerous Gallup Polls are impressive testimony to the text statement. The bulk of Americans simply do not have any knowledge of, or real interest in, important issues facing the nation, particularly those of external relations. Furthermore, when governmental officials wish to present burning issues to the public, they have to be put in such oversimpli- fied terms of black and white, of absolute right and wrong, that the issues are greatly dis- torted. See the quotation, note 121 supra. The facts of lack of knowledge on a broad basis and universal adult suffrage opens the door to manipulation of the voters through the use of psychological techniques taken over by the advertising and public relations fraternity and, to some extent, by the politicians. It seems to me that the concept of "manipulated democracy"-a problem little explored as yet by social scientists-is an ominous one indeed. See Judge Clary's opinion in the recent antitrust case between the truckers and the railroads, Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. v. Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference, 155 F. Supp. 768 (E.D. Pa. 1957), commented on in The Economist, Dec. 7, 1957, p. 869. An example of the political use of manipulation came in early 1958 when the Republican administration named Eric Johnston chairman of a committee to drum up support for the proposed re-enactment of the reciprocal trade agree- ments legislation. 159.

LIPPMANN, op. cit. supra note 156, at 20. 161. It is recognized that the term "public interest," as used here, is subject to con- siderable disagreement on alleged ideological grounds. The problems arise because the term is difficult to define and because controversy exists over how the public interest on a particular issue should be ascertained and who should do it. There are, for example, those who maintain that: There is no national interest apart from the consensus of private interests which comprise the State. In a democracy, the two are equivalent. Once assume that a national interest exists apart, we are committed ineluctably to the notion that some special persons apart from the "consensus-takers" are better equipped to spot that separate and transcendent national interest, and are thereby free to take the nation in the direction of their allegedly superior knowledge of that interest, even over the protest of the populace from whom these superior few derive their power. This scheme is dangerous, presumptive, and repugnant to democratic theory. Without undertaking a full-scale discussion of the question, it can be said that this view is</page><page sequence="50">THE "SECURITY STATE" the nature of the problem. It is drawn from the penumbral area where constitutional and international law meet and merge. A cardinal point of the post-World War II American economic policy toward other nations has been summed up in the phrase, "Trade, Not Aid." Whether mistakenly or not, apparently what is meant by this is the re-creation of a system of multilateral world trade carried out with minimal, if any, national barriers.16 Most of the effort thus far has been directed toward the implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.'63 Although both President Truman and President Eisenhower, together with the majority of informed commentators, have tried valiantly to make American participation in GATT more meaningful, all the efforts have foundered on the shoals of group interest domestically. The International Trade Organization became a dead letter, and, thus far at least, the Organization for Trade Cooperation appears likely to meet a similar fate.164 The point is that what the President and many others thought was in the national interest has had to give way to parochial interests thrust forward by groups who fear the impact of an expanded world trade. Another facet of this same problem is shown in the question of faulty for the following reasons: It consists of a post hoc label on the outcome of the group struggle; hence, the public interest does not exist until after the group struggle has been lost and won. Therefore, it can provide no standard for policy formation. Moreover, it tends to become a statement that "whatever is, is right," and thus to maintain that all public policy is in the public interest. Finally, it seems to be the result of a naive belief in a sort of political Darwinism that assumes that everything will work out properly if everyone pursues his own interests; and is thus the political counterpart of the now repudi- ated belief in the "invisible hand" espoused by Adam Smith. The consensus reached by the group struggle may coincide with the national interest, and in fact often does. But that does not mean that it is inevitable or even probable, par- ticularly in foreign affairs. In a democratic society, it is the Chief Executive who must speak for and attempt to enforce the public interest. He is the only official elected by the people at large; and he is in the best position to assert the larger interest. But under the constitutional system as it now exists, this is often extremely difficult, if not impossible. Compare, in this regard, CORWIN, THE PRESIDENT: OFFICE AND POWERS c. 7 (4th ed. 1957) with CHEEVER &amp; HAVILAND, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS (1952). This is, of course, not a new problem of government. Edmund Burke devoted a great deal of attention to it. See 2 WORKS OF EDMUND BURKE (1839), discussed in FRIEDRICH, CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS 230, 453 (1937). And Madison, in THE FEDERALIST No. 10, discusses the same problem. But being old does not make it any the less acute today. See ALMOND, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FOREIGN POLICY passim (1950). See also DAHL, CONGRESS AND FOREIGN POLICY (1950). 162. The "Trade, Not Aid" program seems to me to be bottomed on at least two faulty premises, centered around the primary view that the nineteenth-century model of international trade can be re-created today. 163.

Efforts by the State Department to retain the Japanese orientation toward the United States have run into difficulties. A recognition that Japan must trade to live led to the limited importation of textiles, only to be met with outraged cries from domestic manufacturers. Again, the parochial interest was served at the expense of what was apparently the national in- terest. The amount of textiles allowed to be imported was severely reduced.65 This was another failure of leadership, brought about by the national governmental officials registering the popular will, or the will of the affected private groups. The international result of this type of domestic activity may well be a diminution of the power position of the United States vis-a-vis Soviet Russia. What may be a fatal weakness of the Amer- ican constitutional democracy is clearly evident. There is no spokes- man for the national or public interest, if the illustration just set out indicates the general rule. And there may be no common willingness to forgo group advantage for the greater good. This raises the question in clear focus of whether the State can in fact draw on a "reserve function" in such circumstances. In times of outright, widely recognized emergency there is no doubt that the State does have a reserve function which enables it to transcend, albeit temporarily, parochial group interests. War is an illustration, the depression of the I930's perhaps another- at least in the early days of President Roosevelt's first term.'66 On the other hand, during "normal" times it seems equally clear that the State cannot draw on that reserve function. This, how- ever, is not a black-and-white proposition. The "normality" of today is widely enough recognized as something of a quasi-emer- gency, so that the State can enforce certain minimal demands. Se- lective service can be carried on; high taxes to pay for high defense expenditures are borne, although somewhat grumblingly. But the tougher decisions, those which vitally affect important group in- terests, cannot be made. The challenge this brings to the lawyer is of the first order of magnitude: that of providing the legal (i.e., constitutional) basis for a decision-making process which would be reasonably calcu- lated to further the national interest. This is a greater challenge 165. See Miller, Japanese Textiles: Some Legal Problems in the Area where Constitu- tional Law Meets International Law, 35 N.C.L. REV. 457 (1957). 166.

It is no exaggeration to say that the American constitutional system will prosper or founder, depending on the manner in which this chal- lenge is met-met, that is to say, not only by lawyers, but by other community leaders as well. V. ADDENDUM In the foregoing brief statement, some of the essentials of a con- temporary statement of constitutional law and theory have been set out. What has been said is only an outline sketching in the framework of a new, or at least a somewhat different, look at American constitutionalism from a legal standpoint. It is of course obvious that the outline would have to be developed in detail before all of the nuances and qualifications of the statements could be shown. Enough has perhaps been said, however, to indicate that the massive changes in American society and in the doctrine of the Constitution require rethinking the basic premises of the constitu- tional system. A modernized study of constitutional law can well use a decision-making approach, one which inquires into the wield- ers in fact of power as well as those clothed with formal authority to make decisions.'7 And the inhabitants of the Security State are in need of a theory which will serve the dual purpose of placing proper restraints on the exercise of power and providing for the making of true "public interest" decisions. The study of constitu- tional law today should include not only what governments can and cannot do, but also what they must do. 167. Such a study would of course focus on the decisions made by governmental bodies, including courts, as well as those made by "private" governments. The traditional content of constitutional law-decisions made by the United States Supreme Court- would constitute one part of the overall development. In the present statement, I have used references to treatises and other similar extensive developments more than case mate- rial. Both would be necessary in an expanded treatment. For the constitutional lawyer of the future-as in the past-must be privy to the teachings of political science and economics as well as other pertinent disciplines. July I958] 67I</page></plain_text>
