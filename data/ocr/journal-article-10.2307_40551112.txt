<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ben Stoltzfus UN REGICIDE: A METAPHORICAL INTRIGUE Un Régicide (written in 1949) is Alain Robbe-Grillet's first novel. It is an ambitious and difficult work which was submitted to a Paris publishing house, rejected, kept in a drawer for almost thirty years, and finally published in 1978 by Les Éditions de Minuit. It is an ambitious piece of fiction because it bears the obvious, recognizable traces of Kafka, Beckett, Sartre, and Camus; difficult, because it contains an embryonic Robbe-Grillet who is not easy to decipher in spite of his many sub- sequent works and everything we already know about the theories, literary adventures, reflexive endeavors, and innovative polemics of the "nouveau ro- man"; in spite of everything we also know about mental labyrinths, novels that self-destruct, typologies (or the absence thereof), linguistic codes, "thèmes générateurs," and the metaphorical "cellules génératrices" of the "nouveau nouveau roman." Un Régicide is a work that adumbrates the new novel's attempts to elabo- rate a form, to structure a narrative point of view, to harmonize objective and subjective voices-man's sense of an inner and outer being and the ontological reality engendered by such an awareness. Throughout the novel, alternately, two voices, an "il" (Boris) and an anonymous "je," chronicle different sensi- bilities that will, in time, fuse into the identity of one individual, a character reminiscent of Daniel O'Donovan, Julien Green's schizophrenic hero in Le Voyageur sur la terre, except that O'Donovan's suicide bespeaks mainly of his split personality, whereas the "Boris-je" ennui carries with it specific authorial intentions. In due course, as the "je" and the "il" merge, the novel's separate tropes become one-blended and liquefied. The menace of humidity, fog, water, and drowning is omnipresent in spite of the sandy beaches which are a privileged border zone between land and sea. This novel's cyclical structure, like the one in Pinget's Passacaille, a novel Robbe-Grillet admires greatly, has, at the beginning and the end, a menacing and rising tide that threatens to engulf the narrator. Passacaille*^ circular rhythm consists of continuous varia- tions on a ground bass in slow triple meter (based on the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century musical form) that whirl the reader from where the novel ends back to the beginning. Passacaille, the dance as well as the language of</page><page sequence="2">270 FRENCH FORUM the novel, moves in circles going nowhere, enjoying the pure polyphony of movement. The tension between life and death, winter and summer, creation and destruction, comes to rest on the compost heap of existence-life's and art's self-generating, polysemous pile. Out of the rich dung heap of language come the generative play, the humor, and the seriousness that create the body of the text- a text which is nothing and everything. In Un Régicide, the gen- erative substance is not a dung heap, but the sea, i.e., water which ends in fog - wooly white, spongy, and wet. The contours of objects and people disappear: Autour de nous, le brouillard s'accumule, chaque jour un peu plus épais, un peu plus lourd, un peu plus impénétrable. . . . nous vivons désormais au sein d'une substance opaque et continue, qui nous étouffe insensiblement. . . . bientôt, me trouvant face à face avec mon meilleur ami, je ne reconnaîtrai plus ses traits. * Boris, whose story is told in the third person, records facts, factory details, electoral percentages, political happenings, the king's activities. In contrast, the narrative "je" registers the island's topography, seasonal changes, land- scapes, seascapes, meteorological variations, fantasies- sirens who come with the summer tides, bask in the sunshine by the edge of the sea, and then, once again, swim away as the autumnal fogs roll in. Boris' flat, prosaic world is a world of newspaper "facts" and figures. It is a reality outside the self, an "il" that correlates with the third-person singular pronoun. The world of the "je" is sensuous, contoured, full, fleshy, surrealis- tic. It is a landscape of the mind. It is inside. It is a self whose images blend reality, dream, and desire into the surrealism of Breton, Magritte, and Tanguy: love, mermaids, and the metamorphic landscapes of Brittany (where Tanguy and Robbe-Grillet once lived), a region whose magic had great appeal for Bre- ton (whose name he bears), a region on whose sandy beaches we are not sur- prised to find a tower of "objective chance," a Magritte mermaid, or Tanguy's gray, amorphous objects dissolving in the mist. "Nous les verrons [les sirè- nes] sortir des plis de l'onde lissant leurs cils et secouant en fines gouttelettes l'eau ruisselant de leurs épaules" (/*, pp. 128-29). Un Régicide, written at a time when existentialism and Sartre's literature of commitment were waxing strong, is Robbe-Grillet's answer to the writer's dilemma whenever he has to choose between his art and direct social action. It is clear, even in this first novel, not surprisingly, that Robbe-Grillet opts for art. "La vie politique nous oblige sans cesse à supposer des significations con- nues: significations sociales, significations historiques, significations morales. L'art est plus modeste- ou plus ambitieux-: pour lui, rien n'est jamais connu d'avance."2 The essays of the collection Pour un nouveau roman (written between 1955 and 1963) stress the fact that the artist should be committed only to his art, that form is content, that the writer, a priori, has nothing to</page><page sequence="3">BENSTOLTZFUS 271 say. Nevertheless, Un Régicide contains clichéd settings and situations which enhance expectations of terroristic, if not revolutionary, activity: factory workers, Laura's political involvements, the Church's machinations, presumed repressions by the King's regime, and, finally, Boris' elaborate plans and fan- tasies to assassinate the monarch. However, as in Projet pour une révolution à New York, the revolution Robbe-Grillet describes or advocates is not political, but artistic, linguistic, and psychological. In Projet, the color red generates arson, murder, and rape- themes which in turn generate the scenes, events, and images of the novel. Red is the sym- bolic color of the Revolution even if it is only linguistic. However, since the Revolution in Projet is psychological as well as artistic, its impact derives not from the coherence of its ideological doctrine, which is secondary and mini- mal, but from its assault on the norms of art and of established good taste. Indeed, when it was first published, the novel succeeded in offending practi- cally everybody. Girls are tortured, raped, and injected with fluids, while Black revolutionaries burn, pillage, and terrorize, even as other masked indi- viduals act out a variety of maddeningly contradictory roles. Although these activities correspond to revolutionary stereotypes, the author's real, though covert attack, like Roland Barthes's, is on langue, doxa, and myth. Unlike the Protean pronominal shifts in Projet, the narrative "il," the third- person singular pronoun of Un Régicide, strives for coherence according to traditional schemes, reproducing, as it were, Balzac's ideology of a bourgeois society at the beginning of the nineteenth century. But the narrative "je" constantly intrudes into the established order of the "il." Its acausality and achronology are a form of "disorder" disrupting the flow of the narrative. "Readerly" patterns in a conventional novel (plot, suspense, character, and chronology) are generally defined as order, while "writerly" variations from these norms are perceived as disorder. Accordingly, Robbe-Grillet believes there are two groups of artists: the first, like Balzac, who accept the world as it is and write realistic novels, while the second, through their parole, try to create a world which does not yet exist. Robbe-Grillet's art, which belongs to the second category, and unlike Balzac's art, is, therefore, no longer the langue of the system. It is a discourse against the system- a parole designed to under- mine, desacralize, and demythify the dogmas of the past, be they artistic, socio-political, religious, etc. Projet is "revolutionary" in this sense only, and Un Régicide, insofar as it anticipates the innovations of Projet, contributes to the "revolutionary" process: the intrigue is primarily metaphorical. Commentators sometimes affirm that Balzac's realistic novels reflected the relatively stable view of the metaphysical, socio-political, and philosophical hierarchies prevalent in Western Europe in the early nineteenth century. Even though readers knew Balzac was inventing his characters and his settings, it was still possible, they said, because of his realism, to believe in those inven-</page><page sequence="4">272 FRENCH FORUM tions as if they were true. This is no longer the case. In S/Z, Roland Barthes démythifies Balzac in general and Sarrasine in particular by linking the story's implied values to the bourgeois codes of the period. Robbe-Grillet in turn con- cludes that Balzac's realism is a realism of the past, that to write Balzacian or Dickensian novels with well-structured plots and full-blown characters is to write as though we were living in an era when illusions about religion, man, and the world were still tenable. The writing of Un Régicide is, therefore, an act of aggression against estab- lished literature and society's codes for which it stands; "je"'s disorder sub- verts the system. In the absence of any demonstrable assassination, this would seem to be the meaning of the title and the purpose of the novel.3 However, the duality and identity of the first- and third-person pronouns now seem conventional when compared to the fanciful manipulations in Projet, in which an "il" at the beginning of a sentence suddenly becomes a "je" speaking of the "il," who in turn, further on, becomes another "je." "Il y a comme une voix narratrice mobile," says Robbe-Grillet, "qui est en train de scintiller à travers le jeu du 'je.' "4 Such games now stress the artist's freedom and his determination to resist the structural determinism of language, though I doubt that in 1949, when he wrote Un Régicide, Robbe-Grillet had structuralism or the "ludique" in mind. Boris' "plans" are only "imaginations," fantasies which turn progressively inward; they are visions which are never "executed," except in his and in the reader's mind; the realism and descriptive detail of his inventions become as false or as real as they do in Kafka's works. These details are "false" in that they do not correspond to the urgencies of the class struggle or to the norms of the socialist-realism novel, whose content should, presumably, help free the oppressed proletariat. The details are "true," nevertheless, insomuch as they are the work of art- an art which would not exist without them. like EHdi and Gogo waiting for Godot, Boris and "je" invent happenings with which to pass the time of day. The theater is an illusion, the art of the novel is an illusion, but while they last these artifices create identities all their own -the only possible reality. Un Régicide cannot and does not have political repercussions. Its meaning, if it has a meaning, is probably metaphysical, social, and linguistic. Its significance, like Boris' illusory plottings, turns in- ward, plottings which curve into the self to become as unreal or as real as "je" 's mermaids. That is the magic of the "failure" of this work: "Aimone, . . . Amie, amande, anémone à la chair brillante; yeux d'argent, bouche sou- riante. Mon âme, mon amante Aimone" (R, p. 140). Artistically, Boris' love for Aimone is more compelling than the Revolution and Robbe-Grillet's alchemy of words more enchanting than the class struggle. Nevertheless, regardless of one's political convictions or artistic preferences, the climate of Un Régicide (the word "climate" seems particularly apt) derives</page><page sequence="5">BEN STOLTZFUS 273 from Kafka's labyrinths and the first-person narratives of La Nausée and L'É- tranger. Use of the first person, says Robbe-Grillet, as opposed to a third-per- son omniscient narrator, is a stage leading to the gradual disappearance of the Romantic hero: Kafka's initial K. in The Trial and the nameless husband in La Jalousie are its consequences: "Le roman paraît chanceler, ayant perdu son meilleur soutien d'autrefois, le héros. S'il ne parvient pas à s'en remettre, c'est que sa vie était liée à celle d'une société maintenant révolue" (PNR, p. 28). The nineteenth-century novel, Balzac's in particular, reflected the moral "or- der" of its day. Today's "nouveau roman" reflects the loss of arbitrary value systems. It reflects the disorientation of the twentieth century. Art before the twentieth century, like Newtonian physics, aimed at and believed in a unified whole. Man assumed that with science as his handmaiden he would one day be able to explain the world. However, with relativity, dis- continuity, and the indeterminate permeating all contemporary thinking, the old certitudes have been downgraded and man's value systems eroded. Con- temporary physicists, anthropologists, philosophers, theologians, and artists agree that the modern world has been changed, desacralized, and demythified. Many believe that God is dead and that life has no purpose; that man has been demysticized, reified, historicized; that he has been enticed by religion, abused by the production line, used by the Revolution. The moment Marx propounded the class struggle, the emphasis shifted from man to the economic and social structures which determine him. For Marx, at least, there was the certitude of History. Now, politics, history, and power, whether Capitalist or Communist, are perceived as oppressors on a global scale- a manipulation that undermines the substance of both history and man. If, since Nietzsche, traditional concepts of God, Nature, and Man have been "disappearing," then a new, reflexive, and doubting consciousness is replacing former absolutisms. In fact, the failure of our humanistic culture is one of the central problems of our times and the cause of our contemporary malaise. Man is painfully aware of bankrupt values and of his own finitude. If the mo- dernity of Hölderlin stands for thought which can dispense with language, then Kafka and Artaud stand for an artistic discourse in which the limits of reason are the limits of man himself. All that remains is violence, the cry, erot- icism, suffering, and regicide. Labyrinths, anti-heroes, and faceless protagonists are, therefore, the stock-in-trade of our contemporary desacralization and destabilization. However, the labyrinthine streets, corridors, and rooms of The Trial and The Castle express themselves in Un Régicide as foggy landscapes, bogs, and marshes- pastoral analogues for metropolitan alienation and ennui: Quelquefois, des hommes du village sont ainsi partis pour une course d'à peine une heure, et n'en sont jamais rentrés; mais peut-être errent-ils encore à travers l'île, hors des chemins connus, perdus dans le brouillard et la nuit. (*,p. 199)</page><page sequence="6">274 FRENCH FORUM Boris, like K., is "arrested" and "tried." In fact, Un Régicide echoes the incongruities of Kafka's novel. Boris carries a body in a knapsack, the two policemen vanish, Boris dumps the sack and the body on a trash heap, he is "acquitted" by a jury because the evidence of murder is either imaginary or not conclusive. Boris wants to be guilty, but he is not, and when we consider the "guilt" of Kafka's heroes, the difference is capital. Boris' third-person nar- rative is assimilated into the sensuous, sensory, and "innocent" world of the "je"- a world which opens or closes, depending on your perspective, onto the domain of language, into the "charged" atmosphere of adjective and metaphor. Like his existential paradigms, Meursault in L 'Étranger and Roquentin in La Nausée, Boris tries to cope with the ennui of a bourgeois Sunday. Meur- sault spends his free day sitting on a balcony, an alienated non-participant in the social, sportive, and amusement-oriented activities of Algiers' residents. Roquentin spends his Sunday wandering through Bouville, an ironic observer of the coded, stereotyped, and puppet-like behavior of the bourgeoisie. "Boris se demanda encore ce qu'il allait faire de cette journée de liberté, une journée de plus qui ne lui laisserait de toute façon, le lendemain, aucun souvenir" (R, p. 19). Though unwell, alienated, and sensitized to objects and to places, like his literary predecessors, Boris is, nevertheless, conscious of the enormous role language plays in structuring reality. When he reads an article in the news- paper describing the Church's "éclatante victoire," he imagines a brilliant me- teorite cleaving the heavens: "Une pierre raya le ciel comme un bolide et vint crever dans sa chute la surface tranquille d'un trou d'eau" (R, p. 30). Later, Boris "plays" with the ambiguity of the word "feuilles," as it applies to the "leaves" of trees and to the "pages" of a manuscript. The word "lame," mean- ing "blade" (the knife with which he "murders" the king) and "wave" (the sea), is used with the intensity and metaphoric ambiguity that Camus first gave it that fateful afternoon on the beach when Meursault murdered the Arab: Mais j'ai fait un pas, un seul pas en avant. Et cette fois, sans se soulever, l'A- rabe a tiré son couteau qu'il m'a présenté dans le soleil. La lumière a giclé sur l'acier et c'était comme une longue lame étincelante qui m'atteignait au front. Au même instant, la sueur amassée dans mes sourcils a coulé d'un coup sur les paupières et les a recouvertes d'un voile tiède et épais. Mes yeux étaient aveu- glés derrière ce rideau de larmes et de sel. Je ne sentais plus que les cymbales du soleil sur mon front et, indistinctement, le glaive éclatant jailli du couteau toujours en face de moi. Cette épée brûlante rongeait mes cils et fouillait mes yeux douloureux. C'est alors que tout a vacillé. La mer a charrié un souffle épais et ardent. Il m'a semblé que le ciel s'ouvrait sur toute son étendue pour laisser pleuvoir du feu.5 In his analysis of L 'Étranger Robbe-Grillet refers to Meursault's murder as a crime of passion (PNR, pp. 56-58). However, unlike Meursault's unpremed- itated crime, for which he blames the sun, Boris' is elaborately planned, but</page><page sequence="7">BEN STOLTZFUS 275 never executed. Nevertheless, the word "lame," as in L'Étranger, has its meta- phoric role to play. Boris imagines la cabine [de l'ascenseur qui] s'élevait avec un petit bruit régulier. [Il] examina la lame étroite; le roi portait, peut-être une cuirasse dissimulée. ... le bruit du moteur s'était arrêté. Boris se demanda s'il allait se rasseoir; mais ça ne l'intéres- sait pas beaucoup. Il suivait la tête minuscule qui s'éloignait insensiblement sur la mer. . . . Une lame lui éclaboussa les jambes. (R, pp. 164-65, my emphasis) This is metonymy, a juxtaposition of images whose reciprocity produces a poetic ambiguity comparable to metaphor. The metonymy of Un Régicide has philosophical roots in the metaphors of La Nausée and L "Étranger. In La Nausée, Roquentin notes the "râle heureux" of a fountain; the leath- er-covered seat of a trolley car is "un âne mort"; the Autodidact's hand is a "gros vers blanc." The chestnut tree is, of course, the object which receives the highest anthropomorphic charge: its metamorphoses go from an "ongle noir," to "cuir bouilli," to "grosse patte," to "peau de phoque," and on into nausea. In Z, 'Zfrraw^er, Meursault's evening is "comme une trêve mélancolique," the tar holes in the road are like a "chair brillante," the earth is "couleur de sang," the waves are "paresseuses," the promontory is "somnolent," and the sea "halète"; the reflection of the sun on the Arab's knife is like "une épée de lumière." His blade ("la lame") is an extension of the day which has "jeté l'ancre dans un océan de métal bouillant." The waves ("lames") of the sea "attack" Meursault with the heat, intensity, and threatening power of the "unfaithful" sun which is "gouging" ("fouillait") his eyes (PNR, pp. 57, 61). In "Nature, humanisme, tragédie," Robbe-Grillet explains Meursault's and Roquentin's behavior in terms of "tragic complicity" (PNR, pp. 45-68). If Ro- quentin feels nausea, if Meursault kills an Arab, and both feel alienated, it is because of the pernicious influence of metaphor. The language of adjective and metaphor, says Robbe-Grillet, breaks down the necessary distance between man and things, anthropomorphizes nature, and establishes an insidious connivance between man and the world. In Peau de chagrin, Balzac describes a "nappe blanche comme une couche de neige fraîchement tombée et sur laquelle s'élevaient symétriquement les couverts couronnés de petits pains blonds." Toute ma jeunesse, disait Cézanne, j'ai voulu peindre ça, cette nappe de neige fraîche. ... Je sais maintenant qu'il ne faut vouloir peindre que: s'élevaient symétriquement les couverts, et: les petits pains blonds. Si je peins: couronnés, je suis foutu, comprenez-vous? Et si vraiment j'équilibre et je nuance mes cou- verts et mes pains comme sur nature, soyez sûr que les couronnes, la neige et tout le tremblement y seront.6 The world is there and that is all, says Robbe-Grillet. The word "crowned" or the "majesty" of Mont Blanc are a function of language and history, a meta- phorical "contamination" he would eschew:</page><page sequence="8">276 FRENCH FORUM II n'est pas étonnant . . . que le phénomène littéraire par excellence ait résidé dans l'adjectif global et unique, qui tentait de rassembler toutes les qualités internes, toute l'âme cachée des choses. Le mot fonctionnait ainsi comme un piège où l'écrivain enfermait l'univers pour le livrer à la société. (PNR9 p. 22, my emphasis) Robbe-Grillet proposed a "cleansed" language incapable of leading man "astray" (towards nausea, murder, and what else: jealousy? sado-eroticism?). However, in spite of his theoretical pronouncements, characters like Mathias in Le Voyeur or the husband in La Jalousie do not see their environment through "cleansed" eyes. Holes, bits of string, a blue cigarette wrapper, waves, figure eights, for Mathias, generate the same "metaphoric" charge that objects and landscapes do for Roquentin and Meursault. A...'s black hair, the centi- pede, blue paper, and stains, in métonymie combinations, generate a "jealousy" comparable to the alienation and nausea of the two existential precursors. If metaphor is the analogic "detonator" (i.e., the figure eight of the string), it is essential to note that the first explosion is accompanied inevitably by a chain reaction which proceeds not by analogy (as metaphor would normally do), but by métonymie contagion. Hence, the compulsive proliferation of figure eights that "contaminate" Le Voyeur and multiply the contiguity of visual and affective associations. Even though Robbe-Grillet's characters live in a world of metonymy rather than metaphor, their bondage to things and lan- guage is analogous to Roquentin's and Meursault's. Nevertheless, the "climate" of Un Régicide is markedly different from the "climate" of La Nausée and L'Étranger because it displays a noteworthy absence of metaphoric and méto- nymie determinism. Boris, unlike Roquentin and Meursault, "plays" with ob- jects, adjectives, and metaphors in ways that suggest insight into the labyrinths of "tragic complicity." For instance, while walking through a trash dump, fol- lowing a path worn by the play of children (read: worn-out language whose arbitrary signs are as gratuitous as child's play), Boris notices a flat, horizontal tombstone whose inscription says: "Ci-git Red": A ce moment un coup de sifflet long et perçant retentit à ses oreilles en même temps que les trois mots se brouillaient, pour reparaître en une anagramme accusatrice: Régicide! (R,p. 58) The meteor that appears "out of the blue" to signal the presence of the adjective "éclatante," like the whistle signaling the anagram "Régicide," seems to call attention to the literary myth of "depth." Such wordplay suggests to me, among other things, a humorous and ironic commentary on Roquentin's unusual sensitivity to color (the purple suspenders, the black root of the chest- nut tree, etc.). While Roquentin's and Meursault's complicity with objects is "serious," reflecting "reality," Boris' is imaginary, arbitrary, and playful.</page><page sequence="9">BEN STOLTZFUS 277 Things give Roquentin's and Meursault's behavior a logical and plausible struc- ture, whereas Boris' fabricated assassination is based on manipulations of real- ity that are as fanciful as the mermaids with which he swims.7 Roquentin wanted something to happen as it would to a hero in a novel. Accordingly and ironically, Boris is both the persona and hero of the anony- mous "je": "Alors, j'aurais, enfin, découvert la terre. ... Le héros se retourna. Maurice . . . Mauritz . . . Boris ... Il se retourna dans son lit, pour regarder de nouveau le gros réveil rond" (/?, p. 13). "Je" 's invention of Boris can be read as a satire of Roquentin, who longs for adventure so that he can experience life- a life which, so far, has been subsumed and overshadowed by the "histor- ical presence," the biography he is writing, of the Marquis de Rollebon. Un Régicide is, in fact, full of humor. It spoofs language, reality, and its literary predecessors; yet it is also terribly serious, containing the kind of gravity that Beckett injects into works like The Lost Ones, works in which the encapsu- lated absurdity of human endeavor weighs man down with all the implications of a "dead end." Drowning is both the menace and the "dead end" of Un Ré- gicide: "peut-être, aurait-il fallu se laisser submerger par les vagues, emporter comme un noyé hors de cette chambre qui me prend peu à peu mes forces" (R, p. 13, my emphasis). If "the room" that is sapping the narrator's energy, in addition to the "huis clos" of the human condition, is also a metaphor for the imagination, i.e., the "writerly" process, then the "je"-novelist, aware of the complicity of things and the need for a "cleansed" language, must choose between the old referen- tial norms of fiction ("récupérer": the author's link with the world outside his fiction) and new, reflexive, non-referential codes of language that give art its self-contained autonomy (inside "the room"). Moreover, if the "nouveau nouveau roman" is reflexive, self-contained, and in large measure non-referen- tial, it is because, in desacralizing artistic conventions, it is replacing them with new, autonomous, non-mimetic forms that wish to rival reality, rather than copy it. If the world is no longer innocent and transparent, but opaque, then one way to overcome the determinism of things and events is to manipulate them or assemble them by creating "open" texts which, because they demand the reader's collaboration, lead him to choose, thereby manifesting his free- dom. At the end of his "bourgeois Sunday," Roquentin chooses to walk down one street rather than another. It is this limited and prosaic sense of choice that gives him a feeling of exaltation, a hightened sense of being, the satisfac- tion of existing like a hero in a novel. The dilemmas of metaphor and anthropomorphism will prompt readers inclined towards Mauron's psychocriticism to juxtapose Boris' use of the word "un noyé," quoted above, with the following sentence from /tow un nouveau roman: "Noyé [my emphasis] dans la profondeur des choses, l'homme finit par ne même les apercevoir; son rôle se limite bientôt à ressentir, en leur nom,</page><page sequence="10">278 FRENCH FORUM des impressions et des désirs- totalement humanisés" (p. 61). The depth of things and the "tragic complicity" of metaphor being identical, man can drown in language as he can in the sea. In fact, Un Régicide reads like an illustration of the philosophical ideas so carefully and controversially developed in the essay "Nature, humanisme, tragédie": "je serai mort, et il ne flottera même pas, à la surface, un petit morceau de bois pour en témoigner" (R, p. 224). Maurice Merleau-Ponty says that when we invest landscapes or other peo- ple with states of introspection like joy or sadness, it is because we have ob- served in ourselves the coincidence between these internal perceptions and the external signs associated with them. While this is knowledge, he says, it is also an impoverishment of perception, because the perceiving subject approaches the world as the scientist approaches his experiments. However, if we believe that these projections, associations, and transferences are based on some intrinsic characteristic of the object, then the "human world" no longer functions as a metaphor and becomes what it really seems to be: the home- land of our thoughts.8 It is precisely such an illusionist "homeland" that lin- guistics, structuralism, and Robbe-Grillet would avoid, lest man drown in the sea of metaphors which the language we have inherited constantly perpetuates. The atmosphere of drowning in Un Régicide (I use the word "atmosphere" deliberately) is both linguistic and metaphysical. Water, fog, and moisture per- meate everything, blurring objects, masking the landscape, confusing the in- habitants. "Trapped" by the insidious role of language, man can no longer discern whether he is in the world or whether the world is in him. This is the structural dialectic of a topology that condemns man to question the reality of the maze he himself has constructed: Où me suis-je donc fourvoyé dans cette brume? Dans quel labyrinthe me suis-je engagé? Est-ce un simple parc à brebis ou bien quelque piège que j'aurai tendu moi-même pour capturer des bêtes sauvages et dans lequel je me serai à mon tour laissé prendre? (R, p. 221) For labyrinthe read "language," for brebis read "following in other people's footsteps," for piège read "metaphor." Language, willy-nilly, structures per- ception, allowing us to communicate with the world in which we live. The way the artist uses language (langue), the way characters in a novel, a play, or a movie (Marienbad, for instance) are manipulated by the author's parole, the way we, as readers, react to langue and parole enable us to establish contact with the ontological dimensions of our internal selves and the external, phe- nomenological reality of things. If language, like primordial magma, is the stuff of every novel, then the "prison-house of language," to borrow Fredric Jameson's expression, the room in which Boris "dies," is also the "cellule géné- ratrice," the point of origin from which the lines of the novel take form, as they do, for example, in Souvenirs du triangle dfor, whose generative theme is</page><page sequence="11">BEN STOLTZFUS 279 a golden triangle-an image composed of two ideograms: gold and triangle. From this shape and this color the author generates all the subsidiary themes and the mythology of the novel. Thus, the shape of an inverted triangle and the atomic number for gold (79) allow Robbe-Grillet to generate numerical (one through nine), geometric (circles, parallel lines, and triangles), mytholog- ical (alchemy, the phoenix, secret societies), and carnal (sado-erotic images) forms. The narrator of Souvenirs, though imprisoned in his cell, "plays" with a mysterious and magical globe that enables him to "escape" at will to the "out- side" through a maze of verbal "slippages" and symbolic corridors. In fact, the closed rooms and external labyrinths of Robbe-Grillet's fictions, though interchangeable, are adumbrated by this passage from Un Régicide: La citadelle où je vis retranché, que depuis longtemps la mer sape et menace, chancelle déjà sous chacun de mes pas hésitants; tandis qu'au sommet du don- jon, dont l'eau maintenant atteint les crénaux en apparence intacts, j'accom- plirai lentement ma dernière ronde, je sentirai soudain se disloquer les pierres au milieu des vagues. Ce ne sera pas un écroulement spectaculaire; on ne verra rien de très remarquable, simplement une retombée, un bercement, un repos, et personne d'autre que moi n'en appréciera le scandale. (/?, p. 224) This prison cell, like the room, is a double metaphor: death cell for those who allow themselves to be imprisoned by the determinism of language, or the beginning of freedom (if we explore its dialectical topology) for those who refuse to "drown." There is also the idea of cell as a biological entity, for those artificers willing to play with it and thereby transcend its deterministic forces. If words, color, or images act as generative cells, then the novel itself (the word "itself containing the phoneme cell is a typical example of the new wordplay) develops a body (the body of the text) which writers like Claude Simon (Les Corps conducteurs), Robert Pinget (Passacaille), Jean Ricardou (La Prise de Constantinople), and Robbe-Grillet (Souvenirs du triangle d'or) explore using their pens (read "phalluses") with infinite variety, intriguing possibilities, and limitless care. Language in these novels, and in others like them, is treated as a body- a body of words whose corporeality and resource- fulness is a source of pleasure and delight. Textuality and sexuality are one. Roland Barthes speaks of a "langage tapissé de peau, un texte où l'on puisse entendre le grain du gosier, la patine des consonnes, la volupté des voyelles, toute une stéréophonie de la chair profonde." Barthes asks that writing aloud capture the "présence du museau humain" in order to throw the "corps ano- nyme de l'acteur dans mon oreille [où] ça granule, ça grésille, ça caresse, ça coupe: ça jouit."9 Les Corps conducteurs has frequent, graphically detailed descriptions of a phallus moving in and out of a vagina. In Passacaille, the manuscript for the</page><page sequence="12">280 FRENCH FORUM novel, rolled like a scroll, is pulled from the protagonist's fly, bloodied, as though it were a severed phallus. In La Prise de Constantinople, which is also La Prose de Constantinople, the city in which crusaders tarried on their way to the Holy Land is identified with a vagina whose hairy mantle becomes a flaming bush. In Projet pour une révolution à New York, arson, murder, and rape are also an assault on the text, comparable in some respects to Sade's assaults on his victims. Who is not familiar with the virginity of Mallarmé's white pages as yet unsullied by a pen, or of the sexual symbolism of writing which for Freud consists of releasing liquid from a pen onto blank paper? Der- rida, in De la grammatologie, analyzes in detail Rousseau's unconscious and symbolic correlation between writing and masturbation. Saussure, in his Cours de linguistique générale, in somewhat veiled terms, says that everything that is active in the psychological part of a circuit (as in writing) is executive and everything that is passive is receptive. Accordingly, the author of a text is the active master, the executive side speaking (parole), while language (langue) is passive, the receiver, the body that is manipulated and sometimes raped. Writing is a "loving," if sometimes aggressive, exploration of the body-fic- tion. This activity, like the multiplication and profusion of doors, windows, halls, and tunnels, will be a subsequent development of Robbe-Grillet's fiction, not yet manifest in Un Régicide. Though few in number, compared to his later works, Un Régicide does, nevertheless, describe enclosures of all kinds, includ- ing elevators and trolleys, Robbe-Grillet's embryonic labyrinths. These laby- rinths reflect the autonomy of language so dear to the structuralists, while also providing referential passageways to "reality." Robbe-Grillet's fiction is self-reflexive, yet it "connects" with the outside. It weaves its spell, yet it delivers. The labyrinths are linguistic-verbal constructions of the author's parole-yet we recognize these labyrinths-be they houses, palaces, cities, gar- dens, beaches, or bogs-as places in which we may also lose our way. If gal- leries, patios, cells, wells, basements, attics, and winding staircases are traps for the protagonists, they are also our traps. We too wander through the streets, plazas, waterways, subways, cemeteries, islands, plantations, and marshes with which Robbe-Grillet constructs his labyrinthine world. In spite of the mazes he creates, his play with language, clichés, and social codes pro- vides liberating corridors to the outside, stressing the author's freedom and the reader's option to take advantage of this opening out of the prisons of language, history, biology, geography, and time. His labyrinths are both closed and open. Umberto Eco, in L 'Oeuvre ouverte, believes that this dialectic between the inside and the outside actualizes the artist's desire to keep the channels of communication open. While soliciting our collaboration, Robbe-Grillet's works draw our attention to these openings. They are the text's scaffolding, "writ- erly" devices that emphasize the work's reflexive nature, as well as the possi-</page><page sequence="13">BENSTOLTZFUS 281 bility of transcending it, of experiencing the to-and-fro movement of the crea- tive process- of participating in the dialectic between the self and the other -in short, in structuring an active inner-outer dialogue. The artist's parole is the inside. Langue, those socio-historical codes the artist uses to transmit his message, is the outside. The reader connects from the outside with the author's parole at the center of the text, which is a laby- rinth, where he recreates order out of apparent chaos. With luck, intuition, and imagination, the reader navigates the passageways without being "devoured," or "shot," or "destroyed," following Robbe-Grillet's dialectical topology as it moves freely between the inside and the outside of the rooms, buildings, cor- ridors, and streets. The text is the body on which the reader imprints his own creative urge. It is a coupling which enables him to recognize his freedom- a coupling of the self with the "other" eliciting the "bliss" that emanates from the "writerly" text. Robbe-Grillet's labyrinths open up, however, only if the reader works his way through the language, the imagery, and the doxas that obstruct his pas- sage. The reader's acts of collaboration enable him to find a center, and having found it, there, like the king-god of Antiquity, he overcomes death, renews life, and recreates himself. He is his freedom. If the room is a potential labyrinth in a cellular form, then inner and outer worlds are interchangeable. This "slippage" ("Le décor, que plus rien ne rete- nait, glissa peu à peu vers le pays des brumes" [R, p. 20]), characteristic of the film and of its title, Glissements progressifs du plaisir, is typical of the constant and reciprocal contact between inner and outer worlds, between the reader and the text, between pleasure and bliss. "Il faut donc unir ou réconci- lier les deux présentations (Darstellung) du dedans et du dehors," says Derrida in Glas. 10 Robbe-Grillet's doors, windows, rooms (they need not necessarily open) signal transitions of the mind and of the imagination whose purpose it is, alternately, to trap protagonists in the nets of passion and metaphor, or to free them, if they can transcend the images of their compulsions or escape from the prison walls of language. Un Régicide has not yet exteriorized the obsession of La Jalousie, the sado-erotic clichés of Trans-Europ-Express, or the mythology of Souvenirs du triangle d'or, in which, at last, as Derrida wants, the images of the conscious and the subconscious worlds have been combined. In La Jalousie the banana plantation is an emotional labyrinth in which objects act both as catalysts and objective correlatives for jealousy. In due course, the centipede becomes a metaphor. The title Trans-Europ-Express generates the prevailing imagery of contemporary mythology. It is a metaphor of fear, sex, and death. Transes is the title of an imaginary thriller. Europ is the title of a fictitious sex magazine, while the real copy of L Express that is featured in the film is a special issue on "L'Homme qui est mort quatre fois."</page><page sequence="14">282 FRENCH FORUM Of course, the Trans-Europ-Express is also the Paris- Antwerp train in which the author is generating this piece of pop fiction. The sado-erotic imagery of Souvenirs enables the reader to penetrate the sex of the text with seven burn- ing candles, thus opening the door of the "sanctuary" of the temple whose name is "Le Triangle d'or." In 1949, Un Régicide was a long way from the sexual imagery, generative themes, and serial permutations of the "nouveau nouveau roman." At that time Robbe-Grillet was concerned more with metaphysical ennui and the met- aphors of language than he was with the imagery of the subconscious. Exteri- orizing subconscious images will be a subsequent development in which he connects the imagery of man's inner world with the outer imagery of advertis- ing, the funnies, sex magazines: "Ces images de viols, de supplices, de femme- objet ou de sang répandu, notre société les a dans la tête; ce que je fais, c'est les renvoyer, au grand jour, à leur platitude d'images de mode."11 The humor of Un Régicide is less mordant than it is in Robbe-Grillet's recent works. Nevertheless, it is constant, as is the call of the sirens on the lovely beaches of this universal island. Robbe-Grillet's initial semi-humorous attack on language and the conventional novel will, in time, strive to over- come the barriers of language and, through irony and a mock sado-eroticism, satirize the foibles and compulsions of modern man: "II ne s'agit donc pas de fermer les yeux sur le sexe et la violence, ni de les condamner, mais de les organiser au sein d'une 'parole' vivante."12 Thus, rape, murder, and fire in Projet pour une révolution à New York are larger-than-life projections of the news, of advertising, and of our once-subconscious selves. One of the dilem- mas that Robbe-Grillet's art thus attempts to resolve is the violence, passion, and imagery engendered by our private and public worlds-worlds imprisoned by the tyranny of words. Art, for Robbe-Grillet, is the key with which to unlock the prison door. Art not only communicates with freedom, but its play is also freedom. In fact, the space where langue and parole collide, the proscenium of avant-garde fiction, is a play in which parole's assault on langue dramatizes the freedom of the artist and the bondage of the repressed material. The tortured bodies in Robbe-Grillet's fiction, like the distortions of the text itself, have no other function than to manifest this drama. Un Régicide, also the name of a "per- formance" in Souvenirs du triangle dfor at the Golden Triangle Opera House, in spite of its paradoxical title, has engendered new life. It was a cell from which Robbe-Grillet's subsequent works emerged. The king is dead. Long live the king. The University of California, Riverside</page><page sequence="15">BEN STOLTZFUS 283 1.
