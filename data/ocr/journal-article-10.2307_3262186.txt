<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Jahwe als Krieger: Studien zum alttestamentlichen Gottesbild, by Henning Fredricksson. Lund (Sweden): C. W. K. Gleerup, 1945. Pp. xii+131. Kro- nor 7,50. This is a doctoral dissertation presented to the theological faculty of the University of Lund. The author found no monograph on this subject and set out to suply the lack. The work is divided into two parts: I, Yahweh as the leader of an army; II, Yahweh as an individual fighter. First, the conceptions of Yahweh as a military leader may be divided into three: the tribal god, the god of Sinai, and the god of the land (residing in heaven). The tribal-god idea, common to all West Semites, was brought into Canaan from the desert. When the tribes were welded together into a people or nation, Yahweh became a national god, or god of a people. The tribal god is ipso facto a war god and military leader. Hence, the tribal-god idea is more primitive and fundamental than that of the war god. The Sinai god was a new conception. He was originally a nature god, con- nected with Mt. Sinai, awe-inspiring, using thunder and lightning, given to theophanies to aid his people, more fearsome and dangerous than the com- panionable tribal god. He appeared to Moses, who identified him with the tribal god, and thus the two became mixed in the tradition. But the char- acteristics of the Sinai god persisted. He tended to stay at Sinai, coming out only on occasion. He made the covenant, which the people had to keep or lose him. He was vengeful and primitive. The great prophets developed this god into the god who would carry out his purposes regardless of Israel, the military god who might lead forces against Israel, the world god, the lord of history. Yet the anthropomorphic wording used even by the prophets is sometimes more from the tribal-god tradition than from that of the Sinai god. Yahweh as god of the land, but residing in heaven, is a new departure found in the J and E documents. This god makes himself known through oracles, dreams, and the like. During the later monarchy, there developed, under foreign influence, the idea of Yahweh the heavenly king with a court of angels or heavenly bodies (Assyrian astral influence). The author summarizes thus: as tribal god, Yahweh the warrior is primarily the commander who leads his people in battle; as Sinai god and covenant god he appears in the same role, though often having by his side various forces of nature; finally, as sky god he directs the military operations through coun- sels which he gives to the leaders of the people by means of oracles; as sky 238</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS god, also, he directs the battle through the various powers, forces of nature, angels and demons which he sends out. Second, the conceptions of Yahweh as an individual warrior may also be divided into three: the fighter against the chaos dragon, the battling daemon, and the war god who fights in single combat. The dragon-fighting idea of Yahweh is non-Israelite, being connected with the Babylonian myth of Marduk and Tiamat. The battling-daemon idea, which occurs only sporadi- cally, is also of non-Israelite origin, being a survival of a pre-Yahwistic stage of folk religion. But the idea of Yahweh, the war god in single combat, is Israelite. Along with portrayals of the war god leading his people, we find certain passages suggesting single combat, e. g. Deut 1 80 and 20 4. There are also passages connected with the Sinai tradition, in which the mere appearance of the fear- some deity is enough to confound any enemy. In conclusion, the author discusses the role of the idea of Yahweh as a warrior in Old Testament theology and in the religious life of Israel. (a) It has given Yahweh the stamp of a live, active deity. (b) It led the way to monotheism by emphasis on the great power of Yahweh. This great power eventually became omnipotence. (c) It caused also other qualities to be attributed to Yahweh, such as holiness (in the primitive sense), fearsome- ness, strength, craftiness, and wisdom. (d) Certain emotions were attributed to the deity, such as anger, jealousy, vengefulness and delight in destruction and bloodletting. The martial spirit, so strong in early Israel, gradually died out, until there is hardly any trace of it in the Wisdom Literature. Nevertheless, the idea of Yahweh as a warrior left certain valuable deposits in the religious life of Israel. Most important is the conception of divine power. Since this power was exercised on behalf of Israel, the Israelites were thankful. There arose the custom of songs of praise to God, a custom of continuing value. But the divine power was exercised not only on behalf of Israel, but also against Israel when Israel sinned. Thus, in the teaching of the prophets, Yahweh the warrior was changed from a tribal deity into an omnipotent warrior for righteousness. But, says the author, Yahweh also was gracious and merciful to his people, and these qualities too reside, in the last analysis, in the power of a god con- ceived as a warrior. And from this conception of the power of Yahweh comes also the idea of a god who is a very present help in trouble, an idea of the greatest value in the religious life of the invidual, as we see in the Psalms. 239</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE The author has produced an interesting and well-written little book. Per- haps at the end there is a slightly overstrained attempt to attach too much historical and theological importance to the warrior-god idea. Even so, one must remember that "Onward Christian Soldiers" is still a popular and perhaps even a useful hymn. W. F. STINESPRING Zephanja: Textkritisch und literarisch untersucht, by Gillis Gerleman. Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1942. xii+135 pp. Kr. 10. This study by a pupil of Johannes Lindblom was presented as a doctoral dissertation to the University of Lund in Sweden. It is gratifying to learn that work of high quality in the Old Testament field was being done in that country during the war years, although copies of books then published have come to us only since the end of hostilities. This work is divided into four parts: (1) A running commentary on the text of Zephaniah. This section records all the deviations from MT in LXX, Peshitta, and Vulgate (and occasionally the Coptic); seeks to determine the correct text; and presents some exegetical observations. (2) A translation of that portion of the prophecy which G. believes to be genuine, secondary portions being relegated to small type in footnotes. (3) General characteriza- tion of the three principal ancient versions - LXX, Peshitta, and Vulgate. (4) An interpretation of Zephaniah against his historical background. The attitude of Gerleman toward the traditional Massoretic text is con- servative. He states this frankly in the preface, and exhibits such an attitude in his treatment of the versions. As a general rule he prefers to accept MT, if it is at all possible to make sense of it, rather than emend on the basis of LXX or another ancient version. He is also conservative in eliminating secondary material from the prophecy. The only passages considered as not genuine are (apart from minor glosses and some variants within MT): 1 1-3, 17al, 18b; 2 10-11; 3 8bj-10, 17c-20. The elimination of 1 2-3, l8b; 2 10-11; and 3 8b is due to his view that Zephaniah did not predict world-wide destruc- tion, but directed his condemnation against certain classes in Jerusalem and against certain foreign nations. Among the significant points of translation and exegesis, one may single out the interpretation of insn'ry l~rnn'i in 1 9. Following a suggestion made years ago by Winckler, Gerleman proposes to render the phrase "alle die auf das Podium steigen". (The usual translation is "all who leap over 240</page></plain_text>
