<plain_text><page sequence="1">C. A. HOOKER SYSTEMATIC REALISM 1. Introduction: three revolutions in the philosophy of science To be a Scientific Realist is not easy - it requires that science be taken realistically, hence seriously. Formally, Scientific Realism is a semantical thesis, it is the view that the intended and proper sense of the theories of science is as literal de scriptions of the physical world, as saying what there is and how it behaves. It is the view that if a scientific theory is in fact true then there is in the world exactly those entities which the theory says there is, having exactly those characteristics which the terms of the theory describe them as having.1 By Systematic Realism I mean Realism embedded in the repertoire of supporting philosophical doctrines which together provide a systematic view of man's activities, in particular of his scientific activities. For Sci entific Realism, like any other significant philosophical doctrine, does not stand alone but is linked in an intimate fashion into a variety of other philosophical and scientific doctrines which are mutually compatible and mutually supportive (or which, if wrongly chosen, would prove mutually incompatible and disruptive). The point of defending Scientific Realism is not simply to insist on a 'right' conception of the semantics of theory. The point of defending it is because it is part of a coherent account of the entire human animal and the world in which he lives. According to our best contemporary theories, humankind evolved slowly from more 'primitive' origins. This evolution was, for us, most importantly a conceptual evolution in the broadest sense - man emerged into consciousness of his world. But the evolution is fundamentally a neurophysiological one, an evolution radiat ing from the primitive perceptual centre - and its physiological origins lie even deeper in the skill of survival. Philosophers and scientists aim at giving a reasonable account of this evolution, which must therefore in Synthese 26 (1974) 409-497. All rights Reserved Copyright ? 1974 by D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">410 C. A. HOOKER elude the physical evolution of the living world, in particular humankind, the evolution of language and thought, of consciousness, of science, of values and the general culture. Furthermore it must be a reflective ac count, it must explain why the account is reasonable. But knowledge and reason have themselves evolved, both in dynamic interaction with science and the general culture. Because of the evolution of the former our under standing of what reasonableness consists in has itself evolved. So Scientific Realism then is to play an integral part in the construction of a natural istic, evolutionary epistemology, evolving in dynamic interaction with science itself, and in the construction of a naturalistic, evolutionary ac count of mind, of the use of concepts, of language and thought, both linking smoothly into the scientific picture to form the unbroken web of our world-view. Of course this goal is Utopian, our ignorance is too great and epistemological evolution too rapid to hope to complete the task, but nothing less than this goal provides the proper perspective in which to view the defence of Scientific Realism. Its defence as an isolated thesis can only be hopelessly truncated because the stature of the issues is so reduced - in this form it belongs to boring academia rather than to the exciting evolution of the planet. Let us be quite clear about the implications of what I have just said for the exposition of philosophies of science. According to this view, alter natives to Realism, e.g. Empiricisms, Conventionalisms, themselves con stitute world views, in the sense of containing (albeit sometimes only implicitly) all of the components mentioned above. And when the Real ism/opponents issue is argued back and forth it is the entire world views of the opposed alternatives that are brought to the attack. Indeed, if we agree ( counter jactually) to construe Realism strictly as just the semantical thesis outlined in the second paragraph and to restrict argument to strictly the semantical level then I do not know of a single argument against (or distinctively for) Realism that has ever been advanced (or for or decisively against any other purely semantical view for that matter). The reason is simple enough - each view, even those which (unlike Realism) wish to tamper with theoretical terms, can surely set down a consistent syntax and semantics for their version of science (i.e. specify a language structure and define reference, denotation, satisfaction, truth in the usual model theoretic fashion), and in the cases where the semantics prevents exact reconstruction of the customary language of science simply deny that the</page><page sequence="3">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 411 residue belongs to science proper. I do not see how to refute any such normative position in itself, since nothing is argued and consistency is granted. No, what occurs in the literature are proposals for semantics, and arguments against proposed semantics, based upon other considerations, e.g. upon epistemological desiderata. Realism as such has never been ar gued against directly, only indirectly through the world view in which it is embedded (and so long as the alternatives to Realism remain norma tively hard-nosed about the definition of science, the same is true for them). Moreover, this procedure has been fair enough, in my view, be cause of the intimate way in which semantical theses are in fact linked to the remainder of a world view. This then is my first revolution in philosophy of science (it is a 'little' one) : to recognize explicitly the larger context in which Realism is eval uated. I shall hope thus to escape from the misleading and confusing nature of much writing on the subject which leaves these connections only tacit. I shall be aiming to explore a Realist world view both to see which combinations of doctrine are possible and which is the most plaus ible among them. But one can only offer up that latter doctrine for the acceptance of the rational man - precisely because it and its non-Realist alternatives constitute esentially entire world views I can see no way to further argue the issues. To those who value argued resolution above all else there remains the challenge: find a neutral meta-language in which the issues between the alternatives don't reduce to value judgments among components of world views (e.g. preferred epistemologies) that cannot be further argued for (assuming each set of value judgments self-consistent). Incidentally, if I am right about this then it constitutes a strong argument for what Feyerabend said long ago and everyone ignored (or failed to grasp) : the choice of an epistemology (enlarge this to world view) is in some sense an ethical choice, (see [63]).2 A second, larger revolution in philosophy of science is that now being brought about by Feyerabend, Hanson, Kuhn, Lakatos, Toulmin, and their ilk (cf. [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [44], [45], [81], [82], [131], [132]), and by many other factors, cf. my comments on the third revolution below. Traditional philosophy of science regards science as an abstract structure, specified in abstract linguistic terms. As such it is entirely sep arated from any activity of the scientist qua human being; one does not consider the psychology of discovery relevant, only the 'problem of in</page><page sequence="4">412 C. A. HOOKER duction', one does not consider the decision process for testing theories and choosing among them (which involves all kinds of value judgments, as well as judgments of other kinds), one considers only 'objective' criteria of acceptance and rejection. The consequence has been 'rational recon structions' of the history of science which entirely ignore large segments of it (discovery is irrational) and in which scientists habitually contradict the alleged canons o? Science (e.g. by retaining a refuted theory). Science is not a human discipline, except accidentally. When we press this view on the issue of fostering insight into the course of science on this planet we discover a tacit ideology lying beneath it: The science of science should also be Science. But this leads to the exclusion of all that is importantly human from the account, since most of the human activity cannot be captured in the combination of basic descriptive statement plus logical machinery. Indeed, the approach fails on its own terms since, even be haviouristically construed, specific scientific theories (e.g. of psychology) are needed to give an account of how science is possible for human beings, thus completing an epistemological circle in what was designed to be a rigorously logically (hence epistemologically) linear space, the space of scientific ascent to knowledge. As against this abstractive approach the new revolution proposes placing (or re-placing) the scientist at the centre of the social-intellectual-ethical complex known as science. It proposes first studying the scientist, his knowledge and values, principles of rational action, ideological and social position, metaphysical beliefs etc. in order to understand him (or her!), then once a rational account of the lives of scientists has been offered we can turn to the task of asking in what measure an abstract notion of Science can be rescued from the collective participations of scientists. The detailed, systematic development of this approach lies in the future, what Feyerabend and Kuhn have done has been to offer us glimpses of the great power of this re-orientation where e.g. what was irrational vis-?-vis Science (even though it affected its course profoundly) can now be seen to be rational vis-?-vis the scientist, where the profound links between the psychology of perception and linguistic usage in reporting can now be properly integrated with the logic of theory support and where the intimate interaction between scientific decisions, scientist's values and social and cultural conditions now receives a natural place with the proper importance.3</page><page sequence="5">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 413 This essay is written with this new approach explicitly in mind. This is not to say that I explicitly reconstruct a Science from an account of scientists, for this concerns mainly methodology and the application of epistemology to the logic of acceptance. But I do attempt to construct a Realism which is ready to be grafted on to this account of science. In particular, the intimate role which the scientific account of perception plays in the establishment of an epistemology and semantics, indeed the way in which the theory of rationality and epistemology are made to learn from psychology, are designed to make way for a 'humans at the centre' approach. Elsewhere I have been concerned with the application of this view to the future of scientists (see [73]). It is precisely the shift to a naturalistic epistemology and theory of rationality that constitutes the third revolution. To repeat: it is an in disputable fact that over the course of the development of science our philosophical theories have also been changing in response to scientific discovery. One only has to look at the philosophy of Bacon, Descartes and Locke e.g. to realize that what was at stake there was nothing less than the intellectual rationalization of the triumph of reason in science over faith. The foundations for the future course of Empiricism, and later of Conventionalism, were laid here as part of the programmatic attempt to comprehend and integrate the 'new' way to knowledge and the picture of man that was emerging from it, just as Instrumentalism had earlier emerged from the debate in astronomy. And so it has been ever since. Recent research in perception has taught us much concerning the extent of the 'interpretation' the mind introduces, it has rendered ludicrous the notion of pre-occurring conceptualized data; recent advances in physics have destroyed the synthetic a priori of Kantian space (cf. [58], [110]). The advent of quantum theory has cast doubt on the nature and appli cability of classical logic (cf. the status of geometry vis-?-vis relativity theory). Advances in neurophysiology and psychiatry, and even purely formal advances (e.g. in decision theory) have modified our concept of rational behaviour. And so one could continue. And yet ironically Empiricism and Conventionalism themselves are not able to cope with this feedback from science to philosophy. For they assume a rigid intellectual hierarchy in which philosophical doctrine stands above and before empirical discovery and cannot be touched by it, rather is it the a priori touchstone for understanding and evaluating empirical dis</page><page sequence="6">414 C. A. HOOKER covery. Thus logic, induction (read confirmation theory), semantics etc. were all assumed given a priori in philosophy. A fortiori epistemology and theory of language and rationality were assumed provided a priori in philosophy. It is not therefore possible for philosophy to learn from sci ence. This rigid hierarchy had one great advantage, no question of episte mological circularity arose. It has two disadvantages, it did not match experience and it gave no plausible answer to the question of the origin of a priori knowledge. But there is abroad now another, contrasting conception of the situation which takes seriously the contributions of those sciences which apply to human beings. We might call this the 'new epistemology' and 'new ra tionality'.4 The central contention of both doctrines is that the philosoph ical theories involved here are in no better position than our best scientific theories of the relevant human capacities. Rational minds are well-func tioning minds where the latter term belongs to the (ultimately) unified science of neuro-psycho-physiology. Similarly what human beings can know and how they come to know it are questions belonging to the same theory. According to philosophical tradition after Descartes, i.e. when the 'epistemological turn' began, epistemology was prior to science. Un happily, the progress of science revealed that such epistemologies were almost invariably based on poor armchair psychology - and no wonder, given our self-ignorance during most of the period. In similar fashion, philosophy made the attempt to dictate what is rational in advance of understanding how the mind works. It will be well to also bear in mind the changes which this shift brings with it. First of all there arises the necessity for a clear account of the dynamic interaction between normative and descriptive systems. Where epistemology and rationality belonged to first philosophy this was un necessary since the relationship was strictly asymmetrical - First Philo sophy was a critic of science; but now that the two interact we must in quire how it is that human beings may alter their principles of action rationally, even their criteria for rational action, in the light of experience. This great task lies outside the scope of this paper, but I want to point out that this forms here a second bridge between epistemology (and ra tionality) and ethics, for in each case we have normative systems in dynamic interaction with experience. Likewise in the spirit of unity,</page><page sequence="7">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 415 epistemology and the theory of rationality come much closer together. In the traditional philosophy it was supposed to be rational to reason in the fashion epistemology dictated, to be sure, but the effective integration of the two notions was small indeed. Now we have an entirely new setting for these issues : a man will have a variety of goals and various utilities attached to them and to the consequences of the various means to achieve them, these will include epistemic goals; what it is rational for him to do will be determined on the one side by the general nature of human beings, their capacities etc. and the circumstances in which he finds himself and on the other by some decision principles, such as the maximization of utilities. This model will hold for actions to realize epistemic goals (e.g. creation of a scientific theory) as for others. Which epistemic goals it is rational to choose will of course in its turn be a function of our nature and circumstances on the one side and critical reflection on the process of acquiring knowledge (in the light of historical experience and theory) on the other. In this context many of the traditional concerns of philosophy are radically re-cast. Perhaps the most important change is that in our approach to observation. Whereas traditional philosophy placed great emphasis on the a priori analysis of sensation because of its epistemolog ical role, this pressure is entirely absent here and with it goes any special concern over sensory atomism versus gestalt wholeness, or pure sensa tion vs. interpretation by the mind - rather we are free to accept the findings of psychology as to what to count in any circumstances as ob servable. Correlatively, the notion of an observation sentence and its re lation to theory is freed, to await informing by psychology and history; in principle all positions from a factual empiricist-style permanence to Feyerabendian pragmatic adjustment are open (cf. below). This in turn opens up a range of possible semantical positions concerning theory, de pending upon the deliverances of psychology concerning human thought processes and the nature (if any) of meaning.5 In future, any interesting epistemology and theory of rationality for science will have to take the feedback from science into account. What we have is the logical form of a circle from an empiricist point of view; actually, it is a spiral extending along the historical time axis: episte mological theory evaluates scientific method, scientific discovery informs epistemological theory. A similar spiral operates for our conception of rationality. As I pointed out earlier, one of the consequences of adopting</page><page sequence="8">416 C. A. HOOKER this line is the rejection of the old empiricist dualism between abstract philosophic criteria of justification for scientific theories and psychological accounts of individual scientists devising and defending those theories. The present view dovetails with the development of a naturalistic episte mology and theory of rationality that would unify the account of science.6 Another consequence is that the unit of empirical significance must now be considered as not just the whole of science and metaphysics, but the whole of philosophy and science. Given that our world view is at all cohe rent, and apriorism rejected, we might have expected these consequences. The tools for forging the new theory of the scientific enterprise are, however, already being formed; we are developing decision theory, gen eral systems analysis, policy science and related areas, and the psychology of perception and correlative theories of linguistic usage are now in creasingly well understood - for more comment and reference material see my [73], cf. [140]. I digress here long enough to remark on the partic ular application of this new orientation to another old problem in the formal philosophy of science, the problem of induction. The inductive enterprise seems to have evolved through three stages. In the first stage a quasi-logical machinery was sought such that, upon being fed 'the facts' at one end, it would generate the true theory of them at the other (or, in a later modification, the truest theory of them). In the second stage this goal was given up as impossible and what was substituted was the goal of specifying a calculus of confirmation of some sort that would attach a degree of support or confirmation of some sort to theories. In some ver sions (e.g. Carnap's) acceptability meant probability of truth, in others (e.g. Popper's) not; in all quantitative versions I happen to have looked at, the inductive calculus was essentially a set of probabilistic inference rules of some kind. The more sceptical inductivists of this stage 2 mold de cided that the most that could be achieved by this means was a compara tive assessment of relative acceptability between theories rather than an absolute acceptability. Stage 3 appears when this approach is set aside as too specialized and the problem re-formulated as a decision problem for scientists rather than a formal problem for Science. This issue now be comes "Given my present circumstances and utilities, which theories should I accept (i) for belief and practical reliance, (ii) for testing next?". Here one assumes that epistemic circumstances and utilities will play a key role. (Notice that the two decisions called for may concern very dif</page><page sequence="9">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 417 ferent theories-a point often overlooked in the presentation of methodol ogies !) In this new context formal methods of assessment constructed for the earlier problem may again play specialized roles as the occasion demands. Here too, one can obtain a more unified approach to the vari ous so-called paradoxes of support (paradoxes of confirmation, inductive inconsistencies, lottery paradox, Goodman's new riddle of induction) by seeing them as all placing constraints upon the consistent formulation of a theory of rational action, especially the sub-theory of rational accep tance. In what follows I shall say no more about the 'problem of induc tion', the reader will understand that, whatever the final form of a theory of rational decision-making we are able to formulate, my Realism as sumes a stage 3 formulation of the issue.7 This essay is written then against the backdrop of these three recent revolutions in philosophy of science. In a sense, the most important part of the essay has been written, the rest being detail. The reader is fore warned that this larger context at times affects the canons of acceptable attack and defence considerably. (E.g. it is too easy, on occasion, to mis take a legitimate rebuttal of framework for an attack ad hominem.) It is my hope, though it is perhaps unlikely, that the specific Realist doctrine to follow, will do justice to the breadth and unity of these three large scale changes which promise so much. 2. The empiricist alternative Since historically Realists have been largely put on the defensive by the domination of the empiricist tradition, it is appropriate to digress at the outset to briefly characterize the empiricist approach, the better to ap preciate the origins of the chief objections to Realism. Historically, the central dogma of Positivist-Empiricism (P-Empiri cism) was the Lockean doctrine of ideas, and specifically that all ideas originated in either sensation or reflection. Let us call this the first dogma. This doctrine gave rise to the second dogma, that all claims can be ex clusively and exhaustively divided into empirical and analytic claims (their origins, but more importantly, their justification, being grounded re spectively in sensation and reflection) and to the third dogma that all empirical concepts (i.e. concepts putatively descriptive of the world) be analyzable without remainder in terms of the class of simple, ostensively</page><page sequence="10">418 C. A. HOOKER defined concepts given directly in observation. These latter two doctrines, which state the semantical core of P-Empiricism, then serve as the founda tion of the epistemological core of P-Empiricism, namely (fourth doc trine) that all empirical knowledge is grounded in indubitable, simple observational claims and all analytic knowledge a priori. It is an imme diate consequence of these doctrines, especially of dogma 2, that inductive support is a purely logical relation holding between evidence and hy pothesis.8 This foundational epistemology is a (is the) most important instance of the 'Doctrine of the Given' and P-Empiricism is completed if we add the fifth dogma of Phenomenalism: the referent of the simplest observational descriptions are the simple sensory ideas in the mind (or sensations, or more recently, sense data). Behind the dogmas lies a tacit psychology, the 'arena for sensations plus logical machine only' view of mind and the correlative up-from tabula-rasa-via-sensory-imprinting-and-logical-manipulation theory of concept and belief acquisition. Hume brought the view to its logical com pletion with his non-cognitivist theory of ethics and aesthetics, agnostic theory of religion, dissolution of the person and inductive scepticism. The power of this position lies in its presentation of a clear-cut seman tics and epistemology of science, but supremely in its avoidance of episte mological risk - for from the above doctrines it follows that, for every empirical claim, the truth conditions for the claim coincide with the epistemic conditions of acceptance for that claim, and both lie in the realm of simple observation. Let us call this latter, powerful result the Coincidence Theorem of P-Empiricism. The dogmas of P-Empiricism are not mutually entailing, so it is open to a person to adopt fewer than all; as a matter of fact there has been an historical tendency to divide between dogmas 1, 3, 5 and dogmas 2, 4.9 More recent Empiricism has dropped all but dogmas 2 and 3 and a weaker version of 4 that follows if the analytic-synthetic distinction is retained but either of the indubitability and/or aprioriness claims dropped (although the latter is more likely to be defended than the former). A weaker version still (PP-Empiricism) replaces the 'be analyzable without remainder in terms of in dogma 3 by 'attain whatever semantic content they possess through their logical relations to the members of. (There is a further weaking of dogma 3 that would add to this last clause 'and/or through implicit definition by the theoretical postulates', but to the extent</page><page sequence="11">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 419 that this notion is clear at all it endangers the empiricism of Empiricism.) The beauty of the full-blown doctrine is its comprehensiveness and unity, the more one weakens the position the less philosophically interesting it becomes, it becomes in fact a fragment in search of a 'world-view'. Any of these versions of Empiricism provide sufficient grounds for in troducing the observational/theoretical distinction as fundamental to the analysis of science. They differ only in the conservatism with which they treat the specifically theoretical part of theories : P-Empiricism and Em piricism reduce this part entirely to the observational part, they support in this context the 'Verifiability Criterion of Meaning' (dogma 3 restated); JRT-Empiricism does not reduce away the theoretical part but leaves it as an in-principle second class superstructure parasitic on the observational part for sense and function - an inviting target for would-be Instrumen talists. (P-Empiricism and Empiricism essentially admit only one induc tive argument, that of generalization from instances, PF-Empiricism has a much richer, if more problematic, inductive structure.)10 All variants of Empiricism support the 'accretion' model of the history of science, for the continued existence of educated humanity means the continued accumulation of sensory experience and Empiricism holds the assertions describing these to be established beyond theoretical criticism (they are used to criticize theories, not vice versa). Theories amount sim ply to increasingly effective organizations of this accumulating data and to prediction machines for data to come. The foregoing remarks suggest (but do no more than this) the way in which the Empiricisms also find their place in a coherent world-view, (one has a semantics and epistemology, but also a psychology, which determine the basic outline, if not the detail, of a detailed model of man's evolution and functioning), one opposed in very important respects to that of Scientific Realism as I shall expound it. It is in this opposition that the real bite of the dispute begins to be felt. 3. The conventionalist alternative Conventionalism is the view that the theories of science are systems of conventions, without literal significance, whose use is justified by the way in which they organize the data of science. Since it constitutes the other major opposition to Realism I shall briefly outline the position.</page><page sequence="12">420 C. A. HOOKER Conventionalism then also introduces a fundamental theoretical/ob servational dichotomy; for this reason it has often drawn succour and support from much the same doctrines as back P-Empiricism. But the special impetus for the doctrine lies elsewhere for, unlike the Empiricisms, Conventionalism does not attempt to reduce away part or all of the theoretical hierarchy in terms of the observational level, it simply shifts the status of the entire hierarchy without being especially interested in altering its detail. The root source of the conventionalist urge, like that of the Empiri cisms, is the epistemological agnosticism to which Scientific Realism is heir (see Section 4). If theories can neither be verified nor conclusively refuted then are we not justified in regarding them only as convenient fictions, elaborate fa?ons de parler to organize data? And is not this the only justified view? Moreover this point of view apparently obtains some backing from experience in mathematics where one has mathematically consistent systems each claiming to satisfactorily realize subject matter (e.g. geometry) and which primarily differ only in some of the root defi nitions (e.g. that of straight line). This was, e.g. the route that led Poincar? to the position (see [137]). Recently pro-Conventionalist thought has been given some impetus by two consequences of a contemporarily fashionable Realism, that ex pounded by Feyerabend and others (e.g. Kuhn, Lakatos in many respects). For this view claims that the semantic content of the observation language stems from that of the theoretical language and not vice versa and that theory determines semantic content in such a way that conflicting theories are semantically 'incommensurable'. But this suggests that there is no area of science where a simple matching of human thought and nature is possible and that disputes between theories are not factual in the 'hard', straightforward way Realism seems to require. Theories then seem more like initially arbitrary creations of the human mind which float free of the world except insofar as we use them as conveniences to organize our lives. Whatever this support amounts to it is not compelling (otherwise we would have a reductio on this form of Realism), rather must it be combined with certain philosophical principles stating a preferred world view (in particular, a preferred epistemology) before it supports a shift away from Realism - but for those who hold such preferences the belief that this was the only acceptable form of Realism (a view I shall counter</page><page sequence="13">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 421 below), like the perception of the epistemic agnosticism of Realism, would constitute a strong motive to look for an alternative world view (it hardly follows that it must be the Conventionalist view). It is clear enough that Conventionalism fits yet another world view, one which would share some basic features with empiricist world views but in which there would be a rather different account of the significance of the evolution of the neurophysiological equipment of the human being, the significance of language use and thought as well as in epistemology and semantics. (E.g., presumably conventionalists would want to give an evolutionary account of speculative thought which makes it clear why the operative mechanisms made plausible the conventional status of the oretical talk; just as Empiricism, when it is not Idealist, must offer an account of the neurophysiological mechanisms backing the reduction of every concept to certain simple, impressed concepts.) It is, however, neither my responsibility nor my interest to elaborate that view here (and one does not readily find it done by conventionalists them selves). Instrumentalism, the view that theories have no truth value status at all but are merely convenient calculational recipes, I regard as a 'last ditch' version of Conventionalism (cf. Section 4.4.)n These are the doctrines which form the systematic background for attacks on Realism. 4. Epistemology (i): general considerations 4.1. The Central Argument The attack on the Realist comes in many forms but the underlying, basic theme is always epistemological, the basic attack is always the same: "But you cannot know - cannot know - which of your theories is true, or even which is near the truth, so what sense is there in saying that they are to be taken literally?" I unreservably concede the premise of this argument, that epistemolog ical concession follows from even a superficial characterization of the logical structure of science.12 The general sense of this objection is that it is not reasonable to adopt Realism in the face of this epistemological fact. The retort to be answered</page><page sequence="14">422 C A. HOOKER is "Why not? What is the argument that leads from epistemological un certainty to rejection of semantical theory?". 4.2. A Strong Form of the Argument The strongest case that could be made would be one that terminated the argument with the conclusion that Realism was semantically void or in coherent, i. e. literally made no sense. To achieve a valid argument we clearly require a premise that passes from epistemological status to se mantical status. The weakest appropriate premise would be one of the general sort: those propositions whose truth values one can be confident of not knowing for certain can also make no sense. I shall call this assump tion the Epistemological Dogma. Of course stronger assumptions will also suffice. One of the strongest is : those putative propositions whose truth conditions we cannot be certain of knowing (verifying) also make no sense. This I shall call the Security Dogma. Other positions fall be tween these extremes, the most common probably being: those putative propositions instances of whose truth conditions... etc. as for the Security Dogma - this I shall call the Verifiability Dogma. There is only one kind of general doctrine I know ofthat is even capable in principle of supporting any of these claims and that is Empiricism in some form. Empiricism then is a general presupposition of the plausibil ity of this general kind of attack on the Realist. Empiricism has, of course, been under increasingly severe attack for several decades. What emerges from a careful consideration ofthat criticism, however, is that empiricism, despite the heavy criticism (justified in my view), is at its best a compre hensive philosophical doctrine which can only be adequately answered by another equally systematic (comprehensive) doctrine (otherwise the arguments against Empiricism largely become question begging). Such must Realism be - for it is sure that Realists must reject the dogmas of Empiricism (except perhaps a weakened dogma 3) since they leave no possibility in the account of the world for a serious role for the specifically theoretical in its own right, at all.13 Whereas Realism and Empiricism seem at least to be able to come to grips over specific arguments, Conventionalism seems best represented as simply offering an alternative view of the world which one does not argue to from Realist epistemology but which one might find attractive if one</page><page sequence="15">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 423 did not relish some features of Realist epistemology. (Actually, Empiri cism could also be presented in this way.) What are we to say of it? The first thing to be said is that Conventionalism shares many features with Empiricism and to that extent is open to the same kinds of criticism. Thus the conventionalist is committed to some form of the observational/ theoretical dichotomy (since primary empirical content is confined to a class of privileged, observational terms - though there is perhaps a sec ondary empirical content expressed in the form "It is a fact that the conventions C allow an adequate construction of empirical knowledge") and to a corresponding psychology of perception and reflection (the latter with a conventionalist twist) to back the view. But this dichotomous ap proach has been severely criticized in its empiricist guise and the Realist will judge the criticism no less relevant here. Moreover, Conventionalism unsupported is, as Wisdom remarks, on somewhat shaky ground for the following reason: it is not at all obvious that a suitable set of conventions will be forthcoming that will secure just those sentences a given theory requires. E.g. that the empirical dif ferences between Newtonian and relativistic physics might be recaptured by suitable changes in geometric conventions concerning the notions of time, straight line etc. is, if it succeeds at all, a brilliant piece of theoretical insight and not at all a superficial linguistic manoeuvre. To render every scientific change as a change in conventions will undoubtedly require considerable stretching of the notion of a convention. In the long run the position must be forced to no more than this : to change conventions is just to change the meanings of terms. This position is distinguishable from Realism only if the meanings of terms are so chosen that the theo retical claims come out analytically true under the semantical conventions (they become true 'by convention'). The conventionalist is then faced with three problems : (i) how to make it plausible that fundamental assertions of actual theories are indeed analytically or conventionally true, (ii) how to give a plausible account of the derivation of empirical generalizations (at least of those which differ from theory to theory, i.e. the non-trivial derivations) from such theories, (iii) how to give a plausible account of theory change. The instrumentalist, as I view him, steps into this situation and offers to relieve the conventionalist of this burden by construing theories so as to be devoid of semantical content (there is a metatheoretical language of</page><page sequence="16">424 C. A. HOOKER inferences that has semantical content, but this is an entirely different issue).14 The instrumentalist then is the least committal of all - he also takes the intellectual life less seriously, even the triumphs of applied non euclidean geometry are written off as nought but a successful pragmatic switch in calculation technique. Even so, this extreme move can certainly be made in order to protect the position. For that matter I have no doubt that a consistent conven tionalist treatment of science could be offered, sufficiently hard-nosed to mold science to suit it rather than vice-versa. Conventionalism, like Em piricism, can be turned into a sufficiently elaborate world-view and has enough initially plausible contact with the world to be defensible by suffi ciently hard-nosed techniques. The Realist then can only pit against this his own systematic position. It behooves me therefore to present a Realist epistemology to replace that of Empiricism. 4.3. A Realist Epistemology Now, and I cannot stress this too heavily, whether or not a Realist gets into difficulty here depends largely upon the epistemology he chooses. If, e.g., he chooses to adopt the Doctrine of the Given (dogma 4), i.e. a foundational epistemology, then he will be hard put to it not to plausibly choose the given from the domain of the sensorially experienced; if we now add (i) that theoretical concepts are not instantiated as such in this domain and (ii) that the theoretical description and the initial observa tional description (the 'scientific image' and the 'manifest image') of the sensorially accessible situations are in general in conflict (both plausible claims) then we must conclude (twice over) that theories are relegated to a status where they can never function as literal descriptions. Dogma 4, therefore, had better not serve as part of any Realist epistemology. Before we go any further it will be well to state more exactly the con sequences of rejecting a foundational epistemology, for such a rejection may be, and usually is, associated with a more general philosophical po sition of a sort considerably more 'radical' than the rejection actually requires. Precisely, I want to point out that the rejection of a foundational epistemology does not entail (1) that one cannot draw a legitimate ob servational/theoretical dichotomy, and does not entail (2) that there are no epistemological asymmetries among the claims of science, so that these</page><page sequence="17">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 425 claims can be ordered in respect of epistemological primacy or accepta bility (in particular along some axis which might correspond to an ob servational-theoretical hierarchy), and does not entail (3) that semantic content is purely non-ostensive and that the notion of ostensive definition must be given up. (The lee-way opened up here is important for a dis cussion of Realist alternatives.) Now we are ready to proceed. There seems to be just one epistemology for the Realist and that doctrine is dictated by experience, namely a naturalistic, foundationless epistemology of ignorance. By this latter I mean (1) that epistemological theory is strongly determined by our scientific view of the world and our place in it,15 (2) that with respect to justified belief man commences from total ignorance and approaches the truth only through imaginative guess-work and trial and error, and (3) there is no class of beliefs having the privileged status of unrevisable truths (in the historical process of critical inquiry all beliefs may be subject to revision, however 'fundamental'), there is therefore no class of accepted truths that could serve as the foundation of empirical knowledge. The Realist is pledged to take his science seriously, in particular, there fore, the sciences of Biology, Anthropology, Psychology and the History of Science itself. The former two sciences inform us of the evolution of man from more restricted origins, the initial ignorance is well attested - even information built into neurological structure through evolution in the form of dispositions etc. can be called in question when it appears at the conceptual level and anyway could not merit a role as foundation for knowledge on those grounds. (Though there is an important role for such pre-experiencial structuring - cf. my [66].) Psychological research in creasingly undermines the relevance, hence plausibility, of the pheno menalistic approach to perception. In its place I insert my own Realist view of perception, designed to harmonise with the scientific findings; for clearly if the phenomenalist analysis of knowledge is accurate there is no place for Scientific Realism - Realism in science includes psychology, hence the theory of perception, and so requires a Realist philosophical doctrine of perception also.16 My Realist doctrine is unsympathetic to any 'Doctrine of the Given', i.e. to a traditional foundational epistemology. (For the detailed argument see my [58].) The history of science supports the view that even the most fundamental assumptions (even the laws of logic, let alone the fundamental ontology types, the nature of space and</page><page sequence="18">426 C. A. HOOKER time etc.) may be opened to challenging revisions.17 Hence the doctrine. So, man is born in ignorance and has only his pitiful senses and his imagination as aids to truth. No theory can be known or be guaranteed to be true - neither by observation nor by other means; the history of science teaches us the overwhelming likelihood that today's theory will not be tomorrow's. Theories are only intended true descriptions. More over they are intended truths for which we must admit that there are infinitely many incompatible alternatives, we must even admit that there are infinitely many experimentally indistinguishable incompatible alter natives. And the Scientific Realist must admit that the reality which he claims science intends to accurately describe is known only through these attempts at theoretical description; there is no independent access. Thus one must face each theory with a degree of critical or sceptical distrust - a generalized agnosticism is the order of the day. Let us face this bogey right here. According to the Realist, every time one does serious science one sticks one's philosophical and scientific neck out, one runs the risk of being wrong (without, I think, knowing what the odds of error are). It is no use pointing to that conclusion ex pecting the Realist to capitulate in horror and stomach ulcers once it is clear how wide the scope of his agnosticism must be. (Without reasonable doubt, every decent extant scientific theory is false and pretty obviously so.) For the Realist revels in this situation! Remember Popper's dictum: the more risks you run, the more interesting and imaginative your theory is, the more you stand to learn through its failure. On the other hand, in the face of these uncertainties many philosophers turned away to look for more comfortable truths. Various shades of Empiricism, of Instrumentalism, of Phenomenalism offer to take the un certainty out of epistemic life by reducing theories to harmless parasitic non-entities of convenience, or by reducing them away altogether. (How ever clad in impressive theories of concept formation etc., this is the truest function of the foregoing positions.) Scientific Realists, however, gladly accept these uncertainties and their consequences - for they have a real istic picture of man, they know the poverty of his ignorance, the slight riches of imagination and the limited reach of science. By comparison, the alternatives succeed, ironically, only in stripping man down to a meagre stature - too meagre even to provide a plausible account of his activities. This much we have already seen in the brief comparison of</page><page sequence="19">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 427 empiricist dogmas with the scientific view of man. And we shall see it reinforced when we compare the empiricist structure of science itself with a more realistic version. According to this Realist analysis the epistemological dogma is too restrictive twice over. In the first place there is the assumption that it is of the essence of informative, communicable content that it be possible to be certain of knowing it; this the Realist denies citing as the outstanding counter example precisely the contents of scientific theories.18 In addi tion, there is a tacit assumption that knowledge essentially demands cer tainty and this the Realist also denies, for it represents an impossibly high goal. (On this criterion, even the logical form of the world would be ex cluded from knowledge.) We may insist on this criterion of knowledge if we wish, but we shall then simply call forth a new word to refer to all those things of importance to us which are not 'known'. What the Realist may assent to (this Realist would anyway) is that knowledge does demand simple truth, and then claims to knowledge can still only be tentatively accepted. For Realism, knowledge does not turn out to be a very im portant category - and sure or certain knowledge a completely insignif icant category - the interesting category is tentative knowledge and con jecture. This result may seem ironic, even paradoxical, to many philos ophers who would regard Realists as over-bold about their claims for man's abilities (e.g. the ability to transcend sensory experience), but actually it expresses a natural agnostic modesty which flows precisely from taking man's ability to theorize seriously. A little earlier I pointed out that the real power of P-Empiricism stems from the fact that its reductionist principles collapse truth conditions into knowledge conditions, so that no epistemological agnosticism was necessary. The Realist rejects such semantics. Here we set down the first two semantical distinctions of Realism : (Dx) The truth conditions of a proposition are distinct from the con ditions for its having a coherent semantic content (i.e. for its meaningfulness). (D2) The conditions under which a proposition is true (respectively, false) are distinct from the conditions under which it is known to be true (respectively, false). These distinctions are theoretical distinctions; of course a single set of cir cumstances may in fact yield even all three sets of conditions (e.g. the</page><page sequence="20">428 C. A. HOOKER circumstances of our world) but even here it is a rare thing for the minimal sufficient conditions of each sort to have any significant overlap, let alone coincide.19 Now the Realist is faced with a task: specify the semantics of scientific theories. I shall return to this task later in the essay. 4.4. A Weaker Form of the Argument It is time now to return to the original argument and, having rejected the stronger versions of it (where the valid conclusion was literal senselessness of Realism), consider a weaker, but more plausible version. Now the argument runs: since no theory can admittedly be known to be true, since in fact all those that we have are almost certainly false, and since we change theories continually, is it not prudent... wise... reasonable! that we take a more conservative line than Realism over their significance? (And this is just what Conventionalism-Instrumentalism does - it identi fies the semantical nature of theories with one of their useful non-epistemic functions, as convenient calculation devices.) The Realist ought to be quite candid about this point: there is nothing in the realm of the 'hard data' of individual theories that could possibly distinguish his position from the Instrumentalist alternative with respect to those theories. From this highly restricted point of view the most that can be done is to point to the central role which theoretical structure plays in guiding research, modifying and changing scientific beliefs, form ing hard data from phenomenal data etc. The hard-nosed opponent, how ever, can simply treat this as heuristics. But we can enlarge the battlefield. The point of Realism is to support a naturalistic world view. In this world view objects, geometry, man, the universe at large, are taken seriously as science knows them - and science knows them basically in terms of its theories. The instrumentalist on the other hand must restrict himself to organizing observable data, he can't take this view of the world seriously, the only things he can take seriously are the little partial glimpses of it that come to man through his senses. The final protest that the Realist makes then is to point out the implausi bility of the resulting anthropomorphism that takes only things at a man sized level seriously, the likely unhealthiness behind the insistence on epistemological security, the in-built tendency towards solipsist pheno menalism and so on. But exactly the point of being hard-nosed is the</page><page sequence="21">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 429 willingness (I am tempted to say, the ability) to ignore these charges. And so at last we run up against differences of philosophical temperament. The conservative, the Instrumentalist, is willing to write off these reasons for taking theories seriously as literal descriptions as mere appearance against the gain (for him) of taking no epistemological risks with theories - which are so manifestly risky - while still giving their skeletons some thing to do in science. The Realist on the other hand finds that the risks only add interest to a view already satisfying because of the way it comes fairly to grips with the unfolding intellectual drama of the human race. He would like an argument, some specific feature of science that could be adduced as a reason for not taking a straightforward view. There are only two additional arguments I can think of. The first runs as follows. The simple schematic Empiricist model of science (Note 12) places no restrictions on what can go into the topmost layers, but without restriction it would be possible to trivially explain anything. In fact sci ence employs a host of selection principles which operate at this level to severely restrict the kind of theory admissible - the most important of these are simplicity in all its forms (often incompatible forms20), retention (in a generalized way - e.g. as a limiting approximation) of as much of the preceding theories in a field as is possible, preferred kinds of development to suit preferred ontologies (e.g. to suit atoms + void, or field, ontologies). But these principles clearly have no independent justification in nature, they are empirically arbitrary (though they are not pragmatically arbi trary) restrictions brought down to make the job of theory construction manageable. But if theories in science are to be governed by such obviously anthropomorphic rules how can they, should they, be taken seriously as literal descriptions? To this there is no reply but 'Why should they not be?' It is true that restricting our theory construction in these ways is reason for greater scepticism about our theories, but why should it be anything more? More over, we still stand a chance of discovering whatever there is to discover in the world at the level of the simple mathematical forms with which we operate. One might as well argue : The only empirical information avail able to us comes via our pitifully limited senses and the instruments we can construct which are restricted by our pitifully limited resources and information; hence it is useless to take such anthropomorphically ground ed theories seriously. Our information is indeed severely limited but if</page><page sequence="22">430 C. A. HOOKER anything is necessary in a guide to the truth, our sensory and instrumental experience is. Thus this well-known move against Realism also fails. We have instead another Realist distinction : (D3) What is useful in a particular respect in science is distinct from what is meaningful in science. Moreover, the premise of the preceding argument is not obviously true. I am of the firm opinion that it is possible to be critical of one's preferred metaphysics in science, as critical of it as we can be of anything in sci ence. 21 Though the story is complex, the elements will be sketched a little later.22 Of course this means that, consistently with the Realist episte mology enunciated, there is ultimately no preferred metaphysics (just as, in this sense, there is ultimately no preferred logic, or preferred anything else of this sort). Moreover since I hold the mathematical structures of science to embody a metaphysics, the continual preservation and develop ment of a mathematical formalism is as critically justified as is the ex ploration of the potentialities of a metaphysics. Finally, there are con siderations of the sort Popper offers23 to believe that there is some justifi cation for choosing to explore the simplest theories first (though this defense is easily in the worst shape of all).24 There is of course another, well-known argument for not taking the straightforward view. It is based on the ability to deal exclusively with the purely observational part of a theory (with levels 3 and 4 only). The method of capturing just the observational part of a theory is due to Craig. The argument then runs : Either the theoretical terms of a theory serve their purpose in leading to the establishment of a network of con nections among observable terms and then they are unnecessary for the empirical purposes of science, or they fail to serve this purpose in which case they are to be rejected as useless; in either case theoretical terms serve no useful purpose in science (Hempel [51], pp. 49-50). But this possibility poses no threat to the Realist, from the fact that such a separation of theory and observation is possible nothing follows about the semantical status of the terms of the separated components (whether theoretical or observable) - one could obtain a conclusion of the sort opponents of Realism wish only if an additional premise was added to the effect that what is not necessary to the sense-confirmable portion of science has no semantic content, but this premise simply recapitulates the empiricist</page><page sequence="23">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 431 positivist dogmas and will be rejected by the Realist, precisely because of the anthropomorphic, implausible world view to which they lead (cf. p. 428 above). It is important to understand this point: this attempt is not rejected because it has a defect (that would constitute additional reason) but because of the general world view necessary to give it force.25 These arguments both fail and they are the only arguments I know of. I conclude that there is nothing but philosophical temperament left with which to decide the issue - except a reasonable assessment of the pluses and minuses of each side, and for a realistic view of the world I'll back Realism. (The aim - the fundamental aim - of science is discovery and understanding, I think, not pragmatic convenience of control, nor power, nor security.) 4.5 A Second Objection The next objection hinges precisely on the tendency for theories to change radically. If they do so then the presumed fundamental ontology of the world may change, not just particular putative entities may now be denied existence, but entire putative categories of entities, indeed all putative categories of things, may now be denied existence. (This latter would happen if, e.g., physics in general switched between a field-plenum and particle fundamental ontology.) Moreover, so the objection goes, the semantical contents of such disparate theories will also be radically dif ferent - even where many of the same phoneme groups are employed. Moreover, it may well be the case that theories of these disparate types are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. But if this is the case how can any theories be taken as literal descriptions when the kinds of world the various possible theories describe differ so radically from one another? Or again, doesn't the radical semantical shifts that can occur show that theories are only implausibly viewed as intended descrip tions of a single real world and more plausibly regarded as heuristic linguistic devices? The short reply to both questions is: Why? Where is the valid argu ment that leads from the premises to the conclusion(s)? There is nothing very strange, given our Realist epistemology, with changing our minds radically about the nature of the world; and what semantical shifts there are follow on from that change of mind, as we attempt to express it. To make the reply more honey-reasonable, and a little longer, the Realist</page><page sequence="24">432 C. A. HOOKER can point out that one can have many kinds of mutually radically disparate maps of the one stretch of land - and language is like a complex map. (It is the mapping view of descriptive language which explains why even at our simplistic level of concept formation and mathematical skill we might still expect to discover some truths concerning the world.) 5. Epistemology (ii): the structure of science Our considerations concerning the structure of science begin with yet another objection. The first premise of the objection is that many, indeed all, of the mathematically sophisticated mathematical theories of science deal only in mathematical idealization (point masses, instantaneous rates of change etc.). The second premise is that no such idealization is ever realized in nature and the conclusion is that no Realist interpretation of these theories succeeds. A weaker, but still sufficient claim would be that not all such idealizations to which the theory was prima facie committed can be realized in nature, and the conclusion retained in its present form.26 Certainly the Realist concedes at least the weaker second premise and corresponding conclusion - with the important proviso that the word 'naive' qualify 'Realist' in the conclusion. But this is an objection of the sort the Realist cherishes for it permits a complete turning of the tables on the objector. Let us begin by noticing that the empiricist is equally at a loss to cope with this feature of science. Since we never observe such idealizations in nature they must be theoretical entities, but then the theories in question are patently 'about' such entities, rather than about the observable world which is their only legitimate subject matter according to Empiricism. The simple empiricist structure outlined in Note 12 simply cannot accom modate such entities, they remain anomalous.27 (On this score, only the conventionalist has a superficially plausible account.) But it is when we begin searching for a Realist reply to this objection, which takes the form of a more adequate Realist reconstruction of the structure of science, that we see that both Empiricism and Conventionalism are bound to offer an inadequate view of science and to ignore the profound complexities re vealed therein. Elsewhere I have offered a preliminary investigation of what I termed the 'global theories' of science (cf. [71]). These are theories that are inter</page><page sequence="25">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 433 nally and externally global. By an internally global theory I mean a theory that not only offers a fundamental model of the world, but also determines, at least in part, what in real systems is observable, what instrumental means can be used to observe and how reliably, how strongly various data support or undermine its assertions, even in what language the data are to be described, and so on. By an externally global theory I mean one that requires a battery of additional theories for its successful applica tion. I argued that most of the theories of quantitative science were global theories in both these senses.28 Empiricism, precisely because it treats theories in isolation from one another, and because of its necessarily simplistic epistemology for science, cannot accommodate these basic characteristics of scientific theories. (A striking example of this is found in the fact that P-Empiricism and Em piricism, precisely because they reduce all theoretical assertions to logical combinations of indubitable sensory reports, cannot erect a truly critical theory of perception and hence cannot give a realistic account of psycho logy, for it is the business of a global psychological theory both to explain how man behaves and how he comes to know what he does about what he does.) For the structural schema for science which I suggested as a replacement for the empiricist scheme see Figure 1. This schema has at least seven respects in which it differs from, and improves upon, the em piricist schema.29 (1) The external global characteristics are explicitly recognized in the structure. The schema recognizes explicitly that two sets of additional theories are in general an essential part of any scientific situation. Such theories appear at 2 levels: (id) there may be additional theories needed in order to apply a given theory to a certain kind of situation (e.g. classical and quantum mechanics of individual interactions must be supplemented by classical and quantum statistical theory respectively before they are adequate to handle practical applications to gases, liquids and solids); (ib) having obtained the right general kind of theory, additional theories still will often be needed in order to work out a theory of the specific kind of experimental situation envisaged (e.g. to the quantum theory of pair for mation must be added the quantum theory of gaseous ionization and elec tromagnetic theory in order to get a theory of the behaviour of such fun damental particle pairs in the general experimental environment of a gas immersed in an electromagnetic field); (ic) finally, in order to know how</page><page sequence="26">434 C. A. HOOKER to process instrumental outputs the theories of these instruments must be set down and related to the various features of the theoretical situations which may arise. These theories therefore have direct inputs into which instruments are chosen (sometimes indeed even an influence on which system (type) is chosen for investigation) and how the data is prepared and processed (including, in particular, the estimates of its reliability). In addition the structure includes the general 'background' theories - the various theories of mathematics and psychology, and whatever else may need to be assumed to obtain the ceteris paribus clause always invoked.30 (2) The internal global characteristics are explicitly recognized in the influence that the theory nominally under test (T0) has on these same features of the situation, the selection of system and instruments the pre paration and processing of data. (I say 'nominally' under test because there is no severe asymmetry of roles between T0 and the other theories in these respects.) (3) The structure explicitly recognizes the important role of mathe matical models in global theories. The mathematical theories of science that I have been discussing all model the real world using various mathe matical models (e.g. differential geometry, point masses, instantaneous velocities etc.) and often these are known to be idealizations (e.g. point masses). From a formal point of view the theory is directly about the behaviour of these model systems, not the real world systems. Indirectly, though, these models are seen as models of the real world systems, ade quate in the relevant respects in certain circumstances, within a given tolerance. In most cases the transformation from the actual crudely ob servable properties of actual systems to the corresponding properties of the model is a very complex one, requiring various 'corrections' and 'ad justments' to the crudely described system until the model system prop erties are approached.31 And the further transformation from the real system behaviour now described in the technical terms of the model to that of the model behaviour may be just as complex, since real systems, however described, do not behave exactly as idealized models.32 The dis tinction between these two kinds of transition is important in establishing the character of two distinct kinds of correspondence rules - cf. (5) below. I emphasize that it is not description in common sense terms alone that requires the complex transition to theory discussed above. Even de scriptions couched in such technical terms as 'Wilson cloud chamber'</page><page sequence="27">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 435 'ionizing particle trajectory', 'flip-flop pulse out-put' and so on still require the same kinds of transformations before the relevant theory of these systems can be brought to bear. It is only when data are presented at the level of, and in the form of the theoretical model that we can obtain an experimental verdict on the theory (or, if you prefer, it is only when the theoretical model can be linked to the simplest level of observational description via the theory of the ex perimental situation, that the theory can be confronted by experiment). Thus the appearance of the 'model-system filter-transformer' in the schematic diagram. All connections between theory and experiment pass through this filter-transformer which has the task of commencing with an identification of the objects in the experimental situation (system under test plus instruments) - whether in common sense or technical terms makes no essential difference when the goal is hard data (it only adds or sub tracts a step or two) - and tailoring their behaviour to fit the best the oretical models of them. Clearly it is this complex procedure which deter mines just how we prepare and process the data (as well as having the prior function of influencing the choice of system and instruments). As Sellars remarks, the empiricist reconstruction of science, however, sees no essential function for models at all (see [117], p. 178). With models taken seriously the deductive theory of explanation (cf. Hempel [51]) receives a necessary enrichment. The point of explaining the behaviour of a system S is not just the deduction of true descriptions of aS's behaviour from the theory - this almost never happens exactly and it is far too crude a characterization of the actual situation. A theory ex plains 5"s behaviour by providing an appropriate model for S such that good approximations to S"s behaviour are deducible from that model description in conjunction with the theory and via the filter-transformer. One then says, provided the model is of the right sort (i.e. not based on a mere formal analogy etc.) that one has captured what S really is, in essentials. It is this provision of insight into the real nature of S that we normally count on in satisfying explanations.33 Models play a similarly important role in inter-theoretical explanation. What allows a number of distinct theories to be brought to bear on the same problem is the fact that they share aspects (or fragments) of a single model in common. Moreover, one does not in general deduce the em pirical generalizations of a succeeded theory from its successor, this is</page><page sequence="28">436 C. A. HOOKER generally impossible because the two conflict, but the successor theory, by providing a model in its own terms of the world as modelled in the suc ceeded theory, explains why the succeeded theory should have been as experimentally successful as it was. (4) There is a little observed feature of the scientific reasoning process, namely that often not even the derivation of observable results is deductively valid. Traditional Empiricism assumes a fully deductive structure. The situation as envisaged here, however, is to explicitly allow the theory/data transitions appearing therein to include non-deductively valid arguments as well as deductive arguments.34 (5) The nature and role of the so-called correspondence rules is radical ly different and much more complex than that envisaged in the empiricist model. Here there are two distinctively different kinds of linkages between theory and the world. The first of these are linkages between theory and hard data. There are the connections usually considered by working scientists. In this case the linkages are extremely complex, since they must properly be traced down through the filter-transformer and back up through the data pro cessing and preparation chains. Notice, though, that the end result of this chain can be expressed as a direct theory-hard data linkage. (E.g. for quantum theory we might have, very roughly: "An electron-ionized track intersecting a positron-ionized track in a Wilson cloud chamber gives off a particle producing no ionization until... etc.".) The temptation to resort to this expression alone is fatal, however, because it suppresses all of the complex and novel features of these linkages. (/) It tends to suppress the distinction between hard data and phenomenal data (cf. below), (ii) It suppresses the role of models in developing the correspondences. (Hi) Even more importantly it suppresses their character as multiply theory dependent. (I daresay there is not a single correspondence rule connecting any real life global theory to hard data which is not thus dependent upon other theories as well.) But there is also a second kind of linkage included, that between model and the phenomenal data and identification level. These are the linkages that connect model theoretic assertions to commonsense descriptions.35 (Thus: "A Wilson cloud chamber (technical model theoretic name) is a vacuum sealed box capable of providing super-saturated vapour by...", and even further than this quasitechnical description: "A Wilson cloud</page><page sequence="29">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 437 chamber (same use) is a black metal box with a little plunger that...", and perhaps we are still not sufficiently 'far down' into commonsense terminology. At all events we are dealing with a continuum of cases here whose bottom is 'pure ordinary English', whatever that is - cf. below.) The scientist habitually makes use of such connections to tell his tech nicians, or the storeman, what to do, but they never enter his account of science. They are, on the other hand, what the epistemologically self conscious philosopher typically has in mind, though they are often con fused with the former rules. Finally note that both types of linkage may contain inductive as well as deductive components, again a departure from the traditional model. (6) The present schema explicitly recognizes the presence and impor tance of a 'supra-theoretic' level of proto-theories and beyond those again a further level of metaphysics. These elements, which are almost without exception only tacit in the exposition of theories, are also almost univer sally ignored by philosophers. Positivist-empiricists were an exception, they actually dismissed the crucially important metaphysical level! It is hard to over-emphasize the importance of this level. Suffice it to say that I believe that the entire history of physics can, in effect, be seen as the competition of two incompatible metaphysical schemes - the atoms + + void and the plena + no void schemes. And I have recently argued in some detail the thesis that the deep mathematical structures employed by theories of mathematical physics is chosen so as to reflect the preferred metaphysics that the theory is expressing (and further that this approach offers the only hope of unraveling the mystery of quantum theory).36 The metaphysical schemes lay down the most fundamental general prin ciples governing the conceptual structure of a coherent description of that kind of world - it is no wonder therefore that they have an all pervasive influence on the form and content of the theories that express them. Roughly speaking, they can be formulated as meta-theoretical assertions which place constraints on the admissable predicates and syn tactical forms for theory. (Toulmin's ideals of natural order are a part of this meta-theoretical machinery - cf. [131]). It is really much more en lightening to recognize a theory as having a meta-theoretical dimension (to put it paradoxically) and it has been a great loss to philosophy of science to ignore this dimension for so long. Also of considerable importance are the 'proto' theories (Bunge's term,</page><page sequence="30">438 C. A. HOOKER who first drew my attention to them - see [15]). These are the theories that express the assumed general structures of some of the quantities entering the formulation of scientific theories, and of some of the methods employed in their application. Thus we include here a theory of the struc ture of the time continuum (a set, ordered by an anti-symmetrical, transi tive, reflexive relation etc.), space, abstract measurement theory etc. (The reader should consult Bunge for details - but beware of reading too much into these proto-theories, cf. my [71].) Such theories could be assumed to be absorbed into the expression of each specific theory (as I suppose we ought charitably to assume the empiricists to do), but it certainly is not so in typical expressions of a theory and their special role has been largely overlooked. Of course they serve as an initial filling out of a metaphysics, hence their position in the schema. (7) Finally I draw attention again to the role accorded a 'phenomenal' or common sense level in the structure of science. We have already seen how that role might be criticized, indeed how in principle it might be eliminated, and how it is in any case not the chief linkage which appears in scientific accounts. In both of these ways it differs radically from the Empiricist analysis. A little later on I shall briefly describe may own cur rent views on its ultimate fate.37 Returning now to the objection with which this section began, namely why it is that the idealizations occurring in a theory do not render Realism untenable, we see now how a realistic analysis of science copes with the problem. Those espousing this argument emphasize that a theory's sen tences do not in general accurately match the phenomenal system be haviour (a few low-level generalizations aside) and of course this is some times accurate. But to conclude from thence (as e.g. Suppe [126] does) that the theory is false of the world is to move too fast. First we need to separate out those cases of conflict between theoretical and phenomenal level, if any, which are to be resolved on the side of theory. Such conflicts can arise in situations where there is a fundamental conflict between the conceptual structure of the theory and that of the phenomenal level (analogy: statistical mechanics vs 'phenomenological' thermodynamics). In these cases it is probably the phenomenal concepts which must be given up as conceptualizing mere appearance (unless the theory has noth ing else going for it), to do otherwise would be to offer too much respect to concepts at the phenomenal level. In most cases of straightforward</page><page sequence="31">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 439 conflict, I venture to suggest, there is no direct conflict between phenome nal and theoretical concepts (cf. below), it is just that some beliefs for mulated at the phenomenal level must be rejected.38 In all these cases the Realist position is unscathed, the theoretical terms offer the fundamental description of the world and it is the phenomenal level which must be corrected to meet it. That leaves us with only those cases in which there are theoretical reasons for believing that the theoretical idealizations cannot be realized at any level. In this last case there are again two subcases - that where there are grounds for believing that a particular idealization logically could not apply at any level and the remainder where we have grounds for believing that as a matter of fact it does not apply to our world (e.g. respectively lines of force, frictionless surfaces). In the latter case we can say that a theoretical claim is counterfactually true of the world, i.e. it says how the world would really behave if the appropriate conditions were realized. Contrary to those espousing the anti-Realist argument (e.g Suppe [126]) this circumstance is precisely compatible with Realism, it is in fact to say how the world really is in certain essential respects (and that these respects are merely complicated by additional conditions). If we wish to show this explicitly we may reformulate all relevant sentences of the theory so that they take the general form 'As the circumstances C approach Cl (the ideal circumstances) the behaviour of the system approaches B? (the theoretically specified behaviour)', where we assume the limiting process to be quantitatively specified. This leaves us with only the logically in applicable idealizations. These are fewer in number than people suppose.39 A Realist must insist on rigorously eliminating them from theory. I know of no case where this cannot be relatively simply done. And there are the strongest logical reasons for doing so (namely, there are logical grounds for asserting their ontic inapplicability). In short they can be seen to be pa tently devices of heuristic or convenience that can be done without. Thus, with one or two insubstantial modifications (clarifications) of theory, Real ism emerges from the argument not only unscathed but strengthened.40 6. Semantical considerations 6.1. The Theory of Truth The Realist is clearly committed to a Correspondence Theory of truth.</page><page sequence="32">440 C. A. HOOKER Whether this in itself brings with it any special semantics is not easy to say. Certainly Tarski's semantic theory of truth will be adopted; but, contrary to Tarski's own view, I do not believe that this is an explication of a peculiarly correspondence theory of truth, the coherence theorist might - and I believe ought - equally well take it over, for it forms a general account of part of the semantical structure of any language rather than an acccount of a specific theory of truth. While the correspondence theory is clearly connected with Realism, the coherence theory is con nected with Conventionalism and Instrumentalism where the ordering of data is emphasized. 6.2. An Objection to the Theory of Truth These remarks carry me to a correlative objective. Look about you, this objection runs, when does the scientific community count an assertion as true? Just when it coheres with all of the data available and with the best theory available. And what is the strongest operative criterion in the preferring of one theoretical description to another? Why, aside from compatibility with the data, the inner coherence and comprehensiveness of the theory. Surely then if any criterion of truth is relevant to science it is the coherence criterion, so that one ought to adopt this view of truth rather than the correspondence view. In any case the foregoing episte mological considerations have shown that for a Realist the correspon dence theory would be effectively inoperative - it has already been con ceded that we cannot choose our theories on the basis of their correspon dence with the world, but precisely on the coherence criteria outlined above. Once you leave all claims open to revision the only criteria re maining are coherence criteria. Once again the Realist must candidly admit that such coherence criteria dominate in science, and for just the reasons given in the objection. But these criteria are criteria of acceptance, not of truth. The foregoing ob jection simply confuses acceptance and truth and in so doing collapses. For the Realist to accept a claim or theory is a pragmatic decision to act, for the time being, as if the claim or theory were true; for the claim or theory to be true is a non-pragmatic semantical state of affairs in which the theory in some sense accurately mirrors the world. Thus we have the fourth distinction important to Realism:</page><page sequence="33">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 441 (D4) The conditions for accepting a scientific claim or theory are dis tinct from the conditions for the truth of that claim or theory. Again (D4) states a conceptual distinction; most of the time the two sets of conditions will in fact also be distinct but various degrees of overlap may occur. 6.3. Realist Semantics (I): The Issues But now the central semantical challenges to the Realist are unavoidable : (1) Say in what the meanings of theoretical terms consist, i.e. explain the basis of the semantical contents of theories; (2) Show how it is possible for theories to mirror the world, i.e. show how this semantical role for theories is possible. 6.4. Realist Semantics (II): From Whence Meanings? With respect to the first challenge I must admit that I have no satisfying theory to offer. Indeed, this seems to me to be one of the outstanding trouble-spots for Realism. But since, as it also seems to me, no-one else has anything more satisfying to say than what I shall say here, this is an outstanding problem for the Realist, but not a, peculiar embarrassment for him. As a Realist it seems to me at this point in time that I have available a spectrum of choices for a doctrine of semantical content, from a radical position, say Feyerabend's or Quine's, through more conservative doc trines (e.g. Sellars) to a conservative doctrine quite close to the empiricist tradition (Maxwell). I shall briefly elaborate these doctrines and then state my own view of the most plausible position in the spectrum. 6.4.1. Quasi-Empiricist Realism I shall begin at the conservative end, for that seems to be the least likely defensible Realist position. Essentially, Maxwell takes a Ramsey treat ment of theoretical terms41 seriously. Roughly speaking, theoretical terms are treated as if they were bound variables, thus a sentence of the (sim plest) form (x) Tx, is 'transcribed' to (3r) (x) tx,</page><page sequence="34">442 C. A. HOOKER and so on for more complex sentences. As a matter of fact, though not of necessity, this treatment is not extended to the observable terms of a theory and so this approach presupposes, and enhances, an observational/ theoretical dichotomy. It is clear that this approach has the intention of treating the observa tional and theoretical levels quite differently; roughly the intention is to grant observational terms a 'full status', they are to have connotations (a sense, intensional content or what-have-you) as well as denotations (ex tensions), whereas theoretical terms are merely predicates, we know-not of-what-content, which stand in certain extensional relations to each other and to the observational terms.42 Maxwell regards the observational terms as essentially achieving their connotations through ostensive defi nition (he speaks in terms of Russell's knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description). Moreover, in this exposition of a theory, the observational level has epistemological priority for purposes of accep tance or rejection of the theory. Thus this view builds in much of the character of the empiricist view of theories - the issue is whether it builds in too much to be acceptable to the Realist. First let us be clear that a number of immediate criticisms of this ap proach do not succeed : (i) deductive systematization is preserved and (ii) it can even be plausibly maintained that inductive systematization can be preserved43 (in any case this latter objection is not decisive against some one who abandoned induction altogether in favour of the hypothetico deductive approach - again the Realist, qua Realist, may be non-committal on this latter choice); (iii) that alternative models satisfy the Ramsey for malism is irrelevant; (iv) a Maxwell Ramseyan is not committed to the doctrine of the given (to dogma 4 of Empiricism), for nowhere is it as serted that the observational level claims are not open to revision and nothing has been said about concept-percept formation; (v) finally note that this position is not committed to the analytic-synthetic dogma, for a sharp observational/theoretical dichotomy is neither a necessary, nor sufficient, condition for this dogma (the one is semantical, the other epistemological), so that the way is still open here to regard logic as em pirical if one desires (and this Realist desires to). In fact, Maxwell claims that the Ramsey approach does not eliminate theoretical roles, for they have extensional roles not reproducible from the resources of the observational level. If ontology then is, roughly, what</page><page sequence="35">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 443 we must quantify over to have our assertions come out true, then the intended ontology of theories includes theoretical entities. Actually, I be lieve he is strictly able to assert only that very probably the Ramsey ap proach does not eliminate theoretical entities, for it is just possible that the objects satisfying the existential claims are non-theoretical objects, though this is so unlikely to be true that Maxwell's position is worth pursuing.44 Moreover, this approach can consistently be conjoined with a Realist doctrine of perception and with the denial of the given to recapture the essence of the Realist epistemology adumbrated earlier. That observa tional terms are, de facto, semantically and epistemologically privileged counts nothing against Realism so long as observational claims are equally open to criticism in the light of experience and theoretical ad vance. (That the 'nothing' here is strictly warranted is controversial, cf. my treatment of Sellars' argument below.) Indeed, Maxwell has a persuasive argument for his position. The ar gument runs as follows : (i) Beyond some level of some reasonably direct observational acquaintance we could really only know about the nature of the physical world through its causal consequences for those features of the world which are included in the directly observable level, and (ii) that the only such deeper-lying features which appear on this 'observable surface' are the structural relations and causal relations among the un observable entities (simply because such structural and causal relations can be mediated through causal or nomic connections whereas the in trinsic properties themselves cannot be mediated in this fashion); it follows, therefore, that theoretical terms can significantly only stand for such relations and hence that they will be essentially structural in form and without qualitative content semantically.45 And there is a correlative argument for the observational/theoretical dichotomy which runs: Scientific theories are developed to explain and predict events in our observable world ; however, because of the poverty of our senses such theories typically must employ unobservable entities, i.e. theoretical entities, in providing powerful explanatory and predictive systems; accordingly, the observational/theoretical dichotomy is an in tegral part of the scientific endeavour and arises quite naturally out of our sensory limitations. The premises of these arguments seems to me to be entirely plausible and the arguments are surely valid. Together they constitute a powerful</page><page sequence="36">444 C. A. HOOKER prima facie case for this quasi-empiricist position (indeed, for the em piricist position itself). I turn now to an important argument of Sellars (see especially [116] and [117]). Sellars argues that terms have 'first class semantical status' only when they belong, or could belong, to the picturing language, i.e. only when, in some sense, they literally mirror or picture the world; but they can only have this semantical role if they occur, or could occur, in the observational vocabulary. Therefore, any analysis of science, e.g. Em piricism, which relegates theoretical terms to an in principle non-observa tional role necessarily prevents them from being taken Realistically. It looks as if this argument will apply equally against Maxwell's position. Leaving aside the first premise, which is not strictly necessary (though I am inclined to accept Sellars' semantical account of what is peculiar to the correspondence doctrine of truth anyway), the Realist ought to grant the other premise, and the validity, of the argument. Indeed the recognition that, to be taken seriously (Realistically), the theoretical terms must, in principle, be capable of playing an observational role is one of the greatest of the post-Positivist lessons learned, primarily through the efforts of a mild epistemological conservative (Sellars) and an episte mological radical (Feyerabend). Roughly the idea is that, from a God's eye perspective, the world must be exactly as (true) fundamental theory says it is and so one can in principle conceive of a sentient with sufficiently rich sensory equipment to observe all of these characteristics. (Notice though that this doctrine does not require commitment to any empiricist belief that observational terms have a special semantical content, it is entirely independent of that doctrine.) But the further conclusion that the argument applies equally against Maxwell's position as against Empiricism is too hasty, on two grounds. (1) The argument is valid if, but only if, the 'in principle' is construed as 'logically possible'. In particular, the argument does not support the con clusion that it must be physically possible for theoretical terms to play an observational role, let alone that this role be actually realized. After all, whether or not this latter occurs depends, at least in important part, on the actual physical structure of our sensory relations with the world and on the structure of our central nervous systems (the former governing which information is accessbile to us and the latter the possible develop ments of our conceptual-perceptual response apparatus). It is consistent</page><page sequence="37">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 445 with Realism, therefore, that the defacto epistemological privileges which some terms enjoy should, as a matter of fact, be unalterable, as long as they are in principle replaceable by theoretical terms (and the cor responding claims open to criticism etc.). And something of just this sort seems to be Maxwell's position.46 (2) The position as Maxwell states it, though already an elaboration of Ramsey's approach, can be elaborated still further. E.g. it is open to the Realist to claim that at some point some of the theoretical terms either (i) actually, or (ii) may in physical principle, or (iii) logically might enter the observational vocabulary, just as Sellars claims they must.471 shall label these positions, respectively, radical, mild radical and conservative quasi-Empiricism. To see how even the mild-radical and conservative quasi-empiricist Realists can reply to this objection, note that they too are commited to the view that it is the satisfying substituents of the bound variables that are the theoretical entities, hence they will claim that there are genuine theoretical terms, namely chosen constants which designate these sub stituents, it is just that these constants have only denotations and no connotations. Of course scientists speak and feel as if their theoretical terms have connotations, but the quasi-empiricist has several moves he can make here; whether these suffice to construct a genuine connotation (at least one of these certainly improves the Ramsey approach) or ex plain the situation away as 'merely psychological' is of lesser interest.48 A presupposition heretofore has been that terms receive a connotation of the sort that counts only if instances of them are observable. The former of the foregoing alternatives would break with this assumption (and right ly so it seems to me, I can see nothing but old empiricist prejudices to recommend it). It has to be admitted, however, that if this assumption is allowed to stand then full-blown theoretical terms fade beyond our actual reach to the realm of mere (logical or physical) possibility. In this case the empiricist bite of these positions would make itself felt. The hard nosed Realist can, however, either choose to grasp this thorn (it is not quite a nettle) and continue with his exposition of theoretical advance and change eschewing all use of full-blown theoretical terms, or, as I said, simply deny the supposition and choose the modified Ramsey approach.49 If, on the other hand, a more radical line is chosen and it is conceded that theoretical terms may be created and can actually usurp the role of the observable terms, then the last of this collection of problems disap</page><page sequence="38">446 C. A. HOOKER pears. Here once again observation as the source of connotation may be safely maintained. There remains, however, to give an account of exactly what is involved - conceptually and psychologically - when the transition happens. The entire range of positions, however, must also face the following problem: What is the relation between the existing observational con cepts and claims made in terms of them and the possible or actual re placing theoretical concepts and corresponding claims? Many people have argued, and there seems strong grounds for believing it, that the world of simple observation and the theoretically described world are incompatible, that the conjunction of all the ordinary descriptions acceded to by com monsense and all the theoretically adequate descriptions cannot be simul taneously true (e.g. Sellars - the 'manifest' and 'scientific' images clash; Feyerabend - common language embodies a false theory). This conclu sion would leave the conservative and mild-radical stuck with an obser vation language for science which is admittedly conceptually inadequate but which they cannot get rid of. However, if it became absolutely nec essary, this thorn too could be grasped. On the other hand a distinction might be made between the adequacy of the concepts of the commonsense conceptual framework themselves and the truth-or-falsity of the beliefs formulated in terms of those concepts - especially if one continued to accept the analytic/synthetic distinction. Now it is not obvious that in some deeper sense the concepts of the common sense conceptual frame work are inadequate, i.e. quite incapable of being used to formulate true - or at any rate experience-supported assertions, as opposed to many deeply embedded commonsense beliefs being in fact false. (Of course the com monsense conceptual framework is inadequate to formulate the deeper intended truths of science, but this is compatible with its possession of adequate concepts for the formulation of shallower truths.) Moreover the sense of'replacement' of commonsense by theoretical concepts would now be a rather benign one, indeed 'addition' might often be the more appropriate description. But if this latter alternative holds then the con flict (though not the difference) between the two conceptual frameworks is removed (though also not the difference in beliefs) and the painfulness of the clash evaporated. In any event this is a line of response at least initially open to the quasi-empiricist, for it does satisfy Sellars' demand that theoretical terms should in principle take on an observational role</page><page sequence="39">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 447 (one which I shall explore further below). What all positions are forced to admit is that, whether in practice or only in principle, the observational language is to become dominated by theoretical predicates when it comes to an objective description of the world. At this point the further radical alternative of denying the observa tional language any special semantical privileges (by denying the existence of observationally conferred connotations) seems increasingly attractive, since by removing any distinction in status between the two sets of terms, except for the pragmatic one of being the terms in which we habitually couch observational reports, we (1) remove the sense of any special break through occurring when theoretical terms enter the observational level (a man is simply re-educated and his choice of observational terms change) and (2) open the way to saying that the clash, if conceded, between the two sets of terms is essentially just a clash between two trial-and-error attempts to describe the world, i.e. only a generalized version of a clash between two theories. In the further account now required of the origins of observational and theoretical concepts the variant claims would run roughly as follows: the conservative and mild-radical variants would claim that of physical necessity, or in fact, the world conditioned in us responses requiring just (terms for) the privileged extensions, while the more radical variant would claim that our conditioned responses are actually, and not just in principle, open to conceptual alteration. It should be appreciated that denying any special semantical status to observational terms (1) does not entail a denial of the analytic/syn thetic distinction (cf. Note 28) and (2) does not entail rejection of the notion of ostensive definition. Once again this is worth emphasizing be cause these rejections, although congenial to a radical semantical position and often found together (e.g. in Quine) do not inevitably go together.50 There is here then a rich variety of quasi-empiricist doctrines compatible with Realism. I have elaborated them at some length because their com patibility with Realism, and their richness, seems to be insufficiently ap preciated. 6.4.2. Anti-Empiricist Realism Paul Feyerabend stands empiricism on its head.51 In the first place, as I have noted, he regards observational terms as simply pragmatically deter</page><page sequence="40">448 C. A. HOOKER mined by various conditioning processes (cf. [30]). But then one can ask "From whence are these terms drawn?" Feyerabend's answer is: From theories - a (sufficiently general) theory determines its own observational language. Correlatively, every observation language becomes 'theory laden' - even so-called natural languages are regarded as embodying primitive theories. Not only is the doctrine of the given denied, any 'natural' observational level is also denied. The observational/theoretical dichotomy disappears from semantics, and nearly from epistemology, into pragmatics, where it is of relatively little importance. It follows that for Feyerabend theories must determine their own se mantic content, hence also that of their observational sublanguages.52 This suggests the notion of implicit definition - an obscure and difficult concept, though some sense can certainly be made of the idea that the syntactical structure of theoretical postulates restricts the range of possible physical models for the theory and in this sense contributes to the relations among the terms. Feyerabend himself has proposed a syntactical ('structural') approach to internally determined semantical content (cf. [33]) though not, I think, very successfully (cf. [2] and my [70]). Attempts to state clearly a plausible and viable notion of implicit def inition are fraught with difficulty. One of these is the danger of collapsing the notion into that of explicit definition. In the present context this would amount to reducing implicitly defined terms to observation terms ? la Empiricism. For Beth has proven an interesting theorem to the following effect : under certain general assumptions a predicate is implicitly definable if and only if it is explicitly definable.53 It seems to me that Beth's theorem deals a serious blow to any plausible notion of full-blown implicit defini tion. Serious, but not in itself deadly. There are essentially two ways around the theorem: reject the criterion of explicit definability as too weak, or that of implicit definability as too strong. A propos of the latter, one could go on to talk of partially implicitly defined predicates which were not required to satisfy so strong a condition as Beth's and so avoid his theorem but, so far as I can see, this is then to say no more than the range of models is partially restricted by the axioms. Conversely, one might insist that explicitly defined terms be expressed by something stronger than an entailed material equivalence, but the possibility of this of course depends upon the resources of the language, in most cases nothing stronger will be available. This suggests that we need the resources of a meta</page><page sequence="41">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 449 language, and indeed there is a strong tradition concerning the nature of implicit definition that formulates its approach metalinguistically ; iron ically, it leads to equally great difficulty of an opposite sort. For in the commonest tradition the notion of internally determined semantic content is in constant danger of reducing to zero the empirical content of a theory by rendering each of its fundamental postulates as an (implicit) tautology. It suggests that a theoretical concept is, in outline, the concept of a set of entities standing in certain relations (specified by the theory) to certain other sets; but if this is the analysis of every term in an assertion (or even of only an appropriate sub-set of the terms) the assertion must become effectively tautologically true.54 Ironically, this analysis offers a restricted semantical content to theoretical terms which is virtually indistinguishable from that offered by the Ramseyan analysis in the quasi-empiricist approach. It begins to appear that an account of wherein 'implicit definition' con sists can only itself be explicitly given on pain of either reducing theories to tautologies or of reducing all implicit definitions to explicit definitions.55 6.4.3. A Middle Way Feyerabend and Sellars agree that ultimately theory must be able to de termine the observational level, they agree that the conceptual framework of common sense and theory clash, and they agree that in some cases the displacement of commonsense observational terms by theoretical terms is actually happening (cf. Sellars [117], [118]). They disagree only about the actual nature and role of natural language in science up to, and including, the present. For Sellars the conceptual structure of natural language is, roughly, constitutive of the objects of common sense, as well as providing the resources for formulating additional theories concerning them - in the sense in which a theory, in the usual sense of the term, has an ob servable domain, described independently of it (namely, in the natural language) and which it is about, natural language is not a theory.56 Correlatively Sellars disagrees with Feyerabend's claim that natural language, more precisely the level of common sense observation terms, can already be dispensed with, for Sellars argues that science has not yet provided a sufficiently complete conceptual schema with which to replace it. In the meantime the natural observation language acts in a de facto</page><page sequence="42">450 C. A. HOOKER epistemologically privileged role as the basis for theoretical acceptance and rejection ([117], p. 186f.). The disagreements here are not just quibbles on Sellars' part, a mere matter of fine judgment of historical timing, for Sellars has a different answer from Feyerabend to our semantical question "Whence comes the semantic content of theories?" According to Sellars, theoretical terms - and here, as with Feyerabend, they are full-blown terms, i.e. predicate constants with connotation and denotation, or at any rate will eventually be so (cf. below) - have two sources of semantical content. (1) There is implicit definition construed as contributing only via the reduction in the range of possible physical models and (2) there is analogical transference of meaning from common sense concepts to theoretical concepts, this transference being mediated by the specific model or models of the theory (roughly, the theoretical concepts and the common sense concepts, though distinct, are said to share a range of higher order attributes in common).57 It is this latter component which is all-important, for implicit definition alone is not sufficient to grant a full measure of meaningfulness to predi cate constants, instead, qua implicitly defined, they are only would-be constants ([117], p. 176), whereas "the distinctive feature of the use of models and analogies in theory construction is that the conceptual frame work of the theory is generated by specifying the analogies which are to obtain" ([117], p. 181). Component 2 grants fullness of meaning to the would-be theoretical predicate constants. It is the eventually-to-be-abandoned observational language of common sense that is itself the external source for the generation of semantic con tent to the successor scientific world view. And "Only if we recognize that the analogy... of the model is not to be construed in terms of the identity or difference of first order attributes, can we appreciate how the use of models in theoretical explanation can generate genuinely new conceptual frame works and justify the claim to have escaped from the myth of the given" ([117], pp. 183-4). Notice that, apart from a more complex account of the relations be tween common sense observation and theory, Sellars' position is very close to that of the mild-radical quasi-empiricist. What Sellars first owes us is an account of analogical transference of semantic content. This is nowhere spelled out in the detail required to cope with an actual theory of science, though it is clear from Sellars'</page><page sequence="43">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 451 writings that some form of modeling is central to the process and internal logical relations also play an important role. What Sellars now owes us of course is an account of how the common sense conceptual framework acquired its semantic content. Any attempt to introduce a succession of frameworks related to one another as theory is to common sense not only does not answer the question, but merely postpones it, while at the same time forcing us back on Neanderthal con cepts (if any) as the basis of contemporary semantics. Any attempt to stop the regress at some language by insisting that meanings in it were directly conferred in observational experience is in danger of returning us to the worst of the empiricist dogmas. Sellars of course is aware of this and attempts to provide a somewhat different account of the emergence of the common sense conceptual scheme. This account is the famous story of our Rylean ancestors who possessed only crude behavioural concepts at first without any explicit concepts of semantic rules but who gradually enriched their language to achieve the full-blown conceptual scheme we have to-day (see [116], Ch. 5). Though the general idea of an evolving conceptual scheme is surely correct, Sellars' account is still clouded by the empiricist's insistence that observation brings something special to concepts, the mechanisms of the semantic 'bootstrap' by which evolution occurred are vague and do not seem to avoid the pressure toward a re gressive language as seeking a pure behavioural reductive base.58 Perhaps if Sellars had given us an account of the origins of the meanings of espe cially the general concepts of the common sense framework we should have a clearer understanding of the matter. 6.4.4. The Problem of Semantical Determination The advantage of quasi-Empiricism is its obvious bowing in the direction of the observation framework of common sense that we all in fact use and its consistency with our intuition that unobservables can only deal in causally mediated structural features of the world whereas perceptibility confers an additional qualitative content to concepts. Even Sellars accepts these features. Its disadvantage is that it seems to restrict theories to a much more poverty-stricken role than we are inclined to give them, for whatever our doubts about them, historical experience tells us that the oretical ideas have dominated the course of scientific knowledge almost</page><page sequence="44">452 C. A. HOOKER everywhere and that, whatever their semantic defects, theories do seem to provide a 'picture' of the true nature of the world. Sellars accepts these features too. The Feyerabendian position at the opposite extreme to quasi-Empiricism has the advantage of taking theories seriously enough; if anything it has the disadvantage of taking them so seriously that they cannot fulfill the role then demanded of them (and the role of an observa tional language is perhaps taken in too cavalier a fashion). The mid-way position occupied by Sellars seems to retain the attractions of the extremes but actually it also seems to possess transpositions of their respective weaknesses. Theories are restricted, ultimately, to logical combinations of would-be predicates (the replacement of the common sense world has yet to occur) depending for their content on analogical transpositions of what are ultimately crudely observational concepts. (Yet if theories are to be truly semantically transcendent the origin of the additional semantic richness escapes us after all, or is itself reduced to observation.) We seem left then hanging somewhere between empiricist observa tionally conferred content and pure implicit definition, with perhaps a third kind of source, as yet unspecified, thrown in (pure imagination perhaps?), to account for the semantic content of theories. And this is, essentially, where I shall be forced to leave the issue. To become any further engrossed in the detail of contemporary proposals for the analysis of semantical content would take us altogether too far afield. The point I wish to stress again is the rich range of these positions which are com patible with Realism. 6.5. Realist Semantics (III): The Criteria of Realism Our second challenge, it will be recalled, was to show how Realism was possible, i.e. to show how that semantical role for theories was possible. This challenge turns out to have no better answer than we can provide to the first. For it is perfectly clear now what must be shown, namely just how theories can come to dominate the observational level - at least in principle. But the mechanism offered for this process will clearly depend in a general way upon the accounts offered of the origins of semantic content for theories canvassed in the preceding. For Feyerabend observa tional languages are simply replaced tout court when theories replace one another - the satisfaction of this criterion offers no special problem, it is</page><page sequence="45">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 453 assumed satisfied from the beginning. Sellars offers us his complex mech anism of analogical transference from the common sense framework, but does not actually say just how theoretical terms acquire a 'reporting role' from there, perhaps the training mechanism is not unlike Feyer abend's (see [27] and [24], pp. 211-218; cf. my [62]). The quasi-Empiricist account as I have developed it has nothing to say on the matter, not sur prisingly since for all but its radical extreme it is not a matter of actual occurrence; still it owes us an account of how the transition might go in principle, this will however be of a somewhat different sort from the ear lier possibilities canvassed here since we would presumably be discussing a counter-factual situation in which the constitution of homo sapiens and/ or that of fundamental physics itself is significantly different from what it actually is. What emerges then is an unanimous silence on the details of the actual mechanism of replacement. In part this silence is surely warranted since it must be a matter of psychological investigation how observation terms actually get replaced or enriched, and whether piecemeal or by entire con ceptual schemes. On the other hand there is a corresponding semantical dimension and we seem not to have any but crude accounts of this - we can choose between replacements tout court (and never mind about the relations between successor languages) and some transitional semantic process (e.g. Sellars' analogical transference), possibly together with the theory of observation terms as pragmatically conditioned responses to sensory nerve bombardment. Despite this unsatisfactory state of affairs, the important positive definite thing I wish to emphasize is the Realist criterion of success, namely ultimate theoretical domination of the ob servation language, in principle. 6.6. Realist Semantics (V): A Second Middle Way 6.6.1. Statement In this section I am going to briefly set down my own tentative selection of doctrines from among those presented in the foregoing. It seems worth while to do only because that selection differs a little from those I can vassed there and because it is intended to represent a comfortably sane position (to be contrasted with the heroism of the extremes). I have labelled</page><page sequence="46">454 C. A. HOOKER it a second middle way.591 would not be overly disturbed to be persuaded that, really, it was essentially a version of radical anti-Empiricism with a mildly modified 'network model' of theories. It should by now be clear that I agree with Sellars that, at least in prin ciple, theoretical terms can acquire an observational role and that theories, ultimately, provide us with our truest characterization of the world. I even agree with Feyerabend (and to the extent to which Sellars accepts Feyerabend's cases, with Sellars) that many theoretical terms have already acquired a reporting role in observation. I agree with Sellars that the terms of the common sense framework are in an epistemologically fa voured position and I even agree that there is something semantically distinctive about such observational terms. But here agreement stops. 6.6.2. A Distinction First let me draw a distinction between a term's acquiring an observa tional role and its acquiring a reporting role in observation. The first of these achievements I construe as follows : A particular concept achieves a status such that the neurological processing structures that are the (cor relates of the) possession of that concept are habitually active in the per ceptual process, i.e. we normally process the incoming sensory information using those structures, i.e. using that concept (among others). I have spelled out this view of perception in detail elsewhere [58] but what this amounts to is that we habitually (i.e. normally) conceptualize our per ceptions using this concept. The concepts of the commonsense frame work typically have this status.60 By 'acquiring a reporting role in ob servation' however I understand only that we respond to perceptual stimulation, in an appropriate set of circumstances, with reports (= de scriptions, claims, identifications etc.) that contain the concept in ques tion. These two statuses are quite distinct, for on the one side there may be ranges of circumstances where we habitually do not employ our per ceptually active concepts but only those that have acquired a reporting role and on the other side concepts may acquire a reporting role in ob servation and yet play no natural part in perceptual processing. This latter comes about through training and education. The most striking examples are probably provided by working scientists. These people are</page><page sequence="47">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 455 educated to respond directly to laboratory situations with reports couched in the technical language of theories. In fact this is exactly how the 'hard' data, or at any rate, the prepared data, are reported, they are 'read' straight off the instruments and this behavioural fact is what gives the overwhelming impression that this is the only significant observational level in science. There is no doubt that psychologically scientists do re spond directly in normal circumstances, i.e. there is no hidden psycho logical inference process involved which moves from the 'real' observation reports, couched presumably in the 'real' observational terms, to reports couched in theoretical terms. Nonetheless there is an important sense in which even these people continue to perceive fundamentally in common sense terms even in those situations where they are not reporting in those terms.*1 What has happened is that through training and education these people are conditioned to respond directly to stimuli with reports couched in terms other than those in which they fundamentally concep tualize those stimuli in perception. The situation is rather like (though to be distinguished from) perceiving situations as theoretical states of affairs. This distinction is largely unappreciated in the philosophy of science.62 Once it is made we can see the elements of truth (but also that of error) in both the empiricist and radical anti-empiricist extremes. Feyerabend is right to think that scientists are not limited to commonsense vocabulary for their observation reports but react directly to perceived situations using the terms of theory because of a pragmatic conditioning process. He is wrong to believe that they leave the commonsense terms behind, or that the observation experience changes conceptually, and for that reason he is wrong to say that the observation language has changed tout court, rather has it been enriched (and perhaps also been modified a little, cf. below).63 Moreover the grain of truth in the empiricist position is, rough ly, that we are stuck with the perceptually active concepts we have be cause these arise from the deeper structure of the world at large and our particular human neurophysiology - and we retreat to this level whenever we wish to make epistemologically less daring claims. But note that epistemological caution does not equal indubitability, nor does it even mean exclusiveness of observational role, much less exclusiveness of se mantical role, nor does it demand to operate at a phenomenalistic sense data level - these are empiricist errors.64</page><page sequence="48">456 C. A. HOOKER 6.6.3. The Nature and Role of Common Language 6.6.3.1. An untheoretical language. The distinction just discussed opens the way to admit to science an observational vocabulary that is theory independent. Consider the perceptually active concepts; there is good neurophysiological and historical-anthropological reason to suppose that these have not changed significantly for millenia. (Aristotle was just as capable of perceiving a shining orb in the blue sky as was Einstein, and they would have agreed on that much despite their distinct theoretical descriptions of the situation.) Moreover, a single scientist may switch belief between totally disparate conceptual-ontological schemes, e.g. be tween field and particle theories, without any shift in his perceptions and commonsense conceptual schema. These claims constitute strong grounds for introducing such a level. Thus these concepts, and the simple general truths that may be stated with them, are common between all the theories of western science, they thus count as theory - neutral or independent in this specific sense.65 The terms of this language represent the perceptually active concepts, they belong to the natural language (the common sense level) and they have been with mankind for millenia, they remain as theories come and go. It is also true that this sub-language has become increasingly irrelevant to science, because the concepts of scientific theories are increasingly re moved from the commonsense level. (Remember that only hard data de scriptions confront theory.) 6.6.3.2. Semantic ambiguity. Understanding the situation here is com plicated by the fact that often the same sign has two (or more) distinct uses, one (or more) at the theoretical level and one at the untheoretical level (e.g. particle, space, exchange). Thus one particular token of the sign-type may be heavily theory-laden, another untheoretical. 6.6.3.3. Theories and common sense language. Quite aside from the the ories that can be specifically formulated using commonsense concepts, these concepts often have an additional theoretical load built into their semantic content.66 This is what partially justifies Feyerabend in referring to common sense language as embodying false theories (in even his op ponent's sense of theory).</page><page sequence="49">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 457 6.6.3.4. Common sense language: is it conceptually inadequate? You will recall that the claim was that the common sense conceptual framework clashed irrevocably with that of science. The implication was that it would have to be abandoned. I proposed denying this latter conclusion. Let us consider the case of a table, described as a solid wooden brown object and perceived in corresponding terms. According to the usual account, the common sense conceptual framework commits one to the existence of a continuous, coloured, impenetrable object with sharp boundaries, but in fact none of these attributes is strictly true of the object before one ac cording to fundamental theory, hence that object must be discarded in toto as mere appearance. In fact, though, fundamental theory and com mon sense agree that there is an object present at very accurately the per ceived location of the table, with boundaries that are very nearly sharp, which does in fact resist penetration from other macro objects to a very high degree and whose interstices are each very small compared with macro magnitudes. If this were not the case it would be a very remarkable world indeed in which theory could explain macro appearance and be haviour. Suppose then that we construe the common sense observation report along these lines "There is a table present which has no visible interstices or breaks at its edges and which permits no perceivable pene tration by other macro objects..." and construe the further claim, when ever it is present in the speaker's meaning, that the table literally is inter stice-free, with sharp boundaries and totally penetration-resistant as a further (unwarranted) primitive explanatory attempt to be exorcized from the commonsense scheme - then we obtain a commonsense claim that even fundamental theory agrees is true. It is clear that the common sense scheme is capable of drawing this distinction internally to itself. I do not claim that the 'purified' common sense scheme thus obtained must of necessity be compatible with fundamental theory in this fashion,67 what I do claim is that in our world we do have this compatibility.68 But this does not extend in quite the same fashion to the secondary qualities, for I believe, contra Sellars, that objects are not e.g. literally coloured at all, though they appear to be. Judgments of this kind must be exorcised from the corpus; what need not be removed are the various true claims that are instances of the general claim that objects possess properties in virtue of which we sense objects in the qualitative fashion we do.69 A very great deal of the common sense scheme remains after these modifications, espe</page><page sequence="50">458 C. A. HOOKER cially outside of the secondary qualities. (I have not discussed numerical concepts, relational concepts, identity concepts and a host of other di mensions to the common sense scheme; in general all of these aspects will be less in need of modification than those I have discussed.) All that has been done is to render that scheme epistemologically more cautious. It is true that this has destroyed the rich theoretical and quasi-theoretical conception of common sense objects tacit in the scheme, but it has left a large portion of what we wish to say of them intact. In sum, I claim that if we rid common sense language of its explicit theories and the implicit theorizing built into semantic content we are left with a theory-neutral scheme whose observational concepts are ex actly the untheoretical concepts of Section 6.6.1.; but these concepts do not clash with theory, they are simply not very relevant as they stand to specific theories from the point of view of testing them. Nonetheless they are a fundamental part of observation and science. This neutral scheme acts as a framework within which all members of a community may orient themselves to one another, irrespective of their theoretical beliefs. Within this common macro world the most important role for science which these untheoretical concepts play is in the keying in of students of a theory to the situations in which they are to apply the theoretically-loaded ob servation terms, i.e. in the process of acquisition of vocabulary with a reporting role. Finally, the scheme has an historical importance as being that out of which science grew (though its semantic role in that process is obscure). Theory enriches this neutral observational vocabulary with its reporting roles, it does not replace it, though in principle it could do so (i.e. the appropriate changes in neuro-physiological perceptual processing will be possible, in principle, if the theory is true - though the transition is very probably not possible under normal human conditions). Theory does, however, criticize and reject old common sense theories and beliefs (where they are false) and likewise for common sense concepts having false theoretical assumptions built into their semantics - here the clash indeed occurs. Since these latter conditions are reasonably widespread in common sense language there is a measure of truth in the usual view, though the error made by attending to it alone dwarfs this truth in im portance. 6.6.3.5. The continuum of theory-ladenness. We find, then, as I earlier</page><page sequence="51">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 459 suggested, a roughly continuous progression from observational reports couched in untheoretical terms through the wide variety of 'half-way house' terms that abound in common language to reports couched in the technical terms of some specific theory. (Common language is full of terms, or particular word uses for a given sign, that are semi-theoretical, largely through a slow osmotic transfer process from earlier theories. E.g. metal, acid, vacuum, level. These terms come to be integrated into the commonsense conceptual structure.) 6.6.3.6. Why untheoretical? There are two senses in which even our com mon sense perceptually active concepts involve a theory-like commitment. To see what the first sense is, we begin again with the doctrine of per ception. That doctrine informs us that a logical prerequisite of perceptual experience is the possession of a perceptually active conceptual scheme, i.e. the possession of the appropriate cortical processing structures. (Phys ically, the possession of these structures is a co-requisite of perception.) But in a very general way the conceptual scheme which is perceptually active embodies a metaphysics (it may in fact be capable of embodying several distinct metaphysical schemes). Thus the categories of perception themselves will reflect a very general commitment to a metaphysics for the world. In our own case, for example, we habitually perceive the world in terms of individuals located in a three-dimensional space and changing in time, though the four-dimensional space-time world of relativity theory and the continuous plenum world of field theory represent two logically possible alternative metaphysical schemes which might have been our perceptually active scheme. In this sense then our habitual categorizing in perception involves a very general commitment to a view of the world as made up in a certain way. Since I hold that even general metaphysics is ultimately open to criticism in an exactly similar fashion to which the ories are criticizable (except for the time scale of criticism), this commit ment can properly be said to be a theory-like commitment. There is a second, much more direct, sense in which the concepts of the common sense scheme, a fortiori those of the untheoretical scheme (Section 6.6.3.5.), contain a theoretical component, namely, it is simply not possible to teach those concepts or guarantee the publicness (inter subjectivity) their social use demands unless they are understood (whether tacitly or explicitly) to function in some laws (cf. e.g. Hesse [57], pp. 44f).</page><page sequence="52">460 C. A. HOOKER E.g. one only has to think of the network of geometrical laws in which shape and size predicates are imbedded. The realization of this is anyway immediate once one reflects upon the complex array of laws that must be tacitly understood before even ostensive definition can be made to work. (Pointing as a human act must be understood, the behaviour of sight in relation to the body, the kind of thing being pointed out etc. etc.)70 Most of the laws involved are tacitly understood and seem only partially re flected in the semantics of the scheme (how deeply imbedded is the law that a spherical body will roll on a flat surface? roll forever? - cf. locally euclidean but globally non-euclidean geometry), though the laws could be stated within the commonsense frame if necessary.71 It would appear that one cannot easily make a sharp distinction here between tacitly held and semantically integral laws, nor easily between theoretical extrapolation and untheoretical perception. To claim, e.g., that a spherical object will roll forever on a flat surface seems clearly a theoretical extrapolation from commonsense experience; to claim only that an object rolls smoothly on the perceivable parts of a perceptually flat surface to the degree it is perceptually spherical, so long as one is not under illusion, is plausibly untheoretical. What this suggests is that strip ping away the theoretical extrapolation from the common sense scheme may not lead to an obvious sharp demarcation of the untheoretical. This is not a disaster because ultimately it will be recalled, the criterion of the observationally untheoretical is that of active role in perceptual processing. This latter can be determined, in principle, experimentally (irrespective of the outcome on the theory-commitment issue). There never was anything to guarantee that the stripping process for the commonsense scheme outlined in Section 6.6.3.4. would yield exactly the observable untheoretical concepts so defined or that these latter would forever remain theory-neutral.72 This discussion makes it clear that neither sense of theory like commit ment is logically different from straightforward theoretical commitment, the difference comes in the different processes by which the commitments came to be made (the one by a conscious, verbal process of theoretical postulation, the other through unconscious neurophysiological adjust ment), and the different epistemological roles they play in the philosophy of science (the untheoretical plays an ultimately dependent, but critical, role in the inter-theoretic orientation of the human community).73 Cer</page><page sequence="53">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 461 tainly the untheoretical scheme, like the theoretical scheme, has been (and probably still is being) elaborated over time in the light of experience, though again by different processes. Like our theories, this elaboration might go wrong (though it would have to do so in systematic ways to allow survival). As I have said, one could imagine circumstances under which fundamental theory informed us that many or all of our perceptual ly active concepts did not apply - we were under systematic illusion. Nonetheless we have excellent reason to believe that nothing has gone wrong in the process grounded on (i) general considerations concerning what is known of the mechanisms of neurophysiological processing ad justment, (ii) historical evidence, (iii) the agreement of fundamental the ory with untheoretical commonsense.74 I regard it therefore as a reason able thesis that throughout the history of western science there has existed an untheoretical conceptual scheme, that its observational component is made up of exactly those concepts active in perceptual processing and that it can be arrived at very closely by stripping commonsense concepts of their overt and tacit theoretical commitments.75 6.6.4. The Semantical Content of Theories I have no more informative account to offer of the sources of semantic content for theoretical terms than that with which I concluded Section 6.4.4. It does seem to me however that, bearing in mind the information processing model of conceptual activity, the imaginative roles of what we call association of ideas, analogy, and very probably many transitions for which we presently have no useful name, should not be under-esti mated in their contribution to a conceptual and, derivatively, a linguistic, framework because of a precommitment to some 'origins' doctrines of meaning where every concept has to be built up logically from some privi leged class of initial concepts.76 6.6.5. Why Realist? Recapitulation The reader will recognize the foregoing account as a form of mild-radical quasi-empiricist account of the observation language, with perhaps a more liberal view of the possible sources of semantic content for theoretical terms.77 The compatibility of this view with Realism I have already ar gued. I simply remind the reader that to this position must be added the epistemology and structural view of science of earlier sections.</page><page sequence="54">462 C. A. HOOKER 7. A REALIST ALTERNATIVE REJECTED: THE LEVELS HYPOTHESIS In a recent, important book [40] J. C. Graves has defended a form of Scientific Realism which I shall call the levels hypothesis. I shall endeav our to explain the view and then give my reasons for rejecting it as a serious alternative open to the Realist.78 Despite Graves' rejection of Empiricism, arid that of the epistemological tradition in which it stands, the notion of a level for Graves is first an epistemic one: Graves introduces cognitive levels (p. 17), only later do we slip into ontological levels. The reason for this priority seems to be that Graves thinks of levels as tied to theories and theories, Graves reminds us, are obviously epistemic affairs (p. 19). Actually, the closest we come to a definition is this: A level is the range of validity of a theory (p. 19). This definition no doubt accounts for Graves' willingness to countenance many different types of levels, e.g. that specified in the size hierarchy of physics, the order of evolution of complexity (whether chemo-biological or social) and so on (pp. 18-19). Intuitively, Graves seems to have in mind that a theory (or at any rate a sufficiently general one - whatever that may come to) typically either concerns a class of phenomena described in terms more or less unique to itself (cf. molecular chemistry versus cybernetics) or pretty clearly is concerned with the world only within some delimited domain (cf. quantum molecular theory vs general relativity). Obviously there is some truth to this claim. Before pressing on from epistemology to ontology, let us pause to con sider the notion of a cognitive level. Even definitions using epistemic components may not define epistemic entities. Such is the case with Graves' definition of a level. For a Realist, the range of validity of a theory selects an objective sub-division of the world; though a theory may be epistemic qua constructed by man seeking knowledge, its truth conditions are non epistemic states of affairs (though of course any description we give of them will be in the terms of some theory). Moreover, the definition is not easily understood clearly, because no theory defines its own range of validity. This is always a question of combining experience with mathemat ical meta-theorems (i.e. meta to the theory). But how experiments are interpreted and combined with such mathematics is itself a matter for theory, and not usually just the theory in question but others also, and even an entire world view as well.</page><page sequence="55">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 463 Nonetheless, there is a certain plausibility about the notion of cognitive levels; we do seem e.g. to know about tables and their putative atomic constituents in fairly different ways, or anyway different contexts - cer tainly the descriptive languages are different. But taken only thus far the idea is of minimal philosophical interest, it expresses no more than a rather obvious reference point for all philosophy of science. Notoriously, nothing follows for ontology from such epistemological remarks, for a Realist. How then does Graves arrive at ontological levels? By following the empiricist order of proceeding again: from episte mology to semantics. The different cognitive levels will in general have, as I just said, somewhat different concepts associated with them. Graves takes this to yield prima facie distinct ontologies for the various levels. Graves concedes the possibility of reduction of one ontic level to another but offers a number of arguments for believing that many levels are and must remain, ontologically distinct. So then, the levels hypothesis turns out not to be merely an innocuous superficial description of science but a serious claim concerning the structure of reality. Now we can reverse the procedure and claim the ontological levels structure as grounding the various epistemic-descriptive levels. I shall not recount here all of the ad vantages Graves lists for this approach, none of them are guaranteed unique to the levels view, though certainly Graves is saved a lot of work on the relations among theories that someone who believes in only one level is in for. The alternatives which this hypothesis foists on one I find totally un acceptable in the light of experience to date. Let us assume first P: No two material objects can be in the same place at the same time, and second Q: The spatio-temporal world structure consists of a single 4-dimensional spatio-temporal manifold. Now consider any two ontic levels which Graves believes distinct, e.g. the common sense level and the atomic level. Suppose we consider a table T and the corresponding collection of atoms ti(i=l,...,~ 1024). Let the table occupy the volume V at time t and the atoms respectively the volumes V? at time t. Now if the table T is onto logically distinct from the structured collection of atoms T', then either P is false, or Q is false or R is false, where R is : Position measurements indicated that Vi a V, most /. On the assumption that R is an experi mental truth, no one to my knowledge doubts that the structured collec tion of atoms is located where the table is located (actually, all I need is</page><page sequence="56">464 C. A. HOOKER the weaker 3V?:vicz V, which takes care of 'fuzzy edge' arguments)), either P or Q must be false. But I can see no reason to believe either that we live in a world with multiple spaces of which we are all somehow simultaneously conscious, or that two distinct objects can occupy the same placetime.79 Graves in fact offers three arguments for the claim that, irrespective of the consequences, levels must be considered ontologically distinct.80 None of these arguments withstands examination.81 I can therefore see nothing to recommend Graves' position. It would appear that he is a victim of precisely that order of priorities adopted by Empiricism, which he criticized so sharply. (How few confessed anti empiricists truly escape empiricist assumptions ! - A caution to the reader of this paper.) The goal of Realism is nothing less than the construction of the true model of reality, a unified account of the world, including its reasoning inhabitants. Graves' pluralism of levels - cognitive, linguistic and ontological - destroys that unity and the motive to seek it. 8. Methodology The three revolutions (Section 1) are reflected also in methodology. Meth odology I take to be a branch of pragmatics, roughly it asks and answers the question "Given the existing circumstances, which strategy best furth ers the development of knowledge?" Empiricism construed 'the existing circumstances' narrowly to include just the known facts and theories preceding the time in question (and it construed 'knowledge' equally narrowly to mean a collection of propo sitions formulated in the favorite formal manner).82 Feyerabend and Hanson especially have attacked this methodology vigorously.83 Though neither of these writers seems to have explicitly formulated the full-blown alternative to the empiricist programme adumbrated above both instinc tively attacked the empiricist's science and attempted to replace it with a rational account oriented towards scientists. In this context the full force of methodology as providing a strategy for increasing knowledge is evident - each scientist faces the full culture of his time and must act in the light of all the likely repercussions of any given action. Feyerabend has illustrated this point brilliantly in his study of Galileo (and he was making points primarily about epistemic strategy, not simply about Galileo's per</page><page sequence="57">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 465 sonality, though we must begin back there for a full-blown explanation of the actual course of science). The methodological conclusion to be drawn from an epistemology of ignorance, in the light of the revolutions in philosophy of science, is that a vigorous pluralism is called for. When it comes to theoretical ideas 'Let the hundred flowers bloom'. The reasoning is simple enough. Since we begin in ignorance and with very limited sensory equipment, we have only our native wit to help us to an imaginative conceptual grasp of the world; experience shows that the most effective way to develop such insights is in the constant critical play of ideas against one another. Within the empiricist tradition one had such reverence for the domain of 'facts' that they were endowed with large powers, e.g. the power to point out the path of theoretical progress (if one countenanced such at all seriously), but once that myth is abandoned in recognition of the pitiful limitedness of our senses the way is open to concentrate on a use where experience can be of moderately powerful service, as a judge at the sensitive empirical meeting points of incompatible theo ries. How vigorous the pluralism is depends upon other factors in one's philosophy.84 In my own case I am at liberty to exploit the approximate sameness of the phenomenal level for all scientists, despite the possible incommensurability of the hard data claims. But in addition I believe that Feyerabend has seriously over-emphasized and over-simplified the semantic disparities between general theories because of his neglect of the complex roles of models and so-called auxiliary theories. Even for our most general theories, sub-models of theoretical models may coincide. More importantly, a powerful theory can model in its mod elling resources the models of another theory (thereby explaining why they broke down and the degree of the failure). It will also generally be necessary that incompatible theories share a range of auxiliary theories in common. Methodology is a branch of pragmatics for the Realist, its methods dictated (in part) by semantics and epistemology; it is not necessary here that I go into great detail. My own view is that every case of the clash of theories needs detailed analysis as to the semantics of the two theories, the range of models constructible and the relations between hard data reports and phenomenal experience before any verdict can be given as to the</page><page sequence="58">466 C. A. HOOKER precise locus of the clash - so far as I can see, every (important) case differs in philosophically important respects. 9. Epistemology (hi): the history of science With respect to the history of science we are faced with two extremes. On the one side is the empiricist's account where we have an ever-accu mulating pile of facts with theories representing increasingly good orga nizations of them. Theories then supercede one another according to the objective criterion of adequacy to organize the data, they are mutually compatible where they overlap, indeed earlier theories are just for this reason reducible to special cases of their successors. The history of science presents a superbly rational front. At the other extreme alternative the ories determine their own semantic content and that of the observation language and the domain of theory-neutral facts is entirely destroyed. In this case we cut ourselves off from any rational account of the history of science as a continuous process. For then a change of scientific theory becomes a fundamental semantical shift of the entire vocabulary, it is therefore impossible to meaningfully compare theories, and therefore im possible to give any rational account of progress from one theory to another. Both extremes are unacceptable.85 Ultimately, what account we offer of the history of science must depend upon the account we offer of human beings. Both extreme views, in their several ways, simply bring their a priori assumptions concerning ratio nality and epistemology (especially observation) to bear upon history forcing it into the necessary mold.86 Let me now elaborate briefly the sources of continuity in the history of science which I have still allowed myself, though we can expect the account to be elaborated and probably modified as more information becomes available. First of all there is the existence of an essentially untheoretical obser vational level which provides for a source of common experience to the scientists of an entire culture and therefore for the scientific tradition throughout an entire culture (e.g. that of western man during the last 2500 y). Since each theory must confront such elementary observational experience, however tenuous this connection be, each theory can be com pared in point of its success in this regard. As we have seen, however, such comparisons will not bear great weight in the decision among the</page><page sequence="59">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 467 ories because of the necessity of the transposition of such experience into a form suitable for direct confrontation with the theory in question.87 Second, and at the opposite end of the scale, as it were, I have suggested that there are broad metaphysical conceptions of the world, and corre lative to them broad conceptual descriptive schemes for the world, which have been carried essentially unchanged through the entire history of science. These very general conceptions of the world therefore also re present an element of continuity in the scientific process.88 Intimately connected with such broad descriptive schemes lie certain broad mathe matical structures which also run continuously through the history of science.89 Within this limited continuity provided at the extreme ends of the scientific structure, however, I believe we must admit that wholistic changes in scientific theories have occurred through imaginative 'leaps' on the part of individual scientists which can be followed only at the indivi dual level and probably cannot be given a rational reconstruction within Science. Nevertheless, we should not under-estimate the force of the above two sources of continuity, for I believe that such imaginative leaps as there are have always arisen out of a detailed controversy concerning certain specific characteristics or defects of an existing theory90 and the particular solutions which have been adopted have always been adopted with an eye to conforming to the fundamental metaphysical-conceptual schemes of the culture and (as far as possible) to the fundamental mathe matical structures of the preceding theory. To what extent the theories may be compared in detail on this view of the history of science, i.e. to what extent the meanings of theoretical terms are theoretically determined, and to what extent there is any common sharing of ontologies between competing theories, we shall leave as open questions here. My general conclusion is that the history of science is one of continuous creation under the careful constraints of a rationally reconstructable continuity. Finally I raise the question of whether these culture-wide aspects of science cannot themselves in some way be opened to critical examination. I suggest the view that ultimately both of these aspects are open to the same kind of critical reappraisal as are any other elements in the structure of science - it is just that the reappraisal time is so much longer than for other elements and the reappraisal process so much more complex and difficult to realize.91</page><page sequence="60">468 C. A. HOOKER In respect of the perceptual level it is difficult to imagine that our per ceptual organization would have even this much flexibility, precisely be cause it is so clearly determined in large measure by our neurological make-up, and we have reason to believe that this was acquired only after millennia of evolutionary experience. Nevertheless, there is reason to be lieve that this neurological make-up has some degree of flexibility built into it (cf. [54]) and one cannot help but at least consider it possible that over the course of a much longer period of time (perhaps millennia) the conditions under which man operated, cultural and perhaps also neuro logical, could so change as to alter his fundamental perceptual organiza tion, i.e. to alter the concepts active in perception and/or the manner in which they function together. Indeed there is talk of an 'evolutionary epistemology' [21], if so it will be a naturalistic epistemology, one whose course is critically understood within science. POSTSCRIPT The reader will recognize that it is not possible to do more here than provide a sketch of many of the aspects of a systematic Realist position - in particular, this is true of an account of scientific discovery and scientific change, reduction and the unity of the sciences, the nature of values and their roles in the sciences and the relations between the pursuit of science and cultural activities generally. For the same reason the notes often con tain more substantive material than their conventional role would justify. Even so, the space this essay occupies is substantial and I wish to express my gratitude for the generosity of Prof. Jaakko Hintikka and Synthese. NOTES 1 Thus there is no insistence here on identification of theory with a linguistic formula tion in some used language (whether common language or that of the scientist), mathe matical-logical formulation of a theory is acceptable, the theory being identified equally with the set of axioms set down or with the class of intended models of those axioms (i.e. physically irrelevant models are eliminated). Equally, I do not assume that the Realist is concerned only with theoretical entities (i.e. individual substances) but admit theoretical properties also, nor assume that these latter are predicated only of theoretical entities, nor observable properties only of non theoretical entities - cf. Achinstein [1], Putnam [103], Sellars [117] etc. But this is only to forewarn the reader of issues to be discussed in what follows. 2 One of the problems arising here is the so-called 'incommensurability' of world views :</page><page sequence="61">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 469 by definition, a truly complete world view contains a cohering version of everything (ethics, ontology, epistemology, linguistics, science etc.), thus one can never 'get out side' it, there is no neutral ground; but in this case we all seem doomed to forever be unable to even discuss issues seriously with our opponents (and vice versa), since such discussion, if it is to be a genuine meeting of minds, must be on neutral ground. For tunately, the following condition seems adequate to guarantee rational debate without presupposing neutral ground: that each world view be rich enough to faithfully re present within itself opposing world views. Our ability to talk about other structures (logical, mathematical) using a particular structure, other languages using a particular language, is wide indeed. Hov/ever, this possibility does not by itself guarantee that decision among world views will be rational, or determine what the basis of that de cision is. I have hinted here and in [73] that a strong ethical component is involved. 3 Feyerabend and Kuhn have been greatly misunderstood (and perhaps have even misunderstood themselves) in this because almost everyone operates with the primary notion of Science. From this perspective one accuses them of confusing psychology and sociology with epistemology and methodology, or of introducing total irrationality into Science. But once one views their work from the new perspective then much of what is puzzling falls into place. E.g. Kuhn's account of paradigm-dominated science is to be seen as articulating the total epistemic context from within which decisions in some historical period are made and Feyerabend's account of Galileo-as-propagandist is to be understood as a rational account of 'gambling with truth' in an ideologically epistemically loaded situation etc. Cf. my remarks in [73]. 4 The term 'new epistemology' derives from a paper of G. C. Nerlich's which I saw during the summer of 1972 and which proved very helpful in clarifying some of my ideas. Already a year earlier than that I had been independently thinking about the problem as e.g. my brief remarks in [64] indicate. About that time I re-discovered the importance of Quine's 'Epistemology Naturalized' (in [108]). I am also indebted to John Nicholas for some further ideas that arose out of discussion of a paper of his in October 1972. 5 A characteristically clear earlier statement of this position is found in Quine's 'Episte mology Naturalised' (in [108]). According to Quine, the abandonment of the Empiri cist semantical and epistemological programme for science (respectively dogmas 3 and 4) leaves no task remaining for the traditional conception of epistemology and it must either be abandoned (as e.g. the later Wittgenstein would have) or reduced to a branch of psychology, specifically to the question of how in fact creatures with our make-up arrive at our beliefs. Similarly, Quine sees no role for the traditional approach to se mantics, but in this case advocates its abandonment in favour only of a theory of reference and truth. (In similar fashion we might construe Quine and Davidson - pace Nerlich- as suggesting that the abandonment of the traditional approach to the nature of truth shifts philosophic interest from a pointless issue to two real problems: how to speak coherently of truth - a problem solved by Tarski - and how to account for the knowledge of infinitely many truths when a finite language is employed.) In my view though, Quine overstates the case, for he makes it sound as if all critical reflection upon science is to be abandoned in favour of just science. I surely believe, along with armchair philosophers, that one has to distinguish the critical appraisal of science from science, otherwise the latter becomes blind. Quine on the other hand, seems bent upon excluding normative considerations entirely. Quine is right that the criteria of episte mically justified action merge much more conspicuously into the general criterion of rational action but, I think, too hasty in dropping the normative dimension of the</page><page sequence="62">470 C. A. HOOKER latter. And it is not true that normative theories cannot be informed by experience. What is really needed is a dynamical theory of the interaction of normative and de scriptive theories as experience changes - but to supply that here would lead us too far afield. Quine is not quite right, the key question is not simply 'How do men in fact theorize in response to stimulation?' but something closer to 'Given creatures of our construction, in our circumstances, including the answer to Quine's question, which parts of science are epistemically justified? How should the rational man respond theoretically?' While on the subject of this important essay, let me gather together one or two other remarks concerning the views expressed in it. Quine, as always, is unrepentantly empiricist about language, about meaning espe cially. The only place we have anything remotely satisfactorily identifiable as meaning are the so-called observation sentences and their meaning is stimulus meaning. But by his own lights, Quine should surely wait upon the deliverances of psychology in this area ! For all we know, a rich notion of meaning will be forthcoming that departs radi cally from stimulus meaning, it might be that the human mind has an inner predilection and facility for the abstract. Even Quine's own notion of stimulus meaning must be supplemented by internal stimuli if it is to make any sense of the distinctions between an observation report uttered in veridical, illusory and hallucinatory circumstances (a point I made while reviewing a thesis, and then discovered it made independently by Shick [115]) -who can tell a priori how rich these inner stimuli are? My own remarks on semantics which follow show my Quinean uneasiness with the notion of meaning, but I am unwilling to write it off (or down) in his fashion until more is understood about the relations between language, thought and action - cf. Note 68. Quine is also quick to point out how under the new epistemology the notion of an absolute observation sentence loses its sense to be replaced by some notion concerning nearness to stimulation in the causal chain. I think this must be right. But his quick step from there to a Feyerabendian pragmatic theory of observation where what counts as an observation sentence depends upon no more than the gross behaviour of the linguistic community is just too quick. It ignores what psychology may tell us (to double Quine's irony - p. 88), and this may be important in relation to the view of theories taken. For example, if psychological research suggests a permanently fixed fund of observational concepts with no conditioning possible then Feyerabend will be simply wrong. If, as I believe - cf. below - we must distinguish sharply sensory content from observational reporting, with conditioning essentially affecting only the latter, then Feyerabend has too simplistic a view and the quasi-empiricist Ramsey account is in some difficulty. Because it suggests none of this detail, Quine's vague proposal is un helpful and uninformative. 6 Though not destroy, of course, the insight that a man might adopt the right beliefs for the wrong reasons. But the standard account makes the bridging of the dualism in a fashion which does reasonable justice to the history of science almost impossible. 7 I am indebted to discussions with J. J. Leach on these issues - the reader interested in this approach to induction is invited to consult his [83], as well as Luckenbach [85]. 8 Cf., e.g., the discussion by Maxwell [90], [91]. 9 Roughly speaking, these correspond respectively e.g. to Hospers' concept empiricism and judgment empiricism - cf. [75], Chapter 2. 10 The reader is referred to the standard literature for a statement (and appraisal) of these doctrines - see, e.g., Achinstein &amp; Barker [4], Aune [8], Ayer [9], Carnap [23], [24], Feyerabend [27], [28], Hempel [47], [48], Nagel [92], Pap [95], Quine [106], [107]. Cf. Lewis [84].</page><page sequence="63">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 471 11 This remark is explained a little later on. Historically, it is probably the case that explicit Conventionalism is a late arrival, being considerably pre-dated by Instru mentalism (perhaps better called Fictionalism) which played a dominent role in the discussions of the significance of astronomy from Ptolemy onwards. Cf. e.g. the remarks by John Winnie in an as yet unpublished paper 'Realism Without Regrets'. Winnie also discusses the historically operative auxiliary motives for support for Instrumen talism; roughly, they come down to this: Instrumentalism can be invoked to nullify any theoretical view that one has independent grounds (empiricist, religious, ideolo gical, etc.) for wanting nullified. Originally, I had intended to deal only with the various particular kinds of conven tion that might appear in a physical theory, in a later section. (I still do this, see my paper [68], Sections I, II). Prof. J. O. Wisdom convinced me that to do only this would be an error. Furthermore, the expression of the conventionalist position (though not my basic understanding of it) is indebted to a recent discussion of Wisdom's-see [136]. Though I do not follow his solution, his discussion contains many illuminating remarks. Further discussion of Conventionalism can be found in the references of Note 8 an in Wisdom [137]. 12 But first let us be absolutely clear that Realism (my Realism) concedes the initial premise of this general attack. Prescinding for the moment from the question of how the actual structure of science is best represented (further on which see below), let us consider the traditional (Empiricist, Conventionalist) structural theory: Level Type o ? 5* (1) &lt;*)(... 7\..) ? | (2) (x)(...T,0...) |, ? (3) &lt;*)(...0...) (4) ...0,a... The structural relationships hold among them, in general, as the arrows suggest. Level (1) contains only initially universally quantified expressions containing only theoretical terms. (That is, I assume the initial quantifier to be universal, although it may be fol lowed by one or more existential quantifiers; actually, I have some sympathy for the view that we could possibly find a fundamental law essentially expressible only with a first existential quantifier but here I need only the conclusion that the kinds of laws stated do occur in science, and in fact they predominate.) This first level is the level of 'pure theories'. (Not all theories have such a level and it is not clear what 'pure' involves here, but I let that pass for the moment.) Level (2) has similarly quantified expressions that mix observational and theoretical terms. These supply the so-called 'correspon dence rules'. Level (3), while similarly quantified, contains only observational terms the observational generalizations. Level (4) contains the unqualified sentences reporting 'facts'. In this standard account level (3) is deducible from levels (l) + (2) and some members of level (4) from other members together with level (3). Each level is imagined deductively axiomatized and the whole likewise. Fact : only members of level (4) (and perhaps also a very small and uninteresting sub-class of level (3)) are sense-confirmable (i.e. can have their truth values ascertained on the basis of sensory experience). (The members of level (3) which I have in mind might be assertions of the form 'All the marbles in the palm of John's hand are red', where 'marbles' is understood as speci fying an object at least one centimeter in diameter.) Conclusion: no interesting level (3) sentences, and a fortiori no level (1) or level (2) sentences at all, are sense-confirmable. Logical truth: no inference from any collection of level (4) sentences to any collection</page><page sequence="64">472 C. A. HOOKER of level (3) sentences is ever deductively valid. (Even if the level (4) sentences in fact exhaust a class of beasties, that particular fact is not reported among them.) Fact: no instance of a theoretical predicate is ever observable (qua theoretical predicate - but cf. Note 1). Conclusion: not even a single instance of level (1) and level (2) sentences is sense-confirmable. A fortiori, a fortiori level (1) and (2) sentences are not sense-con firmable. There is no escaping this conclusion. Fact: the increased expressive richness of levels (1) and (2) permits an infinite variety of theories to deductively imply the same subset of sense-accessible level (4) sentences and hence be 'empirically equivalent'. (Notice that this is a loaded, anti-Realist conception of empirical equivalence. The Realist will say only that they are observationally equivalent.) Now the Realist is apt to reject the strict observational/theoretical dichotomy on which this structure is based and from which its epistemology flows. Even so, he will be hard-pressed to reject, as generally adequate, the hierarchy of logical form posed (skipping the observational status of the predicates occurring in the theories) and hence cannot reject the problem of the invalidity of the inference from instance to generaliza tion. (In [56] Mary Hesse writes as if the whole structural description could be rejected, I suppose on the grounds that the 'network model' has no use for such hierarchies, cf. [57], but this is surely to exaggerate. True, epistemologically loaded hierarchies such as the observational/theoretical, or concrete/abstract will not follow without further epistemological assumptions from a structural description, but it is implausible to reject the formal deductive hierarchy since analyses of actual theories suggests that, by and large, it is appropriate (see the appendix of my [71] for an instance where pure deduction doesn't suffice going 'downward'). The empiricist analysts (Carnap, Hempel, etc.) certainly were familiar with formal analyses of scientific theories.) However, in addition I at least accept that there is an important element of truth in the empiricist observational/theoretical dichotomy (though I do not by any means think they have stated this correctly), and so I, and more generally anyone who is pre pared to concede that theories even often deal with unobservable entities, must concede the general epistemological conclusion drawn above from the traditional structure (see below for a detailed discussion of the alternative Realist position here). This agreed feature of the epistemology of science is the basis for the attacks of the opponents of Realism. 13 I shall present here only the briefest recapitulation of the attacks on Empiricism, my aim being to show how they presuppose alternative world-positions. Psychologically, Locke's account of concept formation is plausible only if one ne glects the hereditary structure of the central nervous system and its powers, allowing the mind only logical operations with which to transform the only ideas (concepts) it is allowed, namely those given directly in sensory experience. This is the power of the view - it is also its great empirical weakness. The view of concepts inherent in the doc trine assumes them to be conscious, linguistic units, whereas a more adequate view recognizes the notion of information-processes in the central nervous system as the fundamental units - in this latter case one obtains a more effective account of concept formation and a very great enrichment of the category of concepts. (Some of the rami fications are lightly spelled out in my [74], cf. Note 64.) The only dispute among psy chologists today is how rich the hereditary structure is (less rich it seems, than Kant thought it was) and how the fantastically rich variety of imaginative transpositions occur. (See, for example, [41], [43], [77], [97], [102], [139] in bibliography; for a more detailed discussion of perception see my [58].) And Realism takes science, hence psy chology, seriously.</page><page sequence="65">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 473 As a bold statement of the appropriate analysis of the psychology of percep tion, the dogma 3-dogma 4 combination is found similarly wanting (there is none but superficial evidence for the existence of simple units, givens, in perceptual ex perience - cf. my [58], Chapter 4 and the references cited there), and as a charac terization of the history of science dogma 4 is again inadequate (plenty of obser vational claims have been revised in the light of experience, see especially the studies by Feyerabend [27], [28], [29], [32]), yet a sufficiently 'hard-nosed' empiricist might insist on retaining dogma 4 as an in-retrospect and in-principle analysis of per ceptual claims and of the progress of science (using some subtle theses concerning descriptions to counter the objections - cf. Section 6.4 below). Philosophically, doctrines 2, 3, 4 and 5 have come under attack. There are powerful arguments to show that, contra P-Empiricism and Empiricism dogma 3, theoretical terms as they occur in actual theories of science cannot be defined in terms of purely observational vocabulary. (Cf. the works by Aune [7], Nagel [92], and Pap [95] and Sneed [123]. One of the kinds of arguments that does not work for (or respectively against) Empiricism is the argument from the formal separability of the observational from the theoretical part of science, for it presupposes the rejection of Realism (re spectively, Empiricism) - cf. my [59], [60].) These arguments are 'nice' because they largely hinge on features of extant theories that any plausible view would want to in corporate. The honest point is, polemically, that to offer an interpretation of a theory is not simply to show how its heretofore uninterpreted terms are connected to 'simple' observation, but to say what is really going on in the world as opposed to, but ex planatory of, what appears to be, is observed to be, going on. One does not want to know merely that in circumstances C and instrument dial reads R but what is really going on between the instrument and the world such that it comes to read R. This clearly involves theoretical ontology but it also involves other things, e.g. a theory of perception, which Empiricism ignores. Nonetheless our hard-nosed empiricist might cling to his reconstruction of science as the only ultimately justifi able one. (Recently Maxwell has claimed that Russell's doctrine of the knowledge by acquain tance/knowledge by description dichotomy, bolstered by the application of his theory of definite descriptions to a Ramsey approach to theories (for Russell's doctrines see [112], [113], cf. Maxwell, [89], [90], [91], and for Ramsey's approach see [109], cf. Sec tion 6 below for a detailed examination) reconciles concept Empiricism with Realism, for in this case we use only observation terms and logic to refer to theoretical entities. More precisely, Maxwell has dogma 3 alone in mind, he rejects dogmas 2 and 4 and would reject dogmas 1 and 5 I believe, and only a ^-Empiricist version since not every term is reducible without remainder to observation terms, specifically not the described theoretical terms. Tentatively I believe this claim to be correct; tentatively, because the Realism that results is so pallid I am not sure it can stand - cf. Section 5.4. If so, what this demonstrates is that if you cut one of the empiricist dogmas off severely enough from a systematic view and weaken it sufficiently it becomes compatible with almost anything.) The Verifiability Criterion of Meaning which is the general semantical support for the foregoing construction has come under severe attack and has now generally been abandoned. (This is essentially part of the attack on dogma 3, see [1], [4], [7], [9], [l 5], [23], [24], [47], [48] [49], [50],[51], [57], [92], [95], [100], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [116], [122], [126], [129], [130].) Indeed the Security Dogma has the characteristic that it only needs to be clearly stated for its implausibility to be evident. The Epistemological</page><page sequence="66">474 C. A. HOOKER Dogma is somewhat weaker (and subtler for this reason) but its support also comes from the same basic empiricist doctrines - indeed, it is the kind of doctrine for which none other than this kind of support is imaginable. Recently the legitimacy of the observational/theoretical distinction has been attacked (see Achinstein [1], Putnam [103]), but not, I think, effectively against a 'hard-nosed' opponent. (The argument here is parallel to that immediately below. Cf. also Suppe [125].) Quine and Putnam, among others, have attacked dogma 2, with uncertain suc cess. (Quine [106], [107], Putnam [105]. Quine's argument seems to hinge on the claim that if any of a collection of terms can only be inter-defined (i.e. defined in terms of each other) then the whole collection wants for sense. (So much the worse for language !) Why should not an empiricist introduce his preferred language, already complete with a sharp analytic/synthetic distinction (as Carnap wants to) and then lay down explicit syntactic definitions of these semantical categories as a fait accompli! (The extensions of these semantical terms can be claimed to approximate - and merely sharpen - our preanalytic intuitions.) Besides, it would seem that Quine's preferred remainder to semantics (truth, reference etc.) is in no better position on this score (and on some others, cf. my [61].) Moreover, it is arguable that Quine also adopts an implausibly strict (almost Positivist) criterion of what can count as part of the definition of mean ings etc., namely overt behaviour alone. However, if one adds verbal and internal stimuli then a defensible position may result - for a recent defence, cf. Wilder [135].) Dogma 5 (Phenomenalism) has been consistently attacked recently (see Sellars [116], Armstrong [6], Feyerabend [29]) but it seems to me that a sufficiently hard-nosed Phenomenalist could legitimately reject the arguments since they all hinge on particular characteristics of our present conceptual structure more highly than the doctrine of Phenomenalism itself (cf. my [58]). Above and beyond these detailed criticisms, there is a question of meta-consistency: the basic tenets of Empiricism (and of Conventionalism) constitute a general theory about the nature of man and his relation to the world, they seem neither reducible to 'sensation and reflection' (Empiricism), nor to conventions, if they are to make the sense their proponents require of them. Empiricism will need to show its own tenets necessary truths, or offer some transcendental deduction of them, and conventionalism make sense of its own implicit general account of language, before these doctrines achieve the coherence required of a world view. 14 The instrumentalist can hardly claim the fact that theories are used importantly to make inferences as distinctive support, the Realist agrees to that - it is the claim that they are only instruments to this end that needs support. 15 In this connection, the new work being done on a 'systems epistemology' or an 'ecology of knowledge' though often misleadingly formulated is the beginnings of a more explicit integration around the historical spiral of epistemology with social science looked for in Section 1 - see e.g. Bateson [10], Piaget [98], Wojciechowski [138], and cf. my [73]. 16 Realism is incompatible with the semantics of phenomenalistic reduction certainly, but in this case we have something more direct - the ontology of psychology taken Realistically is not compatible with the ontology of Phenomenalism, nor do the actual psychological details support the Representative Realist theory. 17 One perfectly legitimate analysis of physical theories suggests that quantum theory demands an objective revision of the laws of logic - cf. my [61]. I happen not to accept the conclusion in this case for other reasons, but I might have, had these other reasons not applied.</page><page sequence="67">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 475 For a stimulating departure from foundational epistemology in science see Feyera bend [31], cf. my [62], [63], [70]. 18 But an epistemologist with my persuasion would be inclined to take a similar view of historical theses, religious doctrines, etc. 19 Certainly for D2 anyway. If a semantical presupposition of the use of our kind of language turns out to be some very general facts concerning the world and our neuro logical structure, then the condition sets in Di may in fact partially overlap, or even overlap quite a lot, though remaining semantically distinct kinds of conditions. These distinctions ought to be refined by the further distinctions I drew in [64], p. 167. 20 There is, e.g. ontological simplicity, conceptual simplicity, simplicity of axiomati zation, simplicity of derivation of key theorems and simplicity of representation. This last includes Schaffner's notion of fitness (cf. [114]). For an introduction to the complex ities of simplicity see Rudner [111],Bunge [17], Foster and Martin [35]. On the role of regulative ideals in science see also K?rner [78], Nash [94], Toulmin [131], [132]. 21 In case anyone is so naive as to believe that metaphysics is not essentially employed in science they should reflect upon the very general principles governing specific theo retical realizations of such ontological schemes as atoms-and-the-void. Cf. my [65] and [72] and Bunge's proto-theories, Bunge [15]. Cf. also Agassi [5], Burtt [18], Koyr? [79], [80]. 22 See Section V. As to speculative metaphysics' being thought to be unrelated to the scientific enterprise I can only say that, just as in science, it is a pragmatic decision (perhaps culturally mediated) to exclude it, and like all pragmatic decisions one runs some risk of being embarrassed. One can only defend the decision on as reasonable grounds as possible (the lack of evidence for the relevance of the concepts to science etc. - none of the arguments are very strong, nor can they always even be very clearly expressed at present). Thus there remains only a small sieve where once the Positivists had thought to erect an impenetrable barrier. 23 See Popper [100], especially appendix viii, but cf. also Note 33. 24 Since I have just finished stressing the lack of a fixed first philosophy in my Realism this is the place to add that it is obviously the case that Realism as I conceive it is logically independent of Materialism - I conceive of Materialism (and its alternatives) as scientific theories to be decided on the same merits as any such theories; one only obtains some form of Materialism if one adds to Scientific Realism some thesis con cerning the exhaustiveness of say, physics. Similarly, Realism as I defend it is a far cry from the good old anthropomorphically epistemological days in philosophy when man felt sure of himself and Realists made bold claims to know the necessary structure of reality - I have no truck with this brand of apriorist metaphysics. Illustration: Given what I have said here, and about induction earlier, I could hardly opt for a 'necessary connection' doctrine of the causal relation in anything like the sense Hume attacked. Roughly speaking, I opt for a Humean-style account of causal rela tions (and of laws generally, since 'cause' is not a very important category in mathe matical science); causal laws are generalizations derivable from theories rather than from spatio-temporal relations among initial conditions, they have as their basis energy exchanges and it will always be some such basis as this that allows us to distinguish them, it is their being derivable from a theory that leads to our saying that they support counter-factual conditionals. I doubt that we are ever likely to be in the epistemological position to confirm theories that introduce non-extensional causal relations against purely extensional versions, but if we are so I should happily accept such a strengthened doctrine; in the meantime the Humean-type account looks the most acceptable.</page><page sequence="68">476 C. A. HOOKER On this approach, cf. also Braithwaite [14], Nagel [93], Hempel [51], Hanson [44]. 25 Thus despite his careful examination of the position - and the related Ramsey transcriptionism, cf. Section 6 below - and despite his referring to my [59], where I stated this argument 5 years before, Cornman still manages to miss the point; he con centrates on the question of specific defects in the approach because he takes a narrow conception of the positions involved instead of looking to their global dimensions. 26 E.g. one might want to defend only the weaker view if one thought, as I do, that it is an empirical question whether nature is a continuum with respect to any physical variable (e.g. space, time, spin etc.). Cf. [42]. Suppe [125] presents a version of this argument. 27 A not untypical empiricist move would be to lop them off the theory proper and locate them in an 'accompanying model' which acts as a heuristic device but does not enter the structure of science essentially. Cf. Nagel [92] and Sellars' nice discussion in [117]. Cf. also Suppe [125], [128]. On the roles of models in general see also Campbell [22], Harr? [46], Hesse [54], especially see her [53], Henkin et al. [52], McMullin [86], Suppes [129], [130]. 28 In respect of coherence in science, obviously a theory is incompletely internally global just to the extent that it is externally global. The ideal, totally internally global theory would encompass all of science. For those interested in the further elaboration of the structure of science outlined in this essay and extended in [71], Ron Giere has provided a nice discussion of the structure of the statistical inferences involved in an epistemological setting closely sim ilar to mine. See [39]. 29 Bunge [16], and Suppe [125], [126], have independently discussed a not dissimilar structure for science and various others have discussed fragments of it, e.g. van Fraassen [36], [37], Hempel [47], Hesse [57], Sellars [117], Shapere [120], [121], Suppes [129], [130]. (I have had the opportunity of seeing these works by Bunge and Suppe only in the interval between the writing of the penultimate and ultimate drafts of this paper.) Cf. also my remarks in [71]. 30 In this connection Maxwell has emphasized that an important part of the charac terization of the general conditions of an experiment will be the obtaining of theoret ically characterized circumstances (e.g. thermal or phase equilibrium, negligible angular momentum perturbation etc. etc.). These conditions will in fact in general be supported by the auxiliary theories (and confirmed through their data support) and by whatever supports the cet er is paribus clause - though Maxwell does not go into this detail. What Maxwell emphasizes, rightly, is the damage this realization does to any simple verifi cationist or falsificationist approach to science. See [91]. In the same paper Maxwell also makes the point that often a scientist will not know the exact hypothesis that will relate a theory 'properly' (i.e. in the fashion one intuitively expects, given the metaphysics etc., see below) to a range of experimental situations but will guess that there is such a relation and go on to test the theory on that basis, hoping that those very tests will reveal the correct relation. It is an interesting and im portant point because, though seldom made, science abounds with such moves. I would only add that what guides intuition here are the general metaphysics and proto theories operative plus the models suggested by the theory and its auxiliaries. As Maxwell remarks, this complicates the confirmation relation still further. 31 E.g. there will be calibration of instruments and determination of errors; also the transformation of readings into model-properties. This last, like the former, introduces additional theoretical assumptions, e.g. the construction of a smooth density function</page><page sequence="69">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 477 from a finite mass sample, of a velocity and location from time-of-flight measurements and so on. All of these apply equally to human sense organs as to machines. 32 Here, e.g., we must correct the system behaviour for the influence of factors ignored in the theoretical model and also make the transition to any further idealization built into the theoretical model - point masses etc. 33 Thus Hempel's deducibility conditions for explanation I take to be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions of a satisfying explanation. It further follows, I believe, that, although all sound explanations of this type will also provide sound predictions, mere prediction is a much weaker requirement, so that not all predictions that pay off need rest on a basis sufficient for providing a satisfying explanation. On the deductive model of explanation and the explanation/prediction asymmetry see, e.g., Hempel [51], Suchting [124], On the role of models in science see the references of Note 27. 34 Sometimes, for example, scientists argue after a form 'If T and E then with prob ability p (near 1) S, so assume S; now if 5...' and sometimes they argue 'if S then T, assuming T we shall also assume S: now if ?...' when predicting how things will go, as well as when assessing the degree of support a theory possesses (cf. Note 30). Of course many far more complex argument forms than this appear as well in actual prac tice. In many, many applications of a scientific theory one cannot say for certain, given the theory under examination, precisely what the experimental conditions are, though one can usually know very probably what they are. Unlike the empiricist structure, therefore, which segregates deductive and inductive arguments, the present model per mits both types of argument to occur in all theory-data transitions. 35 By 'model theoretic' I mean assertions couched in the descriptive terms of the model and not a formal metamathematical language. 36 These themes are expounded in my [65]. For some earlier intimations, see also [64], Section 13. Further Realist exposition is found in [66] and [67]. 37 I might add that, even narrowly construed within the stage 2 development of induc tion (Section 1) and hence as a specialized part of stage 3, the foregoing analysis re quires a radically re-vamped theory of confirmation. Actual falsification, equally with verification, can hardly be expected to be realized (cf. also [91], and Note 40). But confirmation itself must be seen as something considerably different from the theory of the direct data sentence - theoretical sentence moves suggested by the simple tradi tional structure to science; confirmation may eventually turn out to be a purely logical style relation, but the characteristics one wants now to give it leave this issue in doubt to say the least. First, theories are decided among, and confirmed to differing degrees by the same evidence on quite other criteria than purely deductive ones, criteria which include 'fit' with preferred metaphysics and proto theories, simplicity, fecundity etc. Second, there is in general no simple relation between a theory and either 'its' hard data or 'its' phenomenal data, transitions to each require auxiliary theories, ce ter is paribus clause, model corrections etc., and may often not even be deductive - the support or lack of it that reports formulated at either level furnish a theory is indirect and me diated by a number of considerations concerning all of these other factors (e.g. the likelihood that, given the preferred metaphysics, the ceteris paribus clause is O.K., etc.) (Moreover, the very language in which observation is reported is dominated by the relevant theories and so the reporting may be only as reliable as the theory to be re ported on - cf. also [57], p. 61.) Third, the degree of support a given experimental out come furnishes a theory is at least partially determined by that theory itself, because it supplies part or all of the theory of the instruments used ! Thus the theory specifies how accurate an instrumental reading is likely to be, whether it directly reflects the</page><page sequence="70">478 C. A. HOOKER theoretical parameter value etc. and so determines the degree of support the instrument reading yields that very same theory (cf. my [71] for details). For these reasons the simple empiricist notion of confirmation as a quasi-logical relation between data sen tences and theoretical sentences must be abandoned to be replaced by something that is closer to the actual structure of scientific reasoning - what that will be I do not know. Equally, it seems to me that by and large the goals of verification and falsification are ideals seldom, if ever, attained; they may function as regulative ideals, they can hardly act as demarcating criteria for the scientific (cf. also [91] - anyway this circumstance will hardly bother us; cf. Section 10 for remarks on methodology). 38 E.g. the belief that solid things are without interstices - it is not that we see that objects are interstice-free, it is just that we do not see any interstices. Notice that this is a different position from Sellars who so closely links concepts and beliefs that the phenomenal level must be scrapped in toto in the final analysis. Cf. my discussion in Section 6 and in my [66]. 39 E.g. it does not include the concept of a point mass, this concept can be made rigorously consistent through the theory of distributions, it does include 'line of force' because these are intended to be individuals and yet according to theory there would on occasion have to be real, irrational numbers of them. 40 One of the weaknesses in the present work of Suppe is that he does not distinguish these various cases. 41 See Maxwell [89], [90]. Ramsey's original idea was advanced in [109] and later developed especially by Bohnert [12], [13]. I have commented upon it and cited some more literature in [59] and [60]. Cf. also Cornman [25] and the more recent literature he cites. 42 The only thing we are supposed to know about the theoretical predicates is that their extensions are interrelated, and related to the extensions of observation terms, in certain ways. This suggests a further, more extreme, move : drop the explicit occur rence of bound variables ranging over properties, and pass instead to bound variables ranging over just the extensions of these unknown terms (so that predication in effect becomes membership). This extreme version remains parasitic upon the concept of a theoretical predicate, however, until such times (if ever) as a direct translational tech nique can be formulated for passing from the untranscribed theory to the purely set theoretic transcribed version in a way which avoids using some kind of comprehension axiom to define the sets and insure their regularity that would not commit one to the theoretical predicates. If this severer formulation could be made to work, however, I believe it would better capture Maxwell's quasi-empiricist structuralism, cf. below in the text. I am indebted to Nino Cocchiarella for helpful criticism at this point. 43 Cf. my discussion in [59] and that by Bohnert [12], [13]. The difficulty with the latter view is that we do not yet have any precise account of inductive argument forms and so one cannot produce a clear-cut answer as to whether devices exist to cope with them. Cf. the discussion by Cornman [25]. 44 The reasons for the unlikelihood are these: for the non-theoretical object satisfying the Ramsey claim to have only the properties which the observable level of the relevant theory admits is for that theory to be reducible to observational statements alone ? la P-Empiricism and for the properties to be observable but not so reducible is highly implausible (how did we miss them?), yet for the properties to be theoretical is certainly to re-admit a significant sense of theory, even if it is restricted to an implausible macro phenomenalist ontology. The actual structure of Ramsey transcribed sentences is considerably more complex</page><page sequence="71">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 479 than most accounts of it (including Maxwell's) suppose. For some of these complexities, see e.g. Sneed [123]. 45 Actually, in the form in which Maxwell presents the argument it is made to com prehend not only theoretical terms in the usual sense but also the ordinary first order properties of the macro world, thus arguing for some version of Lockean representative realism; but we can distinguish the two applications, resist Maxwell's extension of the argument and defend a version of direct realism if we wish. This latter course is the one I would myself argue for, indeed I see it as essential to a viable Realism, cf. above and [58], and so in my account here I shall construe this argument as applying only to theoretical terms. Note that this restriction is compatible with the Realist rejection of the observational/theoretical dichotomy in the strict empiricist sense and its replace ment by a theoretically defined distinction within psychology. 46 Though I agree with Sellars [117] that Nagel [92] does not succeed in reconciling Instrumentalism and Realism, the force of part of Sellars' attack on Nagel may be vitiated by the foregoing remarks since it is not clear that Nagel really intended it to be logically impossible for theoretical terms to 'descend' to the observational level. 47 It should surely be clear that to claim that X is actually realized and to claim that X is only physically possible (i.e. to claim that X's occurrence is merely compatible with the true, fundamental laws of physics whatever they be), is to claim distinct things, a fortiori, to claim merely that X's occurrence is compatible with the laws of logic is to make a third distinct claim. 48 These moves are as follows: First, they can make use of an observation/reporting distinction to point out that scientists are conditioned to respond to experimental situations in theoretical language just as they respond to more ordinary situations in more ordinary language, just this may account for the felt familiarity; indeed, I see no objection to the inclusion of such responses in a quasi-empiricist account of meaning ('electron' is the sort of term I use to respond to situations of... sort), in this case the term might even be said to have a connotation of sorts, though not one directly concerned with the subject matter of the theory. Second, I believe they could adopt Sellars' view that theoretical terms share higher order predicates in common with terms having a connotation (cf. [117] and Section 6.4.3. below), they might even insist on this too as a component in genuine connotations for theoretical terms. Third, they might point out that the metaphysics of a theory already specifies the kind of thing or property to which many theoretical terms are to refer, if the meta physics is granted a connotational content it could partially confer it on these terms. One could easily add to the Ramsey transcribed theory a collection of assertions giving this additional content (e.g. that the term electron stands for a class of objects such that the members in its extension share the attributes mass, motion, locality in common with billiard balls and such that it is used by scientists when responding descriptively to cloud chamber photographs), and I do believe that this would come a lot closer to grasping the content of a theory than does the unadorned Ramsey approach, but it involves introducing a meta-linguistic component to theories and to my knowledge the approach has not yet been extensively explored. Of course, to the extent that all of these sources are taken as sources of genuine connotation, to that extent the strict Ramsey analysis must be abandoned (since none of the claims that would follow analytically from the connotations thus acquired fol low from the bare Ramsey treatment). More seriously, this account is worthless until</page><page sequence="72">480 C. A. HOOKER it is specified how ordinary language and the terms of the metaphysics (if distinct) acquire their connotations. If the answer is: through observation, then the latter be comes impossible to understand (how could a metaphysics possibly be rich enough to specify a general world ontology for a variety of theories if its terms are confined to observational content? - unless it is done purely denotationally, in which case this treatment for theories themselves will surely be sufficient) and the former leads us back into the dogmas of Empiricism (not to mention the lack of an account of how attribute sharing can enrich the language beyond the original observational resources, cf. 6.4.3. below). But if the source of connotation is mysterious we have failed to advance at all. On the other hand, the 'pure Ramseyite' might simply wish to insist that all of these sources contribute not to genuine connotations for theoretical terms, but to psycho logical states in scientists in which they feel the normal familiarity with the terms. (Here observation as the source of connotation may be safely retained.) This move requires an analysis of the distinction between meanings and the psychology of language use that supports this possibility. I find it less attractive because I am persuaded that the foregoing sources belong to a proper account of the meanings of theories, I also find the difficulties of the alternative unappealing; but until this approach is explored and found decisively wanting it seems a consistent way out. 49 In the former case, the history of such 'terms' as molecule, gene etc. which, we would normally say, once referred to unobservable entities that are now - thanks to modern instrumental technology - observable, poses more problems for this position. The only consistent answer is to deny that, in some strict sense, these entities are observable even to-day. We shall see later that this might be done, without falling into the trap of es pousing a phenomenalist analysis of sensory experience, but the Realist here is forced to tip toe along a razor edge between disasters. (The modified Ramsey approach seems distinctly preferable on this score anyway.) 50 Indeed, the notion of ostensive definition is quite compatible with some formula for meanings of words in terms of the set of rules governing their usages, since the osten sivist can claim either that a sensorially handicapped person could not understand the meaning of all of the rules associated with an ostensively defined term (i.e. could not understand a rule of the form 'Apply this predicate when you are in these circumstances', circumstances demonstratively indicated) and/or would not be able to apply all the rules successfully. It is important to understand all of the logically possible combina tions of doctrines here in order to appreciate the reasonable room to manoeuvre which the Realist has. In fact, a form of the two arguments used earlier to support this alternative can be employed here to argue for the necessity of ostensive definition. To quote Mary Hesse: ... there must be a stock of predicates in any descriptive language for which it is impossible to specify necessary and sufficient conditions of correct application. For if any such specification could be given for a particular predicate, it would introduce further predicates requiring to be learned in empirical situations for which there was no specification... We must, there fore, conclude that the primary process of recognition... is necessarily un verbalizable. The emphasis here of course is on primary, because it may be perfectly possible to give empirical descriptions of the conditions, both psychological and physical, ... but such descriptions will themselves depend on further undescribable primary recognitions. (Hesse, pp. 39-40, author's italics.)</page><page sequence="73">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 481 (Those who would deny the hierarchy of analysis appealed to here and envision instead a language in which, circularly, every predicate would have its conditions of application described in the language, only succeed in 'smearing' the ostensive support throughout the language, not in dissipating it - cf. Note 13.) 51 For Feyerabend's doctrines see, eg., [27], [28], [32], - for a more complete biblio graphy together with a critical review see my [63], and for specific critical comments see, e.g., Achinstein [2], Butts [19], Putnam [104], Sellars [117], and my [70]. 52 The only other possibility, that theories have their semantic content conferred from some external source, does not seem open to Feyerabend, for there are only alternative, and hence semantically incompatible, theories that could act as this source, or else it is completely mysterious - the level of neurophysiological irritation is common to all theories and hence of no use here. Feyerabend certainly does not discuss the possibility of an external source and the structure of his philosophy suggests that he would dis count it. 53 Roughly, Beth defines a k-ary predicate K(xi, ...Xk) to be explicitly defined relatively to a set of formulas A and the predicates they contain besides K if there is a formula U containing k free variables and other predicate letters from A such that (Xl) ...(XJc) (K(X1, ...,Xk)&lt;~* U(Xl,..., XJc)) is entailed by A, and implicitly defined if (xi)...(xk) (K(xi,..., xic)&lt;r-*K'(xi,..., Xk)) is entailed by A U B, where B is obtained from A by replacing each occurrence of K by some other &amp;-ary predicate K' which does not appear in A. See Beth [11], p. 290. I have van Fraassen to thank for reminding me of the importance of this theorem. 54 To take a hopelessly trivial case, if in the postulate (x) (Ax =&gt; Bx) the concept of an A is that of membership in a set of things which include the set of J5's as a subset then this postulate is already an effective tautology and it becomes so twice over if the con cept of a B is that of a set of objects included in the set of A's. 55 Not that the former would automatically rule out the position - given Feyerabend's assumptions it seems to me that a case could probably be made out for the view that a bunch of tautologies could act as an effective guide to life. After all, they only have to be so related to conditioned behavioural respones that people survive, continue ex perimenting etc. and such relations do not seem ruled out by the tautological character of the beliefs. Cf. on this score the functioning of a myth - see e.g. Feyerabend's com ments in [31]. Those who automatically assume that tautologies cannot be a guide to life either tacitly assume an empiricist account on which tautologies are both restricted to logic and uninformative and/or assume that only by conscious assent to the cogni tive content of a belief, as making a difference to prediction, do beliefs affect conduct, but this ignores the subtleties of the conditioning role of language. Nonetheless no one, to my knowledge, has tried to grasp and develop this interesting thorn in detail and so I too shall leave it resting on its rose vine with only this brief defence. On implicit definition see also the excellent discussions by Frege [38], Hempel [50], Nagel [92]. Cf. my discussion in [70] and Lewis [84]. 56 But Sellars concedes that for Feyerabend the only interesting feature of theories is their direct connection to sensory responses, Feyerabend ignores this independently described subject matter in all cases, so he is able to construe natural language as a theory, in his sense - [117], pp. 172-4. 57 See [117] pp. 178-184 and the references cited there. At a crude level of approxima tion the complex relations holding between theory and the common sense framework which are mediated via the models may be viewed as the traditional correspondence</page><page sequence="74">482 C. A. HOOKER rules; cf. the theory-phenomenal correspondence rules in my structural model in Sec tion V above. 58 Certainly there are some features which strike one as immediately right about this sort of account. Pretty clearly our ancestors developed language initially as stimuli to action and these sounds, laboriously built into a systematic pattern, can be supposed to have been thoroughly behaviourally oriented. But the actual developmental his tory is a bit hazy, and insight is not assisted by the fact that we know of only 'completed' languages (i.e. languages we can map onto our full-blown commonsense framework). Specifically, Sellars does still rely quite heavily on analogical enrichment of the obser vation-to-theory part to get us up-hill from a purely observational base-only the invalid ity of construing an analogical relation as a logical one saves Sellars from the empiricist semantical dogma (i.e. dogma 2, that all descriptive terms are analyzable in terms of pure observational terms). But then what exactly happens to semantic content during such analogical shifts, how it is transformed, how the mind has the capacity to carry out this operation, and how we achieve a 'leap' to richer concepts remain something of a mystery. And there are more specific difficulties as well. (See here the exchange between Marras and Sellars [87], [119], [88], which it seems to me Marras has won - at least at this stage of the debate.) Moreover, there is in Sellars still the old empiricist insistence that observation brings something special to concepts. For the additional semantical richness by which theore tical terms attain to full stature is just their use in observation once again. In addition, I cannot see why observation (or its internal equivalents) in the common sense con ceptual scheme are held to confer a special, irreplaceable semantic content as Sellars seems to believe. (See the detail argument in my [58].) Note that my attitude does not entail the rejection of the notion of ostensive definition. 59 The ideas in Sections 6.6.2.-6.6.3.6. are expounded in [66]. 60 Not all of them do because the common sense framework itself is shot through with theories, cf. below and [66] e.g. 61 Thus ask a scientist 'what is that?' pointing to an object, and he, assuming a tech nical question may reply 'It is a Wilson cloud chamber' ; but if you then say 'are you sure?' in a fashion which suggests not merely technical ambiguity but the possibility of a more radical error, he will immediately return towards his perceptually active con cepts, he might say e.g. 'Well it looks like a cloud chamber, there's the cylinder for the plunger and here the counter array...' - the harder he is pressed the further towards purity in the use of these concepts he will be driven. 62 Both Popper and Feyerabend recognize elements of the psychology of perception which backs this distinction, though without putting that theory to work in the phi losophy of science very pointedly, cf. [30] and [101]. Hesse [57] recently discussed the continuum of epistemological caution within science without introducing the psy chology of perception; otherwise, much of her commentary makes excellent sense. Schaffner [114], pp. 323-4, comes close to this distinction (he draws a distinction nearly that of my Co, C concepts distinction in [66], though he makes it theory-conflict re lative) but smothers it with semantical restrictions (e.g. that there are no experimentally gratuitous conceptual distinctions) and a narrow view of it determined by its alleged history. This distinction is properly encompassed within an analysis of 'seeing that' (rather than 'seeing X') which, as I say, I have offered in detail elsewhere [58]. Suppe [125], e.g. is correct in sensing the importance of such an analysis for the general philosophy of science, but fails, as do most of his colleagues, to take the psychology of percep</page><page sequence="75">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 483 tion seriously enough and so misses the actively-observing/reporting distinction. 63 The fact is then that the psychology of perception is not taken seriously enough when discussing the notion of observation in science. If to this lacuna we add the view that the connotations of terms are pragmatically determined, i.e. determined by their uses to which their users have been socially conditioned, then we indeed collapse the distinction between reporting and the actively observational. This is just how Feyera bend et al. seem to have overlooked the distinction. But note that even with the prag matic determination of connotation granted, the distinction remains once an adequate psychology of perception is introduced. 64 The distinction is also not much discussed in philosophy proper, i.e. within the philosophy of perception in epistemology, which is, I intuit, the reason for the blindness in philosophy of science. Philosophical doctrines of perception have tended to operate within the confines of the empiricist-phenomenalist analysis of perception where per ceptual reports were simply exact descriptions of some conceptualized content, a sense datum; there was an assumed identity of content and report. But in fact perception is neuro-physiologically and linguistically much more complex (and interesting) than this. What we report of perception, as indeed the content of our perceptions, are func tions of the cortical processing undertaken. Nor are the linguistic reportage and per ceptual processings totally tied together (indeed, it is almost certainly not the case that all conscious perception is linguistically conceptualized - cf. my [74], [58]). What I have in mind here is the interpretation of experiments on people whose right and left brain lobe connections have been severed. See [93]. Since only one lobe possesses linguistic ability and yet both lobes respond as though fully conscious, what are we to say? It seems plausible to say that so long as neurophysiological processing is rich enough to provide all the usual perceptual information (as evidenced by behavioural skills etc.) then, in effect, the usual perceptually active concepts are active here as well; but there is no correlative linguistic ability. In any case, this view seems reasonable just on the ground that the information processing view of the brain seems likely to prove the most adequate one and the possession of concepts is most plausibly tied to the possession of information-pro cessing cortical structures; moreover we know that in a normal brain the localized speech centre is only a small portion of one lobe. What this suggests is that perceptual skills and, if we accept the argument of the preceding paragraph, conceptual skills are much broader than linguistic skills. Indeed, if we could only rid ourselves of the supersti tion that thinking and seeing were kinds of internal linguistic acts we should be well on the road towards saying something sensible about non-cognitive communication, artistic creativity, supra-linguistic mathematical activity (and symbolic activity in gen eral...) and even 'being stuck for words'. For further elaboration see my [74]. 65 It would take a long argument to extend this claim to other cultures as well, but this I would want to do by emphasizing three points: (i) to possess a concept is funda mentally to possess an information-processing structure in the cortex, hence concepts are expected to be determined by experience and to be richer than language - cf. Note 64, (ii) what language skills a culture develops depends upon its social interests etc., i.e. it is a partly pragmatic affair, (iii) at best one might expect some conceptual-per ceptual schemes to be fragments of others, not incompatible with others, for there is no evidence of massive illusion in any culture. Using these moves I would attempt to render the anthropological work on other cultures - e.g. that by Whorf [134] on the Hopi - compatible with the claim in the text. 66 E.g. the Oxford English Dictionary defines solid as (i) impenetrable etc. and (ii)</page><page sequence="76">484 C. A. HOOKER completely filled up etc. Pretty clearly semantic component (ii) began life as a primitive, perhaps unconscious, but anyway false, attempt to explain (i). 67 I can conceive of a world in which science reached the conclusion that unaided man was under systematic illusion in every respect (that science was possible would depend upon the pattern of the illusion), though I do not believe it probable. 68 This holds as true of the esot?rica of quantum theory and general relativity as of general atomic theory. Unless geometry were locally euclidean, unless macro scale col lectivities of micro entities do not fluctuate in state over perceptible time intervals, etc. we could not plausibly explain our macro-world. There is here no fault with the guarded macro observation reports I have delineated (though some theoretical additions to these have to go). 69 We have to remember that the perceiving of secondary qualities as exemplified by objects is deeply ingrained in our evolutionary structure for obvious good reasons, it represents a quasi-theoretical commitment (Section 6.6.3.4.) rather than a theoretical one. For a detailed treatment see [58]. Though even within the common sense frame work there are reasons to believe that objects do not literally exemplify the secondary qualities Cthe strongest reverse case is that of sight with the other senses in varying degrees less bothersome in this respect), I believe we must concede that on any occasion on which we literally attribute secondary qualities to objects that we do so falsely and our corresponding perceivings are illusory. Sellars places heavy emphasis upon the secondary quality aspects of the common sense conceptual scheme and suggests that to modify them in the fashion I suggest is to abandon the scheme. I do not believe this is necessary. (The concept of, and conditions of, illusion can themselves be discussed in common sense terms, nor are qualities neces sary, cf. [58], [69].) 70 Thus the earlier arguments for ostensive definition (Section 6.4.) must not be under stood as claiming that certain terms, those ostensively defined, must be understood before any others can be understood - this is clearly impossible in most cases. (Some elementary terms, e.g. 'Dad', might be understood prior to the emergence of some fragment of a conceptual scheme.) Rather a conceptual scheme emerges slowly in a child's head with many terms taking on clearer 'definition' - cf. Note 63. In this sense the 'smeared' model of ostensive support is very probably the more accurate. 71 These particular dimensions to common language give the final sense in which Feyerabend is right to hold that common sense language embodies a theory, though in this case it is less than certain that it embodies a false theory. For an elaboration of this doctrine see my [70]. 72 If it could be shown experimentally that the elaboration of the untheoretical core was at the behest of contemporary theories, rather than general features of the macro structure of the world, then my position would become indistinguishable from a (rather 'wild') version of radical anti-Empiricism. If we discovered that the elaboration of this core was influenced by theories held at historically earlier times then we should no longer have a coherent account of how science was possible, though if we discovered (more plausibly) that the common sense linguistic scheme was progressively infected by byegone theories then we should have one more reason to distinguish concepts in general from linguistic concepts and to distrust the linguistic semantical dimension. 73 It is necessary to keep these points clearly in mind, otherwise one will be tempted to run backward along the line of evolutionary advance searching for a purer and purer realm of untheoretical concepts. This search is chimerical, for as we regress the un</page><page sequence="77">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 485 theoretical conceptual scheme becomes cruder and more fragmentary, far enough back we run out of concepts altogether. 74 Indeed, to quote Mary Hesse: ...the comparatively stable area within which it is proposed to define an observation language itself is partly known to us because its stability is explained by the theories we now accept. It is certainly not sufficiently defined by investigating what observation statements have in fact remained stable during long periods of time, for this stability might be due to accident, prejudice, or false beliefs. Thus any attempted definition itself would rely upon current theories and, hence, not be a definition of an observation language which is theory-independent. Indeed, it might justly be concluded that we shall know what the most adequate observation language is only when if possible we have true and complete theories, including theories of physiology and physics which tell us what it is that is most 'directly ob served'. ([57], p. 49.) The difference between Hesse and I is that she thinks that this truth renders the un theoretical/theoretical distinction insignificant for science whereas I do not, for the reason given. She also thinks that it leads irresistably to the 'network model', whereas I do not - cf. below. 75 The idea that there might be no hard and fast observational vocabulary for science is not a new one. When discussing one particular realization of this idea - the so-called 'network' model of theories - Mary Hesse offers two pages of references in fine print to others in which this idea, or fragments or analogues of it, may be found, beginning with Duhem and Campbell, though it is clear that earlier work in the nineteenth century already contained the issue ([20], [22], [26], [133], [136], for Hesse's bibliography see [57], footnote 4). And Schaffner derives his views on a model similar to my own from Popper. Nonetheless many of these accounts (though by no means all) suffer because they discuss the issue in isolation from a psychology of perception and concept forma tion. The network theory is a case in point. The position which I have tried to develop attempts to self-consciously take into account these domains of psychological theory - in particular, I believe that any realistic view of the function of observational vocabu lary in science must draw a distinction between the reporting and perceiving roles and link that distinction to the distinction between perceptually active concepts and those not so, further that the relative stability of the common sense observational vocabulary must be explained in terms of this former category of concepts. The network theory removes certain semantical problems by declaring them chimerical but seems to ignore psychological structures behind theorizing (it ignores the distinctions I have drawn). The reason for this is that the passage is made too hurriedly from the denial of the analytic/synthetic distinction, via the network model, to the denial of the observational/ theoretical dichotomy (observation sentences are simply those 'on the periphery'). I will not dispute that the denial of the analytic/synthetic distinction leads to the network model but one only moves from thence to the denial of any epistemologically signifi cant observational/theoretical dichotomy if one also tacitly assumes that the psychol ogy of perception is either irrelevant to this issue or supports the pragmatic theory of observation terms - I hold this tacit premise false. (This argument shows that the re jection of the analytic/synthetic distinction is not sufficient for the rejection of the observational/theoretical dichotomy; pretty clearly it is not necessary either. It follows that its rejection is not sufficient for Realism, and I believe not necessary either, at</page><page sequence="78">486 C. A. HOOKER least for the quasi-empiricist forms.) However, Hesse and Schaffner do in fact come quite close to my position, Hesse when she concedes that as a matter of fact some predi cates are more stably observable than are others (cf. [57], pp. 50-1), and Schaffner when he allows that one may 'analyze back' observation statements to increasingly 'deeper' levels, until a level of agreement in meaning between conflicting theories is found- [114], pp. 321-2. (Hesse also makes nicely clear that the network model, though it encourages talk of convention, is quite distinct from conventionalism; [57], p. 43.) 76 The cortex is capable of a tremendously complex range of activities, there is every reason not to hold it down to some simple combining operations on preformed con cepts (as e.g. empiricists would have us do). If to possess a concept is to possess a cortical processing structure of some sort then we can expect there to be a myriad of ways in which these can be built up, ways which quite transcend our attempts at se mantic description. How, after all, did we come by our 'natural' language? Will some thing like Sellars' Rylean account do? What was the exact relationship between the psycho-cortical and social processes at work and the emerging semantic content? The semantic description seems to be relevant, so to speak, only to the relatively definite recognizable linguistic end-products which result from these fantastically complex pro cesses. It seems impossible that every psycho-cortical or social act occurring in the language-acquisition process has a semantical correlate (especially when we recall the non-linguistic powers of the cortex - cf. Note 64) ; we recognize semantically relevant features of language only after a sufficiently rich and definite linguistic framework has developed. It is when I think thus that I can believe that Quine was right to suggest that there was something inherently groundless or chimerical about meanings (i.e. conno tations), though only in this sense, cf. [107]. (Note that the foregoing is a small part of the response to the arguments for quasi-Empiricism presented in Section 5.2.) 77 It might be helpful at this stage to briefly present the view of the nature and role of observation concepts in science as I see it in order to distinguish it from both Em piricism and more radical Realisms. After the fashion of the Empiricisms I admit to the occurrence of relatively theory independent observational descriptive concepts. I have tried to say why I believe this to be the most reasonable alternative. But the empiricist produces his observational realm as a matter of a priori analysis; which concepts are observational is fixed a priori and hence permanently, consequently the observational/theoretical dichotomy is also fixed a priori and so permanently. By contrast my doctrine grows out of experience together with a psychological doctrine of perception - which concepts are observational, even in the theory-neutral case, is deter mined by the facts of our world, including our neurological make-up, and is in principle open to change as those parameters are varied; for this very reason the observational/ theoretical dichotomy is itself a theoretical distinction. Precisely for this reason it is not, as Feyerabend would have [30], a completely pragmatically determined distinction. Nor is the distinction theoretically dependent in the sense that its application in the domain of some theory is dependent on that theory as Hesse suggests ([57], p. 49) unless perhaps for the theory of neurophysiological evolution itself and like theory. Both of these further claims ignore the observational/reporting distinctions (these further claims are true of terms that have acquired a reporting role). (Hesse offers us the ex ample of the concept 'is simultaneous with' to demonstrate her case, claiming that what would be regarded as a retreat to a more cautious level by relativity theory would be regarded in the reverse light by pre-relativity classical theory. I find the example unconvincing on her own terms. But further than this note that both theories agree on</page><page sequence="79">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 487 the invariance of simultaneity at the same place among all observers. It is plausible to maintain that this, and not the extended notion of distant simultaneity, belongs to the untheoretical level. That common people may have thought otherwise is as irrelevant, in itself, here as for the case of 'solid'.) The empiricists hold observational reports to be indubitable, I emphatically do not, but hold them open to theoretically directed criticism. How this can come about is ob vious in the case of those terms that have only pragmatically acquired a reporting role at the behest of theory. Even in the case of untheoretical terms, however, we have to allow that theory is capable of showing these claims to be false and the corresponding perceptions illusory (e.g. the perception of continuity for macro objects and its semantic enshrinement in the concept 'solid') precisely by explaining how the illusions occur. For Empiricism the category of observation terms is a single one with no large-scale epistemic divisions within it. This is equally true of more radical Realisms. I distinguish sharply the untheoretical level from the theory-laden reporting level within the category of observation terms. Empiricism holds that all observation terms are theory-free and hence theory neutral or independent. Radical Realisms hold that all observation terms are theory-laden and hence not theory neutral. I hold that the terms of the untheoretical level are neutral vis-?-vis scientific theories, though with a theory-like dimension, but that the terms that have acquired an observational reporting role are theory laden. Semantically, observation terms ground, or actually exhaust, theoretical terms ac cording to Empiricism. The reverse is the case for terms that have acquired a reporting role in observation according to my doctrine. Moreover, the degree to which untheo retical terms contribute to the semantics of theories is probably small, though the matter seems obscure at this time (cf. Section 6.6.4.). For the foregoing reasons theoretical terms can never genuinely usurp the role of observation terms in Empiricism, for me this is a genuine possibility, though it might require considerably different conditions from those now obtaining. In a secondary sense it has already occurred in the introduction of terms with a reporting role. For according to my doctrine the observation reports couched in untheoretical terms have little significance for science, their only value is that they are needed to supply part of the instructions for introducing theory-laden terms that are to acquire a re porting role in observation. This is quite the opposite of the empiricist role for these terms. For Empiricism these terms play the central role required in a foundational epistemology, but I espouse a foundationless epistemology. Because of the foregoing, the macio level of common sense observables is the primary level for Empiricism - in most versions of the doctrine it is the only level. In my case it is the ontology specified by our best theory that constitutes the primary level and the macro level is to be understood in terms of it. Nonetheless, unlike many other Realisms, I do not reject the macro level in tow, for I regard the common sense conceptual frame work that forms the basis of the untheoretical level as more adequate than not and that the perceptual-conceptual discrepancies can be corrected for through an adequate theory of illusion (perception) and suitable pruning of tacit theoretical commitments (conception). Finally, I want to add a word about the notion of ostensive definition. (It can, of course, be called definition in some extended sense of that term.) I have already argued in a general way for its retention (Section 6.4.1.), now I want to explicitly retain it in a limited form. There seems little doubt that some concepts are particularly closely con nected to specific experiences and derive their linguistic function, at least in significant</page><page sequence="80">488 C. A. HOOKER part, from this connection. I do not want to say that such concepts have a unique kind of semantical status, much less that their meaning is the content of the experience. The meanings of such concepts are to be spelled out in terms of their total linguistic role (or whatever), just as for any other term, but in their case the criterion of their applica tion will be fundamentally tied to the (potential) occurrence of the experience and no explicit definition for them may be possible - only in this sense are these terms se mantically segregable. (Notice too that there is nothing to prevent the experience from being identified in alternative ways.) In this sense I find many terms of the commonsense vocabulary ostensively definable (and, if the argument of Section 6.4.1. is to be believed, necessarily so). These, and my earlier comments on ostensive definitions - see Note 50 - undermine Aune's claim that if all concepts were to be reducible to ostensively de finable ones then one could not avoid behaviourism as a theory of the human per sonality, see [8]. 78 Despite this general philosophical dispute with Graves, and despite other more tech nical criticisms I would make of his account of relativity not pertinent here, I consider Graves' book specially valuable because it belongs to a rare class of works that attempt technically competant, yet philosophically sensitive, expositions of a scientific theory. These days this occurs all too rarely. Yet I believe that in a truly mature and 'alive' intellectual community all theories would be given such a treatment. 79 There are ways in which P and Q might be challenged, but they are of no relevance here. One might e.g. argue that quantum objects are wave packets and interfering wave packets defeat P, but we are discussing compositional relations between levels here - the table and the corresponding atoms are not interfering with one another. Similarly we might speculate on 5 or more dimensional manifolds for the world structure, but here we are talking about 'parallel' 4-dimensional worlds. 80 He offers a fourth, namely that it is terribly difficult in fact to relate some theoretical levels - but this establishes nothing except the youthfulness and probably error of exist ing science. 81 The first argument is that there may be truths at some level that any reasonable re ductive mapping would have to transform into falsehoods at other levels. E.g. 'tables contain no interstices' is a statement generally conceded to be true at the common sense level but false at the atomic level (cf. pp. 16-20). The second argument is that ... the coordination [between levels A and B] is not carried out on a piece meal basis, with parts of A identified with the 'corresponding'parts ofB in succession. For an adequate explanation of even a small part of A may in fact require up to the whole of B;... (p. 24) and the third that ... conversely, two phenomena which are quite distinct in A may appeal to the same parts or aspects of B. (p. 24) I shall consider these arguments in order. The first argument is unconvincing on two grounds. First, I do not believe that we should accept common sense claims so uncritically; a statement which is true for this level is 'we do not in general see any interstices in tables' and this claim is well ex plained by the radiation pattern at the atomic level which indeed is continuous in the relevant sense. People are constantly claiming too much for their experience, but that is no reason to burden science with it. Second, even should we find a discrepancy of this kind we could not so easily avoid, I believe that it is intellectually preferrable to write it off as mere appearance (i.e. as illusion) than to adopt Graves' alternatives - always</page><page sequence="81">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 489 assuming that an explanation of the occurrence of the illusion will be forthcoming at the more fundamental level. Only in the severest circumstances does one counsel radical courses of action such as dropping P or Q. The second argument, and the third, are also such that if they were sound they would indeed constitute grounds for radical change. Unfortunately, I can find no explicit example for the second argument in Graves, but this does not prevent a sketch of the general error on which all such examples are surely based. Consider the phenomenon of the rotation of spiral galaxies, and the specific shape and rotation of our own in particular. Suppose that one wanted an explanation of this phenomenon at the atomic level and suppose that something like Mach's hypothesis were true (i.e. that inertia is a function of all masses in the universe). Then the explanation of this phenomenon would demand reference to all the entities of the atomic level, namely to all the atoms. It is the plausibility of claims such as these concerning the explanation of phenomena that lends plausibility to the argument. But the latter plausibility is spurious. The ar gument is concerned with the ontological distinctness of levels ; which entities are in volved in explanations establishes nothing concerning ontic distinctness, even where reductions involving many entities of one level may be needed in the explanation of phenomena initially described at the other (simply because many entities at one level may be involved in the explanation of phenomena described at that very same level and concerning only a subset of these entities)). Our galaxy may still be identical with a local collection of atoms, though all atoms appear in an explanation of its shape and rotation. The appropriate version of the argument reads: where we have a subset of the entities at one level that would have to be identified with the entire other level under any reasonable reduction, then no reductive identification of the two levels is possible. I would accept the argument but know of no plausible example of the premise. Only by sliding between a plausible, but irrelevant, claim and an implausible, though rele vant, claim does Graves make this argument sound plausible. The same 'sleight of mind' is used to bolster the third argument, and here Graves offers us an example. The example is that of pp. 21-4, it runs as follows: 'A table corre sponds to a swarm of molecules, a chair also corresponds to a swarm of molecules, hence at the molecular level tables and chairs are indistinguishable'. The general argu ment is: 'Ontologically distinct things at level A are indistinguishable at level B, so levels A and B are distinct'. Of course tables and chairs are not merely swarms of mole cules but structured lattices of molecules and the structures may be as readily dis tinguished at the molecular, as at the common sense, level. Indeed, macro objects are structured, located lattices of molecules, so that even 'indistinguishable' macro objects can be readily distinguished at the micro level. Graves has faked the argument by a deliberate omission of specificity in the premise. Of course, their molecular structures do not distinguish tables and chairs qua socially functioning objects, but then neither do their macro physical descriptions which is all that is of relevance here (a second sleight of mind in this argument perhaps?). I know of no other plausible example for Graves' argument. Finally, Graves might try to hold R false, or perhaps meaningless, on the grounds of incommensurability of theories. (R is an inter-theoretic claim.) I at least would reject this tack, and so, it seems, would Graves (cf. p. 24). 82 The idea was to decide upon an optimal course of action that would increase the known facts maximally rapidly and lead by the shortest route to succeeding increasingly general theories, given the existing facts and theories. Roughly speaking this is equiv alent to solving the problem of induction. For if there is a 'prospective methodology'</page><page sequence="82">490 C. A. HOOKER (cf. my [63]) of discovery which works purely with a data-theory base and churns out, by some algorithm, the next best theory and correlative data then it must also thereby identify the best justified theory given the new data base, and conversely, if we have a 'retrospective methodology' of justification that selects the best theory, given a data theory base, then it will select the next best theory in advance given a data-theory base (or, if an existing theory is continually selected, either science has reached its denoue ment or method becomes blind and one must simply accumulate facts at random). This narrow construal of methodology is of course only possible against the 'logical machine' view of science, for here scientists have been entirely lost sight of. We ignore the fact that it is a course of action for a scientist that is specified, rather methodology is here viewed as providing an algorithm for quasi-logical transitions in science. 83 Hanson by attempting to widen 'the existing circumstances' to include a variety of other modes of reasoning than those admitted by Empiricism. See [44]. Occasionally Hanson crosses from the quasi-formal into the purely psychological, thereby aban doning his tacit acceptance of the general empiricist account of science. In general though he seems content merely to enlarge the notion of formal reasoning with which Empiricism operated, and the correlative notion of perception with it. Feyerabend argues this both by attempting to reduce to absurdity the empiricist methodology and by arguing that 'the existing circumstances' must be enlarged to in clude all of the circumstances of an individual's life. 84 Taken thus far, there is no necessity to assert e.g. that theory can only be defeated via confrontation with another theory (pace Smart) ; whether one holds this latter claim inflexibly or not depends to a large extent on one's analysis of the relations of 'fact' to theory. If one believed, as Feyerabend seems to, that the semantics of the observation language is determined by the theory for which it is the observation language then the condition seems at once both necessary and impossible to understand; for on the one hand each theory generates its own realm of 'facts' on this account and so if one is to know of the empirical alternatives at all one must first know of the theory, and yet on the other hand since the 'facts' of one theory are semantically incommensurate with those of the other there seems no way in which to make the direct comparison that empirical judgment between them requires. (Feyerabend's critics have been quick to point this out, cf. Achinstein [3], Butts [19], Fine [34]; cf. Hesse [55], Hesse [57], Hull [76]). Feyerabend's view, however, was never so consistently, or so simply, drawn. For one thing he recognizes the conditioned aspect of typical observation reports (this is his Pragmatic Theory of Observation - cf. [30]); unfortunately he fails to take the hint from Popper's use of the psychology of perception (as Popper himself fails - cf. [101]) and distinguish hard data from phenomenal reports. Nonetheless Feyerabend is on the right track when he says that the level common to two theories is the level of non verbal responses to stimuli (cf. the clashes between conditioned expectations expressable at the hard data and phenomenal levels of experience), it is just that without the psychological and epistemological apparatus erected earlier one has no way to clearly understand or developed this intuition. 85 The changes that have occurred in the history of science have been quite radical, even to the ditching of entire ontologies and rafts of 'facts' = hard data. Only by re ducing the theoretical dimension to near zero can the empiricist make this history look like a steady accumulation of data. On the other hand, the role of controversy in science is of great importance and it is implausible to insist that that controversy always amounts to no more than propa ganda, rather than the serious debate of the comparative merits of different points of</page><page sequence="83">SYSTEMATIC REALISM 491 view. Furthermore there is considerable evidence for a continuity of progression and the preservation of fundamental theoretical ideas over the course of science which cannot be ignored in any plausible account. 86 Feyerabend at least cannot be said to be guilty of lack of historical sensitivity. Indeed, he claims to arrive at his position through historical analysis. Actually, this is only partly true, his semantical prescriptions, and to a large extent his correlative theory of observation are still formulated within the aprioristic mold. 87 This aspect of the history of science, of the relative unimportance of mere raw ob servational evidence and the relevant importance of how the theory dictates what should be done with it has been nicely stressed by Feyerabend and too often ignored by every one else. 88 Little enough has been explicitly written recently about systematic metaphysics and its relation to science after the fashion of my [72] and [65], though I view this as an urgent necessity. Many of the earlier writings on this subject, in my view, fall far short of the desired perceptiveness and system. Representative among earlier writings are Burtt [18], Koyr? [79], [80], Pap [96], Toulmin and Goodfield [132]. 89 E.g. classical logical structure, and various dynamical structures, for example the canonical dynamical formalism, various group theoretic structures and so on - although not all of these mathematical structures are shared by all scientific theories and in some cases they have been 'generalized' in a fairly obvious sense. Cf. my [65]. 90 The former usually linked to the metaphysical-mathematical continuity level - e.g. Einstein's remarks on the equivalence of inertia and gravitational mass - and the latter connected to the elementary observational level. 91 If a culture presses a particular descriptive scheme and its correlative ontology over a long period of time (e.g. many centuries), constructing within its confines many dif ferent successive theories, each one designed to cope more adequately with those areas of experimental experience where the former theories ran into difficulty, and if at the end of such a long process these difficulties were not clarified but seemed only to deepen in their embeddedness in the fundamental theoretical structure, then it may force that culture to a re-evaluation of its fundamental descriptive scheme and ontology and to seek to create alternatives to it. As a matter of fact, I believe that we in western so ciety are precisely in this position in the 20th Century where the two great conceptual schemes mentioned above have twice met - leading to the creation of relativity theory and quantum theory respectively - and the difficulties involved in the use of those two schemes, and especially in the attempt to combine them,we are now discovering, sug gests that very fundamental revisions in the basic structure of our description of the world are required (cf. [64]). Under these circumstances we may well be forced and encouraged to look around for alternatives to these two schemes. If such be the case then we may wish to withdraw the word metaphysics from any part of the content of science, withholding the term only for the strictly uncriticizable, but this is really a matter of little importance and it is a useful term to draw attention to the perhaps, but only perhaps !, culturally invariant content of part of our science.
