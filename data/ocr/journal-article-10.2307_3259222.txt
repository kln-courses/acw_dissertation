Professor MacDonald's study of the philosophical ideas contained in the Old Testament really supports two theses, first, that the "widely prevalent dogma that the Hebrews had no philosophy" is false; second, that Christian trinitari- anism is developed historically out of the Hebraic duality of Jehovah and Reason (p. 146 f.). Professor MacDonald does not tell us what the supporters of the widely prevalent dogma mean by "philosophy," so that it is impossible to decide upon the evidence of his book whether he has disproved their thesis or not. He himself gives us no definition of this highly ambiguous term, but by his use of it he seems to mean that a person is philosophical if he relies upon his "reason" as well as his faith in regard to his religious beliefs. To use one's reason, it is suggested (p. 2), is to go beyond revelation and authority to a more personal kind of insight. But whether this kind of insight was rational as mathematics is, or rational as an empirical science is, our author does not tell us. And since he refers to mystical contact with God, expressed in some of the Psalms, as also typical of the Hebrews, it is difficult to decide (a) just what the non- revelatory and non-authoritarian source of knowledge was and (b) what the Hebrews themselves thought about it in theory as well as what they did with it in practice. Later on a more curious notion of "philosophy" appears. Dis- cussing the twenty-eighth chapter of Job, MacDonald says (p. 42), "The poem thus denies that man can reach philosophy, but such a denial means that the poet has already reached philosophy." It means this, of course, only if the poet were expressing a rational scepticism and not simply a poetic despair of reaching rational solutions of certain problems. A schoolboy who impatiently tosses aside his algebra book, crying out that the problem cannot be done, does not "mean" in his cry any philosophy whatsoever, though philosophers who argue by what they are likely to call "dialectic"--that is by reading their own habitual meanings into other people's words and even acts--can find a philosophy in almost anything. The main tenet of Hebraic philosophy was belief in a God Who was a person as human beings are persons, anthropomorphic, not infallible, with Whom there might be mystic intercourse (p. 3). Besides this the Hebrews believed in free-will which was man's differentia (p. 12); in a world which was so completely in a state of flux that even God was not beyond change (p. 17); "repenting Himself" of this or that; in the ultimacy of " Life," implying man's mortality (p. 20); and in the identity of evil and stupidity (p. 25). Yet when one reads this account,</page><page sequence="2">134 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE one is warned against "thinking that the Hebrews had one clear-cut scheme of life" (p. 15). And indeed one discovers to his dismay that in order to attain so unified a doctrine, the expositor has not only been forced to consider the Alexandrine Jews as non-Hebraic in their genius-which is defensible-but also to disregard the prophets (p. 26). Again, though Reason is held to be a guide upon which one can rely as "of equal authority with the recorded Will of Jehovah" (p. 33), yet on its "place and scope" "the Hebrews were of the most singularly divided mind, ranging from a position that human Reason was the same as God's Reason ... to one which denied that human Reason could pierce beyond the veil and which limited its scope to the mere practical conduct of life" (p. 41). Differences of opinion do not imply philosophical incapacity, but they do imply no single philosophical system. Insofar as "the philosophy of the Hebrews" is concerned, MacDonald is really discussing "the philosophy constructed out of suggestions of abstract ideas in some Old Testa- ment writings." The basis of the doctrines which he believes to be fundamental, we are told (p. 29), is no "dictum of Jehovah," but "independent thought about the facts of life." This would suggest to a student of philosophy that the Hebrews- as limited above-accepted certain facts and inferred from them the existence of an anthropomorphic God, free-will, cosmic flux, the finality of death, the identity of evil and stupidity. But if they did this, it would be of the utmost importance to know by what arguments they reached their conclusions. For the history of occidental philosophy is full of doctrines, each in conflict with the others, which start from the same facts of life. Indeed, in Greece, the so-called ethical schools all agreed upon the end of life-self-sufficiency-and yet justified it in various ways and argued to different means of attaining it. Consequently even if one is given the premises of a philosophical system, one cannot be sure about the conclusions and, given the conclusions, one cannot be sure what reasoning led to them. MacDonald gives us, it is true, the tenets of what he calls the Hebraic philosophy, but as far as this reviewer is con- cerned, how the Hebrews arrived at them is still obscure. This does not mean that no suggestion is given of their historical filiation or of their relative importance in different portions of the Old Testament, but by what course of reasoning they were substantiated does not appear to be set forth. Thus the view of God as anthropomorphic, fallible, and mutable is extremely interesting and one which would account for the erratic course of human history, its ironical turns, its cruelty and arbitrariness. If the God at the helm were an arch-humorist, as Heine suggested, all this becomes more intel-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 135 ligible than it would be if God were Eternal Justice. By what logic this the- ology could be sustained is a question therefore of the greatest importance. Yet MacDonald nowhere gives it, contenting himself with the statement that the Hebrews simply believed it. "A primary object of all Hebrew philosophy was to determine His nature and not to question His existence" (p. 29). " Three at least of these four positions . . . are simply stated, or implied, by them- selves as self-evident" (ib.). Is it in accordance with usual practice to call such beliefs by the name of "philosophy?" Philosophers have gone to the most extravagant lengths to prove their doctrines; their efforts may have seemed nonsensical, for they have more frequently than not terminated in what common-sense had always accepted anyway. But the drive behind philosophy has always been to submit beliefs-however self-evident-to ra- tional criticism, not to raise the question, What do I believe? but, What have I any reason to believe? If the history of Occidental philosophy were simply the record of philosophical conclusions, it would be not much more than what any educated man takes for granted. Every philosopher has always controlled his reasoning by some tenets external to his system, some of which have not always been clear to him as assumptions because they were part and parcel of the generally accepted beliefs of his time. Thus even a Bishop Berkeley, when he terminates his philosophy, gives us a world with subjects, objects, God, immutable laws of science, and all the rest, but the interpretation of all this is to a large extent his own, as are the very ingenious arguments upon which his interpretation rests. It is precisely the process of argument, the development of a system, which is the traditional interest of philosophy, and if people have declared the Hebrews to have been lacking in philosophical capacities, it has probably been due to the absence of any philosophy in this sense of the word. Nor does it follow that because a man, or a book, states ideas which "imply" a philosophy, that he, or it, has any philosophy. There is no question, how- ever practical, whose solution cannot be said to imply a philosophy. A dog, as Meyerson suggests, snapping at a piece of meat tossed to him by his master, implies a belief in the external and independent existence of "things." But it is Meyerson, not the dog, who develops the canine philosophy. Similarly MacDonald could, if he would, play the philosopher to the implied beliefs of the Hebrews. But his success would not entail theirs. The second main thesis of his book, the development of Reason into the Logos-doctrine of the Gospel of Saint John should properly be discussed only by a reviewer who knows the Hebrew text at first hand. The thesis is obviously</page><page sequence="4">136 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE of great interest and if substantiated would make the break between trini- tarian Christianity and unitarian Judaism less violent. MacDonald finds Reason to be a concept whose importance grows in the later writings of the Old Testament. Throughout the Bible, he maintains (p. 30), the Hebrews show this intellectual instrument in use, but in some portions of the Scriptures -especially Proverbs--their awareness of its existence is made more explicit. In the opening of the fourth chapter of Proverbs, the place of Reason in edu- cation is insisted upon. Here it is entirely "utilitarian and moral" (p. 33); no mention is made of its power to reach Jehovah. But as this might and did develop into theoretical agnosticism (p. 35), something must be found to mediate between the God, Whose character Reason could not explore, and man. The attempt to find this--which seems legitimate enough to a student of the history of philosophy--causes the greatest distress to MacDonald. He refers with impatience to "thinking and attitudes which are of the highest unreality and, indeed, fantastic almost to insanity" (p. 37), and to "insane and non-realistic speculations [such] as those of Philo and other Alexandrine thinkers" (p. 95). This puts the author of the Ethiopic Enoch, Philo, and, by implication, all Christian Neo-platonists into the same class, as demented beings who cannot accept an anthropomorphic and transcendent God and His creation without question. And yet it is out of this tradition, before it became contaminated with "emanationism," that the notion of the Son of God is said to have arisen (p. 39). It is somewhat confusing, one will admit, to find the author of a book on the first page of which appears the Nicene Creed, objecting so violently to that doctrine from which he himself maintains part of the Nicene Creed was a logical development. The fact that I Enoch does not call the Messiah by the word "Son" and that IV Esdras does, does not to the writer of this review seem of any philosophical importance--though it has a certain importance in the history of metaphor, for the two Messiahs seem to have almost every other attribute in common, to say nothing of the names by which these attributes are called. That the Messiah is the Logos is largely a Philonic notion; it also appears in the Fourth Gospel; but Reason is not the Logos in the Philonic sense; it is the Logos in the Johannine sense. The reader may do what he will with this. We are given in the concluding portions of Professor MacDonald's book a picture of the way Reason became personified. It would be a mere repetition of the passages under discussion to present the argument and the reader may well be referred to the work itself. It is enough to say that no single and unified account of Reason is to be found in the Old Testament but that the</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 137 meaning of the term varies, the two outstanding variations being the "per- sonified and teaching Reason in the world" (p. 58) of Ben Sira and the Eternal Reason of Proverbs (p. 59). The outcome is best expressed in the author's Epilogue where it is suggested that according to Ben Sira Reason is the "soul, or spirit" of the "ceremonial of the tabernacle," through which "the Levitical dispensation spoke to the people" (p. 147); according to the Book of Wisdom, it is close to the Holy Spirit; according to the Fourth Gospel, it was mani- fested in Jesus Christ. "The author of our Fourth Gospel completely accepted that view of the personality of Christ which recorded Him as the Reason described in the eighth chapter of Proverbs, but now incarnate and visible and speaking immediately to men" (p. 148). Why such an account is in itself less "fantastic" or "unrealistic" than Philo's, one must let the author explain. GEORGE BOAS Baltimore</page></plain_text>
