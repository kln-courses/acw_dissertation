<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Beckett, Painting and the Question of  “the human” Kevin Brazil New College, University of Oxford This article contextualizes Samuel Beckett’s art criticism within post-war French critical  debate about what constitutes “the human.” Beckett announces the question as central to  the period. The post-war debate traversed the spheres of aesthetics, politics, and philoso- phy, and Beckett’s criticism is here brought into contact with that of his contemporaries:  Jean-Paul Sartre, Francis Ponge, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Martin Heidegger.  Consequently, a more historicized reading of Beckett’s art criticism and of the politi- cal stakes of his work comes into focus, especially in regard to“The End,” Eleutheria,  and Molloy. This article proposes that Beckett’s art criticism as well as his fiction be  understood as part of the history of critical theory. Keywords: Samuel Beckett / visual art / “the human” / post-war literature  /  critical theory Ce qui veut dire que le visage humain n’a pas encore trouvé sa face et que c’est  au peintre à lui donner. —  Antonin Artaud,  “Le Visage Humain”  (Œuvres 1534) Which means that the human face has not yet found its face and that  it’s up to the painter to give it one. —   Antonin Artaud,  “The Human Face”  (Watchfiends &amp; rack  screams 277) Artaud’s declaration of the task of the painter, with its untranslatable dis-tinction between the human visage and and its face, was written to accom-pany an exhibition of his paintings and drawings held at the Galerie Pierre  in Paris from 4–20 July in 1947. This declaration proved prophetic. In 1982, the  </page> <page sequence="2"> 82 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 Barbican Centre in London titled a survey of post-war French painting: “After- math France, 1945–1954: New Images of Man,” thereby retrospectively discern- ing that the question of the human was one that was explored in the work of artists  as stylistically diverse as André Fougeron, Pablo Picasso, Nicolas de Staël, Bram  van Velde, and Wols. The post-war concern with the human was not confined  to the visual arts. The philosophical debate around humanism was perhaps the  central debate in post-Liberation France. Jean-Paul Sartre’s Existentialism is a  Humanism (1946), Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Humanism and Terror (1947), and  Martin Heidegger’s Letter on Humanism (1949) were published in this period. And  in the political sphere, the electorally triumphant Parti Communiste Française  framed its mission in terms of a utopian Marxist humanism. The question of the  human was one that traversed the boundaries of the spheres of aesthetics and  politics in such a manner as to suggest the inadequacy of their conceptual sepa- ration. Following the logic of Jacques Rancière, we can understand both spheres  as being engaged in a battle over “the distribution of the sensible” (The Politics of  Aesthetics 12) over what can or cannot be disclosed to the subject as being in com- mon — in this period figured as the “human” — and the differing forms of political  subjectivity available within these configurations of community. Such was the field in which Samuel Beckett wrote three essays of art criticism  that were his major contributions to the genre: “Le peinture des van Veldes ou  le monde et le pantalon” (1946); “The New Object/Peintres de l’Empêchment”  (1948); and “Three Dialogues” (1949) co-authored with George Duthuit. Given  that this period from 1945–1949, what he later called “his frenzy of writing”  (Knowlson 358) was one in which major works were written — the Nouvelles,  the Trilogy, Waiting for Godot — Beckett’s art criticism has rightly been seen  as offering a critical companion to those works, although discussions of the  “Three Dialogues” have tended to exclude the equally rich critical commentary  of the previous two essays. Beckett’s criticism also positions itself in the post-war  humanist debate, for Beckett concludes his first essay on the van Velde brothers  by declaring “parlons de l’ ‘humain’ ” (“let us speak of the ‘human’ ”) (Disjecta 131).  Thomas Trezise was one of the first critics to explore the ways in which Beckett’s  work “radically questioned the foundations of humanism” (ix) by exploring his  “affinity” with figures such as Bataille, Blanchot, Deleuze, and Derrida (5). David  Houston Jones has also explored the encounters between “Beckettian testimony  and recent rethinkings of human epistemology” (15), drawing parallels with the  work of Agamben and Lyotard. It was precisely through a dialogue with painting that Beckett chose to “speak  of the ‘human.’ ” Beckett’s place within the debates is contextualized by the jour- nals in which his work was being published: Cahiers d’Art, Les Temps Modernes,  Fontaine and the post-war version of Transition.1 Publication in those journals  situates Beckett within what Anna Boschetti has analyzed as “the field of intel- lectual journals” in post-war France (3).Understanding Beckett’s works within  a dynamic critical field allows a more politicized understanding of his works  to come into focus, works that were marked by a pervasive if apathetic hostility  </page> <page sequence="3"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 83 towards the promises of post-war Marxist humanism. After contextualizing  Beckett’s art criticism, I will turn to the moments in which this questioning of the  human appears in his fiction and drama, most pointedly in “The End,” Eleutheria,  and Molloy. This is not to say that questioning the human is limited to those texts;  rather, they provide the most specific points of intersection between the concerns  of Beckett’s criticism and that of its wider historical context. “Le peinture des van veLdes ou Le monde et Le pantaLon” Beckett’s first work of published art criticism, “Le peinture des van Veldes ou  le monde et le pantalon,”(“The painting of the van Veldes, or the moon and the  trousers”), was written in January 1945 and published in the October 1946 issue  of Cahiers d’Art, which Beckett described in a letter to George Reavey as the “2nd  post-liberation number of the Cahiers” (31 October 1945, Letters 2 24). “Post- liberation” is an apt description of the concerns of the issue, in which the editor,  Christian Zevros, had included a dossier of texts by Lenin and Stalin on the  political role of the artist and writer (341–342). In his introduction, Zevros writes  that in reading these texts, “l’imagination et les libertés de la future condition  humaine brouillent nos yeux de leur rosée” (“the imagination and the freedoms of  the future human condition will cloud our eyes with their glow”) (341). It is precisely such a vision of the future human condition that Beckett attacks  in his essay. In discussing the work of Bram and Geer van Velde, Beckett writes  that what unites their different approaches is an interest in “la condition humaine”  (“the human condition)” (Disjecta 129). For a painter, this interest in the human  condition means to be condemned to strive to paint the impossible, since for  the painter, Beckett writes, “le chose est impossible” (“the thing is impossible”)  (Disjecta 129). This impossible thing is both the object of representation and the  task of the painter himself. For both artists, it is the inescapable condition of time  that makes it impossible the perceive, and thus represent, the object. In the work  of Bram van Velde, this inescapable condition leads him to turn to the “champ  intérieur” (“interior field”) (125) in order to paint “la chose morte . . . [l]a chose  immobile dans le vide” (“the dead thing .  .  . the thing immobile in the void”)  (Disjecta 126). This striving after the impossible thing is contrasted with the  rational “médetations plastiques” (“plastic meditations”; 127) of Georges Braque,  whose work Beckett considers as giving the impression of a “hypothèse qui s’en  dégage” (“a hypothesis that has disengaged itself ”) (127). Geer van Velde’s work,  in contrast, is discussed as being entirely turned towards the outside in an attempt  to capture time. Yet this is described as being as futile an effort as representation  of Heraclitus’ river, in which no one can step twice, and his work thus appears  as a second form of a “memento mori” (Disjecta 129). In fact, in this essay, Beck- ett defines the entire history of painting in regard to this problematics of time:  “A quoi les arts représentatifs se sont-ils acharnés depuis toujours? A voulouir  arrêter le temps, en le représentant” (“For what have the representative arts always  thirsted? To want to stop time by representing it”) (Disjecta 126). </page> <page sequence="4"> 84 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 In an earlier letter to Thomas McGreevy dated 8 September 1934 on the  work of Cézanne, Beckett criticized those painters such as the Impressionists who  ignored this “discrepancy between that which cannot stay still for its phases &amp;  that which can,” praising Cézanne for being the first to understand “the dynamic  intrusion to be himself &amp; so landscape to be something by definition unapproach- ably alien,” thus marking the beginning of “the deanthropomorphizations of the  artist” (Letters 1 223). That such a realization of painting’s inability to depict the  inescapable condition of time is linked to a critique of anthropomorphism is  underlined in “Le peinture des van Veldes” when Beckett refers to a jet of sheep’s  urine in the paintings of Paulus Potter as the “symbole par excellence de la fuite  des heures” (“the symbol par excellence of the flight of the hours”) (Disjecta 126).  In a recurring trope in Beckett’s work, a scatological image of animality is used  to mark out the limits of human capacity to represent time. Beckett concludes the essay by returning to the subject of this impossible  human condition by turning to question the very concept of the human itself.  “Pour finir, parlons d’autre chose, parlons de l’‘humain’ ” (“To finish, let us speak  of something else, let us speak of the ‘human’ ” (Disjecta 131). Beckett declares  that this is a word that has returned today with “une fureur jamais égalée” (“a  fury never before equaled”) (Disjecta 131), hence Beckett is highly cynical about  its presence in contemporary debate, calling it “un vocable, et sans doute un  concept aussi, qu’on reserve pour les temps des grand massacres” (“a word, and  no doubt a concept also, that is reserved for times of great massacres”) (Disjecta  131). Furthermore, it is a word that he sees as abundantly appearing in artistic  debate. For Beckett, it is “épouvantable” (“appalling”) that an artist should have  anything to do with “the human,” for its reintroduction to the sphere of art  is capable of destroying poetry, music, painting, and thought for the next 50  years (Disjecta 131). Against the humanist painter who declares that all men are  brothers, Beckett proposes his own mordant aesthetic manifesto: L’espace vous intéresse? Faisons-le craquer. Le temps vous tracasse? Tuons-le tous ensemble. La béaute? L’homme réuni. La bonté? Étouffer. La vérité? Le pet du plus grand nombre. You are interested in space? Make it crack. You are tormented by time? Let’s kill it together. Beauty? Man re-united. Goodness? Suffocate. Truth? The fart of the greatest number. (Disjecta 132) The tiniest part of this kind of painting would ironically contain more human- ity than what he calls “leurs processions vers un bonheur de mouton sacré” (“their  processions for the happiness of the sacred sheep”) (Disjecta 132). Once more, an  image of the animal is used to mock the achievements of humanity. Beckett does  </page> <page sequence="5"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 85 not deny that there are “conditions éternelles de la vie” (“eternal conditions of  life”) (Disjecta 132), but states that “il y a son coût” (“they have their price”) (132).  These conditions of life that Beckett wishes to see realized on the painted canvas  have ultimately little to do with the “human.” Humanism:   “a word reserved for times of great massacres” Beckett was correct in his cultural diagnosis: humanism had returned with a  vengeance to post-war French debate. Discussion of this context must attend  to the term’s notorious nebulosity. As early as October 1945, in his response to  Sartre’s lecture “Existentialism is a Humanism,” the Surrealist Pierre Navaille  would complain that: Today, unfortunately, the term humanism is used to designate philosophical schools  of thought, not according to two meanings, but according to three, four, five, or six.  Nowadays, everybody is a humanist. Even certain Marxists, who pride themselves  on being classical rationalists, are humanists in a diluted sort of way, stripped of  the liberal ideas of the previous century — embracing instead a liberalism refracted  through the current crisis. If Marxists can claim to be humanists, then followers  of the various religions — Christians, Hindus and many others — can also claim  to be humanists, as do existentialists, and in general all philosophers. (Qtd. in  Existentialism is a Humanism 62–23) As Denis Kamboucher has commented, given this confusion, “[a] system- atic history of the ‘humanist’ theme in twentieth-century Europe and notably  in post-war France should one day be written” (19). Similarly, in his account of  the emergence of an “an atheism that is not humanist” in mid-century French  philosophy, Geroulanous Stefanos describes the post-war period as witnessing  a “short lived humanist reconciliation” (210), prompting a series of critiques by  Maurice Blanchot, Martin Heidegger, and Jean Hyppolite. The kind of history  sought by Kamboucher will not be attempted here; rather I wish to show what  Beckett’s distinct contribution to the histories of humanism and anti-humanism  might be. And to do so, I will adopt the approach suggested by Beckett’s skepti- cal observation that the “human” is “a word, and no doubt a concept also, that is  reserved for the times of the greatest massacres” (Disjecta 131). There is a gap, a  “without a doubt” between the deployment of the word “human” and its correlate  “humanist,” and the concept denoted, leading to the proliferation of humanisms  described by Navaille. In contextualizing Beckett’s questioning of “the human,”  my intent here is not to adjudicate the competing theoretical claims of Sartre,  Ponge, Merleau-Ponty, and Heidegger. Instead, I wish to draw attention to how  proclaiming allegiance to the human is used discursively to relate philosophy and  aesthetics to the “great massacres” of history (Disjecta 131). As Navaille observed, the Marxist version of humanism that became promi- nent after the war resulted from two related developments. The first was the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 86 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 prestige and moral authority that the P.C.F. enjoyed as a result of its leading role  in the Resistance, earning it the title of the “parti des fusillées” (“party of the  shot”) (Rioux 54). This was accompanied by electoral success, with the P.C.F.  winning the largest share of the vote in Assembly Elections on 21 October  1945 and 10 November 1946, a dominance which lasted until the crisis of 1947,  when the Communists were expelled from government on 5 May 1947 (Rioux  112–132). The second was a resurgent interest in the humanism of the early Marx,  particularly as developed in the 1844 “Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts”  in which the theory of alienation and communism’s overcoming of alienation was  outlined. As Marx writes: “Communism as completed naturalism is humanism  and as completed humanism is naturalism” (97). As Mark Poster notes, French  editions of this text “did not appear until 1937 and even then it was ignored until  after the Liberation . . . [thus] for political and textual reasons, which were inter- connected, no real reading of Marx was possible in France until after the Second  World War” (42). In the case of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, however, a second important philo- sophical source for presenting their thought as a form of humanism was what  Vincent Descombes has termed “the humanist interpretation of Hegelian ideal- ism” (52) developed by Alexandre Kojève in his course on Hegel given at the École  des Hautes Études in Paris from 1933 to 1939. In Descombes’s account, Kojève’s  replacing of the Spirit with Man in his “anthropological version of Hegelian phi- losophy” (27; italics original) ultimately requires “[t]he identity of subject and  object . . . [and that] man (subject) would encounter nothing outside of himself (in  the object) to impede the realisation of his projects” (28). Descombes summarizes  this interpretation of Hegel as an inverted theology: “Humanist atheism reclaims  [divine attributes] for the human subject, who in this way becomes the true God.  It is precisely this substitution, whereby everywhere the word “Man” is written  to replace the word “God,” which defines humanism” (29; italics original). Judith  Butler has also stressed the anthropological nature of Kojève’s reading, writing  that “Kojève went so far as to claim that Hegel’s entire theological speculations  ought to be understood as a theory of human action” (65). In relation to Being  and Nothingness, Butler writes that “[t]he effort at anthropogenesis elaborated by  Kojève finds existential transcription in the Sartrian contention that all human  desire is a function of the desire to become God. But for Sartre, this desire is  bound to fail” (95). This negating desire can only be resolved in the realm of the imagination,  leading to Sartre’s privileging of literary works, which “manifest the ‘desire to  be’ through creating an embodiment — the text — which reflects the self that  is its author” (Butler 96). In his introduction to the inaugural issue of Les Temps  Modernes, Sartre linked his privileging of literature to a theory of humanism. By  virtue of the fact that each writer is situated in his era, the practice of an engaged  literature will discover aspects of a human condition that for Sartre is absolute,  but “il l’est à son heure, dans son milieu, sur sa terre” (“but is it in his [man’s]  hour, in his milieu, on the earth”) (“Présentation” 7). This “engaged literature”  </page> <page sequence="7"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 87 was the praxis of Sartre’s existentialist humanism, which was launched into public  consciousness with the lecture “Existentialism is a Humanism” in October 1945,  marking a catalyzing moment in the post-war humanist debate. sartre, ponge, and tHe future of man In an article entitled “A propos de l’existentialisme: Mise au point,” published  in Action on 29 December 1944, Sartre had already outlined the key elements  of his argument that existentialism was a humanism. As was the case for the  October lecture, the article was a response to Communist critiques of Sartre’s  existentialism, and his response was to claim that, in fact, his refusal to “grant  man an eternally established human nature . . . isn’t too far from the conception of  man found in Marx” (“A More Precise Characterization of Existentialism” 157).  After stating the central tenet of his existentialism, that “[e]xistentialism, on the  contrary, maintains that in man — and man alone — existence precedes essence”  (156), Sartre concludes: “[h]ave I said enough to make it clear that existentialism  is no mournful delectation but a humanist philosophy of action, effort, combat, and  solidarity?” (160; italics original). These points are reiterated in “Existentialism is  a Humanism.” In the lecture, Sartre rejects the idea of a human nature in favor  of a “universal human condition” (Existentialism is a Humanism 42), grounded in  a subjectivity attained in the presence of the Other, which leads to existing in  the world with the “absolute freedom of choice” (EH 43) to define one’s projects.  Concluding the lecture, Sartre stresses the transcendental core of human subjec- tivity in relation to the world outside oneself: “since man is this transcendence,  and grasps objects only in relation to such transcendence, he himself is the core  and focus of this transcendence” (EH 52). For Sartre, the human defines himself  precisely in his domination of the objects of the world. As an example of a writer who opposes “mournful delectation” with a vision  of man in a constitutive and dominating relation to the objects of the world,  in both the Action article and his lecture Sartre refers to “Notes premiers de  l’Homme” by Francis Ponge, which was published in the inaugural issue of Les  Temps Modernes. In this aphoristic text, written between 1943 and 1944, Ponge  prophesies a future deification of man: [Man] has developed from himself the idea of God. It is necessary to reinstate this  back into himself . . . It is necessary to replace the idea of God with the idea of man.  And simply live. (“Notes” 70, 73) The text ends with the phrase quoted by Sartre: “Man is the future of man”  (75). Ponge was a member of the P.C.F. at this time, and this conception of man  as a future to come is heavily indebted to the early Marx. This can be seen in  Ponge’s art criticism, particularly on Georges Braque.2 In “Braque ou l’art mod- erne comme événement et plaisir,” published in Action in January 1947, Ponge  forcefully states the relations between his politics and aesthetics, declaring soli- darity with “the political realists, whose disciple and friend I flatter myself I am”  </page> <page sequence="8"> 88 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 (“Braque, or Modern Art as Event and Pleasure” 43) with “realists in politics,”  here denoting the P.C.F. The Marxist influence is evident in this text when Ponge  paraphrases the “Theses on Feuerbach” to define the artist: “He is one who in no  wise explains the world, but changes it. You recognise the formula, more or less”  (“Braque” 45). By not simply representing objects in the world, but also creating  new forms of viewing them, Braque “presents the future” in two related forms:  “[t]he future of nature and the future of man” (Ponge, “Braque” 138). Thus, with  this attempt to depict an increasing sense of man’s perceptual understanding of  the world, Ponge praises Braque’s depictions of objects, “which pull us out of the  darkness of our night, from the old version of man (and its so-called humanism)  to reveal to us, Man, the Order to Come” (“Braque” 140). In “Le peinture des  van Veldes,” Beckett had already criticized Braque’s work giving the impression  “d’hypothèse qui s’en degage” (a hypothesis that disengages itself) (Disjecta 127)  from the attempt to depict the relation to the impossible object. But Beckett also  translated this text by Ponge for Transition Forty-Nine, and his comments to the  journal’s editor, Georges Duthuit, are revealing: Ponge on Braque It is revolting. “Braque is now over 60 and the world is beginning  to fit into his groove”!!. What oft was thought. For someone who is a pupil of the  realists in politics he is pretty unsteady on his feet. . . . What a relief to know that  we are back for good and all from the fête galante, and pitched, naked once more, in  front of the dead fish (and the lumps of coal).” (1 March 1949, Letters 2 122) The distance from Ponge’s interpretation of Braque could not be clearer. But  what is also clear is Beckett’s understanding of the political implications of Ponge’s  visual aesthetics: that they make him a pupil of the realists in politics, or the Parti  Communiste Français. This link between realist aesthetics and Communist politi- cal humanism permeated the discourse surrounding painting in post-war France.  And this link is presumed in a second Beckett essay on the van Velde brothers,  published in 1948, in which he developed an understanding of the future of the  visual arts, and the history of the relations between subject and object, in ways  diametrically opposed to Ponge. “peintres de L’empêcHment,” cézanne, and merLeau-ponty Beckett’s second essay on the work of the van Velde brothers was commissioned to  accompany an exhibition of their work: Introducing Two Modern French Painters:  Geer van Velde, Bram van Velde, held from 8–27 March 1948 at the Samuel Kootz  Gallery in New York. The text was composed in French in March 1947 and Peter  Fifield has convincingly argued that Beckett himself translated the text into Eng- lish (874). The French version was published as “Peintres de l’Empêchement” in  the June 1948 issue of Derrière le miroir, the journal of the Galerie Maeght in Paris.  The New York exhibition was one half of an exchange with the Galerie Maeght,  with the exhibition in Paris being the first exhibition of post-war abstract Ameri- can art in Paris. As Serge Guilbault has written, this exchange program, coming  </page> <page sequence="9"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 89 in the wake of France’s acceptance of the Marshall Plan, was widely perceived by  French critics as “part of a wide-ranging and all but unstoppable cultural offensive  against France” (151), and furthermore, that this exchange program with Galerie  Maeght was indirectly funded by the American Embassy in Paris (150–151; 236  n.174). Beckett’s essay is thus positioned within the wider post-war struggle over  the perceived shift of the center of the visual avant-garde from Paris to New York. The English version of the essay opens with an explicit acknowledgement of  this battle: “We are now freely informed . . . that the Paris school, whatever that  means, is finished, whatever that means” (“The New Object” 878). In contrast,  Beckett argues that it is in the art of Bram and Geer van Velde that the School  of Paris has its future, and does so by outlining their place within a theory of the  history of painting. Beckett writes that “[t]he history of painting is the history of  its relation to its object, a relation evolving, necessarily, in terms first of extension,  then of penetration” (“New” 878). But, as Beckett continues, “the object of repre- sentation is at all times in resistance to representation” (“New” 879). Developing  this history of the object’s necessary “resistance” to consciousness and representa- tion — the “empêchement” of the essay’s French title — Beckett locates a contem- porary “crisis”: “For what remains to be represented if the essence of the object is  to elude representation?” (“New” 879). His answer is that “[t]here remains to be  represented the conditions of that elusion” (“New” 879). And this is what Beckett  states the art of the van Veldes achieves, realizing an “art of confinement” (“New”  880). As Beckett writes in the French version of this essay, their work promises a  “bel avenir” (“great future”) because ‘le même deuil les mène loin l’un de l’autre,  de deuil de l’objet.” (“the same mourning carries them away from each other, the  mourning of the object”) (Disjecta 135). Significantly, as Peter Fifield observes, in  the typescript for this essay, Beckett had originally written “recherche” instead of  “deuil,” and “search” is what appears in the English version. But this was replaced  with “deuil” in Beckett’s hand, leading to a far more contextually aware allusion  to a future in which painting will carry out an endless work of mourning for an  irrecoverable object (Fifield 874). This undercuts and ironizes the rhetoric of the  future of painting and of Man that Beckett perceived in Ponge’s essay on Braque,  and this change to the essay for a Parisian context indicates a conscious critique  of the post-war humanist discourse surrounding the visual arts. It was in the work of Cézanne that Beckett located the beginnings of the  historical crisis whereby the subject began to be alienated from the object. Of  Cézanne’s treatment of landscape, Beckett wrote to McGreevy that “Cézanne  seems to have been the first to see landscape &amp; state it as material of a strictly  peculiar order, incommensurable with all human expressions whatsoever” (8  September 1934, Letters 1 222). In Cézanne’s self-portraits Beckett saw that  this alienation from the world also led to an alienation from one’s own self.  Cézanne, Beckett wrote, “has the sense of his incommensurability not only with  life of such a different order as landscape but even with life of his own order,  even with the life . . . operative in himself ” (16 September 1934,  Letters 1 227).  Cézanne was central to Beckett’s interpretation of modern art, one in which the  </page> <page sequence="10"> 90 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 “deanthropomorphizations of the artist” led to a wider questioning of the human.  Cézanne came to occupy a similar position in the post-war thought of Merleau- Ponty, and in tracing the differences between their respective interpretations of  Cézanne, Beckett’s art criticism can be further positioned within the politics of  post-war humanism. Merleau-Ponty’s “Cézanne’s Doubt” was published in Fontaine in Decem- ber 1945, between the appearance of his Phenomenology of Perception (1945) and  Humanism and Terror (1947). In this essay, Cézanne’s painting acts as bridge to  link the phenomenological subjectivity of the former with the political philosophy  of the latter. This was made explicit in the preface to the essay collection Sense  and Non-Sense published in 1948: while “today’s citizen is not sure whether the  human world is possible” the fact that “Cézanne won out against chance” shows  that “men, too, can win provided they will measure the dangers and the task” (5).  The means by which the “human world is possible” were developed by Merleau- Ponty in Humanism and Terror, which grew out of a series of articles on Arthur  Koestler’s Darkness at Noon entitled “Le Yogi et le Prolétaire” which appeared in  Les Temps Modernes between October 1946 and January 1947. Beckett’s “Poèmes  38–39” appeared alongside the second part in the November 1946 issue, and his  observation to George Reavey that “[t]he boys are very cross with Koestler” (15  December 1946, Letters 2 49) indicates his awareness of Merleau-Ponty’s sustained  attack on Koestler’s criticism of the Moscow Show Trials in Darkness at Noon. Yet Merleau-Ponty admits that “the book poses the problem of our times”  (Humanism and Terror 2) — the role of violence in politics. Drawing on Kojève’s  interpretation of the Master-Slave dialectic in Hegel, Merleau-Ponty argues that  given that “[a]ll we know is different kinds of violence .  .  . we ought to prefer  revolutionary violence because it has a future of humanism” (H&amp;T 107). For  Merleau-Ponty, this humanism is to be found in the Marx of the “Economic and  Philosophical Manuscripts,” and the “real question” that Darkness at Noon raises is  whether “communism [is] still equal to its humanist intentions?” (H&amp;T xviii). The  answer here is a cautious yes, so long as one takes Marxism as a theory of “subjec- tivity and action committed within a historical situation” (H&amp;T 22). Revolution- ary violence can lead to a future of humanism through the recognition of the “mis- sion in the proletariat,” which moves through history towards “the recognition of  man by man” (112). The historical proletariat is key for Merleau-Ponty: it is “the  sole authentic intersubjectivity because it alone lives simultaneously the separation  and union of individuals” (116–117). Thus, “[t]he theory of the proletariat as the  vehicle of history’s meaning is the humanist face of Marxism” (118). Humanism and Terror ends by comparing the political philosophy outlined  to “a view which like the most fragile object of perception — a soap bubble — or  like the most simple dialogue, embraces indivisibly all the order and all the  disorder of the world” (189). Along with the description of the proletariat as the  “sole authentic intersubjectivity,” this indicates that Merleau-Ponty is developing  the political implications of his Phenomenology of Perception. The basic phenom- enological premise of the Phenomenology of Perception, that “[w]e are caught up in  </page> <page sequence="11"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 91 the world and do not succeed in extricating ourselves from it in order to achieve  consciousness of the world” (5), implies the historicity of the subject: “there is  history only for a subject who lives through it, and a subject only in so far as he is  historically situated” (200). In the Phenonemology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty uses Cézanne’s work to  illustrate an exemplary, historically situated model of phenomenological per- ception. In discussing the patient Schneider, whose coordination between his  visual and tactile perception is impaired and who can only coordinate tactile and  visual perception through linguistic description, Merleau-Ponty contrasts this  with Cézanne’s description of his “motif ” falling into place (PP 152 n. 71). This  structural unity between modes of perception is described as “this subject-object  dialogue, this drawing together, by the subject, of the meaning diffused through  the object, and, by the object, of the subject’s intentions — a process which is phys- iognomic perception” (PP 152–153). Cézanne’s foregrounding of the “immanent  or incipient significance in the living body” (PP 230) makes his work an example  of the future overcoming of human self-alienation, and in “Cézanne’s Doubt,”  this is presented as victory of the human over the inhuman. At first sight, Merleau-Ponty admits that “the inhuman character of his  paintings” could be seen to “only represent a flight from the human world, the  alienation of his humanity” (Sense and Non-Sense 10–11). And this too could be an  alienation from the landscape that “itself is stripped of the attributes which make  it ready for animistic communions” (S&amp;N 16). But for Merleau-Ponty, this doubt  is overcome: “But indeed only a human being is capable of such a vision which  penetrates right to the root of things beneath the imposed order of humanity  . . . one sees how Cézanne was able to revive the classical definition of art: man  added to nature” (S&amp;N 16). This is achieved as a result of Cézanne’s perception  of the world, which makes “a basic distinction not between ‘the senses’ and ‘the  understanding’ but rather between the spontaneous organization of the things  we perceive and the human organization of ideas and sciences” (S&amp;N 13). This  is Cézanne’s “intuitive science,” by means of which alienation is overcome, and  Merleau-Ponty quotes Cézanne’s statement that: “ ‘The landscape thinks itself in  me,’ he said, ‘and I am its consciousness’ ” (S&amp;N 17). In an ironic inversion of Merleau-Ponty’s comparison of Cézanne with a  psychiatric patient, Beckett had written to McGreevey that as a consequence  of his treatment of landscape, “Cézanne leaves landscape maison d’aliénés [a  lunatic asylum] &amp; a better understanding of the term ‘natural’ for an idiot” (8  September 1934, Letters 1 222). For Beckett, Cézanne’s work reveals the alien- ation of man from man, with “[e]ven the portrait beginning to be dehumanised  as the individual feels himself more &amp; more hermetic and alone &amp; his neighbour  a coagulum as alien as a protoplast or God” (Letters I 223). Cézanne’s painting is  thus the site of an essential difference between Beckett and Merleau-Ponty, one  that is not without political implications. In Cézanne’s work, Merleau-Ponty sees  the occurrence of the subject-object dialogue that is central to his phenomenol- ogy and his politics. In contrast, in “Recent Irish Poetry” (1934) written a few  </page> <page sequence="12"> 92 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 months before his letters to McGreevy on Cézanne, Beckett had declared that  “the new thing that has happened, or the old thing that has happened again” was  “the breakdown of the object . . . [and] the breakdown of the subject,” what he  called the “rupture of the lines of communication” (Disjecta 70). Years later, when  Beckett was engaged in a correspondence with the art critic Georges Duthuit on  the work of Bram van Velde that would form the basis of the published “Three  Dialogues,” Beckett wrote to Duthuit: “I remember coming out, the regulation 20  years ago, being at that time a little less than now, with an angry article on modern  Irish poets, in which I set up, as a criterion of modern poetry, an awareness of the  vanished object. Already!” (2 March 1949, Letters 2 131). And it is in the “Three  Dialogues” that Beckett makes a final attempt to define how this “awareness of  the vanished object” might be realised in painting, in ways that once again show  that this involves a questioning of the human. “tHree diaLogues” and réalisme socialism “Three Dialogues: Samuel Beckett and Georges Duthuit,” published in Transition  Forty-Nine, number 5, in December 1949, was not Beckett’s first contribution to  Transition. (This new Transition, edited by Georges Duthuit, was a short-lived  attempt to revive the spirit of Eugene Jolas’s more well known pre-war magazine  transition.) As John Pilling and Séan Lawlor have documented, Beckett helped to  translate approximately thirty articles or poems published in Transition between  1948 and 1950 (88–89), and was as such central to the journal’s project. This was  defined in the inaugural issue as to “to assemble for the English-speaking world  the best of French art and thought, whatever the style and whatever the applica- tion” (Duthuit 5), although advertisements in later issues for periodicals such  as Direction (no. 3), The Hudson Review (no. 5), and The Partisan Review (no. 5)  indicate that this English-speaking world was primarily an American one. Transi- tion, then, acted as a conduit by which a certain image of French art and thought  was produced for an American audience. And with its combination of presenting  developments in French art alongside works of literary theory by Georges Bataille  and Sartre, the journal can be seen as a part of the prehistory of the creation of  what François Cusset has called the “textual American object of theory” (ix). It  was as a participant in such critical debates that Beckett’s critical was presented  to an American audience. In Transition Forty-Nine, the central topic of debate Duthuit presented in  the “Documents” section is the relationship between a work of art and the wider  political community. Reproductions of the paintings by Tal-Coat, Masson, and  Bram van Velde discussed in the “Three Dialogues” are interspersed among  statements by Braque, Léger, Matisse, Miro, and Fourgeron on the relationship  between the artist and his community, inviting an interpretation of the position of  the “Three Dialogues” on this topic. “B’s” comments in “Three Dialogues” address  this question by repeating his previous criticisms of Marxist aesthetics and their  attendant humanism, and valorizing instead the work of Bram van Velde. In the  </page> <page sequence="13"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 93 third dialogue, “B” claims Bram van Velde’s work is of a new order to all previous  great artists. Of these, “B” claims: Among those whom we call great artists, I can think of none whose concern was  not predominantly with his expressive possibilities, those of his vehicle, those of  humanity. The assumption underlying all painting is that the domain of the maker  is the domain of the feasible. (Disjecta 142) As in his criticism of Ponge, Beckett connects a concern with the expressive  possibilities of painting — its ability to represent the object — with a philosophy of  humanism. Beckett’s claim that Bram van Velde’s painting has moved beyond the  “misapprehension . . . that its function was to express, by means of paint” (Disjecta  143), therefore marks a move beyond a concern with the human. Beckett also  comments on the relationship between art and politics when he states that “[t]he  realisation that art has always been bourgeois, though it may dull our pain before  the achievements of the socially progressive, is finally of scant interest” (Disjecta  144). The type of “socially progressive” art that Beckett dismisses here is exempli- fied in Transition by what is referred to as “the Fougeron case” (“Documents” 110).  This scandal was caused by the exhibition of the painting Parisiennes aux Marché  by André Fougeron at the Salon d”Automne in 1948, which graphically depicted  the food shortages still endemic in Paris after the war. Beckett had in fact already  encountered this painting. In his letter attacking Ponge’s essay on Braque that he  translated for this issue, Beckett concluded his diatribe by sarcastically writing:  “What a relief to know that we are back for good and all from the fête galante, and  pitched, naked once more, in front of the dead fish (and the lumps of coal)” (Let- ters 2 122). As Serge Guilbault has shown, the dead fish in this painting became  a metonymic reference point for debating the political and aesthetic implications  of réalisme socialisme in what became known as “La Bataille réalisme-abstraction”  in the immediate post-war years (Reconstructing Modernism 44). The claims that  Beckett makes in the “Three Dialogues” for an art of “invalidity, of inadequacy,  of existence at the expense of all that it excludes, all that it blinds to” (Disjecta  145) has as its paratextual opposite the “réalisme socialisme” of an artist like  Fougeron. And what this art excludes is the concern with humanity that Beckett  attempts to claim that Bram van Velde’s work has moved beyond. Yet the “Three  Dialogues” ends with B. abruptly breaking off, admitting that “I am mistaken,  I am mistaken” (Disjecta 145). There is a sense that the questioning of humanity  that Beckett demanded from the art of Bram van Velde had not been realized.  However, this was a task in which Beckett took up in his own work at this time  along lines set out in his art criticism. With this shift to exploring this questioning  in literature and drama a final set of intersections of Beckett’s work with those of  his contemporaries can be traced. </page> <page sequence="14"> 94 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 “negative antHropoLogy,” Heidegger and tHe animaL In contextualizing Beckett’s art-criticism amid a resurgent Marxist humanism, it  would of course be reductive to claim that this was only factor that determines the  political stakes of Beckett’s work. As dramatized by the behavior of the narrator of  the “The End,” which was composed in early 1946, triumphalist Marxist human- ism was something against which Beckett’s attempted reaction was indifference to  the point of self-destruction, rather than direct opposition. As the narrator of “The  End” lies begging on a street corner, pissing, shitting, and scratching himself, he  witnesses a “strange scene,” a man bellowing: “Union . . . brothers . . . Marx . . .  capital . . . bread and butter . . . love” (Expelled 52). Accused that his begging is “a  crime, an incentive to stultification and organised murder,” the narrator pockets  his pennies and heads on his way, with a closing quip that parodies the deification  of man central to the Marxism of writers such as Ponge: He must have been a religious fanatic, I could find no other explanation. Perhaps  he was an escaped lunatic. He had a nice face, a little on the red side. (Expelled 52) In Eleutheria, which Beckett wrote in January-February 1947, the utopian  dreams of post-war Marxist humanism also come in for comic assault. The text  of the play makes knowing comments on the contemporary post-war situation.  Madame Piouk’s inquiry after Madame Meck’s husband: “How is the general?”  (25), and Madame Meck’s response that “[h]is dying breath was for France”  (Eleutheria 26) raises up the image of de Gaulle, who had dramatically departed  from the political scene in January 1946. After de Gaulle’s departure, the Fourth  Republic came into being, and Paul Ramadier became its first prime minister  on 22 January 1947, leading a coalition of Socialists and Communists, an event  alluded to when Jacques asks M. Krap “What does monsieur think of the new  government?” (Eleutheria 61). For as Dr. Piouk reminds the audience: “We are  no longer living in the Third Republic” (Eleutheria 113). Indeed, it is in the char- acter of Dr. Piouk, “who loves humanity” (Eleutheria 19), that the play explicitly  attacks post-war discourses of humanism. Within Eleutheria at least, Piouk’s love  of humanity is associated with Marxism, for so effuse is his love of humanity that  Madame Krap suspects: “You wouldn’t be a Communist?” (43). Yet when pressed  to solve the problem of humanity, he suddenly proposes abortions, euthanasia,  enforced homosexuality, and the “death penalty to any woman guilty of giving  birth” (Eleutheria 44). In contrast to Piouk, Victor Krap, the failed writer at the  center of the play, can only offer what the Spectator calls a “negative anthropol- ogy,” only defining life by “what it isn’t” (147). The drama ends with a performative  enactment of this “negative anthropology,” with stage directions indicating Victor  crawling into bed and “turning his emaciated back on humanity” (170). This taste for “negative anthropology” also appears in Molloy, the work that  Beckett wrote after Eleutheria, beginning it in May 1947 and completing it that  November. Thinking back on his past learning, Molloy recalls: </page> <page sequence="15"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 95 The next pain in the balls was anthropology and the other disciplines, such as psy- chiatry, that are connected with it, disconnected, and reconnected again, according  to the latest discoveries. What I liked in anthropology was its inexhaustible faculty  of negation, its relentless definition of man, as though he were no better than God, in  terms of what he is not. But my ideas on this subject were always horribly confused,  for my knowledge of men was scant and the meaning of being beyond me. (37–39) While Molloy’s “negative anthropology” gestures back to Eleutheria, his link- ing of the definition of man with the “latest discoveries” and the “meaning of  being” also gestures outwards to another negative anthropology that appeared in  1947: the publication of a fragment of Martin Heidegger’s Letter on Humanism  which had appeared as “Lettre à Jean Beaufret” in the November 1947 issue of  Fontaine.3 The letter was Heidegger’s rejection of Sartre’s claim that “Existential- ism is a Humanism.” For Heidegger, “[e]very humanism is either grounded in a  metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one” (Basic Writings 157), and  to this extent Heidegger states his thinking is against humanism. In his detailed  account of the composition of this text, Anson Rabinbach has argued that it can  be read as “an allegory of the author’s attempt to remove himself from all ethical  considerations or demands of responsibility” (11). Here “humanism” functions discursively, as it does for Sartre, as a way in  which the philosophical thinking of Being is played out in the historical actuality  of a social world from which, for tactical reasons, Heidegger wished to extricate  himself. As early as 1940, Rabinbach shows, Heidegger had used a critique of  humanism as a mode of nihilism and metaphysics in order to distance his thinking  from the Nazi regime (19–20). In the Letter itself, this attempt to disregard recent  history is part of an effort “to create the impression of a philosophical continuity  from the pre-Rectorate period to his post-war thinking” (Rabinbach 7), one in  which, for Heidegger, “man is the being whose Being as ek-sistence consists in  his dwelling in the nearness of Being” (Basic Writings 167). However, the human  species maintains a privileged relation in this nearness to Being. Heidegger insists  that through the capacity for language, man remains distinct from the animal:  living creatures remain “separated from our ek-sistent essence by an abyss” (Basic  Writings 156). It is by way of the transgression of this border between man and animal in  Molloy that Beckett’s questioning of the human assumes a more radical nature  than that proposed by Heidegger. Despite his taste for “negative anthropology,”  Molloy initially believes that “I am human, I fancy” (78). But Molloy is haunted  by his “lust to kill” (67). This lust is consummated when he murders a solitary  stranger whom he cannot understand: “seeing that he had not ceased to breathe  I contented myself with giving him a few warm kicks in the ribs, with my heels”  (85). The relish Molloy takes in murder moves him beyond the pale of the human,  for shortly afterwards he hears a murmur and “pricks up [his] ears, like an animal I  imagine” (89). And his narrative ends with him “abandoning erect motion, that of  man” (Molloy 90). Jacques Derrida has written how throughout Heidegger’s work,  </page> <page sequence="16"> 96 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 whenever the question of difference between human and animal is broached,  “Heidegger’s discourse seems .  .  . to fall into a rhetoric which is all the more  peremptory and authoritarian for having to hide a discomfiture . . . [and that] in  these cases it leaves intact, sheltered in obscurity, the axioms of the profoundest  metaphysical humanism” (11–12). What we see in Molloy, then, is the different  paths that Beckett and Heidegger take in their contemporaneous responses to  post-war French humanism. Heidegger attempts to place man in a privileged rela- tion to Being, one that is based on difference from the animal. Molloy’s violence  undermines any such claims for an essential difference between the human and  the animal. Indeed as Beckett sarcastically observed in “Les peintures des van  Veldes,” it is precisely in times of great massacres that the claim for the human  is most loudly heard. And just as in that essay, where the flow of sheep’s urine  was a symbol of the limits of the human capacity to represent time, in Molloy the  return to animality symbolizes the limits of the human capacity to resist the urge  towards violence. Only in moving beyond such oppositions, Molloy suggests, and  by accepting the limited capacity of the human animal, could such violence be  potentially overcome. concLusion Molloy’s descent into the mud of animality is the beginning of a long process  of decomposition that the voice of How It Is will look back on, remembering “I  was young I clung on to the species we’re talking of the species the human” (39).  The phrasing here almost exactly recalls the text of “Le peinture des van Veldes,”  with its call “let us speak of the human.” This textual echo points to how it was  in Beckett’s engagement with painting that he first developed this questioning of  the human, showing the centrality of the visual arts to Beckett’s work in ways that  go beyond iconographical and textual references. This engagement with paint- ing also enabled Beckett to participate, however obliquely, in the wider political,  philosophical, and aesthetic debates of post-war France. And given that Beckett’s  contemporaries in these debates were figures such as Sartre, Merleau-Ponty,  and Heidegger, it is in Beckett’s engagement with painting that historicist and  theoretical approaches to Beckett’s work can be reconciled (see Rabaté 699–702),  for it indicates that Beckett’s work belongs to the history of theory. For Beckett  in “Le peinture des van Veldes,” a painting begins as a “non-sens” (“non-sense”)  (Disjecta 119) into which a whole history of interpretation, criticism and desire is  inscribed, and for the Beckett writing in post-war France, what he chose to see  on the canvas was, as he wrote of his experience working with the Red Cross in  Saint-Lô, “a vision of a time honoured conception of humanity in ruins” (“The  Capital of the Ruins” 279). </page> <page sequence="17"> Beckett, Painting and the “Human” 97 Notes 1.
