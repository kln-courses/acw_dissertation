XX + 264, 8 pls. This is the first volume in a new series from the Netherlands devoted to Greek and Roman religion. As the title Pietas suggests, it is in part a homage paid by the present influential generation of Dutch religious historians to the man whose inspiration (if not direct teaching) lies behind their work-Hendrik Wagenvoort. Graduating in I9IO and reaching a chair of Latin in I924, W. enjoyed a productive career of over 6o years and was active very nearly up to the time of his death at the age of 89. The occasion of his retirement from the University of Utrecht in I956 was marked by the publication of a collection of his essays, Studies in Roman Literature, Culture and Religion, and this present volume, in a sense, supplements that. It includes some early pieces omitted from the Studies and eight essays that have appeared more recently, ending with his last major statement on Roman religious history, ' Characteristic Traits of Ancient Roman Religion', from Aufstieg und Niedergang I, 2. All of these are conveniently translated into English from the Dutch, French, German or Latin of the original versions. Despite an apparently wide diversity of subject matter and some useful linguistic studies, one major proposition, familiar from W.'s other works, stands out from the collection as a whole: namely, that in the language and conservative ritual of Rome in the historical period we may still identify traces of a primitive ' dynamistic ' conception of supernatural power, an impersonal force thought to lie within (and hence explain) the unpredictable operation of nature or the remarkable talents of outstanding men. This theory is better known in England through the work of H. J. Rose and, although WV. diverges in some details from his British counterpart, very similar themes are found in the writing of both: comparisons of the impersonal force supposedly revered by the early Romans with the mana of the Polynesians or the orenda of the Iroquois; the suggestion that the word numen might represent the Latin equivalent of these ethnographic terms; speculation as to how the more familiar anthropomorphic deities might in some cases have developed out of earlier ' numinous ' notions. Of course, as with most theories on the origins of Roman religion, these views never gained universal assent and both Rose and W. (see, especially, pp. 39 ff. and 247 ff.) devoted much time to their defence. Sometimes this was easily successful, as part of the criticism was blindly directed against any use of comparative ethnography in the study of Roman religion. In other areas, however, they met more serious opposition. Both Georges Dumezil (e.g. Rev. Phil. 26 (I952), 7 ff.) and, more politely, Stefan Weinstock (e.g. JRS 39 (I949), i66 f.) produced powerful and cogent arguments against the simple identification of the Latin numen with Polynesian mana and even against the usefulness of suggesting a primitive non-anthropomorphic strand in Roman religion at all; and, in the event, although victory was never conceded by either Rose or W., these latter opponents (without producing any necessarily convincing alternative hypothesis) won the day in their destruction of the dynamistic model. If with hindsight we may judge that W.'s central theory failed to convince, we cannot for that reason dismiss this collection as without value. For it is clearly of contemporary importance that the other side of the long-running dispute between Dumezil and W. should be more readily accessible. Indeed we can now see much more easily what a formidable opponent W. was, and what a trenchant defender of his own position. In reply to the often intemperate attacks of the French scholar, he could ' give as good as he got' and he supported the ultimately losing cause with a spirit, intelligence and intellectual openness not found in many of his allies. Though his eventual defeat was deserved, it is surely that intellectual openness that inspired so many of the younger generation of Dutch religious historians-and for this we should certainly be grateful.
