E Sharpe, Inc., 1990 SCREENING FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL MATURITY BEFORE ADMISSION TO PRIMARY SCHOOL CHRISTO CHRISTOZOV AND SYLVIA PETROVA The physical and mental development of children is a complex, continuous, but irregular process of qualitative accumulations and quantitative reorganizations of the organism prompted by the in- teraction of internal, biological forces and external, mainly social influences. Six to seven years of age is considered the stage of de- velopment at which the organism has achieved the biological, men- tal, and social maturity necessary for the child to undertake school- work - and at which certain disturbances become more clearly determinable [1-3]. The purpose of screening six-seven-year-old children before ad- mission to school is to assess their readiness for school on the basis of standardized procedures that produce objective and comparable results. Such screening, if linked with clinical considerations, also affords an opportunity to make precise clinical diagnoses and to select appropriate medico-pedagogical interventions. Material and methods A complex program for assessing the school-readiness of six-seven-year-old children has been introduced in Bulgaria [4]. The authors are associated with the Department of Psychiatry, Medical Acad- emy, Sofia 14/31, Bulgaria. This paper was presented at the 8th World Congress of the International Associ- ation for the Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency, held in Dublin, Ireland, in August 1988. 73</page><page sequence="2">CHRISTO CHRISTOZOV &amp; SYLVIA PETROVA The procedures used include calculation of ten indices that give the level of anthropometric, somatomorphological, and mental de- velopment according to established age norms. The results of the assessment of every index are presented in the form of three-step scales (scores of 3, 2, or 1), and the mean of all the scores yields the "overall assessment score," which falls into one of three cate- gories: mature, of average maturity, or immature in terms of readi- ness for school. A group of 115 6-year-old children from the small town of Novy Iscar-Sofîa - 55 (47.8%) boys and 60 (52.2%) girls - was examined in March 1986. The examinations were conducted by a team con- sisting of a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Results Our findings are summarized in the accompanying table. The anthropometric indices weight and height (Nos. 1 and 2) of most of the children fell within the middle range (75.6% and 65.2%), and the "accelerated" and "retarded" groups were almost symmetrically distributed on the Gaus's curve. The difference be- tween the immature group and those of average maturity was sig- nificant (P &lt;0.001), and the findings for our group were consider- ably higher than those obtained by D. Batoeva (7.33% and 10.85%) [5]. About a third of the children (33.9% and 32.2%) fell within the "immature" category in terms of the somatomorphological indices (Nos. 3 and 4). This may reflect either little reliability of the in- dices or actual morphological immaturity. We found no other study results with which we could compare ours. On the psychological indices (Nos. 5-10), the findings on index No. 5, school readiness, as measured by a modified version of the Austrian Karas-Seyfried test, were particularly interesting: 40% of the children were in the "immature" group. This indicates that a considerable proportion of the children did not meet the specified "school maturity" criteria. A possible explanation of this finding is either the greater subjectivity of the assessment in this test com- pared with other subtests or the greater demands in the instruc- tions for determining school readiness [4], which may not correlate with what is possible at this age. The subtests "attention stability" (Bourdon test, as modified 74</page><page sequence="3">SCREENING FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL MATURITY Results of Assessment of School-Readiness "Of average "Mature" maturity "Immature" (score-3) (score-2) (score-1) No. Index Number % Number % Number % 1.

Batoeva), and "mathematical ideas" (operating with numbers as ideas) indicate that the highest proportion of the children fell within the "mature" subgroup. This finding reflects a good level of development of "intellectual preparedness" and the quality of the pedagogical work in our kindergartens (9th sub- test). On the subtests "motor memory" (modified version of the Herbert-Winckler test) and "native language," most of the chil- dren displayed "medium" levels of development, which are linked to the more moderate rate of maturation of fine motor skills at this age and to some sociocultural characteristics of the region. The figure presents a comparison of the sexes in the "immature" subgroup in terms of the various indices. It can be seen that the anthropomorphic immaturity of the girls is greater than that of the boys, but the difference is not significant (P &gt;0.05). The opposite tendency is observed on the psychological tests, which reveal greater immaturity of the boys, especially on the 5th and 9th tests, on which the differences are significant (P &lt;0.01 and P &lt;0.05, respectively).

In the last group there were 16 boys (29%) and 8 girls (13.3%), giving a sex ratio of 2.18:1. The difference was sig- nificant (P &lt;0.05). The clinical investigation revealed that 32 children (27.8%) had a more or less evident dyslalic disorder, the sex ratio being 21 boys to 11 girls, or 38.1% compared with 18.33%, the difference being significant (P &lt;0.05). The distribution of these children according to the three subgroups was: 18, "mature"; 5, "of average maturity"; and 9, "immature." The relative weight of the dyslalic children in the "immature" group was 1.41 times greater than in the first and second subgroups together (by comparison, Batoeva found that 10.0% of the children in his study group were dyslalic). In addition, 4 children (3.4%) were found to be neurotic; 2 (1.7%), to have psychophysical infantilism; 2 (1.7%), to have articulation difficulties; 1 (0.86%), to have rhinolalia; 1, to be hy- peractive; and 1, to suffer from daytime and nighttime enuresis. In general, clinically significant conditions were observed in 11 (9.56%) children, and these children will need additional clinical investigation and care. Conclusion Complex assessment of the school-readiness of six-year-old chil- dren gave us an opportunity to determine their level of develop- ment and to formulate intervention programs where indicated. A result of practical importance was the possibility of detecting some pathological conditions that required medical and medico- pedagogical care. It was recommended that the children assessed as "immature" begin school at a somewhat later age. References 1. Kovalev, V. V. (1977) [Psychiatry of childhood (A handbook for physicians)].
