The number of works preserved is not small, especially taking into account that they belong to a very early period of the history of al-Andalus. There may still be surprises as regards the discovery of manuscripts of unknown works (as in the case of cAbd al-Malik b. Habib's Kitãb wasf al-f ir daws, a work not mentioned in the sources) or works considered lost (as in the case of the two Risãla- s by Ibn Masarra). Works written in the 3rd/9th century, apart from their interest for the study of the genre to which they belong (medicine, history, eschatology, figh, hadïth , treatises against innovations, süfism ), allow us to reconstruct the intellectual and religious atmosphere of the times in which they were written. In this article, I will attempt to reconstruct some of the religious beliefs and practices existing in al- Andalus during the 3rd/9th century 27 , using material mainly from Ibn Waddah's works and transmissions.

Asín Palacios. 27 For a general overview see now M. Marín, Individuo y sociedad en al-Andalus (Madrid, 1992).</page><page sequence="4">18 Maribel Fierro [4] the Andalusian intellectual milieu of his time has been emphasized in several studies 28, thus being the obvious choice for such an endeavour. 1. Theology: the vision of God in the afterlife. 1.1. There is evidence of activity in the field of theology in al-Andalus during the 3rd/9th century. Before cAbd al-Rahmãn II's death in the year 238/852, an Andalusian, cAbd al-Aclã b. Wahb (d. 261/874), was accused of devoting attention to theology ( kalãm ), of reading the books of the Muctazilites, of being a qadari and of maintaining that spirits (arwãh) die29. The Kitãb wasf al- fir daw s now shows that, on that point of doctrine (death of the spirits), cAbd al-Aclã was op- posed to cAbd al-Malik b. Habib 30. The latter, in fact, maintained that souls ( al - an fus) and spirits ( al-arwãh ) did not die with the bodies 31. Ibn Habib went as far as saying that whoever states that souls and spiritis die is either ignorant or a lindïq kãfir mukadhdhib 32 . It is worth recalling that the accusation made by the famous Malik! scholar Yahyã b. Yahyã (the transmitter of Mãlik b. Anas' Muwatta') against cAbd al-Aclã b. Wahb, during the reign of cAbd al-Rahmãn II, was an accusation of zandaqa which, fortunately for cAbd al-Aclã, did not lead to a trial or social ostracism. Ibn Hablb's text allows us now to formulate the hypothesis that such an accusation was made in order to attack specifically cAbd al-Aclã's doctrine on the death of spirits. As regards the second half of the 3rd/9th century, the cases of Khalll al-Ghafla, Ibn al-Samlna and others clearly show the introduction of Muctazilism in al-Andalus 33 . The sources state that cAbd al-Aclã 28 See the bibliography given in the study that accompanies my edition of his Kitãb al-bida c, as well as Isabel Fierro, «The introduction of hadtth in al-Andalus (2nd/8th-3rd/9th centuries)», Der Islam LXVI (1988), pp. 68-93. See also M. Marín, «La transmisión del saber en al-Andalus (hasta 300/912)», Al-Qantara VIII (1987), pp. 87-98, especially p. 93. 29 See Ma I. FIERRO, La heterodoxia en al-Andalus durante el periodo omeya (Madrid, 1987), pp. 49-53, section 5.4. It would seem that cAbd al-Aclã was influenced by the doctrines of Abü 1- Hudhayl al-cAllãf (d. 226/840): see the reconstruction of some aspects of his doctrines in R.M. Frank, The metaphysics of created being according to Abü l-Hudhayl al-cAllaf. A philosophical study of the earliest kalãm (Leiden, 1966), especially p. 27, note 2. 30 On the problematic relationships between these two scholars see Fierro, Heterodoxia , appendix I. 31 See Ibn HABIB, Kitãb wasf al-firdaws , pp. 99-105, n. 252-256. In the 5th/ 1 1th century, Makkï b. Abr Tãlib (d. 437/1045), a scholar from Qayrawãn settled in al-Andalus, wrote a (lost) tract entitled Kitãb ikhtilãf al-culama' ft l-nafs wa-1-rüh , where he might have mentioned the diver- gent positions of Ibn Wahb and Ibn Habrb. 32 Kitab wasf al-firdaws, p. 102. 33 See Fierro, Heterodoxia , pp. 91-3, section 6.4; pp. 111-113, section 7.4.; pp. 113-118, section 7.5. For the qadarism of cAbd Allah b. Masarra (the father of the famous Ibn Masarra) see now IBN HãRITH AL-KhushanI, Akhbãr al-fuqahã' wa-l-muhaddithin , n. 279.</page><page sequence="5">[5] Religious beliefs and practices in al-Andalus in the third/ninth century 19 b. Wahb was also an ascetic (zãhid) 34. The same combination of ascetism and in- terest in theology 35 is found in the case of the famous Ibn Masarra (d. 319/931), presented in the sources as holding Muctazill doctrines. The biographical dic- tionaries describe some Andalusian scholars as ahi al-hujja wa-l-nazar , an expres- sion employed in the Eastern Muslim lands for the Muctazilites 36. Although it would be necessary to assess exactly the meaning of such an expression in the An- dalusian context 37 , it seems safe to conclude that it refers to the existence in al- Andalus of scholars who used rational speculative methods. What I call the first theological discussion in al-Andalus is contained in the story of the trial for blasphemy involving Hãrõn b. Habib (cAbd al-Malik's b. Hablb's brother), which took place during the reign of cAbd al-Rahmãn II 38, a trial that seems to have led merely to Härün's imprisonment and corporal punish- ment. This first theological discussion dealt with the issue of God's justice and in- justice ( al-tacdrl wa-l-tajwfr) 39: one of the two alleged blasphemies pronounced by Hãrõn b. Habib consisted in his complaining of the pain suffered during a sick- ness, saying that it had been so severe that, had he killed the first two caliphs of Islam (Abu Bakr and cUmar), he would not have deserved such punishment. This complaint was interpreted as an utterance against God for having brought him un- deserved suffering 40. Hãrun b. Habib is said to have been interested in kalãm. He lived in Elvira, a town which seems to have had important Jewish and Chris- 34 See now Ibn HArith al-KhushanT, Akhbãr al-fuqahã' wa-l-muhaddithïn , n. 333, where it is said that he followed the example of Abü Hãzim and other ascetics in admonishing and con- tradicting rulers.

The origins of kaläm in Islam have been explained as a result of the polemics between Muslims and the believers in the other religions 41 . Härün b. Habrb was also a contemporary of the Mozarabs who voluntarily sought martyrdom by publicly insulting the Prophet 42 . Some kind of discussion between Muslims and Christians undoubtedly took place in al-Andalus in the early pe- riod 43 , but the information given by the sources is scarce. The normal situation would have been that of mutual ignorance among the different religious com- munities. In al-Fazãrfs (d. 188/804) Kitãb al-siyar , a work introduced by Ibn Waddãh into al-Andalus 44, there is a text where al-Fazârï is asked what should be done with the religious books ( masãhif) found in the land of the Christians (Rüm): to sell or to burn them. Al-Fazari's answer is that it would be best to bury them, but never sell them because their content is polytheism (shirk) 45 . If this were the doctrine adopted in al-Andalus, the little curiosity shown in the Arabic sources towards the indigenous Christian community is not surprising, such that even a scholar like Ibn Hazm (d. 456/1064) usually describes the doctrines of the Chris- tians according to what he had read and not according to what he could see among the Mozarabs of his own time 46. In the field of theology, as in others, al-Andalus in the 3rd/9th century fol- lowed developments taking place in the East 47 , without making any original con- 41 See S. Stroumsa, «The signs of prophecy: the emergence and early development of a theme in Arabic theological literature», Harvard Theological Review 78 (1985), pp. 101-114. Cf. J.

The Making of an Image (Edinburgh, 1960), pp. 5-6. Ibn Waddãh is said to have discussed with a Christian the alteration ( tahdïî) of the Sacred Books: see Kitãb al-bidac (study), p. 38, section 4.5. 44 See Kitãb al-bidac (study), p. 43. On al-Fazãrl, see GAS , I, 292. The Kitãb al-siyar has been edited by Färüq Hamãda (Beirut: Mu'assasat al-Risãla, 1408/1987). Ibn Waddãh is not a mere transmitter, but he adds some material not coming from al-Fazãrl (see for example pp. 179- 180). This feature is characteristic of many compilations, and it appears, for example, in the Kitãb al-bidac , whose transmitter from Ibn Waddãh also added material of a different provenance. 45 Op. cit., pp. 118-119.

At the same time that kalãm was being introduced, an open mistrust of it was also introduced, as can be seen in Ibn Waddäh's Kitãb al-bidac 48 and as is shown in an interesting anecdote, preserved in the Kitãb al-cãqiba by the An- dalusian Ibn al-Kharrãt (d. 581/1186) 49: «There was in Córdoba an ascetic muhtasib called Abü Marwãn 50, a pious and virtuous person who studied religious knowledge and transmitted hadfth. He studied with Muhammad b. Waddãh and settled with him until he died (wa-sakana cindahu). Ibn Waddãh said the funeral prayer over him and buried him in the cemetery called Halãl, also called "the cemetery of the poor" (maqbarat al-masãkín ) 51. From then onwards, whenever Ibn Waddãh had to attend a funeral in that cemetery, he visited Abu Marwän's grave, remained beside it, greeted him and pronounced the invocation over him. One day when Ibn Waddãh had to attend a funeral there, someone rushed him, so that he had no time to visit Abü Marwän's grave as usual. Ibn Waddãh said: "When the night came, I saw Abü Marwãn in dreams, telling me: "¡Oh, Abü cAbd Allãh ! , before, when you came to this cemetery, you used to stop near me, to greet me and make the invocation over me, and I was happy. But today you came and you did nothing of the sort". I asked him: "¡Oh, Abü Marwãn!, ¿can you (i.e., the dead) tell who stops near you and greets you?". He answered: "Yes. Your son Muhammad 52 sat on my grave today with a man, who was nothing other than a Jew, in order to talk with «the unification of Islamic thought and the flowering of theology in the 3rd century hejira, together with an historical summary of issues». The information is taken from an advertising leaflet; I have been unable to consult this work. 48 See Kitãb al-bidac (study), p. 101, notes 230 and 231. Works against kalãm and mutakallimün were written in the East, like cAbd Allah b. Muhammad al-Harawfs Dhamm al- kalãm wa-ahlihi , ms. in Zãhiriyya (see M.N. AL-AlbänT, al-Muntakhab min makhtütät al-hadîthy Damascus, 1970, p. 429, n. 719). 49 As far as I know, this work, a treatise on eschatology, is still unpublished. I have con- sulted the Leiden ms.

Cairo, 1955), no. 1776. Ibn al-Abbär states that his source is Ibn cAbd al-Barr (see note 13). Of this ascetic only the kuny a is known; a slightly later zãhid , Abü Wahb (d. 344/955), was refered to also by his kuny a, the rest of his nasab not being mentioned with the ex- ception of his ism y cAbd al-Rahmãn: see M.

The information on its being called also «the cemetery of the poor» seems to be new. 52 See Ma I. FIERRO, «Bazrc, mawlà de cAbd al-Rahmãn I, y sus descendientes», Al-Qantara VIII (1987), pp. 99-118, especially pp. 113-114. One the teachers of this son of Ibn Waddãh was Qãsim b. Muhammad, described by the sources as following the madhhab al-hujja wa-l-nazar.</page><page sequence="8">22 Marthel Fierro [8] about things which were nothing but infidelity {kufr)" . Ibn Waddãh said: "When I woke up, I called my son Muhammad and asked him: "Where did you sit when you attended the burial of so and so?". He answered: "Near the grave of Abü Marwãn, the ascetic". I asked him: "With whom did you sit?". He remained silent and I asked again. He said: "With so and so", telling me who he was. It was a man who held certain (theological) doctrines ( kãna yuzannu bi-bacd al-kalãm). I asked my son: "What did you talk about?". He answered: "We talked about God, the Qur'an and other things". I told him: «Oh, my son!, I already knew it, because Abü Marwãn came to me in my dreams and he told me everything». It is worth noting that the anonymous person who liked to discuss God and the Qur'an is described as a Jew by Abü Marwãn. He probably was not, but rather a Muslim. The description of him as a Jew is aimed at disqualifying him. As he tried to introduce young Muhammad to certain theological doctrines con- sidered suspect, he resembled more a Jew than a Muslim, in the same way that his doctrines were not Islamic. It is also worth noting that this anecdote has preserved one of the few examples of «miraculous» interventions by an Andalusian ascetic recorded in the sources 53 . 1.2. Among Ibn Waddäh's contributions to the intellectual development of al-Andalus, his activity as the introducer of works 54 and material from the East dealing especially with ascetism Jihãd and hadtth is important. In the field of theol- ogy, as I have already noted 55 , Ibn Waddãh dealt with the issue of the vision of God in the afterlife, that is, with the issue of whether the believer would see God at the Last Judgement and in Paradise. This issue was the subject of polemics in Islam because of its anthropomorfic implications. Ibn Waddãh wrote a Kitãb al-nazar ilã Allah tacãlã , mentioned by cIyãd in the biography devoted to him in Tartïb al- madãrik 56. With the title Kitãb fï-hi mã jä'a min al-hadïth fï l-nazar ilã Allãh , a fragment of Ibn Waddäh's work is preserved in Qayrawãn. Ziriklr, F. Sezgin and M. Muranyi gave notice of it 57 .

The first hadtth is transmitted by Jarïr b. cAbd Allah al-Bajalï. The transmissions of this Companion of the Prophet constitute the beginning of a work by Muhammad b. al-Husayn al- Ãjurrí (d. 360/970) 59, with a title similar to that of Ibn Waddâh's, Kitãb al-tasdïq bi-l-nazar ilã Allãh tacãlã ft l-ãkhira , also recently edited 60. The hadtth quoted by Ibn Waddãh is parallel to those quoted by al-Ajurrï 61 . Al-Ajurrï died some sixty years after Ibn Waddãh. This chronological proximity and the fact that both belonged to the group of the ahi al-hadtth allow us to suppose that the contents of their respective works must have been similar and in many cases the same. Al- Ajurrï quotes Qur'an 75: 22-23, as well as the tradition of the Prophet and the sayings of his Companions and the culamã' 62 . The number of transmissions col- lected by al-Ajurrï is sixty four. The Companions and Successors who transmitted traditions on the reality of the vision of God in the other life are: Abu Bakr (no. 19, 20, 21), Abü Hurayra (no. 27-31), Abü Sacïd al-Khudrï (no. 32-33, 57), Suhayb (no. 34-36), Abü Razïn al-cUqaylï (no. 37-38, 60), Abü Müsä al-Ashcarï (no. 39-41, 61, 62), cAbd Allãh b.

Hãtim al-Tâ'ï (no. 55-56), Hudhayfa (n. 22), al-Hasan al-Basrï (no. 1, 2, 15), Kacb al-Ahbãr (n. 3), Muhammad b.

As it happens in the case already mentioned of the trans- missions of Jarïr b. cAbd Allãh al-Bajalï, the other transmissions could have been known and quoted by Ibn Waddãh, as their isnãd- s show undoubtedly that they were circulating in his time 63.

Anas, quoted in al- Ajurrfs work (no. 4), and preserved by the Egyptian Mãlikí Ibn Wahb, in which the founder of the school states «the People will see God on the day of the Resur- rection with their own eyes». Al-Ajurri was not the only one who wrote a work on the vision of God in the other life 64 . The traditionists al-Dãraqutní (d. 385/995), Abü Nucaym (d. 430/1038) and al-Bayhaqí (d. 458/1066) also wrote such books, as did the mys- tics al-Muhãsibí (d. 243/857) 65 and Abü Sacíd b. al-Acrãbí (d. 341/953) 66, and the theologian al-Ashcarí (d. 324/935) in his Kitãb ft jawãz ru'uyat Allãh tacãlã bi-l-absãr 67 . In the Maghrib, apart from Ibn Waddãh, there were Yahyã b. cUmar (d. 289/902), an Andalusian established in Qayrawãn 68, and Abü 1- cArab al-Tamímí (d. 333/945) 69. Al-Ajurri wrote his book to instruct the ig- norant and to refute the Jahmis who rejected anthropomorphism and thus the possibility of God's being seen 70. Al-Ajurri believed, as a traditionist, that believers will see God with their own eyes in the afterlife, and Ibn Waddãh un- doubtedly believed the same. The theological doctrines of the traditionists have always been suspect of anthropomorphism 71 , a feature that can appear in their writings either explicitly or implicitly. An example of the latter case is the for- mula « walladht nafst bi-yadihi » («By Him who holds my soul in his hand», the hand being, of course, God's hand) found in so many early compilations of hadith like the Kitãb wasf al-firdaws by cAbd al-Malik b.

In Ibn Habib's work there are many references to God's hand and to the fact that believers will see Him in Paradise 73 . It has been said that the rejection of the vision of God would have weakened belief in the Last Judgement 74 . It has also been said that the popularity gained by the idea of the vision of God in the afterlife originated among murähitün , among those in charge of the defense of the Islamic territories and of expeditions into the enemy's lands: being exposed to death, they must have been comforted by the idea of seeing God in the hereafter 75 . Ibn Waddãh paid special attention to issues re- lated to jihãd' he introduced into al-Andalus Ibn al-Mubãrak's (d. 181/797) Kitãh fadl al-jihãd and al-Fazãrf s Kitãh al-siyar 76, as well as the Kitãh al-siyar by al-Walld b. Muslim can al-Awzâcï 77 . Al-Fazârï's work deals with the «law of war». In it we find jurisprudence on some of the issues that could arise during conflict against the unbelievers (to whom belongs what is found in the enemy's territory, the rescue of corpses, whether one should pray for the children who die in the dãr al-harh , whether monks and ambassadors should be killed, etc.). This interest in jihãd on the part of Ibn Waddãh might have arisen because of the frontier character of al- Andalus, but perhaps it was also influenced by Ibn Waddäh's social origins for he was the descendant of a slave soldier, and his paternal uncle, al-Hãrith b. Bazïc, was an important military commander on the Andalusian frontier 78. 2. Religious practices: performing prayer wearing sandals. 2.1. In my study of the religious practices condemned as innovations by Ibn Waddãh in his Kitãh al-bidacy I queried whether they were contemporary practices that existed in al-Andalus, given the fact that Ibn Waddãh never said they were and also that they were «old innovations», that is, practices which had been con- demned by scholars before Ibn Waddãh. The material I collected for that study led me to conclude that the selection made by Ibn Waddãh from the existing in- formation on specific innovations was determined by fact that he wanted to attack contemporary practices that either existed in al-Andalus and/or that he had seen during his travels to the East. This idea was confirmed when I discovered that one of the practices condemned by Ibn Waddãh, the so-called ittibãc ãthãr al-nabt («following the footsteps of the Prophet», i.e., going to pray at those places where 73 See op. cit., no. 140, 227, 228, 232, 233, 247. 74 Watt, art. cit ., p. 8. 75 See Muranyi, «Fragmente», p. 532. 76 The first work has been edited by Nazïh Hammãd (Beirut, 1391/1971); the second (see note 44) is preserved in the riwãya of Ibn Waddãh. 77 See Kitab al-bidac (study), p. 43. 78 See Fierro, «Bazic, mawlà de cAbd al-Rahman I», pp. 101-112.</page><page sequence="12">26 Marthel Fierro [12] the prophet had been known to pray, thus transforming them into sanctuaries), which in principle did not seem to have any relationship with al-Andalus, was a practice attributed to Ibn Masarra, who had built in his Andalusian house a replica of a room of one of the prophet's wives 79. I have found external evidence that the religious practices (cibãdãt) condemned by Ibn Waddãh were practices known in al-Andalus in the following cases: - the celebration of non-Islamic festivals 80, - the song-like recitation of the Qur'an (usually known as qira'a bi-1-alhãn 81 , - to raise one's hands and voice in the invocation 82 , - ittibãc ãthãr al-nabt 83 , - to exaggerate in the recitation of Qur'an 112: 1 84, - liberal spending on cAshürä' night 85 , - to prostrate in thanksgiving 86.

Ibn Waddâh's contemporaries, the Banü Hilãl, did not cook at all during the Christian festival of yannayr in order to differentiate themselves from the Christians: see clYÄD, Tartïb al-madãrik (8 vols., Rabat, s. a. -1983), IV, 429. 81 See Kitãb al-bidac (study), p. 107 and FlERRO, «The treatises against innovations ( kutub al-bidac )», Der Islam (forthcoming), section 2.1.1., where I show that there were qurrabi-1-alhãn in al-Andalus already in the 3rd/9th century. 82 See Kitab al-bidac (study), p. 108 and Ma I.

This practice can be taken as a precedent of the prayer called alfiyya or salât al-ragã'ib : see FlERRO, «The treatises against innovations», sections 2.3.2. and 2.3.3. 85 See Kitab al-bidac (study), pp. 113-4 and Ma I.

Another practice condemned by Ibn Waddãh was the exhumation of graves. Initially, I thought that, Ibn Waddãh being an Umayyad client, he thereby con- demned what the cAbbãsids had done to the graves of the Umayyads after their defeat 89. Now, reading al-Fazãrfs Kitãb al-siyar , preserved in the riwãya of Ibn- Waddãh, I have found a bäh nabsh qubürihim wa-l-rikãz («Chapter on the exhuma- tion of the enemy's graves and on the hidden treasure») 90, where the exhumation of graves is condemned while performing jihãd in dãr al-harb , in search of treasures. 2.2. Among the works written by Ibn Waddãh, there is one entitled Kitãb al- salãt fr l-naclayn. It is mentioned by cIyãd, as well as by al-Humaydr and al-Dabbr, thanks to whom we know that this work was still being transmitted in al-Andalus in the 5th/ 11th century. The issue at stake is whether Muslims should pray wear- ing sandals 91 . In a recent article on the duty incumbent upon Muslims of differentiating themselves from Jews and Christians (mukhãlafat ahi al-kitãb) 92, M.J. Kister has thoroughly examined this issue. Kister points that to wear sandals ( al-naclãn , al- nicãí) was considered a sign of high social position during the times of the Prophet. A tradition attributed to Muhammad states that God honoured the Mus- lims by allowing them to pray wearing sandals ( mimmã akrama Allãh bihi hãdhihi l-umma lubs nicãlihim fï salãtihim). Many traditions present the Prophet wearing his sandals during prayer. Companions and Successors of the Prophet, as well as scholars like Ibrâhïm al-NakhacI (d. 96/715), did the same. The practice is ex- plained as a means for Muslims to differentiate themselves from Jews, who used to pray barefoot ( khälifü l-yahüda fa-innahum lã yusallüna ft nicãlihim wa-lã ft khifãfihim) 93 . Kister considers that traditions which urge the differentiation from Jewish practice seem to belong to an early stage in the emergence of Islam, when it 88 See Kitab al-bidac (study), pp. 115-116. 89 See Kitab al-bidac (study), p. 116, note 344. 90 al-Fazan, Kitab al-siyar, pp. 101-108. 91 See Kitab al-bidac (study), p. 41, no. 4.

Kister, pp. 356-68, where the absence of unanimity on how Jews should pray (barefoot or wearing shoes) is mentioned.</page><page sequence="14">28 Maribel Fierro [14] was essential for the young Muslim community to establish its own characteristics in order not to be confused with the earlier religious communities. In this case, the practice of the Jews of Arabia would have been to pray barefoot, so that differen- tiation led Muslims to pray wearing sandals. Such prayer did not enjoy unanimity as can be seen in the contradictory transmissions preserved in the compilations of early hadïth , for example, in the material preserved in the Musannaf by cAbd al- Razzãq (d. 211/827) and Ibn Abl Shayba (d. 235/849) 94. The doctrine in favour of praying wearing sandals gradually lost favour, being substituted by the opposite doctrine, except in the case of the Hanbalïs, like Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya and Ibn Taymiyya 95 . The memory that there had been a time when it was considered licit to pray wearing sandals was lost, so that when some tried to revive the old practice by appearing in the mosques wearing sandals, they put their lives in danger, as their action was seen as an aggressive outrage. The abandonment of the old practice was determined, according to Kister, by «the significant changes in the social and material conditions oř life in the Muslim community: the sumptuous style of build- ing which characterized the congregational mosques, and the floors covered with carpets, called for the solemn prayers to be performed barefoot». Moreover, the Jews that Muslims met outside Arabia seem to have prayed wearing sandals 96 . What was the doctrine found in Ibn Waddäh's Kitãb al-salãt ft l-naclaynì In favour of wearing sandals or contrary? I do not know of any other extant work with such a title written by a contemporary of Ibn Waddãh that, as in the case of al- Ajurrfs work on the vision of God in the afterlife, would help us to reconstruct the doctrine of our Andalusian. The material collected by the traditionists cAbd al-Raz- zãq and Ibn Abï Shayba (the latter being one of the teachers of Ibn Waddãh) al- ready shows the diversity of existing opinions. The same happens with the material collected in the canonical compilations of hadïth , although Ibn Hanbal appears as the author who compiled more traditions favourable to al-salãt ft l-naclayn 97 . In my opinion, Ibn Waddäh's work probably contained contradictory material, i.e., for and against the practice of praying wearing sandals. However, I think that Ibn Waddãh must have been against such practice for the following reasons: - When Ibn Waddãh was writing his book, the predominant idea seems to have been that the correct way to perform prayer was to be barefoot. 94 See Kister, art. cit., pp. 340-344. See also Kitab al-bidac (study), p. 41, no. 4, where I mention the interest of cAbd al-Razzaq's and Ibn Abl Shayba's material. 95 See KlSTER, art. cit., p. 345 and Kitãb al-bidac (study), p. 41, note 240. 96 Kister, art. cit., pp. 345-349. 97 See A.J.

Anas prohibited governors to ascend the minbar of the Prophet in Medina wearing sandals, which seems to indicate that in general he must have been against the wearing of sandals in mosques 98. No mention is made of the issue of al- salãt ff l-naclayn in the two most important works of the Malik! school, Malik's Muwatta' and Sahnün's Mudawwana , a silence that I interpret as a sign of abandon- ment of the old practice. Ibn Waddãh was a traditionist, but he was foremost a MãlikL The fact that Ibn Waddãh wrote a work on this issue must have arisen from a polemical need. Maybe Andalusians prayed wearing sandals. Another possibility is that Ibn Waddãh was refuting a contemporary scholar who favoured al-salat fi l- naclayn. The most important opponent of Ibn Waddãh in al-Andalus was Baqï b. Makhlad. Although they both were united in having been the first to introduce cilm al-hadtth into the Peninsula, they were divided by the fact that Baqï was a «radical» traditionist, whereas Ibn Waddãh tried to reconcile Mãlikí doctrine with the doctrine of the ahí ai-hadfth ". What we know of Baql and his work shows that he must been very near to the doctrines of IbnHanbal and we have seen that he and later his followers were in favour of al-salat ft l-naclayn. Follow- ing this assumption, it would be not farfetched tu suppose that Ibn Waddãh wrote his book in order to counter Baqf s doctrine. Maybe one of the accusations made against Baqï, which led to his trial 10°, was that he was in favour of Muslims performing their prayer wearing sandals 101 . 3. Ascetism: the groups of ascetics. An interesting aspect of the ascetic trends that existed in al-Andalus during the 3rd/9th century 102 was the appearance of groups of «companions" (&lt; ikhwãn , ashãb) around some ascetics. This feature may have started with Ibn Waddãh. In some of the anecdotes intended to show Ibn Waddäh's virtues and merits, men- 98 See Ibn Abï Zayd, Kitãb al-jãmic (ed. M. Abu 1-Ajfãn and CU. Battíkh, Beirut/Tunis, 1402/1982), p. 140. However, Mãlik could only have forbidden governors to wear sandals on such occasions, while allowing believers to pray with sandals, in the same way that among the Jews there was one who said that «it is permissible to enter a synagogue wearing sandals; wearing sandals was only prohibited to (the priests) ascending their platform»: see the appendix by M.

Another pupil of Ibn Waddãh, Mãlik b. cAlï al-QurašI (d. 268/881) had companions ( ashãb ) who did not dare to raise their eyes to the sky out of fear of God. A third pupil of Ibn Waddãh, Abü 1-Qãsim Asbagh b. Mãlik (d. 299/911 or 304/916), is said to have had «companions like monks» ( kãna lahu ashãb ka-l-ruhbãn ), the sense of which seems to be that around him there was a community devoted to the ascetic life 106. The comparison of Asbagh b. Mâlik's companions with monks is striking. The Muslims of al-Andalus were familiar with Christian monasteries and monks. Asbagh b. Mãlik, a non -Arab, never left al-Andalus. It seems that he was highly considered as an ascetic in his birthplace, Cabra, before going to Cordoba, where he joined Ibn Waddãh. The latter had performed his first rihla to the East in order to collect information about ascetism and ascetics, so that after his return he became a pole of attraction for that kind of person. But although Ibn Waddãh ap- pears in the sources as Asbagh b. Mâlik's teacher, before that he used to visit Asbagh in Cabra attracted by his ascetism. Asbagh b. Mâlik's ascetism was thus prior to Ibn Waddäh's teaching and could have been born out of imitation of what he saw among Christians. On the other hand, without dismissing a direct in- fluence from Christianity, the appearance of «groups of ascetics» in al-Andalus may have received an impulse from what Ibn Waddãh learned about ascetism and ascetics during his stay in the East. In this direction, I want to draw attention to a specific aspect of Islamic piety. In his Muwatta' Mãlik devoted a chapter to al-mutahãbbãn ft-llãh , «those 103 See Kitãb al-bidac (study), p. 33, where I understood the term as refering to «real» brothers. M. Marin interprets it as «companions»: see the introduction to his edition of Ibn Bash- kuwäl's (d. 578/1183), Kitãb al-mustagïthïn bi-llãh (Madrid, 1991, FAH, 8), p. 70, but cf. p. 75. 104 See Ibn Hayyãn, al-Muqtabas V (ed. P. Chalmeta, F. Corriente and M. Subh, Madrid, 1979; transi. Ma J. Viguera and F. Corriente, Zaragoza, 1981), 11-12/26-7. See Marín, «Nómina», no. 1088, especially Ibn Härith al-KhushanT, Akhbar al- fuqahã' p. 192. 106 See Kitãb al-bidac (study), p. 61. To the biographies of Asbagh b. Mãlik mentioned in ibid. y p. 49, no. 57, one could now add the biography by Ibn Harith al-Jushanl, Akhbãr al-fuqahã' wa-l-muhaddithfn , no. 44, where it is said that Asbagh was very friendly and very hospitable with the pious, making his house a hubs for the ascetic and virtuous people.</page><page sequence="17">[17] Religious beliefs and practices in al-Andalus in the third/ ninth century 3 1 who love one another in God» 107 , who will obtain a special treatment and recom- pense on the Last day. The expression al-mutahäbbün ft-llãh is considered by I. Goldziher to be of Christian origin 108. Late authors, like the Andalusian al- Turtûshï (d. 520/1126) and Ibn Qudãma (d. 620/1223) devoted special works to «those who love one another in God» 109. Before them, cAbd al-Malik b. Habïb, a MãlikT, mentioned al-mutahähhün ft-llãh in his Kitãh wasf al-firdaws in two tradi- tions where special and extraordinary dwellings in Paradise are described, prepared for «those who love one another in God» 110. The merits attached to belonging to al-mutahähhün ft-llãh were also recorded by al-Muhâsibï (d. 243/857): «God's friends ( awliyã ') ... are companions in heaven because they have loved each other in their Lord in this world. They are briefly interrupted in their enjoyment for a vision of God» m. We have no evidence that, during his stay in the East, Ibn Waddãh contacted al-Muhâsibï 112, whose works seem to have been introduced in al-Andalus one century later, by Ahmad b. cAwn Allah (d. 378/988) and Muhammad b. Mufarrij (d. 380/990) 113. Nevertheless, and taking into ac- count that Ibn Waddãh performed his first rihla because of his interest on as- cetism, he might well have had knowledge of al-Muhãsibfs doctrines. However, the doctrine of al-mutahäbbün ft-llãh is still to be throughly studied and analyzed in order to establish which influence it may have had in the appearance of groups of ascetics. But if it actually played any role, in the case of al-Andalus its hypothetical influence would have arisen not only from its use by ascetics/mystics like al-Muhâsibï, but especially from the fact that the mutahähbün ft-llãh were praised in the Muwatta ' a work that had been circulating in the Peninsula at least since the first half of the 3rd/9th century 114. 107 See Muwatta riwaya of Yahya b.

These al-mutahäbbün ft-llãh are described as having as their main feature faces beaming with light. To this characteristic seems to refer the anecdote of the black whose skin, when he died, became white, mentioned by the Andalusian Ibn Muglth (d. 429/1037) in his Kitãb al-tahajjud and which is preserved in AL-DabbT, Bughyat al-mul- tamis (ed.

Conclusions. In the attempt at reconstructing the contents of two of Ibn Waddãh 's works, I did not wish to limit myself to adding to the information already available on the production of this famous Mãlikí scholar and traditionist, but rather contribute to deepening our knowledge of the intellectual and religious atmosphere existing in al-Andalus during the 3rd/9th century. My ultimate aim is to attempt reconstruct- ing what Andalusians knew, believed and practiced during a century from which we have inherited a small but important written legacy, made available to scholars in recent years. The conclusions that can be drawn from what has been studied are as follow: - Like cAbd al-Malik b. Habib, who was the teacher of Ibn Waddãh, the lat- ter believed in the vision of God in the afterlife 115 . The fact that Ibn Waddãh thought it necessary to write a work on this issue has to be understood as deter- mined by the existence in al-Andalus of people who refuted that doctrine, in the same way that the condemnation of certain innovations in the Kitãb al-bidac arose from their being practiced in the Iberian peninsula. In the second half of the 3rd/9th century, there were Andalusians who supported the doctrine of the vision of God and others who were against it. The latter must have belonged to the Muc' tazill circles that existed in al-Andalus. - A contemporary interest must also have led Ibn Waddãh to write his Kitãb al-salãt fï l-naclayn. It is my opinion that Ibn Waddãh must have been opposed to the practice of praying wearing sandals and that with his work he tried to refute the opposite doctrine which must have been known in al-Andalus. One possibility is that the Andalusians acted according to the practice of praying wearing sandals. Another possibility is that Baqï b. Makhlad, a traditionist very near to the Hanbalï doctrine, insisted that the correct way of praying was the wearing of san- dals, for which he could find abundant material in the early hadîth. I think the lat- ter possibility must be closer to reality, as trying to revive an abandoned practice fits well with what we know of Bail's activity and doctrine. - The existence of groups of pious people around a prestigious ascetic is at- tested already in the second half of the 3rd/9th century. In Asbagh b. Mälik's case, a direct Christian influence must not been dismissed. The role of his teacher Ibn Waddãh seems to have been important in the development of this trend. He had travelled to the East in order to collect material on ascetism and ascetics, was 115 The same belief in IBN HazM: see Abenházam , II, 60-61 and III, 239-241 {Polémica sobre la visibilidad de Dios) and Abü l-WalTd AL-BäjT (d. 474/1081), Sunan al-Sãlihín , ms. Leiden Or. 506, f. 395 (the same traditions as in al-Ãjurrl, no. 28-29 and 34-35).</page><page sequence="19">[19] Religious beliefs and practices in al-Andalus in the third/ ninth century 33 himself considered one of them and he appears to have been among the first in at- tracting around him a group of ascetics. Ibn Waddah's unquestioned orthodoxy must have been decisive in making those groups acceptable 116. I suggest the hypothesis that the doctrine of al-mutahãbbãn fí-llãh , mentioned by mystics like al-Muhâsibï, but also found in the hadfth and in the Muwatta ' must have been pivotal in giving support to the development of such groups.
