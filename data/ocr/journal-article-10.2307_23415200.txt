<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESPONSA OF R. YOM TOB SAHALON ON QUESTIONS OF FARMING IN HASBEYAH AND GALILEE by ITZHAK NISSIM After the Spanish expulsions, and the growth of the Jewish community in Eretz Yisrael, questions of Halakha relating to farming once more became practical issues. Apart from the "Mustarab" Jews (i.e. Arab Jews living in Palestine before the arrival of the Sefardim), there were but few Jews who earned their living from agriculture proper. There were a number of "devout" in Safed, however, who felt an obligation to engage in agricultural activity, "so as to fulfil the commandments connected with the Holy Land". Hence most of the responsa dealing with the sabbatical year refer to fruits grown during that year on Gentile land in Eretz Yisrael, and the question of their exemption from heave offering and tithe. All of them debate whether or not non-Jews have status as property-owners in Eretz Yisrael. Aside from these Hassidim, the last few indigenous settlers dwelling in border-areas skirting Eretz Yisrael still plied their hand at farming. The first responsum was sent to Hasbeyah on the slopes of Mount Hermon, just by the border of Eretz Yisrael. Some of the Jews there seem to have been prosperous grain-farmers, and one of them had sowed his land during the sabbatical year — apparently under the misapprehension that the sabbatical laws did not apply outside the borders of Eretz Yisrael. R. Yom Tob Sahalon decreed that the crop in question did indeed fall under the sabbatical laws. Many Jewish farmers in Eretz Yisrael used to lease fields from non-Jews and turn them over to Gentile tenant-farmers, or purchase oxen for plough ing with Gentile labourers, and seed for sowing, in return for which they would receive part of the crop. In his second responsum, Sahalon ruled that it was permissible to hire out animals to a non-Jew in the sabbatical year, whereas his colleague R. Suleiman Ohanna held that the Jew might not receive part of the crop, since this implied partnership with the non-Jew. The question of partnership with non-Jews also recurred in another context. [5]</page><page sequence="2">Was a Jew obliged to set aside heave-offering and tithe from that part of the crop which he received as payment from the Gentile ? Sahalon ruled that Gentiles had no status as property-owners in Eretz Yisrael, hence the Jew was deemed to have sown in soil owned by Jews, and was thus liable to tithe. R. SAMUEL BARZANI, LEADER OF KURDISTAN JEWRY by MEIR BENAYAHU Among the earliest Jewish communities in the diaspora were the communities of Kurdistan. The Torah flourished there from the times of the Geonim, but we know practically nothing about the communities after the 13th century. Were they really decimated, the Torah forgotten among them, and their ties with the Diaspora attenuated? Or did they continue to exist between the 13th and 17th centuries and the only reason that we do not know about them is that sources did not reach us? The documents published in this article, from the beginning of the 17th century, testify that several generations previously there were Rabbis in Kurdistan who had strong ties with Eretz Yisrael. The greatest of these was R. Samuel Barzani Adoni, who lived in the second half of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, and who spread Torah and knowledge in Kurdistan. R. Barzani lived in various places, his wanderings apparently being due to political circumstances. He maintained a yeshiva in Barzan, in 'Aqra, in Mosul and, towards the end of his life, in 'Ama'diya. He lived in staitened circumstances, and used the funds which he received from the Kurdistan com munities to support his yeshiva. He had no sons, only daughters. The most important of these was Asnat, who headed the yeshiva at Mosul, and who married one of the great Rabbis of Kurdistan, R. Jacob ben Abraham, her cousin. R. Samuel died between 1625—35 and was buried in 'Ama'diya. How did the Kurdistan communities recognize the authority of R. Barzani, and what was his influence on spiritual and social life? To answer this we must consider the sources of inspiration of this community in the 16th century. All that we know of its ties with other communities is that these existed with Baghdad, Aleppo and, particularly, Safed. Young men went to study [6]</page><page sequence="3">in the yeshivot of Safed, and the Rabbis of Kurdistan dispatched difficult questions of Halacha to the centre of Torah in Galilee. We do not know whether R. Samuel ever visited Safed, but there is no doubt that he accepted the authority of the sages of Safed and had ties with them. The study of the Torah in Kurdistan in his period was characterized by the spread of the Cabala•, actually, soon after the Cabala of "Ha'Ari" (R. Isaac Luria) was known it reached Kurdistan. R. Samuel's writings are filled with Cabala, and even his disciples engaged in the "secret wisdom." R. Barzani wielded tremendous influence. He was a master of explanation and persuasion and his very appearance won men's hearts. His chief enterprise was, without doubt, the dissemination of the Torah, which he accomplished in two ways: by establishing yeshivot and by sending letters of reproof and moral direction to the communities. His yeshivot served as centres of Torah and Judaism not only for his particular community, but for all Kurdistan. His disciples went out to teach near and far. They were the rabbis, the teachers, the cantors, and the ritual slaughterers. His most important pupil was R. Jacob ben R. Abraham, whom he designated to take his place. We do not know the method of study in his yeshivot. Undoubtedly the students learned to rule on points of Halacha, and there were those among them who made original contributions to rabbinic literature. In his letter to the Ma'ragha community mention is made of the fact that Mishna, Gemara, Ein Ya'acov and commentaries were studied in that community. R. Samuel was alert to every problem of the individual and the community. He sent letters of moral guidance and sermons of consolation to the com munities and stressed the importance of supporting the weak and the downtrod den. In his letters, which are written with great clarity and in afluent style, he sets forth the failings of the generation and the punishment to be expected. The communities obeyed his instructions and his regulations. He was the head of the Kurdistan Diaspora although never formally invested with this title. The Jews of Kurdistan regarded his personality as representing and uniting them. R. Barzani's interests went beyond the fields generallly accepted in his generation and region. In addition to Halacha and Cabala he also studied philosophical works. He wrote poetry, prayers, and liturgical poems, some of which were included in the prayer books of Kurdistan and were recited until [7]</page><page sequence="4">recent times. Of twenty liturgical poems, two prayers and four poems, only six have been published before; the rest are published for the first time in this article. He wrote many works, which were not published. Only one book, "Avnei Zikaron" which deals with the laws of shehita, has come down to us in its entirety in a large number of Mss. Of his book of sermons and his book of verses we have only remnants. His brother, R. Isaac, regarding whom this article also publishes new documents, was in some respects similar to R. Samuel and in some respects different. He, too, went from place to place to teach Torah, but he did not reach his brother's stature and did not write books as he did. After R. Samuel's death, he was succeeded by R. Jacob ben R. Abraham and apparently for that reason relations became strained between R. Isaac and him. The 'Ama'dia community even suspected that R. Isaac informed against him to the authorities, but R. Isaac strongly denied this. The historical sources in the writings of R. Samuel and R. Isaac give us a comprehensive picture of spiritual and social life in Kurdistan of their times, and even of periods before and after their own day. Kurdistan Jewry had been emptied of Torah. The actual rule was in the hands of the Shoter ("officers"). This situation R. Samuel attempted to change by bringing about a new attitude towards scholars and the Torah and establishing academies throughout the land. The Shoter ("officer") was elected or appointed, by a government official, from among the wealthy members of the community. Suitable candidates were not always available, and sometimes ignorant persons were selected who had no interest in matters of the spirit. The officer was in charge of tax col lection and represented the community before the governor. In addition, there were "elders," who functioned in the framework of the synagogue, and "wardens" (gabaim), who were subordinate to the elders. Individuals frequently shirked their share of the public burden. Philanthropy is emphasized throughout R. Samuel's work, and this is understandable considering the great need of the communities, in view of decrees and plagues, and the absence of men of great wealth. We find many warnings against talebearing to the authorities. The Jews had contact with their gentile neighbours. Friendship with the gentile sometimes served to give one a [8]</page><page sequence="5">superior position in society and made possible activities which could not be carried out without the help of the gentile. And against this R. Samuel warns. R. Samuel's letters, his messages of exhortation, his regulations and his prayers are a faithful reflection of various aspects of the life of the Kurdistan Jewry. R. MOSES ZAKUT'S EARLY YEARS by YOSEF MELKMAN R. Moses Zakut was one of the greatest of Italian sages, and one of the most important rabbis of his generation. Hitherto, no reliable information on his early years was available. The present writer has advanced proof that he was born shortly after 1610, apparently in Amsterdam. He studied at the local Talmud Torah, which his great-grandfather Moses Enrik Zakut had helped establish. In 1621 the family moved to Hamburg, but since there was no Beth Midrash in that city, Moses Zakut travelled to Poland. In 1642 he was living in Hamburg, and contemplating immigration to Eretz Yisrael. A year later he went to Venice, where he took to correcting Hebrew books as an occupation. R. SHALOM SHABAZI AND HIS POETRY by YEHUDA RASAHBI R. Shalom Shabazi, the greatest Yemenite poet of the XVII century, eventually took his place as the poet of Yemenite Jewry par excellence. His verses indicate a profound knowledge of the Torah and a wide general education. He was fully proficient in three languages — Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic — and wrote in all of them. Two of his works on astronomy and astrology have been preserved, but his main fields were poetry and liturgical verse. The influence of his poetic writings should be ascribed to the historical background of bis times, for be lived at a period when Jews suffered harsh restrictions and cruel oppression — such as the infamous "Muza' expulsions" which wiped out two-thirds of the Yemenite community — but when Messianic hopes and the advent of Shabetai Zvi left their mark. [9]</page><page sequence="6">Shabazi's poetry is a true mirror of the feelings of his generation — their sufferings and hopes of redemption. He himself was a figure of legend, and popular tradition represents him as a worker of miracles, who did wondrous deeds to save his fellow-Jews. Belief in his saintly powers, which could avail the sick and the unfortunate, persisted even after his death. His poetry was devoted to sacred themes : Knesset Yisrael, the Almighty, the Torah, the Messiah and the redemption, the world to come. Secular subjects, such as wine, love, nature, and descriptions of gardens and flowers, hardly ever occur. His songs of exile, in which he describes the lowly status of his own people beside the grandeur of their masters, are steeped in national pride. Israel, in all its poverty, is still the elect among the peoples of the world. His songs of redemption are the heart of his poetic writings, and it was they which made Yemenite Jewry accord him the same standing as Yehuda Halevi and Israel Najjara enjoyed in Spanish Jewry; his work indeed bears traces of the influence of the latter poets. His love for Zion, his longing for redemp tion and for the Messiah, for the upbuilding of land and people, find powerful expression in his verses. In his poetry of redemption he transcends gloomy realities, evoking a vision of the Tribes of Israel going up to their land, and describing the life of freedom and the bounteous plenty enjoyed by the nation in its own country, by contrast with its poverty and abasement in exile. Many of his songs are devoted to national and historical events from Israel's past: the lives of the Patriarchs, the Exodus from Egypt, the Giving of the Law, the Prophets, the Kingdom of David and Solomon. His nation's past grandeur is a source of faith and hope in the future restoration of its glories. As a religious poet, he devoted verses to the Sabbath, the festivals, and the ceremonies of wedding and circumcision. There was a marked didactic and moralizing element in Shabazi's per sonality, while Cabbala and mysticism found powerful expression in his writings. His cabbalistic verses were based on the Zohar, and on works of Cabbala from before the Ari's time. Scholastic and philosophical themes, drawn from mediaeval science, appear frequently in his poetry. Thus he dwells on intellectual and philosophical topics — creation, the origins of existence, the soul, the resurrection and the world to come — in the form cf questions sent to the sages of his day. Secular poems as such are very rare, and the most important of these are humorous [10]</page><page sequence="7">verses representing a polemic between inanimate objects of similar nature, written in Arabic for popular consumption. About half of his work is regional poetry, rich in changes of rhyme and rhythm, to fit the tempo of song and dance. His wide command of three languages enabled him to compose poems with stanzas alternating in Hebrew and Arabic, or Hebrew and Aramaic — not as virtuoso affectation, but as a normal mode of expression. His poems are not built around one single subject, nor do they present a continuous development; instead, a number of subjects appear concurrently. His style is marked by the absence both of Biblical metaphor and of the un dulating language of the poetry of the Spanish period. He uses the language of sages and scholars, simple and almost prosaic, a quality which endeared his verses to the hearts of the people. The wide range of ornate style so common in poetry of the Spanish period has no place in Shabazi's work. Some two hundred and fifty of his poems and piyyutim have been preserved, representing a quarter of all the Yemenite poetry that has come down to us. Of all the poets of his community, his verses are the most loved and best known ; he won wide acclaim even in his own lifetime. THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN R. SASPORTAS AND THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN LEGHORN (1681) by ALFREDO S. TOAFF The article describes the evolution of the autonomous judicature in the "Nazione Ebrea di Livorno" since its inception in 1593. The Chapter 25 of the "Livornina", the famous rescript by Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, inviting the Jews to Leghorn, granted them a lay tribunal, the Tribunal of the Massari, empowered to judge all civil suits among Jews and part of their criminal suits. This privilege, even while establishing that the lay tribunal had to judge as a general rule according to the Jewish law, did not recognize any judiciary power of the Rabbis. The Haskamah of the year 1655 bound the Jews to avail themselves of Din Israel only, as administered by the Tribunal of the Massari in 3 ways: "lefi ha-din", "qarob la-din" or according to its best judgement, i.e. the local com [11]</page><page sequence="8">mercial law. A later Haskamah, enacted in 1670 for the purpose of limiting to the early stages of the hearing the right of the parts to ask for Din Torah, is a definite proof that as rule the lay tribunal judged any commercial suit according to the laws and usages of the Port of Leghorn, unless expressly requested by one of the parts to pass judgement according to the Jewish law. In that case the legal proceedings were handed over to Rabbis, but their deci sions had no legal power until approved and published by the tribunal in accordance to the law of 1593. A revised code of Haskamoth, enacted in 1677, confirmed the Haskamah of 1670. Shortly afterwards the Massari and the Council of Twelve, in order to obviate the inconvenience and the frequent miscarriage of justice inherent in the possibility of one of the parts opting for Din Torah when losing a suit judged by commercial law, decided on a reform. They ruled that all suits pertaining to commercial and maritime law to be judged according to the commercial laws and usages of the Port, while matters pertaining to personal and religious laws had to be judged by Din Torah. These rules, however, because of the negative reaction they aroused, were never made com pulsory : they were simply not entered in the official Book of Haskamoth. Sasportas was then in Leghorn. About that time he had been a member of the rabbinical Commission of Issur ve-Etter and of the Yeshibah Kelalith. He was therefore aware of the judicial reform; nevertheless he refrained from action against it while in Leghorn. His violent attack started only when he was on his way to Amsterdam in 1681. The defense of the Parnassim. is contained in a manifesto in Spanish issued by the Rabbis of the Yeshiva, the Massari and the Council of Twelve. Following a circumstantial story of the strained relations between Hacham Sasportas and the Community authori ties, mostly on the ground of emoluments and standing, the cogent arguments in favour of the proposed judicial reform are set forth, together with the statement that, owing to the negative reaction aroused, its enforcement, which had already been postponed, would be forgone. The status quo existing in 1677 was therefore maintained and the position of the Din Torah in the autonomous judicature upheld up to 1808, when the French Imperial Governement, having annexed the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, abolished the Tribunal of the Massari together with all the Tuscan tribunals. [12]</page><page sequence="9">A NEW TEXT FROM THE BEGINNINGS OF THE DONMÀH SECT IN SALONICA by GERSHOM SCHOLEM All our knowledge to date about the first members of the Donmâh sect, who were converted to Islam and established a mystical group within it, is derived from the testimony of opponents, and from distant and confused echoes which have reached us from the last members of the sect. The discovery of this original document, published from manuscript 2262 of the Ben-Zvi Institute, is therefore to be welcomed. It adds to the other document from the same source published by the present writer (Tarbiz, Vol. 32, 1932, pp. 67—79). It is true that this document does not contain precise historical information. The mood reflects the rapid development of a legend. The author developed it on the basis of fantastic revelations he had. Most names of persons and localities are symbolic and the events described occured in the world of fantasy, but they reflect historical events, such as the conversion of the group. The latter is described as a concomitant of the war of the Redeemer and his part in the great battle between the Prince of Ishmael and his legions in heaven and the Prince of Edom and his legions. The statements of the text purport to come from the prophet Nathan of Gaza although they were written after his death. Its centre is in the imaginative story of the "disappearance" of the Messiah, that is of his death. Into this story the author introduced a kind of summary of events which actually took place after his death and that of Nathan. It is clear that the writer's aim is polemical : he opposes a new sub-sect which arose a few years after the mass conversion of 1683. The original values of the first group of apostates were holy in the author's eyes, and his opposition is directed towards the circle of Querido, the brother of Sabbatai Zevi's last wife, owing to the deviations from some elements of the original faith professed by the Donmâh. All this, apparently, was in order to return them to the bosom of the original sect. Querido died during a pilgrimage to Mecca around 1690. It follows that the present text was composed between 1690 and 1695. According to the author of the article, it is one of the basic documents of the Izmirli sect, one of the three sub-groups of the Donmâh. [13]</page><page sequence="10">THE NEHEMIA HIYA HAYON CONTROVERSY IN AMSTERDAM DOCUMENTS FROM THE ARCHIVES OF THE LOCAL PORTUGESE KEHILLA by ITZHAK SHMUEL EMMANUEL The archives of the Portugese kehilla in Amsterdam contain a number of documents in Spanish and Portugese on the controversy stirred up in that city by the Sefat Emet and the Leqet Haqemah of R. Moses Hages of Jerusalem, and the 'Oz Le'Elohim of Nehemia Hiya Hayon of Safed. A great deal is known concerning this affair, especially from the numerous polemics published at the time. However, the documents in these present manuscripts throw new light on the episode, and appear to be of value to the historian in determining the sequence of events correctly, and the part played by the hahamim and wardens therein. It will also be possible to make a more precise appraisal of the various personalities involved in the affair. 1. This is an opinion of R. Solomon De Oliviera and R. Solomon Aylion and their court, on the Sefat Emet of R. Moses Hages (Amsterdam 1707). They held that the author was excessively mordant in his references to the Amsterdam kehilla and wrote untruths. Hence the wardens pronounced a ban on reading or purchasing the book. 2. In 5467 Hages printed his Leqet Haqemah in Amsterdam, and slighted the wardens of Livorno, whereupon they complained to the wardens of Amsterdam. Haham Aylion and his court wrote a letter to the rabbis of Livorno in 1709, coming to his defence on all counts. The wardens supported him too, and wrote to the wardens of Livorno that they had examined their complaints, and found them baseless. Despite this, they summoned Hages before them; he undertook not to publish any book which might give grounds for further complaint. 3. Nehemia Hiya Hayon printed his 'Oz Le'Elohim in Berlin in the year 5473, coming to Amsterdam immediately after. He asked permission of the wardens there to distribute his book, and they handed it to R. Solomon Aylion for examination. The latter asked for another six people to join him on the panel, but before they could form their opinion Hages incited Haham Zvi to ban both book and author, and the two of them sent hasty messages to a large number [14]</page><page sequence="11">of kehillot to this effect, asking them to add their weight to the ban. The author is of the opinion that the precipitate action of these two rabbis in issuing their ban before the court had given its opinion only made the hahamim and wardens of Amsterdam rally to the support of Hayon and his book since their authority had been slighted. 4. The wardens of the Spanish community in Amsterdam were incensed at R. Jeuda Bariel of Mantua, who hastened to express an opinion on Hayon and his book without having read it, or heard the reasoned judgement of their court. R. Jeuda Bariel tendered his apologies, but did not change his mind. 5. They sent a second letter to R. Jeuda Bariel in the winter of 1714, com plaining that he had hastened to apply to Haham Zvi, whom they considered prejudiced and hence in no position to judge the book. They warned R. Bariel to cease writing to the Haham on this subject, and stop interfering in the affairs of their kehilla. 6. R. Jeuda Bariel published an eight-point list of questions on Hayon's book, R. Solomon Aylion and his court issued a reply in Portugese, which they duly sent him. In this they assert that most of Hayon's opponents had never read his book, and had taken Haham Zvi's opinion on trust. But Haham Zvi refused to withdraw, and so the wardens issued a strict injunction to the congregation to dissociate themselves from Haham Zvi and Hages. 10. A promulgation of the ban on the wealthy Abraham Senior, because of his support for Haham Zvi and R. Moses Hages. 11. R. Abraham Ischaqui, who came from Jerusalem to Amsterdam on a mission in the year 1712, joined Hayon's opponents and wrote to the wardens of the blasphemies he had encountered in his book. The wardens replied that they had found no fault in his conduct throughout his stay in Amsterdam, and there was not the slightest truth in what had been written about him. They were under the sole obligation to heed their own Haham and his court, and no other. 12. The letter sent by Hages from Emden, to the Souzas in Amsterdam, at the end of 1747, some two years after he had printed his Sheber Posheim, in which he wrote that he was suffering a great deal from the controversy, and that his opponent was victimizing him, apparently a reference to Aaron De Pinto, one of the wardens of Amsterdam. Now he wanted to make his peace with the kehilla. At that time it was customary not to rescind a ban unless [15]</page><page sequence="12">the person under the interdict first asked pardon from the rabbi. From this we conclude that Hages asked pardon from Haham Aylion, his adversary. In his introduction to the documents, Mr. Immanuel also deals with the relations between Haham Zvi and his Ashkenazi community in Amsterdam. The documents lead him to infer that these relations were strained even before the controversy arose over Hayon's book, nor did the community stand up for their rabbi afterwards either. He paid no heed to their authority. Most of the wardens would have preferred to see their rabbi quit his office, either because he remained against their wishes, or because his vanity and pretentiousness knew no bounds. The author then discusses Hages' activities in Amsterdam, and the attitude of R. Nunez Torrez to the Hayon controversy. This rabbi dared to print a criticism of the court in a special pamphlet, and said that the Meheimanuta Dekolla published by Hayon in his book was pure blasphemy. At the request of the community leaders, the court sent him a copy of the "manifesto", but he held to his opinion. Then they sent him a writ at the hand of a notary, to present himself before the court within eight days; but he never appeared. The wardens held that Nunez Torrez' pamphlet damaged relations within the congregation, and set people against each other. The court complied with the wardens' request and put the author under an interdict. In conclusion, the author adds some hitherto unpublished information on the life of R. Solomon Aylion, and on the wardens of the Portugese kehilla at the time of the controversy. The documents are printed in the original Portugese, with a Hebrew translation. PEDRO PEREIRA — JEWISH MERCHANT IN SURAT (INDIA), 1686—1721 by WALTER J. FISCHEL This study deals with Pedro Pereira and his Jewish associates, Antony do Porto, and his son John do Porto, and Fernando Mendez Henriquez, who in 1686 moved jointly from Amsterdam to Surat in order to participate in the lucrative Indian trade with Europe and to develop their own Jewish trading firm. The role which these early Jewish merchants in Surat played in the [16]</page><page sequence="13">export of diamonds and other commodities to Jewish merchants in London and Amsterdam, the methods of their commercial transaction, in close con• nection with the Dutch and English companies in Surat, the difficulties that they encountered, their trade with China — all this is outlined on the basis and in the light of hitherto unknown and unpublished sources, housed in the Dutch Archives, in the Haag, in the Indian Office, London and in the Archives and Record Offices in India. The commercial activities of Pedro Pereira, who was the moving spirit in this early Jewish merchant colony in Surat, brought him to the court of the Moghul emperor Aurangzeb (1689) in connection with the sale of diamonds. From the records we learn of Pereira's devotion to his native land, Holland, and also of his strong Jewish consciousness, his fight against all discrimination, and his defense of his fellow-Jews in Surat. Of particular interest is Pereira's association with Sir William Norris, the English ambassador of the East India Company (1700—1702), and the personal bonds of friendship between the English ambassador, and the Jewish merchant of Surat. It becomes evident that it was with Pedro Pereira that a permanent settlement of Jewish merchants hailing from various parts of the Jewish diaspora was established and that in his own time the Jewish community in Surat grew considerably, in number and influence. During the author's recent six-months stay in India as a Fulbright Research scholar, he collected new material on Surat in Jewish history during the 18th and 19th centuries, which will be presented in greater detail in his forthcoming English book on the Jews of India. THE HEBREW DOCUMENTS FROM THE CAIRO COMMUNITY ARCHIVES by ISRAEL BEN-ZE׳EB The Hebrew documents from the archives of the Cairo Jewish Community date from the past four hundred years, and number sixty-three all told. The earliest one is from 1561, and the latest from 1873, while most of them — forty-six — belong to a period of one hundred and thirty years between [17]</page><page sequence="14">1610 and 1740. The Hebrew, Arabic and Turkish documents, 549 in all, were classified and arranged by the present author on behalf of the Kehilla over the years 1932—39. Only two of the Hebrew documents had been published previously (C. 169, 347). Nine more are now published in the present article. This historical source-material tells us a great deal about commercial, economic, social and religious affairs over the period. We have a long list of rabbis, dayyanim, wardens and other communal functionaries, doctors, ordinary Jews of all social strata, and even a few women of note. We have information on the relations between the various synagogue congregations in Cairo and, in particular, on Jewish properties in half the streets and alleys of the Cairo ghetto. Of especial value are six documents (1—6) from the township of Mahalla el-Kubra, in the heart of the Nile Delta over one hundred kilometres north of Cairo. Four others (7—10) deal with the family affairs of the famous scholar, R. Haim Cafusi, and the remainder are title deeds and deeds of sale. The introduction also contains a detailed description of the remaining Hebrew documents which are still in the archives of the Kehilla, and to which we have no access for the time being. A PERSIAN TAFSIR OF THE PSALMS by EZRA ZION MELAMED In the present study, the author discusses a tafsir (translation) of the Psalms in manuscript form, of which three copies are to be found in the Ben Zvi Institute's collection, and one in his own possession. All four date from the XVIII and XIX centuries. Persian Jews had a very thorough acquaintance with the tafsir to the Pentateuch, and it was therefore never committed to writing; anyone versed in the tafsir could translate the Five Books by heart. But the Psalms were very rarely translated; hence their tafsir was committed to writing, and copies were quite common in Persia. Mr. Melamed's monograph deals mainly with the techniques of the transla tion, the influences at work on the writer, and his errors. The translator had his own method for rendering the names of the Deity, and like all Jewish Bible translators, he too endeavoured to avoid anthropomorphism. A number [18]</page><page sequence="15">of Hebrew words remained in the tafsir, a feature encountered with other Bible translators, as well. The author translated according to topic, analogy, or subject matter, paying no attention to verbal accuracy; here and there he followed the ketiv and not the qeri. In some places, by translating according to subject matter, he distorted the original meaning. Where the Biblical text elliptical or fragmentary, he sometimes filled in, if the poetic sense so indicated — a practice common to others before him. Here and there he expanded his translation, turning the tafsir into a Persian-language commentary. The Aramaic Tar gum, the legends of the sages, and the commentaries of Rashi and Ibn Ezra all left their mark on his tafsir. The translator made use of a Venetian printing-house, which had put out the Aramaic Targum; Persian Jews always preferred to print in Italy, as is well known. R. ABRAHAM BEN ASHER'S MISSION TO' ITALY by ABRAHAM I. KATSH R. Abraham ben Asher's mission came at a time when debt and calamity weighed heavy on the Jerusalem kehilla. Immigration had increased, and with it the demands of the Turkish Administration upon the Jews, whereupon ben Asher was asked to undertake a mission to Turkey and Western Europe. In the summer of 1741 he journeyed to Constantinople, and all we know of the route he followed subsequently may be summed up briefly thus: in 5502 he was in Bordeaux, in Nisan of 5503 he visited Livorno, in winter of 5504 Torino, and by 5509 he was back in Jerusalem. Correspondence between the emissary and R. Moses Hayyim Morpurgo of Ancona (1746—1750) in Ginzburg Ms. 1430, describes his activities in that community, and in Italy at large. In 1746 ben Asher was in Ancona, Rome, Senigalia, Venice and Siena, en route for Livorno, where emissaries would embark for Eretz Yisrael upon the termination of their mission. In 1748 ben Asher indeed brought his errand to a close in that city, and sailed for Constantinople. The correspondence also throws light on the important role played by emissaries from Eretz Yisrael in the life of the kehillot they visited, and the considerable authority they wielded at the time. נ 119</page><page sequence="16">THE JEWS IN HEBRON IN CHRISTIAN SOURCES by MICHAEL ISH-SHALOM Early Christian sources have little to say on the Jewish population of Hebron. Between the VII and XVII centuries, they mainly mention Jews visiting the Cave of Makhpelah. From the XVII and XVIII centuries we have some information aside from reports that Hebron Jews held their prayer services outside the Cave, that there was a small and wretched Jewish community in the town, which depended on aid from the Diaspora. The main substantial information dates from the XIX century, when the Jewish population startet to grew somewhat. Travellers dwell at length on Jewish households and their way of life, lauding the hospitality for which Hebron Jewry was noted. Missionaries — some of them converts — who visited Hebron, made no headway in their work among the Jews. Nevertheless they describe the sufferings of the Jewish Community under the various regimes, giving statistical data of the Jewish population at that period. The scattered items of informations are lacking in Hebrew sources, and therefore help to make up a general picture of the History of the Jewish Community in Hebron. All information contained in this article, is correlated by the author from previous known sources, and checked from the historical point of view. THE DIARY OF THE FIRST JEWISH SETTLER IN CALCUTTA R. SHALOM BEN OVADIA HACOHEN OF ALEPPO by ABRAHAM BEN-JACOB We have no report of Jewish settlement in Calcutta before the close of the XVIII century. The first Jew to settle there was Shalom ben Aharon Hacohen of Aram-Sova (Aleppo). Over the years 1784—1834 he kept a diary in which he noted details of his experiences and travels, told of people who came from Aleppo and Irak to India at that time, and described events and business affairs. Iiis diary is a unique source and hence of major significance.

Shalom Hacohen was born in Aleppo in 1762. On June 16 1789 he left for India via Bagdad, reaching Bombay on the 23rd of Ellul. A few weeks later he travelled on to Surat, a trade port in British India with a number of Jewish residents who had come on business during the XVIII century.

He returned to Surat after Pesach of the year 1752 and purchased a house, lie was a merchant by trade, and used to travel forth to the centres of the silk garment industry, or send agents on his behalf, and export the goods overseas. He amassed a large fortune, became friendly with the princely house, and the Rajah bestowed on him the great honour of letting him ride on the royal elephant. He built a synagogue called Neve Shalom in his name, bought a plot of land for a cemetery, and acted as Court Vizier to the Sultans of Lucknow and Punjab. At one time (1827) he lived in Chandernagore. Various important personalities are mentioned in his diary. Shalom ben Aharon had a daughter Rivka from his first wife, and four sons and five daughters from his second wife. He and his family paid frequent visits to various parts of the country, either on business or for pleasure and relaxation. The list of localities he visited includes: Allahabad, Benares, Bendil, Jinsrah, Dacca, Cawnpore, Lodiana, Madras, Ambarsar and Cochin. He died in 1836 and was buried in Calcutta. A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PUBLICATIONS CONCERNING LIBYAN JEWRY by ROBERT ATTAL Articles and studies on Libyan Jewry are few in number, scattered in various periodicals, and written in a number of languages, mainly Italian.

The number of items total 341, which are listed alphabetically by author. At the end of the list there are three indexes for subjects, places and names. [21]</page></plain_text>
