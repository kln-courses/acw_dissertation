<plain_text><page sequence="1">Director Ulrich Seidl Discovery Ulrich Seidl STEFAN GRISSEMANN INTRODUCES A NOTORIOUS A Seidl film , whether you like it or not, is impossi- ble to ignore. You know when you're watching one - it sticks out, like his latest, which conquered the largely mild-mannered, lukewarm Venice Film Festi- val a few months ago. Dog Days Ç Hundstage ), which won the jury's Grand Prize, is obscenely rich with memorable moments (e.g., a sadistic ritual in which a lit candle is stuck up a rapist's ass while he's forced to sing the Aus- trian national anthem) and extraordinary characters (such as the childlike hitchhiker who baffles drivers with indecent questions and motormouth recitations of useless top ten lists). It's an exorbitant slice of life from an overheated, sweaty Vienna, a city of sadness and hilarity, an infernal short- cut to a vision of desperation and pitiable grotesqueness. Director Ulrich Seidl, 49, is not without his suspect side. If Dog Days is a triumph, some of his other films have been decid- edly less successful. Animal Love (Tierische Liebe , 95) is a pretty empty series of illustrations of human isolation, handicapped by its cheap shots (homemade porn signifying existential hell) and rather simplistic views of life (anthropomorphism as the final stage of alienation). His TV work has ridiculed mod- ern art (Bilder einer Ausstellung, 96) and sensationalized petit bourgeois life (The Last Real Men/Die letzten Männer , 94). On the other hand, with his distinctively alien gaze Seidl is often capable of turning the everyday into cinematic suspense: Good News (90), a film about foreign newspaper vendors in Vienna, works in this manner, as do the desolate, iconoclastic would- be love story Losses to Be Expected (Mit Verlust ist zu rechnen , 92) and the interesting if less-than-fruitful Models (98). Seidl has never felt any inclination, however, to call his films documentaries , and rightly so. They are rather a wild blend of staged and "authentic" details, of the imaginary and the "real." Dog Days marks his belated feature debut, though in terms of his approach, very little has changed. "Dog Days Seidl says, "is a piece of pure fiction, but shot in semi-documentary style." The difference this time is that no one re-enacts their</page><page sequence="2">SURVEYOR OF THE GROTESQUELY 'REAL' own behavior and every role is completely fictitious. All the same, Seidl finds a way to circle back: his actors, an indis- tinguishable mixture of amateurs and professionals, at times found certain of their characters' traits familiar, and they ended up playing what they already knew , what came naturally; but they were not, he insists, playing themselves. Among Dog Daý s many fabulous performances, there are two standouts: Maria Hofstätter, a trained actress, is uncannily natural (and amazingly funny) as the mentally challenged hitchhiker; and Georg Friedrich, whose gutsy turn as a violent-sentimental guy heading for atonement rivals the meanest streetwise acting around. Seidl's modus operandi is complex. Scripts are forbid- den during shooting, and if his films seem to display a purely clinical fascination with his characters, at the same time they're bizarre demonstrations of affection. Seidl both mythologizes and dissects, indulges and exploits, those who work with him. It's hard to define precise boundaries. His films pose certain questions incessantly, and frequently touch on topics of both sociocultural and cinematic relevance: What is "real?" What is "normal?" What is "beautiful?" It may seem easy to dismiss the people in Seidl's films as monstrous or abnormal - but then why do even the most unbearable among them feel so familiar, so close? Seidl adamantly denies being a realist filmmaker: "I think my work is very artificial, strongly dependent on care- fully constructed imagery. I am not at all interested in sim- ply portraying reality." Seidl's crew describes his method as cre- ative chaos, a sort of "unplanned conception": not exactly know- ing where he's heading, yet very precise. This might explain why Dog Days took almost five years to complete. Seidl's penchant for creating tableaux vivants and fixing moving images in sustained moments of immobil- ity - a mannerism that's a little less evident in Dog Days than in most of his previous films - clearly demonstrates his aesthetic debt to photography. (He is often compared to Diane Arbus.) And though it may seem improbable on the face of it, Catholicism is also a major influence. Guilt and redemption are key themes, and there's a faint spirituality to his work that begins to emerge once you've come to terms with the obnoxious people who populate it. "As a boy I was set to become a priest," Seidl confesses. "I was an acolyte, not even questioning the path that would inevitably lead me to a clerical career. But during puberty I began to move away from the church, towards a more com- munist outlook. But a certain very basic Christian attitude has definitely stayed with me." Seidl reluctantly acknowledges the possibility of a moral side to his films. "Let me put it this way: If a painting by Hierony- mus Bosch is moral, then I guess my films are, too." It is, by the way, crucial to Seidl that his films be "radical." And, what's more: " physical ... so that one can truly, actually feel cinema."
