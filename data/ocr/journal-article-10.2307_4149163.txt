<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche's Honest Masks: From Truth to Nobility Beyond Good and Evil Paul E. Kirkland This article argues that Nietzsche uses a rhetorically modern appeal to enact the self-overcoming of modernity and the aim of enlightenment. It demonstrates how Nietzsche aims to move his readers from a prejudice in favor of truthfulness, by appearing to radicalize that aim, to a new measure of nobility. In contrast to some who present Nietzsche's styles as the means to convey a dispersion of meanings, this article argues that, designs his writing to move his age. He adopts the prejudices of his time in Beyond Good and Evil, his mature "critique of modernity" in order to demonstrate the self-overcoming of those prejudices. Beyond merely questioning the value of truth, Nietzsche evaluates by the measure of psychological strength, and describes the character of nobility beyond good and evil and beyond truth and falsity. Nietzsche is a writer of the rarest order; the explosive power of his writing is matched only by its subtlety. Even as he makes shockingly dramatic statements, he employs a familiar modern perspective in Beyond Good and Evil, presenting it in a grand style, as a prelude to exploding that perspective. In the voice of the free spirit, he writes as one who prefers the unvarnished truth to all other things even as he explicitly calls into question the value of truth. He appears to follow an enlightenment procedure of dispelling prejudices, but the chief prejudice he calls into question is that the truth is good. Simply rejecting this view would be a contradiction or it would undermine itself. Rather than viewing this paradox as a performative contradiction in Nietzsche's writing or the means to expose the instability of all meanings, I will argue that Nietzsche constructs his books in an orderly manner, designed strategically, rather than systematically, with a view to their rhetorical effect. Nietzsche's demonstration of the self-overcoming of honesty and freedom as ideals is political in its attention to what the age val- ues and his effort to move his readers and the age. His critique of objectivity not only raises questions about the possibility or desir- ability of truthfulness and demonstrates the self-contradiction of the enlightenment: it calls for a new responsibility for the effects of offering interpretations.</page><page sequence="2">576 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Nietzsche sought to dispel the very concept of objective truth, yet he continues to employ the figure of the free spirit, who would appear to seek freedom from illusions and even horizons. He dedicates Human, All Too Human to free spirits, offering it on the one hundredth anniversary of Voltaire's death, connecting it with the spirit of enlightenment, describing the book in Ecce Homo as the process of liberation from idealismI and in the 1886 preface2 as part of his experimental years on the path to "that mature freedom of the spirit which is fully as much self-mastery and discipline of the heart."3 On his own account, Nietzsche accomplishes the affirmative task in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, yet he returns to critique, No-saying, and the age in Beyond Good and Evil.4 Once again, the free spirit attains a prominent place, including a chapter and the perspective from which Nietzsche often speaks. This essay will consider Beyond Good and Evil as Nietzsche's mature demonstration of the self-overcoming of the type of the free spirit and with it the enlightenment mode of valuation. It will thus allow for a consideration of Nietzsche's rhetorical uses of the illusion of truthfulness. Attention to matters of Nietzsche's rhetoric and style have freed Nietzsche's work from Heidegger's interpretation of Nietzsche as "the last metaphysician" and an "inverted Platonist,"5 spawning the "new Nietzsche" who employs stylistic play to replace demands for truth and to avoid metaphysical enclosure.

Martin Heidegger's extremely influential interpretation of Nietzsche presents it as inverted Platonism that consummates Western metaphysics in the valorization of the will, rather than overcoming metaphysics. Heidegger presents Nietzsche's overturning of Plato as remaining within traditional dichotomies while privileging being over becoming. Martin Heidegger, Nietzsche, Volume I: The Will to Power as Art, trans. David Farrell Krell (New York: Harper Collions, 1991), esp. haps. 20-24. On Heidegger's view the overturning fails to overcome metaphysics, "Nietzsche holds this overturning of metaphysics to be the overcoming of metaphysics. But, every overturning of this kind remains only self-deluding entanglement in the Same that has become unknowable" (Martin Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche: God is Dead" in The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays, trans. by William Lovitt [New York: Harper and Row, 1977], p. 75). Heidegger thus suggests that Nietzsche does not live up to his aim of affirming life as it is that "lets Being be Being" (Heidegger, "Word," p. 104). On Heidegger's view, Nietzsche's metaphysics wills becoming as being and brings Western metaphysics to a close by bringing it full circle and leaving no remaining possibilities for the guiding question, the question of Being.</page><page sequence="3">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 577 claims that the styles do not conceal some deeper truth, but that the truth of Nietzsche's styles is in the undecidable play of the styles themselves.6 Sarah Kofman shows that for Nietzsche judgment is not between truth and falsehood, nor truth and mere appearance, but among appearances, recognized metaphors that are not guises for truth that is more fundamental, but part of a presentation that does not resort to metaphysics.7 For Gilles Deleuze, Nietzsche's writing is an enactment of laughter, play, and dance, a representa- tion of the life-affirming active principle.8 Commentators such as Derrida, Deleuze, and Kofman, see the multiplicity of Nietzsche's stylistic play as the escape from the metaphysical enclosure which Heidegger finds lurking in Nietzsche's "inverted Platonism." While these theorists see openness as the goal beyond metaphysical enclo- sures, the freedom pursued by the figure of the free spirit, it is not as clear that Nietzsche's multiplicity of styles remains in service of the goal of liberating manifold drives. 6. Derrida's treatment of Nietzsche's styles point to their disruption of metaphysical enclosure. For Derrida, a statement such as, "I have forgotten my umbrella" can be lifted from all contexts to indicate the undecidable play of Nietzsche's writing. In Spurs, Derrida writes, "Because it is structurally liberated from any living meaning, it is always possible that it means nothing at all or that it has no decidable meaning. There is no end to its parodying play of meaning... But not because it withholds some secret. Its secret is rather that it might have no secret, that it might only be pretending to be simulating some hidden truth within its folds" (Jacques Derrida, Spurs: Nietzsche's Styles, trans. Barbara Harlow [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978], pp.131-33). In this way, Derrida sees as the indication of the inability to close the meaning of a text or the interpretation of anything. Derrida concludes "that there is no 'totality' to Nietzsche's text, not even a fragmentary or aphoristic one" (Derrida, Spurs, p. 135). 7. Sarah Kofman, Nietzsche and Metaphor, trans. Duncan Large (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1993). Kofman shows that the interpretative status of all claims does not leave us incapable of judging among them. She writes, "The opposition is not between nakedness and dress, but between clothing woven by instinctive evaluations, which forms a perfect marriage with the contours of the body it cloths and thus reveals it, and a badly adapted clothing which travesties the person it covers" (p. 98). She argues, contrary to the Heideggerian interpretation, that Nietzsche succeeds in avoiding metaphysical claims by writing in metaphors. Viewing will to power as a metaphysical position, on Kofman's account, is the result of forgetting its status as metaphor. 8. Gilles Deleuze, Nietzsche and Philosophy, trans. Hugh Tomlinson (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983). Cf. Jacques Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play" in Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), p. 292. Derrida agues that "Nietzschean affirmation, that is the joyous affirmation of the play of the world and the innocence of becoming, the affirmation of the world of signs without fault, without truth, without origin, which is offered to an active interpretation" escapes the dependence on metaphysics of which Heidegger accuses Nietzsche and allows us to move beyond "the multiplicity of destructive discourses" that allow these destroyers to destroy each other reciprocally" (pp. 281-82).</page><page sequence="4">578 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Nietzsche's own "general remark about my art of style" presents the "meaning of every style" as the communication of "a state, an inward tension of pathos by means of signs, including the tempo of these signs," and his "most multifarious art of style" as the result of the "the multiplicity of inward states," which "is exceptionally large in my case."9 His general remark about style points to the particularity of all style; its particularity will follow from the inner state it seeks to communicate. Beyond the stylistic avoidance of metaphysical enclosure, Nietzsche's styles call attention to the spe- cific states he wishes to convey through the rhetorical strategies of his books. By contrast with Derrida and others who see Nietszche's multiplicity as an invitation to celebrating irreducible plurality of meanings and possibilities, Thiele recognizes style as the "creation of unity out of diversity."10 The production of style involves ordering their multiplicity, not the democratic liberation of each. Nietzsche does not simply write to explain his reasons, but to communicate an inward state, to move his readers. Nietzsche describes Beyond Good and Evil in Ecce Homo as a "critique of modernity."" The rhetorical procedure he employs allows this to be a self-critique of modernity as Beyond Good and Evil is also the book focused on "what lies near- est, the age, the around-us."12 Nietzsche employs the mask of the most thoroughgoing honesty, declaring the most terrible truths, seducing honest and superficial readers to believe that they have penetrated his secrets, which remain generally consistent with their own enlightenment, debunking spirit. Questioning honesty in the name of truth aims to move those attached to the enlight- enment prejudice that the truth is good, not only to see the harshness of the true, but to consider the value of untruth and to challenge the goodness of their own honesty. As Nietzsche demands "the value of the truth must be for once experimentally called into question,"'13 he uses the apparent preference for truth and its experimental method characteristic of modernity for the purpose of a critique of modernity, including the value of truth and the ideal of freedom. Focused on its own time, Beyond Good and Evil enacts a self-overcoming of modernity and the enlighten- ment prejudice in favor of truthfulness, and it will seek to provoke the experience of self-overcoming in its readers. 9.

In this way, Nietzsche will prepare those committed to freedom understood as liberation from prejudices for freedom understood as the capacity for command, self-command, and responsibility. Nietzsche employs a strategy demonstrating the self-overcoming of modernity's understanding of freedom. The free spirit's singular virtue of honesty will yield to the necessity of illusions. While truth and freedom initially appear as the objectives beyond good and evil, Nietzsche reveals the value of truth as another moral prejudice and the new aim, nobility, entailing a great deal of respon- sibility, emerges. Fully rejecting the presumption of the goodness of truth, Nietzsche's concern becomes the psychological state fostered by an interpretation. His rhetoric is directed not only to expose the claim of objectivity as yet another prejudice, but to demonstrate and promote psychological strength for judgments that do not take recourse in objectivity, but ground themselves in the health of one's disposition toward life. Beyond truth and falsity, Nietzsche introduces a new measure: The falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment; in this respect our new language may sound strangest. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, life-preserving, species- preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating.14 The measure of what is life-promoting will make possible judgments among illusions. Myths and perspectives will need to be evaluated by the measure of life. Due in large part to Nietzsche's influence direct and indirect, it is no longer surprising to claim that objectivity itself is a myth, yet another perspective which enframes the world. Yet much of post- Nietzschean thought has as a result faced a dilemma, for it has lost the capacity to account for itself in an intelligible manner. Objectively stating the impossibility of objectivity itself becomes a contradiction. It thus becomes difficult to speak in a clear and coherent manner. Alexander Nehamas finds the formation of a coherent whole on the model of a literary character, an artistic objective to be evaluated by its internal consistency, as the measure of success that lies beyond both objectivity and good and evil for Nietzsche.15 Derrida sees in Nietzsche's styles a sign of the indeterminacy of final meanings, and 14.

Such inclusive efforts, however, threaten to undermine all of the terms that might be used to justify any such demands for openness." While Nietzsche might be said to have begun all of these efforts (after all, he was the first to speak of the prejudice of grammar), he also points the way beyond the problems it leaves. If Nietzsche's view does not demand acceptance of his claims as final truths, he is left to show their superiority on some criterion other than truth. Nietzsche's rhetoric, consistent with his perspec- tivism,18 does not seek to undermine all judgments, but to open the path to new ways of evaluating among perspectives.19 His works 16. For Derrida the absence of authoritative interpretations calls for a questioning of all Being as an ethical and political task of openness to the alterity that is excluded in every authoritative determination. Consider Derrida, Writing and Difference, pp. 140-41. This procedure invites a political re-appropriation of Nietzsche's writing. Jacques Derrida, "Otobiographies: The Teaching of Nietzsche and the Politics of the Proper Name," trans. Peggy Kamuf in The Ear of the Other (Lincoln, NB: Bison Press, 1988), pp. 30-31. Here, Derrida declares his interpretations to be "political interventions in the political rewriting of the text and its destinations," which will combat the Nazi appropriation, not by showing where it is wrong, but by putting the text in the service of other effects. 17. Consider, for example, Jacques Derrida's treatment of democracy in The Politics of Friendship. Here, he seems to explain democracy as the perpetual openness to excluded others, a process infinite in its task and thus always in the future, "even where there is democracy, it never exists," thus belying the possibility of any definition of democracy. Defending such an indefinite notion in either theory or practice must collapse as soon as it decides what it will defend. See Jacques Derrida, The Politics of Friendship, trans. George Collins (London: Verso, 1997), pp. 304-306. 18. As Nehamas has shown, Nietzsche's perspectivism is not a self-refuting paradox, for saying that an interpretation may be false is not to say that it is false; considering a view as an interpretation is not to concede that it is false. Nehamas argues that Nietzsche avoids dogmatism because perspectivism does not demand acceptance as bedrock truth, but offers itself as a possibility ( Nehamas, Nietzsche, pp. 65-69). 19. Sarah Kofman shows that there is room between complete pluralism and dogmatism, arguing that the multiplicity of possible interpretations is not tantamount to the equivalence of all interpretations; some are more fitting than others; the value for life will permit judgment among them. Kofman shows that the metaphoric status of claims is not merely the avoidance of metaphysical finality, but places the value for life as the crucial criterion of judgment: "So between a complete pluralism of interpretations and the dogmatism of a unique text with an unequivocal meaning, there is room tor pluralism of meaning which are not all equivalent-equivalence being measured not by reference to a truth of being... but by reference to the value given to life by the one who is interpreting" (Kofman, Nietzsche and Metaphor, p. 141). This insight into the status of Nietzsche's own claims demands consideration of how Nietzsche understands what values life.</page><page sequence="7">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 581 show us the way to operate, to speak, and to make the judgments necessary for action, life, and politics where objective standards are lacking. As Tracy Strong shows that Nietzsche's claim that the moral worlds are illusions is not an argument against them, but that for Nietzsche, "truth" amounts to unquestioned created horizons, he shows the political character of Nietzsche's thought.20 Once the illusory task of positioning oneself beyond mere illusions is aban- doned in the face of nihilism, the task of philosophy becomes that of "great politics," transforming humanity by legislating values.21 Strong demonstrates that Nietzsche's understanding of the creation of values does not amount to mere subjectivity or cultural relativ- ism, but demands a rare capacity.22 Nietzsche also offers grounds for judging among views, grounded in human psychology rather than appeals to objective truth. Nietzsche uses the perspective of the myth of objectivity in order to display it as a prejudice, a myth that might not be very useful for life and to demonstrate its own self-overcoming. Beyond Good and Evil thus begins with a supposition about truth: "Sup- posing truth is a woman-what then?"23 It is not clear what we are to make of this provocative opening question, but it implies that the attainment of truth is not as direct or simple a matter as has been thought; the sequel clearly connects this to the elusive nature of truth, and its elusiveness to philosophers: "Are there not grounds for the suspicion that all philosophers, insofar as they were dogmatists, have been very inexpert about women?"24 Dogmatists--and we are already unclear on whether Nietzsche means us to think there have been any nondogmatic philoso- phers - are prevented from gaining truth because of something they fail to understand about women. When Nietzsche permits himself to speak of woman later in the book, he writes of the relation between woman and truth: But she does not want truth: what is truth to woman? From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than 20. Tracy Strong, Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of Transfiguration (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975), pp. 49-52. Where Nehamas sees self- formation on an artistic or literary mode, arguing that Nietzsche consistently draws his examples from literature (Nehamas, Nietzsche, pp. 226-28), Strong demonstrates that Nietzsche sees the task as no less than transforming "the stuff of humanity." 21.

Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">582 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS truth--her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty.25 Having identified woman with truth in the opening, Nietzsche sug- gests an opposition between woman and truth. If truth is a woman, are we to suppose that truth prefers appearance, beauty, and illusion to truth? The preference of truth for untruth creates the problem for those who have sought truth. At first, it sounds as if the trouble is that truth has so far been too elusive for philosophers (at least dogmatic philosophers) to catch. The nature of truth is to conceal itself, and not only to conceal but to beautify its appearance. Dogmatic philosophers have been dupes of the adornment, edifying surfaces, and moral prejudices behind which the truth has modestly hidden. As such, the opening stands as an invitation to the free-spirited to remove the moral prejudices of dogmatists in order to expose the real truth. And Nietzsche cer- tainly hopes to entice such an audience with this opening. A closer inspection suggests another meaning and another goal for the genuine philosopher, as opposed to the dispirited dogmatists. Nietzsche speaks of truth as a woman, not woman as such, or the eternal feminine, to which he refers in quotations.26 After he presents "woman" as preferring beauty and adornment to truth, we might 25. Ibid., 232. It might be noted that the first half of the chapter "Our Virtues" takes honesty as its theme, from which Nietzsche makes the transition to a discussion of woman with the following: "After this abundant civility that I have just evidenced in relation to myself I shall perhaps be permitted more readily to state a few truths about 'woman as such' - assuming that it is now known from the outset how very much these are after all only -my truths" (Beyond Good and Evil, 231). This puts all of the categorical statements Nietzsche makes about woman in the proper context of the impossibility, inadequacy, and inappropriateness of all categorical statements on the subject. 26. Derrida takes this as one indication that there are only styles, plural, no style in itself and no truth behind the style, only the infinite play of styles, indicated here by 'woman,' and always in the play of sexual difference and textual indeterminacy. "Maybe this is what Nietzsche was calling style, simulacrum, woman. A joyful wisdom shows it well: there has never been the style, the simulacrum, the woman. There has never been the sexual difference. If the simulacrum is ever going to occur, its writing must be in the interval between several styles. And the insinuation of the woman (of) Nietzsche is that, if there is going to be style, there can only be more than one" (Derrida, Spurs, p. 139). On the relation between masks in flux in the image of woman as truth see Kelly Oliver, "Woman as Truth in Nietzsche's Writing" in Feminist Interpretations of Friedrich Nietzsche, ed. Kelly Oliver and Marilyn Pearsall (University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, 1998), pp. 66-80.

Strong (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995).</page><page sequence="9">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 583 suspect that only another kind of dogmatist would be satisfied with the final goal of the unadorned truth. If the nature of truth is con- cealment and beautification, might not the specific ways in which truth presents itself be more significant than what lies beneath the adornment? Might we not say that skin deep remains superficial? Greater depth of knowledge requires not removing the adornment, but considering what the use of that adornment reveals about the character of what lies beneath it. It may be that the depths of things are revealed in the surfaces of things, because it is the deepest level that forms the surfaces that appear in public. Dogmatic philosophy may be only "the monstrous and frightening masks" behind which great things have hidden, but the masks chosen are more significant than the hidden thoughts in their impact and will reveal the most about what is most deeply hidden. The appearances, surfaces, exo- teric teachings27 are all-important because they indicate what seeks to rule. As Nietzsche will disclose in the opening chapter, the most important question about the claims of any philosopher is what seeks to rule. The Will to Power The first chapter of Beyond Good and Evil raises the question of the value of truth, but at the same time it declares the doctrine of the will to power. If Heidegger is correct, Nietzsche thus sets the stage with the metaphysical claim, which will enclose the possibilities that might reveal themselves in his work. Seen in this way, the world is will to power and all will be interpreted as will to power, the clear manifesta- tion of the determination of Being established by Western metaphysics and its aims to dominate.2s Yet the will to power is presented in Part One of Beyond Good and Evil in three or four different ways. He first introduces it in its "most spiritual form" as the drive of philosophy;29 it subsequently turns out to be the fundamental drive of all life,30 and then of nature itself.31 Laurence Lampert describes the order in which the will to power is mentioned in "The Prejudices of Philosophers" as 27. Cf. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 30. 28. Heidegger presents the will to power as Nietzsche's fundamental metaphysical doctrine, the culmination of the history of Western metaphysics. See Heidegger, Nietzsche. For a concise statement of Heidegger's view of Nietzsche's overturning as culmination rather than overcoming of Western metaphysics, see Heidegger, "Word." This view pervades Heidegger's presentation of the history of Western philosophy and his own move beyond it. 29. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 9. 30. Ibid., 13. 31. Ibid., 22.</page><page sequence="10">584 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS "the descriptive, if inadequate name, for the highest, the living and the whole,"32 revealing philosophy as the "natural apex of nature."33 Lampert accords philosophy its rightful place in directing the sciences and also understands will to power as providing a rather systematic whole for understanding all nature,34 but Nietzsche's final presenta- tion of the will to power in terms of psychology35 calls into question its use for explaining the whole of nature. Insofar as Nietzsche attributes the animating principle of life and of the highest human activity to the whole of nature, it resembles the sort of metaphysical claims that Heidegger would lead us to expect. Yet Nietzsche's attribution of the will to power to nature, or to the whole, also explicitly declares it to be interpretation and supposes that this "metaphor" might seem to be "too human."36 He attributes to the whole a view that springs from human drives, but acknowledging that he does so, he does not mistake the claim based on the human psyche for a metaphysical principle. In the first section mentioning the will to power in Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche begins with nature, but he does so precisely in order to distinguish it from human life: "Living - is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is not living--estimating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different?"37 The context of this claim contrasts human will to power with nature. What explains and animates human life and our highest capacities may not be the same as the fundamental explanation of the whole. If nature provides the model for human life, it is a negative model. Human beings aim to impose order precisely because nature does not supply order. The explanation for nature stands at odds with that for human purposes. Yet rather than a metaphysics of domination, the juxtaposition presents a psychology of the drive to domination. Nietzsche presents human striving for dominance as a phenomenon which colors the way in which the world discloses itself to us. His understanding of the will to power is a psychological principle rather a metaphysical one. Attributing it to all nature is a metaphor, the test of which is its value for life. If independent verifiability were the measure, we would be left in an epistemological loop, for the explanation of life as will to power would itself be a product of the will to power, and 32.

However, truth and falsity are not the standard, judgments can be evaluated according to their value for life, and this will entail a psychological criterion. Now, this leaves us with the complex matter of the psyche, the chief source of the prejudices Nietzsche seeks to expose in "The Prejudices of Philosophers." If the will to power is the drive of all life and the force whose most spiritual manifestation is philosophy, the problem of the psyche is already before us. If we understand the soul as at once the animating thing and the knowing thing, making us what we are, we see that Nietzsche has claimed that the will to power drives the psyche in both senses. Knowing cannot be sepa- rated from acting. The clearest meaning of the will to power can be stated: that which allows us to know the world, and to provide interpretations, is necessarily colored by the preferences and drives of our action in the world, and these are driven by the quest to make powerful the way we live. In this way, Nietzsche's fundamental doctrine of the will to power generates his famous "perspectivism."38 Nietzsche does not simply aim to remain consistent by offering his own view as yet one more interpretation, for he does not suspend evaluation of different perspectives. His procedure of assessing claims according to their value for life needs to be turned on itself. He bears the burden of demonstrating not the truth of his claims, but their value for life. The rhetorical tack Nietzsche takes in Beyond Good and Evil criticizes claims to objectivity as themselves prejudiced and perspectival in or- der to demonstrate their inconsistency. But Nietzsche not only claims that all claims are perspectival, but that they spring from the will to power. The more fundamental claim of the will to power needs to be turned on itself. Nietzsche's own writing demands that it be seen as seeking power for the view that life is will to power. Nietzsche's consistency will require that he demonstrate the value--the value for life - of the claim of the will to power. 38. Locating perspectivism as the core of Nietzsche's thought, Nehamas argues that Nietzsche employs the voice of a free spirit "narrator" in Beyond Good and Evil in order to make claims while distancing them from himself, using a literary character to assert positive claim to consistently maintain perspectivism while offering interpretations.

For this reason, Nietzsche's efforts to expose the prejudices of philoso- phers focus on prejudices about the soul. Nietzsche lays out the specific presumptions that have determined the sort of dog- matism generated by past philosophers. At the source of many of these prejudices "the fundamental faith of metaphysicians is the faith in opposite values."39 We are led to think first of good and evil as the source of such opposition, and morality of op- posites gives rise to an array of other oppositions, oppositions Nietzsche will show to be prejudices harmful to life. Opposi- tions such as spirit-matter, time-eternity, permanent-changing are the fount of prejudices about the soul, a calamitous error Nietzsche attacks, grounded in "soul atomism."40 Presuming the soul is "indestructible, eternal, indivisible, a monad, an atomon," investigations of the soul have remained trapped in moral prejudices, prejudices which have generated further oppositions to maintain the unity and durability of the soul. An agent of moral responsibility was required, and so the existence of such an entity was supposed and maintained by philosophers adjusting to what the physical sciences taught about the world. This aim has perverted all notions about the soul, and Nietzsche proposes ridding science of such notions without thereby eliminating the soul. The "synthetic concept 'I"' and the "free will" (opposed to the unfree will) have been grammatical errors and illusions of causation in a complex structure of drives. Nietzsche invites the "new psychologist" to put an end to previous superstitions without "losing" the soul in the manner of "clumsy naturalists," but instead pursuing "new versions and refinements of the soul-hypothesis" such as "'mortal soul,' and 'soul as subjective multiplicity,' and 'soul as social structure of drives and affects.'"41 Pierre Klossowski recognizes the centrality of psychology to Nietzsche's effort and the role of the multiplicity of the drives in the soul. Thus, hu- man heights are to be found in a "high tonality of soul," which Nietzsche experiences in the thought of eternal return. Yet for 39. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 2. 40. Ibid., 12. 41. Ibid.</page><page sequence="13">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 587 Klossowski, this experience is decidedly singular, and incommu- nicable.42 Thiele presents Nietzsche's understanding of the soul as a multiplicity of competing drives, locating his work in the same genre as Plato's Republic, "revitalizing a mode of theoriz- ing that had died with the Christian doctrine of soul atomism."43 He shows that the presentation of multiplicity restores the city- soul parallel, facilitating appropriate political analogies for the ordering of the soul and the contest among its drives. As Thiele shows, the political language demonstrates that the attention to multiplicity serves the purpose of speaking of order and rule. Nietzsche restores the metaphor of rule to consideration of the soul, reminding us that commanding ourselves involves being at once "the commanding and the obeying parties"44 and experienc- ing the correspondent sensations each time one wills. The body, which Nietzsche now describes as "a social structure composed of many souls," experiences unity the way "the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth."45 This political analogy introduces the issues of command just as it calls attention to the multiplicity of what is experienced as a unity. It presents the soul as a complex of many drives, vying for com- mand, experienced sometimes as a unity under its ruling drive. As such, this hypothesis accounts for both the multiplicity of drives and the experience of unity of the soul; it reveals the most important question to be the question of rule. Psychology will be freed from moral prejudices when it is understood "as morphology and the doctrine of the development of the will to power."46 Considering the soul as the social structure of drives entails considering those drives according to the will to power, as drives vying for power. All claims will be understood not according to their correspondence with truth, but according to what seeks to gain power by making that claim. If the soul is understood 42. Pierre Klossowski, Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle, trans. Daniel W. Smith (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), pp. 66, 93. Klosswski wonders if Nietzsche's writing seeks to "transmit states of his own soul" (p. 7) and depicts Nietzsche's life and work as fluctuating between the attempts to transmit such states and recognition of the impossibility of doing so until the final silence of his madness (pp. 65, 73, 250). Among the purposes of this essay is to demonstrate that Nietzsche's efforts "to communicate an inner state" (EH Books 4) serve to encourage the process of self-overcoming. Recognizing the need for self-overcoming, he exhibits the self- overcoming of modernity prejudices in a manner meant to provoke his readers on their own quest. 43.

If will to power is the principle of the psyche, all knowing will be determined by will to power and there can be no objection that its claims are not true; the new question of what seeks power by this claim will take precedence. Nietzsche declares psychology to "now again be the path to the fundamental problems."47 The greatest sig- nificance of the will to power will be its psychological meaning. Once we turn the will to power on itself, we cannot be sure how adequately it will account for the other levels on which it is used as explanation. Claims about the world will have primarily a psychological meaning, indicating what drives the psyche assert- ing the claims. Establishing psychology as fundamental, Nietzsche teaches us to evaluate claims according to their psychological ef- fects rather than their objective truth about the world. Understood in this way, the will to power in no way constitutes a fundamental metaphysical claim; rather, it provides an invitation to restore the possibility of a psychology that does not resort to a metaphysics of opposites. Having established that the measure for evaluating a judgment is the "question of to what extent it is life-promoting," not its truthfulness, the new psychology has the task of demonstrating how it might be possible to make judgments without recourse to independent standards of truth. The value of any claim will be found in the sorts of life it produces; the fundamental grounds will not be metaphysical or epistemological, but ethical and psychological. The Value of Truth The greatest prejudice of philosophers has been the value of truth. Beyond Good and Evil opens with the question of the value of truth because the unwise presumption that truth is good has prejudiced those who sought objectivity in the name of truth. Once psychology becomes fundamental, the question of the value of the truth becomes the question of the value of the will to truth, a psychic drive. Nietzsche aims to separate the drive to truth from all other purposes, describing the "will to knowledge" as a species of a the "will to ignorance."48 Nietzsche employs the figure of the free spirit in his critique of the enlightenment preference for truth while challenging the view of freedom understood as liberation from prejudices. 47. Ibid., 23 48. Ibid., 24</page><page sequence="15">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 589 Beginning with freedom, Nietzsche systematically calls into question the value of the very values, truthfulness, equality, and freedom, which move the modern enlightenment age: "Indepen- dence is for the very few; it is a privilege of the strong."49 Freedom from the common way of life determined by prejudices, so highly valued by enlightenment rationalism, Nietzsche declares, is not something readily acquired and not capable of being attained by all. He makes a sharp division between freedom and equality. Connecting independence with rarity, he invokes the image of Theseus, "daring to the point of recklessness. ... He enters into a labyrinth" and runs the risk of being torn apart by some "minotaur of conscience."50 Independence requires great risk, and not even of a sort that might gain public recognition or assistance. Alone, the truly independent risk the danger of leaving the life-sustaining horizons of others, unsure of the presence of an Ariadne thread by which they might return. The rarity and independence of spirit of such a figure destroys sympathy for others, which makes his future benefit to others less likely.51 He now fully separates the quest for independence and knowledge from any concern to benefit others. Yet as he invokes the image of Theseus, we might also be reminded that he did return as Athenian founder, one of the great examples of founders employed in Machiavelli's Prince, to which Nietzsche has just called attention.52 The secrecy of those who have established new modes and orders bespeaks their independence and their daring, but such accomplishments have had little to do with truthfulness, but rather have been surrounded in the mythology as impenetrable as any labyrinth.53 Nietzsche already hints at the theme that will increasingly shape the book. The independence sought by the free spirits partially governed by enlightenment values, is in fact a rare privilege, and one involving the capacity for responsibility for form- ing ways of life. 49.

Appealing to truthfulness just as he questions its value, Nietzsche appears to be oddly explicit about esotericism: Our highest insights must - and should - sound like follies and sometimes like crimes when they are heard without permission by those who are not predisposed and predestined for them. The difference between the exoteric and the esoteric, formerly known to philosophers - among the Indians as among the Greeks, Persians, and Muslims, in short, wherever one believed in an order of rank and not in equality and equal rights.54 Inequality demands esoteric writing, for the same things are not suitable for all audiences,55 but Nietzsche also makes clear that in- equality will itself create an exoteric surface as the highest insights are heard as follies and crimes. The history of Nietzsche's recep- tion shows that his words have at times sounded like both crimes and follies to readers. In declaring the need for esoteric writing, Nietzsche declares the inequality of humanity. Appealing to the pride of his truth-valuing readers, he invites them to suppose that they are among the select few who deserve freedom, but may only preserve their sense of freedom by jettisoning notions of equality. In his apparent openness about esotericism, Nietzsche appeals to the enlightenment spirit of exposing the truth. He presents equality as another prejudice, at odds with truthfulness, and the belief in this prejudice as the necessary condition of truthfulness. Without this presumption, there is good reason to see that a universal morality might not be appropriate and the different values will best serve different types. 54. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 30. 55. Kofman acknowledges that among the effects of Nietzsche's use of metaphoric and aphoristic writing "also aims to discourage the common" and "wants to make itself understood only by those who are linked by having the same refined impressions" (Kofman, Nietzshe and Metaphor, pp. 114-15). Lampert emphasizes the connection between hierarchy and esotericism rather than contrasting surfaces and depths. He argues that "Nietzsche's exoteric teaching aims to align the exoteric with the esoteric," so that the public teaching will be in accord with the exceptional even if it does not reach their heights. For Lampert, this explains Nietzsche's dispelling prejudices as the task of philosophers becomes "to expose the exoteric lies of previous philosophers" (Lampert, Nietzsche's Task, p. 74). Among the lies Nietzsche exposes is the value of truth itself, apparently demanding interpretations that do not claim truth for themselves, even as Nietzsche expects they will be accepted as truths. Cf. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 295.</page><page sequence="17">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 591 Having prepared his readers with an approach more familiar to their eyes, Nietzsche declares, "What serves the higher type of men as nourishment or delectation must almost be poison for a very different and inferior type. The virtues of the common man may perhaps signify vice and weakness in a philosopher."56 Exposing the need for untruthfulness is part of Nietzsche's effort to invite consideration of a hierarchy of values. He identifies the matter of esoteric and exoteric not as depth and surface, but as a matter of heights: "What is more essential is that the exoteric approach sees things from below, the esoteric looks down from above. There are heights of the soul from which even tragedy ceases to look tragic."57 If the question of the value of truth, the opening question of the book, may be taken as its guiding question, the tragedy regarding the value of truth is that of Oedipus, invoked in the first section.58 Sophocles' Oedipus plays raise the question of the value of the truth and expose its disvalue so dramatically that blindness appears to become a signal of wisdom. From Oedipus's perspective, it could surely be said that the value of untruth, or more precisely, the dis- value of truth, "looks" tragic. His greatest success, his hubris, and his downfall are all a result of his placing high value in unriddling the truth. Oedipus' tragic hope for radical freedom is already inter- twined with the value of truth as found in the enlightenment values Nietzsche questions here. It might not be an overstatement to suggest that Nietzsche's aim in Beyond Good and Evil is to encourage a path to heights where the tragedy of the value of untruth ceases to look tragic. This would give an elevated place to comedy and to laughter as Nietzsche does when he proposes "an order of rank among philosophers depending on the rank of their laughter" and introduces laughing gods in the closing pages of the book.59 The tragic wisdom of Sophocles supplies a preliminary model, already a height above Oedipus's view of the value of truth, but in this context Nietzsche holds Aristophanes, the comic poet, as the figure who redeems everything Hellenic and invites his attention to Plato's secrecy.60 Nietzsche's overcoming of modernity will not attempt wholly to displace his forefathers in hubristic presumption of freedom to begin as if from nowhere; nor will he resign himself to the restraints imposed by tragic wisdom. Ascending to the heights beyond tragedy will entail combining the 56. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 30. 57. Ibid., 30. 58. Ibid., 1. 59. Ibid., 294. 60. Ibid., 28.</page><page sequence="18">592 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS acknowledgment of the limits of humanity and human freedom, while pursuing the highest of human aspirations. As Nietzsche distinguishes between types of audiences, he speaks of books "that call the bravest to their courage."''61 We might think of Nietzsche's books as such books. Courage takes a central place in his account of human strengths because aspiration in the face of constraints, rather than in blindness to constraints, requires courage, a virtue that might distinguish those capable of heights beyond the tragic for whom hard truths are not spirit-crushing truths. As he appeals to character, Nietzsche critiques categorical and in- tentional morality as a byproduct of the superstition of soul atomism, and his procedure is on full display. Comparing "morality of inten- tions" to "astrology and alchemy," he appears to proceed in perfect consistency with enlightenment aims while enlarging the realm in which it uncovers prejudices to be rejected. He appears again to prefer truth to all moral prejudices that are to be eliminated along with all prejudices about nature's relation to human purposes. He accordingly appeals to truthfulness in the aim of overcoming morality: The overcoming of morality, in a certain sense even the self-overcoming of morality--let this be the name for that long secret work which has been saved up for the finest and most honest, also the most malicious, consciences of today, as living touchstones of the soul.62 The psychological task is the self-overcoming of morality through honesty, for honesty itself is a product of moral prejudice. He uses moral prejudice against itself, calling for brutal honesty, demand- ing that the "whole morality of self-denial must be questioned mercilessly and taken to court,"63 a question that will challenge truthfulness itself: "It is no more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than mere appearance."" Having recruited honest free-spirited readers to his task of calling morality into question, he exposes the valuing of truth as yet another prejudice to be overcome by the task of such questioning. Preparing the disposed reader in this way, he makes the further claim that the value of truth is a harmful prejudice: "There would be no life at all if not on the basis of perspective estimates and appearances."65 Life and truth are at odds; life requires untruth, even prejudices. Nietzsche em- ploys a rhetorical tack suited both to the audience of his time and 61. Ibid., 30. 62. Ibid., 32. 63. Ibid., 33. 64. Ibid., 34. 65. Ibid.</page><page sequence="19">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 593 the message that he brings. Declaring that life requires prejudices would leave no room for rejecting prejudices. It is only from the excessive valuation of unadorned truth that it appears to be bad to have prejudices. He adopts the position of opposing prejudices in order to reject the prejudice against prejudice. Openly declaring, in the manner of enlightenment, that the truth is not good, Nietzsche rejects the central tenet of enlightenment values. Even as he says the truth is not good, Nietzsche's narrative voice proceeds as if the truth were good, openly declaring this truth. Nietzsche states his rejection of the enlightenment presump- tion, mocking Voltaire, "'il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien' --I bet he finds nothing."66 Even as he makes explicit the claims that the true is not good, he acts as if it is, adopting the stance of a radical form of enlightenment preference for truth in order to use its prejudices against themselves. Driving this wedge between the true and the good leaves the question of which we are to prefer, the true or the good. Lampert emphasizes this separation of the true and the good as a rejection of Platonism and "the remnant of faith held by Enlightenment nannies," but sees this as directing "lovers of truth" to mature and be "intelligently prejudiced in truth's favor." In this interpretation Nietzsche aims to free the love of truth from all moral prejudices that might stand in the way of its pursuit.67 The enlightenment prejudice for truthfulness, now separated from any claim to goodness, takes the form of merciless questioning, which has abandoned all concern for goodness. The pursuit of truth might now be properly placed beyond good and evil. Or, so it would appear to those who remain bound to this prejudice, and thus to the exoteric surface designed for those with such a prejudice. On one level, the separation of the true and the good permits the free-spirited to pursue truth without restraints of morality (without regard for consequences, we would say, if we had not been so recently reminded of the limitations of nonconsequential morality and the prejudices it entails). The all-too-honest enlight- enment spirits, like Stoics and ascetic priests, remain attached to a virtue, in their case honesty, far beyond the service it may do in the world. On a further level, enticing the free-spirited toward the goal of merciless questioning of devotion, self-sacrifice, and self-denial may turn into questioning of their service to life and a life-affirming form of humanity rather than their truth. Morality of good and evil will be called into question not to be replaced by 66. Ibid., 35 ("He seeks the true only in order to do the good."). 67. Lampert, Nietzsche's Task, pp. 82-84.</page><page sequence="20">594 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS honesty and radical openness, but to be replaced with new judg- ments about the best ways of life. As "whatever is profound loves masks,"68 Nietzsche permits the concealment of his project under the masks of the free-spirited aim of greater honesty. He employs a strange new esotericism in which the surface appears as the most penetrating honesty. This will appeal to a "free-spirited" age, in which truthfulness is so highly valued, in order to enact the self-overcoming of the values of en- lightenment. Nietzsche's mask in Beyond Good and Evil is the mask of the most thoroughgoing exposure of the most terrible truths; it is a mask designed to seduce readers into thinking themselves in on the secret on the basis of a very superficial reading, but this only as they remain attached to the values of enlightenment, which had already been about the project of debunking previous faiths, prejudices, and values in the name of truth. This new sort of mask is not only the desideratum of the most profound, but a necessity: Every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is growing continually, owing to the constantly false, namely shallow, interpretation of every word, every step, every sign of life he gives.69 Nietzsche's new interpretation of esotericism, previously under- stood by philosophers who did not believe in equality, allows for greater apparent openness than those who sought to offer edifying moral lessons to the greater part of their audience. The inequality of audiences, as Nietzsche presents them, will itself create masks even as one openly declares the harshest truths. Many readers will pass over the harshest truths presented to them rather than awaken thoughts they cannot endure. Openness might be its own sort of mask. Attractively designed truths may well seduce the unprepared to reject the values that have sustained their lives without a real ca- pacity for new growth. The harshest presentations of the deadliest truths will keep away those who cannot think the most troubling thoughts to their depths, it will keep them away even if they read them, for if they do not look like "crimes" they will look like mere "follies" when presented to those "not predestined for them."70 Of course, this very harshness may prove the most seductive of all ap- pearances, and his books have been attracting readers of many sorts since he has written them (or at least shortly after). Speaking openly 68. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 40. 69. Ibid. 70. Ibid., 30.</page><page sequence="21">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 595 of masks and esotericism, Nietzsche allows everyone to think he or she is in on the secret; each will get what is due based on his or her own capacity. Nietzsche knows that the greatest means by which an author might keep inappropriate meanings from unfit audiences is not by employing encoded writing, but by way of the shallow- ness of readers themselves. In this way, his harshness will conceal his subtlety, for his apparent openness will leave everyone to come away thinking they have penetrated more deeply into matters than most, if not all, previous philosophers. New Judgments While some will continue to presume their own capacity for free- dom when it is lacking, Nietzsche's free spirit comes to acknowledge a hierarchy. The new philosophers are above him, and the indepen- dence of new philosophers' judgments is a function of their height, not mere individuality. The free spirit introduces the philosophers of the future as a type superior to himself. They will not be dogmatists, but they will offer judgments that they declare to be their own; "'My judgment is my judgment': no one else is easily entitled to it,"71 they will say. For those who would see the separation of the true from the good as a clear preference for the true beyond all moral limitations, Nietzsche writes of a new hierarchical understanding of the good: "'Good' is no longer good when one's neighbor mouths it. And how should there be a 'common good'!"72 He will accordingly not speak very often of the good, even as he openly speaks of the problem of truth, the use of masks, and the need for esotericism. Goods held by all thereby lose their goodness, and so are endangered by open speech. Nietzsche's attention to value will not only be destructive; beyond good and evil will not be beyond all claims for the good. While he opposes common standards shaped by morality of good and evil, the good will continue to supply the measure for justice understood as hierarchical, "rare is for the rare."73 In the free spirits' voice, Nietzsche acknowledges the limits of their goal, freedom. Having introduced the philosopher of the future as a superior type, Nietzsche's free spirit "feel[s] an obligation" to distinguish himself and the new philosophers he heralds from the common understanding of the free spirit, free thinker, and other representatives of modern ideas. The goal of new types "beyond good and evil" must be located beyond the freedom sought by these 71. Ibid., 43. 72. Ibid., 43. 73. Ibid., 43.</page><page sequence="22">596 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS other modern men. The apparent goal of freedom will have given way to higher goals, which include obligations, and this duty will not be the end of this newfound responsibility. "New philosophers," although like "we free spirits" in their friendship with "solitude," might be defined, and distinguished from the freedom of the free spirits, by their obligation. The questioning regarding values will acquire new purpose: We think that hardness, forcefulness, slavery, danger in the alley and the heart, life in hiding, stoicism, the art of experiment and devilry of every kind, that everything evil, terrible, tyrannical in man, everything in him that is kin to beasts of prey and serpents, serves the enhancement of the species "man" as much as its opposite does.74 Still in the free spirit voice of "we opposite men" the preference for what has been considered evil is emphasized; however, freed from old restraints the new task emerges in the goal of enhancing man- kind. Beyond the most thoroughgoing truthfulness, philosophers of the future will have the task of shaping and enhancing human- ity, and they will not be bound by truthfulness in their attempts at this higher goal. In the free spirit's attempts to "unriddle" these attempters, experimenters (Versucher), they will "want to remain riddles."75 Beyond the potentially tragic unriddling capacity of the free spirit and his enlightenment progenitors, the independence of judgment offered by philosophers of the future will preserve their solitude as riddles. They will not retain the solitude of isolation from humanity, but rather than seeking to reveal themselves, they will undertake their monumental obligation to form values that serve life and promote the flourishing of human possibilities. Having turned the debunking procedure of enlightenment on itself and thereby discredited the goodness of truth as yet another prejudice, he re-opens the possibility of religious claims. If reason has not in fact debunked claims of faith, religious claims still war- rant consideration. Instead of abandoning evaluation, Nietzsche provides new criteria for judgment, new criteria that follow directly from finding psychology the path to the fundamental problems. Nietzsche opens his discussion of the religious: The human soul has its limits, the range of inner experiences, the whole history of the soul so far and its as yet unexhausted possibilities--that is the predestined hunting ground and lover of the '"great hunt." 74. Ibid., 44. 75. Ibid., 42. 76. Ibid., 45.</page><page sequence="23">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 597 The site for the discussion of the religious possibilities is the hu- man soul. With this, Nietzsche provides some indication of what he will mean by the religious--it will concern ways of life, the states of soul that correspond to them, and the continued possibilities for such states. He announces that we have not yet realized the end of history, whether doing so would be for good or ill.77 All possi- bilities have not been exhausted, but new possibilities will only be discovered or formed by plumbing the depths of the human soul in the spirit of a hunter, who is a born psychologist, rather than that of the scholar, who lacks the "courage, sense, and subtlety."78 It is clear that Nietzsche's conception of the psychologist is no mere scholarly analyst of the psyche. He contrasts the scholar, "a type of man that is not noble" and his virtues, "industriousness, patient acceptance of his place in rank and file, evenness and moderation in his abilities and needs, an instinct for his equals and for what they need [quiet and recognition]" with the authoritative and self-suf- ficient genius who "either begets or gives birth, taking both terms in their most elevated sense"79 and the genuine philosopher who "lives 'unphilosophically' and 'unwisely,' above all imprudently, and feels the burden and the duty of a hundred attempts and temptations of life -he risks himself constantly, he plays the wicked game."80 Philosophers will reach for the future with their creating and legislating while mere scholars and "philosophic laborers" as- semble the remnants of the past. The born psychologists, who are "Commanders and legislators" who "say 'Thus it shall be!'"'81 will possess the hunter's virtues of genuine philosophers, the courage to experiment and bring about new ways of life. Such a psychologist with a taste for danger will not appear anything like the scholarly 77. This stands in contrast with the famous speech of "Zarathustra's Prologue," in which Zarathustra seems to accept the prevailing Hegelian view that all human possibilities have been reached, even as he despairs at this situation. He despairs of the onset of the "last man" and presents the alternative as something altogether beyond man, an "Uebermensch." While Zarathustra may move beyond his own eschatology, Nietzsche clearly declares there to be human possibilities to be explored. 78. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 45. 79. Ibid,. 206.

While Peter Berkowitz argues that reason remains implicitly highest because "it is reason, not the will, that crowns the will,"82 he also maintains that the willfully creative is at the peak of Nietzsche's estimation of human life.83 Berkowitz's excessive separation of the two relies on a view that sees in the philosopher of the future arbi- trary creation, springing from a strength of will lacking in the free spirit. Yet the free spirit's presentation of the philosopher of the future exaggerates his creative character to distinguish him from the mere scholars. Later, speaking as one of "we scholars," Nietzsche announces the distinction between scholars and philosophical laborers, on the one hand, and the creative task of genuine philoso- phers on the other.84 It may be that from the scholar's perspective the philosopher's activity looks like arbitrary willful creation. This is from the limited view of scholars habituated to the practice of demonstrating the reasons for everything. The strong distinction too easily obscures that the genuine philosopher will have his reasons, but will not feel the need to demonstrate them with exhaustive sup- porting evidence and footnotes.85 The philosopher of the future will share in the insight of free spirits while pursuing grander goals than presenting their truths. New philosophers will be astute psycholo- gists who will use that ability to create the values that govern the way humanity lives. In his estimation of religions, Nietzsche demonstrates how psychological strength rather than truthfulness may be used to evaluate competing interpretations of the world and the ways of life they spawn. In the Greeks, Nietzsche finds a positive model, an instructive example of his manner of evaluation: What is amazing about the religiosity of the ancient Greeks is the enormous abundance of gratitude it exudes: it is a very noble type of man who confronts nature and life in this way.86 82. Peter Berkowitz, Nietzsche: The Ethics of an Immoralist (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1995), p. 20.

Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, 49.</page><page sequence="25">NIETZSCHE'S MASKS 599 Psychological type is the quality to be measured, nobility the bench- mark, and confrontation with the life the measure. The ancient Greek religiosity is noble because it confronts life rather than forming a life-denying morality, such as creates the saintly type. Nietzsche has now provided a clear example of what it would mean to evaluate by the extent to which a judgment is life-promoting rather than by whether it is true or false. The literal falseness of the myths that generate Greek religion is no objection for Nietzsche. Avoiding op- positions, its anthropomorphic gods characterized by imperfections, strivings, attachments, and conflicts elevate human life without denying its character. Its presentation of the world shaped by the conflict, generation, and preferences of the gods reflects human life and promotes an embrace of human life, its struggle, conflict, and difficulty, rather than positing opposites or rejecting elements of life as evil to be eliminated in a world vastly different from our own. Nobility stands above truthfulness in Nietzsche's estimation of claims about the world; it stands above good and evil as a measure of human lives and psychological types. After establishing the highest standard and demonstrating its use, Nietzsche recounts the history of religious sacrifice as "a great ladder of religious cruelty.""87 After sacrificing God himself, there remains no reason to sacrifice the earth, and a new life-af- firming possibility emerges. The only mention of eternal return in Beyond Good and Evil follows this account of religious cruelty, for out of the deepest depths of nihilism and pessimism may come the greatest heights and joy in the most life-affirming overcoming of despair: Whoever has really, with an Asiatic and supra-Asiatic eye, looked into, down into the most world-denying of all possible ways of thinking- beyond good and evil and no longer, like the Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the spell and delusion of morality-- may just thereby, without really meaning to do so, have opened his eyes to the opposite ideal: the ideal of the most high-spirited, alive, and world-affirming human being, who has not only come to terms and learned to get along with whatever was and is but who wants to have what has and is repeated into all eternity, shouting insatiably da capo-not only to himself but to the whole play and spectacle.88 The ideal that wants this life to be repeated for all eternity is the opposite ideal to the whole ladder of cruelty, rising out of nihilistic life-denial for once it has sacrificed God it has eliminated the ideal 87.

No longer supposing an otherworld different from this world, it may embrace this world and celebrate life rather than sacrifice "nature" and instinct to an ideal opposed to the world. The overcoming of the philosophers' prejudices of opposites opens the possibility of affirming this life. The life-affirming spirit charac- teristic of Greek religion or those who embrace the eternal return distinguishes a noble way of life, the aim Nietzsche locates higher than the aim of truth. Having identified the goal, noble affirmation of life, Nietzsche is able to present a new description of the philosopher, and he does so from the perspective of the free spirit: The philosopher as we understand him, we free spirits - as the man of the most comprehensive responsibility who has the conscience for the overall development of man-this philosopher will make use of religions for his project of cultivation and education, just as he will make use of whatever political and economic states are at hand.89 Philosophers will use and even form religions for the sake of promoting life-affirming human beings, far from being bound by truthfulness. Nietzsche presents this claim in the voice of the free spirit, for he has artfully drawn readers who might include themselves in this "we," those attracted by the goal of freedom, to recognize a higher type Nietzsche's writing has drawn those attract- ed by freedom to the higher goal of comprehensive responsibility. Lampert argues that Nietzsche's task is to promote love of the truth that frees itself from "moral fictions," and even as it employs "art," it does so to foster love of truth. "Untethered search for the true," while freeing itself from moral prejudices, may "open one's eyes to a new good," a good found in "love of truth that matures into love of the world."90 In this way Lampert's interpretation sees the truth serving the good after all, successfully only when it frees itself from the concern for the good wrapped in moral prejudices that stand in the way of truth. Yet Nietzsche presents love for life as a worthy goal not necessarily compatible with freedom from fic- tion or accord with the whole of the world. His estimation of value presents the priority of the good, now presented as the noble, to separate it from old moral fictions while preparing the future for new myths and preparing the grounds for the superiority of one perspectival interpretation to another.

Signs of Nobility While using the standard of nobility for judgment throughout the work, Nietzsche comes closest to providing a definition of nobility in the final chapter "What Is Noble." Strictly speaking, he does not define the noble, but offers signs and attributes of what may be characterized as noble. In the context of introducing his famous distinction between master morality and slave morality,92 distinguishing between the way each views the good, Nietzsche writes, "It should be noted immediately that in this first type of morality the opposition of 'good' and 'bad' means approximately the same as 'noble' and 'contemptible' (The opposition of 'good' and 'evil' has a different origin)."93 The noble offers a category for judgment that is apart from good and evil. Genealogically prior, such evaluation may stand after the overcoming, beyond good and evil. In the last chapter of the book, Nietzsche reveals that what is beyond good and evil is what is noble. Assessing nobility will involve describing a character type, one who experiences itself as "value-creating."94 Nietzsche further describes how the noble soul will honor, "The noble human being honors himself as one who is powerful."95 As such he will exemplify the height of the most fundamental drive, the will to power. The noble type both has such power and honors power, but "also as one who has power over himself."96 Given Nietzsche's claim that "What is essential 'in heaven and on earth' seems to be, to say it once more, that there should be obedience over a long period of time and in a single direction,"97 the capacity for power over oneself is an important criterion. No simple freedom is possible, Nietzsche now reveals to the audience he hooked with appeals to freedom. There is always command and obedience. The only way not to be commanded by others is to become capable of command over oneself.98 Nietzsche's psychology of multiple drives allows us to see that the capacity 92.

Yet Nietzsche quite clearly speaks of external political regimes as the condition for the cultivation of the self. Indeed, Nietzsche begins the chapter entitled "What Is Noble" on the social conditions that shape the most elevated human types. "Every enhancement of the type 'man' has so far been the work of an aristocratic society -and it will be so again and again."102 While Thiele's account is instructive regarding the internal strife and self-overcoming that characterize the noble soul, Nietzsche uses primarily political examples of success in such an endeavor, describing "the most beautiful expression" of "real mastery in subtlety in waging war against oneself" in "Alcibi- ades and Caesar" (to whose company I should like to add that first European after my taste the Hohenstaufen Frederick II) and among artists perhaps Leonardo da Vinci."103 Nietzsche describes these fig- ures precisely as models of success in confronting their "heritage of multiple origins."104 These figures have arisen amidst the decadent mixing of late cultures and succeeded in mastering the war within themselves to forge an order of command. As victory in war with oneself provides a more subtle model of nobility than the original simple master morality, before good and evil, the conditions for such a possibility becomes crucial to Nietzsche's portrait of the noble soul beyond good and evil. Even if Nietzsche never offers specific politi- cal prescriptions, his concerns direct us to the externally political. He avoids specific prescriptions because the political problem does not admit of singular solutions, precisely because the self-overcoming necessary for strength and growth requires confrontation with the difficulties of a particular age. Nietzsche's own work exhibits exactly such confrontation as it builds through contest with the prejudices of the age toward new nobility and responsibility. 99. Cf.

Nietzsche has transformed freedom understood as liberation into the responsibility for command characteristic of the noble soul. While Nietzsche presents such figures as beyond universal obli- gations, which they see as unjust, he describes them as bound by a higher standard of duty than they expect from others. The first responsibility of the noble soul will be to create order among the drives in itself. The genuinely noble will have a high sense of duty for commanding, ordering, and directing the paths of human lives. In light of this responsibility the most distinguished individuals are marked by their capacity for self-command. The duties of the noble soul are governed by what permits power over itself and conditions itself for command not the universal imperatives of a transcendent subject. Beyond the freedom sought by a free spirit, the noble soul will understand that his privileges come with duties, come as du- ties. Beyond moralities of good and evil, the noble soul will not understand these duties as universal. Beyond good and evil and beyond mere freedom lies the nobility of the most comprehensive responsibility. Freedom is only possible when it becomes the capacity for com- mand, and the self-overcoming that allows self-command comes with responsibility. Thiele's antipolitical interpretation of Nietzsche's presentation of the ordering of the soul frees the philosopher from the obligation for noble lies, or masks and appearances, the concern of which is the order of polities (or the soul writ large to restore ancient connection between regime and character).106 Yet for Ni- etzsche, the philosopher paints images and offers interpretation that will determine how others see the world and how they live their lives, and a noble soul bears responsibility for such appear- ances and their effects. Among Nietzsche's aims is to re-awaken a sense of responsibility for these images. Nietzsche's chief objection to the enlightenment project is not its self-contradiction, although he uses this as a wedge against it, but rather its irresponsibility. The 105. Ibid., 272. 106.

In promoting nobility and responsibility through his critique of enlightenment, Nietzsche teaches his readers the responsibility to consider the effects of interpretations. For Nietzsche, philosophy bears the task of establishing the basis for rule, an obligation as fundamentally political as it is removed from the concerns of immediate politics. The will to power gives an interpretative name to this striving which unifies the soul when it is successful and attaches it to successful projects within life. The psychological effects of interpreting human action as flowing from the will to power provides the reason to interpret the world as will to power, corresponding to an interpretation of our psychic structure, for it will promote the striving of life-affirming projects. It may be a mere image, but it is one designed to promote responsible action to bring about healthy, strong, and noble lives rather than those that merely condemn the alternatives as evil or uphold the goodness of one's own soul in its powerlessness. Healthy, strong, and noble drives will not be content with declaring their own goodness; they will seek to rule. Presenting the soul as the contest for power reminds us that life entails such contested striving; confronting life without the responsibility to engage in such aims is ignoble. Nietzsche pres- ents the comprehensive responsibility of philosophy; it must bear the burden for the interpretations it offers. The measure for noble responsibility will be human life and its capacity. As Nietzsche presents nature in a way that would pro- vide guidance only in the most negative way, he sets human aims against natural indifference. But as a negative guide, nature remains instructive understood as defining the limits of human possibilities. Noble aims will lie within human possibility rather than granting some extranatural satisfaction to our striving; not metaphysics but the psychological demands of humanity lie beyond the indiffer- ence of nature. The philosopher of the future as a psychologist will carefully consider the limits and possibilities of humanity and the time to which he appeals. He will share with the "free spirit" a keen capacity as an unriddler of souls even as he remains a riddle himself, forming interpretations that encourage healthy confrontations with life, its possibilities, and its limits, rather than offering the truth of his observations. The demands of a noble confrontation with this limited life and its striving will be the highest demands there are. Directing modernity towards this possibility is Nietzsche's most comprehensive aim.</page></plain_text>
