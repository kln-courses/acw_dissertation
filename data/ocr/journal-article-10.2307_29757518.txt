<plain_text><page sequence="1">Territorial Division as Gleaned from Memorial Stones by K. RAJAN Introduction Commemoration of heroism is a universal act. Paying homage to the departed soul by erecting a memorial or edifice in honour of the people who laid down their lives for the sake of their society is an age-old practice in India. The character and design, the media and content of the memorials varied through the ages and space. The early memorial stones were raised in memory of the heroes who died in cattle raids but later were erected to honour the deceased who died in other circumstances too. The megalithic tombs, stupas, memorial stones, pillars and other allied ancient architectural edifices found in south India are basically memorials. The evolutionary process of these memorials is well attested by literary and material records. This paper attempts to explore the territorial aspect of the region as gleaned from memorial stones. However a short introduction is necessary to understand the nature of these memorials. The basic theme connected with memorial stones in Tamil Nadu is cattle lifting or catde retrieving. The earliest record of a memorial stone is found in the Sangam literature of the 1st century A.D. and the latter has been described by more than 25 poets (Table 1). However the archaeological data so far discovered go back only to the 4th-5th century A.D. Thus, the non? availability of the Sangam period memorials poses a serious problem in applying the descriptive data of Sangam literature to the later memorial stones. Though the tradition continued further there is a possibility of minor changes in that tradition in the following centuries. The absence of Sangam Age memorial stones today leads us to take a second look at the descriptive nature of the literary data. The study of inscribed potsherds from the Sangam Age sites like Arikamedu (Wheeler 1946), Kodumanal (Rajan 1994), Uraiyur (Raman 1969) and Alagankulam (Majeed 1992) from the coins issued by Chera kings Kolliporai and Makkotai and Pandya king Nedunceliyan (Krishnamurthy 1997) and from the cave inscriptions found throughout Tamil Nadu with high concentration in and around Madurai (Mahadevan 1966: 57-73) clearly demonstrate that the script used during the Sangam period was Tamil-Brahmi. The occurrence of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions of the Sangam Age king Athiyaman at Jambai on the bank of the Pennaiyar (Nagasamy 1981), found in the memorial stone yielding area, unequivocably establishes the fact that this memorial stone yielding area also used the Tamil Brahmi script for their writing during the Sangam Age. Further, the recent finds of the Indalur memorial stone (Mahadevan 1997: 1-9) and Arasalapuram memorial stone near Ennayiram (Rajavelu 1996: 88-89) clearly show the evolution of the vatteluttu script from Tamil-Brahmi around the 4th century A.D. If we take this into consideration, the obvious inference would be that the memorial stones of the Sangam Age must have been written in Tamil-Brahmi script. But the earliest inscribed memorial stones so far discovered in Tamil Nadu carry only vatteluttu script, which developed out of Tamil-Brahmi script around the [i] 359</page><page sequence="2">Table 1 - References found in Sangam literature on memorial stones Poem Name Poet Patron Poem No. Verse Remarks Akananuru Karuntodai Kavinar Akananuru Purananuru Akananuru Akananuru Akananuru Narrinai Kuruntokai Ainkurunuru Akananuru Kuruntokai Akananuru Akananuru Purananuru Vemparrur Kumaranar Irumbidar-talaiyar Irangukudi Kundranadan Madurai Eelattu Pudan Tevanar Kavanmullai Putarattanar Madurai Palli Marutankilar makanar Sokuttanar Virruru Muteyinanar Otalantaiyar Mamulanar Madurai Maruthan Ilanakanar Kudavayir Kirattanar Eyinanthai makan Ilangkiranar Uraiyur Ham Pon Vanikanar Ceralatan Athiyan Moriyar Nanmaran Valuthi Gangan Katti Nannan Poraiyan Titiyan 109 ambin visai ita vilntor ennu varambu ariya uval itu pattukkai 157 vil ida vilntor patukkai 3 ambuvida vilntor vambap patukkai 215 ambin eval atavar aal alittu uyartta anjuvaru patukkai 231 patukalattu uyartta mayirtalai patukkai 151 patukkai 352 patukkai nilal otukku itam 372 patukkai 362 patukkai 91 paral uyar patukkai 11 uval itu patukkai nedunal yanaikku itu nilal akum ariya kanam 35 vil er valkai vilu totai maravar val an patukkai kadavut penmar nadukal 289 uyar patukku... netunilai nadukal 264 paral udai marungin patukkai certti ini nattanare kallum kanrotu karavai tantu pakaivar ottiya netuntakai Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cairn circle entombing cist Cist with menhir Cist with menhir Cairn circle entombing cist with menhir for a cattle retriever continue 360 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Continue Table 1 Poem Name Poet Patron Poem No. Verse Remarks Akananuru Noipatiyar Akananuru Ainkurunuru Akananuru Akananuru Akananuru Akananuru Akananuru Purananuru Purananuru Purananuru Purananuru Purananuru Purananuru Purananuru Malaipadu kadam Sittalai Sattanar Otalantaiyar Madurai Maruthan Ilanaganar Madurai Maruthan Ilanaganar Madurai Maruthan Ilanaganar Madurai Maruthan Ilanaganar Madurai Maruthan Ilanaganar Madurai Maruthan Ilanaganar Avur Mulan kilar Awaiyar Pottiyar Pottiyar Allur Nan Mulliyar Aiyur Mudavanar Atan Elini Madurai Aruvai Vanikan Ilavettanar Perunkavu sikanar Nanmaran Valuthi Nanmaran Valuthi Nanmaran Valuthi Nanmaran Valuthi Nanmaran Valuthi Nanmaran Valuthi Nanmaran Valuthi Killivalavan Nanmaran Athiyaman Neduman Anji Koperun Cholan Koperun Cholan Killi Valavan Pasumput Poraiyan Pari Nannan 67 peeli sutiya pirangu inali nadukal... niraikandanna uval idu patukkai eluttudai nadukal 53 352 131 vilu total maravar vil itat tolaintor eluttutai nadukal kantrin katai mani uku nir tutaitta 269 nattapolum nata netunkal 297 pern mutir nadukal peyar payam patarat tonru kuyil eluttu 343 nadukal... kur uli kuyinra kotumai eluttu 365 atta nadukal aal ena utaitta kana yanai Cist with menhir for a cattle retriever Menhir with painting Menhir with painting Menhir for a cattle retriever Menhir Menhir with an engraving Menhir with an engraving Menhir or anthropomorphic 387 nirai nilai nadukal Menhir/herostone 261 nirai ivan tantu nadukal akiya venvelvitalai 232 natukal peeli sutti 221 nadukal ayinan 223 nadukal ayinan 306 nadukal kai tolutu 314 nadukal 329 putai nadukal 388 nanutai maravar cella nalisai peyarotu natta kal Menhir for a cattle retriever Menhir Menhir/ herostone Menhir/ herostone Menhir/ herostone Menhir/ herostone Menhir/ herostone with has relief Menhir/ herostone with has relief/ painting [3] 361</page><page sequence="4">4th-5th century A.D. The memorial stones are found with high concentration in the region of Dharmapuri and North Arcot, particularly in the'taluks of Chengam, Harur, Uttangarai, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri (Rajan 1997: 251-70). This region was ruled by the Athiyaman, Nannan and Malaiyaman lines of the Sangam period. Interestingly enough none of the memorial stones carry their names instead, but the names of the Pallava kings. All the evidence so far found in the form of ceramics, coins, seals, rings and rock beds belonging to the Sangam period contains the Tamil-Brahmi script, whereas the available memorial stones are engraved in vatteluttu script, which clearly indicates that they belong to the post Sangam period. Thus, the non-occurrence of Tamil-Brahmi script and the names of the Sangam Age rulers together with the occurrence of the vatteluttu script and of the names of the Pallava kings clearly establish the fact that they belong to the Pallava period only. Bearing this in mind, systematic explorations carried out in the northwestern parts of Tamil Nadu brought to light 274 memorial stones, of which 224 are inscribed and the rest are uninscribed (Table 2). These memorial stones are dated between the 5th century and 13th century A.D. Most of them belong to the Pallava period, i.e. to the 5th-9th century A.D. 362 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Although most of the memorial stones generally refer to the Pallava kings and are concentrated in the districts of Dharmapuri and Tiruvannamalai districts (Table 4), we hardly come across any memorial stones in the core Pallava region, in and around Kanchipuram. This concentration can be observed in the taluks of Chengam, Harur, Uttangarai, Krishnagiri and Kallakurichchi, all of which fall in the middle part of the Pennaiyar valley. Though the Pallavas fought a number of battles with the Chalukyas there are hardly any memorial stones in memory of their soldiers. Further, the Pallava kings did not prefer the vatteluttu script for their official work. Thus we may understand why the erection of memorial stones and usage of vatteluttu must have been confined to certain ethnic groups. It is noteworthy that only a few memorials speak of any genuine warfare between dynasties so well known to us, and that the rest confine themselves to the prosaic pattern of cattle raids and their rescue. Although the Tamil literary conventions held such cattle raids as a preliminary step leading to a battle between the two contending parties, the material evidence so far available fails to support this view. The political conditions that prevailed in the region were totally different from those found in the core Pallava region. Although the memorial stones refer to the region of the Pallava kings there is hardly any evidence to prove that the Pallava ruler was involved in their activities. The Pallavas did not interfere in the social life of the remote areas. Since the memorial stones are closely associated with the local people, they used the local dialect extensively. Thus any inferences from these memorial stones can reflect only the local activities confined to certain sub-regions. Territorial Division The recent explorations carried out in the Dharmapuri (Rajan 1991: 37-52), North Arcot (Rajan 1993 : 35-47) and South Arcot (Rajan 1997: 275-334) areas clearly indicate that the practice of erecting memorial stones is in fact an extension of the practices of the megalithic people who occupied this area prior to 3rd-4th century A.D. Therefore a close study of the Sangam literature coeval with the later phase of the megalithic phase and the lithic evidence of the memorials offer a good picture of the emergence of territorial divisions in this area (Table 5 and see Fig. 1).

The Sangam anthologie Akananuru (17, 44, 113, 325) gives some names like Nannan, Gangan, Katti, Adiyan and Pannan who were recognised as chiefs {vet) in this region. As we have seen, in the early stage the poet who spoke of the memorials as padukkai (megalithic cists) mentions only the clan name and not any king's or chiefs name (Table 2). Hence it seems that the clan leader who led the cattle raids later became a leader or vel.

The vatteluttu inscriptions give the names of territorial divisions like Mivenadu, Eyilnadu, Kilvenadu, Mikondrainadu, Puramalainadu, Palinadu, Ganganadu, Kovurnadu, Merkovilurnadu, etc., and the later memorial stones give the territorial division like Velkalinadu, Koyinurnadu, Thayanurnadu, Pangalanadu, Sirupalnadu, etc. In some cases the earlier ur (village) became the nucleus of a nadu, a territorial division incorporating several contiguous villages. For instance, the Sirupalur of the 6th century A.D. became Sirupalnadu in 9th- 10th century A.D. (Nagasamy 1957: 86) and Koyilur of the 7th century A.D. became Koyilurnadu in 9th century A.D. (Nagasamy 1975: 102). The geographical factors like the river course, size and position of the mountain, landscape, fertility of the soil and mineral wealth observed in the field work and the non-occurrence of any administrative terms in the memorial stone inscriptions suggest that this nadu division hardly played any administrative role. Similarly, the suffix /W/was just a village in the earlier stage, as in the case of Karungalipadi in Mivenadu (Nagasamy 1975: 113), Iramandaipadi in Merkovilurnadu (Nagasamy 1975: 51), etc. In later inscriptions, particularly from the 9th century onwards, we come across bigger territories with the padi suffix like Vanakopadi and Nulambapadi (Nagasamy 1975: 102).

The Mikondrainadu (southwestern part of Chengam taluk) and Merkovilurnadu (southeastern part of Chengam) were separated by the Pennaiyar river, which runs there from north to south. The Mikondrainadu and Mivenadu occupying the northern part of Chengam are again kept apart by the river Pennaiyar where it runs west to 366 [8]</page><page sequence="9">east. Mikondrainadu and Puramalainadu (western part of Harur taluk of Dharmapuri district) were separated by the Vaniyar, a tributary to the river Pennaiyar. Similarly, Ganganadu (western part of Uttangarai taluk of Dharmapuri district) and Minevadu were separated by the river Pambar, a tributary to Pennaiyar. Eyilnadu (Tiruppattur taluk) and Mivenadu were separated by the Javadi hills running between Chengam and Tiruppattur. The inscriptions available within a territorial division are sometimes confined to one ruler. The rulers like Perumbanaraisar and Vanakovaraisar ruled Venadu (Nagasamy 1975: 77) and Mikondrainadu (Nagasamy 1975: 54) respectively. Here too, till Mahendravarman's 20th regnal year only ur level rulers are mentioned rather than nadu rulers. The above inferences have been derived after subsequent to extensive field survey in the region. Location of each memorial stone has been plotted with geographical indicators so that territorial affinity could be easily assessed. REFERENCES Krishnamurthy, R. (1997) San gam Age Coins. Madras.
