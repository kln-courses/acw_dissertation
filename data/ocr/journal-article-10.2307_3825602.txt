Madden THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY* ERHAPS THE MOST GENERALLY ACCEPTED VIEW of the Victorian Age underlying modem studies of the period is that described (.. by a distinguished historian in these words: "The real difficulty in talking about the Victorian Age is not so much to get clear of all trails of deliberate malice as to avoid the foreshortening which affects all historical judgments. There was not one Victorian Age, there were at least three, and each of them continually changed shape and colour like a display of the Northern lights."1 A more recent remark, that it probably required as much energy in 1900 to embrace Christianity as in 18oo was required to reject it,2 provides one measure of the general *This essay is an expanded version of a paper read at the 1961 meeting of the English Institute at Columbia University. 1 E.

In Victorian England: Portrait of an Age (London, 1936), which traces the complexities and changes in the period, G. M. Young com- mented on the irony of Queen Victoria's name having been chosen "to impose an illu- sory show of continuity and uniformity on a tract of time where men and manners, sci- ence and philosophy, the fabric of social life and its directing ideas, changed more swiftly perhaps, and more profoundly, than they have ever changed in an age not sun- dered by a political or religious upheaval" (p. 181). G. S. R. Kitson Clark has recently reinforced this view in The Making of Victorian England (London, 1962): "The Queen's reign is a very long one in a period of swiftly moving change. It starts with bishops in cauliflower wigs and the great ones of the world driving in coaches with footmen behind, it ends with expensive people driving in motor cars and a leader of the House of Commons who rode a bicycle; it starts with gentlemen fighting duels, it ends with gentlemen playing golf, and all the time essential change in much more im- portant matters than these is rapidly going forward. Yet all this varied, violently con- trasted, rapidly changing life can be included in the one word Victorian" (p. 30). 2 Arthur J. Carr, Victorian Poetry: Clough to Kipling (New York, 1959), p. xi.

At the more quotidian level of manners and mores there were other changes: "apart from the conscious action of politicians or social reformers, the continual and ever-increasing rapidity of the Industrial Revolution was year by year silently trans- muting social habits, obliterating old distinctions of rank and creed, and turning a Bible-reading people with ideals based on reminiscences of rural or burgher life and a hierarchy of classes, into the city popula- tion that we know."3 After listing the manifold changes which had taken place between 1815 and 1914, a recent historian concluded: "No bal- ance sheet can be drawn up when the assets and liabilities are so tremendous. But the process by which they were accumulated and in- curred deserves study."4 The present essay attempts, within the con- text of this complex view of the Victorian cultural revolution, to trace the history of one element in that revolution: the Victorian sensi- bility. The term "sensibility" needs some explanation. It is used through- out the present essay in the sense given it some thirty years ago by T. S. Eliot when he wrote, "Sensibility alters from generation to generation in everybody, whether we will or no; but expression is only altered by a man of genius. A great many second-rate poets, in fact, are second- rate just for this reason, that they have not the sensitiveness and con- sciousness to perceive that they feel differently from the preceding gen- eration, and therefore must use words differently."5 As elsewhere in his writings, Eliot here attaches the name of "sensibility" to an integral and characteristic mode of thinking and feeling by which everyone struc- tures and evaluates his environment. Although the expression of sensi- bility is not confined to literature, it is appropriate that its definition should be taken from a man of letters. By the very nature of his enter- prise the writer is continuously engaged with the problem of creating an idiom adequate to expressing a particular way of thinking and feel- ing which originates, in part, in non-literary areas of experience; be- cause of this concern, he is likely to be more immediately conscious than his non-literary contemporaries of the ways in which sensibility has changed. The writer of genius is of particular interest, if Mr. Eliot's 3 G. M.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 68</page><page sequence="3">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY testimony can be accepted, in that he especially formulates the sensi- bility-type peculiar to his generation, that is to say, works out into lin- guistic statement a mode of structuring and evaluating environment which is shared by other sensitive members of his generation; the sen- sibility of this cultural "elite" in turn plays an important role in deter- mining the direction in which the sensibility of a whole society gradu- ally evolves. The first-rate literature of the Victorian period, it is there- fore assumed, offers the most direct available evidence regarding the nature of the Victorian sensibility.6 An adequate study of the Victorian sensibility, even in this lim- ited sense, is obviously impossible in a single essay.7 The present paper attempts, rather, within the framework of the assumptions implicit in Eliot's remark, to chart in broad outline the major shifts in English sen- sibility as these are reflected in the work of some of the major Vic- torian writers. The commentary on the evidence attempts to establish the nature and extent of the alterations in sensibility which are reflected in these authors during the three generations between 1830 and 1900. Because the impact of this "Victorian" revolution appears most dra- 6 In his admirable analysis of the major "shift" from the Neo-classic to the Romantic sensibility, Frederick A. Pottle has shown, in The Idiom of Poetry (Ithaca, N.Y., 1941), how changes in sensibility usually occur, after the manner of linguistic shifts, with a certain internal logic and consistency of direction, although the causes behind the changes, even when they are identifiable, may lie outside the province of literature proper (see esp. ch. i). There is considerable cultural lag in the process; the second- rate writers, exploiting a style previously created by a writer of genius, carry on the work of forming in others the sensibility of which that idiom had been the original ex- pression, long after that idiom has been displaced by a more original mode of expression better adapted to the altered sensibility of the new generation. For purposes of this essay the voluminous literature of the period belonging in Eliot's category of the sec- ond-rate is relevant only in so far as it helps to define, by contrast, the more original and formative sensibilities expressed by the first-rate writers, who were aware that they felt and thought differently from their predecessors and who were able to make such differences felt in the language. 7 A number of studies have touched, directly or indirectly, on the Victorian sensibility; I am indebted especially to Raymond Williams' Culture and Society, 1780-1950 (New York, 1958), Walter E. Houghton's Victorian Frame of Mind, 1830-1870 (New Haven, Conn., 1957), and Jerome H. Buckley's The Victorian Temper, A Study in Literary Culture (Cambridge, Mass., 1951). Williams provides an excellent definition of sensi- bility in his later book, The Long Revolution (London, 1961), in his discussion of what he calls "structure of feeling": "I do not mean that the structure of feeling, any more than the social character, is possessed in the same way by the many individuals in the community. But I think it is a very deep and very wide possession, in all actual communities, precisely because it is on it that communication depends. And what is particularly interesting is that it does not seem to be, in any formal sense, learned. One generation may train its successor ... in the . . . general cultural pattern, but the new generation will have its own structure of feeling, which will not appear to have come 'from' anywhere. For here, most distinctly, the changing organization is enacted in the organism: the new generation responds in its own ways to the unique world it is in- heriting, taking up many continuities, that can be traced and reproducing many aspects of the organi7ation, which can be separately described, yet feeling its whole life in certain ways differently, and shaping its creative response into a new structure of feeling" (pp. 48-49).

Madden matically in the contrast between the Romantic and Moder modes of aesthetic perception which bracket the Victorian Age proper, modes which M. H. Abrams has described as "at opposite poles,"8 a prelimi- nary description of the difference between these modes will provide a useful frame for studying what occurred in the intervening decades. For reasons to be indicated, I have taken Wordsworth as representative of the pre-Victorian, Romantic sensibility, and Yeats as representative of the post-Victorian, Modem sensibility, using the poetry of the former as a convenient point of departure and the poetry of the latter as the terminus ad quem. Brief excursions beyond purely literary matters ap- pear at the beginning of each section and will indicate why I believe the sensibility expressed in the literature of the period has implications that bear on our understanding of other areas of Victorian experience as well. I Wordsworth may be taken as representative of the Romantic sensibility not so much because he exercised a powerful influence on the Victorians, but primarily because he was, in Douglas Bush's phrase, the "most germinal" Romantic poet.9 The potentially contradictory ten- dencies present in English Romantic literature were fused by Words- worth in creative equilibrium through the exercise of what the poet himself called an "organic" or "natural" sensibility. This peculiar capac- ity to unify the heterogeneous elements in English Romanticism was due in part to Wordsworth's absolute faith that man and nature were - in the language of the 1800 Preface - "essentially adapted to each other."'0 The Promethean rebelliousness so important in the responses of Shelley and Byron is not altogether absent from Wordsworth's writ- ings, as some of the latter's critical pronouncements show, but in Words- worth the Romantic exaltation of the mind's creative powers is consistently qualified by a complementary awareness of external "pres- ences" which constitute an inescapable Other, against which it is self- destructive to rebel. Several experimental passages of verse in the 1804 notebook, in which Wordsworth searched for an adequate statement of his crucial experience on Mount Snowdon, show a passive and recep- 8 In a review of Frank Kermode's The Romantic Image, in VS, II (1958), 76. 9 English Poetry (New York, 1963), p. 132.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 70</page><page sequence="5">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY tive as well as an active and aggressive impulse at work, the two impulses operating together "organically" in an experience which is char- acterized by the simultaneous discovery of the Self and of this Other: To feed his soul upon infinity To deal with whatso'er be dim or vast In his own nature [blending] in a form Of unity through truth inspiring thoughts By one sensation, either be it that Of his own mind the power by which he thinks Or lastly the great feeling of the world God and the immortality of life Beneath all being evermore to be.ll In another passage from the same notebook the poet is described as "a brooding spirit" who must not only be "willing to work" but be capable also of being "wrought upon" and thus enter "the better awful pres- ences." In giving poetic expression to the experience of that "something far more deeply interfused" which made possible a reciprocal action between man and the universe around him, Wordsworth broke with the attitudes of eighteenth-century rationalism regarding nature's passivity and man's autonomy and self-sufficiency, creating a new way of think- ing and feeling which exercised a profound influence, in England at least, through the rest of the century. The relative "orthodoxy" of the Wordsworthian sensibility, com- pared either to the Romantic modes of his contemporaries or to what came after with the Victorians, is evident in his criticism and poetry alike. The Essay, Supplementary to the Preface distinguishes "between religion - making up the deficiencies of reason by faith; and poetry - passionate for the instruction of reason" (Literary Criticism, p. 172). The context of this distinction was Wordsworth's desire to warn readers against the popular pietistic verse of the day and to distinguish the conventional rhetoric of such verses from genuine poetry. By itself, however, the statement clearly implies a subordination of poetry to a religious faith which for Wordsworth, when he came to think about it, meant Christianity; the highest poetry of all he identifies with that poetry contained in the "grand storehouses of enthusiastic and medi- tative Imagination, of poetical, as contra-distinguished from human and dramatic Imagination," namely, in "the prophetic and lyrical parts of the Holy Scriptures, and the works of Milton; to which I cannot fore- 11 Quoted by Helen Darbishire, "Wordsworth's Conception of the Poetic Mind," Times Literary Supplement, 18 Oct. 1957, p. 632.

Madden bear to add those of Spenser," after which he dismisses the pagan reli- gions of antiquity as too "anthropomorphic" to inspire this highest poetry (Literary Criticism, p. 162). The extent to which the traditional religious frame of reference shaped even the early Wordsworth's sensi- bility is indicated by Coleridge's remark in 1817 that the poetic diction which Wordsworth supposedly borrowed from 'low and rustic" life was for the most part the language of Englishmen who had been brought up on the Bible, the hymnbook, and the liturgy.12 Looking back from the other end of the century, Yeats found much to admire in English Romanticism, particularly in the work of Blake and Shelley. His writings, however, reflect the disturbing impact of the events which separated his own England from the Eng- land of the young Wordsworth. "How," he asked in 1900, "can the arts overcome the slow dying of men's hearts that we call the progress of the world, and lay their hands upon the heart-strings again, without becoming the garment of religion as in old times?"13 Taken by itself, the question might be given a Wordsworthian interpretation, but from Yeats's life and writings we know that "religion" meant something far different to him in 1900 from what it had meant to Wordsworth in 1815. The Yeatsian sensibility was marked, I would say, by an inwardness and self-consciousness that accompanied a strong religious impulse which has had to re-direct itself along the lines indicated by the Auto- biography. "I am very religious," Yeats wrote in an often-quoted pas- sage, "and deprived by Huxley and Tyndall, whom I detested, of the simple-minded religion of my childhood, I had made a new religion, almost an infallible church of poetic tradition."l4 For Yeats it was poetry rather than religion that made up the deficiencies of reason; religion, as Wordsworth had conceived it, was for the later poet simply the poetry of an "antithetical" phase of Western history which Yeats saw as draw- ing to an end in his own day. The remark of a modern critic that "only men who are committed to perverse illusion or to public oratory believe that we have a Christian civilization today"15 could be applied with equal cogency to the England of Yeats, but not, at least not with the same confidence, to the England of Wordsworth. "All civilization," Yeats could write, "is held together... by artificially created illusions" (Autobiography, p. 326), and the "consciously dramatic" expression in his mature poetry of this fundamental tenet underlying the Modern 12 Biographia Literaria, ed.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 72</page><page sequence="7">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY sensibility manifested a more general alteration in Western culture which Wordsworth could scarcely have anticipated. Between 18o0 and 19oo intellectual and moral assent had shifted from an order outside and prior to the self to an order, so far as there was order at all, that had to be created from within and was coextensive with the self. The latter position was latent in the Promethean ten- dencies of early English Romanticism: Nothing can Quench the mind, if the mind will be itself And centre of surrounding things - 'tis made To sway.16 In such lines Byron may be thought of as sowing the seed of the more radical Prometheanism of Yeats: I mock Plotinus' thought And cry in Plato's teeth, Death and life were not Till man made up the whole, Made lock, stock and barrel Out of his bitter soul, Aye, sun and moon and star, all.17 But the difference in their respective psychological stances and in the structure of feeling which informs their poetry is nevertheless great. The sensibility of Byron functions, even in its rebellion, within inherited categories of feelings and the belief that poetry is still a public art. "In my mind," he wrote in 1821, "the highest of all poetry is ethical poetry, as the highest of all earthly objects must be moral truth."'8 The sensi- bility of Yeats, on the other hand, was organized as though values which had once been the basis of poetry and civilized existence may once have been true, so far as anything is ever true, but were so no longer. For Yeats the "Unity of Culture in class and people," which he believed indispensable for "true Unity of Being," seemed "no longer possible at all" (Autobiography, pp. 235-236); and in any case poetry had nothing to do with ethics. Art for Yeats still burned, but its flame no longer singed the sleeve. The difference between the Romantic and the Moder sensi- bility can be stated in another way.

I cannot do other- wise without unsettling the very foundations of my own moral nature."'9 A hundred years later Yeats took the opposite position in a passage which, appropriately enough, contains a critical comment on Words- worth: If we cannot imagine ourselves as different from what we are and assume the second self, we cannot impose a discipline upon ourselves, though we may accept one from others. Active virtue as distinguished from the passive acceptance of the current code is therefore theatrical, consciously dramatic, the wearing of a mask... Wordsworth is often flat and heavy, partly because his moral sense has no theatrical element, it is an obedience to a discipline which he has not created.20 By 1900 there was no discipline, either to obey or disobey; for a Modem poet like Yeats even that against which rebellion might be directed had itself first to be created, and this explains his inversion of Wordsworth's preference for the "enthusiastic and meditative" over the "human and dramatic" imagination. Not even Keats, conscious though he was at times of the sacrifice of personal identity which poetry seemed to re- quire, could have understood the deliberate and systematic cultiva- tion of the mask which was the psychological basis of Yeats's later poetry. Orthodox Early Victorians were quick to seize upon the impli- cations in Coleridge's claim regarding Wordsworth's diction, hopefully interpreting the Romantic revolution in sensibility as a sign of an incipi- ent revival of Christianity.21 It became increasingly clear, however, that Wordsworth's poetic intuition could not by itself support a Christian theodicy, did not, that is, require it, however compatible it might be with it when that intuition became intellectually conscious of itself in 19 Aids to Reflection, preliminary to the "Aphorisms on Spiritual Religion," para. 7, Complete Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. W. G. T. Shedd (New York, 1894), I, 193. 20 Autobiography, pp. 319-320. Yeats applies the distinction to Shelley and Tennyson also: "When Shelley wrote The Cenci . . . when Tennyson wrote Beckett, they were, I argued with Todhunter, deliberately oratorical; instead of creating drama in the mood of The Lotus Eaters, or of Epipsychidion they had tried to escape their characteristics, had thought of the theatre as outside the general movement of literature"; see Letters to the New Island, ed. Horace Reynolds (Cambridge, Mass., 1934), p. 168. 21 See L. E. Elliott-Binns, Religion in the Victorian Era (London, 1946), p. 104, for the general influence of Romanticism on religion. On Wordsworth's early influence at Ox- ford see Justus Coleridge's letter to Dean Stanley in the Life and Correspondence of Thomas Arnold, D.D. (New York, 1844), I, 30. Henry Crabb Robinson later com- plained that the Puseyites claimed Wordsworth "as their poet." Wordsworth himself spoke of Frederick Faber, the Tractarian poet who later converted to Catholicism and opened a London Oratory under Newman, "as having more than any other man known to him, a sympathy with Nature, like his own" (Ronald Chapman, Father Faber [West- minster, Md., 1961], pp. 68-69). VICTORIAN STUDIES 74</page><page sequence="9">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY Wordsworth's own mind. One of the more momentous consequences of the Victorian experience was the discovery of this fact, a discovery which helps to explain the radical difference between the "organic" poetry composed by Wordsworth before 1815 and the "modem" poetry composed by Yeats after 1900. The evolution of the Victorian sensibil- ity, seen in the context of this difference, displays a continuity and pattern that help to define some of the elements which went into the making of "Victorianism." II According to Pottle, the great shift from Neo-classic to Romantic began while Pope was at the height of his powers and by the time of the publication of Lyrical Ballads had not yet gone very far, as the reception of that volume indicates. It was Scott and Byron who "loosened the snow, and the avalanche came down, one would guess, not much be- fore 1830" (Pottle, p. 43). The alteration in the English cultural land- scape which became evident in the early 'thirties was not confined to literature. The opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway in 1830 and the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832 were further symptoms of a general change which left more thoughtful Early Victorians anxious. The forces of change, only some of which were recognized at the time, had created a society poised on a double paradox and uncertain as to how to deal with the challenge: "Its practical ideals were at odds with its religious professions and its religious belief was at issue with its in- telligence."22 Under the pressures of the new challenge and the inner uncertainty as to how to respond to it, the openness and eagerness of the Romantic generation quickly evaporated. The mixed destinies of Wordsworth and Byron were indicative of what had happened in the literary sphere. By 1832 Wordsworth had overtaken Byron in the esteem of the reading public.23 The significance 22 Young, p. 16. D. G. James remarks in The Romantic Comedy (London, 1948) that "what strikes the imagination is the quick, hurried, and agitated rhythm of the move- ment of Romanticism in England. It seems so short a time from the joy of Blake, and the revolutionary and sanguine ardour of Wordsworth and Coleridge, to the disillusion and wisdom of Wordsworth and Coleridge in their later years, and Newman" (p. 271). 23 Amy Cruse suggests, in The Englishman and His Books in the Early Nineteenth Cen- tury (New York, n.d.), pp. 53-54, that the turn from Byron to Wordsworth occurred between 1822 and 1825; further, Samuel Chew, in Byron in England (New York, 1924), p. 260, quotes T. W. Reid's Life of Lord Houghton: "There was something . . . in the moral spirit of Wordsworth, as well as of Shelley, which touched the hearts of the Cambridge youth of that period [the late 1820's], and led them to revolt against the worship of Byron, which was then almost supreme in the literary world." SEPTEMBER 1963 75</page><page sequence="10">William A. Madden of this change in literary taste lay in the fact that Wordsworth's poetry operated powerfully on behalf of traditional attitudes which Byron and Shelley had questioned. Byron, the aristocratic critic of society who spoke as a "defiant rebellious child of Evangelical and Calvinistic Prot- estantism, feeling the power of the doctrine he defied,"24 became em- blematic of a dilemma which confronted the Victorians. The Byronic predicament, that of possessing "a religious sense that would not be stifled, and a creed the intellect could not accept,"25 anticipated the widespread tension throughout the Victorian decades between an in- tense desire to believe and strong intellectual doubts that made any comprehensive belief difficult. In this predicament, as the testimony of Mill, Arnold, George Eliot, Hale White, Stephen, and others indicates, Wordsworth's "healing" message seemed to offer a refuge. Meanwhile, however, a new sensibility, neither Wordsworthian nor Byronic, had begun to find expression. The sensibility created by the double paradox of Early Victorian society manifested itself in literature in a curious new relationship be- tween what might be called the "public" and "private" voices of Early Victorian writers. The "public" voice expressed a will to believe that dominated the dialogue between the writer and his audience, the bur- den of which was the attempt to find religious or moral or philosophical sanctions adequate to practical social needs and ideals. The "private" voice, on the other hand, betrayed the precariousness of belief that dominated the writer's dialogue with himself, the burden of which was the writer's consciousness of the latent incompatibilities between his private doubts regarding the validity of such sanctions and his public role as "sage." The "public" voice in its most obvious, least complicated mode was expressed by Macaulay: "We firmly believe that, in spite of all the misgovernment of her rulers, the nation has almost constantly become richer and richer. Now and then there has been a stoppage, now and then a short retrogression; but as to the general tendency there can be no doubt. A single breaker may recede; but the tide is evidently coming in."26 Although the accent and premises were different, a sim- ilar note of affirmation and hope was struck by Carlyle: "Man has joined himself with man; soul acts and reacts on soul; a mystic miraculous 24 H. J. C. Grierson, The Background of English Literature (London, 1925), p. 191. 25 Grierson, p. 199. Grierson goes on to make the point that "such solution as Byron found had in it the essential elements of Tolstoi's teaching - work and self-sacrifice." 26 "Southey's Colloquies," The Life and Works of Lord Macaulay (London, 1897), V, 366. VICTORIAN STUDIES 76</page><page sequence="11">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY unfathomable Union establishes itself; Life, in all its elements, has be- come intensated, consecrated."27 The "private" voice, as expressed by the same two writers in passages approximately contemporaneous with those just cited, strikes an altogether different note. When a younger sister to whom he was very close was engaged to be married, Macaulay wrote to another sister, in the midst of the celebration of his victory at the polls at Leeds, "Dearest, dearest sister, you alone are now left me. Whom have I on earth but thee? But for you, in the midst of all these successes, I should wish that I was lying by poor Hyde Villiers."28 This was in 1832. Two years earlier Carlyle had made the following entry in his diary: "My memory . . . has failed sadly of late years (principally the last two): yet not so much by defect in faculty, I should say, as by want of earnestness in using it. I attend to few things as I was wont: few things have any interest for me: I live in a sort of waking dream."29 The contrast reflects something more than a fluctuation of mood. The two sets of passages express distinct responses to the new consciousness of impersonal social and technological forces - what Carlyle called Public Opinion and Machinery - as independent powers in their own right. On the one side, there was a sense of liberation and optimism; on the other, a profound sense of the effort of intelligence and will that would be required to create and maintain order against the threat of political chaos without or of psychic defeat within which these new powers represented. In the ensuing struggle the Early Victorian intelli- gence proved to be a two-edged sword, often consuming energy and undercutting convictions without offering anything commensurate in return. John Stuart Mill's "I seemed to have nothing left to live for" is echoed by John Henry Newman's "I lost my natural and inborn faith ... then ... my simple confidence in the word of God."30 It would be possible, but misleading I believe, to analyze these opposed voices as a late manifestation of the "dissociated sensibility" which Eliot has traced back to the Renaissance, that is, in terms of a 27 "Characteristics," Critical and Miscellaneous Essays, Centenary Edition (New York, 1900), III, 11. 28 G.

These notebooks show Carlyle engaged in a struggle which has been described by Eric Bentley in A Century of Hero-Worship (Boston, 1957), as the problem of "transfer- ring his religious feelings to his new religion of power." "A rough sort of armistice would be patched up between his religious sentiments and his secular sentiments. But there is also much that is contradictory, much that is blurred and imprecise, in Car- lyle's writings. He was attempting the impossible task of concealing and resolving the conflict at the same time" (p. 69). 30 John Stuart Mill, Autobiography (London, 1873), p. 134; John Henry Newman: Autobiographical Writings, ed.

Madden simple dichotomy caused by a sensibility that thinks and feels by starts.31 The great Early Victorian writers - those who can be described in Eliot's terms as having "the sensitiveness and consciouness to per- ceive that they feel differently" - express rather a sensibility in which reason and emotion, doubt and faith, optimism and foreboding qualify one another to produce a tertium quid. The "public" voice in Sartor Resartus, Tennyson's early poems, Mill's essays on poetry, Vanity Fair, and Newman's sermons is qualified by the "wound or cancer" in the mind, as Newman called it (p. 245), which is recorded in numerous Early Victorian diaries, letters, and notebooks.32 Thackeray repeatedly commented in his diary for the period from 1831 to 1833 on "the paraly- sis of will and the atrophy of moral feeling that threatened him."33 His sustained self-analysis was in part a result of a fear of sinking to the bottom of the social scale if he did not take a firmer hand with himself, and in part the result of his loss of his religious convictions earlier at Cambridge, under the influence of Edward FitzGerald, who was later to translate the Rubdiyat. Thackeray's "state of restless bewilderment concerning religion" (Ray, p. 132) was to become an increasingly com- mon Victorian phenomenon; as Carlyle put it, "Doubt, which . . . ever hangs in the background of our world, has now become our middle- ground and foreground" (Essays, III, 28). This doubt gave to the widely different commitments of the Early Victorian "sages" a quality missing from earlier English literature: a sense of urgency, of willed effort, of the need to persuade by style and "presence" as well as by argument, which originated in the knowledge that an avalanche had indeed descended and the foundations of society might give way.34 It explains why, after 1830, the eye of the writer was 31 See "The Metaphysical Poets," Selected Essays (New York, 1950), esp. pp. 245-249. 32 One portion of this literature expressed a conventional "public" voice in numerous reli- gious epics imitative of Milton or in pious lyrics, hymns, and sermons, all of which were morally didactic in the manner to which Wordsworth himself turned in his later years. The "private" voice, on the other hand, was represented, equally unsatisfactorily, by the poetry of the Spasmodics whose sensibility was marked by what a contemporary critic called, with a reference to Byron, "a diseased subtlety of introspective thought"; see George Gilfillan, A Gallery of Literary Portraits (London, n.d.), p. 57. Buckley notes the influence of Byron among the Spasmodics in The Victorian Temper (pp. 41-42). 33 Gordon N. Ray, Thackeray: The Uses of Adversity, 1811-1846 (New York, 1955), p. 164. 34 The impact of the new sensibility on prose style was very complicated and cannot be discussed here. Although Macaulay had moments of self-awareness, he never admitted as much to his audience and he paid the price of having a brilliant but mind-paralyzing style. If one had to select a representative critic it would have to be Carlyle, whose influence was so great and whose method of composition exactly reflected the two components of the Early Victorian sensibility. As late as Past and Present, he em- ployed in his first drafts the rhythm and idiom of eighteenth-century prose which had marked his early prose; this was the natural idiom in which to express his loss of faith VICTORIAN STUDIES 78</page><page sequence="13">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY no longer on the object in Wordsworth's simple sense; at the extremes, it was either, as with Thomas Arnold, on the new and threatening audi- ence, or, as with the Carlyle and Mill of the autobiographies, on a self in danger of losing the capacity to feel. The sudden "politicization" of literature and the enormous rush of energy - in style as well as in the quantity of the works produced - were inspired not only by an aware- ness of "society" as such, but more particularly by concern over how to advise a large middle-class audience anxious to be led and to lead in a milieu in which the ground-note was change. At the same time, there was a growing and disturbing sense of having to contend, in an increas- ingly pluralist society, against a host of alternative private visions; consciousness of the idiosyncratic, chosen, private nature of one's own position was inescapable.35 Mill recognized the two voices when he identified audience-regarding literature with "eloquence" and self- regarding literature with "poetry." "Eloquence," he wrote, "supposes an audience; the peculiarity of poetry appears to us to lie in the poet's utter unconsciousness of a listener."36 This was the Early Victorian version of Yeats's later distinction between the quarrel with the self which produced poetry and the quarrel with others which produced rhetoric. Because the Early Victorians still hoped for some comprehensive resolu- tion, the two voices emerged as the writer attended to both audience and self, needing urgently to persuade and, simultaneously, to question and analyze. The literary genre characteristic of the Early Victorian sensibil- ity might therefore be described, in Mill's terms, as "eloquent poetry," a genre capable of including prose or verse indiscriminately. Poetry, however, was the natural medium in which the Early Victorian quarrel with the self could find its purest statement, and the relevant poet of the 'thirties and 'forties, of course, was Tennyson, in whose work the two voices assumed various relationships to one another as he attempted to transcend the painful paradox underlying Early Victorian experi- in the Calvinism of his parents. Unable to rest in skepticism, he elaborated upon the rational base his famous metaphorical-biblical mode as the appropriate and persuasive idiom of the Everlasting Yea. Like the poetry of the Spasmodics, Carlyle's public prose disguised but could not altogether conceal the radical break with Romanticism which had taken place. Both in its affirmations and in its misgivings, his early work expressed the ambivalence that characterizes the literature of the 'thirties and 'forties. On Carlyle's compositional method, see Grace J. Calder, The Writing of "Past and Present": A Study of Carlyle's Manuscripts (New Haven, Conn., 1949). 35 On this point see the chapter "Romanticism as a Modern Tradition," in Robert Lang- baum's The Poetry of Experience (New York, 1957), esp. pp. 21-22. 36 "Thoughts on Poetry and Its Varieties," Dissertations and Discussions (London, 1867), I, 71.

Madden ence.37 A residual Romantic faith in the mind's intuitive powers survives in the aggressive and occult statements in "The Poet's Mind" or "The Hesperides." On the other hand, there is a new and corrosive self-ques- tioning in poems like "The Two Voices" and "The Palace of Art," in which both impulses appear, violently juxtaposed but unreconciled. The resulting conflict had various effects on the poet - the frustration and longing for death expressed in "Tithonus," the search for experience and adventure in "Ulysses," the drift into irresponsible languor in "The Lotus Eaters." In In Memoriam, finally, the whole gamut of these emo- tions is recapitulated, the persona winning through in the end by a powerful effort of will to that trust in a larger hope which is held with an intensity directly proportionate to its tentativeness and vagueness. Unlike Wordsworth's Prelude - the autobiography of the poet's mind recollecting an unforgettable vision and a glory - In Memoriam is the private epic of a soul asserting its tenacious hope against great odds in a narrow place, giving monumental expression to the essential Tenny- sonian theme of "a reiterated sense of loss that becomes idyllic self- assurance."38 The "idyllic" quality of the self-assurance is suggested by the subsequent appearance of the Idylls of the King, of which it has been said that "its metaphysic could not present nor its withdrawing poetic imagination conceive an end sufficient to the means."39 Through- out Tennyson's poetry the precariousness of the self-assured "public" voice is betrayed by the persistence of a pervasive and more convincing private voice conveying a sense of loss and desolation. In one of the few perceptive works of literary criticism from the period, Tennyson's friend Arthur Hallam analyzed the shift from the Wordsworthian center discernible in Tennyson's poetry. Having commented on the Romantic generation's attempt to "bring our over- civilized condition of thought into union with the fresh productive spirit that brightened the morning of our literature," Hallam sadly concluded that "repentance is unlike innocence; the laborious endeavour to restore has more complicated methods of action than the freedom of untainted nature."40 The Early Victorian literature of genius consistently displays 37 Buckley remarks that Tennyson's conflict, "though highly individual, was also broadly typical of the conflict which all major Victorian artists had to face. In his early work we see both the Spasmodic impulse that culminated in Maud and the 'anti-romantic' bias that produced a sociological aesthetic" (The Victorian Temper, p. 68). E. D. H. Johnson, in The Alien Vision of Victorian Poetry (Princeton, 1952), also distinguishes between the "public" and "private" aspects of Tennyson's poetry (pp. 3-21). 38 Arthur J.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 80</page><page sequence="15">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY precisely the 'laborious endeavour to restore" which accounts for the new "self-consciousness" in literature noticed by Carlyle and Mill. In his "picturesque" rendering of the isolated soul, stifling amidst the beauties and nightmares of its Palace of Art and going down into the valley of society for fresh air, Tennyson introduced the new sensibility into English poetry and, like Wordsworth before him, authoritatively defined the dominant structure of thought and feeling for his genera- tion. III Measured against the confusion of the 'thirties and 'forties and the much different kind of confusion that was to follow, the 'fifties and 'sixties represent a period of equipoise and relative stability.41 Many who had lived through the turbulent earlier decades must have shared the feeling recorded by Macaulay in his journal upon the closing of the Great Exhibition: "This will long be remembered as a singularly happy year, of peace, plenty, good feeling, innocent pleasure, national glory of the best and purest sort."42 Politically, at any rate, the national threat of "mass" democracy which had alarmed many in 1830 and 1848 had by 1851 come to seem a mere problem, a question of means and gradual melioration. So far as literature was concerned, this reassuring aspect of the Mid-Victorian experience fostered a more compatible relation- ship between writers and their expanding audience. Even when it preached, Mid-Victorian literature was calmer, more expansive, and more confident on the whole than that of the Early Victorians. But the confidence and calm were largely on the surface. Politi- cal complacency was soon disturbed by events in the Crimea and India, 41 The terminology here is taken from W. L. Burn's survey of the period, "The Age of Equi- poise: England 1848-1868," Nineteenth Century and After, CXLVI (1949), 207-224. Asa Briggs, in his Victorian People: A Reassessment of Persons and Themes, 1851- 1867 (Chicago, 1954), says, "The picturesque battles of the nineteenth century fall on either side of the period [from 1851 to 1867]. On the one side, there are the sharp conflicts of the 1840's . . . and, on the other side, there are the bitter struggles of the i88o's.... The middle years of the century form a great plateau bounded on each side by deep ravines and dangerous precipices" (p. i). 42 Trevelyan, Life and Letters, II, 183.

SEPTEMBER 1963 81</page><page sequence="16">William A. Madden while in literature Tennyson's newly acquired status was already being questioned. Matthew Arnold later recalled that Tennyson had begun to displace Wordsworth as a poetic influence in the early 'forties.43 By 1850 the new Laureate had become a national figure and his enormous prestige was reinforced and extended by such later publications as the Idylls of the King and Enoch Arden. But fame and the Laureateship came to Tennyson after his formative experience was already well be- hind him; his reiteration of the hard-won trust definitively expressed in In Memoriam could not alter the fact that the sensibility of the new generation had changed. As early as 1849, Arnold himself was rebelling against the increasingly refined but essentially fixed Tennysonian idiom.44 In 1864 Gerard Manley Hopkins probably spoke for other sen- sitive readers when he wrote to a friend: "Do you know, a horrible thing has happened to me. I have begun to doubt Tennyson."45 The nature of the change in sensibility implicit in Hopkins' dis- covery is partially indicated by the later history of two important ele- ments in Tennyson's poetry, its "picturesque" technique and its moral content. Lacking the kind of faith which had enabled Wordsworth to assimilate the contradiction inherent in the Romantic attempt con- sciously to restore a lost spontaneity, Tennyson had raised the contra- diction to the level of consciousness. As a poet he had been aware of and at times given voice to a "demonic" impulse, yielding himself up to a Fantastic beauty; such as lurks In some wild poet, when he works Without a conscience or an aim.46 But more often than not, particularly after 185o, the "oracular" Tenny- son was overshadowed by Tennyson the moralist who was very much conscious of his audience and of his quasi-official relationship to it and who played down the "demonic," asserting instead the need for ethical mastery over it. This ethical strain Tennyson expressed in quotable sententiae which appealed powerfully to his large Mid-Victorian pub- lic. Although their content, as Francis Thompson put it, was neither very profound nor very pregnant, these memorabilia had an extraneous 43 Essays in Criticism: Second Series (London, 1880), pp. 122-123. 44 See The Letters of Matthew Arnold to Arthur Hugh Clough, ed.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 82</page><page sequence="17">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY dignity and buried themselves in the memory "like a harpoon."47 In other hands, both Tennysonian elements suffered a fatal diminishing: in Tupper, Samuel Smiles, and numerous moralizers in verse, the man- ner as well as the matter of the sententiae became facile, while the "pic- turesque" technique was taken over by "word-painters" who adopted Tennyson's habit of closely attending to natural details but lacked the introspective power to make such details poetically relevant.48 While the main features of the Tennysonian sensibility were being disseminated, at a much diminished level of self-consciousness, by the second-rate writers, the more self-conscious and original Mid- Victorians turned to other techniques to pursue the essential Tenny- sonian quest. At its best Tennyson's poetry had brilliantly exploited a "picturesque" mode that conformed to Mill's conception of poetry's function as a medium for communicating states of sensibility, the poet defining mood and feeling in terms of "psychological landscapes," his sensibility objectifying itself in the texture, shape, color, or motion of objects in the outer world in a way that Ruskin would later identify with the "pathetic fallacy."49 Behind Tennyson's technique there had been the unprecedented attempt to know one's subjectivity perfectly, that is, to make of subjectivity itself an object, and this attempt was taken over by the major Mid-Victorian writers, who pursued it in the context of a Mid-Victorian environment which required new techniques. Having witnessed the inconclusive debate of the Early Victorian sages, Arnold, Clough, Dickens, Browning, Meredith, and George Eliot abandoned Tennyson's interest in mystical "gleams" as well as the Romantic claims to a key to the universe, whether in religious or metaphysical systems or in titanic emotional thrusts at the Infinite.50 In thus lessening their denominator, they discovered a new hope based on a residual faith in 47 The Real Robert Louis Stevenson and Other Critical Essays by Francis Thompson, ed. Terence L. Connolly (New York, 1959), P. 170. 48 Humphry House has analyzed the result: "It was by means of the patient accumulation of fact that the Victorians domesticated mystery, made Romanticism respectable. From that point two attitudes developed: one was the purely scientific, for which the facts were all - as they were for Darwin - facts loved with a lingering passion. The other was a sentimental love of fact, for the sake of what could be easily attached to it in the way of belief and feeling.... Victorian sentimentality is largely the imposition of feeling as an afterthought upon literalness" (Ideas and Beliefs of the Victorians, p. 223). House also suggests a possible motive: "Man was dwarfed by the new concep- tion of [geological] time and had to exaggerate his morality and his sentiment in order to restore his self-esteem" (p. 224). 49 See the third volume of Modern Painters (London, 1856), Pt.

This empiricizing of moral feeling in turn supplied inward grounds for a confidence which the prosperity, political stability, and general opti- mism of the age served to reinforce externally. The confident side of the Mid-Victorian sensibility found its nat- ural mode in the moralism that inspired detailed prose portraits of char- acter in scenes from social life which filled the pages both of novels and of novel-like narrative poems - the latter exemplified by Aurora Leigh (1857), Modern Love (1862), Enoch Arden (1864), and The Ring and the Book (1868-69). "Actionl - actionl" Meredith said of Evan Har- rington, "- he sighed for it, as I have done since I came to know that his history must be morally developed."'5 The exploration of the origin and happy growth of the moral sentiment of "sympathy" - or of the conse- quences of its tragic frustration-was conducted in both prose and verse in the deep conviction that this sentiment was really there, poten- tially at any rate, in all members of English society, irrespective of ra- tional or dogmatic formulations or of the reader's social status. George Eliot, whose agnosticism was endemic to the period, was representative at least in this: discussing the religious and philosophical disagreements of the age, she declared that the true criterion in all such matters was not "agreement between intellects" but "truth of feeling."52 Whereas the best Early Victorian literature wavered between extreme forms of doubt and belief in the debate that attended the threat- ened disappearance of religious and metaphysical sanctions, Mid-Vic- torian literature accepted a general religious and metaphysical agnosticism as the background to its confident expression of the empirical moral premise. In maintaining the Romantic orientation to- wards experience of the "heart," therefore, the Mid-Victorian sensibility no longer responded to this experience out of any faith in the heart's oneness with the universe, but out of a less ambitious faith in its ethical power as the source of benevolent moral sentiments which could bind man to man in the entangling, necessary, always precarious web of social involvement. For the Mid-Victorian novelist "truth of feeling" was thus interpreted as a moral and social rather than as a cosmic and tran- scendental truth; under the pressure of this narrowed faith nature itself was given a moral function, the very "inexpressiveness" of the universe, as Bagehot called it, providing a suitable stage for the moral drama of 51 Evan Harrington, ch. xxxvi, Works of George Meredith, Memorial Edition (New York, 1909-12), VI, 457. 52 The George Eliot Letters, ed.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 84</page><page sequence="19">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY Humanity.53 The subtle alteration in sensibility brought about by this empiricizing of moral feelings is evident in George Eliot's description of the view which she took of her audience: The act of writing... brings with it the vague, delightful illusion of an audience nearer to my idiom than the Cherokees, and more numerous than the visionary One for whom many authors have declared themselves willing to go through the pleasing punishment of publication.... I imagine a far-off, hazy, multitudinous assemblage . . . making an approving chorus to the sentences and paragraphs of which I myself particularly enjoy the writing. The haze is a necessary condition. If any physiognomy becomes distinct in the foreground, it is fatal.54 Unlike the "subjective" writer described by Browning in his essay on Shelley, the Mid-Victorian novelist did not compose for the "visionary One"; he not only was aware of but in a very important way depended upon his audience, that is, upon the reality of the moral solidarity of civilized society and its "approving chorus." In her detailed histories of her heroes and heroines George Eliot recreates the very act by which she herself, following the discipline of sympathetic feeling, has won possession of her own subjectivity and has mastered its irrational po- tencies; the reader was assumed willing to relive as far as his powers of perception allowed, this process of moral self-definition. Through a commitment to the premise that an audience could share, and by sharing come to understand, the sensibility revealed by the writer's delicate exploration of the moral histories of his fictive characters, the Mid-Victorian novelist could keep his eye upon the self and still expect to be intelligible to a fairly large public. To this extent, at least, the "private" voice expressive of what Clough called "an al- most animal sensibility of conscience" became the new "public" voice, even Dickens and Thackeray, who began with and to a certain extent retained an "amusement" theory of literature, moving in their later work towards the moral position taken by George Eliot and Matthew Arnold.65 By emphasizing the ethical relationships between man and man as they evolved within the context of bourgeois middle- and lower- class society, the Mid-Victorian moral premise provided the necessary condition for the remarkable development and the enormous popularity 53 See "The Ignorance of Man," The Works and Life of Walter Bagehot, ed.

Madden of a genre which Lionel Trilling has defined as "a perpetual quest for reality, the field of its research being always the social world, the mate- rial of its analysis being always manners as the indication of the direction of man's soul."56 The difference between Tennyson and the first-rate Mid-Victo- rian writers was that the exploration of subjectivity, of the "way of the soul," always involved for the latter what it had only sometimes involved for Tennyson: a deliberate rejection of the irrational, whether in the form of the mania from above or of the mania from below.57 Browning's oblique reference to Shelley, a poet whom he greatly admired, in an early letter to Elizabeth Barrett registered the change. Shelley had written, "Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,/ Stains the white radiance of eternity," while Browning could "only make men and women speak - give you truth broken into prismatic hues, and fear the pure white light, even if it is in me."58 Even if prismatic reflections were the best that man could get in his search for the pure light, such fragmen- tary apprehensions were not for Shelley, as they are for Browning, suffi- cient. Their sufficiency for Browning was related to his fear of the light, a fear which, like the technique of "dramatic monologue" which he perfected as a way of rendering "truth broken," was in turn related to the many Mid-Victorian variations on Carlyle's theme of Entsagen, what Arold called the refusal to try to solve the universe, and to the pluralistic culture in which the Mid-Victorian writer found himself. As elaborated in The Ring and the Book, Browning's technique of the dramatic monologue, as Henry James later remarked, anticipated the "point-of-view novel" (Langbaum, pp. 134-136); but unlike the latter form, Browning's poems assume the reader's sharing certain basic Mid- Victorian moral assumptions regarding all that lay beyond rational dis- cussion or moral benevolence.59 A contemporary critic noted, for exam- ple, that on the subject of death Browning's "evasion is uncompromising and absolute," citing another contemporary critic on the relationship between Browning's evasion and the prevailing Mid-Victorian modes of thought and feeling: The final inductive hazard [Browning] declines for himself; his readers may take it if they will.

Two facts thus carefully shrouded from full vision by elaborate illusion conspicuously round in our lives - the life-giving and life-destroying elements, Sex and Death.... on either side of us trudge the shadow of Death and the bacchanal Sex, and we mumble prayers against the one, while we scourge ourselves for leering at the other.60 Recent critics have drawn attention to the underlying insecurity in Browning's optimism; the effects of this insecurity are evident in the differences which separate Tennyson and Browning in their poetic treat- ment of the irrational.61 But even if the basic human instincts were as manageable as the Mid-Victorian writer consciously assumed, there remained on the outer fringes of Mid-Victorian awareness the haunting problem of how indi- vidual moral experience could be reconciled with the fact of an amoral universe and, more pressingly, with the evils of an immoral and, in some areas, brutalizing society. The solution most frequently appealed to was Education, but the fundamentally ambiguous relationship of the Mid-Victorian writer to his audience, and an important clue to the Mid-Victorian sensibility, is manifest both in the necessary "haze" by which George Eliot distanced her audience, and in the rubric "Mad- house Cells" by which Browning safeguarded his readers against a misreading of a poem like "Johannes Agricola in Meditation." The emergence of a particular "physiognomy" would have been fatal for George Eliot as a novelist because it might have been that of a Cherokee (or, more realistically, of one of Mayhew's London slum-dwellers) to whom the moral premise would be either meaningless or patronizing.62 Similarly, in a way for which his 1842 essay on Chatterton provided a paradigm,63 Browning felt compelled to state or imply moral explana- tions for irrational behavior; when such behavior, by virtue of the insight and empathy which enabled him to render it convincingly, was in danger of seeming to justify itself, Browning went out of his way to reassure his audience.

Madden falling away from former glory - we may think of FitzGerald or of the young Arnold - this shadow on the fringe of experience became intru- sive: the eye was not on the self as a moral Everyman, but on an iso- lated 'I" which felt itself alienated from a corrupt society as well as from a morally neutral universe. Consciousness of this alienated "I" ac- counts for the new "private" voice expressed by Dickens, Arnold, Clough, FitzGerald, and Meredith, the tenor of which indicates that the ambivalence already present in the Early Victorian sensibility had sharpened dangerously. The gap between the private, secure world of sympathetic moral feeling and a morally indifferent society is perfectly though perhaps still unconsciously defined in Dickens' creation, in Bleak House, of two distinct narrative lines which run parallel without impinging on one another.64 Different in many ways from Dickens, as well as from one another, Arnold and Meredith express in Empedocles on Etna (1852) and Ballads and Poems of Tragic Life (1887) respec- tively sensibilities that have something basic in common. Arnold juxta- poses in one long poem types which are presented separately by Mere- dith in the three shorter poems published side by side at the end of his volume; Arnold's Empedocles (Byronic rebel-hero-exile), Pausanias (Stoic moralist), and Callicles (detached poet contemplating tragedy) find their equivalents in Meredith's Periander, Solon, and Bellerephon.65 In what might be described as triptyches of the Mid-Victorian sensi- bility, each poet locates the counterpart of George Eliot's moral vision in the central panel, with alternative visions of fear and guilt and of aesthetic detachment on either side, at the edges of awareness. Paus- anias and Solon, like Dickens' Esther in Bleak House, embody their authors' considered moral positions, but it is significant that Esther is ineffective, that Pausanias has adopted a position which the poem iden- tifies as second-best, and that Meredith ends his volume of poems not with "Solon," which has been described as "a public poem," a "poem of the will" creditable to the author but "not nearly so moving or beau- tiful as its partners," but with "Bellerephon," with its tragic theme of "the isolation of experience, oblivion annulling heroic achievement, the failure of contact between the hero and the crowd, and between the survivors of one generation and their successors" (Tompkins, p. 295). 64 See G. Armour Craig's analysis of Bleak House and Jane Eyre, "The Unpoetic Com- promise: On the Relation between Private Vision and Social Order in Nineteenth-cen- tury English Fiction," in Society and Self in the Novel, ed.

Arnold's poem, like his career as a whole, reveals the peculiar pressures which underlay the moral sen- sibility of the Mid-Victorian generation. Unable to recover the "organic" Wordsworthian structure of feeling which he admired, and rejecting Tennyson out of hand, Arnold found his own poetic instinct increas- ingly frustrated and threatening to destroy him; his poetry records the effects of these experiences in a painful movement from youthful nos- talgia for the "freshness" of the earlier Wordsworthian world, through the "moder" dialogue of the mind with itself which ends in death, to the final poems of morality which anticipate the ethical theory of liter- ature announced in his criticism. In this record Empedocles on Etna was the decisive document, for behind the confident manner of Arnold the moralist there was the defeat of Arnold the poet, whose deep-rooted revulsion from a Philistine society had originally inspired the creation of Empedocles. More even than Browning, perhaps, Arnold feared the "demonic" element,68 and the "private" voice of the young post- Romantic poet was gradually drowned in the "public" voice of the classicist critic.69 6 Walter Pater, Selected Works, ed.

As a result, his ambiguous "moral aesthetic" expresses both voices of Mid- Victorian literature, his "public" voice repeatedly asserting the moral and social effi- cacy of men's observing nature, while his "private" voice insisted on the autonomy of organic form and its irrelevance to moral concerns. Ruskin finally fell victim to the struggle within him. Among younger writers the tendency of his enormous influence was to suggest the possibility of following organic beauty either into aestheticism or into darker haunts of the imagination unfrequented by most Mid-Victorian writers.

About this time "Victorianism was dying, and a new frame of mind was emerging, a late Victorian frame of mind, which pointed forward to the postwar temper of the 1920's."'7 The variety and confusion of the new tendencies was such that recent studies have been content to apply relatively noncommittal labels to the period. The period may be described as Late Victorian, however, to the extent that the structure of feeling and the values projected by the Mid-Victorian moral sensibility remained active agents, however much qualified, in the formation of the new sensibility that was emerg- ing. One element of continuity was the carrying on of the "search for reality" which had begun with the Romantics and which the Realism and Impressionism of the last decades of the century represented in a latter-day version.71 And, there persisted a middle-class view of society, even in writers like Gissing and "B. V." Thomson, whose despair was in part related to their incapacity to conceive an alternative. Yet the creative sensibility of the final three decades of the cen- tury had moved beyond the Mid-Victorians, even beyond those still alive in 1890, who, like Ruskin and Meredith, were "finding ever wider fields of acceptance" (Jackson, p. 36). Late Victorian Realism and Im- pressionism, like the more original Symbolist technique of the period, were genuinely new modes of expression produced by the shift in basic modes of thinking and feeling. For the generation of writers who came after Arnold, George Eliot, and Ruskin, the disappearance of the haze provided by the moral premise was an inescapable fact of existence, and this disappearance proved fatal to the Mid-Victorian "public" voice as well as to the momentary equipoise which it had expressed. The major element of discontinuity derived not from a change in the nature of the search but from the peculiar reorientation of the searchers: "the human mind [fell] back upon individual preference as the surest guide to the fine arts and the bigger and more difficult art of life" (Jackson, p. 276). The retreat into individual preference and the private consciousness originated partly in a general reaction among sensitive people away from what seemed the endemic brutality and 70 Houghton, p. xv.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 90</page><page sequence="25">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY ugliness of industrial society, and partly in the wave of skepticism which broke over England in the 'seventies.72 This skepticism was a more comprehensive affair than either Early Victorian doubt or Mid- Victorian agnosticism, so much so as to be something different in kind rather than in degree. The central Mid-Victorian premises regarding the inevitability of a bourgeois class-structured society and the legiti- macy of the public and private morality that had become closely iden- tified with that society were called into question. The result was a serious breakdown in the established lines of communication, and to a certain extent even in the attempt to communicate, between the more important writers of the new generation and the Late Victorian public at large. For some writers attention shifted to the panel of isolation, fear, and guilt, releasing a destructive impulse that either turned in- ward and became suicidal or turned outward in destructively "realistic" portraits of society. In others, attention shifted to the ordered realm of aesthetic detachment as the only available mode of integration. The tendency to fall back upon personal preferences had been evident earlier. Rossetti's pursuit of ideal beauty was related to an un- certainty which he objectified at the outset of his career in three son- nets collectively titled "The Choice." "With impartial justice," C. M. Bowra remarks, "he speaks in turn with the voices of the voluptuary, the religious ascetic, and the inquiring thinker. He comes to no explicit conclusion and makes no declared choice between the three lives."73 Rossetti's choice was revealed not in the poetry but in an autobiograph- ical prose story called "Hand and Soul" which appeared in The Germ in 1850. This story was a tentative but symptomatic piece of self-analy- sis that moved towards the hypostasis of the writer's impressions, to- wards a state of mind in which the writer was inclined "to have no master save his mood," as Byron had said.74 As a record of sensibility, however, "Hand and Soul," like Pre-Raphaelitism generally, was am- biguous. An echo of the Carlylean gospel of work was still discernible: "What [God] hath set in thine heart to do, that do thou; and even if thou do it without thought of him, it shall be well done; it is this sacri- fice that he asketh of thee, and his flame is upon it for a sign" (Hough, p. 52). The faint "Celtic" note of the final phrase anticipates the prose of Pater and the young Yeats, but the Biblical idiom might still evoke a Victorian sense of religious duty. It is as a record of Rossetti's choice of 72 See H. G. Wood, Belief and Unbelief Since 1850 (Cambridge, 1955), pp. lo2ff.; Noel Annan, Leslie Stephen (Cambridge, Mass., 1952), pp. 160-161. 73 "The House of Life," in Wright, Victorian Literature, p. 263. 74 See Graham Hough, The Last Romantics (New York, 1961), pp. 50-53.

Madden "work" and of the re-direction of attention which this new work required that "Hand and Soul" may be considered both radical and prophetic: "Chiaro, servant of God, take now thine art unto thee, and paint me [the soul] thus, as I am, to know me: weak, as I am, and in the weeds of this time ... so shall thy soul stand before thee always and perplex thee no more" (Hough, p. 53). The "search for reality" inaugurated by the Romantics, subsequently given a moral function by the great Mid- Victorians, was now to be carried on, Rossetti's story suggests, without regard to social interests and without prior metaphysical or religious commitments: the objectifying of the inner consciousness of the "soul" was sufficient to itself. The attainment of peace by an aesthetic dis- tancing of experience is implicit even in Gissing, whose despair even- tually brought an end to his early flirtation with working-class socialism and led him back into himself and to a private imaginative world of "Greek" beauty and wholeness. Probably the most influential, as he was certainly the most artic- ulate, defender of aestheticism in the 'seventies was Pater, who by edu- cation and circumstances was better situated than either the impover- ished Gissing or an exotic "foreigner" like Rossetti to give expression to the new "private" voice of the Late Victorian decades in terms which educated English readers could assimilate. The sources of Pater's doc- trine and the relation of that doctrine to developments in other areas of contemporary experience reveal the direction in which the Victorian sensibility was moving in its final phase. He studied the Greeks, Heraclitus, and Epicurus, and was attracted by the former's doctrine of fire and flux and the latter's atomism and reduction of the mind-content to sensations and their products. In modern molecular theory he found a parallel to the Epicurean "declination of the atom," while "sensationalism" recurred in Hume's contention that within the mind is merely a stream of events, impressions, and their weaker traces, the ideas. Maybe Pater had also read Herbart's theory of conscious- ness which described the perpetual ebb and flow of presentations.75 Combining the principle of relativity in intellectual matters with the law of fidelity to one's impressions in aesthetics, Pater celebrated the qualities of intensity and openness in the aesthetic experience in a way that implied the irrelevance of other modes of experience, thereby ad- vancing a movement toward specialization which was reflected in the increasing "literariness" of the leading periodicals of the day. 75 Geoffrey Bullough, "Changing Views of the Mind in English Poetry," Proceedings of the British Academy, XLI (1955), 8o.

VICTORIAN STUDIES 92</page><page sequence="27">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY Although there were other contributing pressures, the kind of thoroughgoing skepticism which Pater recommended very early in his career was probably responsible for driving the younger writers back in on themselves, either out of curiosity or more often out of disillusion or despair, in search of a new way to organize the multitudinousness and to distance the ugliness of late nineteenth-century civilization. W. H. Auden has pointed out that Lewis Carroll's "The Hunting of the Snark" opened a room in the psyche which the Victorians had kept firmly shut: "The snark, that is, the meaning of existence, turns out to be a Boojum - existence is meaningless."76 What Carroll had concealed behind the disguise of a "nonsense" poem, Pater was discreetly and plausibly attempting to compensate for in his literary criticism, by cen- tering attention on the immediate personal impression, and by recom- mending the private consciousness rather than society as the proper arena for enjoying the fruits of the new ascesis. Environment - the past, nature, society, philosophy, personal relationships -merited interest only to the extent that it promised to contribute to the intensity of that inner experience of excitement-amidst-order which Coleridge had asso- ciated with art. Could he but arrest, for others also, certain clauses of experience, as the imaginative memory presented them to himself! . .. To create, to live, perhaps, a little beyond the allotted hours, if it were but in a fragment of perfect expression: - it was thus his longing defined itself for something to hold by amid the "perpetual flux." With men of his vocation, people were apt to say, words were things. Well! - with him, words should be indeed things, - the word, the phrase, valuable in exact proportion to the transparency with which it conveyed to others the apprehension, the mood, so vividly real within himself.77 Pater was cautious by nature, and the unforeseen consequences of the kind of "aesthetic education" which he proposed, dramatized in the tragic lives of some of his younger adherents, shocked him into a shift of emphasis in his later work which was in fact a return to "that old religious sense of responsibility, the conscience, as we call it" (Marius, p. 117) which makes Marius the Epicurean a genuinely Late Victorian rather than a "Decadent" or Moder work. But in advocating the aes- thetic mode as the best means available for organizing experience into some kind of coherence, Pater not only represented the Victorian sen- sibility in its final phase but, by the logic if not by the intention of his prose, suggested new possibilities of experience, mystical or demonic. 76 Poets of the English Language, ed.

Madden In terms of the two voices whose history we have been tracing, the Late Victorian sensibility may be described as completely "private" in that the eye of the writer is primarily on the isolated self, even when, as in Gissing, it is attacking society as hopelessly Philistine. There was no longer a "public" voice in the Mid-Victorian sense, but rather an "anti-public" voice which was simply one way for the artist to express the felt isolation which is the burden of the "private" voice of Late Victorian feeling. Disclosing a self searching for order and emotion in the implicativeness of language, attaining in Rossetti and Morris what Pater approvingly called the emotion of emotion, the new sensibility was rendered in an idiom which made poetry and prose alike attenu- ated, artificial, remote. "Victorian" enough to hesitate, Pater wavered between an "impersonal" impressionism that isolated feeling from moral considerations as the sensitive consciousness of the artist contemplated the flux of atomistic moments of experience, and a personal ethic, Vic- torian in its bias, which attempted to endow the flux with moral signifi- cance. But when Marius asked himself whether the hypothesis of "an eternal friend to man, just hidden behind the veil" might not really be "dependent on some deliberate act of volition on his part," and whether the will itself might not thus become an "organ of knowledge, of vision" (Marius, p. 232), the energy needed to make the required act of will was unavailable, and Marius dies without an answer to his question. The Victorian impulse to doubt had finally paralyzed the Vic- torian will to believe. Compared to Pater's, William Morris's was a less representative, more prophetic response to the Late Victorian impasse, since in his life and writings the Early and Mid-Victorian ambiguity became a con- scious split which required radical treatment. In his early years Morris's aestheticism, like Pater's, had led him away from society as from some- thing alien and unassimilable, an affront to his aesthetic conscience which compelled flight into Ruskin's and Scott's medieval past. Twenty- three and fresh from Oxford, he wrote to a friend in 1856, "I can't enter into politico-social subjects with any interest, for on the whole I see that things are in a muddle, and I have no power or vocation to set them right in ever so little a degree. My work is the embodiment of dreams in one form or another."78 Carried to an extreme, this type of aestheti- cism resulted in the self-destructive lives of Thomson, Johnson, Dow- son, and Wilde. The significance of Morris's career is that this destruc- 78 J. W. Mackail, The Life of William Morris, intro. Sir Sidney Cockerell (London, 1950), I, 109. VICTORIAN STUDIES 94</page><page sequence="29">THE VICTORIAN SENSIBILITY tive impulse eventually turned outward, expressing itself in political action designed to destroy the society which was thus fatally corrupting men's lives. In the 'seventies Morris abandoned his "idle singing," dis- missing an abortive novel on which he was at work as "nothing but landscape and sentiment" (Mackail, I, 296), and became increasingly preoccupied in imagination with the Icelandic Sagas and, in politics, with revolutionary socialism. The relation between his aesthetic interests, his political activity, his love of Icelandic literature, and his reorientation of the destructive impulse is suggested by an account of the northern mythology which Morris composed in the 1870's: It may be that the world shall worsen, that men shall grow afraid to "change their life," that the world shall be weary itself, and sicken, and none but faint-hearts be left - who knows? So at any rate comes the end at last, and the Evil, bound for a while, is loose, and all nameless merciless horrors that on earth we figure by fire and earthquake and venom and ravin. So comes the great strife; and like the kings and heroes that they have loved, here also must the Gods die, the Gods who made that strifeful imperfect earth, not blindly indeed, yet foredoomed. One by one they ex- tinguish for ever some dread and misery that all this time has brooded over life, and one by one, their work accomplished, they die: till at last the great destruction breaks out over all things, and the old earth and heavens are gone, and then a new heaven and earth. What goes on there? Who shall say, of us who know only of rest and peace by toil and strife? And what shall be our share in it? Well, sometimes we must needs think that we shall live again: yet if that were not, would it not be enough that we helped to make this unnameable glory, and lived not altogether deedless? (Mackail, II, 343-344) His biographer observes that these views were substantially those of Morris himself. What, ideally, should come after the great battle Morris attempted to describe for his readers in The Dream of John Ball and News from Nowhere, lyric word-paintings of aesthetic utopias from which politics, in the usual sense, are completely absent. Although his concern for a "constructive" revolution, his Ruskinian love of the Gothic, and his Carlyle-like admiration for heroic deeds betray his early educa- tion, in his growing recognition of the possibility and, in certain moods, the desirability of violence, Morris was closer to Yeats than to his prede- cessors. Despite a professed hatred of war, in early 1870 he was disap- pointed when the newspaper rumors of a European conflict proved unfounded; his mood was not unlike that of Yeats when the latter re- marked, with relative equanimity, "After Mallarme, Verlaine, and us - the Savage God." The Late Victorian sensibility embodied in the alternative possi- bilities conceived by Pater and Morris reflected an impasse which had resulted from the failure of the Mid-Victorian attempt to control the irrational by force of will. Ruskin's madness was indicative of the reality SEPTEMBER 1963 95</page><page sequence="30">William A. Madden of one kind of mania; Hopkins' acceptance, I did say yes O at lightning and lashed rod; Thou heardst me truer than tongue confess Thy terror, 0 Christ, 0 God,79 was a re-discovery of the possibility of another. For the Mid-Victorians neither alternative had been desirable, but with the collapse of the Mid- Victorian moral premise the Late Victorians found themselves much more aware of and more vulnerable to both. Their response was inevit- ably one of confusion. The destructive element which Pater had anach- ronistically found in Wordsworth, which Arnold had suppressed after embodying it in his Empedocles, and which Morris found attractive in Norse mythology, was finally incorporated by Yeats into the sensibility which found expression in his mature writings: THE SYRIAN. What if at the moment when knowledge and order seem com- plete that something happens? [He has begun to laugh.] THE HEBREW. Stop laughing. THE SYRIAN. What if the irrational return? What if the circle begin again? THE HEBREW. Stop! He laughed when he saw Calvary through the window, and now you laugh. THE GREEK. He too has lost control of himself. THE HEBREW. Stop, I tell you. [Drums and rattles.] THE SYRIAN. But I am not laughing. It is the people out there who are laugh- ing.8o The nature of the Modem sensibility as represented by Yeats's mature poetry has already been discussed, but it may be permissible, in con- cluding, to suggest that Rossetti, Pater, and Morris, in their different contributions, help to explain the difference in sensibility which sep- arates Yeats and Joyce81 from Browning and George Eliot. The disso- lution and the creation, through art, of the world in which man must live had become for the modern writer of the early twentieth century not the fantasy of a brain-sick fanatic, but a condition of life. Yeats's mature poetry celebrates the imaginative mastery over the demonic as well as the human exercised by the poet in the aesthetic artifice, fixing 79 Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed. W. H.

Certainly they no longer make a fuss about being infidels. And they are suspected of belief for another reason, too. Almost to a man, Edwardian writers rejected Christianity, and having done so, they felt free to use it, for while they did not need religion they did need religious metaphors" (p. 192).

As Arnold had predicted, with the final disappearance of a common religious frame of reference, poetry became religious and art the forgiveness of sin. In attempting to trace the evolution of the Victorian sensibility I have been concerned to avoid the foreshortening against which mod- em scholarship has warned us, at the same time trying to suggest a way of bringing order into a body of literature that is notoriously complex and voluminous. The argument, in summary, has been that the "public" voice of Early Victorian literature reflected a conscious effort to tran- scend the doubt which by 1830 had fatally touched the fundamental Romantic faith, while the self-consciousness of this effort found expres- sion in the "private" voice which qualified the work of the best writers; that in the 'fifties and 'sixties a new "public" voice emerged reflecting the shift of value and feeling away from comprehensive Romantic com- mitments towards a moral premise which represented a diminished ver- sion of those commitments, the desolation of the "private" voice mean- while intensifying in those writers who could neither accept the moral premise nor find a viable alternative; that in Late Victorian literature, with the collapse of the Mid-Victorian moral premise, the "public" voice disappeared and the "private" voice - pessimistic, subjective, relativist, and detached - emerged as the dominant voice. In terms of the writer- audience relationship, it has been suggested that Early Victorian doubt and hope made communication seem still possible and important; that Mid-Victorian agnosticism, by limiting the possibilities, established a momentary harmony; and that Late Victorian skepticism, by question- ing the Mid-Victorian premise, finally isolated the writer from his fragmented audience. In thus concentrating on the slowly changing relationship between the "public" and the "private" voices in Victorian literature as this relationship reflected some of the more important psychological and environmental changes which helped to shape the Victorian sensibility, it has been possible to do little more than suggest the kind of evidence that would be required in detail to adequately sup- port such broad generalizations. Perhaps enough has been said, however, to indicate the possible usefulness of studying the Victorian sensibility in greater detail, and in fields other than literature.
