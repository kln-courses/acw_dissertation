<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 The chief focus of archaeological interest in Greece during 1975-76 concentrated on vexatious problems of conservation-conservation of indivi- dual sites and monuments threatened by irrever- sible damage caused by the pollution of the atmo- sphere, of which the Acropolis of Athens is the most alarming instance; conservation of an entire region whose importance is an amalgm of the beauty of the landscape, the evocative nature of its historical associations, and the importance of the visible remains of its past, of which Pylos and the Bay of Navarino have been the most emotive; con- servation of the recent past, of which the fast- disappearing neo-classical buildings have claimed much attention. The problems are formidable in a country with a matchless heritage from the past, yet rightly anxious to develop its resources to the utmost for the benefit of its people. The situation, of course, requires sympathetic understanding from outside; it has to have more-practical sup- port, instead of moralizing; the offer of resources and technical skills at need. Most important of all, perhaps, is a willingness on all sides to compro- mise between the urge that everything from the past must at all costs be preserved, and a deter- mination that nothing must be allowed to stand in the way of modernisation. Greek archaeologists maintained a full programme of field activities during the period under review. Though their energies were constantly in demand to meet the challenge of increasing building and development, their customary level of planned re- search excavation continued. Among notable dis- coveries reported, pride of place should go to the important and rich finds from the Minoan cemetery at Arkhanes. Also of great importance is the Boeotian cemetery of the seventh to the fourth century B.C. at Akraiphnon, whose contents pro- mise to be more diverse and important than the Rhitsona cemetery. Shortly after AR 1974-75 went to press, with its news of the deaths of Professors Marinatos and Kondoleon, came the sad report of the death, very soon after his retirement, of Mr Ioannis Kondis, Inspector-General of the Archaeological Service until summer, 1975. Mr Kondis' place has been taken by Mr D. Lazarides, well known, inter alia, for his important work at Amphipolis. A number of Greek publications have come to hand during the period under review. Of the Archaeo- logikon Deltion (ADelt), the second part of the Chronika (Chron) for volume 26 has been publish- ed, covering excavations, accidental discoveries and restoration work in certain parts of Greece during 1970. One volume of ADelt 28 (1973), the Meletai (Mel) has also appeared. After some un- certainty about its future, publication of Athens Annals of Archaeology (AAA) has continued; VIII, pt. 1,for 1975 has so far been published. The Archaeological Society (Archaeologiki Etairia) continued its series of periodical literature; Archaeologiki Ephemeris (AE) for 1974 was issued, together with the Society's Praktika for 1973, and its Ergon for 1975. (The reader will recall that the Praktika for a given year deals largely with the same material that has been summarised in the Ergon of that year). The Archaeological Society also published further volumes in its series of monographs-volumes 1 and 2 of Professor G. Mylonas' To Dytikon Nekrotapheion tes Eleusinas (No. 81), the publication of the plate volume for which was reported in these pages last year. Also published are:- Mrs J. Vokotopoulou's Halkai Corinthiourgeis Prohi (No. 82), the joint volume of N. Platon and W. C. Brice Enepigraphi pinakides kai pithi Grammikou systematos A ek Zakrou (No. 85) and A. Zoes: Vasiliki I (No. 83). The Archaeological Service published Miss A. Lembessis' monograph I Steles tou Prinia. Pro- fessor Sp. Marinatos' (posthumous) seventh interim report on his excavations at Thera (Thera VII) was issued by the Archaeological Society. Publications by regional learned societies of interest to readers of AR include Lakonikai Spoudai (Society for Laconian Studies), Archeion Evboikon Meleton 20 (Society for Euboean Studies),Kretika Chronika 26 (Society for Cretan Historical Studies) and Makedonika 14 (Society for Macedonian Studies). The Historical and Archaeological Society of Western Crete published A. A. Zoes and others, Anaskaphi Vryson Kydonias 1. The basis of this report so far as it is concerned with the results of Greek excavations is the pub- lished periodical literature referred to above. I am indebted once more both to the Archaeological Service and the Archaeological Society for this information and for their generosity in lending many of the illustrations reproduced here. The Directors of the other foreign schools and missions in Greece and the leaders of the excava- tions carried out in their name with unfailing kind- ness again provided information and photographs with permission to publish them in these Reports. I am deeply indebted to them, and to my colleagues in the British School, especially to Helen Efthymiades. ATHENS AND ATTICA Museums and Collections. The special exhibition of Cypriot antiquities referred to in AR 1974-75 3 has remained on display in the National Museum. Mrs A. Datsoulis-Stavrides has identified the marble head NM 437 (Fig. 1) as a portrait of Julius Caesar, comparing it with a portrait now in Turin (ADelt 28 Mel 243-5).</page><page sequence="2">4 H. W. CATLING Fig. 2 Fig. 1 The P. Kanellopoulos Collection (presented to the Greek State in 1972) is now permanently housed in the Plaka (corner of Theorias and Panos Streets) and has been formally opened to the public. It is in the care of the Ephorate of the Acropolis. Miss A. Andreiomenou has published a number of vases (chiefly Attic bf and rf) newly brought to Greece by the antiquities' dealer A. Rousos. She has also published eight archaic and classical vases in the M. Goulandris Collection, including a bf neck amphora attributed to the Painter of Vatican 309 (AAA VIII [1975] 104-117). City Area: West of Areopagos. Considerable interest attaches to the identification proposed by E. Vanderpool, and widely reported in the Press, of the so-called 'Poros Building' as the public prison in which, in 399 B.C., Socrates passed the last days of his life. The building, excavated some years ago by the American School, lies close west of the Areopagos and beyond the south-west corner of the Agora, and was described in detail in Hesperia 20 (1951), 135 ff., especially 168-87. (Kathemerini 1. 2. 76; To Vima 13. 6. 76). Acropolis. A very fully illustrated posthumous publication by S. Charitonides of the PG and G graves and other contemporary finds (Figs. 2, 3) from the excavations of 1955-1959 south of the Acropolis has appeared inADelt 28 (1973) Mel 1-63. Fig. 3 Walls. The Greek Press reports the accidental discovery of a section of the southern circuit of the City Wall at the junction of Veikou and Misaroliotou streets (between, that is, the South Gate and the presumed position of the Halade Gate). The structures uncovered belonged to the late fifth century B.C.,but showed signs of re- arrangement and repairs in the fourth century B.C. and later (Kathemerini 23. 6. 76). Cemeteries. Mrs P. Kapetanaki-Leonardou has published an Attic bf amphora of Type B, attributing</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 5 it to the Affecter (cover picture), found in 1967 in the Archaic cemetery north of the Hill of the Nymphs, between the Demian and Peiraic Gates (ADelt 28 Mel 215-221). Rhamnous. V. Petrakos (AS) in 1975 started the first excavations to be undertaken at this site since 1892. He investigated a number of classical grave monuments in the vicinity of the Sacred Way. One, datable to the last half of the fifth cen- tury B.C., is a circular marble-built structure more than 5 50 m. in diameter. With it was found a statuette of Hekate, and a large marble base for marble funeral vases, probably a loutrophoros between two lekythoi. A second monument was the family sepulchre of a certain Euphranor, whose funerary inscription claimed he was 105 at his death. The names of six of his relatives appear on the stela, datable to ca. 340 B.C. The first tomb on the north side of the Sacred Way is that of Diageiton and his family, datable in the second half of the fourth century B.C. Work was undertaken on two other funeral monuments in the same vicinity (Ergon 1975, 7-11). EUBOEA In Arch. Eub. Mel. 20 (1975), 479-541 is a supple- mentary bibliography of Euboean studies from 1900-1974. In AE 1974, Chron 5-15, A. Sampson has published notes on his recent topographical study of pre- historic sites in Euboea, with particular emphasis on Neolithic finds. In addition to supplementary observations on the following sites previously reported by L. H. Sackett and others, BSA 61 (1966) 33-110, nos. 3,14, 18a, 20, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35 and 84, he records surface indications (pottery, obsidian, stone tools) at several previously un- recorded locations, including Kerinthos in N. Euboea, Psakhna, Triada, Makrikapa, Theologos, Phylla, Nea Artaki, Chalcis in Central Euboea, and at Dystos in the east. Th. Skouras has published a fully illustrated and documented descriptive catalogue of over 100 fortifications and towers remaining in the island, the majority of which are Mediaeval, or earlier buildings reused in the Middle Ages (Arch. Eub. Mel. 20 [1975] 327-400). Chalcis. N. Papadakis has reported the excavation of a 28 m. stretch of the Mediaeval city wall, exposed by building operations in Mardohaiou Frizi street. He suggests that the construction of this part of the wall should be datable to the ninth cen- tury A.D. or earlier. He makes a very useful collection of the testimonia concerning the wall (Arch. Eub. Mel. 20 [1975] 277-318). Chalcis: Museum. Miss A. Andreiomenou has published a number of Attic and Boeotian bf and rf vases, as well as several Boeotian terracottas formerly in the A. Oikonomos Collection, now in Chalcis Museum (AE 1974, 224-43). Eretria. P. Themelis (AS) has described his 1974 excavation within Square 740 of the city area (see also AR 1974-75 4-5). Building remains discover- ed include part of a stoa datable to the late second or early third century A.D., part of which may have been used as shops. Confirmation of the relative importance of Eretria at this date is provided by coins struck by the city during the reign of Com- modus, on the reverse of which is what appears to be a personification of Eretria. Below the Roman stoa traces of buildings of the first half of the second century B.C. were found, parts at least of which seem to have remained in use until the end of the first century B.C. Above the Roman stoa were found the remains of a pottery factory the destruction of which is probably to be asso- ciated with the earthquake of A.D. 365, followed by the abandonment of the city site. The site was subsequently used as the cemetery for some poor village in the immediate vicinity. Eretria Museum. Finds made in the excavations of 1886-1895, from Middle Helladic material on- wards, have been transferred from the National Museum. Of particular note is an Attic wg lek- ythos, youth at the tomb (Ergon 1975, 26-36). Kerinthos. A. Sampson reports trial excavations in 1974 at the prehistoric settlement of Ayios Elias (Euboea Survey site 14, BSA 61, 44). Middle Helladic levels and a burial without grave goods were found. Sampson also made trials at the large prehistoric and post-Bronze Age settlement site of Kria Vrisi (Euboea Survey site 13,BSA 61, 43-4). Several traces of buildings, some perhaps datable to the fourth century B.C., were found. Pottery recovered included possible Early Helladic material as well as much PG, Geometric, Orient- alizing and classical fabrics. Notable is a late fifth century B.C. Attic rf pyxis lid showing women busy in the house (AAA VIII [1975] 28-37). CORINTHIA AND ARGOLIS Corinth. Mr Charles Williams II has described the work of the American School in 1975, during its spring programme of excavation. He writes: 'Excavation at Ancient Corinth was a continuation of the activities in the Roman forum conducted in 1974. The area involved lies north of the north- west corner of the South Stoa and west of the line of re-set archaic columns that goes north from that corner of the stoa. Excavation probed as far north and west of the north-west corner of the stoa as to include the south tower of the Roman West Shops. 'This year the major efforts were expended in strata datable to between the fifth century A.C. and the fifth century B.C.</page><page sequence="4">6 H. W. CATLING I 11 Fig. 4 Fig. 5 'All pre-Roman levels uncovered and excavated during the 1975 season are within a fifteen by twenty metre area that includes the south tower of the Roman West Shops and the areas adjacent to the south and east sides. Excavation within the south tower descended to levels that contained al- most exclusively pottery of the prehistoric period and from MG II into LG. One disturbed grave, probably Geometric, is to be associated with these strata. 'Well 75-3, abandoned and filled at the beginning of the LG period (Fig. 4), is the earliest datable arch- itectural remain thus far found and excavated here. The top of the well shaft lies under the east wall of the south tower of the West Shops. East of the well a trench was excavated from the founda- tions of the tower of the West Shops eastward for 8 metres. In it was found a shallow, rectangular pit; its original function is that of a refuse pit for a large amount of broken coarseware, most of which is transport amphorae. Among these was discarded an assortment of Corinthian and Attic fine wares; the more complete examples of fine wares range in date before and the decade after 450 B.C. Two largely complete Punic amphorae and at least one other, very fragmentary, were re- covered from the fill. These are the first of their type thus far recognized in excavation at Corinth. 'The earliest structure with a comprehensible plan is a pentagonal building. It is almost totally con- tained within the limits of the south tower of the Roman West Shops; it was constructed within the third quarter of the fifth century. 'A bath lies south of the pentagonal building and forms the southern side of an 0'90 m.wide pas- sage. Three rooms only have been uncovered, none of which have been completely excavated. The north-eastern room has a cement floor and reservoir. The north-western one has a furnace and, in all probability, is an open work area around the furnace. The third room, south of these two, is paved with a pebble mosaic and probably is the bathing room. 'The north-east room appears to have supplied the bath water used in the building. Water would have been dispersed from its cistern to be heated at the furnace in the room or court to its west. The cistern also may have supplied water directly to the bathing room with mosaic floor. 'Immediately west of the reservoir room lies a space that contains a large furnace. The floor and lower walls of the fire-box are preserved in the south-east corner of this space. The furnace is built against the north wall of the room with mosaic floor and it shares its east wall with the west wall of the cistern room. 'The third room of the Centaur Bath is the bathing room. The floor is decorated (Fig. 5) with a central square of black and white pebbles in cement. Wide cement borders without pebble mosaic are pre- served on its east and west sides. The central panel is decorated with a four-spoked wheel with hub at its centre. Spaces between spokes are Fig. 6</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 7 alternately black and white. Around the wheel run concentric bands, the first decorated with black and white triangles, the second with a maeander, the outermost with a wave pattern. 'Filling figures apparently decorated all four corners of the square panel, of which only the north-east and north-west corners are now visible. The north-west corner is occupied by an ithyphallic donkey. In the north-east corner is a centaur (Fig. 6) running to the right reaching towards a small spotted feline, perhaps a leopard, that runs away from him. 'North-west of the bath a well-like pit was dug into the road and into the poros bedrock after 350 B.C. The large bulk of pottery from the pit is augmented by a large number of miniatures in a large number of shapes. Many are miniatures of functional forms, such as Corinthian type A amphorae; these are rarely found as votives. Some are common household forms, such as the oinochoai, craters, and kotylai, reduced in scale, probably to serve as votives. 'Because of the probability that the pit was dug to be used specifically as a dumping place for this pottery and because of the religious associations coupled with some of the objects, one is tempted to consider this deposit a favissa, dug and filled after extensive damage to some surrounding sanctuary or shrine. 'Much debris of the third quarter of the fourth century was found still overlying the bath, even though the wall orthostates had long been re- moved for use elsewhere. The mud-brick collapse from furnace and upper walls, however, remains undisturbed over most of the building and firing chamber, with the exception of the area at the centre of the pebble mosaic floor, where the debris was removed to within 0-20 m. of the mosaic for the construction of a late sixth century A.C. double tomb with vaulted chambers. Remains of the Roman Period 'Grid Squares 71 B and C and 72 B and C were cleared during the 1974 spring excavation in the south-west forum. Here lies the intersection be- tween a north-south and east-west road. The east-west road enters the forum through the colonnade of archaic columns north of the north- west corner of the South Stoa. A large early Roman building with basement fronts on the south- west corner of the intersection of the two roads. The north-west corner of the intersection is formed by the south tower of the West Shops. This year the east side of the intersection was cleared. The Roman history of the intersection now proves to be more complex than excavation in 1974 had suggested. The south-east corner of the intersection is occupied by an Early Roman building that goes through three definite phases of occupation before the end of the first century A.C., with less well preserved evidence for alteration in the second century A.C., and, finally, a general revamping of the area in the last half of the fourth century A.C. 'The initial construction of the building at the south-east corner of the intersection apparently predates the intersection, for although its west wall is along the east side of the north-south road of the crossing, its north wall is 3 40 m. south of the intersection. When the road system is laid out, the north limit of the already existing building is extended northward by the necessary 3 40 m. 'The northward addition to the building iin phase two does not bond with the original fabric, nor are as many re-used blocks employed in the founda- tions; here foundations are of rectangular poros blocks. 'Phase three in the building is caused by the erec- tion of a long rectangular building of poros directly in front of the north fagade of the earlier Roman building. As a result of the new construction, the building on the south-east corner is again altered. Its north wall is rebuilt on the foundations that had served in phase two; now the wall is built in rubble and concrete, but without a doorway. A stairway is built from the street on the west side of the build- ing to replace the earlier entrance in the north facade. The erection of the new long rectangular building eliminates the intersection of streets and blocks that portion of the east-west road that had stretched from the intersection eastward to the colonnade of archaic columns. As a result, the colonnade north of the South Stoa no longer serves to mark the east end of that street, nor is it the entrance from the street into the south-west corner of the agora. 'The long rectangular building, almost completely excavated this year, is approximately 23-90 m.long and about 5-50 wide. It has no colonnade, rather all sides would probably have been walled. At the west end the interior face of the south wall re- ceived buttresses in the Byzantine period. In like manner buttresses were built along the inside edge of the north wall foundation. This implies that orthostates, or a wall of some sort, existed at the west end of the north foundation into the ninth or tenth centuries A.C., and that a repair of the west end of this long rectangular building was still possible at that time. 'The building apparently had two acanthus-column monuments erected north of the north facade. The find-places of the various acanthus fragments suggest that one column was probably erected near the west end of the building and the other near the east. The two monuments are identical, with base, two units of shaft, and capital, rising to a height of about 5-25 m. 'The foundations of the south wall of the long build- ing are constructed over a north-south drain. They</page><page sequence="6">8 H.W. CATLING are carried to the soft bedrock into which the earliest water channel had been cut. 'One might divide the three phases into general units of time, using the meagre material that is available; the first phase spans the later part of the first century B.C. The second includes most of the first half of the first century A.C., while the third, which includes the construction of the long rectangular building as well as the rebuilding of the northern addition to the building that up until then had occupied the south-east corner of the inter- section, starts in the third quarter of the first century A.C., probably within the reign of Nero. The building is destroyed or so badly damaged in the third quarter of the fourth century A.C. that one suspects its eastern end to have been aban- doned totally at this time. Because of the numis- matic evidence and the pottery from destruction fill and from the drain trench one can assume that the long rectangular building was badly shaken in the earthquake of A.D. 365 with the east end suffer- ing more intensely than the west end. 'By the tenth century A.C. earth floors and a hearth have covered the interior wall; shabby buttresses are added to the inside face of the south wall and against the still-existing orthostates or wall of the north side of the building. On the floors associated with the new occupation were found a coin of Romanus I, 919-944, and one with a Romanus over- strike. Little else of import can be said of the history of the long rectangular building. 'An arch with single portal was erected, apparently, at the same time as and immediately to the east of the long rectangular building. This served to mark the entrance into the forum from the south-west. The north fagade of the arch along with the fagade of the rectangular building makes a single, con- tinuous line for the south side of the enlarged forum, defining the limits between the South Stoa and the south tower of the West Shops. No strati- graphic evidence exists, however, that can prove the Neroniari construction date of the arch; late robbing has left no strata of the construction period undisturbed.' H. S. Robinson (Case Western Reserve University) continued his excavation on Temple Hill in 1975. He writes: 'Work was carried out in three areas: the Early Christian basilica, the Early Roman quarry, and the West Road Trenches. In the basilica the eastern part of the funerary chapel which lies alongside the south aisle was fully cleared (cf. AR 1974-75 8, fig. 10). A well-preserved ossuary of Early Christian date, reused in Byzantine times, lay adjacent to the south wall of the chapel; its rubble- concrete vault was broken, but enough survived to reconstruct the original curvature. The entrance shaft to the ossuary was preserved almost to the original floor level of the chapel; the doorway from the bottom of the shaft into the ossuary survived with its lintel in place. Within the chamber, in the layer of bones directly above the floor, was found a Byzantine bronze cup lying beside the skull of a primary interment. In the south aisle of the basilica additional shallow graves were uncovered; very few offerings were found with the bones. Re-examina- tion of the basilica revealed new evidence which makes it possible to revise our plan of the Early Christian structure-the changes involve primarily the width of the aisles as compared with that of the nave, for it is now clear that the column bases found at the south side of the nave were moved in Byzantine times; they now lie about 0 60 m. south of their original positions. 'In the Early Roman quarry we are now clearing that part of the cutting which extended southward along the east face of the hill. The fill in the quarry here is identical with that found in prior seasons further to the north and west: a mixture of the earth that the Romans had to clear away from the rock surface in order to expose the rock for quarrying, of debris from the sack by Mummius (much of which must have been lying on the hill- top when the Roman repairs of the archaic temple began), and of Roman sherds of the early first century after Christ. Interesting discoveries in the qVarry filling included a lead inscription in- cised boustrophedon in letters which are ca. 0-012 m.-0 014 m. high; parts of three lines of text are preserved, but only in the second and third are the letters identifiable. The letter forms are probably no later than 600 B.C. The text seems to constitute part of a list or calendar of sacri- fices; the inscription is, therefore, a public one, designed to be exposed: two holes in the tablet may be original nail-holes which served for fastening the document to a wall. Public inscrip- tions on lead are rare, but five have been reported from the Corinthian colony of Kerkyra since 1961. Also remarkable is a cylinder-seal; it has been split vertically and one half is missing. The design (Fig. 7) is divided horizontally into two zones, separated by a guilloche-like pattern of two twining serpents. The upper zone is marked by a striding sheep with recurved horns and a lion (?); in the lower zone a human figure (herdsman?) follows another sheep. Professor E.Porada has identified it as probably of Syrian origin and stylistically of the twenty-sixth century B.C. Such seals, Miss Porada reports, were often worn in later times as amulets. Ours may have reached Corinth as an amulet and there have been offered as a dedication in the Temple of Apollo. The time Fig. 7</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 9 Fig. 8 at which the seal might have come to Corinth is most likely to have been the eighth or seventh century B.C. 'When that portion of the quarry which lay immedi- ately south of the Early Christian basilica had been completely excavated, a plan and several cross-sections were prepared; the quarry was photographed and observations were made on the evidence for quarrying methods, block dimensions, etc. We removed from the south wall of the funerary chapel of the basilica (a wall whose foun- dations rested on the floor of the quarry) a Roman marble female torso built into the lowest course of the wall (Fig. 8). The damaged wall was then rebuilt; at the same time a completely modern retaining wall was built across the open eastern end of the quarry. It was our intention to refill the t~ ~ ~~1 *0 9 * quarry with the piles of nondescript fragments of limestone blocks of the two Apollo temples (all significant block fragments have been saved and catalogued). 'The West Road trenches (lying approximately due north of the west end of the archaic temple) pro- duced our most interesting finds. This part of the hill had been Turkish farm property in the eigh- teenth century. The retaining wall which marked the north boundary of the farm was pierced by three stairways (kalderimia); these gave access to the farm buildings from a Turkish road which lay just outside the retaining wall, almost parallel to the older Roman temenos wall. In late Byzantine times private houses lined the west side of a broad north-south roadway which led up the flank of the hill; to the east of the road were graves and ossuaries, presumably to be associated with the Byzantine church at the north-east corner of the hill (over the remains of the Early Christian basilica). Beneath the Byzantine graves and road were traces of Late Roman interments and a Late Roman road. But the most important discovery of all was a corresponding north-south road of the sixth century B.C., and a propylon which, from an opening in the sixth-century temenos wall, gave access to the road and provided a splendid oblique view of the north-west corner of the archaic temple (Fig. 9). The propylon is in large measure concealed by the westernmost Turkish staircase. None of the superstructure of the propylon has been identified; the foundations show clear evidence of two building periods.

CATLING through the propylon, rising southward towards the temple, must have joined the east-west road which ran along the north flank of the hill, from north- east to south-west. The latter road, constructed ca. 625 B.C., was for the most part abandoned and covered at the time of the building of the sixth- century temple and the enlargement of the temenos to the north; but the western portion of that road seems to have been kept open and in use. It be- came apparent this year that the east-west road, instead of continuing in the direction of the Foun- tain of Glauke (as we had supposed), curved toward the southwest at a point just beyond the west end of the archaic temple; the wheel-ruts in bedrock are clearly in evidence at the curve. There may, however, have been a secondary branch of the road leading towards Glauke. 'The excavation in the West Road Trenches brought to light also a well shaft lying just inside the line of the north temenos wall of the sixth century B.C. The well is of unusual size (d. 1'50 m.); it was kept in use through Byzantine and Turkish times; the date of its construction is not yet known. It seems quite possible that this was a major source of water-supply for the sanc- tuary in the classical period.' Mrs M. Krikou-Galani has published a hoard of more than 600 AE minimi (over 200 of which are identifiable) found in 1971 during trial excavations near ancient Corinth. The hoard was probably buried during the late sixth century A.D. (ADelt 28 Mel 138-58). Isthmia. It was reported in the Greek press that P. Clement has uncovered a particularly fine floor mosaic of the first century A.D. in his 1976 exca- vation season on the Roman bath building. Sea creatures, including a Nereid riding a sea-centaur, Eros riding a dolphin and a second Nereid riding on the back of a shield-bearing Triton appear amid fish and octopods (To Vima 5. 6. 76). Nemea. Mr S. G. Miller of the University of California, and on behalf of the American School, continued his excavation in 1975 (cf.AR 1974-75 8-9). He writes:- 'Excavations included work at Tsoungiza, the Sanctuary of Zeus, and the Stadium. The prehistoric ridge of Tsoungiza continued to produce large quantities of LH III material in a context badly dis- turbed by ploughing. Below the disturbed levels refuse pits of the early Neolithic period were further explored. These produced so much pottery and so many artifacts as to indicate a substantial settlement of this period in the vicinity. 'Within the sanctuary, the north end of the altar east of the Temple of Zeus was sought but dis- covered to have been robbed in Early Christian times. The original length of the altar cannot be determined, but the extant length is in excess of 40 m. The south end of the altar was found to be near two adjacent statue-bases of the fourth cen- tury B.C. Fragments of bronze from around these bases indicate the original material of the statues, but the identity of the figures which stood here is, as yet, unknown. 'South of the temple the kiln complex which was uncovered in 1974 was further investigated and details of its history during the late Classical and early Hellenistic periods were clarified. A well was excavated just north of the kiln complex. Gaps in its use seem to reflect periods when the Nemean games were being celebrated in Argos. Just north of the well three buildings were dis- covered which continue out of the excavated area and which are, therefore, not completely known. All three appear to date from the early fifth cen- tury B.C. Evidence was found behind one of them which indicates the presence of a sculptor's work- shop and bronze-casting pits. This evidence, to- gether with that of the kilns, should place the sacred temenos of Zeus further to the north and closer to the Temple. 'Test trenches 400 m. south of the temple revealed a fairly extensive settlement of the sixth century A.C. Its violent destruction can be dated to the 570's or 580's, and may have been a result of the Slavic invasions of that date. 'Work in the stadium (Fig. 10) resulted in the un- covering of all but the last few centimetres of the starting line at the south end of the race-course. Two major phases in the history of the starting line are discernible. In both phases there were thirteen lanes for the runners, but the width of those lanes was reduced in the later phase due to the addition at either end of the line of a projecting element like those at Epidaurus, Isthmia and else- where, which was almost certainly for a starting mechanism of some kind. Several marble statue- bases indicate that the stadium had been adorned with bronze statues of victorious athletes, and a fragmentary inscription places the wrestling, and presumably the other 'field events' of the Nemean Games, within the stadium. Although it is likely Fig. 10</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 11 that the Nemean Stadium belongs to the fourth cen- tury B.C. no secure chronological evidence has so far been discovered.' Argolis: Mycenae. Professor G.Mylonas (AS) continued his investigation in 1975, concentrating work on the fill between the Cyclopean wall and the (AR 1972- 73 13-14; AR 1973- 74 9; AR 1974- 75 9). This has revealed a room, and a passage ca. 2410 m. wide, which is the continuation of the road that runs the length of the west circuit of the Cyclopean wall from the Lion Gate. Towards the end of LH IIIB the north end of this passage was ii : blocked by masonry. In the southern part of the 'i : excavated area remains of substantial burnt timbers were found which seem to have formed Fig. 12 part of a wooden framework supported by posts 18 m.- 20 m. in diameter designed to give access to the rampart walk of the Citadel wall (Fig. 11). Rich deposits of Mycenaean IIIB2 and IIIC pottery were recovered in this area, including deep bowls and craters. Of particular note is a pyxis decor- ated in pictorial style with a sphinx and bird. Many fragments of terracotta statuettes were found. In an area south-east of the religious centre excava- tion alongside the supporting wall of the road lead- ing to it brought to light a remarkable painted anthropomorphic vase in the form of a woman, head unfortunately missing. About 150 m. north of the postern gate, at Plakes, an important Mycenaean house was investigated. Fig. 13 28 m. by an average width of 13'50 m. its axis is :'::::. ~:,?~-~:%..........almost exactly north-south.

Argos. The French School continued its excava- tion in 1975 at several points. P.Aupert has com- pleted the clearance of the baths by fully excavat- ing the hypocausts in areas C3 and C4 (Fig. 12). The destruction of the floors is of the period of the In K-,~~e Slav invasions or a little earlier. Supplementary &gt;~'~: K. ~~ ~investigations in the area showed that before being converted into baths the building consisted of parts A and B, opening on to a palaestra that was enclosed on all sides by a portico. North of the baths and alongside them an east-west road going in the direction of the Theatre has been partly excavated; it has six levels of metalling covering the years between the first and the sixth centuries A.D. (Fig. 13). A marble head of Asclepius was found here that belongs to a statue found in the -~~i~:,,:~.::,:::~::,:,:~~ .baths in 1954. ....~~ ::.b :.:~ .. . ...~ ~D.

CATLING rest upon the cover-slabs of the monumental drain already exposed at the north-east angle. The foundations are of Hellenistic date. G. Touchais continued the exploration of the south- east flank of the Aspis hill within the area of MH occupation. The buildings are datable to the second half of the period and are constructed on almost contemporary terrace fill. Over virgin soil a thin deposit contains Late Neolithic pottery. Search for the early fortifications conjectured by Vollgraff has so far proved unsuccessful. It has not been possible so far to date the polygonal wall accura- tely. Epidauros. B. Lambrinoudakis (AS) in collabora- tion with M. Mitsos continued in 1975 the explora- tion of the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas (AR 1974- 75 10). More of the great terrace wall north of the sanctuary was exposed, including a fifth buttress. At the time of building the terrace wall, a deep depression in the bedrock had had to be levelled up for the foundation; material found in its make-up confirmed the date of construction in the third century B.C. established the previous year. The poorly built terrace north of the main wall was also investigated and more than 22 m. of it exposed. It was shown stratigraphically to be a later replace- ment, incorporating, indeed, material from the older structure. Excavation of the levels in this area produced EH, MH and, particularly, LH pot- tery. A test was made near the north corner of the Apollo temple where a number of deposits asso- ciated with the altar were examined. Above these levels was found the marble figure of a youth, the finding of whose head was reported last year. Pre- historic finds include a fine lentoid sealstone and a fragment of a stone vase depicting a ?sea- battle, probably from the same vase as a fragment previously found by I. Papadimitriou (Praktika 1950, 200, Fig. 10). Later finds include fragments of Attic Geometric pottery, terracotta figurines of archaic Argive type and embossed sheet-bronze shield-embellishments. Of early fourth century B.C. date is a fine bronze relief of Athena and Herakles from a mirror case (Ergon 1975,101-107). Porto Cheli: Halieis. W. Rudolph (University of Indiana) on behalf of the American School com- pleted the final season of excavation on the land- site in 1975. Several points were excavated. A. The south-east gate area, where the gate and immediately adjacent area were cleared (Figs. 14, 15). The semicircular tower on the, north-east side encapsulates an earlier, rectangular tower. Neither tower was bonded with the city wall. Both towers are datable to the fourth century B.C. A small structure built against the external face of the wall near the semicircular tower is perhaps to be identified as the shrine of a gate-protecting deity. Inside the town, near the gate, the ground- plan of House B-C/1 was completely excavated. Its greatest overall dimensions are 16*30 m. x 13*30 m. A possibly roofed porch has on its left the two main rooms, an antechamber and the andron, both of which probably had stuccoed walls painted red. The house well was in a corner of its paved courtyard, within easy reach of the kitchen. Apart from the latter,the house may have been two-storied. Its occupation belongs to Halieis Level A-second half of the fourth century B.C. It overlay the remains of an earlier and very similar house. Part of what was probably a very similar Figt ~~~~. Hallls :11 ....... Fig. 14 Fig. 15</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 13 type of house on the opposite side of the street was also examined. B. The Mint area (Fig. 14). Several more houses were cleared, in part or whole, providing evidence of occupation in Halieis A and B. Evidence for two-storied construction was clear. Construction methods for the houses are fairly uniform. Normally the exterior foundations along the streets feature solid, broad limestone blocks, often with pry-marks and other signs of preparation for the fitting of the orthostate course, normally cut from hard Peloponnesian conglomerate. Interior walls used smaller, sometimes poorer cut or uncut blocks, together with all kinds of rubble. The 'Mint' is a building with solid and carefully built limestone foundations 10*0 m. x 11*0 m., pi- shaped, using the inner face of the city wall as its fourth wall. The centre of the building has a large limestone basis, 0'80 m. x 0'80 m., supported on two oblong ashlars, probably suggesting that the basis carried a very heavy load. One function of this building as a mint was confirmed by the dis- covery of a fire-pit containing carbonised earth, bronze scraps and coin blanks. Mis-strikes with faint imprints of Halieis coins were also found. The building must also have been used for other public purposes; inter alia it may have been an armoury. Study of the make-up of the streets in the city show them to have been made of a compact fill of lime and sand with intermediate pebbles throughout. The crown of the road normally rises in a wide flat arc, with the wheel ruts either side doing duty as gutters. The road ballast includes a large quantity of metal slag that suggests the existence of some important industrial activity within the city. The occupation of the city falls into three main phases, A, B and C. A is the final one, lasting until the late fourth century B.C., or early third, having been built ca. 350 B.C. on the ruins of its predeces- sor, B, which flourished in the first half of the fourth century B.C. Between levels B and C is a gap of nearly half a century; level C belongs to the first half of the fifth century B.C.,though its start- ing date is obscure. The street grid seems to have been the same throughout Levels A-C, which Fig. 16 Fig. 17 means Halieis had a regular road system prior to 460/450 B.C. Below Level C is a stratum whose pottery is chiefly of seventh century B.C. date. Twelve graves were excavated in the cemetery. With the exception of a double pithos burial they were all simple inhumations, apparently falling into a number of groups each of which seems to have been covered by a tumulus. Burials date from the sixth to the fourth century B.C. Among earlier grave offerings is a decorated Lakonian cup attributable to the Boreas Painter. Another grave contained a fine Corinthian round aryballos with female protome on the handle (Figs. 16,17). LACONIA Sparta. H. W. Catling, on behalf of the British School, undertook a third season of excavation at the Menelaion (AR 1973-74 14-15;AR 1974-75 12-15). The objectives were twofold-to complete the excavation of the Mycenaean mansions on the eastern plateau (cf. plan AR 1974-75 fig. 17), and further to investigate the immediate vicinity of the Menelaion, in the hope of identifying Late Helladic structures. The main Bronze Age sequence remains unaltered by the new season's work, but there are certain important shifts of emphasis. As before, small quantities of MH material were found, without any associated structures; the pottery is of local type; neither Grey Minyan nor Matt-Painted were repre- sented. A poorly preserved adult contracted burial in a pit, without grave goods, sealed by Period I floors and later walls, should perhaps be of MH date. Earlier reports have referred to the re-used ashlar blocks of poros built into the walls of the Period II mansion; it had been suspected that their original use could have been earlier than Period I. This received confirmation when one was found built into a Period I wall in the North building. No</page><page sequence="12">14 H.W. CATLING trace has yet been found of the structure(s) to which these blocks belonged. All that remains of the Period I building-Mansion 1-has been completely excavated. Its easternmost part is damaged and incomplete, and the south side has suffered considerably from erosion. The Mansion consists of three units-A, B and C-sepa- rated by the East and West corridors. These three units are of elongated rectangular form, their long axes approximately north-south. 'A' has five rooms of unequal size; 'B' appears to be a unit of megaron type, with south-facing porch, ante-room and main room. 'C' has three, possibly four rooms. The corridors are each approximately 2 0 m.wide. In both rooms and corridors the floors, where well preserved, are of water-worn pebbles rammed into the surface of the stereo. Indirect evidence makes it almost certain that this complex lay beneath a single roof. Mansion 1 was replaced by Mansion 2, built on a completely different orientation, pulled back up to 10'0 m.both west and north of the original building line. A terrace was constructed on those two sides, retained by a buttressed wall. The build- ing of Mansion 2 may be dated to LH IIIA1 in the light of pottery deposits associated with its con- struction. Pottery found in foundation trenches of Mansion 1 may suggest a date in LH IIB for its building. Mansion 2 had been abandoned before the beginning of the LH IIIA2 period. Thus the entire history of Mansions 1 and 2 belongs to the rela- tively brief period from LH IIB-LH IIIA1, perhaps little more than a generation. The very large dump of Period III rubbish imme- diately north of the north-east corner of Mansion 2 was further excavated. No skeletons were found this year, but valuable additions have been made to the Myc. IIIB2 pottery series. The deposit con- tains earlier material and includes fragments of some very fine LH II and LH IIIA1 vessels (for example, P. 1544, a IIIA1 open vessel decorated with double axe and horns of consecration). A fine lentoid seal of jasper was found amid this rubbish. It has a design of horned sheep, and may be closely compared with LM II-IIIA seals. Fig. 18 Fig. 19 Already in 1974 two squares (K. 9 and J. 10) had been opened close to the Menelaion and partly excavated, locating a Mycenaean level (without structures) beneath deep fills containing Archaic and Classical material. It was decided to extend this exploration by cleaning the surface of the Menelaion and its immediate surroundings of the scrub, weed and loose debris by which it was covered (Figs. 18, 19). As part of this work, trenches have been opened against the Menelaion on all four sides to examine what remains of the stratigraphy associated with construction and use of the monument. Square J. 10 was completely excavated and found to contain over two metres of deposit without any structures. Since only a few metres further north the bedrock is no more than 0'20 m. below the surface, this depth of deposit was unexpected. It is possible that there had been surface quarrying for building materials during the construction of the existing Menelaion, and that the quarried area was refilled with ballast when the vicinity of the shrine was landscaped upon its completion. The upper part of this 'pit' fill, however, seems to belong to a different and much later operation, perhaps a major repair of the sanctuary terrace. From the earlier fill came a large quantity of votives-small Lakonian vases, terracottas, iron objects (obeloi, ploughshares, rings and a large orientalizing pin), standard types of Lakonian lead votives, among which wreaths were the commonest, and a series of excellent bronzes, including a com- plete phiale mesomphalos, a variety of embossed sheets and a miniature oinochoe. Most important of all are two bronzes with dedicatory inscrip- tions-a harpax inscribed 'For Helen', and a pointed aryballos of PC shape with an inscription in two concentric rings on the flat of the mouth, with a continuation on the handle. It appears to read 'Deinis dedicated these objects to Helen wife of Menelaos'. These inscriptions constitute the first direct proof that the shrine is correctly identified as that of Helen. From the trenches opened against the Menelaion itself came a large number of terracotta and lead</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 15 votives and a significant quantity of architectural fragments, including a fine marble triglyph and metope block, belonging to the shrine. From a preliminary study of this material, Professor R.A. Tomlinson would date the main structure of the present monument to ca. 500-470 B.C. The general stratigraphic situation explored in 1975 differs significantly from that reported by Wace and Droop in 1909. Their activity concen- trated particularly at the north-east corner of the shrine, and on the east slope, from which quantities of LG and early Lakonian pottery and votives were recovered. In places they found traces of Mycen- aean occupation over bedrock. By contrast, the newly investigated area to the north evidently con- tains much information for the late Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic life of the sanctuary. It is rich in finds-not least in architectural ele- ments from the present Menelaion-of types either not found by the earlier excavators, or left un- published by them. There is a particularly full series of small Lakonian bg vessels decorated with reserved bands unrepresented either in Artemis Orthia or BSA 15. In nearly every square so far excavated in the vicinity of the Menelaion numbers of squared blocks of poros have been found, none in situ. They are quite distinct from the poros blocks encountered in the Mycenaean mansions. Some are built into the structure of the Menelaion, as reused material, particularly below crepidoma level. Though full proof is lacking, it is likely that these blocks came from a major building that preceded the Menelaion. It would be of great interest to locate this hypo- thetical construction, which has rather optimisti- cally been styled the 'Old Menelaion'. Mistra. Professor A. Orlandos has published a supplement to his study of the houses of Mistra in Lakonikai Spoudai 2 (1975) 77-84. Molaoi. Miss R. Etzeoglou has described the excavation of an Early Christian basilica at Chalasmata, first discovered by deep ploughing. Both the main building and the diakonikon had figured floor mosaics, whose naivety recalls, for instance, mosaics in the Beth Alpha in Israel. The church is merely part of a large settlement of Early Christian date, perhaps to be identified with the ancient Lefkai (AE 1974, 244-57). Selegoudi. Professor N. Drandakis has published an account of mid-fifteenth century Byzantine paintings in a minute church at Lefko (Lakonikai Spoudai 2 [1975] 95-109). Mani: Paliochora. N. Drandakis (AS) examined the remains of a church of unusual type below the abandoned church of Ayios Petros. It appears to be an exceptionally wide but short three-aisled, single-apsed building. Cleaning in the church of Ayios Petros itself revealed a number of features, including wall-paintings. Drandakis has also studied and reported details of little-known Fig. 20 churches at Drys (Ayia Sotera), Pepo (Dormition), Tsipa (Panayia Tsipiotissa) and Drosopiyi (Panayia Kataphigiotissa) (Ergon 1975, 125-32). MESSENIA AND ELIS Messene. Professor A. Orlandos undertook no excavation in 1975, but the excavated remains were photographed on his behalf from the air by the balloon equipment of the Whittlesey Foundation. Photographs were also taken of the area north of the city where its great theatre is located, and of the Arcadian gate (Fig. 20) (Ergon 1975, 107-116). Messenia: Koukounara. G. Korres (AS) continued to explore the Mycenaean cemeteries in 1975. At Gouvoulari work continued in the two tomb com- plexes previously reported (AR 1974-75 17). Tomb 4 of the first group is a small built tholos containing burials associated with LH IIIA and IIIB material; an unusual structural feature is the built entrance facade unbonded with the masonry of the tholos itself. The graves of the second group include burials from LH I-LH IIIA2. It was noted that, unlike the larger tholos tombs in the Kou- kounara complex, there is no sign of later hero- cult at these graves (Ergon 1975, 132-38). Messenia: Kremmidhia. G. Korres (AS) has excavated in 1975 a previously unknown Mycenaean tumulus cemetery near the Phourtzovrysi spring. It included burials dating from LH I-LH IIIB in small tholoi, and two pithoi. Evidence of Hellenis- tic hero-cult, including animal sacrifice, was found (Ergon 1975, 137-39).</page><page sequence="14">16 H. W. CATLING Elis. N. Yalouris, in collaboration with V. Leon- Mitsopoulou, continued to examine the area of the Theatre and the South Stoa. At the Theatre, the area west of the covered conduit was investigated and a number of buildings datable to the fourth- second century B.C.were discovered orientated at right angles to the north wall of the stage and the axis of the conduit. Among the finds in this area are the remains of furnaces with a mass of slag suggesting the presence of industrial workshops, if not among these buildings then somewhere nearby. An area east of the conduit was also explored, and remains of Hellenistic buildings came to light here too. Further trenching was carried out within the koilon of the Theatre to determine whether it con- tains two structural phases; the results were in- conclusive. A number of soundings were made in the area of the South Stoa. Much late Classical, Hellenistic and Roman pottery was found; of special note is a fragmentary decorated crater datable to the end of the fourth century B.C. (Fig. 21) (Ergon 1975, 132-38). Olympia. Progress continues with the difficult task of transferring items of major sculpture from the old Museum to the new. The Praxitelean Hermes is among the most recently moved pieces (Kathemerini 16.1. 76). It was widely reported in the Greek press in 1976 that the French Government had undertaken to return 29 fragments of sculpture from the metopes and pediments of the Temple of Zeus. CENTRAL GREECE Thebes. Mrs A. Demakopoulou-Papantoniou re- ports the discovery of a MH pithos burial of a child in a building plot on the east side of the town. Grave goods included a Grey Minyan vase of early type (AAA VIII [1975] 25-28). She has also published a late Sub-Mycenaean cist tomb with two vases found in the Pavloyiannopoulos plot in Pelopidas St. It was found in a level over- lying a part of the Kadmeion immediately adjacent to the plot excavated in 1964 (AR 1963-64 13). The Fig. 21 grave may be associated with the group of eleven cist-tombs excavated by Keramopoulos near the Electran Gate (AAA VIII [1975] 86-90). Tanagra. Th. Spyropoulos (AS) continued investi- gation in 1975 of the Mycenaean settlements and cemeteries of Tanagra (AR 1974-75 17) (the eighth year of the excavation programme). Buildings excavated in the settlement at Gephyra have des- truction levels of LH IIIA2 and LH IIIB date. Of six tombs excavated at the Dendra cemetery, Tomb 3 was at once the largest and the most important, with burials covering the period LH IIIA2-LH IIIB2. Spyropoulos also published illus- trations of a figured larnax recovered in an earlier season (Ergon 1975, 17-26). Boeotia: Koronia. In 1975 Th. Spyropoulos con- tinued his investigations of the supposed Itonion (AR 1973-74 20). Work concentrated on Building A, whose stratigraphy implies use from late Archaic to early Roman times. The building may cover a Geometric cremation cemetery (Ergon 1975, 12-17). Boeotia: Akraiphnion. Further information con- cerning the excavation by Miss A. Andreiomenou of an extensive cemetery of the seventh to the fourth centuries B.C. (AR 1974-75 18) was released to the Greek press in 1976. About 400 graves have now been excavated, and more than 4000 objects re- covered. In addition to more than 2000 vases, many terracottas have been found, including several fine 'Tanagrans' (Kathemerini 31.1.76). Phokis: Kalapodhi. R. Felsch and H. Kienast, on behalf of the Cerman School, in 1973 and 1974 under- took the exploration of the temple and sanctuary site. The temple, whose construction seems no earlier than the end of the fifth century B.C., has a stylobate ca. 17'68 m. x 44'20 m.; it was a peri- style building 6 m. x 14 m. Architectural elements recovered point both to an archaic and a seventh century building on the site. A variety of archaic and classical votives have been found, but the offerings of Geometric date are more plentiful- fragments of bronze tripod-handles, bronze statuettes and bronze jewellery. These come from a terrace below the level of the temple. Des- pite the discovery of a variety of inscribed objects, it is not yet known to which deity the sanctuary was dedicated, though indirect evidence may point to Artemis Elaphebolia (AAA VIII [1975] 1-24). THESSALY Details and illustrations of a large number of Byzantine and post-Byzantine religious and secu- lar buildings throughout the region have been given by N. Nikanonos. The Archaeological Service undertook repairs and improvements at a number of them in 1970 (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 305-311). Demetrias. For the second successive year circumstances prevented the 'German Archaeo-</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 17 logical Excavations' team from carrying out further excavation. Intensive study was pursued of material from previous seasons, and great pro- gress is reported with the publication programme; four volumes are in press, and others are well advanced. Restoration of many vases from the Ayia Sophia Magoula near Larisa makes an im- portant contribution to the study of this site where the Dhimini-phase occupation is represented by five successive levels. Similar restoration work on material from Pevkakia and Demetrias is re- ported. Nea Anchialos (Phthiotic Thebes). P. Lazarides (AS) continued in 1975 his examination of Basilica Gamma (the Basilica of Archbishop Peter) (cf.AR 1974-75 19), clearing more of the buildings to the south-west of the church. At the west end of the south stoa, a succession of five floors was found. Room VIII (AR 1974-75 19, fig. 34) was almost completely excavated, and more of its intricate floor mosaic came to light. Room XIV has a floor of terracotta plaques, on which the re- mains of an iron window grille was found. Two layers of paintings had decorated the walls of this room. The eastern end of the south stoa was examined; its mosaic floor had been destroyed, but five column bases were found in situ on the stylo- bate; columns, fragmentary or complete, were associated with them. The whole stoa is 27-20 m. long. Excavation in part of the south aisle of the Basilica revealed, below the level of the mosaic floor, a number of clay slabs belonging to the floor of the building preceding the Basilica. Further work was carried out on the mosaic floors of the earlier building. Though the identity of this earlier building is as yet uncertain, finds show that its walls were very rich in painted decoration (Ergon 1975, 35-41). Goritsa. S.C. Bakhuizen (University of Utrecht) in 1975 led a team to complete the survey of the fortress (AR 1973-74 22-3); the quarries nearby were examined, the fortress wall was further in- vestigated and a statistical terrain-analysis was conducted within the walled area. The fallen blocks of the fortress wall were examined; some parados pavement slabs and some coping blocks were found; the latter suggest that the wall may after all not have been built of mud brick on a stone socle. Larisa. K. Gallts reports a stratigraphic test in 1970 in the Phrourion hill, after the accidental dis- covery of a MH cist tomb containing two vases and a bronze ring. Deep Early Bronze Age levels over- lie stereo; a Middle Bronze Age horizon is sepa- rated from the last EBA deposit by a level of burn- ing. LBA material was found only in disturbed levels, mixed with classical pottery (ADelt26 Chron 2, 300-313). Krannon. K. Galles reports a number of chance finds of inscriptions (including a fragment of an Archaic stela), architectural members, etc., with- in the area of the city. These have now been trans- ferred to the Larisa Museum (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 303-4). Magnesia: Aidinion. N. Nikonanos reports the par- tial excavation in 1970 of an Early Christian farm- ing settlement, accidentally revealed by deep plough- ing. Evidence for both viticulture and oleoculture was recovered (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 312-13). AITOLOAKARNANIA Naupactus. Ph. Petsas describes the discovery and partial investigation of Roman public buildings in the town during 1970, during the digging of a series of trenches for sewers. One may have been a bath- building; a second contained rooms floored with mosaic with simple geometric designs (ADelt26 Chron 2, 315-19). Miss I. Tsourti-Kouli has published a hoard of 474 deniers-tournois of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries found in the town (ADelt26 Chron 2, 327-28). Pleuron. Miss I. Dekoulakou has reported the dis- covery and excavation of four cist-tombs on the west slope of Gyphokastro, two at least containing PG pottery. Mycenaean pottery was found nearby. Traces of a possible Geometric enclosure wall were observed, recalling the manner of building at Vitsa (Epirus) (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 326-7). Lithovouni (Nome of Missolongi). Reports in the Greek press in February 1976 note the excavatiort by the Archaeological Service of a cemetery of inhumation graves of the fourth century B.C. at Makrinys. Finds included pottery and jewellery (Kathemerini 25. 2. 76). Mastron. Ph. Petsas reports the accidental dis- covery in the cburse of public works in 1970 on the east bank of the Achelo6s River of substantial buildings, at least one of which contained pebble floor-mosaics of Hellenistic date. These dis- coveries are not far from the acropolis hill identi- fied with ancient Paianion (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 319-320). Agrinion: Museum. Ph. Petsas has described and illustrated accessions in the year 1970, and men- tions the transfer from the National Museum of sculptures from the heroon of Alyzia and the herobn of Kalydon (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 321-3). IONIAN ISLANDS Lefkas: Spasmeni Vrysi Karyoton. Miss K. Kostoglou-Despini reports the discovery and excavation of a funerary peribolos (for another cf.AR 1973-74 24), probably a family burial plot (cist-tombs and tile-graves) in use from early Hellenistic times until the first quarter of the third century B.C.

At Aftantzes Karyoton a small cemetery of the fifth century B.C. was found accidentally during road-works in 1970. Grave goods include Attic bf palmette lekythoi (ADelt 26 Chron 2,355-56). Zakynthos. Miss P.Agallopoulou describes the excavation of a partly looted Mycenaean cemetery near Kambi. Fourteen rock-cut pit-graves have been found, roofed with cover slabs (Fig. 22). The intact graves were found to contain remains of numerous burials-an unusual feature, for pit- graves are normally used only for one or two burials. It is suggested that pit-graves were re- sorted to here as the rock is very hard for the cutting of conventional chamber-tombs. The vases recovered are of Myc. IIIA2-IIIB (?IIIC) types (ADelt 28 Mel 198-214). EPIRUS Philippias. Mrs M. Acheimastou-Potamianou reports the discovery of part of an Early Christian marble ambo (Fig. 23), apparently re-used in the (now ruined) thirteenth-century church of the Pantanassa. She suggests the possibility that it originally belonged to the ambo in the Basilica of Alkison (late fifth-early sixth century) at Nikopolis (AAA VIII [1975] 95-103). Panayia (Nome of Preveza). Mrs J. Vokotopoulou reports the discovery of ancient walls during pub- lic works. Of interest is an inscription of the first century B.C., recording the building of a shrine Fig. 22 Fig. 23 for Artemis Pasikrates by the freedman Soton (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 337). Mesopotamos. S. Dakaris (AS) returned to the Nekyomanteion after an interval of more than ten years (cf. AR 1964-65 19) and explored three points-- the basement room spanned by fifteen transverse arches supporting the room above, 2 Room 1, and 3 the semi-basement room Pi. In the basement room, or crypt, a plain vessel was found near the floor surface, perhaps in situ, together with an animal skeleton (?sheep), evidently a sacrifice to Persephone and Hades. The crypt had been cut into the natural rock, 15 m. x 4'30 m.; its height is 4-30 m. to the crown of the vault; thus the diameter of the arches equals the height of the crypt. The crypt and central shrine above may be datable to the early Hellenistic period. The lower part of Room Pi (nearly square at 9-90 m. x 10'0 m.) is cut into the rock, the upper part built partly of polygonal masonry, partly of baked brick. Finds suggest it was used as a store (Ergon 1975, 82-88). (A good recent account of the Nekyomanteion has been given by S. Dakaris in the handbook The Antiquity of Epirus: The Acheron Necromanteion: Ephyra-Pandosia-Cassope, Athens [Apollo Editions] 1973). Ephyra. S. Dakaris (AS) reports a test excavation on the Acropolis hill just outside the west section of the middle of the three fortification walls. At one point a number of human burials were found beneath a stone mound associated with pottery and metal objects. These finds are of importance for dating the middle wall, which very probably was built at the end of the Late Helladic period (Ergon 1975, 88-90). MACEDONIA Ph. Petsas has published a very detailed Chronika Archaeologika 1968-1970 in Makedonika 14,212- 381, which is prefaced, as before (cf. AR 1969-70 20), by a most careful bibliographical analysis of recent work on Macedonian studies. The account is very fully illustrated. Of note are the illustra- tions of objects in the possession of private collec- tors and dealers.</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 19 CENTRAL MACEDONIA Thessaloniki. Mrs M. Siganidou has reported the results of emergency excavation during 1970 at numerous points in the city. Gounari St, where part of a large public building of Early Christian date has come to light, with walls decorated both with mosaics and paintings (the former including a Latin inscription). The building was violently destroyed, apparently earlier than the reign of Theophilos (A.D. 829-842). Panepistimiou, Egnatias and C. Melenikou, where more than 45 m. of the proteichisma of the eastern circuit of the city wall were uncovered; parallel to it is a section of the main wall, including a large triangular tower-like projection. Its construction recalls that of the Theodosian wall. Behind it were found traces of a Roman circuit and tower, perhaps ascribable to Galerian, itself built over an earlier cemetery (30 graves were excavated) whose latest burials are of the first half of the third century B.C. The cemetery included a pipe-burial (cremation within a tile-grave inset into a heavily built stone super- structure incorporating two clay water-pipes com- municating between the top of the grave and the cremated remains). Egnatias, where remains of an important house were found with three phases of Fig. 24 occupation (two Roman, one Early Christian), with excellent quality mosaic floors. In Athena St part of a fine house of the Roman period with good mosaic and opus sectile was found. Other house remains were uncovered in Dragoumi St; again in a complex of building plots in Socrates, Ayios Dimitrios and Ioulianos (two periods, Roman and Byzantine) (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 371-393). A. Vavritsas reports the accidental discovery of four Roman marble portrait busts, datable to the second half of the second century A.D., in a build- ing plot in Odos Frangon (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 395). Pella. Ch. Makaronas has described the resump- tion in 1970 of excavation interrupted since 1964. A public building investigated at one point may have been a Gymnasium; its earlier phase is dat- able to the second half of the fourth century B.C. Tests failed to locate the site of the Theatre (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 396-400). Assiros. The British School undertook a first season of excavation at the prehistoric settlement mound of Assiros Toumba, in the Langadas Basin, between Thessaloniki and Serres (Fig. 24). The excavation is under the direction of Dr K.A. Wardle, and has the particular objective of studying the strata of the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. This work enlarges on results obtained by W. A. Heurtley during excavations forty years ago at neighbouring sites such as Saratse and Vardaroftsa. The majority of the structures distinguished in 1975 belong to the Early Iron Age and may be dated, by comparison with the finds from Saratse, between 1050 and 900 B.C. More than five build- ing phases were identified in this period and a variety of building techniques were recognized. Most walls were constructed of neatly-coursed mud-bricks interlaced with substantial oak posts which provided the support for the roof. Stone walling was also used, as well as the combination of stone and mud-brick or stone packed with clay. The best preserved house was found immediately below the surface in a subsidiary area and had been destroyed by fire (Fig. 25). This destruction level was also recognized in the main area where a series of 'cupboards' or compartments had been built against the inside of one wall. One compart- ment contained a number of large conical loom- weights and a dozen handles from different kinds of vessels which may also have been used as weights (Fig. 26). Several complete vases of Iron Age type were recovered from this destruction level. The Iron Age pottery is characterized by angular twisted handles and wheelmade grey ware. Incised decoration and Protogeometric pottery, local or imported, were both very rare. A few parallels can be seen, however, in the pottery from the Early Iron Age cemetery of Kentria on Thasos (informa- tion kindly given by Mrs Chrysanthaki: see ADelt</page><page sequence="18">20 H. W. CATLING Fig. 25 Fig. 26 26, Chron 2, 401). A number of stone moulds for different objects, including a unique decorative plaque, were found in Iron Age levels (Fig. 27). The earliest building reached was of similar mud- brick construction and had also been destroyed in an intense conflagration. This destruction is probably to be dated to the end of the Bronze Age on the basis of the association of pottery of Late Bronze and Early Iron Age type. Among other whole vases found in the main area was a typical LBA brown-burnished bowl with large splaying handles and protrusions from the rim (Fig. 28). In Fig. 27 an adjacent area a Late Mycenaean cup (Fig. 29) and a jar of EIA type were found on the same floor. This association promises to be of great importance for the chronology of the transition from Bronze to Iron Age in Central Macedonia. Fragments of Mycenaean pottery were frequent in all levels and can be divided into three categories on the basis of quality and fabric. A few fine pieces could be imports from the Argolid or the southern Aegean while the majority of sherds are well made but unambitious and suggest a nearby source, perhaps in Chalcidice where Mycenaean influence was strongest. Finally there is coarse, heavy ware decorated with broad bands of paint: this type has been found in large quantities on the surface of nearby Chrysavgi, and an origin in the Langadas basin seems probable. Decorated pottery other than Mycenaean found so far in Late Bronze Age levels is limited to the handmade pottery with comb-incision and white or</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 21 Chalcidice: Petralona. Professor A. Poulianos (AS) in 1975 resumed his stratigraphic examina- tion of this cave, interrupted in 1968. Stone tools of Lower Palaeolithic types were recovered, to- gether with quantities of animal bones. The cave may have been occupied throughout the period 500, 000-300, 000 B.C. The full significance of some human remains from the cave is under study (Ergon 1975, 72-4). Chalcidice: Torone (Sithonia). A. Cambitoglou (on behalf of the Archaeological Society and Sydney University jointly) conducted a first season of investigation on this site, and in particular its very complex fortifications. An important gate has come to light on the north-east side of the circuit. Test trenches near the gate suggest that the wall at that point was built at the end of the fourth century B.C. (Ergon 1975,67-72). Chalcidice: Vrasta. J. Touratzoglou reports the discovery in 1974 of 305 billon trachea at Palaiopyrghos, buried between A.D. 1214 and 1219 (or a little later) and discusses its numismatic importance (AAA VIII [1975] 124-27). pink paste crusting familiar from excavations at Kilindir and Chauchitsa and widespread in Bulgaria and western Roumania. Finds of particular interest include a small curved bronze knife with cast ribbing typical of the Final Bronze Age of the Lower Danube. Two small iron beads were found close by and the context of beads and knife is almost certainly Late Bronze Age. Pieria: Dion. D.Pantermalis reports excavation in 1970, including the discovery of a Roman burial in a large marble sarcophagus with gabled lid and a second, immediately adjacent, grave, a cist, one of whose cover-slabs was a reused dedicatory inscription from an altar-DIANIE. ET. COLONIS. / ANTESTIA. P. L: JUCUNDA. ARAM. D. S. P. F. C. This is almost certainly the same Antestia known as co-dedicator of a shrine to Dionysus with P. Antestius Amphio. The new text implies that Antestia was Amphio's freed- woman (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 402). Chalcidice: Ierissos. Miss E. Yiouri describes the excavation of an extensive Archaic and Classical cemetery brought to light by levelling works one kilometre north of the ancient site of Akanthos. Both cremations and inhumations occur; burials were found in both stone and clay sarcophagi (including a Clazomenian sarcophagus attributed to the Hopkinson Painter), in tile graves and pithoi. Grave goods include sub-Geometric, Late Corinthian, Attic bf and rf vases, terracotta protomai and statuettes. An Attic bf column- crater (Death of Aegisthus) had been used as a cremation urn. A local sub-Geometric skyphos was found with two Attic bf band-cups (Little Masters), a valuable synchronism for the local fabric (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 393-5). WEST MACEDONIA Nome of Kozani: Exochi. Miss A. Rhomiopoulou describes the discovery in 1970 of a cist-tomb at Koursona, of eighth century B.C. date. Its contents included a matt-painted vase and an iron spear- head (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 408). Verroia. Miss Rhomiopoulou has described a number of rescue excavations at various points in the town in 1970,where buildings and graves from Hellenistic-Byzantine came to light (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 403-6). Vergina. Miss Rhomiopoulou reports the emer- gency excavation in 1970 of four more tumuli in this cemetery (cf. e.g. M.Andronikos, Vergina i [Athens 1969]). Pottery, iron swords, bronze weapons and ornaments were found (ADelt 26 Chron 2,408). Edessa. J. Touratzoglou has published a small hoard of billon trachea. It was apparently buried in the 1230's. It is the first hoard of this date to be found in this area (ADelt 28 Mel 54-70). EAST MACEDONIA Amphipolis. D. Lazarides (AS) continued work in two areas in 1975. First, in the most northerly part of the city, where he excavated on both sides of the city wall, of which a stretch 169 m. long has now been cleared. A number of late Hellenistic and Roman tile-graves were found outside the wall; also outside the wall, but close to it, the re- mains of a well-built rectangular shrine were dis- covered; it seems to have been dedicated to a Fig. 28 Fig. 29</page><page sequence="20">22 H.W. CATLING female deity. Among offerings found in a votive deposit within the shrine is a large number of small hydriae, many of local workmanship decor- ated with a variety of stylised floral patterns. The shrine probably lasted in use to the mid-fourth century B.C. Notable buildings were also found inside the city wall, one of which is a three-room structure contemporary with the Hellenistic phase in the building of the wall. Second, he undertook further work at the grave mound at Kastas (AR 1973-74 27;AR 1974-75 20). Though the antici- pated tomb-structure has not yet been located, a number of Early Iron Age graves were found, as in earlier seasons. On the southwest flank of the mound, eleven metres below its surface, a rectangu- lar stone-built pyre has been discovered, datable to the early Hellenistic period (Ergon 1975, 41-53). Lazarides has published a summary of his recent work on the city wall in AAA VIII (1975) 56-76, where he illustrates the important sixth-century inscription referred to AR 1973-74 27. Mrs Koukouli-Chrysanthaki refers to a number of inscriptions found by chance within the ancient city during 1970, including a fragmentary text datable to the first century B.C. that refers to the cult of Artemis Tauropolos, a cult that is already attested at Amphipolis-cf. Klio 37 (1936) 51 (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 417). Amphipolis: Christian area. During 1975 E. Stikas (AS) cleared overgrowth and debris from the late Acropolis wall, preserved in places up to 2'50 m. high. It contains much re-used material from the earlier city. He completed the excavation (begun in 1973) of a Roman country house with mosaic floors. Pictorial panels illustrate the story of Poseidon and Amymone, and of the Rape of Hyllas. The style of the mosaics is of the second-third centuries A.D. (Ergon 1975, 53-60). Aidonochorion (Nome of Serres). Mrs Koukouli- Chrysanthaki reports the continuation of excava- tion in 1970 within the ancient site of Tragilos. A building of the fourth-third century B.C. was cleared, and is perhaps to be identified as a rustic shrine; a number of terracotta female protomai were found, suggesting a female deity. Nearby two cemeteries dating from the sixth century B.C. were explored. Many of the graves were richly furnished with bronzes and pottery, including Corinthian and other imported wares from south Greece which will be of value in establishing the chronology of locally-made objects (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 417-18). Antisara (Nome of Kavalla). Mrs Koukouli- Chrysanthaki reports continued excavation of the Roman and fourth-century B.C. levels of the Asklepion, and a section of the town wall, apparently datable to the sixth century B.C. (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 413). Philippi. During 1975 St. Pelekanides (AS) con- tinued his excavation at several points. He eluci- dated details of the course of the Commercial Street and Street B, cleared the steps leading from the Commercial Street to the South Stoa of the Octagon, and uncovered a 30 m. stretch of the Commercial Street whe.re it leads east parallel with the Octagon complex. Work also continued on the church preceding the Octagon; an inscription on one of its mosaic floors proves that this earlier church had been of basilican form, that it was dedicated to St Paul, and that it was built by Bishop Porphyrios (known as one of the participants in the Synod of Sardike (Ergon 1975, 62-7). THRACE Maroneia. D. Triantaphyllos lists accidental discoveries of sculpture and inscriptions made during 1970 in the area of the city. An honorific decree of the first century B .C. refers to a shrine of Serapis (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 426-29). During 1975 E. Pentazos (AS) continued his ex- ploration of the classical town (cf.AR 1973-74 28), examining a further section of the fourth-century town wall, including the foundations of a tower. Work also continued on the fourth-century B.C. house with mosaic floor. 38 /E coins of Maronia were found and A/coins of Lysimachus and Philip II (Ergon 1975, 74-76). Mesembria. Excavation in the ancient town con- tinued at several points under the direction of A. Vavritsas in 1975 (cf. AR 1973-74 28); details of the street system were clarified. Overgrowth has been cleared from the west circuit of the fortifications, notably from the north-west and south-west towers; on one of the blocks of the former is the inscription AAAMAM/BOETAAON (Ergon 1975, 76-82). Komotini. D. Triantaphyllos reports excavation and clearance in 1970 at the Byzantine fortress; several square turrets have been examined. No satisfactory dating evidence was found (ADelt 26 Chron 2,422-26). Nome of Rhodope. D. Triantaphyllos reports the discovery during 1970 of prehistoric settlements near the villages of Proskynitai (Kokkinochoma, Bousgani and Sougiout), Krovyli (Papa Ambelia), Maroneia (Yiachanou Vrysi, Ekklesias Dendra and Dias Kaya), Venna (Abar Tepe) and Moirana (Isiklik). The surface finds of pottery, etc., suggest these sites were occupied in Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age times (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 429-37). Doriscos (Nome of Evros). D. Triantaphyllos describes trial excavations at Sarayia, the hill identified as the ancient Doriscos. Parts of the town wall were traced, and a building was found associated with pottery of the fourth century B.C. (According to Herodotus vii 59, Doriscos was a Persian garrison at the time of Darius, and it was here that Xerxes reviewed his army) (ADelt 26 Chron 2,439-40).</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 23 CYCLADES Kea: Hagia Eirene. Professor J. L. Caskey has reported on work carried out during 1975. He writes: 'Excavation was limited to three very small tests where supplementary information was needed. In a pit immediately west of House A, Room 3, re- mains were found of the Middle Bronze Age settlement (Period D) just below the narrow alley of the latest important town (Period H, LM IB/ LH II), confirming previous observations that deposits of intervening stages had been cut away by one or more levellings of the central area. In House A an additional cut was made through the final floor of Room 26, exposing the bottom courses of the west wall and, by good luck, finding a few more pieces of the large jar reported in 1974 (AR 1974-75 21, fig. 37). The new fragments give us the head of a second splendid griffin and one small horizontal handle, set high on the shoulder. 'Mrs Bikaki, who has undertaken a full study of the remains of House B,which she excavated in 1961, re-opened and enlarged a trench in the alley be- tween that building and Room 36 of House A. This exposed lower parts of the walls of both houses and, under them, strata and debris of Early and Middle Bronze Age habitations. The latter are at and below sea-level in this region. 'In the workrooms primary attention was directed this year to study of the houses called A, B, L and M, the temple, and the fortifications and adjoining structures in the northern and south-eastern sec- tors; to the pottery and other objects of Periods D and F (Middle Bronze Age), Period G (LM IA/ LH II), Period H (LM IB/LH II), and a small deposit of archaic and classical Greek times; to domestic utensils in local coarse wares, among which are many whose use is not yet understood; to the large terracotta statues from the temple, and small terracotta figurines of people and animals. 'Members of our expedition followed with interest a preliminary investigation, conducted by Miss Tsipopoulou for the Archaeological Service, of a cemetery of classical Greek times which lies be- side the main coastal road between Korissia and Vourkari (Welter, AA 1954, col. 62).' Siphnos. Miss B. Philippaki continued (on behalf of the AS) her study of the acropolis site of Ayios Andreas (cf.AR 1972-73 25 and fig. 54). Clearance near the north gate showed the wall at that point in much worse preservation than that elsewhere. On the west circuit behind Tower Beta trenching exposed remains of a stairway that must have given access to the battlements. Deposits of Mycenaean IIIB pottery provide confirmation of the date of construction of the wall (Ergon 1975, 152-155). Keros. Mrs Ph. Zapheiropoulou has published illustrations of painted EC II and EC III pottery recently re-identified in the Naxos Museum re- serve collections, and discusses the relative chronology of the Keros-Syros culture (AAA VIII [1975] 79-85). Paros. D. Schilardi has made further exploration of the surface remains on the Oikonomos headland and identified ancient settlements at the nearby sites of Leivathera, Sarakinika and Sklavouna. Possible Sub-Mycenaean sherds have been found on the surface at Koukounaria (Ergon 1975,140- 145). Tenos. R. Etienne and M. A. Zagdoun continued the excavation of the French School in 1975 (cf. AR 1974-75 22), when they uncovered a large part Fig. 30 Fig. 31</page><page sequence="22">24 H.W. CATLING of the immense portico parallel to the beach (Fig. 30) and identified buildings between it and the hills to the north. The portico, 170 m. long east- west, is the largest known in Greece. It is only preserved to the third course of the crepis. Some marble blocks from the steps came to light, as well as elements of the frieze and cornice. Some marble dolphin-heads in rough style must also belong to the building. It was constructed in the second century B.C., and was destroyed in the middle of the next century. During the second century B.C.the east sector of the sanctuary was radically redesigned; left in ruins in the middle of the first century B.C., doubtless as the result of piratical raids, it was not totally abandoned, though it was never to re- cover its original form and extent. Naxos: Chalki Tragaios. N. Zias has reported the detailed examination and conservation of frescoes of the eleventh and twelfth century in the church of the Panayia Protothronos, notably in the north- west chapel (Fig. 31), in the dome, and the semi- dome of the apse. The frescoes in the dome were lifted intact for cleaning and repair, and an earlier series (yet to be studied) was brought to light (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 474-481). Delos. G. Siebert, on behalf of the French School, in 1975 completed the excavation of the building complex in the Shardhana quarter, north of the 'Ilot des bronzes', in which a hoard of clay sealings had been found in 1974 (AR 1974-75 23). This building consists of two distinct parts, a western complex which follows the standard Delian scheme of rooms arranged round a central court with mosaic floor-the oecus major composes the west flank. The eastern complex is separated by a dividing wall and is at a higher level; a corridor from the porch gives access to this part. Evi- dence suggests that the living-quarters proper were on the upper floor, traces of the fine quality of whose mosaic floors, painted wall-plaster and bronze studded doors came to light in debris. The manner of use of the ground floor is uncertain. In this form the house is evidently the result of con- siderable rearrangement, for at an earlier stage the western part at ground level had consisted of domestic quarters too. Finds included several more bronze furniture-fittings, and many more clay sealings; more than 15, 000 complete and fragmentary pieces have now been recovered. The final destruction of the complex seems to date early in the first century B.C. Rhenea. In 1975 H. M. Couillond (Lyon) excavated on behalf of the French School two elaborate funerary complexes of the late Hellenistic period constructed on the terrace overlooking the Bay of Ano Generale. These two monuments (B and C) commanded a view to the coast of Delos and the Bay of Fourni in particular. Monument C con- sisted of an exedra with an aediculum built at its centre; its facade included two columns (the capitals have not been found) surmounted by an Ionic entablature and pediment. The frieze had floral decoration (acanthus leaves and volutes). The aediculum served as the frame for a large grave stela portraying a seated woman, fragments of which were found in the court east of the build- ing. To north and south two curved porticos were built enclosing the exedra and the court; the colon- nade has been almost entirely lost. Traces of the Doric entablature have been found. The pavements of the porticos were of marble opus sectile. The aediculum covered a rectangular grave cut in the rock. Four other graves, covered by porticos and the exedra, were arranged on either side of this one; all had been completely pillaged. This is a grave complex of the type constructed to honour dead parents; once built, all further access to the graves was impossible. Monument B was of different intention (Fig. 32). It consisted of a court edged to east and north by a series of loculi and to the west by a platform supporting an aediculum; it must have been used over a period of years for successive burials. Both monuments are datable to the last quarter of the second century-early first century B.C. Thera: Akrotiri. Ch.

Marinatos at the time of his death. At Xeste 4 (see e.g. Thera vi, Plan 1) a building has been exposed in which a group of rooms, passages and bases of stairways surround a pi-shaped polythyron. This complex belongs to an upper floor. Pottery and painted and figured wall-plaster were found. At Xeste 3, four rooms of the west wing of the house were uncovered (AR 1973-74 30-31). It was here that the mag- nificent 'Spring Festival' fresco was found, excellent coloured and black-and-white illustra- tions of which have now been published in Thera vii (1976). Some fragments of relief frescoes were found in Xeste 3. Within sector Delta part of the polythyron Delta 1 was excavated to the floor and found to be full of vases. Two doorways filled with pumice were revealed in its south wall and one in the north wall. Among finds of note were a wooden three-legged table re- covered as a plaster cast of its matrix within the fill and, similarly, a rush basket (Ergon 1975, 145- 148. Thera: Sellada. N. Zapheiropoulos (AS) continued his excavation of the cemetery during 1975. In the south sector two seventh-century B.C. tombs were found, of which the first was marked by a sema and two table-like stone slabs. At the bottom of the grave-pit were remnants of a small fire, some bones and sea shells and two ovoid PC aryballoi. The second and rather later grave contained a child burial within a Cretan amphora. Several other seventh-century child burials are reported, and two cremations. Nearby, three funeral pyres of the sixth century were investigated, and another four in the north sector of the cemetery (with one of which three LC aryballoi were found). Several Roman cist-tombs were found in the south sector, some containing glass vessels and bone pins. The fragments of a fine seventh-century 'Euboean' amphora were found piled on the cover-slabs of one of the Roman tombs. Of particular interest is a 'Euboean' belly-amphora (used as an ash-urn) whose decoration introduces into the repertory of this fabric motifs drawn from orientalising geo- metric design (Ergon 1975, 148-152). Ano Kouphonisi. Mrs Ph. Zapheiropoulou in 1970 investigated a partly pillaged Early Cycladic ceme- tery at the Tzavari plot. One disturbed pit still contained three marble bowls, a dagger and a needle, both of bronze. Two undisturbed graves were excavated nearby; a tomb-marker was found still in situ. The method of burial was unusual- the dead were laid on the ground surface, their grave-offerings set beside them and on them. A level of earth was then spread over them, and a mound of stone piled over all (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 467). Donousa. Mrs Ph. Zapheiropoulou reports a further season's work in 1970 in the excavation of the Geometric settlement (AR 1970-71 24; AR 1973-74 31-32). In one area many painted vases were recovered from a fire destruction in a build- ing complex. In a second area parts of the con- temporary fortification wall have been explored; a bastion and stepped entrance are features of this protective system. The fortification wall itself has three structural phases, all datable to the Geo- metric period (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 465-67). Melos. Professor C.Renfrew continued the exca- vations of the British School at Phylakopi during 1975, in association with Mr M. S. F. Hood, former Director of the School. The aim of the work was to continue the stratigraphic studies initiated dur- ing the previous season, and to investigate further areas of the prehistoric town. Digging continued in Trench Pi-C at the north of the site, occupying space Jl, 13 of the original plan of the 1896-9 excavations.

A small assemblage of pots of the later First City were found in associa- tion on a floor. Deposits were found under this floor lying below the First City. The material from these levels is important in corroborating and extending the observations on the early levels at Phylakopi given by Duncan Mackenzie in his Day-books for the 1896-9 excavations. In the very lowest levels, immediately above bedrock, material was found in association with a line of walling, the only direct evidence of 'pre-city' structures yet found on the site. The pottery from this deposit was homogeneous, mainly heavy burnished ware (often bowl shapes) and may be equated with the Grotta-Pelos culture. The succeeding levels, be- tween these basal deposits and the First City floors, appear to continue this ceramic tradition with the addition of numerous Urfirnis sherds (including sauceboats) and black-on-buff painted wares resembling those of the Keros-Syros culture. The head of a Cycladic figurine of the canonical (folded-arm) type came from these levels. With the approval of the Archaeological Service, soundings were made outside and to the west of the city walls in order to locate the source of material from pre-city levels observed some years ago during rescue excavations by Mrs P. Zapheiro- poulou. Material of this period was found, but in mixed levels. Within the area of the Mycenaean megaron com- plex work was resumed in trench Pi-A. There is now evidence that the Mycenaean (LH IIIA) palace was preceded by a building of comparable size built in the Late Bronze I period. Unfortunately the remains were much disturbed during excava- tions in 1910 and firm dating evidence is scanty. The deep stratigraphic sounding in trench PL was resumed, revealing the base of the inside face of</page><page sequence="24">26 H. W. CATLING :^ ;:::S: ................-iS: ;i;...........

Nine sealstones were re- covered; none had hitherto been reported from Phylakopi. The several phases of occupation ob- site, served all apparently fall within the LH IIIB period. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the shrine had an earlier history, like the large structure at Hagia Eirene on Kea. In the area to the east (OLd) in levels of the same ts .period a bronze statuette of 'Smithing God' type (Fig. 35) was found. ImmThediampor.....elThe study of the important obsidian sources at Sta Nychia and Dhemenegaki continued, as did work on the geological survey. A variety of studies related to the ancient and modern environment were under- taken. OTHER AEGEAN ISLANDS Thasos: Town. The excavations of the French Fig. 34 School continued at a number of points. A. Gate of the defensive wall, which can now be dated to the LH IIIB period. The sounding continued through Late and Middle Bronze Age levels, reaching bed- rock at a depth of 6'00 m. The section here gives a clear sequence for the later occupation of the site, especially in the Mycenaean period, and com- pletes the sequence which for the early period is documented by Pi-C. Immediately south of PL on the outer (south) side of the main defensive wall, a trench PK was opened, effectively extending the section line of PL to a length of ten metres, running across the defences. An outer defensive wall was revealed, datable by LM IB pottery. At this point the 'double' fortifica- tions are the results of works undertaken during the LM IA and LM IB periods. Among notable finds is the fragment of a painted plaster 'altar' stand (Fig. 33). The importance of the Late Bronze I period was further documented by a test in Pi-S (square G3, 5 of the 1896-9 plan), adjacent to the Pillar Crypt of earlier excavations. Numerous small fresco fragments were found here, both from already known compositions (e.g. lilies) and new pieces. These were clearly associated with LM IA and LM IB pottery. The earlier attribution of the Fig. 35</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 27 Fig. 36 Fig. 37 the Silen (cf. AR 1973-74 32; AR 1974-75 25). Y. Grandjean made a sounding outside the city wall 20 m. east of the bastion adjoining the gate, obtain- ing further evidence for the rearrangement of the fortifications in the fourth century B.C. The original fifth-century foundation trench for the wall was found in places where the later repair had not removed it. At this point the masonry of the city wall is preserved 5-0 m. high (Fig. 36) (the lowest part is now below the water table). Inside the wall the houses on either side of the Road of the Silen were further studied; three periods of occupa- tion in this area can be observed. 1. In the north- east corner of the excavated area are poorly preserved remains of an industrial occupation during the sixth century B.C., including part of a small furnace associated with ash, slag and bronze scrap. Nearby, two small gold ingots (total wt. 250 grammes) came to light. 2. This was followed by the first main building phase in the late sixth century and first half of the fifth century B.C. when a house was constructed along the length of the Street of the Silen, opening on to the Street of the Rampart; there was also a similarly placed shop. In the final architectural arrangement (fourth and early third centuries B.C.)the eastern end of the area was occupied by a house opening to the south on a courtyard with its well, while the western half was occupied by two semi- detached houses each with a paved court and well. Though both houses were abandoned early in the third century B.C., one of the wells continued in use until the first century B.C. Minor work in the Gate of the Silen itself proved that the Silen relief had been raised in the fourth century B.C. when the level of the Gate itself and the Street of the Silen were raised. Also during the fourth century iron grilles had been fitted over both inlet and outlet of the drain through the thickness of the city wall, as an additional precaution. B. The Artemision. Fr Salviat and J. J. Maffre resumed the exploration of this building after a long interval. Work concentrated at three points: 1. The upper terrace, where the north-east retain- ing wall was completely cleared. 2. Two soundings were made in the immediate vicinity of the north angle of this terrace wall, outside and below the level of the terrace. Two main levels of fill were identified, in the lower of which much ash, dark earth and bone were encountered. Much Archaic pottery was found, very little of which was orientalizing. Much Attic bf of the sixth century occurred, especially cups, including Siana cups (one of which has been attributed to the Heidelberg Painter), band-cups (Fig. 37), Droop cups and Cassel cups. A previously unrecorded kalos name- Anthemionides-was found on the foot of a cup. Thasian bf is represented by many lekanai and. large skyphoi fragments. In the upper level many fragments of terracotta statuettes were found, chiefly of known types of which the earliest belongs to the seventh century, the majority being of the fifth and fourth centuries. The other sounding con- tained Late Roman deposits. Here, out of place, was a fragment of an orientalizing plate (Fig. 38) by the same hand as the horseman plate from the acropolis (for the latter, Guide de Thasos, 9, fig. 2). 3. Pas- sage of the Theoroi. A stratigraphic sounding made at right angles to the passage confirmed observations made in 1965. A public well east of the passage, partly cleared in 1965, was further Fig. 38</page><page sequence="26">28 H.W. CATLING Fig. 39 excavated to a depth of 5-50 m.; its fill contained quantities of pottery of the Imperial Roman period. C. Soundings in the Town. B. Holzman worked at two points: 1. He made a test in a small plot immediately east of the entrance to the museum, facing the 'Genoese Tower' demolished in 1931. A section of the city wall was found, preserved to an average height of 2-0 m.,which must have been the pivot between the south-east stretch of the city wall and the defensive system for the closed port. Traces were also found of a city gate that would-be-he counterpart of the Gate of the Chariot on the opposite-side of the closed port. Much material was found in this test, including three coin hoards and quantities of late sgraffito pottery of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. An inscription attests the cult of Philip II at Thasos. 2. In the Yannopoulos plot, north-east of the hypostyle room and north-west of the Herakleion where, under a thick deposit of sterile sand, the remains of a monumental altar 8-14 m. x 3-59 m. were found; it must have consisted of at least five courses of masonry (Fig. 39). This is the largest altar yet found in Thasos, and its discovery emphasises the religious importance of this area. It is possible that the hypostyle room should be taken with this altar and be interpreted as a religious building. Thasos: Mourgena. Mrs Koukouli-Chrysanthaki reports the excavation in 1970, three km. south- east of the ancient city, of twelve graves of Hellenistic-Roman date; several inscribed stelai were recovered (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 414). Thasos: Theologos. Mrs Koukouli-Chrysanthaki has described the discovery and partial excavation of a second prehistoric cemetery in the mountain- ous area between Theologos and Potos (cf.AR 1973- 74 32-34), at Larnaki, two-three km. east of the prehistoric settlement at Kastri (cf. ibid.). The graves are cists and recall those at the Kentria cemetery, north of Kastri (Mrs Chrysanthaki notes that Kentria should more properly be called Tsiganadika). Grave goods include hand-made vases, bronze weapons and ornaments, iron knives, etc. Some of the decorated pottery again recalls Troy VII B2 material (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 414-15). Thasos: Potos. Mrs Koukouli-Chrysanthaki has located an Early Bronze Age settlement on the Ayios Antonios hill; some of the decorated pottery found on the surface recalls material from Sitagroi Va and Dikili Tash BAII (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 415-16). Lesbos: Mytilene. To the details of the rescue operation on a road and built aqueduct already re- ported AR 1971-72 19, now add ADelt 26 Chron 2, 449-454. Lesbos: Lisvori. D. Hatzi reports the discovery of a settlement site occupied throughout the Bronze Age on the shore of the Gulf of Kalloni. Surface finds include Mycenaean pottery (ADelt 26 Chron 2,457). Northern Sporades: Ayios Petros. D. Theochares reports the digging in 1970 of new tests in the Neolithic settlement on this islet, in a bay on the south-west side of Kyra Panayia (AR 1973-74 33). An important Late Neolithic horizon was found, corresponding to mainland pre-Dhimini, datable to the first half of the fourth millennium B.C., and roughly comparable to the Tsangli and Arapi phases in Thessaly, to the Saliagos culture of Antiparos, and Late Neolithic in the eastern Aegean islands (Samos, Kalymnos and Kos) (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 293-6). Halonissos: Mikro Kokkinokastro. D. Theochares reports the investigation of this islet in 1970. It is immediately south of the Kokkinokastro head- land. Fossilized bone deposits were examined, including the remains of equids, gazelles, deer and bovids. Rhinoceros was also identified (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 299-300). CENTRAL CRETE Knossos. Building activity, water-development works and deep ploughing in the greater Knossos area led to a number of emergency excavations in the region during 1975/76. Late Minoan buildings and graves, PG and Geometric cemeteries, a Hellenistic shrine, Roman buildings and graves were excavated by several members of the British School, and in particular Mr R. Howell, (Knossos Fellow) on behalf of the Archaeological Service. An illustrated and expanded account of these activities is reserved for the next issue of Archaeological Reports (No. 23).</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 29 Knossos: Ayios Ioannis. St. Alexiou (AS) describes the chance discovery at the locality Penteve of traces of an important building. Important inscrip- tions of the first or second century A.D.were found nearby, of which one hints that the building might be an Artemision, a second that there may be an important cemetery in the vicinity. Yet another inscription is a seven-line Latin text which honours the Emperor Nero and refers to the hand- ing over of a road to the Colonia Julia Nobilis of Knossos at the instigation of the proconsul (Ergon 1975,199-201). Knossos: Spilia. Miss A. Lembessis (AS) reports the excavation of a pillaged Roman rock-cut chamber-tomb. Glass vessels, lamps and coins date its use to the second half of the first century A.D. (Ergon 1975, 199). Herakleion. A Geometric grave containing three cremation urns was reported to have been found at Mastamba early in 1976 (Eleftheros Kosmos 20. 2. 76). Arkhanes. I. Sakellarakis (AS) has continued his excavation of this exceptionally rich and important Minoan cemetery at Phourni (AR 1974-75 27, fig. 51). Two new tholos tombs, Delta and Epsilon, and a funerary chamber (Building 16) attached to the latter have been investigated. The last (of prepalatial date) had been almost entirely des- troyed by cultivation. Tholos Epsilon was first used in EM II (and is thus the earliest structure in the cemetery) and continued in use to MM IA. The lower of its two burial levels (dated EM II) contained many offerings, including a Cycladic marble statuette. The upper, MM IA, level con- tained 31 sarcophagi and two pithoi, between them containing 71 bodies. Among the grave goods is a necklace of amethyst, sard and steatite and another of faience. Other finds include beads of gold, silver and steatite, gold leaf, obsidian blades, stone and pottery vases. Nineteen seals were found-ivory, ii i~ X4' F Fig. 40 Fig. 41 steatite, rock crystal-belonging to two chronologi- cal groups (Fig. 40). Of especial importance is the appearance of three Linear A signs painted on one of the sarcophagi below its handle, and incised signs on two other sarcophagus fragments. Tholos Delta contained the undisturbed burial of a woman, datable to LM IIIA2, with rich offerings, including a bronze mirror, a bronze 'cleaver', diadems and necklaces of gold, glass paste, sard and rock crystal, many of which were found in a painted pottery pyxis (Ergon 1975, 163-170). Miss A. Lembessis, with the collaboration of J. P. Olivier and L. Godart, has published a find of seven linear A tablets from a LM IA-B level with- in a building complex found during emergency excavations in the village (AE 1974, 113-167). Juktas. Mrs A. Karetsou (AS) continued her examination of the peak sanctuary first investi- gated by Evans (AR 1974-75 27). A number of rooms were found in the vicinity of the great terrace, some using the retaining wall of the terrace as a common west wall. The function of these rooms is not yet fully understood. The strati- graphy is confused, for MM I-III pottery is found together with LM IA, and there is much of LM IIIB type. In the most northerly area so far explored large quantities of LG pottery have been found. As well as much pottery, finds include terracotta figures covering the whole history of the cult, and bronze and lead statuettes. Of note are a fragment of a terracotta female figure of 'Gazi' type, and a fine late Daedalic head, evidently the affix from a vase (Fig. 41) (Ergon 1975, 176-78). Ayios Syllas. Mrs A. Karetsou has reported the discovery of a chamber tomb containing three larnakes, two of which are decorated with painted spirals, etc. Other grave goods include a bronze knife and a number of LM IIIB vases (Ergon 1975, 195-96). .:i m ~il . ., . .1 I 1--, M a ..</page><page sequence="28">30 H. W. CATLING Ligortino. Miss A. Mavriyannaki has published LM IIIA2 vases and painted larnakes from a tomb found here in 1896. The material is now in the Louvre (AE 1974, 45-56). Gazi. St.Alexiou has reported the chance dis- covery and excavation in 1970 of LM IIIB tombs at two different locations. One contained four larnakes and a group of small vases (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 493). The find is fully published in AE 1972, 86-98. Ayia Pelagia. St.Alexiou has commented on the evident importance of the Hellenistic town-site at which he has excavated since 1971 (see e.g. AR 1972-73 30). He has identified the remains of a building 15'0 m. x 6-30 m., constructed of fine cut-stone blocks, as its andreion-bouleuterion, comparable to those of Dreros, Axos and Lato. He proposes the identification of the site as the ancient Panormos of Ptolemy and Pliny, the name being particularly appropriate to the fine natural harbour of what is now Ayia Pelagia. It should, further, be identified as Panormos-Apollonia, destroyed by the Kydonians in 171 B.C., a date that harmonizes with the pottery from the destruction level. Consequent identifications of the locations of other north coast Hellenistic towns place Dion in the area of Fodele, immediately west of Stavros, Pantomatrion and Arion at Kastelli Mylopotamou and Stavromenos near Rethymnon, and Kytaion at Palaikastro Rogdias (Kretika Chronika 26, 32-53). Lyttos. Miss A. Lembessis reports excavations in 1970 at several points within the city. 1. Papadogeorgaki Field. Badly preserved build- ings, probably used as storerooms, were found. Pottery and coins suggest a date for their destruc- tion towards the end of the third century B.C., probably in the destruction of Lyttos by the Knossians in 220 B.C. Several large pithoi decor- ated in relief, datable to the second half of the seventh century B.C., were found in the same rooms and were, in some cases, lying on top of Hellenistic vases, illustrating the extreme long- evity of such pithoi. 2. Voreina. Traces were found here of a major building associated with pottery of the second half of the fifth century B.C. The building was cut into levels of late Archaic date. 3. Papakanteraki Field. Part of a building was exposed, datable to the first half of the second century A.D. Some of its rooms had beenplastered and painted. 4. Anemomyli. The remains of an Hellenistic building were found, again containing fragments of much earlier relief pithoi (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 493-499). Afrati. Miss A. Lembessis has reported the accidental discovery of a pithos fragment decor- ated in relief with two zones of animal figures comparable in technique to Sch'ifer, Reliefpithoi 12, fig. 3. The style recalls painted Proto- corinthian animals of the second quarter of the seventh century B.C. (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 499-500). A burial of the sixth century B.C. in a large terracotta sarcophagus decorated with stamped running spirals is reported from Orthi Petra. It contained two small vases and an iron knife as grave offerings (Ergon 1975,196-7). Kato Syme Viannou. The investigation of this most important country shrine was continued by Miss A. Lembessis (AS) during 1975 (AR 1974-75 28, and earlier refs). The most valuable dis- covery is a distinct PG level which now confirms continuity of cult activity from prehistoric to Hellenic times. Excavation continued to the deeper levels in three areas. In the area east of the Hellenic altar the three terrace walls to its south were fully uncovered. Their length is now estab- lished as at least 35'0 m. Excavation east of the MM IIIB shrine revealed part of another room to add to the three found here in 1973. The area north of the altar and west of the 'hearth' is occu- pied by the excellent masonry of the structure of which part was found in 1974. The south and west walls have now been cleared. Future work, it is hoped, will clarify both the form and the date of this construction, at present without parallel in Crete. A rich and varied series of votive offerings con- tinues to be recovered. Of outstanding interest are the fragments of what may prove to be a huge four-wheeled 'a jourc bronze stand, ultimately of Cypriot type, but here probably of Cretan manu- facture. Three PG human terracotta statuettes are noteworthy. Two more fine embossed bronze sheets depict, respectively, a huntsman with a goat and a young man apparently in the act of firing his bow in rough country. In a LM III level were found a mass of bones of sacrificed animals, parts of five stone tables of offerings, the body of a wheelmade terracotta animal figure, and a bronze bull. The latter is of great help in determining the date of a large number of bronze animals pre- viously found in mixed levels (Ergon 1975,171- 175). Gortyn. Miss A. Lembessis reports the chance discovery of a fine headless marble statuette of Pan, a Roman copy of a first century B.C. original, related to the bronze boy from Hierapetra; the detail of the drapery recalls the Tralles boy. The marble came from a roadside trench cut through a variety of buildings (including one datable to the first century A.D.) beside the road to Tymvaki (Ergon 1975, 197-8). Kyparissi. The excavation of a chamber tomb at Trapeza containing four larnakes has been re- ported by St. Alexiou. The tomb also contained painted vases of LM IIIB type and several neck- laces of glass paste (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 493). Preveliana. St.Alexiou has reported the chance find of a LM IIIB chamber tomb containing two larnakes, a number of small vases and beads of stone and glass paste. Pyrghos (Malevisi). A LM I villa has been dis- covered at Ayios Georghios, much damaged by recent cultivation (Ergon 1975, 201).</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 31 BA I I KKH 1970 - 1975 Z UV o A K h K a T 0 4I t / 4 2 I - I NOTrOS Xat 8oxa o oix;u . nMlla 1tff111 o;la 50.

Finds of pottery of Ayios Onouphrios type have been reported at the localities Alonia Kephali, Ambelia Kephali and Hadzinas Elies (Ergon 1975, 201). EASTERN CRETE Pyrghos (Kalochorio) (Nome of Lasithi). C. Davaras has described the remains of a large and surprisingly well preserved up-draught kiln found in open country near the site of the ancient town of Istron. He dates it to the Roman period (ADelt 28 Mel 110-115). Elounda (Olous). E. Borboudakis reports the excavation of an Early Christian basilica on the eastern shore of the island. A three-aisled build- ing, it appears probably to have had a brick-built dome of eastern type rather than the more usual all-wooden roof. A scrap of mosaic floor is pre- served, and fragments, including part of the base, of the marble ambo, were recovered (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 529-533). Vasiliki. A. Zoes (AS) has reported on his fourth season's work at the Minoan settlement at Kephali (Fig. 42). Progress continues in the removal of Seager's dump from the hilltop, and in uncovering previously unexplored parts of the Great House. Further study suggests that the Great House should be divided into two phases of EM IIB, of which the later is the West House, the earlier the Red (East) House. A newly excavated Room 54 (destroyed by earthquake and subsequent fire) is dated EM IIB, but it is unclear whether it belongs to either of these two houses or a third as yet unexplored to the north (which may have been destroyed by Seager). More rooms of the EM IIA North House (cf. AR 1972-73 32) have been excavated; there may be a second, contemporary house immediately to the south (Ergon 1975,189- 193). Kato Zakro. Professor N. Platon (AS) undertook in 1975 his thirteenth excavation campaign at the Minoan Palace and its dependencies. Among the more important results he reports the following: 1. New parts of the so-called 'Strong Building' were investigated beneath the east wing of the Palace. The building continues below the newly excavated Neopalatial building to the south of the Road to the Harbour. It evidently formed part of the east wing of the earlier palace, and the differ- ence of orientation is explained by its being con- structed to the line of the Road to the Harbour (AR 1973-74 40). 2. The industrial installation in the area of the Road to the Harbour (AR 1973-74 40) was fully cleared and studied; more metal waste was found with it. It apparently went out of use by 1600 B.C., at the time of the construction of the new Palace. Among finds from the over- lying fill are fragments of a plaster spiral relief frieze, possibly from a door surround. 3. Sound- ings were made in the central court of the Palace further to establish the character of the Early Palatial building; remains of the courtyard surface came to light, somewhat larger, at least, than its successor, and similarly orientated. Yet an older courtyard surface was located 0 15 m. below this one. All the pottery from beneath the two floor levels is of Early Palatial type; that between the upper floor and the floor of the central court itself contains similar material, but also MM IIIB pot- tery. From this evidence it seems certain that the remains buried beneath the existing Palace con- stitute an earlier palace. 4. Part of a Neopalatial building was excavated south of the Road to the Harbour. Special interest attaches to room V of this house which is equipped with small brick- built compartments against at least two of its walls. A crushed bronze jug was found on its floor. The southern sector of this house contained basement rooms used for storage and as working areas. It was filled in during LM IA and used as the foundation for a different storeroom complex</page><page sequence="30">32 H.W. CATLING at a higher level, datable to LM IB. 5. The Road to the Harbour has been followed for another 22 m. to a point where it starts to rise in a series of four steps. 6. A test started some years ago to determine the limit of the east wing of the New Palace was continued and 34 m. have been un- covered of what may be an enclosure wall, built on the line of an earlier one, its orientation not quite that of the New Palace. Platon also reports the discovery in a rock-cleft near the Gorge of the Dead of a deposit of MM IA pottery possibly to be attributed to a nearby peak sanctuary (Ergon 1975, 178-188). Ano Zakro. N. Platon reports the discovery at the locality Steni of a sub-Neolithic vase, the earliest ceramic find yet made in the Zakro area (Ergon 1975, 188). WEST CRETE Maroula (Rethymno). I. Papapostolou (AS) reports the excavation of a LM IIIA-B chamber tomb, con- taining three larnakes, painted vases, necklace beads and a seal-stone with the device of a winged lion (Ergon 1975,193-95). Armenoi. To the account given by I. Tzedakis of his 1970 excavation referred to AR 1971-72 26 should now be added ADelt 26 Chron 2, 513-516, with additional illustrations of LM III larnakes and painted vases. Piyi Rethymnis. I. Tzedakis reports the accidental discovery of a LM IIIA chamber tomb containing a fragmentary larnax, a bronze sword, four daggers and a knife. The sixteen painted vases represent two distinct LM IIIA phases (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 517). Chania. I. Tzedakis describes the main results of the first (1970) joint season of Greco-Swedish excavations at Kastelli, on the west side of Plateia Ayias Aikaterinas. LM mB floors were identified, with evidence of fire destruction. Earlier finds included MM II-III floors and parts of EM II build- ings, the first occasion on which structures of this date have been found at Chania. Beneath the EM II deposits, EM I and Neolithic pottery came to light (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 508-09). J. Papapostolou has published illustrations of the Linear A tablets found in Odos Katre in 1973 and in supplementary excavations in 1974, together with a number of the roundels and inscribed sealings that formed part of the same find (AAA VIII [1975] 42-55). The documents found in 1973 have now been fully published by J. Papapostolou, L. Godart and J. P. Olivier, Grammiki A sto Minoiko Arheo ton Chanion (Incunabula Graeca lxii, Rome, 1976). E. Hallager (Copenhagen) has published a Linear A tablet fragment found in 1973 during the joint Greek-Swedish excavations. It was found in a closed destruction level with vases of LM IB type (AAA VIII [1975] 90-93). Stylos (Chania). C.Davaras has given a second report in ADelt 26 Chron 2, 517-519, on the tholos tomb and LM III building referred to AR 1970-71 31. Ayia Roumeli. I. Tzedakis has described the excavation in 1970 of thirty stone-built Roman graves and six Classical pithos burials in two cemeteries near the sea at Yialos, associable with the site of the Greco-Roman town of Tarra. Finds included gold and silver jewellery, bronze and bone pins. In many cases gold or silver coins were found in the mouths of the dead (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 511). Deliana Kissamou. I. Papapostolou has reported the discovery of LM HIB painted vases from a tomb in a rock-hollow (Ergon 1975,195). DODECANESE Rhodes: City. Miss I. Zervoudakis has reported a variety of excavations, chiefly emergency, in Rhodes during 1970. At the Hasta plot the 'Base- ment room' uncovered in 1967-68 was further investigated and found originally to have been a carefully built rectangular well probably originally associated with the nearby cemetery, subsequently largely filled up and incorporated in the fourth- century walls of the city. At the Venetokleion Gymnasium plot on the south side of the city a complex system of interconnected wells and shafts linked by passages coated in hydraulic plaster was examined. Its exact function is not clear, but may be connected with the city's water supply. Nearby a number of rock-cut niches were found, whose proximity to the water-installations suggest a cult-place, possibly to be connected with an oriental deity. Sawa Nesgou plot: work in the area of the south necropolis brought to light traces of a purple dye factory (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 534-42). G. Constantinopoulos (AS) has completed his excavation of a building plot located between the ancient streets numbered Rho 27, Rho 27-beta and Rho 13. Though the remains were in poor con- dition after constant building operations in the area, traces were found of a small temple-shaped building 7 70 m. x 4-20 m., a building of stoa-type (probably in successive versions) and a rectangu- lar water-cistern. A number of Hellenistic and early Roman inscriptions were found in the stoa- like complex. Miss V. Kontorini has published briefly the texts of ten funerary inscriptions recently found in an extensive cemetery at Korakoneron. She refers to the discovery in another part of the city of the fragment of a stela recording an oath of alliance between the Cretan towns of Lyttos and Olous, and relates this text to Inscr. Cret. i, Lyttos 9, itself dated by the archon name Sosikrates to 111-110 B.C. (AAA VIII [1975] 37-41).</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1975-76 33 Fig. 43 E. Kollias has described his continued excavation in 1970 of the large basilica (cf.AR 1970-71 32). A number of ancillary buildings in the north-west corner were examined, though their purpose could not be identified. A mosaic floor incorporating a poorly preserved dedicatory inscription belongs to this group. West of the narthex a small part of the aithrion and its flanking porticos (one paved with marble slabs) was cleared. The main church has now been almost completely excavated; it is a three-aisled building more than 40 0 m. long with a tripartite south-eastern lateral extension. The latter has a two-period floor, where stone slabs cover the remains of the earlier mosaic pave- ment. The mosaic is decorated with birds and fruit within borders, as well as a number of geo- metric patterns. To the south-west is located the baptistery complete with the normal type of quatrefoil font (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 552-555). Kos: Antimachia. Miss I. Zervoudakis reports the accidental discovery of a Roman inhumation ceme- tery at Steni. Six built graves within an enclosure have been excavated. Those found undisturbed con- tained single burials accompanied by much leaf Fig. 44 gold funerary jewellery and many bottles of plain glass of types familiar in graves of the second and third centuries A.D. in Cyprus (Fig. 43) (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 545- 549). Astypalaea. Miss I. Zervoudakis has given more details of the Mycenaean tombs found at Armeno- chori (cf.AR 1972-73 32). Two chambers with long dromoi were excavated. They contained between them more than 100 vases and several bronzes, including a small cauldron and a trunnion axe; among the vases are craters, lekanai, pyxides, stemmed bowls, a tankard, kylikes, an angular kylix and stirrup jars (ADelt 26 Chron 2, 549-551). Karpathos. E. Kollias (AS) continued his explora- tion of the basilican church complex at Aphotis (AR 1974-75 26) (Fig. 44). South of the church a large walled open space of uncertain use has been cleared (21-0 m. x 11-70 m.). Within the church, a late Hellenistic inscription was found doing duty as a column-base. The five-tiered synthronon was exposed in the conch of the apse, together with the base of the episcopal throne. Trenches dug below the floor of the church show -that it rests on at least four earlier building levels. Remains of the marble components of the temblon were found re- used as floor-slabs in the bema (Ergon 1975, 159- 163). The British School at Athens H.W. CATLING</page></plain_text>
