<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion and Les Formes Élémentaires Contribution to a Study Alexander Gofman Abstract: In tracking Durkheim's Russian career, this article first explores Russian sociology during his lifetime, emphasizing its internationalism and noting Russian-related reviews in the Année sociologique. It then focuses on the issue of religion, to compare his approach with contemporary Rus sian trends, especially bogoyiskatielstvo (god quest) and bogostroyitielstvo (god building). In concluding with the Russian reception of his last great work, Les Formes élémentaires, it contrasts the circumstances before and after his death, the year of the Bolshevik Revolution, and especially com pares the responses of Nikolai Berdyaev and Pitirim Sorokin. Keywords: Nikolai Berdyaev, Émile Dürkheim, religion, Russian sociology, Pitirim Sorokin Introduction Dürkheim made his name in Russia around the same time as in France, through discussion of his ideas in books, articles and reviews, but also through translations of his work itself. Indeed, the Russian editions of La Division du travail social in 1900, of Les Règles in 1899 and of Le Suicide in 1912 were the first full translations of these texts into a foreign lan guage. Although there is still no complete Russian edition of Les Formes élémentaires, an extract was published as early as 1914. In all, seven of Durkheim's writings had appeared in a Russian version by the time of the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 and his death in November the same year.1 Thus, a basic point about Durkheim's Russian career is how quickly he became a recognized, extensively cited reference. But an equally basic point is that in the context of Russian social thought in the late nineteenth Durkheimian Studies, Volume 19, 2013: 101-124, © Dürkheim Press doi: 10.3167/ds.2013.190107 ISSN 1362-024X (Print) ISSN 1752-2307 (Online)</page><page sequence="2">Alexander Gofman and early twentieth centuries - the period with which this essay is espe cially concerned - his case was by no means extraordinary. He was one of the latest recruits to an international star cast it was au courant to debate, such as Comte, Spencer, Simmel and Tarde, but not least Marx - without doubt the most cited author, whether as a negative or a positive reference. Nor is it without relevance to note that the Russian editions of the three volumes of Das Kapital were also the first in a foreign language (in 1872, 1885 and 1896). An underlying reason why news of Dürkheim spread so rapidly in the 1890s is that the Russian 'reception' of his work took place within a milieu of intense, vibrant sociological argument and discussion.2 What an author's 'reception' in this context involved was not just a passive assimilation of ideas, but their active selection, interpretation, eval uation and processing in line with specific traditional features and current trends of Russian social thought and society. The ideas processed in this way acted not only as an external stimulus but also as an internal tool, as useful additional ammunition in arguments among Russian writers over already existing doctrines, approaches and aspirations. A detailed under standing of Durkheim's Russian career depends on tracking representatives of different tendencies and how they regarded particular works by him, as well as general projects associated with these. But before exploring, in this article, the case of Les Formes élémentaires, more should be said about the dynamics of its author's relationship with Russian sociology in this period. The Internationalism of Russian Sociology in Durkheim's Time While Dürkheim was still a student of philosophy, Evgeny de Roberty's Sot siolognia was published in Saint Petersburg in 1880 and then republished in Paris as La Sociologie in 1881.3 Russian sociology had already been devel oping for some time, through the different approaches of a variety of writ ers and the debates between them. Thanks to their views, however, most of these writers faced the censorship, harassment and persecution of the tsa rist regime. Some of them - such as Nikolai Mikhailovsky (1842-1904) and his younger colleague Nikolai Kareev (1850-1930) - managed to continue to publish in Russian within Russia itself. Others - such as Mikhailovsky's friend Pyotr Lavrov (1823-1900) - left Russia, never to return. A reason for the significance of Roberty (1842-1915) is that he exemplifies a pattern in which Russian social thinkers went abroad or indeed into exile for at least part of their career, and published at least some of their main work in languages other than Russian. They include, along with Roberty, such di verse figures as Pyotr Kropotkin (1842-1921), Yakov Novikov (1849-1912), Maksim Kovalesky (1851-1916), Moisey Ostrogorsky (1854-1919), Bogdan 102</page><page sequence="3">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion Kistiakovsky (1868-1920) and Pitirim Sorokin (1889-1968).4 Roberty and Kovalesky were especially active as representatives of Russia in interna tional sociological institutions, journals and conferences.5 An event with particular symbolic importance in its vision of a new enlightened century was the universal exhibition held at Paris in 1900. Its ambitious programme included four concurrent sociological congresses, grouped according to lan guage: Anglo-American, French, German and Russian. In offering Russian sociology an international showcase, this simultaneously confirmed and enhanced its international status, and both Roberty and Kovalevsky took a key role in organizing the proceedings.6 But the tsarist authorities, scenting revolution, conspired to close the Russian sociological congress down. An immediate consequence was the establishment in Paris in 1901 of the Rus sian School of Advanced Social Studies - L'École russe des hautes études sociales - with both Roberty and Kovalevsky again playing a leading role in this pioneering enterprise and its institution of the first Russian chair in so ciology, albeit and significantly in exile from Russia itself.7 Indeed, in 1903, and in a continuing campaign of harassment, the tsarist regime demanded Roberty's return to Russia, a demand that provoked a storm of enraged protest in the French press and a petition signed by the great and the good of French republican intellectual life, including Dürkheim himself. What might also be mentioned, for detailed discussion later, is an international enquiry on the future of religion that a French newspaper conducted in 1907, and that included Roberty among other Russian intellectuals in its survey of modern Western opinion, just as it included Dürkheim in its sam ple of their French counterparts.8 In sum, part of the context of Durkheim's Russian career was an inter nationalization of Russian sociology in which he had access to the work of a number of writers and knew some of them personally.9 However, he remarked in Le Suicide that Russia was 'still only geographically European' (1897: 13) and, apart from this, his four main books have almost no refer ences to Russia, its people or its social thinkers. On the other hand, there is more attention to them in the Année sociologique.10 It is possible to identify at least fifty Russian-related reviews and notices in the twelve volumes of the Année between 1898 and 1913, and their investigation merits a study in itself. Here, only a few basic points might be made. Dürkheim contributed sixteen of these reviews and notices, around a third of the total. Partly due to the Année's division of labour, he contrib uted all the eight items - half of his own total - on kinship, marriage and the family. Partly due to his regard for a particular author, almost all of these - seven out of eight - discussed Kovalevsky on kinship and the clan. This material, though never mentioned in Les Formes, was nonetheless involved in its development through Durkheim's key concern with socio religious kinship systems based on clans. But also and not least, a review 103</page><page sequence="4">Alexander Gofman of Kovalevsky around when Les Formes was first drafted acknowledged the interest and importance of the Russian ethnography on the clan while nonetheless regretting, thanks to its publication in Russian, its 'often diffi cult utilization' (Dürkheim 1906b: 369). Indeed, with three exceptions, the Année's fifty Russian-related re views and notices were not of Russian language texts but of publications in French (thirty), German (twelve), Italian (four) or English (one). The exceptions include an ambivalent case in the Année's first issue, in which the editor himself wrote a notice of a Russian-language work on Russian law. But he relied on a French synopsis to do so and to draw attention to the work's conclusion, which 'seems to us too important to go unreported' (Dürkheim 1898: 390). Perhaps this helped to drive home to him a need for Russian-speaking members of the Année's team to tackle a major gap in its coverage. In an episode in the Année's history that is usually overlooked and about which little is known, the contributors to its third issue included Fiodor Sigel, a professor in Warsaw (at the time part of the Russian Em pire). However, he reported on only two Russian-language publications (Si gel 1900a, 1900b), never wrote for the Année again and was never replaced by other Russian speakers. Thus, a serious limitation on the scope of the Année was its team's inability to provide an extensive coverage of Russian sociology through access to the Russian literature. For example, the 1904 review of Lettres historiques - a 1903 translation of a work that Lavrov first published in 1868 - was itself something of a historical exercise itself in its discussion of a classic in the development of Russian sociology, but in any case was the Année's only discussion of this kind. The 1904 review of Kropotkin's Mutual Aid (1902) was one of the Année's many commentaries on up-to date Russian-authored sociological work. Another was the 1900 review of Kistiakovsky's highly acclaimed thesis on society and individuality, Ge sellschaft und Einzelwesen (1899), but all his subsequent Russian-language writings were passed over in silence. The same applies to the 1901 review of a 1900 German edition of Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky's highly regarded study of the Russian factory, which was the one and only report on his overall work. Indeed, it was also the one and only report on leading con temporary representatives of different strands of Russian Marxism, who included, as well as Tugan-Baranovsky (1865-1919), Georgy Plekhanov (1856-1918), Pyotr Struve (1870-1944) and Aleksandr Bogdanov, the pen name of Aleksandr Malinovsky (1873-1928).11 Again, a brief notice in 1900 of a study translated into French constitutes the only mention of Kareev's entire output. Similarly, another brief notice in 1903 of another translation into French constitutes the only mention of the prolific writer on socio economic matters, Nikolai-on, the pen name of Nikolai Danielson (1844 1918).12 As a final instance, Kovalevsky was the Année's most reviewed but 104</page><page sequence="5">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion also respected Russian author, yet it said nothing about his two-volume magnum opus, Sotsiologuia (1910). One of the contributions of Sigel (1900a) was a brief but appreciative notice of the first two volumes of essays on the history of Russian cul ture, Ocherki po istorii russkoi kul'tury (1896, 1899), by Pavel Miliukov (1859-1943).13 The third, final volume - completed after Miliukov's ar rest and imprisonment for attending a meeting to honour the memory of Lavrov, who had just died in exile - was published in 1903. The Année never commented on this important work as a whole. But in 1901 its editor reviewed a French study that echoed Miliukov's ideas, and in 1902 re viewed an abridged French version of the essays themselves, based on the first volume. Thus, a key theme he reported, in discussing a study of the emergence in fifteenth-century Muscovy of assemblies called the Zemskié Sobors, was how, despite the apparent similarity of these assemblies with the Estates General in France and elsewhere, 'the political development of Russia was very different from that observed in Western societies'. In the West, monarchical authority arose in conflicts and struggles with already well-organized social forces. In Russia, it was the tsarist state itself that created the Sobors in creating the social ranks and functions that enabled it to operate effectively, and that no longer convened these assemblies once it established itself and 'the work for which they were born was accom plished' (Dürkheim 1901: 331-2). This was very much in line with the story already set out by Miliukov, and more or less faithfully reported in a review in which Dürkheim stated that 'what is special about the social organization of Russia is that it is entirely the work of the State'. Among Western European peoples, in contrast, 'the State resulted from the sponta neous development of society; the political organization was formed grad ually, under the influence of the country's economic, demographic and moral situation. The historical process went from bottom to top. In Russia, it was the other way round. The State had been organized before society and it was it that then organized society'. The reviewer accordingly went on to draw some conclusions about the fundamental weakness, rather than strength, of the tsarist regime. The action of the state is 'superficial and without roots', the country's political organization does not express its moral constitution and so 'can hardly have a deep impact on it', and there is thus a type of state that is 'characterized by a kind of exteriority in its relation with underlying social life' (Dürkheim 1902: 358-9). An apparently very similar picture emerges from a work by Kovalevsky on Russia's political institutions, as translated and published in French in 1903, and reviewed in the following year's issue of the Année by Paul Hourticq. 'Russia is one of the unusual countries in which the State was organized prior to the nation', 'the movement of organization was from the top, from government and not from the depths of society', and entailed 105</page><page sequence="6">Alexander Gofman 'the superficial character of the State's influence on the people'. On the other hand, a key factor was the tsarist effort to westernize, instead of de veloping 'institutions with a powerful life and existence in the old Russia' (1904: 450-2). It is also revealing to consult the immediately preceding review, by Dürkheim himself, of a work by the distinguished legal and so cial historian, Mikhail Vladimirsky-Budanov (1838-1916), although again - as in Miliukov's case - in an abridged French version. In ninth- to thir teenth-century Russia, 'the structure of society' corresponded with three 'constitutional elements of authority', 'the prince, the council of boyars or Duma and the popular assembly or Veche'. At the same time, 'the popula tion of all the Russias was conscious that it formed a whole, a moral unity', resulting in 'attempts to establish a political centre at Kiev, "mother of the Russian lands'". The reviewer then concludes that a basic lesson of all this is how, in Russia as elsewhere, 'particular States are formed . . . within larger societies, whose members feel united by links of ethnic or moral kinship' (Dürkheim 1904: 448, 450). In sum, the Année overcame limitations of access to take a relatively informed, up-to-date interest in the Russian sociological literature. Nor did it impose a monolithic doctrinal line but offered, as in the set of reviews on Russian society and the state, an ambivalent, even contradictory, but in any case challengingly problematic exploration of Russian life. However, it was not through the Année that Dürkheim made his name in Russia. It was especially through debate over his thesis on the division of labour, a debate in which Mikhailovsky, one of Russia's pioneering and most senior sociological figures, especially led the way. By the time of the launch of the Année, Dürkheim was not only beginning to develop an acquaintance with Russian sociology - there were five Russian-related reviews and notices in the first issue - but was also aware of Russian interest in his own work and of plans for Russian translations.14 It was nonetheless understandable for Kareev to complain, in an introduction to sociology he published just before this time, 'it is unlikely that Dürkheim will ever discover the exis tence of the article Mikhailovsky devoted to an analysis of The Division of Labour, and yet, of all the critiques so far generated by Durkheim's book, the most powerful and the most profound is rightly attributable to this Russian sociologist' ([1897] 1913: 396). It is also worth noting how Dürkheim was regarded by Roberty and Kovalevsky. Both of them had mixed views of his work, admiring it in many ways, yet seeing it as essentially secondary and derivative rather than as blazing new trails in social science. Indeed, Roberty claimed he had already argued for key ideas later championed by Dürkheim, not least the idea of the social as a sui generis reality, irreducible to psychology.15 But although Roberty, like Kovalevsky, was one of the Année's most frequently reviewed Russian authors, his work was repeatedly criticized as too vague, 106</page><page sequence="7">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion up in the air and unconcerned with the business of getting on and devel oping an empirically informed social science. Even so, both Roberty and Kovalevsky had a significantly supportive role in Durkheim's Russian ca reer. It was their coedited series on new ideas in sociology that published the first Russian translation of an extract from Les Formes, in which they wrote: 'It does not much matter where Dürkheim borrowed his main prin ciples and took his starting points from. What is important and invaluable is that he applies them with rare zeal and great thoroughness to the inter pretation of an immense mass of facts and raw empirical data' (Kovalevsky and Roberty 1914: 27). It was also their protégé, the young Sorokin, who wrote a glowing article on Dürkheim for one of Russia's most popular encyclopaedias. Indeed, Sorokin was Durkheim's greatest admirer among Russian sociologists, and as well as reviewing Les Formes and writing an essay on its social theory of religion, it was Sorokin who did the translation for Kovalevsky and Roberty's collection. Dürkheim, Russia and the 'Religious Question' Durkheim's interest in religion as a social phenomenon was evident long before his creation of Les Formes élémentaires, and can be traced back to the very beginnings of his sociological career.16 Moreover, religion was of central concern to him both as social scientist and citizen, and an explana tion for this can be found in its importance as an issue in the politics not just of the Third Republic but throughout the European world. However, underlying the conflicts over church, state and society, a general intellec tual challenge facing reformers was to find a viable secular alternative to a once-dominant Christian morality. And the problem was not so much the content of moral norms. It was how they had power and were accepted as legitimate. Or, in a word, it was what can replace god as a source of moral authority. The majority of French secularists conceded the fundamental character of religion as a social institution and the impossibility of its disappear ance just through legislative decrees. Many of them, following the French Enlightenment's more rationalistic currents and traditions, looked for the alternative to god in reason, but in different interpretations of this ideal, not least in differences over the nature and potential of science. Could it become the whole basis of ethics, or were there necessary limits to its role in moral life and action? A conclusion drawn by those accepting some such limits was not simply that traditional forms of religion were here to stay. Rather, it was that they could be succeeded only by other forms of religion. A representative example of this line of thought can be found in an essay on the dissolution of faith that was published during the crisis 107</page><page sequence="8">Alexander Gofman of the Dreyfus Affair by the philosopher and psychologist Ludovic Dugas. Invoking Comte's dictum that what is destroyed is only what is replaced - 'On ne détruit que ce qu'on remplace' - he identified the modern religious problem with finding a 'religious conception' that, compared with those of the past, 'would be much better able to preserve societies and resist humanity's savage instincts' (Dugas 1898: 249). This can help with situating and understanding the views of Dürkheim himself, expressed, for example, in his essay of the same year on a mod ern cult sacralizing the human person, his contribution to an enquiry of 1905 on morality without god, or a subsequent discussion in which he remarked: 'Between God and society there is a need to choose. I shall not examine here the reasons that could count in favour of one solution or the other, both of which are coherent. I add only that from my viewpoint the choice leaves me quite indifferent, since I see in the divinity only society transfigured and thought of symbolically' (Dürkheim 1906a: 75). However, it is particularly worth noting a text of 1907. Written around the time when Dürkheim started to draft Les Formes élémentaires, it was his contribution to an enquiry that asked various distinguished people from all over Europe if 'we are witnessing a dissolution or an evolution of the religious idea and of religious sentiment'. The survey, which eventually collected almost 150 responses, first appeared in a series of issues of the Mercure de France and aroused so much interest that it was then published as a book, edited by the enquiry's initiator, Frédéric Charpin (1908). Thus, it is possible to set Durkheim's response within the context of a vast, contemporary range of opinion. But what is of special concern here is how it compares with the seven contributions of leading members of the Russian intelligentsia. These included Roberty, as well as Novikov and Plekhanov, and the oth ers were Nikolai Berdyaev (1874-1948), Maksim Gorky (1868-1936), Dmi try Merezhkovsky (1865-1941) and Nikolai Minsky, pen name of Nikolai Vilenkin (1855-1937).17 A general background point is not simply the importance of the 're ligious question' in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Russia, but how discussions of social, political, economic and cultural issues were often expressed in religious terms. More specifically, this was manifested in two ideological trends known as bogoyiskatielstvo (god quest) and bogos troyitielstvo (god building), both of which testified in very different ways to a decay of traditional faith and a sense of crisis. Bogoyiskatielstvo was an important religious and philosophical move ment in early twentieth-century Russia. Known as bogoyiskatieli (god seekers), its activists organized meetings in the capital, Saint Petersburg, instituted a number of religious-philosophical societies, brought out a suc cession of journals such as New Way (1903-4), Questions of Life (1905) and Scales (1904-9), and published several collections of essays such as 108</page><page sequence="9">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion Problems of Idealism (1902) and Landmarks (1909) that enjoyed wide pop ularity and greatly influenced the intellectual atmosphere of the time. The 'god seekers' criticized official Orthodoxy and the steady decline of the church's authority and appeal, not least due to its fusion with the state. But they were also extremely concerned with the general condition of Christi anity all over the world, some of them aspiring to revive 'genuine' Ortho dox faith, others to develop a 'New Christianity'. In the 1907 enquiry, the contributions of Berdyaev, Merezhkovsky and Minsky were from leading bogoyiskatieli and convey a sense of their deeply committed, highly ideal istic and somewhat mystical 'god quest'. The bogostroyitieli (god builders) - whose ranks included a variety of radicals, revolutionaries and members of the Social Democratic Party (Bol sheviks as well as Mensheviks) - in contrast thought that gods were made rather than looked for and discovered. Like many French intellectuals, they believed that Christianity was no longer viable but also believed that re ligion was and would always be a living force. They saw it as a collective creative work of humanity, arising from the activity of the 'people's spirit'. Their approach could no doubt be linked with Comte or Feuerbach. In fact, they tended to appeal to Marx in particular and to socialism in general, which they treated as a new religion without god and with a triumphant emergence, instead, of ideas of labour, creativity, collectivism, rationality and justice. Anatoly Lunacharsky (1875-1933) was at the time one of the approach's main supporters, with a theory in which the first great reli gion was Judaism, leading on to Christianity, Islam, Spinoza's pantheism and scientific socialism. This is 'the highest form of religion', and indeed Marx's doctrine is 'the last great religion' given by Jews 'to the proletariat and to humanity' (Lunacharsky 1908: 145, 148). However, Lunacharsky later renounced these views. After the October Revolution of 1917 he be came the People's Commissar for Education in the first Soviet government, headed by Lenin, who earlier on had sharply criticized bogostroyitielstvo. In the 1907 enquiry, there were also two Russian contributors who be lieved in religion's long-term decline and consigned it to the graveyard of history. Yet while one of them was Plekhanov, Lenin's ally-turned-opponent and a founder of Russian Marxism, the other was Roberty, a long-standing critic of Marx and a champion of 'neopositivist' sociology. In any case, it is evident that the approach nearest to Durkheim's was bogostroyitielstvo. In deed, some of his closest, most attentive Russian readers were well-known 'god builders' and at the same time unorthodox Marxists. They included the 'empiricosymbolist' Pavel Yushkevich (1873-1945), author of a num ber of special works about Dürkheim and Russian translator of his thesis on the division of labour. In another example, Vladimir Bazarov - the pen name of Vladimir Rudnev (1874-1939) - had helped to prepare a new Russian edition of Marx's Das Kapital and, as well as publishing articles 109</page><page sequence="10">Alexander Gofman on Dürkheim, had translated Le Suicide.11 In the 1907 enquiry, the 'god builders' were especially represented by one of their most famous leaders, the Russian writer Gorky. But their approach also found expression in the contribution of Novikov, at the time an internationally well-known social theorist who mainly published in French and was regularly reviewed in the Année sociologique. Like Plekhanov and Roberty, both of them saw a decline and disappear ance of religion in the sense of belief in a divine being, with some sort of magical power over humanity and the universe. This was essentially because they saw an increasing enlightenment that advanced beyond 'an anthropomorphic error of the human mind' (Novikov, in Charpin 1908: 260) and that dissolved the illusory idea of god 'as much in the milieux of intellectuals as among the masses' (Gorky, in Charpin 1908: 36). Unlike Plekhanov and Roberty, they insisted on the permanent importance of reli gion and offered an idealistic vision of its future development - indeed, its revitalization and renewal - in a demystified, purer, more perfect form. In doing so, moreover, both of them injected its power to uplift with a cosmic element. Religion involves a sense of 'the infinite', according to Novikov (in Charpin 1908: 261), and a 'joyous, proud awareness of a harmonic link uniting humanity with the universe', according to Gorky (ibid.: 36). But, as Gorky's formulation makes explicit, the cosmic is integrally bound up with religion's character as a human aspiration and ideal. Thus, Gorky's contribution is especially concerned with the future of religion as a 'creative process', helping to form a 'new psychological type' and to 'perfect' human beings through the 'harmonious development of all their faculties, without contradiction between them'. This must have roots in existing, already present aspirations, but depends on evolving relations of freedom and equality in ever-widening horizons of understanding and experience - a 'problem solved by socialism'. Or, as he concludes, 'reli gious sentiment as I understand it must already exist, develop and make for human perfection' (ibid.: 37-8). Gorky's enlightened religion could be dismissed as romantic and Uto pian. But even in its appeal to a cosmic-human harmony, and in its vision of everyone's flourishing as rounded individual personalities, it is a religion penetrated by a strongly social sense of idealism, bound up with a familiar modern set of aspirations to freedom, equality and human solidarity. No vikov's demystified religion is also centrally about the ideal, but by way of a key distinction between 'dogma' and 'the cult'. The heart of religion is the cult, and the essence of the cult is not a particular passing dogma such as belief in god, but a sense of the infinite and the set of practices that, in cre ating this, create feelings of 'joy', 'bliss' and, indeed, 'religious ecstasy' in uplift to a higher level of life. It is why religion could be seen as the source of 'human grandeur and dignity', but in any case is also why religion can 110</page><page sequence="11">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion forever live and evolve, by developing through the cult better and better ways to impart a sentiment of the infinite and elevate humanity to domains of 'purity and idealism' (Novikov, in Charpin 1908: 261-2). Although Dürkheim had already become interested in the key role of the cult and of times of effervescent, even ecstatic uplift to realms of the ideal, it is left out of his contribution to the 1907 enquiry. This instead began with a long-running religious crisis, dating from the sixteenth century and involving a dissolution of the form of religion that had been constructed in the social conditions of medieval Europe and that was as impossible to revive as these conditions themselves. It nonetheless insisted that the fundamental causes that through the ages had given rise to religion would not suddenly cease to be active. It then concluded that religions of the future would be increasingly subject to science and penetrated by rational ity, but also and not least that 'the sense of the social, which has always been the soul of religions, would assert itself in them more directly and expressly than in the past, unobscured by myths and symbols' (Dürkheim, in Charpin 1908: 96-7).19 These issues reappear in Les Formes, but also, as in a talk of 1914, in Durkheim's own comments on his new book and explanation of what it was about. He organized his talk's whole developing argument around the need to understand religion, not as an affair of particular beliefs and dog mas, but in terms of a basic sense of an extraordinary force or set of forces that the faithful see as external and superior to them yet also as an integral part of their lives and source of inner strength and vitality. His solution to the problem is then to be found, not in society as such, but in the extraor dinary energy and uplift of times of collective creative effervescence. So in a perhaps uncharacteristically subjectivist remark, understanding religion depends on one's own experience of 'a sort of religious sentiment' and would otherwise be 'like a blind man trying to describe colours' (Dürkheim 1919: 309). In any case, it depends on the appreciation of a power of both individual and collective uplift that he now talked about as religion's 'dyn amogenic' impact and influence.20 This was still in the context of worrying about a modern crisis, involving a moral vacuum due to the decay of 'old ideals and the divinities that em bodied them' before any establishment of 'new ideals necessary to guide our lives' (ibid.: 312). He was nonetheless confident that the crisis, with its apparent 'moral coldness' and lack of inspirational commitments, would pass away. This was partly thanks to his faith in a general social dyna mism in which social renewal would come about, as in the past, through another great historic moment of upsurgent effervescent energies. At the same time, in the specificities of the modern case, it was also thanks to his pointing to underlying social forces that were already active and that he especially identified with the 'working classes' and demands for a 'higher ill</page><page sequence="12">Alexander Gofman justice'. But it was also due to his envisaging a future religion 'more con scious of its social origins' and, as he concluded his talk, a reaffirmation of enlightenment and the world's démystification through increasing accep tance that 'humanity is left on this earth to its own devices and can count only on itself to direct its destiny' (ibid.: 312-13). In sum, it is worth contrasting Durkheim's approach with the views not only of those who, like Plekhanov and Roberty, consigned religion to an unenlightened past but also of those who believed in the continuing rele vance and vitality of its traditional forms. This helps with appreciating how his approach involved him in basic similarities not only with 'god builders' but also with 'god seekers', who believed religion was in crisis and looked to an evolution in which it left this behind and transcended traditional forms. After the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, many of them continued to develop their ideas in exile. The enquiry of 1907 remains an interesting source on these ideas, through the contributions of Berdyaev, Merezhkovsky and Minsky. It could be said, in recalling Durkheim's for mulation of a basic choice, that they chose god over society. Or rather, it was in their concern with bringing god nearer to humanity, and so it is also important to recall Durkheim's concern with a modern cult in which the 'god' of society becomes humanity itself. A fundamental issue they saw at stake in a modern religious crisis was the need to resolve and transcend traditional dualisms, through unification of the divine and the human in a concept of 'God-man' according to Berdyaev's formulation (in Charpin 1908: 278) or of 'God-Humanity' according to Merezhkovsky's (in Charpin 1908: 122). This involved, for Berdyaev, a movement towards a universal church that transcended existing institutions, and, for Merezhkovsky, a movement towards a unifying synthesis that at last transcended old insis tent tendencies to oppose and keep rigidly separate not only the earthly and divine but the individual and impersonal, the internal and external, and the subjective and objective. Minsky, however, was perhaps the most radical modernist of them all. He envisaged a synthesis of 'two divine principles' that went beyond affirmation of god's existence to include and incorporate its negation - god's nonexistence - as 'the cornerstone' of a future enlightened religion. Indeed, he drew on the Greek for 'nonexistent' to identify his approach as 'meonism', but in any case emphasized his concern with enlightened understanding of a 'mystery' at the enduring core of religion and its combination of uplift with the 'tragic'. Its human aspirations seek in the divine an end always beyond existing human expe rience, thanks to 'the incommensurability between the relative character of our forces and the absolute character of our ideal' (Minsky, in Charpin 1908: 213-18). The role of ideals was also of central interest to Dürkheim, and so a ba sic difference with Russian 'god seekers' is to be found in his concern, not 112</page><page sequence="13">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion just with society, but also with the dynamic interrelation of the social and the ideal. As in his conclusion to Les Formes, 'a society can neither create nor recreate itself without, in the same action, creating an ideal' (Dürkheim 1912: 603). This was after his long, detailed search for the key to religion in totemism in Australia, and so one of the reasons for the work's limited Russian impact might be found in a basic difference not just with 'god seekers' but also with the intelligentsia in general. Durkheimian Australia, as a way to understand an ongoing modern crisis, seemed too roundabout and remote. The Reception of Les Formes Dürkheim launched the Année sociologique with an essay on the origins of the incest taboo, in which, taking Australia as his paradigmatic case, he rooted early elementary socioreligious life in the totemic clan. The essay was then picked out for special mention and praise in a long general re view of the new journal, published in Russia by Sigel (1899). Perhaps this resulted in Sigel's recruitment as a contributor to the Année's issue of 1900. In any case, in a Russian journal's survey of the sociological literature of 1902, another of Durkheim's major essays for the Année - on totemism - was in its turn picked out for mention and discussion by the reviewer, S. I. Galperin (1903: 369-72). Thus, even if Russian interest in Dürkheim cen tred round his earlier work's sociology of the modern world, attention was nonetheless paid to the increasing exploration of 'primitive' Australia in his essays for the Année, which helped to prepare the way for Les Formes. The publication of Durkheim's long-awaited new work was a sort of international intellectual event, which generated an impressive number and variety of reviews in different languages. One of the Russian reviews, by P. Guber, concentrated on Les Formes as a contribution to ethnology rather than sociology and indeed was headlined as concerned with 'a book on primitive religion'. In the actual discussion, it became a book on the much-debated issue of totemism that not only offered 'the fullest account' of the problem but 'showed quite convincingly that totemism was the soil built on by all subsequent layers of religious thought' (Guber 1914: 50). On the one hand, then, this acknowledged Durkheim's interest in the early and elementary as a route to understanding all religion. Thus, the review began with a critique of 'theology' as doing more damage in the study of religion than in any other sphere, though not just the traditional theology of Aquinas, for example, but also the would-be antitheology - in effect an inverted, 'negative' theology - of writers such as Comte. It was only in recent times that the picture of religion as irrational and illusionary gave way to a more objective approach, in which the science of religion 113</page><page sequence="14">Alexander Gofman has two main concerns, to appreciate the regularity and necessity of reli gious emotive experience, and to identify general, universal features of all human religious development (ibid.: 47-8). On the other hand, however, the review questioned what it saw as Durkheim's attempt to reduce ab stract categories of thought to 'a reflection of sociological data', and also worried over what it saw as his search for a full, final explanation of reli gious psychic phenomena. Such an explanation is impossible, since every religion has an irrational core that science is unable to penetrate and that 'Dürkheim too often forgets about' (ibid.: 48). Guber's review could accordingly be understood as involving a mix of the different currents of thought represented by Russian contributors to the 1907 enquiry on religion. But despite any echoes of a 'god quest' or ten dencies towards an underlying subjectivism, his position was distinct from the whole animus against sociologists - Dürkheim or whoever - expressed in a work of 1908 by the Russian Orthodox theologian, Mikhail Tareev, and in France by Simon Deploige's Le Conflit de la morale et de la sociologie (1911). Indeed, it is in the context of works such as these that Dürkheim, Roberty, Kovalevsky and others can be seen, whatever their differences, as all on the same side. Moreover, as already mentioned, Durkheim's chief Russian supporter was Roberty and Kovalevsky's protégé, Sorokin.21 The year after Les Formes came out, Sorokin published a short book (1913), written under its direct influence, on the role of symbols in social life. The following year he published a long review article of Les Formes in the journal Zavety (Sorokin 1914d), another substantial essay on it - to gether with his translation of extracts from its introduction and conclusion - in the Roberty and Kovalevsky collection (Sorokin 1914b), his encyclo paedia entry on Dürkheim (Sorokin 1914a) and a book on crime and pun ishment (Sorokin 1914c) that drew extensively on Durkheim's ideas. These are also a frequent reference in Sorokin's major, two-volume work on the system of sociology, Sistema sotsiologii, originally published in 1920 just after he had become the founder and first chair of the Department of So ciology at the University of Petrograd. Sorokin's two essays on Les Formes constitute by far the most important Russian-language commentary on the work at the time, and clearly merit a wider international recognition than they have had so far. He appears to have dispatched copies to Dürkheim himself, on the evidence of a letter from Dürkheim of June 1914 that thanks Sorokin for some of his articles, including two that are 'concerned with me specifically', and promises to ask a friend for help with translating and understanding them (Dürkheim 1996: 37). If he received this help, what would he have read? Sorokin was in general impressed, like Roberty and Kovalevsky, by Durkheim's eru dition, command of facts and skill and insight in analysing, interpreting and comparing them. But he was particularly impressed by Durkheim's 114</page><page sequence="15">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion approach to religion through an opposition between ideas of the sacred and the profane, and linked it with what he saw as a fundamentally similar distinction in Mikhailovsky's approach to religion through the social and the moral. Durkheim's theory was still a long way from resolving a whole set of complex, tangled issues. It nonetheless seemed accurate enough and on the right basic lines about the source, essence and main forms of reli gious life, 'in showing that the divinity is modelled on the collectivity and the characteristics of the divinity are modelled on the characteristics of the social group' (Sorokin 1914d: 46). Thus, Sorokin emphasized the importance, in Durkheim's theory, of re ligion's aspect as a symbolism and its role in strengthening social solidar ity, and also agreed with Durkheim's ideas on religion's future. If religion is simply understood as knowledge of the world different from scientific knowledge, then the future of religion is irreligion. But it is possible, fol lowing Dürkheim, to enlarge such a conception by starting from how, in a reality not simply identifiable with the ideas of believers, every religion consists of a set of fundamental propositions based on definite experience and on knowledge accessible to a definite group. If so, what is doomed to oblivion is 'only the fantastic, symbolic exterior of religion, not its core, which underlies this exterior and which is the division into worlds of the sacred and nonsacred'. In this perspective, there are not and there cannot be 'irreligious' people; any conception of the world depends on 'higher values', and there is always and everywhere a human need for these. So, as Sorokin goes on to conclude, what will inevitably disappear from religion is a concrete content based on defective or insufficient knowledge. What will replace this is a 'new wine', but within 'the same ancient vessels of the obligatory and nonobligatory, sacred and nonsacred, good and evil' (ibid.: 47). This was published in March 1914, Durkheim's letter hoping for help with translating it was written in June and an intervening factor in the ca reer of Les Formes was the outbreak of war in August, sparking off a whole momentous course of events. Sorokin, in his own particular involvement in these, became active in the Social Revolutionary Party, supported the tsar's overthrow in February 1917 and served as secretary to the new gov ernment's leader, Kerensky. After this government was in turn overthrown in October by the Bolsheviks, he was arrested and imprisoned on various occasions, even threatened with execution, then finally sentenced to ex ile and in 1923 arrived in the United States, where he became one of the promoters of Durkheimian sociology. Yet like Dürkheim himself, and even or especially in the turmoil of war and revolution, he set out to combine a civic commitment to action with an ethical commitment to science as an honest, unprejudiced search for truth, and indeed his politics were not immediately evident but remained in the background in his early sociolog 115</page><page sequence="16">Alexander Gofman ical work. In this sociological work, moreover, he was too serious and too free a thinker to treat anyone as an idol. Although he drew so directly and extensively on Durkheim's ideas that he considered himself a confirmed adherent of these, there were others who also had a key influence on him, such as Kovalevsky and Roberty. Many more were listed in his autobiogra phy, A Long Journey, where, characterizing the sociology he produced in his formative Russian years, he wrote that in philosophical terms 'it was a variety of empirical neo-positivism or critical realism, based upon logical and empirical scientific methods' (Sorokin 1963: 75). It was in his subse quent, American years that he moved towards a more subjectivist and in a way more traditionally Russian approach, but in any case he gradually loosened his intellectual links with Dürkheim and moved away from this classic reference in sociology to become a classic himself. Others driven into exile included such diverse figures as Berdyaev, Mili ukov, Merezhkovsky and Struve, who all ended up in Paris, where Minsky, for example, had been living since the 1900s. Just as the French capital was a centre of Russian émigré intellectual life during a first period of exile under the tsars, it again took on this role during a second period of exile under the Soviets. Thus, many Russian-language works of this time were in fact published in Paris and banned from Russia itself, where they were eventually republished after the end of the Soviet era. Although sociology had been a recognized discipline at the start of this era, it came under increasing attack as a bourgeois pseudoscience and was then effectively suppressed, under Stalinism, in the 1930s to 1950s. In Durkheim's case, the synopsis of Les Formes produced by one of his group in 1924 was repub lished in Moscow in a Russian translation (Halbwachs 1932), but as part of a collection on the origin of religion according to 'bourgeois' theorists. This was in line with the growing atmosphere in which Dürkheim was reduced to a wholly negative reference - exemplified by the entry on him in the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia's edition of 1952 - but also in which his name was surrounded by an almost absolute silence.22 Meanwhile, in France, Berdyaev had built up an international reputation as one of Russia's most distinguished émigrés.23 Deported from his home land in 1922, he arrived shortly afterwards in Paris, where he organized an Academy of Religion and Philosophy, edited a journal, Putr (The Way), and published a series of major works in Russian, quickly translated into English as well as French. In commenting in these on Durkheim's theory of religion, he approached it through earlier views, while continuing to develop them. In an exploration of the Christian doctrine and problem atic of freedom of the spirit, Filossofia svobodnogo doukha, he noted that 'Dürkheim is right when he treats religion as a social fact and derives it from society' (Berdyaev 1927-8:163). Or again, writing a few years later on the individual and community, he emphasized that the work of Dürkheim, 116</page><page sequence="17">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion as also of Marx, offers 'many sociologically valid insights into religion'. But he went on to insist that a sociological perspective was incomplete, sec ondary and unable to explain religion's living inspirational core. Although 'religion can be interpreted sociologically', the reason is that 'religion is a complex social phenomenon in which God's revelation, that is, the pure and primal religious phenomenon, merges with collective human reaction to this revelation and its utilization for different interests and concerns' (Berdyaev 1934b: 231). A comparable, contemporary critique of Dürkheim can be found in Henri Bergson's Les Deux sources de la morale et de la reli gion (1932), with its limited acceptance of sociological interpretation in the case of a 'static religion' that creates and maintains the unity of a 'closed society', but its rejection of a sociological approach to 'dynamic religion' and religion as a whole. Berdyaev was also ready to recognize the social character of knowledge, as well as of the language, concepts, rules and frameworks constituting its overall logic. Dürkheim and Lévy-Bruhl offered 'much truth' on these is sues (Berdyaev 1934b: 278). Even so, Berdyaev's personalistic philosophy opposed him to what he regarded as Durkheim's 'sociological positivism', and, indeed, in writing on the modern human condition, he described Dürkheim as a 'herald of the true sociological religion' (Berdyaev 1934a: 330). In a later work, on the kingdom of the Spirit and the kingdom of Caesar, he charged Dürkheim with 'idolatry' when accusing him of treating society as a single supreme value and of trying to establish its priority over the personality. 'Society does not exist outside of the human being and of relations between human beings, or it instead exists in alienation out side of human nature itself. The universalism of Hegel, Marx, Dürkheim, Spann, etc., which claims the primacy of society or the State over the hu man person, is a false universalism; it is based on the logic of the realism of concepts, a logic in which the general is more real than the individual' (Berdyaev 1949: 306). Berdyaev had begun his philosophical career with a critique of Mikhai lovsky's subjectivism, and then went on to sympathize with it. In one of his last works he wrote that 'Mikhailovsky, sociologist of the 1870s, was quite right in his thoughts and suggestions on the subjective method in sociology, on the struggle for individuality and on the organic ideology of societies hostile to individualism. But he had no philosophical culture; he was a positivist and was unable to give grounds for his point of view' (Berdyaev 1947: 227). Whether or not paradoxically, the change in Berdy aev's own individual position from the 'objective' towards the 'subjective' could be seen as rooted in a basic collective tendency of Russian social thought. In any case, it involved a similarity in the otherwise different in tellectual itineraries of Berdyaev and Sorokin, perhaps the leading Russian 117</page><page sequence="18">Alexander Gofman commentators on Dürkheim's sociology of religion, but undoubtedly two of the most influential and important. Conclusion There are many problems in trying to track and understand the Russian career of Durkheim's project for a social science in general and his sociol ogy of religion in particular. An example involves the whole campaign in which, even or especially in arguing for a modern cult of the individual's sacredness as a person, he emphasized the importance of the collective. In France, the campaign was directed against, and helped to counterbalance, the influence of powerful individualistic forces and traditions. In Russia, in contrast, a widespread concern among the intelligentsia was the need to emphasize the individual over and against a stifling, authoritarian collec tivism, and this might help to explain the greater appeal, compared with Dürkheim, of compatriots such as Bergson and Tarde. But, as noted at the outset, it was Marx who was by far the most important international refer ence in Russian social thought at this time. In the 1890s, one of the threats to the subjectivism championed by Mikhailovsky and others came from Durkheimian sociology. But the sever est critique came from the representatives of different currents of Russian Marxism, who variously insisted on an objective social science and who included, along with writers such as Bogdanov, Plekhanov and Struve, the young Nikolai Berdyaev and the up-and-coming Vladimir Lenin. It was not long, however, before there was a general shift towards concern, once again, with subjectivity, moral engagement and action, but that also came with tendencies towards extreme antirationalism. In one instance, Berdy aev states that 'it is necessary to take a risk, to agree to absurdity and renounce reason, to stake everything and throw oneself into an abyss; only then will the higher wisdom of faith come to light' ([1911] 2004: 67). In another, the leader of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution claimed, as a source of inspiration, Napoleon's 'On s'engage et puis ... on voit', which in his own Russian rendering means, 'Go into battle first, then see what happens afterwards' (Lenin [1923] 1964: 381). A factor in this was a cultural milieu in which pravda was championed as a term that helped to unite cognitive elements of truth (istina) with nor mative elements of justice {spravedlivost), 'life' was held up as a far more important basis of a simultaneously practical-theoretical understanding than 'science', and social issues were especially explored through genres such as the novel, the literary, philosophical or journalistic essay, the reli gious tract and the political manifesto. Indeed, works of 'art' - in a broad sense covering these genres - had enormous prestige, and many Russian 118</page><page sequence="19">The Russian Career of Dürkheim's Sociology of Religion social thinkers made their reputation through such writings rather than merely as 'social scientists'. Again, moreover, it was above all Marx who could be pressed into service as an exemplar. It is of course possible to flag up Durkheim's concern, throughout his sociological career, with a modern crisis, his commitment to action for reform, his links with socialism, his own repeated mobilization of talk of social, moral and religious 'life', but also and not least, his increasing appeal to the energies of collective creative effervescence. This was none theless in opposition to pragmatist and other expressions of a mystificatory antirationalism, while at the same time it was in an effort to overhaul a classic philosophical rationalism by looking for an underlying social logic of the apparently illogical and bizarre. That is, it was in a continuing belief in science as a way to enlightenment, and had roots in a vigorous French secular republican tradition. But despite an overlap between Durkheim's views on religion and those of some representatives of the Russian intel ligentsia, he appeared too rationalistic and too remote from the country's urgent political problems for his 'hot' faith in a 'cold' science to have many adherents. Berdyaev's ironic reference to Dürkheim as the 'herald' of a new religion was wide of the mark. He was too academic a figure to have seri ous prospects of a Russian career as a 'prophet', or for his ideas to become, as Marx would have put it, a 'material force'. Durkheim's Russian impact was modest, in that it was limited to the fo rum of scholarly social enquiry and debate, in which, although not hailed as a pioneering theorist, he won recognition and respect as an important contributor to the field. His work helped to form and articulate the ideal of sociology as an objective, rigorous, empirical science, in an approach also promoted by writers such as Kovalevsky, Miliukov, Roberty and Sorokin and taken up in neighbouring disciplines such as history, economics and legal studies. Dürkheim made at least some effort, as editor of the Année sociologique, to keep in touch with developments in Russian social science, yet appears to have been largely ignorant of the Russian reception of his own work. Indeed, it might never be known if he ever had help with trans lating and accessing Sorokin's essays on Les Formes. But perhaps he would have been happy enough with his Russian image as a social scientist rather than as a social activist and prophet.
