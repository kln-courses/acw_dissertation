<plain_text><page sequence="1">Translation and Literature 1 1 (2002) Juvenal in English. Edited by Martin M. Winkler. Pp. lxx + 488 (Penguin Poets in Translation). Harmondsworth: Penguin, 2001. Pb. Â£14.99. The last of the Roman satirists (if we exclude St Jerome), Juvenal has been an active presence in English since the sixteenth century. This latest volume in a admirable series which Penguin have now seen fit to terminate opens with Skelton and ends with a fan-tail of pieces from modern translators. Versions from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, unsurprisingly, dominate. The Romantic period supplies a coda, and the Victorian a void, punctuated only by some pieces which no anthologist should have raised from oblivion (apart from the first attempt, by the American Edward Usher, at Juvenal in blank verse) : the limp pieties of the Tractarian Isaac Williams' Christian responses, an adaptation, in wretched verse, of Satire III to Oxford, and a couple of pieces from William Shaw, who, producing a volume for 'occasions of enforced leisure, railway travelling, for instance', elects to translate Juvenal into trochaic octosyllabics which sometimes rise to a sub- Hiawatha dog-trot and sometimes fail even of that. A fresh wave of responses to Juvenal in the twentieth century comes very largely by way of translation which breaks decisively with the couplet as medium, essaying a variety of demotic styles. And in such a chronological pat- terning this volume tracks the tidal history of formal verse satire in English, with the substantial issues in larger literary and cultural history it raises - not least in the success of the latter-day American translations (or followings) by Humphries, Creekmore, and Estelle Gibson, which claim a creative affinity with Juvenal's Rome. Winkler has taken several decisions which extend, and in some ways enrich, the scope of his anthology. First, he includes not only imitations in the Augustan sense but also several poems claimed to share pre- occupations with Juvenal's. Some of the claims are tenuous: agreeable as the pieces from Defoe's True-Born Englishman or Gay's Trivia are, the justification for including them is thin (in Defoe's case reference is made to his 'series of vivid vignettes - a satiric technique indebted to Juvenal'). I certainly would have preferred to find Jonson's half- frenzied 'Epistle to a Friend, to Persuade Him to the Wars', with its Juvenalian signature line 'The whole world here, leavened with mad- ness, swells', or something from the Revenger's Tragedy, alongside the items from Poetaster and Sejanus. The extracts from Pope's Epilogue to the Satires are another matter, since Pope builds into their suave Horatian dialogue a Juvenalian intensity in the confrontation of vice, at once urbane and corrosive, and creating an image of the satirist as scourge of God, unmatched in English. To realize how essential the Horatian 93</page><page sequence="2">Reviews style is to this achievement, we need only read Thomas Gilbert's con- temporary Augustan imitation of Juvenal I, which precedes the Pope extracts, and whose vehemence comes across as bombast. One merit of this anthology is that it assists and encourages such com- parison. For Winkler's second decision has been to range widely and deal mostly in extracts. This allows him to represent five of the eleven contributors to the Dryden-Tonson Juvenal of 1693 (Tate, Stepney, Congreve, Creech, and Dryden himself), as well as predecessors of that notable collaborative undertaking (Stapylton and the much-reviled Holyday) . If the decision to go for range saddles us with such a lumpen curiosity as Edward Wentenhall's Pindaric version of Satire X, it also enables us to sample seventeenth- and eighteenth-century versions of Juvenal not readily available, and worth the reading. Dennis, for example, can meet Satire III, or Samuel Derrick Satire VIII, with Augustan compactness; and Thomas Morris' not otherwise dis- tinguished version of Satire IV's story of the giant turbot presented to Domitian felicitously recasts Juvenal's 'nihil est quod credere de se / non possit cum laudatur dis aequa potestas', with a bow to Dryden's Alexander who 'assumes the god', as: 'He who affects the god can swallow all.' The crispest instance of such interaction between texts is supplied by Winkler's third fruitful decision: to include in parallel a sample from Stepney's original version of Satire VIII for the 1693 Juvenal and Dryden's revision of it. Here we can follow Dryden's Poundian creativity (to use Charles Tomlinson's analogy) at work, and register some truth in Pope's comment on the Vast advantages' his revising bestowed. Dryden can effectively condense and so heighten, as he does with Stepney's lines 55-69. He also knows how to expand: the inelegant elaboration of 'Loud as mad Egypt when her priests have found / The horrid Divinity they fancied drowned' -Juvenal has simply 'populus quod clamat Osiri / invento' - is tightened in 'Loud as mad EGYPT, when her priests have found / A new OSYRIS, for the Ox they drowned.' Or Stepney's forward-striding couplets can be moulded (lines 23ff.) into a paragraph of static aggression of a proto-Popean kind. But, equally, the momentum they generate can be left undisturbed: Dryden's gifts as reviser include knowing when to abstain. These are examples of what this anthology makes possible by way of close analysis. Across a wider historical span we observe the first adequate Englishing of Juvenal emerge in Sir John Beaumont's version of Satire X and Chapman's of Satire V (pleasantly titled 'A Just Reproofe of a Romane Smell-Feast'). Or we may trace a continuing Popean impress in Henry Fox's 1798 political imitation of Satire III, and Hobhouse's of Satire XI in 1806, cross-refer to Wordsworth's unfinished 94</page><page sequence="3">Translation and Literature 1 1 (2002) 1790's imitation of Satire VIII, and set all of them against the American translation, also politically pointed, of Satire VII by John Quincy Adams in 1805. The headnote to the last of these refers us, in turn, to Adams' review of Gifford's translation. And so on. Such an abundance of inter- connections makes forgivable Winkler's cutting back on the amount of Dryden he gives. Still, one cannot but regret that of Satire VI, whose splenetic bravura in Dryden 's rendering needs to be experienced at length, we have only three excerpts; and that not even his version of Satire I is given entire. For, whatever the merits of his predecessors, it is with Dryden we reach an English that can fully reverberate Juvenal's Latin: Still shall I hear, and never quit the Score Stunn'd with hoarse Codrus Theseid, o're and o're? Shall this Man's Elegies and t' other's Play Unpunish'd Murther a long Summer's day? Huge Telephus, a formidable page, Cries Vengeance; and Orestes bulky rage Unsatisfy'd with Margins closely writ, Foams o're the Covers, and not finish 'd yet. Dryden takes us near the core of his own engagement with and by Juvenal when, in a passage in the prefatory Discourse concerning Satire which Winkler quotes, he breaks from a routine comparison of him with Horace to celebrate Juvenal's 'more vigorous and Masculine Wit': he gives me as much Pleasure as I can bear: He fully satisfies my Expectation, he Treats his Subject home: His Spleen is rais'd, and he raises mine . . . He drives his Reader along with him; and when he is at the end of his way, I willingly stop with him: If he went another Stage, it wou'd be too far, it wou'd make a Journey of a Progress, and turn Delight into fatigue. When he gives over, 'tis a sign the Subject is exhausted; and the Wit of Man can carry it no farther. To follow out this response and the capacities it energizes in Dryden's own verse is beyond the scope of a review like this. (One major outcome - Dryden's achievement of a transcendence at once derisive and exhil- arating in his rendering of Satire X - has been traced by David Hopkins in an admirable Translation and Literature article of 1995). But we may find a pointer in those lines from his Satire I: Achilles may in Epique Verse be slain And none of all his Myrmidons complain: Hylas may drop his Pitcher, none will cry: Not if he drown himself for company. 95</page><page sequence="4">Reviews This expands, and, in expanding, creates a certain energy of hyperbole well beyond Juvenal's 'nulli gravis percusus Achilles / aut multum quaesitus Hylas urnamque secutus'. The lines enact a brusque Olympian comedy. Extrapolating, we may register how the energy of hyperbole can channel Dryden's (belated Metaphysical) bent for the extravagant and his (Hobbesian, materialist) bent for the grotesque, as the Olympian comedy reaches out (variously) to Dryden the translator of Baucis and Philemon, of The First Book of Homer's Mas, and of Lucretius on love. (Such a comedy also takes its place alongside Dryden's Lucretius III and Juvenal X as one of his finally successful answers to that question which besets his career: how the heroic may be rendered in 'an age too late'). Dryden's recreation is one of the twin peaks of response to Juvenal in English; the other is Johnson's Vanity of Human Wishes, where satire crosses the frontier into tragedy. Dennis in his letter To Matthew Prior Esq on the Roman satirists (again, I owe this reference to Winkler) had aligned Juvenal with tragedy because he 'attacks the pernicious out- ragious Passions and the abominable monstrous Crimes of several of his Contemporaries, or of those who liv'd in the Age before him, which is the Business of Tragedy, at least of imperfect Tragedy'. One edgily creative form of 'imperfect tragedy' can be the satiric tragedy which is a less rare and paradoxical phenomenon than the tragic satire that Johnson achieves in his imitation of Juvenal X. Christopher Ricks thirty years ago proposed an affinity between the satires of Juvenal and The Revenger's Tragedy; and that Jacobean extravaganza, with its sententiaeand its fantasticated court world, stalked by morality play silhouettes, is only the most extreme of the group of Malcontent tragedies which includes Mars ton's Malcontent itself, Hamlet, The Duchess ofMalfi, perhaps Troilus and Cressida, and Timon of Athens. With their displaced, griping protag- onist-observers, and in the rhetorical zest with which they anatomize a world teemingly corrupt ('et quando uberior uitiorum copia?'), they establish a kinship with Juvenal, at least with Juvenal the agile, exploit- ing rhetorician of H. A. Mason's now classic Arion essay (best known in J. P. Sullivan's 1963 collection on Roman Satire). The creative inheri- tors of Jacobean drama have been American, from the Eliot of Gerontion through Robert Penn Warren to Lowell; and here it is interesting to observe in Lowell's version of Satire X how Juvenal's romanitas-even if acutely belated and ambiguous - works to discipline the neo-Jacobean style that had been only hectic in his Phaedra. The Malcontent tragedies reach deepest - going beyond Juvenal, though they could find launching-points in him - in their aggressive exploring of disintegration as a core tragic experience. (There may be 96</page><page sequence="5">Translation and Literature 1 1 (2002) latter-day analogues in the tragic satire on anarchism of Conrad's Secret Agent and Dostoevsky's Devils). The tragedy that Johnson builds out of Juvenal X is of another kind. It taps into an ancient paradigm, intuitive and ironical: 'evertere domos totas optantibus ipsis / di faciles'. In those Juvenal lines this intuition has narrowed to the minatory and sardonic. Johnson weights and deepens the irony, moving it further into a universe dispeopled of anthropomorphic gods: Fate wings with ev'ry Wish th' afflictive Dart, Each Gift of Nature, and each Grace of Art, With fatal Heat impetuous Courage glows, With fatal Sweetness Elocution flows, Impeachment stops the speaker's powerful Breath And restless Fire precipitates on Death. But there remains the key tragic perception of a destructive interaction between the intrinsically human and the cosmic forces that transcend it: Hope and Fear, Desire and Hate, O'erspread with Snares the clouded Maze of Fate. Here Johnson's imitation could be said to counter-write Juvenal's 'remota / erroris nebula' - and, incidentally, to draw on Dryden's trans- lation from Lucretius II: Tor life is all in wandering errors led / And just as Children are surpriz'd with dread / And tremble in the dark, so riper years / Ev'n in broad day light are possest with fears', or again in the same poem, 'humane kind / Bewildered in the Maze of Life, and blind'. It is such interaction which makes Charles XII a tragic hero, eclipsing the satiric exemplum of Hannibal, and gives his end 'destin'd to a barren Strand / A petty Fortress and a dubious Hand', a levelling and resonating irony quite beyond the clarity of scorn in Juvenal's 'sed ille / Cannarum vindex et tanti sanguinis ultor / anulus'. But it is through Juvenal that Johnson's tragic sense of life has found its fullest expression. The rich potential of this anthology qua anthology has, I hope, been done justice to. Its Introduction I found disappointing: after a crisp opening it becomes desultory, with some awkward locutions (e.g. 'the wide extent to which Juvenal came to be translated into English'), a misleading formulation about Scaliger's 'Latin work on Roman satire, the Poetices libri septem\ and the bizarre slip which informs us that Christopher Smart 'was said to be the son of Sir John Smart, Garter King-of-Arms under Edward IV'. The headnotes are generally lucid, and for each excerpt Winkler meticulously supplies the references to 97</page><page sequence="6">Reviews the equivalent lines in Juvenal. Annotation is a problem not fully soluble in any work of this kind addressed to a general audience. Winkler tackles it well for much of the time, with notes that are both deft and sparing, though readers deemed to need informing that Aphrodite is Venus are left in the dark about the identity of Henry Grattan, 'Saviour, defender of his native land', or unalerted to Charles Badham's interpolation into Satire I of Hamlet's rebuke to his mother: * Assume a virtue though thou hast it not.'
