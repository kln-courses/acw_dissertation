Breed Technologies, Ine Copyright© 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The on-going industry effort to improve air bag systems for out-of-position occupants has created the need to re- examine the existing design criteria and development means to be used in the implementation of advanced air bag technologies. Development procedures and test techniques must be augmented to include appropriate testing of the out-of-position occupant. This paper will review the development of a unique dynamic test fixture and test methodology to simulate the pre-deployment movement of an occupant concan- tenated with a conventional crash pulse on a HYGE sled. This test methodology provides for efficient development of dynamic occupant tracking systems, biomechanic algorithms and restraint system controls. INTRODUCTION Advanced adaptive restraint systems, now under devel- opment, are being designed to optimize protection for occupants of various sizes and position while minimizing inflation induced injuries. These systems will dynamically detect a combination of occupant mass, occupant posi- tion, crash severity, and belt usage. The information will be processed, and the outputs of the various restraint systems components will be modified. (1) The control of the adaptive restraints system requires development of the following: • A biomechanic algorithm: the means to describe the desired occupant response to restraint system inputs. • A control algorithm: the means to transform the sen- sor readings into restraint hardware control. • Electronic circuits and microprocessor code that fil- ters the sensor inputs and implements the control algorithms. Adaptive restraint development requires a complete understanding of the out-of-position occupant phenome- non. The occupant response to various vehicle input parameters and restraint hardware configurations and settings need to be evaluated. These conditions must be simulated and tested with the complete restraint systems, including dynamic occupant tracking with biomechanic algorithms and restraint systems controls. Current meth- ods for restraint system design, development, and valida- tion must be augmented to thoroughly and efficiently complete these tasks for the highly complex adaptive restraint systems. The authors will review the development of a new test methodology and Pre-lmpact Event (PIE) Sled Fixture. The fixture is used to simulate the movement of occu- pants during both pre-impact and crash events. This allows the total performance of dynamic tracking systems and adaptive restraint systems to be evaluated in a more realistic crash environment. OUT-OF-POSITION OCCUPANT DYNAMICS - An "out- of-position occupant" (OOPO) is defined as one who is not in his normally assumed seating position. The risk of injury to an out-of-position occupant increases when the occupant is very close to the air bag when it deploys. For every vehicle, distinctive "at-risk zones" can be defined for occupants where the injury levels produced by the air bag deployment would exceed the acceptable injury criteria as defined by FMVSS 208. This "at-risk zone" is a subset of the condition commonly referred to as an "out-of-position" occupant (OOPO). Prior to deployment, the occupant may move out-of-posi- tion due to voluntary movement, pre-impact vehicle dynamics and/or crash dynamics. The expected acceler- ations associated with these movements are shown in Table 1 . (The values shown were estimates made by the authors) 999</page><page sequence="2">Table 1 : Acceleration level associated with occupant motion. Movement Mode Acceleration Description Voluntary 0.0-0.5 g's - Occupant size - Leaning forward - Seating position Vehicle Dynamics 0.5-1.2 g's - Hard braking - Hard maneuvering - Rough road Crash Dynamics 1 .2-30 g's - Type of collision - and Vehicle crush Figure 1 describes the velocity verses displacement for these movement modes. Voluntary movements of the occupant (i.e., moving to adjust the radio or other con- trols) have slow velocities and generate large displace- ment due to the large time interval of the movement. Conversely, the occupant movement due to collision pro- duces large velocities and relatively small displacements due to the smaller time increment that the acceleration is applied prior to the air bag deployment. Occupant move- ment due to vehicle dynamics such as hard braking can produce both large velocities and large displacement prior to air bag deployment due to the length of time that the acceleration pulse is applied. Figure 1 . Occupant vicinity to IP as a function of velocity and displacement. AT-RISK CHILDREN - In most instances of air bag induced fatalities, pre-impact events, such as hard brak- ing, place the occupant out-of-position and into close proximity to the deploying air bag (2). Studies by Takeda et al, found that children sitting on the front passenger seat are more likely to sit in abnormal positions. These positions make the child unstable and susceptible to pre-deployment events. (3) Another study by Stalnacker et al determined that the time required for a human surrogate head to enter a 1 00- mm zone about the Instrument panel varied due to onsets of vehicle deceleration, the deceleration level and the initial position of the head. In all cases studied the head was the first to enter the 1 00-mm zone. (4) In over 80 % of the fatalities reported in the NHTSA data- base for children under eleven, pre-impact braking was evident. Most of these fatalities occurred under low severity crashes, with delta velocity of less than 20 mph, where the likeliness of having a late deploying air bag is high. (2) PRE-IMPACT EVENTS - Pre-impact events include hard braking, hitting a pole, tree, or other non-rigid object, or hitting a curb or rock. These events are severe enough to displace an occupant from their normally seated position, but not severe enough to trigger passive restraint sys- tems. Other general observations about the pre-impact events are as follows (3,4,5,6): • Pre-impact braking takes place in approximately 70% of frontal collisions. • Panic braking is usually classified as a 0.7 to 0.9 g pulse . • The occupants seating position prior to pre-impact braking is critical to his position just prior to impact. • Normally seated buckled or unbuckled occupants of various size ranges are affected minimally by pre- impact braking. • Smaller adults and children are more susceptible to being thrown out-of-position due to pre-impact brak- ing. This is due to lower moment of inertia, less con- tact surface area, being seated out-of-position to see better, and feet are less likely to touch the floor. • Unbelted or improperly belted occupants are more likely to be thrown out-of-position by pre-impact brak- ing. • Pre-impact braking effects "occupant sensing sys- tems" by changing the location or position of the occupant. It also imparts a multi-level velocity profile to the occupant. • Delta velocities of up to 1 1 km/hr can be achieved. METHODOLOGIES RESTRAINT DEVELOPMENT METHODS - Current occu- pant restraint systems are far less complicated than the proposed advanced adaptive restraint systems. New restraint hardware features, such as multi-level seat belt load limiters, dual or multi-level air bag inflators, variable vent cans and bags and variable function air bag tethers are being proposed for these adaptive systems. Elec- tronic features are also increasing with multiple threshold deployments, weight sensing and occupant tracking sys- tems development. Current development and test meth- ods will need to be augmented to facilitate these developments. Modeling tools such as MADYMO™, CFD, FEM, SABER™, and DADS™ (kinematics analy- sis) are used to simulate the component and system responses and appropriately size the various component 1000</page><page sequence="3">features. Correlation of the models, development and ver- ification testing of the proposed restraint systems are completed using static stand, HYGE sled and barrier tests. Static testing using anthropomorphic test devices (ATD's) are used to determine risk levels for "out-of-position" occupants. (7) Sled testing is conducted to determine the performance of the restraint system for normally seated adults. In some instances sled tests are also conducted with the ATD pre-positioned in an "out-of-position" config- uration and then tested dynamically. These simulation and test methods are adequate for pre- dicting the potential injury levels to an OOP ATD with today's systems but are not sufficient to test a complete adaptive restraint system. The current test methodolo- gies overlook the pre-deployment occupant dynamics, a very important factor in adaptive restraint system devel- opment. This development must include the simulation and response of the complete restraint systems, as well as the development and interaction of the system's sub- systems and components, i.e., the restraint hardware, the dynamic tracking sensors, the control algorithms and the electronic control and processors. The test device must be capable of simulating all pre-deployment occupant movements, as well as combinations of these move- ments. Testing the occupant tracking or suppression systems for voluntary occupant movement and/or movement by a head form or body profile at constant velocity is not diffi- cult. NHTSA in their NPRM for FMVSS 208 released in September 1998 has suggested several methods. (2,4,7). It is more difficult to simulate the pre-deployment movement coupled with the vehicle crash pulse. If this coupling can be accomplished in a sled environment, the development objectives stated in the preceding para- graph could be expeditiously completed using existing development facilities. The sled environment would also avoid the expense of conducting large quantities of full vehicle barrier tests incorporating a pre-impact decelera- tion pulse. The purpose of the test method being discussed is to simulate a pre-impact deceleration event, such as hard braking, hitting a brake-away pole, or hitting a curb, fol- lowed by a crash. By simulating the complete event, the sled is a valuable tool for not only the development of an occupant position sensor, but also as a tool to test a com- plete "advanced occupant protection system". Simulation and tests were conducted to establish repeatability of the test method. DEVELOPMENT OF PRE-IMPACT EVENT SLED - Early research of dynamic occupant sensing required the development of a small laboratory sled to simulate occu- pant movement when exposed to a low level deceleration pulse. This Pre-lmpact Event (PIE) Sled decreased the length required to place an ATD out of position (OOP) at constant velocity by exposing it to a higher deceleration for a shorter time. Although other test techniques were considered, the sled offered a more realistic simulation of various occupant properties that can affect dynamic occupant sensing. These include various modes of occupant trajectory, effective torso cross section, cloth- ing, etc. This sled was then placed within the Electronics Laboratory at Breed for rapid, repetitive testing of tracking sensors, electronic conditioning circuits, and control algo- rithms. This test technology has now been incorporated into a new fixture, a HYGE Pre-lmpact Event (PIE) Sled Fixture, to develop the biomechanical algorithm and test the total adaptive restraint system. This new fixture incorporates a more robust PIE sled mounted to a HYGE carriage that is used to duplicate the pre-impact event and concate- nate it with the vehicle crash pulse. During the pre-impact simulation phase, the occupant, its vehicle environment and the occupant tracking system are accelerated upon their own sled towards the HYGE piston. At the appropri- ate time, the HYGE sled fires and provides the crash pulse to this sled fixture. With this technology extension, the HYGE sled can be used not only for sensor develop- ment, but can also be used to develop complete restraint systems. DESCRIPTION OF PRE-IMPACT EVENT SLED OPER- ATION - To better understand the effects of sudden deceleration, a sled was developed to place an ATD out of position with a repeatable velocity. The fixture consists of a seat mounted on a horizontal surface that slides on linear bearings. The seat is accelerated using bungee cords. A winch pulls the seat and ATD to a predeter- mined distance and locks it in place. Once released the bungee cords accelerate the seat and ATD to a constant velocity then the seat is decelerated rapidly. The rapid deceleration causes the ATD to slide forward out of the seat. A loose tether around the ATD's waist stops the for- ward motion and rotates the upper torso towards the IP (see Figure 2). This fixture was developed to look at only the pre-impact event. DESCRIPTION, HYGE PRE-IMPACT SLED FIXTURE - The one limitation of the first fixture was its inability to reproduce a crash pulse at the end of the pre-impact event. To study OOP more extensively, a new fixture that simulates a pre-impact pulse followed by a crash pulse was built. This was accomplished by ruggedizing and mounting a Pre-lmpact Event Sled Fixture on a HYGE carriage. The HYGE pre-impact event sled consists of a buck that can carry an occupant, a seat, and either half of an instrument panel to simulate the driver side or passenger side of a vehicle. The buck slides on linear bearings, which are 11ft long. The bearings are mounted to an I- beam section, which mount to the HYGE sled carriage. The buck is accelerated to a constant velocity of up to 16 km/hr with a set of bungee cords and decelerated with a set of dashpots located at the end of the linear bearings. The dashpots can be adjusted, or various lengths can be 1001</page><page sequence="4">used to create different pre-impact event pulses. Short stroke dashpots can be used to produce a short duration pulse with a high acceleration. This reproduces the accelerations caused by breakaway pole, curb-hit and non-deployment level crash events. Longer stroke dash- pots can be used to produce long duration pulses at a low acceleration level to simulate hard panic braking. The tension of the bungee cords can be adjusted, to increase or decrease the buck velocity, by positioning the mounting points to increase or decrease the bungee cord length. In addition the number of bungee cords may also be increased to effect the final velocity of the buck. The cords are tensioned when the buck is pulled into position using an electric winch. Figure 2. Operation of the Pre-lmpact Event Fixture. To make pre-impact event testing work in a fixed lab envi- ronment, some design liberties had to be taken. One of the constraints faced was the usable length the buck could travel. The buck had to accelerate and decelerate within the length of the HYGE carriage. A CVC HYGE carriage has 3.6 meters of usable length. A distance of 2.1 meters was used to accelerate the buck to constant velocity. If less length were used, the acceleration on the ATD would be large and possibly displace it while bring- ing it up to speed. OPERATION OF HYGE PRE-IMPACT SLED FIXTURE - The buck is pulled back by an electric winch to begin the PIE sled sequence. When the buck reaches the desired release point, a fire signal is sent from the HYGE control room to a solenoid on the release mechanism. The buck is accelerated via the Bungee cords (Ref. Figure 3, Frame 1) and reaches a constant velocity (Frame 2). At some point during the constant velocity phase a trigger signal is sent to initiate the HYGE sled firing. There is an inherent delay in when the fire sequence is initiated and when the HYGE ram begins the crash pulse. Figure 3. HYGE Pre-lmpact Event Sled Operation When the buck reaches the end of the linear bearings it hits a pair of adjustable dashpots (Frame 3) which begins the pre-impact event motion. At this point the ATD begins to translate forward in the seat (Frame 4) and pivot about the waist (Frame 5). When the buck comes to a complete stop, it is locked in place by a ratcheting lock mechanism (Frame 5) to prevent the buck from moving backward dur- ing the event. The HYGE ram then imparts a crash pulse onto the main HYGE sled carriage (Frames 6-8) and fur- ther exacerbates the ATD's pre-impact event motion. RESULTS MADYMO™ SIMULATION - A MADYMO™ model was constructed of the Pre-lmpact Event Sled and validated against the actual test results. The acceleration informa- tion from a PIE sled test was used as input into the MADYMO™ model. The predicted kinematics was com- pared to video analysis results of a PIE sled test. The displacement versus time results of the MADYMO™ vali- dation can be seen in Figure 4. 1002</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. Comparison of MADYMO™ to Real Test Using this MADYMO™ model, the results of the Pre- Impact Event Sled Fixture were compared to a 0.8g and a 1.0g deceleration brake pulse of a 270 millisecond duration concatenated with a 24km/hr crash acceleration pulse. Figure 5 shows the three displacement curves. Two distinctive slopes of displacement over time (veloc- ity) can be seen in each of the different conditions. The first slope occurs between 0 and 0.3 seconds and is associated with the pre-impact event. The second is caused by the 24km/hr crash pulse and occurs after 0.3 seconds. The PIE pulse displaces the occupant at a higher rate for a shorter duration than the 0.8g and 1.0g pre-impact brake pulses during the pre-impact phase of the event. The distance traveled by the head just prior to the 24km/ hr crash onset for the PIE pulse is most similar to the 0.8g brake pulse. The maximum displacement for the PIE pulse during the pre-impact is approximately 0.2m, while the 0.8g and 1 .0g pulses produce 0.21 and 0.3m respectively. Figure 5. Head to IP distance MADYMO™ Results The velocity of the PIE pulse initially exceeds both the 0.8g and 1.0g brake pulses but then slows to approxi- mately the same velocity as the 1 .0g pulse just prior to the 24km/hr crash onset (Figure 6). Figure 6. Head to IP velocity MADYMO™ Results The MADYMO™ simulation predicts at the time of HYGE fire that the displacement and velocity of the occupant in the PIE sled is equivalent to that obtained respectively with a .8g and 1.0 g deceleration pre-brake pulse. Thus the PIE sled would be more severe. A comparison can also be made with a 14.4km/hr no-fire crash pulse. This would provide an upper bound to judge the relative severity of the PIE sled. If one aligns the dis- placement curves with the start of the deceleration pulse instead of the 24km/hr crash pulse, these curves can then be compared to a 14.4km/hr no-fire crash pulse. Figure 7 shows these four curves. The PIE sled provides the occupant with a velocity of approximately 2m/s or one half the velocity of 4m/s found in a 14.4km/hr pole test. This graph shows that the results obtained from the HYGE PIE sled fixture lie within the realm of real world pre-impact event motions. Figure 7. Head to IP distance MADYMO™ Results PIE Comparison to 14.4km/hr no-fire crash PIE PULSE RESULTS - The actual acceleration and velocity data achieved on the PIE Sled Fixture can be seen in Figures 8 and 9. The buck is accelerated up to velocity until approximately 600ms. From 600ms to 800ms the buck maintains constant velocity, the con- stant velocity portion of the event allows the ATD to stabi- lize prior to the pre-impact event deceleration. The 1003</page><page sequence="6">pre-impact deceleration begins at approximately 870ms and lasts for a 20-30ms duration. The 24km/hr crash pulse begins at approximately 1000ms. Figure 8. PIE Buck Acceleration Figure 9. PIE Buck Velocity REPEATABILITY-HYGE PRE-IMPACT SLED FIXTURE - In order for a test devise to be a useful tool for developing occupant protection systems it must be repeatable. This is especially true of a test utilized to develop the next generation advanced air bag systems. To establish repeatability a series of tests were conducted utilizing the 3 year old, 6 year old and 5th Percentile ATD. A minimum of four tests was conducted for each size ATD. The ATDs were all tested with a pre-impact event velocity of 8 km/hr and a 24km/hr crash pulse. The 24km/hr crash pulse was obtained from a vehicle barrier test. The results of these tests can be seen in figures 10-12. Before a comparison of the curves could be made they first needed to be time corrected so that the 24km/hr crash pulse occurs at the same time frame in each test. To time correct the data an 8g target was used to shift the data. The 8g value was chosen because it was suffi- ciently higher than the pulse created by the pre-impact event pulse. The time corrected data for the 3 year old, 6 year old and 5th Percentile ATDs all show good repeatability for both portions of the event. The slopes and displacement val- ues for both the pre-impact and the crash phase are almost identical from test to test. Figure 1 0. 3 yr. old repeatability tests Figure 1 1 . 6 yr. old repeatability tests Figure 1 2. 5th % ATD repeatability tests DISCUSSION CONVENTIONAL OOP TESTING - For standard sys- tems, the PIE sled can be used to investigate the effects of air bag deployment timing on out-of-position occu- pants. The air bag deployment can be triggered by fixed time delay, by position of the moving buck on the PIE 1004</page><page sequence="7">fixture, by occupant position during the pre-impact event or acceleration level produced by the HYGE sled. Figure 13 below shows a video sequence of an air bag deployment using the PIE sled in combination with the HYGE sled. The ATD used represented a small female occupant, a 5th percentile adult ATD. • Frame 1, Figure 13, the movable buck section of the PIE sled is being accelerated after release. • Frame 2, the movable buck has been accelerated to 8-km/hr velocity immediately prior to being snubbed by the dashpots. • Frame 3, the PIE sled has been decelerated; the ATD is in free flight; the HYGE sled has been fired rear- ward with a 24km/hr pulse; the air bag has been acti- vated based on a pre-set HYGE sled acceleration level; and the air bag has started to deploy. • Frame 4, the ATD continues to move forward into the air bag. The air bag is still inflating and has not yet reached its full shape. • Frame 5, the ATD has rebounded off the bag but has yet to rebound off the seat. Figure 13. Air Bag Deployment on PIE Sled Without the PIE Sled Fixture, the laboratory would have pre-positioned the ATD statically into its deployment posi- tion; fired the HYGE with a 32km/hr pulse and fired the air bag with a pre-set delay after the initiation of the pulse. A test series has been planned to evaluate the dif- ferences between pre-positioning the ATD statically verses imparting a pre-impact velocity and deceleration pulse. OCCUPANT POSTIONING OR TRACKING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT - The PIE Sled Fixture can be used both off and on the HYGE sled for occupant position development. In early development of an occupant posi- tion or tracking system, the PIE sled can be used off the HYGE sled to provide a pre-crash pulse only. With the flexibility of the PIE sled, pre-brake velocities of up to 16km/hr and 15g's can be obtained. This provides the electronics laboratory or sensor system vendor a means to conduct repetitive testing with ATD's at significant lower cost than a full HYGE sled or barrier test. Occupant positioning system components include trans- ducers or sensors and an occupant sensing module (OSM) which contains signal conditioning circuits, track- ing and control algorithms. The occupant sensing module (OSM) signals the system diagnostic module (SDM) when the occupant is within an at-risk zone which would require suppression or low stage firing of the air bag. Since the OSM data will control or alter the performance of the air bag, the complete occupant tracking system must be proven to be robust. The HYGE sled using the PIE Sled Fixture can provide numerous simulations of the pre-impact events concatenated with various crash pulses at a lower cost than full barrier tests. These com- ponents or complete tracking systems can also be included in the OOP testing and at-risk zone develop- ment with no disruption to the OOP tests. This will pro- vide additional test data at minimal cost. Occupant position and tracking data can be cross- checked with film analysis from both PIE sled tests and vehicle barrier tests. A typical output of film verses occu- pant tracking output is shown below in Figure 14. Figure 14. Occupant Tracking vs. Film Analysis Data 1005</page><page sequence="8">As shown in Figure 14, this particular tracking system ini- tially tracks the occupant's head and at approximately 0.4 meters begins to pick up the shoulders. The tracking transducers were mounted in a mid-mount air bag loca- tion. AIR BAG SUPPRESION ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING - One option of the NPRM for FMVSS 208 (2), is to automatically suppress the air bag when either a child or 5th percentile female ATD enters an at-risk zone. Figure 14 shows a hypothetical at risk zone for a 5th Per- centile passenger. Figure 1 5. Hypothetical At-Risk Zone The HYGE sled with PIE Sled Fixture can be used to develop the location of these zones in lieu of the static OOP testing discussed above. In this case, the air bag would be triggered when the occupant reached a pre- determined position within the buck on the PIE sled. This position could be measured by actuating a string potentiometer, by breaking a light curtain, by an occupant position sensor or by the occupant tracking system. Con- firmation of this position could be made by film analysis. A test series would map out one or more zones within which the ATD provided unacceptable injury values. Dis- tinct zones may be configured for each size ATD. Once derived, these at-risk zones will need to be extended to encompass the performance variability of the various system components. Some of the factors that increase the at-risk zone as derived by OOP testing include: i) the sensor sample time, ii) the crash sensor time to fire, iii) normal seating position, iv) type of real world crash, v) environmental conditions, vi) sensing tol- erances, and viii) variability of the restraint and control hardware components. Unlike the standard OOP test, the HYGE with PIE Sled Fixture can simulate not only the OOP condition but also investigate the interaction of these factors. For example, the variability of the time to sense the crash and fire the air bag can be studied and upper and lower bounds established for a particular at risk zone. It the crash sen- sor could not meet these performance specifications con- sistently, the at-risk zone would need to be increased. As a development tool, the PIE sled is superior to the head form test procedure suggested by the NPRM (2). The HYGE with PIE Sled Fixture uses ATD's exposed to both the pre-impact event velocity of 1 1 km/hr and the var- ious concatenated crash pulses. The system is tracking a dummy rather than a head form, making real time deci- sions that can be evaluated via ATD injury numbers. The head form test simply monitors the tracking system and occupant sensing control module. It answers the question; does the air bag suppress if the head form enters the suppression zone? Where as, the PIE Sled Fixture enables the complete restraint systems including restraint hardware, the occupant tracking system, system diagnostic module and restraint hardware to be tested in one controlled test. DYNAMIC TRACKING SYSTEM TESTING - Another option of meeting the NPRM for FMVSS 208 (2) is to dynami- cally track the occupant and adjust an adaptive restraint system to produce injury numbers which are below the requirements set by the standard. This testing would be performed in a full vehicle barrier test, which includes a pre-impact braking event. For development purposes, the PIE sled should provide a more consistent and repeatable test method than a full barrier test. It certainly would provide more testing in a shorter period of time and at lower cost. This is especially critical with the number of OOP ATD's and OOP positions required. By utilizing the sled fixture, the entire vehicle interior can be filmed from boom mounted cameras. In barrier testing the doors must be left installed which obscures the side views. When testing for OOP children, the ATD's dynamics would not be visible in the side views. This would preclude cross checking on-board instrumentation with video analysis. For those systems, which include both dynamic tracking and suppression to control the advance adaptive restraint systems, one test fixture can be used to evaluate the sys- tem performance with various dummies undergoing dif- ferent pre-impact events and crashes. CONCLUSION Results from the initial test series conducted on the HYGE using the Pre-lmpact Event (PIE) Sled Fixture are encouraging. Improvement efforts will continue to refine the test methodology, procedures and sled fixture to achieve higher confidence of the test repeatability and correlation to real-world pre-impact events. These efforts will include: • Additional refinement of the procedures and hard- ware for the HYGE sled. • Round-robin test series on three HYGE sleds. 1006</page><page sequence="9">• Development and performance analysis of the PIE Sled Fixture on two Shenk Sleds. • Computer and sled test simulation of various pre- impact events and sensor evaluation tests. These simulations will be compared to data and video of pre-brake dynamics, dynamic OOP barrier and sen- sor barrier tests. In its current state, the PIE Sled Fixture is a valuable tool to investigate the response of current and advance restraint systems on the OOP occupant. It should be noted that for purposes of developing an advanced restraint system the PIE sled pulse is more severe. The occupant achieves higher velocities and would require an occupant sensing system to update at a higher rate to give true position. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to acknowledge H.
