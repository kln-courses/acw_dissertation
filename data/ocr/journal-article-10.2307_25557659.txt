<plain_text><page sequence="1">sleeping with Hie m Collecting and Ireland Luke Dodd argues that understanding of the past comes only from modes of display which provoke critical thinking about the issue of representation itself Many of the same objects which fed the collecting mania of the 17th and 18th century ruling classes were transformed in the 19th century, transferred to public ownership, made av ailable to the general public, and classified. Museums came into being. The great priv ate collections of fine art, archeology, pure and natural science, came to serve a new function; the instruction and edification of the general public. Although the establishment of national collections was directly initiated and fostered by ascendancy culture, the resul tant institutions, and indeed the subse quent museum tradition which was spawn ed, is not a homogeneous entity represen ting one community of interests or a uniform agenda. The word 'museum' no longer denotes the monolithic mid-19th century national collection full of impor tant, and often rare and priceless artefacts. It also includes ethnographic collections, museums of folk-history, museums of popular culture, toy collections, museums dealing with political history, etc., as well as the wave of theme-parks, and heritage and interpretative centres of the last fifty years. Obviously, the way in which a mus eum functions is heavily dependent on its particular collection ? a picture gallery and a museum devoted to labour history oper ate very differently ? but museums are also conditioned by other outside factors such as public or private ownership and funding, and whether or not the museum is a national or regional one. The character and function of a museum is also greatly dependent on the country in which it is established and the particular history of that country. It is no coincidence that coun tries with the greatest tradition of colonial expansion are also the countries with the greatest private collections, and, by default, with the best and longest museum tradi tion. Some of the world's finest museums (the Louvre, or the British Museum) are themselves monuments to imperialist plun der. On the other hand, the great Am erican collections formed at the beginning of this century, and were based largely on bequests from prominent business families. What then of the Irish experience, a coun try with a strong 19th century museum tradition largely the result of its status as a colonised country? Let me indulge in a few more generalised comments about museum practice before dealing specifically with Ireland. There is really very little to be said about 'museums' in a general sense which will not exclude at least a portion of what we now include in the scope of the term. Perhaps all that can really be said is that museums function as an expression of how a particular culture or people view themselves or, more particularly, would like to be viewed. Museums are the public face of a culture and operate like an interna 28</page><page sequence="2">tional currency in the ever-increasing global heritage industry. Museum practice does, by its very nature, involve one fundamental factor. A museum, whether it is a picture gallery, an archeological display, or a folk-park, is in volved in the re-presentation of the past through the display of objects from earlier periods. To view an object in a museum is a very different experience to viewing it in relation to the original environment for which it was intended. Museums are, generally speaking, made up of manufac tured objects (or ideas) produced at a par ticular time by a culture to function in a specific way. Once this set of particulars no longer applies the leaning' of the object is fundamentally changed. Museum curat ors have tended to ignore this fact because they operate under a pair of misconcep tions. Objects do not have an intrinsic meaning which transcends history and context, and a museum is not a neutral space which allows this Intrinsic' meaning to be displayed. A visit to a museum is a highly mediated experience in which the 'past' is used as a catalyst ? museum displays tell us as much about our attitude to the past as they do about any particular period in the past. Over the past number of decades debates within the discipline of history have given rise to debates about museum prac tice. Like traditional history, museums tend to dwell on a 'master narrative' which necessarily excludes the marginal and the local. By excluding minority and marginal history, museums present a seamless, un problematic view of the world. Museums tend to sanitise the past. Because of the relatively recent extension of the social range of museums they can no longer be said to promote only ruling class values. However, the methods traditionally used by museums to display objects have not fundamentally changed despite the exten sion of subject-matter. In this way represen tational modes are often employed which are fundamentally inappropriate to the subject being presented. Museums favour written sources over oral or folk culture. It is fair to say that folk-parks tend to present an idealised, picturesque view of the past which has much more in common with a theatrical presentation than with the lives of those people it purports to represent. Folk-parks seldom deal with death, sanita tion, starvation, disease, etc. even though great claims to authenticity are made because of the moral authority of using real objects. The 'theme-park' approach, using a mixture of reconstruction, genuine artefacts, and actors is the logical exten sion of traditional museum display which combines an artefact and a label. Both position the viewer/visitor in a specific rela tion to what is being presented. Potential ly at least, there is a far greater level of in teraction between viewer and exhibit in a theme-park but this demands far more than dressing models in period costume and showing them making butter. Museums, like educational institutions, have been slow to respond to the influence Museum displays tell us as much about our attitude to the past as they do about any particular period in the past ?P^*^j^^^^^^^P^^^;; ' ,^^^^^^^^P,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^BB||^^*:-' ^pr ^Km^mmmmmm^ 'wr^^^ll^^^^m^^^^^^'^yi&amp;- ''- &amp;VAVf' 7'^f^-^^f$P^^^^^?^M^^^'^m^m7- t^m^m^m&amp;S&amp;i \ Tho rostorod ancestral homo of Ulysoos S Grant, Co Tyrone. (Northern Ireland Tourist Board) of other disciplines and developments which would greatly enrich their own. One of the side products of this lethargy is the boring and lifeless reputation now synony mous with the traditional museum display. The great profusion in use of audio visual technology in the last 20 years is often lit tle more than a glamorous sop to a public which is visually orientated but easily bored. Museums should be taking stock of developments in film practice and theory, the visual arts, television, debates about the writing of history, and indeed any area of study which deals with the issue of repr esentation in its broadest sense. Ireland, in particular, could benefit greatly from, and indeed is ripe for, such a development because so many of our institutions (in cluding our museums) are still informed completely by our colonial past and post colonial frame of mind. Up to about twenty years ago, the Na tional Museum in Dublin had remained relatively unchanged since it was establish ed in its present building in 1877. The layout of the displays reflected the underly ing 19th century preoccupation with in struction and education. A walk through the building would very quickly bring one into contact with displays of silver, glassware, Irish antiquities, a room com memorating the 1916 Rising, a collection of dolls, Viking artefacts, ceramics, etc. The diversity of the collection and the limited exhibition space worked together to pro duce a concentrated, lively display in which wonderful juxtapositions of unrelated ob jects mimicked the very diversity of history and all of its contradictions. Although chronic underfunding has consistently dogged all of our national in stitutions it is interesting to look at the Na tional Museum to see how its limited resources have focused the change in func tion which it has gone through in recent years. The National Museum, in an at tempt to create an international profile, has emphasised the most glamorous part of its 29</page><page sequence="3">bT^^B^^RR^HMRIHIS obbbBJIIp 'BBBbBBHBoVlS^k.^^ -rr--""""i}t| | fP ^e^SSSmfmfttmlmm^^^Lm mPMRv Fl The National Museum of Ireland. (Courtesy of The National Museum.) A heritage industry dependent on its revenue earning capacity will result in a sort of censorship collection, antiquities from the Early Chris tian period. At least two major exhibitions of work from this period have travelled abroad in recent years and a special Trea sury has been created within the museum along the lines of the treasuries of the great European cathedrals to display the collec tion. The Treasury includes an audio-visual display which is itself as sophisticated as the display of the objects. There seems to be a minimum of intervention ? simple glass cases, unobtrusive overhead lighting, and simple labels. I have heard the display compared to that of a 'Bond Street Jewel ler', and it certainly does work to produce an aura of pricelessness and preciousness. These exotic, finely worked objects are coded messages from the past. Their pre sent method of display in the museum prevents the elaboration of certain discourses (about their manufacture, use, restoration, for example) and gives pro minence to others (their pricelessness, in ternational importance). There is also a distinct, if implicit, jingoism implied by the Treasury ? a display of the elaborate and sophisticated artefacts of pre-colonised Ireland, when we were still an 'island of saints and scholars'. The National Museum, because of the diversity and richness of its holdings, could benefit from a large dose of inter disciplinarianism. The museum cannot, and should not, attempt to function as it once did, but it could perform a national ly important educational role if the wealth of the collections were exploited. At the recent Maori exhibition in the Na tional Museum (Te Ao Maori), images of Maoris as wild savages attacking colonial settlers were displayed as valid represen tations of that culture alongside actual artefacts from the culture. It is quite frightening to see images, used to justify and legitimate colonial expansion by he coloniser, displayed quite unproblematical ly as actual documentary evidence of the colonised culture given the debates about colonisation which have now raged for some decades. It was a bit like using im ages from the satirical magazine Punch as ethnographic information on the 19th cen tury Irish. However, is this any worse than the representation of peasant culture which places like Bunratty and Cultra give us? Both refer to a tradition of the representa tion of subordinate classes which sentimen talises and idealises, which makes safe. In the case of Bunratty it could be said that it also refers to an Irish stereotype popularised by Hollywood cinema and, in particular, films such as The Quiet Man. The last decade has seen unprecedent ed growth in the Irish heritage industry and this is presently accelerating greatly as we prepare for the Single European Market in 1992. Almost every County now has a museum, heritage, or interpretative cen tre dealing with local history, archeological remains, or offering a genealogical re search service for those with Irish roots. Ireland was relatively slow to respond to the exploitation of its heritage potential. When work did get underway the methods and procedures adopted were, for the most part, those developed in England and North America without regard to any speci fic requirements from which an Irish model might benefit. In fact, many of the displays and audio-visual presentations are specific ally tailored for a foreign market, the inter national visitor. Because of this, recent heritage developments in Ireland are as heavily mortgaged to dominant culture as were the museums developed in Ireland in the 19th century when we were still part of the Empire. The great educational ideal ism of the 19th century (even though this centred on the propagation of ruling class notions of how the world was and should be) has been obscured to a large degree. The heritage industry has now become big business. This will result in a sort of cen sorship. A heritage industry wholly depen dent on its revenue-earning capacity for survival will mean that certain issues and periods will not receive any attention because they might be viewed as conten tious or unpalatable or of minority interest. Look at the fiasco which took place with the commemoration for the 1916 Rising only this year. Why has Ireland no mus eum commemorating Irish women's hist ory, a museum of the colonised, a mus eum of rebellion and/or nationalism, a museum for the Famine of the 1840s, the single most important event in Ireland's re cent history? Why have the folk-life hold ings of the National Museum always been in storage? Why is there even a discussion concerning the development of Carton Desmesne at Maynooth as a leisure com plex, the best single monument to ascen dancy culture to survive relatively intact in the country? Some museums are being developed like the writer's museum in Dublin but Joyce, Yeats, and Co. are now big business. How many living writers will be included? The new Irish Museum of Modern Art is a more complicated exam ple. It was directly fostered by the Taoiseach, Mr Haughey, who has a great desire to be seen to be associated with the Arts and in particular with the (often dubious) progressiveness represented by the modernist tradition in 20th century art practice. Of course, Ireland should have a facility for contemporary art but should this not be more of an institute rather than a museum given the impossibly vast outlay in purchasing a representative collection? The conversion of a large section of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham for the museum is also a disgrace as it un necessarily radically altered the specific character of the most important 17th cen tury building in the country. 30</page><page sequence="4">In conclusion, I would like to talk brief ly about two long established Irish museums which might shed some light on the museum experience in general in Ireland ? The Natural History Museum and the Zoo. The former, housed in its own building on Merrion Street since 1856, is a division of the National Museum. It must be one of the last major European collec tions to remain virtually untouched since it was founded in the mid-19th century. Although the primary function of the museum has always been discussed in terms of its importance for research, it is also a rich expression of the various con scious and unconscious preoccupations and beliefs which inform the origin of museums in general. The only reason for lack of change has been the chronic shor tage of funding for the National Museum and not a willingness to preserve intact a perfect example of a 19th century museum environment. With a minimum of interven tion the Dublin Natural History Museum could provide the perfect expression of the museum as museum. It could be used to comment on itself and its implications us ing an endless variety of topics as diverse as 19th century preoccupations with death, teleological world views, Darwin's theories on the evolution of species, game hunting, taxidermy, anthropomorphism etc, etc. In this way, the museum would continue to perform its primary function but at the same time the richness of the collection could be exploited in terms of modern day concerns. The impetus behind the establishment of National Zoological Collections is the same as that which informed the establish ment of collections of inanimate objects. Zoos were established with the same prin cipled idealism except that live animals were the subject of display. London Zoo is to close and a debate about the future of that in Dublin is also underway. There is really no justification for removing animals from their natural habitat so that they function as completely decontextualis ed displays. The resources needed to maintain endangered species in captivity should be redirected into preserved habitats in the wild. Dublin Zoo need not close but it could become a valuable educational resource by concerning itself with indiginous Irish wildlife and domestic animals. Museums are really not different from any other man-made institutions and should be able to adapt to changed and changing circumstances. However, in the case of museums this has to involve more than using new technologies to display artefacts in a traditional way. Museums are our society's most tangible link with the past and an understanding of the past has always been fundamental to any under standing of our own societies. This under standing will not come from glamorisation or techno-fetishism alone, but from modes of presentation which provoke critical thinking about the past.
