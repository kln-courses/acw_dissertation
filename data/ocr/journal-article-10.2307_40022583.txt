Printed in the Netherlands. University of Toronto, Canada 'I have found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith' (Immanuel Kant)1 In the opening paragraphs of Section 57 of the Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics 'On the determination of the bounds of pure reason', Kant makes reference to Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion as an illustra- tion of what might result if 'we conceded no things in themselves or set up our experience for the only possible mode of knowing things . . . [which would] have the principles of the possibility of experience considered universal con- ditions of things in themselves',2 Regarding the way possible experience is conditioned as the way things in themselves are conditioned (making the principles of possible experience transcendent) results in skepticism: every- thing that transcends experience is worthless as it is unknowable. Just as he sought to relieve the skepticism that he saw resulting from Hume's analysis of causality, so too in §57 ff. Kant seeks to relieve the skepticism with respect to the knowability of the Supreme Being that he perceives in Hume's work. Kant suggests that noumena, as that which are presupposed in all possible experience and through which reason achieves the satisfaction and complete- ness not available in phenomena, are found in the void, beyond all experience. He then asks 'What is the attitude of our reason in this connection of what we know with what we do not, and never shall, know?' (P: §57, 113) How does reason approach the unknown and unknowable world of noumena when reason is applicable only to the known and knowable world of phenomena? In this and the following sections, Kant intends to show how a connection is possible between these two worlds, 'by means of such concepts as express their relation to the world of sense', and he will use the notion of the Supreme Being as an example, as a concept that may be thought, if not known. In this paper I will address the arguments that Kant uses to show the way in which we can think but not know the Deity, and how Kant thinks his</page><page sequence="2">134 BERYL LOGAN arguments combat the skepticism that he finds in Hume's arguments in the Dialogues. Kant's reading of the Dialogues as negative and skeptical is in accord with that generally adopted in the Hume literature, but by offering my own account of the belief that is expressed in the Dialogues I show that for Hume as well, the Deity is ultimately unknowable as it is not an item of knowledge. However, Kant's means of relieving this ignorance is quite unHumean, as Hume's means is quite unKantian. Kant would appear to have had a more substantial acquaintance with Hume's Dialogues than with Hume's other texts. A German edition of the Dialogues was published in 1781, two years after the initial publication of the Dialogues in English. In addition to referring to Hume's arguments in the Prolegomena, Kant's knowledge of this text is clearly evident in his Lectures on Philosophical Theology.3 He refers there to objections raised by Hume against inferring that an intelligence is responsible for purposiveness in nature (what Kant calls the 'physicotheological proof, 'which makes use of expe- rience of the present world in general and infers from this to the existence of an author of the world and to the attributes which would belong to its author as such').4 I Kant begins Section 57 of the Prolegomena, 'On the determination of the bounds of pure reason', by opposing two absurdities, or contradictions. The first has two parts: first, it would be contradictory to think that we can know anything more about an object than belongs to the possible experience of it. That is, we can only have experience of objects through the forms of intuition of space and time, and we can only know them as phenomena, as they appear to us as objects of sensory experience. We can never know any object independent of or outside of space and time, or as something other than a sensory experience. Then, of course, we can have no knowledge of how any object that is outside of space and time and sensory experience can be - or whether or not it is - determined by its own nature in the way that the objects of sensory experience are determined by the a priori principles. This sets the boundaries of our knowledge, but objects are not limited by the ways in which we are able to know them. 'Bounds . . . always presuppose a space existing outside a certain definite place and enclosing it; limits do not require this, but are mere negations, which affect a quantity, so far as it is not absolutely complete' (P: §57, 111). Completeness, things in themselves, lie beyond the boundary. The second contradiction occurs when reason regards our way of knowing things as being the only way of knowing. The objects of possible experience</page><page sequence="3">HUME AND MANT ON KNOWING THE DEITY 1 35 must be intuited in space and time; as conditioned, they are limited to being experienced in these ways. This is a contradiction, because things in them- selves or noumena, which must exist for it to be possible to have experience of phenomena, would no longer be things in themselves but would be objects of possible experience. It would be contradictory to regard things in them- selves as objects of reason (the role of reason being to apply the 'synthesis of representation' to its objects). And, it would be presumptuous of us to declare that the means by which empirical objects are known - intuited in space and time conditioned by the principles of possible experience - is the only way any things, including things in themselves, can be known. Unless reason is the object of 'a careful critique' (P: 110) (an examination of the objects and limits of reason), it may transcend the empirical use of the concepts - go beyond that to which they are by nature applicable - and attempt to similarly limit things in themselves, i.e., 'know' them as objects of experience.5 The principles or conditioning concepts are valid only as they are applied to the undistinguished manifold of perceptions, and the limits of reason lie in its application of just these principles to just this manifold of perceptions. The limits inherent in the principles and our reason (valid only as applied to possible experience) must not be taken to indicate the limits of things in themselves, which would make them unknowable because they cannot be known by our way of knowing. Things in themselves are not objects of possible experience, and thus are not knowable by the means that such objects are known. If this means is regarded as the only way of 'knowing' then these objects are unknowable. It is the claim that there is only one way of knowing which Kant is concerned with. And Kant regards Hume's Dialogues to be an example or illustration of this contradiction: 'Our principles, which limit the use of reason to possible experience, might in this way become transcendent, and the limits of our reason be set up as limits of the possibility of things in themselves (as Hume's Dialogues may illustrate) ' (P: §57, 1 10) I will now show why Kant regards the arguments of the Dialogues to be an illustration of his point, and how he combats the perceived skepticism of the Dialogues. In this section I will adopt Kant's view of the Dialogues, that Hume takes only a critical position, and draws only a skeptical conclusion. II In the Dialogues, Cleanthes presents the anthropomorphic Argument from Design that draws analogical inferences regarding the nature of the Deity from what is found in experience. He argues that the intelligence and benevolence of the Deity, the cause, can be inferred from what we find in the world, the effect. This position assumes that reason can achieve results in natural</page><page sequence="4">136 BERYL LOGAN theology by using the same methods that it would apply to an empirical investigation. For example, I can infer by an analogical argument that if I buy a new car that is similar to my old car, and if I know from experience that my old car uses x litres to drive y kilometers, then my new car will do the same. In the same way, Cleanthes says, I can infer by an analogical argument that as we know from experience that a machine or human artifact that has certain features was designed by a being with intelligence, that the world, which has similar features, was also designed by a being with intelligence. As the effects resemble, the causes also resemble, in proportion to the complexity, or 'grandeur', of their effects: as the universe, the effect, is vastly greater and more complex than a computer or a sewing machine, their designers, or causes, are proportionately different only in greatness - a difference of degree, not kind. The thrust of Philo's (Hume's) criticisms of the Design Argument is that nothing can be inferred about the nature of the cause, the Deity, by examining the effect, the world. Philo shows Cleanthes that the methods he is using are applicable only to empirical investigation, and not to objects that lie beyond the limits of human experience.6 So long as we confine our speculations to trade, or morals, or politics, or criticism, we make appeals, every moment to common sense and experi- ence, which strengthen our philosophical conclusions and remove (at least in part) the suspicion, which we so justly entertain with regard to every reasoning, that is very subtile and refine. But in theological reasonings, we have not this advantage; while at the same time we are employed upon objects which, we must be sensible, are too large for our grasp We are like foreigners in a strange country to whom everything must seem suspicious, and who are in danger every moment of transgressing against the laws and customs of the people with whom they live and converse. We know not how far we ought to trust our vulgar methods of reasoning in such a subject (D: 101) As a result of the inability of the experimental, or empirical, method of reasoning, i.e., making general inferences drawn from the data of experience, to 'know' anything about what is not an object of sense experience, no determinate conclusion with respect to the Deity's intelligence, benevolence, or mode of existence may be drawn. This position is an illustration of Kant's point in the following way. Kant had stated that a contradiction results if reason, the means by which we know sensible objects, applies itself to objects beyond its proper application (i.e., to sensible objects only) to objects that are not sensible, and proceeds to claim that as such means cannot know these objects, the objects cannot be known. This regards the way of knowing</page><page sequence="5">HUME AND MANT ON KNOWING THE DEITY 1 37 sensible objects to be the only way of knowing at all. So, if Hume concludes that the experimental method fails with respect to the Deity because the Deity is not part of the data of experience, this leaves him with only one position in natural theology - that of skepticism. No other way of knowing, in any sense, is available. As the appropriate way of applying the experimental method to the Deity is by analogy from what is known, and since what is known is the human world of sense and experience, then any claims about the Deity must be anthropomorphic. Kant argues that for Hume theism and anthropomorphism are inseparable, such that if anthropomorphism falls so does theism. As Hume's arguments in the Dialogues devastate anthropomorphism, theism vanishes. Kant thus proposes a third way, one that preserves theism and combats Hume's skepticism by proposing a non-anthropomorphic analogical argument through which we may think the Deity. The series of arguments in sections 57, 58 and 59 leads to this proposal. Kant brings the contradictions from earlier paragraphs of §57 to bear on 'the concept of the highest being'. Natural theology leads reason to the 'objec- tive boundary of experience' - on our side of the boundary is the world of phenomena, of appearances, of experience. At that boundary, reason connects experience with that which lies beyond that boundary, in the world of things in themselves, which are not objects of experience but which are the grounds or conditions of experience. Hume is left on our side of the boundary, limited to experience alone, unable to make the connections with what would give perceptions an objective ground. He is thus left with skepticism with respect to anything beyond perceptions. Natural theology is ... a concept on the boundary of human reason, being constrained to look beyond this boundary to the idea of a Supreme Being (and, for practical purposes, to that of an intelligible world also), not in order to determine anything relatively to this pure creation of the understanding, which lies beyond the world of sense, but in order to guide the use of reason within it according to principles of the greatest possible (theoretical as well as practical) unity. For this purpose we make use of the reference of the world of sense to an independent reason, as the cause of all its connections. Thereby we do not purely invent a being, but, as beyond the sensible world there must be something that can only be thought by the pure understanding, we determine that something in this particular way, though only of course according to analogy. (P: §59, 118-119)</page><page sequence="6">138 BERYL LOGAN This quote alludes to a distinction drawn by Kant in the 'Preface to the Second Edition' of the CPR between thinking an object and knowing an object.7 He states there that while 'we cannot know these objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in a position at least to think them as things in themselves'. Without being able to think of things in themselves as things in themselves, i.e., that there are things in themselves, 'we should be landed in the absurd conclusion that there can be appearances [phenomena] without anything that appears [noumena]\ In a footnote, Kant explicates this distinction: 'To know an object I must be able to prove its possibility, either from its actuality as attested by experience, or a priori by means of reason. But I can think whatever I please, provided ... my concept is a possible thought'. (That is, it contains no contradictions.) Thinking an object 'does not answer for there being ... an object corresponding to iV(CPR B xxvii). To know an object is to determine or condition it, i.e., to know the conditions under which it is an object of possible experience, or to know the concepts under which it is subsumed. (As the contradictions discussed earlier show, though, such knowledge of things in themselves is not possible as they are not able to be either determined or conditioned.) While we think the possibility of such a Being, we are not 'merely inventing' it,8 as it would be absurd to claim that there are connections in the world of the senses without there being a cause of those connections. So we look 'beyond the boundary' of what we can know (the objects of possible experience), to think the idea of a Supreme Being, but anything we may say about that Being can only be accomplished by analogy. According to Philo's critical arguments, neither reason nor experience can achieve anything that is useful for religion. According to Kant, though, while reason is limited to objects of possible experience, its limits are only bound- aries beyond which lie things in themselves. Kant thinks he can save theism by pushing possible experience to the boundary and making a 'connection' between possible experience and the Deity as a thing in itself. The analogy that he proposes does not depend upon the similarities of objects being compared. Rather, Kant employs what he calls 'symbolic anthropomorphism', which 'concerns language only and not the object itself (P: §57, 1 15). It is a way of thinking and talking about the Deity that reflects the relationship between the sensible world and the Deity without purporting to describe the Deity. As a thing-in-itself, the Deity is unknowable. It is the point of connection between the worlds of phenomena and noumena. This symbolic anthropomorphism is established by an analogical argument that is relational rather than descriptive, i.e., it intends to establish similar relations between items, not to describe the items. It does not allow us to have knowledge of a thing-in-itself, something which Kant believes we are unable to do, but it does allow us to think and talk about the Deity through terms and</page><page sequence="7">HUME AND MANT ON KNOWING THE DEITY 1 39 relations that are within the scope of our knowledge; we are describing what our experience is like for us and speaking about God in those terms that are knowable by us. When we speak of, and reason about, God in these terms, we are not describing what God is like nor are we drawing any conclusions about God as God as a thing-in-itself. God as a thing-in-itself is unknowable as a thing in itself. Further, this analogy does not mean, as is commonly understood, 'an imper- fect similarity of two things, but a perfect similarity of relations between two quite dissimilar things' (P: §58, 115). 'Dogmatic anthropomorphism', such as that employed by Cleanthes in the Dialogues, attributes to the highest being in itself those properties through which we think objects of experience. A standard analogical argument infers a missing feature on the basis of the similarity of the items being compared. Car X has features (a) standard transmission, (b) V-6 engine, and (c) for every litre of gasoline, it travels 20 kilometers. If Car Y has features (a) and (b),then we can infer that it will also have feature (c). The two cars being compared exhibit relevantly similar features, and on the basis of this relevant similarity a conclusion may be drawn with respect to the missing feature. The two items being compared are placed in that comparison on the basis of their similarity, and the conclusion draws its strength from the degree (and relevance) of that similarity. There is a justification, based on similarity, for placing these two items in the relationship and inferring the presence of the missing feature. This is the form of argument utilized by Cleanthes. Kant's analogical argument, on the other hand, is not based on similarity of features of the items compared, but on their relationships: '. . . I can obtain a relational concept of things which are absolutely unknown to me. For instance, as the promotion of the welfare of children (= a) is to the love of parents (= b), so the welfare of the human species (= c) is to that unknown in God (= x), which we call love . . . ' (P: §58, 1 15-116). Making this relational claim does not infer that the Deity is or is not intelligent, or if it is intelligent that the Deity's intelligence is anything like human intelligence. It only 'determine^] it as regards the [sensible] world and therefore as regards ourselves'. When we speak of the world as being intelligently ordered, we say much about ourselves in the world of phenomena when we speak of God being in a relation (one we can understand) to us like the relation of parent and child, but we say nothing of God. The 'predicates' that we attribute to God in this way are thus determined subjectively - for us and by us. They are not determined objectively - this is what God is like - as is the case in the 'standard' argument. If I say that we are compelled to consider the world as if it were the work of a Supreme Understanding and Will, I really say nothing more than that as</page><page sequence="8">140 BERYL LOGAN a watch, a ship, a regiment bears the same relation to the watchmaker, the shipbuilder, the commanding officer as the world of sense (or whatever constitutes the substratum of this complex of appearances) does to the Unknown, which I do not hereby cognize as it is in itself, but as it is for me or in relation to the world of which I am a part. (P: §57, 115) This, according to Kant, saves theism by freeing it from its dependence upon anthropomorphism, as it is not an anthropomorphic analogy. It makes no claim, as Cleanthes' argument does, as to what are the nature or features of the Deity, and whether they in any way resemble those of humans. This kind of 'reasoning' about God, in the face of our inability to know things-in-themselves is confined to the reasoning we are entitled to undertake: the Deity's features and existence is not directly knowable as 'our conscious- ness of all existence . . . belongs exclusively to the unity of experience . . . any existence outside this field, while not indeed such as we can declare to be absolutely impossible, is of the nature of an assumption which we can never be in a position to justify' (CPR: 506). Any reasoning about religious matters can and must take place only within the realm of sensous experience. The analogy that we are entitled to employ - i.e. one that makes reference only to our experience and what humans are like and not what God is like - can, however, make no anthropomorphic claims, 'as the concept of God must be carefully purified and freed of all such human ideas; from a practical point of view, though, we may momentarily represent God using such predicates whenever by this means the thought of God affords more power and strength . . . ' ,9 Thus our reasoning about God (and religious matters) is confined to our reasoning about any other matter: it can only refer to the world of experience. Through the 'symbolic anthropomorphism' we indulge in this practical rep- resentation to speak of God as we speak of humans, that God loves humans in the way that a parent loves her child. But this reasoning is not knowing God as a thing-in-itself - something we cannot do - it is rather reasoning about our world and experience, and when we speak about God we (can only) speak in these terms. The unknowability of things-in-themselves precludes us from supposing, or reasoning, that how we speak and think about God is saying something about what God is like. Religion (as 'the recognition of all duties as divine commands'10) is still, however, within the limits of reason. Reason's recourse to the objects of sense establishes the relation in the analogy as it applies to sensible objects, i.e. parental love for children. But this analogy only serves to make perceptual, in the interests of practicality, what is 'invisible': 'But we cannot know anything at all about supernatural aid - whether a certain moral power, perceptible to us, really comes from above or, indeed, on what occasions and under what conditions it may be expected'.12</page><page sequence="9">HUME AND MANT ON KNOWING THE DEITY 1 41 Religion must remain within the limits of reason, as applicable to and referring to, only the objects of experience. We approach the limits of this reasoning when we refer to God, as a concept lying beyond the boundary between phenomena (benevolence, intelligence, etc. as they apply to humans) and noumena (God as thing-in-itself) through the symbolic anthropomorphic analogy. But reason would be going beyond its limits if it thought it could apply these phenomena to God to say what God is like. God is not directly knowable, and is not related to the world or its inhabitants in any vital way; the anthropomorphic representation of God and God's being, is 'harmless enough (so long as it does not influence concepts of duty)'.12 But what can be known, and what is within reason's limits, is the recognition of our duties and the laws. The representation of God through the relational, symbolically anthropomorphic analogy, plays a practical role in making 'visible' what is invisible. In the next part of this paper, I return to Philo's claims in the Dialogues to show that he too expresses a non-anthropomorphic belief in a Deity, and that his role is more than just that of critic. Ill The purpose of the Dialogues, as stated by Pamphilus in the Introduction, is not to establish the Deity's existence, which is self-evident, but only to address the issue of the Deity's nature. Cleanthes claims to 'know' the Deity by inference from the data in the world, while Demea (and Philo) maintain that the Deity is 'mystedously adorable'. According to Cleanthes' arguments, the orderliness and purposiveness of the world allow us to infer that the Designer of the world has an intelligence that is like the intelligence of the designers of orderly and purposive objects (machines or human artifacts) in the world. In Parts 4 to 8, Philo shows that the claim that the designer of the world is intelligent like humans are intelligent is only one of a number of hypotheses that are possible when inferring from the data in the world, including the conjecture that there is more than one designer, and that an anthropomorphic Deity is not like a Deity at all.13 In Part 9, Cleanthes shows, in answering Demea's a priori argument, that the necessity of the Deity's existence cannot be established. In Parts 10 and 11, he shows that the data or evidence in the world permit only the inference that the Deity is not benevolent and/or malevolent, but is indifferent. In Part 12, Philo sums up these claims by stating that while there is some analogy between the effects (human artifacts and the world) and the causes (humans and the Deity) it is very remote one. All that results from an argument like Cleanthes' is the claim that 'the cause or causes of order in the universe</page><page sequence="10">142 BERYL LOGAN probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence', but alleges that the argument is too weak to provide any basis for religious belief. It warrants only 'philosophical assent' to its 'legitimate' conclusion, as the argument outweighs the objections. While earlier in Part 12 Philo had stated 'That the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of art is evident No man can deny the analogies between the effects: To restrain ourselves from enquiring concerning the causes is scarcely possible: From this enquiry, the legitimate conclusion is, that the causes also have an analogy . . . \ this is, I submit, Philo admitting simply that there is some analogy, and that it is reasonable to draw the conclusion. The weakest analogy is still a legitimate inference: if I infer from the fact that one pair of size 8^ shoes fits that all other size 8| shoes will lit, I am drawing an analogical inference, even though it may be a very weak one because I am inferring from one case to many cases. The issue is whether or not this constitutes Philo's expression of belief, and I would urge that it does not.14 It is merely what Philo refers to in the penultimate paragraph of Part 12 as the 'plain philosophical assent' that the inquisitive person would give to the proposition 'as often as it occurs' and the only belief that arises from this assent is the belief 'that the arguments, on which it is established, exceed the objections, which lie against it . . . '. In Part 5, Philo tells Cleanthes that one 'who follows your hypothesis, is able, perhaps, to assert, or conjecture, that the universe, some time, arose from something like design: But beyond that position he cannot ascertain one single circumstance . . . ' (D: 131). Philo claims in Part 2 of the Dialogues that while we can use words to describe the Deity, such as intelligent, wise, benevolent, we should not think that the words we use actually do refer to or accurately describe the characteristics or features of the Deity: ... we ought never to image that we comprehend the attributes of this divine Being, or to suppose that his perfections have any analogy or like- ness to the perfections of a human creature. Wisdom, thought, design, knowledge - these we justly ascribe to him because these words are hon- ourable among men, and we have no other language or other conceptions by which we can express our adoration of him. But let us beware lest we think that our ideas anywise correspond to his perfections, or that his attributes have any resemblance to these qualities among men. (D: 108) In sum, in spite of arguments to establish the Deity's nature, reason cannot in the end determine anything about the Deity's nature. We cannot say that a human-like intelligence is the cause of the world, that this cause is benevolent, or that its existence is necessary. It is not possible to establish conclusively anything about a God 'who [does] not discover himself immediately to our senses'. We may use the words 'intelligent', 'benevolent', 'necessary', but</page><page sequence="11">HUME AND M ANT ON KNOWING THE DEITY 1 43 we cannot claim that they accurately describe the Deity. Hume's position is, then, that we cannot 'know' the Deity, i.e., grasp the Deity's nature, by utilizing the experimental method. This critical stance is not, however, Hume's final word in the Dialogues. It may, though, be the final suspense of judgement one faces when one applies reason to issues of natural theology. It is my position that Philo (and Hume) presents a positive statement of belief, and for this belief the Deity is likewise unknowable. Throughout the Dialogues, Philo has taken a consistent position: while Cleanthes had maintained that the Design Argument constituted 'proof of the Deity's existence and the Deity's similarity to humans (thus allowing the Deity to be comprehensible), Philo shows Cleanthes that in fact the only position tenable in natural theology is a suspense of judgement.15 This is hardly satisfactory to be religious belief, as Philo further notes: the contemplative person feels some contempt of human reason if all it can produce is such a weak argument, and 'the most natural sentiment which a well disposed mind will feel on this occasion, is a longing desire and expectation' for some resolution of this position of profound ignorance. The failure of the Design Argument to produce any definitive conclusion leads the inquisitive thinker to seek a further revelation in nature. Early in Part 12 Philo states that the 'striking appearances' in nature prevent one from doubting a supreme intelligence; that all a divine Being need do is 'copy the present economy of things; render many of his artifices so plain, that no stupidity could mistake them'; 'A purpose, an intention, a design strikes every where the most careless, the most stupid thinker; and no man can be so hardened in absurd systems, as at all times to reject it' (D: 172). That is, Philo would say: 'Look' round the world, look at the wonderful variety and exact propriety, look at the whole face of nature, how can one be so obstinate as to deny that there is a supreme intelligence'. I would argue that these claims of Philo 's are the result of an irregular argument like the one that Cleanthes utilizes in Part 3: such arguments appeal to the sentiments, to the imagination and emotions rather than to reason; they contravene accepted rules. The model for such arguments in literature is some forms of poetry. Rather than conform to accepted or established patterns of rhyme and metre, many poems in fact lack both these features. Their con- struction is meant to evoke vivid imagery and incite passions. Likewise, the irregular 'argument' in natural theology does not make a reasoned inference from the evidence (the effect) to the Deity (the cause), as does the Design Argument. (In fact, in Part 2, Philo 's initial criticisms of this argument focus on its lack of adherence to the requirements for analogical arguments, rel- evant similarity and repeated experience, and that it commits the fallacy of</page><page sequence="12">144 BERYL LOGAN composition16). Philo's irregular argument, expressed in the above passages as well as at the conclusion of the penultimate, and crucial, paragraph of Part 12,17 give rise to a belief in an intelligent designer that is not based on any inference from the evidence or effect to the cause: it is drawn, quite simply and quite irresistibly, when one is confronted with the very numerous (so many that 'no human nature can compute their number') and forcible (so that 'no understanding [can] estimate their cogency') facts in nature. The force of this argument is not drawn from the inference from effect to cause by analogy. One is struck or impressed with great force by the facts of nature, and 'cannot hesitate a moment' concerning the cause of it all.18 What is important to note for our purposes is that it makes no claim as to the nature of the Deity, that the Deity has this or that feature that is comprehensible to us because it is similar to us. We are by nature irresistibly and inextricably drawn towards the belief in a Supreme Being to which we pay "profound adoration" whenever we contemplate the complexities of nature. I will now focus the interesting similarity that has emerged from our dis- cussions of Hume and Kant on the Deity. IV We saw in a previous section that for Kant we cannot know the Deity, as knowledge requires both a concept and a sensuous intuition, and as the Deity is part of the noumenal world, such intuition is not possible. We may think about the Deity, by drawing analogies to relationships that are knowable in the phenomena world, and represent the invisible through the visible in the interests of practicality. So when we talk about certain features of the Deity, we are really only talking about what holds in the sensible world of experience, and we are not truly describing the Deity. Further, for Hume, the experimental method fails in its attempt to establish that the Deity has the features of intelligence, necessary existence, and benevolence. The Deity remains mysteriously adorable, and while we can use words such as wisdom or benevolence when we speak about the Deity, we cannot presume that these words actually describe the Deity. We may be irresistibly drawn to acknowledge a designer of the world, but we can say nothing that would claim to describe that Deity.19 Now that we have shown the arguments presented by Hume and Kant that are concerned with the knowability of the Deity, we can see the similarity in their positions. And this similarity is that, ultimately, the Deity is unknowable by reason, and that any way we may come to speak about the Deity says much about us and nothing about the Deity. For both Hume and Kant, this lack of knowledge derives from the fact that the Deity is not an object of (possible)</page><page sequence="13">HUME AND MANT ON KNOWING THE DEITY 1 45 experience, and the only way we have to refer to or speak about the Deity is by our words that are applicable only to the objects of experience. Hume's criticisms of what Kant calls 'dogmatic' anthropomorphism, and its claims as to what the Deity is indeed like, show the failure of this position. The evidence does not allow for the conclusion Cleanthes seeks, given that any number of claims as to the nature of the cause are possible, and that an anthropomorphic Deity is like no Deity at all. While the empirical method is applicable to the objects of sense experience, it is not applicable to objects beyond sense experience. As a Kantian 'thing in itself, a concept beyond the phenomenal world, the Deity is not knowable for Kant either. Any religious reasoning must remain within the limits of reason alone, so any religious reasoning must be confined to the objects of the senses. The religious reasoning that directs us to the recognition of our duties must occur absent of knowledge of God. We carry out what we know to be our duty independent of our knowing the influence of God on our morality, or whether God approves. Knowledge requires both concept and sensible intuition, and the latter is lacking in this case. So for both Kant and Hume, given the means by which knowledge is gained for each, we are left eager to seek some other way to approach the Deity. But the way that they each relieve this lack of knowledge is quite dissimilar, reflecting their substantially divergent epistemological commitments. Kant seeks to alleviate the lack of knowledge by use of a symbolic anthro- pomorphic analogy. As an object that lies beyond possible experience, no method or faculty or principle that is appropriate for inferring, grasping, or ordering sensory experience is useable. We cannot know the Deity as a thing in itself, but we can think the Deity through what we can know in the sensi- ble world, and this is done via symbolic anthropomorphism. ('I can obtain a relational concept of things which are absolutely known to me . . . ') Without knowledge of the Deity, we cannot say that the Deity is intelligent, benev- olent, loving, but we can think about the Deity as caring for us or as being intelligent through a relational analogy with what we can know about what caring and intelligence mean for us. And through the representation of God made visible through this analogy, we picture 'to ourselves our duty in the service of God, a means which, although really indispensable, is extremely liable to the danger of misconstruction; for, through an illusion that steals over us, it is easily held to be the service of God itself . . . \20 Any reasoning refers only to the world of experience, for us and by us, and not to the world of the Deity.21 Hume alleviates the lack by claiming we have an irresistible urge, or senti- ment, to acknowledge a Deity whenever we contemplate the complexity and order in nature. It is impossible, in the face of nature, to maintain a position</page><page sequence="14">146 BERYL LOGAN of skepticism with respect to the Deity. Science regards nature as being pur- posive and intentional; scientists always seek a use or purpose for a newly identified organ or canal, and they are faced with the 'wonderful variety' and 'exact propriety, suited to the different intentions of nature, in framing each species'. If even Galen 'could not withstand such striking appearances; to what pitch of pertinacious obstinacy must a philosopher in this age have attained, who can now doubt of a supreme intelligence?' (D: 173). No anthro- pomorphic claims, no analogical arguments, no inferences from experience - we are simply struck with the force of the appearance of nature: a Deity who does not present itself to the senses could do no more than 'render many of his artifices so plain, that no stupidity could mistake them'.22 Kant claims that Hume's criticisms of Cleanthes' analogical argument pre- sented in Parts 2 and 4-8 in the Dialogues do not 'touch us'. Not only do some arguments not affect Kant's claims, but this relational analogical argument provides an answer to one of the requirements for analogical arguments: that of similarity between items compared. A strong (or indeed any) analogical argument must compare similar items and any dissimilarity weakens the argu- ment. Philo claims that the world (universe) and machines are too dissimilar to permit an analogical inference of any strength. Kant's 'symbolic anthro- pomorphism' is immune to this criticism, as lack of similarity of objects is irrelevant, only similarity of relationship is relevant. Conclusion According to Kant's understanding of Hume's Dialogues, which regards it to be a critical work that devastates theism by devastating anthropomorphism, skepticism is the only position possible given Hume's arguments in the Dia- logues. Hume has substituted skepticism for dogmatism. But Kant thinks theism can be preserved by symbolic anthropomorphism which does not oblige one to attribute any particular properties to the Deity. He has replaced objective anthropomorphism (which makes claims about the nature of the Deity), with symbolic anthropomorphism (which does not). By focusing on Philo 's positive expressions of belief in the Dialogues, I would urge that a similarity exists between Kant's symbolic anthropomorphism and Philo's irresistible belief in that, for both, we do not describe what the Deity is really like, we only talk about the Deity in words that are familiar to and meaningful for us, that serve a practical purpose, and talk about what our world is like. It is about our language and our world, not about the object.</page><page sequence="15">HUME AND MANT ON KNOWING THE DEITY 1 47 Notes 1. Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans. N.K.

'For in order to arrive at [transcendent] insight [reason] must make use of principles which, in fact, extend only to objects of possible experience, and which, if also applied to what cannot be an object of experience, always really change this into an appearance, thus rendering all practical extension of pure reason impossible' (Critique of Pure Reason, Preface to Second Edition, B xxx). 6. 'Let us become thoroughly sensible of the weakness, blindness, and narrow limits of human reason: Let us duly consider its uncertainty and endless contrarieties, even in subjects of common life and practice . . . ', David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, ed. Tweyman (Routledge, 1991), p. 98. Further references to this text will be given in the body, by 'D\ followed by page number. 7. See also the following references in the CPR: 'To think an object and to know an object are thus by no means the same thing. Knowledge involves two factors: first, the concept, through which an object in general is thought (the category); and secondly, the intuition, through which it is given' (B 146); 'If I remove from empirical knowledge all thought (through categories), no knowledge of any object remains' (A254/B310). 8. While elaboration on this point is beyond the scope of this paper, some Hume commentators argue that the belief in an intelligent designer is a 'natural belief, like the beliefs in causality, the external world, and the self. In all four cases, there is no sense perception of the objects of any of these beliefs, and so they are regarded as 'fictions', although we are determined by nature to hold these beliefs. So, we are not 'merely inventing' the objects of these beliefs, as we do with some truly fictitious ideas (like civilizations on other planets or my dream house), but they are necessary to make our perceptual experiences connected and coherent. In my A Religion Without Talking: Religious Belief and Natural Belief in Hume's Philosophy of Religion (Lang, 1993), I argue that the belief in an intelligent designer is indeed a natural belief. 9.

In general, commentators regard this paragraph to constitute Philo's confession of belief, that it constitutes an 'about face' for Philo, that in spite of his criticisms the Argument from Design is all we have to ground religious belief and/or that the weakness of the analogy is an expression of Hume's atheism.

With respect to the Deity s intelligence, this position is achieved at the end of Part 8; with respect to the modality of the Deity's existence, in Part 9; and with respect to the Deity's benevolence in Part 11. The final statement of this position is found in the ambiguous, undefined proposition, 'that the cause or causes of the universe may bear some remote analogy to human intelligence'. io. inougni, uesign, intelligence, sucn as we uiscover in men anu umer anmiais, is nu inure than one of the springs and principles of the universe, as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion, and a hundred others, which fall under daily observation.

' That is, a suspense of judgement is not a possible position to maintain in natural theology, as Cleanthes and Philo agree early in Part 12; the 'well-disposed mind' (one that recognizes the order and design in nature and seeks original rather than immediate causes) seeks to alleviate this ignorance that results from the failure of reason to provide clear arguments and looks to nature (heaven) for guidance. This 'well-disposed mind' will be drawn irresistibly to acknowledge an intelligent designer in the same way that one cannot hesitate to ascribe an intelligent cause to the Articulate voice or to the living books (Part 3). i». see Humes uiawgues, ran 3. iy. ror me run arguments on wnicn tnese points reiy, see my ine irregular argument in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion', Hume Studies, November 1992, pp. 483-500; and my A Religion Without Talking. zu. ivani, Keugwn witnin me Limns oj treason mone, p. i ou. zi. in me lniroaucuon io Keugwn wunin me Limits, ureene wnies as ionows regaruing Kant's 'sense of cosmic mystery'.
