Jefferson, North Carolina/ London: McFarland/Bailey Bros. and Swinfen, 1988. ?18.70. These two books can be given a warm welcome, but they are very different from one another. Die Wasserversorgung Antiker Stddte is one of a series of volumes put out by the Frontinus- Gesellschaft, whose work is well known. The first volume was preoccupied with the water supply in Rome, while the second was mainly concerned with Pergamum. This volume is devoted especially to the water systems, both civil and military, in the northern provinces of the Roman empire; but it contains also thematic essays on baths, building techniques, and hygiene. In what is called a ' Bildanhang' examples of an even wider variety of water systems in Europe and N. Africa are also succinctly described, and depicted, in alphabetical order from Aix-en-Provence to Segovia. Whatever the interest of the essays, it is this mass of information which gives the volume unique value. The whole production - photographs (many in colour), maps, plans, descriptions and bibliographies - is of exemplary standard. Highly professional and scholarly though it is, the aim has been to make the astonishing achievements of antiquity in the management of water understandable, and accessible to the interested layman. That at least is a quality it shares with George Hauck's The Aqueduct of Nemausus. I have never read a book about an aqueduct quite like this one. It is a semi-fictionalised account of the building of the water supply at Nimes under Augustus. As Trevor Hodge points out in his Foreword this is a format to which we are accustomed in, say, a television documentary, but not in a scholarly book. Yet this is a work of scholarship with full bibliography and good index. Instead of being written by a classical scholar with a little engineering knowledge, it is by an engineer with a passionate interest in the Romans, and a deep respect for the Pont du Gard. Once one has adjusted to the format of a story being told, and accepted the digressions explaining things Roman to the layman, there is much to be learned. The enthusiasm for the ancient world may be that of an amateur, but the understanding of the problems of surveying, maintenance of a gradient, and building practices, is very much that of a professional, and all too rare in the study of ancient technology. The Postscript is particularly illuminating, when fiction is abandoned, and a judgement about the success of the whole extraordinary scheme at Nimes is offered. Of course, the system there has been the subject of intense study since 1984 and new results may change the picture, and it is true that even today some problems about water flow are not perfectly understood. But it seems clear that the Romans at Nimes emerge from a modern engineer's scrutiny with enormous credit. These channels, bridges and castella were indeed, in the Frontinus-Gesellschaft's word, 'Wunderwerke '. But if you want to know what it might have been like to set out to construct such a system, read Hauck's story. It opens the eyes. University of St Andrews G. E. R I C K M A N J. C. COULSTON, E. J.

An Introduction (pp. xv-xix) outlines what is included (the western part of Hadrian's Wall with its northern outpost forts at Netherby and Bewcastle, and, in a separate section, Carlisle), arrangement, what is excluded (architectural sculpture apart from decorated window heads and door lintels, and undecorated altars), the problem of' Celtic heads', new finds, dating (most if not all second or third century A.D.), distribution (clustered around the Wall and forts), materials (nearly all local buff sandstone, or local red sandstone which can occur in white, yellow or purple forms; unfortunately the other materials occasionally used - limestone, bronze - are not discussed, nor is there an Index of Materials), methods (including covering with gesso, and painting) and workshops. 535 items are then catalogued, as follows: Part I, Hadrian's Wall west of the river North Tyne: (1) Roman deities (Aesculapius, Apollo, Atlas, Victories, Cupid, Diana, Disciplina, Fortuna, Genius, Hercules, Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Mercury, Minerva, Neptune, Numen Augusti, Nymphs, River God, Silvanus, Triton, Victory), (2) oriental deities (Attis (?), Attis or Men, Cautes, Cautopates, Cybele, Juno Regina, Jupiter Dolichenus, Mithras, Regina Caelestis, Sol Mithras, Sol, Sol Invictus, Sea Suria), (3) Romano-Celtic deities (Blatucadrus, Belatucairus, Cocidius, Coventina, Epona, Genii Cucullati, Latis, Maponus, Mars Thincsus, Mars Cocidius, Mater, Tres Matres, Matres Domesticae, Ratis, Sattada, Vitiris, Hueteris, Veteres, the Vitires), (4) portraiture (Commodus bronze statuette), (5) funerary monuments (all gravestones), (6) building records (dedication slabs, building stones, both often with relief decoration), (7) altars to unknown deities, (8) unidentified anthropomorphic figures, (9) animals (sea-monsters, horse, bird, sheep, quadruped, eagle, deer, boar, ox-head, bull, canine, Capricorn, Pegasus), (10) miscellaneous sculptures (including phallus reliefs); Part II, Carlisle: (1) Roman deities (Genius, Hercules, Mercury), (2) oriental deities (Cautes, Sol), (3) Romano-Celtic deities (Genii Cucullati, Tres Matres, Mater), (4) funerary monuments (gravestones, statue, lions, pine-cone and snake, pine-cone), (5) altars to unknown deities, (6) unidentified anthropomorphic figures, (7) animals (boar, dog, hare (?), bull), (8) miscellaneous sculptures (phallus), (9) sculptures of unknown provenance in the City Museum, Carlisle. There are indexes of deities, military units, persons, places and animals and phalli. Illustrations are acceptable (117 deserved better), and the text good, apart from an almost total lack of description of stonecarving techniques regarding each stone item-a CSIR requirement, and all the more surprisingly absent as Phillips himself has written on the subject elsewhere: these deserved brief description, and inclusion in an Index. Some highlights are pieces from Chesters (Juno Regina, 117), Housesteads (described- perhaps slightly over-enthusi- astically - in 1725 by the British antiquarian Stukeley as' deserving to be accounted the Tadmor [Palmyra] of Britain', p. xvii) and Carrawburgh with its Mithraeum; all, however provincial in style, show the rich interplay between Roman and regional culture.

Pp. 69; 27 plates. Vienna: Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1987. 6S 630 (paper, oS 490). This is a catalogue of Roman sculpture from two separate areas in Austria, treated separately but put together in one volume because the material from each is too meagre for a book to itself. The first is the territory of the municipium of Aguntum, modern Dolsach, near Lienz, which lay in SW Noricum. The second is Brigantium, modern Bregenz, in the Vorarlberg, W. Austria- in the Roman province of Raetia. In each case a brief introduction gives the history of the district in Roman times and of its archaeological exploration, followed by a catalogue with full details of each object: where found, where now located, size, material, state of preservation, bibliography, description, with some conclusions about the nature of the piece concerned and, where possible, its date. The pieces are all more or less fragmentary. For Aguntum, 8 entries are fragments of bronze statues: hair with rays attached from a statue of Sol, bits of togate statues, a tiny piece of a third-early fourth-century portrait and of an equestrian statue. There are two fragments of stone statues and 17 fragmentary reliefs: the majority are funerary, the subjects typical of Roman Noricum. The most curious item, however, is a stele of local slate, inscribed Popaius Se[n]ator, with a roughly worked head which may (or may not) belong to it. The date and even authenticity of both have been questioned, though some authors have seen them as 0009-840X/89 $3.00 ? Oxford University Press 1989</page></plain_text>
