DAVIS, ANNE DEMITRACK, ELENI MANTZOURANI, THOMAS F. STRASSER, AND LAUREN E. TALALAY Abstract Surface studies of a Middle Neolithic site near Nemea have produced pottery, chipped stone, and other finds which can be used to investigate economic and social links with contemporary settlements in the northeast Pelopon- nesos. Discovery of the site by survey and its subsequent archaeological and geological exploration exemplify the methods developed by the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project to examine terrain in which large quantities of artifacts of many different dates are regularly found to be widely dispersed in the landscape. Examination of the extent and total distribution of Neolithic finds in the Nemea area provides a perspective on changes in settle- ment within the Neolithic period and in the subsequent Early Bronze Age. INTRODUCTION Systematic, intensive, problem-oriented archaeo- logical survey is a relatively new technique in Greece, one still to be fully accepted by both local and foreign scholars.1 Archaeologists, of course, have always scouted for sites to dig, but the idea that surface re- mains in themselves can provide information useful for reconstructing the settlement histories of a region has not yet become widely accepted. While regional survey has become an established research tool over the past decade, debate continues about the best way to organize fieldwork. There is obviously no single correct way to conduct a survey: methods must fit the goals and resources of a project. Nonetheless, difficul- ties exist which have plagued surveys in the Mediter- ranean and which limit the usefulness of data col- lected by them. Our presentation of a new Middle Neolithic (MN) site found near Nemea provides an opportunity to propose solutions to some of these, and at the same time to discuss the potential contribution of archaeological survey to the study of an important stage in Greek prehistory. A major problem to be faced in all surveys, wher- ever they take place, is the fact that the occurrence of artifacts over the surface of the landscape is not lim- ited to discrete, neatly defined packages-that is, to those entities usually called sites. Recent work has demonstrated very clearly that the surface archaeolog- ical record of a region should be thought of as a vari- able distribution of residue from past cultural activi- ties, in some places dense, in others less so. The tradi- tional emphasis on high-density concentrations (i.e., sites) alone ignores much potentially useful informa- tion which can be recovered through survey: clearly, many activities relevant to the understanding of past social and economic processes occurred at locations other than permanently inhabited settlements and may have left relatively little in the way of obvious artifactual remains.2 To focus on sites alone is also to ignore problems of site definition. Since artifacts are to be found virtually everywhere in the landscape, the size of any high-den- sity concentration of artifacts can only be measured objectively in relation to the overall density of artifacts in its vicinity or throughout the region as a whole. A more serious difficulty is presented by the fact that-in the Mediterranean, at least--single-period sites are uncommon: more often, surface assemblages are pa- limpsests of material resulting from many different ac- SFor some of the issues involved, see, e.g., D.R.

Map of the northeast Peloponnesos showing the area investigated by the Nemea Valley Archaeological Survey tivities that took place over long periods of time. Conse- quently, the survey archaeologist is justified in assum- ing, as a working premise, that the high-density con- centrations he or she finds probably include among them those locations which have served as the focus of repetitive, long-lived activities at various times in the past; settlement is certainly the most conspicuous of these. But to demonstrate that any one location was the focus of such behaviors at any particular time requires comparison,for that period alone, between the density of material at a site and at all other locations around it. Both of these problems are severe and they have hampered the usefulness, for comparative purposes, of much survey data collected in the past. Systematic ground coverage, although a crucial part of intensive survey, is not adequate if sites are not defined objec- tively.3 Elsewhere, in Europe, in Africa, and in the New World, there have been attempts to skirt the problem of site definition by conducting non-site sur- veys.4 The strategy in projects of this sort has been to collect and analyze all artifacts, no matter where they are found or whether they exist at high densities or not. Interpretations of past behavior are then based on this total set of finds of various types and dates and on the way in which they vary in quantity across the sur- face of the landscape. It is difficult to see, however, how such a procedure could be put into practice in most parts of the Mediterranean, especially within the context of a diachronic survey which has as its target the history of all human activity in a given region. The quantities of artifacts typically encountered are truly staggering.5 It is perhaps not widely appreciated that 3 J.F.

Such densities, by no means untypical, may be contrasted, for example, with "background" density levels of around 0.8 sherds per hectare encountered in a recent intensive survey in Roman Britain: T.M.

This paper, which draws on our recent experience in devising and implementing a methodology of survey for use in Greece, is intended as a contribution to the continuing debate about ap- propriate survey design. In what follows, we first briefly outline our methods and then introduce, as a case study, the discovery and further investigation of a Greek MN site which may serve partly to illustrate, partly to evaluate, our field techniques. THE NEMEA SURVEY AND ITS DESIGN The Nemea Valley Survey is part of the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project, a regional archaeologi- cal and anthropological study conducted under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sciences and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and sponsored by Bryn Mawr College.' The survey is concerned with the investigation of changing patterns of past human activity and settle- ment within an area of some 85 km.2, centered on the Sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea and the nearby prehis- toric site on the hill of Tsoungiza, currently under ex- cavation by the Project (fig. 1). The essential feature of the method of survey is the examination of many individual "tracts" (natural or arbitrary areas of relatively uniform vegetation, land use, and visibility, no more than 1 or 2 ha. in size) by team members walking across them at ca. 15-m. inter- vals in parallel transects. Each member uses a hand- held counter to record quantities of pottery, tile, and other materials for each 1 00-m. segment of their one or more "passes" across the tract; collections are made of all potentially diagnostic pottery (i.e., all but undeco- rated body sherds), all chipped stone, and other rele- vant materials. Tracts are described in terms of their present-day land use, soil type and vegetation cover. The end result is an archive of mosaic-like maps which now cover several thousand surveyed tracts and which show the overall density and distribution of artifacts of various kinds and dates over the entire area surveyed. From these maps it is possible, for instance, to evaluate 6 The project is indebted to many donors for their finan- cial support.

A second phase of operation (essentially indepen- dent of the initial fieldwalking) involves returning to selected parts of the landscape for more detailed stud- ies, usually including the collection of additional arti- facts. Following one or more revisitations and inspec- tion of the data from relevant tracts, certain anoma- lously dense concentrations of finds with definable spatial limits are singled out as places requiring fur- ther detailed work (fig. 2). Among them are those lo- cations which most archaeologists would readily agree should be called "sites." The details of the research strategy employed at this second stage are determined by the problems to be in- vestigated. In general, we require more specific infor- mation on the size of the artifact concentration, on the chronological range of surface materials, and on the nature and variety of activities carried out at the loca- tion. Standard procedure involves the collection of all artifacts within circles of 1.5 m. radius, located at 5- or 10-m. intervals along each of four orthogonal tran- sects laid over the area of dense artifact distribution; large "grab" samples of additional diagnostic artifacts are gathered from each of the four quadrants defined by these transects. Very often, however, in cases where greater spatial resolution seems desirable, a grid of 5-, 10-, or 20-m. squares (or, occasionally, some other de- sign) is laid down to provide better control over collec- tion and recording. Later work at such places normal- ly includes documentation by means of photographs, sketch maps, and measured drawings; less often (be- cause it is not always possible for technical reasons), further information about subsurface remains might be sought, for instance by geophysical prospection.7 SITE 702 The efficacy of this sort of multistage exploratory survey procedure is best illustrated by example. From among the dozens of locations routinely explored in this way by the Nemea Valley Survey (see fig. 2), we have chosen to concentrate upon the history of the dis- covery of just one, a dominantly MN site lying only a few hundred meters to the north of the National Highway from Corinth to Argos, at the point where it drops down through the Tretos Pass. The site lies within a newly planted, staked vine- yard above and to the east of the modern road from Dervenakia to Iraklion (Archaia Nemea), on the crest of a narrow spur (named Lygkaiika) that extends southwest from an area of marly upland known locally as the Rachi Mantzorou (fig. 3). The spur is bordered by small stream valleys on both sides, 20-30 m. be- neath its crest. Artifacts are for the most part concen- trated in a single field, freshly cultivated at the time of discovery, and surrounded by fruit trees, with a larger olive grove to the north. In several places the soft, bril- liant-white marly soil is interrupted by much darker, reddish or reddish-brown, soil colorations, spread over a total area of ca. 85 by 100 m. (i.e., 0.85 ha.). On 10 July 1986, a team had completed examina- tion of lower ground to the east and southeast and was gradually working its way west, toward the crest of the ridge of Lygkaiika; up to that point only sporadic artifactual material had been observed. Tract III-72-69 (the number assigned by the team leader to the newly planted vineyard),8 however, was a differ- ent story. As the team progressed through the field from east to west, two of the four walkers soon began to note abnormally high quantities of potsherds and a few lithic artifacts (fig. 4). In particular, the pottery appeared to be concentrated in two large areas of the discolored reddish-brown soil through which the only two walkers who recognized much pottery had passed. This concentration, in other words, was one which only closely spaced fieldwalkers would have been like- ly to spot-and, indeed, it has gone unnoticed until now, despite its proximity to one of the most heavily traveled highways in Greece. From subsequent plotting of densities of artifacts in all surrounding tracts, it became clear that not only were finds significantly more plentiful in Tract III-72-69, but also that the concentration was well- bounded and appeared to be limited within this tract (fig. 4). The relatively small sample of sherds was cleaned for examination, and all appeared to be of Further details of survey procedures adopted at Nemea are given in J.C. Wright, J.F. Cherry, J.L. Davis, E. Mant- zourani, and S.B. Sutton, "The Nemea Valley Archaeologi- cal Project 1984-1986: A Preliminary Report," (in prepara- tion).

Tracts as defined on the ridge of Site 702, with arti- fact densities observed by individual fieldwalkers MN date; one sherd of the same period was also noted in the adjacent Tract III-72-71 to the south. On the other hand, among the chipped stone was a large tri- angular chert projectile point, whose best parallels are with a type so far known only in the Greek Final Neo- lithic;' it had been found midway across the tract at its southern edge. These various pieces of information encouraged a revisit to the location by a small group, in order to check informally, and perhaps to supple- ment, the information collected by the field team, and to decide if additional work was warranted. Three main observations resulted from this second visit: 1) It was apparent that, to the east and north, the borders of the distribution of surface artifacts were nearly coincident with the edges of the tract, but this did not seem to be the result of differential conditions of visibility. To the west, still in the same field, were relatively few finds, despite excellent visibility. To the south, the matter was less certain: although high den- sities here too seemed coterminous with the edge of the tract, the neighboring tract to the southwest was filled with the stubble of cut straw and it was extremely difficult to examine the surface of the ground. 2) With- in the tract itself, it appeared that artifacts were large- ly restricted to the patches of dark soil. 3) All the pot- tery examined in the field (but not collected) during this revisit was either certainly or probably of the MN period, and there seemed to be virtually no evi- dence for the existence of significant components of later date. A fragment of a Neolithic terracotta figu- rine (presented below) was discovered at this stage of our investigations. These observations raised interesting questions which could only be answered by further work. Was the presence/absence of artifacts really correlated with soil type and, if so, why? Had the boundaries of the artifact concentration been correctly determined on all sides and do they therefore give a reliable esti- mate of its size? At the same time, the lack of later material suggested that this location might not have been extensively disturbed after the Neolithic and that its surface assemblage might closely reflect the struc- ture of buried remains. If this were so, we could hope to learn something of their spatial organization from carefully controlled collection of materials on the sur- face. Furthermore, considering the general scarcity of sites of this date known in southern Greece,10 there seemed to be here an opportunity to make a usefully large and representative collection of artifacts of the period with relatively little effort. Given that further work was desirable, Tract III-72-69 was assigned the Nemea Valley Archaeo- logical Survey location number 702 and plans were made to collect all surface finds, according to a 5-m.2 grid laid over most of the tract (fig. 5). The grid was established rapidly with the aid of sighting compasses and 50-m. tapes; intersections of all grid lines were marked with easily visible plastic tape on which the number of each square was written. Surveyors, in teams of two, were then instructed to gather from each square all potsherds with a maximum dimension of 1 cm. or more and all artifacts of other kinds; in actual 9 Number 9372-8-46 in the museum inventory system of the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project.

The work of collecting artifacts from an eventual total of 353 separate 5-m. squares involved the labor of between half a dozen and 15 individuals, spread over the course of two days. Subsequent visits were made on a number of occasions by other archaeological members of the Nemea Proj- ect, by specialists in the Greek Neolithic and-most importantly-by the Project's geologists. GEOMORPHOLOGICAL STUDIES Two quaternary geologists, Anne Demitrack and Tina Niemi, mapped the distribution of soil types so that it would be possible to compare them with artifact distributions (figs. 5 and 6). In the absence of natural exposures, the soil stratigraphy at Site 702 was exam- ined by means of augering to give us information on the depth and nature of subsurface deposits. Setting and Soil Cover The local bedrock is a fine-grained, white marl of late Pliocene Age which is soft and weathers into a Xli .2 i 0 10 20 30 M ;)i!J()~~il mmmN )l !i Sherds/5 x 5 m. square: 1-10 11-50 51-100 &gt;100 Fig. 5.

The new vineyard which occupies the site is noticeably gullied on its fringes and slopes, a re- sponse to the soft bedrock and to the poor leafage of the young vines which provides little protection for the soil. Three components comprise the exposed surface (fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of each): 1) exposed bedrock; 2) brown colluvium; and 3) patches of dark red or gray soil. The exposed bedrock is either plowed marl or marl with a shallow (&lt; 30 cm.) pale (10 YR 7/3: very pale brown) soil cover which has formed in place by weathering of the bedrock.11 The brown col- luvium is of similar origin but is older, thicker (30-70 cm.), and slightly darker (10 YR 6/3: pale brown) due to its greater organic content; it is moving down- slope slowly under the force of gravity. The patches of dark red or gray soil have distinctive colors (5 YR 3/4: dark reddish-brown; 7.5 YR 4/4: dark brown; 10 YR 4/2: dark grayish-brown), limited distribution, and are associated with artifacts. These patches appear to be remnants of the Neolithic soil cover. Figure 7 shows stratigraphic descriptions for four of a total of 12 cores that were taken. It should be noted that, of these four, all except Core 4 contained Neolithic sherds and that all reached the weathered natural marl bedrock, at depths of between 0.8 and 1.5 m. Implications of Soil Distribution and Stratigraphy The dark red and gray patches are the features of principal geological interest on the site. Even without the presence of artifacts, it would be apparent from their well-defined soil horizons (Bt-Bca-Cox), the presence of clay films in their Bt horizons (common thin clay films), and the rubification (reddening) of the red (5 YR) soil (all of which are the result of thou- sands of years of weathering), that these are ancient soils or paleosols (fig. 7).12 (It is presumed that the parent material resembled the pale silt loam that weathers from the bedrock marl today [Core 4].) While the degree of advancement of soil development is not in itself a sufficient criterion for dating, the de- gree of development of the red paleosol is in accord with that of Neolithic and/or Early Bronze Age soils elsewhere in the Nemea region and in the southeast Argolid.'3 The Neolithic age of the artifacts at Site I All colors are coded according to the Munsell Soil Color Charts. 12 P.W.

Interpretative map of soil cover at Site 702, based on color variability and textural changes 702 gives a terminus post quem for the development of the paleosol, particularly since the stratigraphy of Core 1 preserves an apparent occupation horizon as a primary feature. In this 10-cm. horizon, a relative abundance of charcoal fragments and sherds coincides with a distinct color change to brown, in contrast to the red color above and the light brown below. The precise formation processes which have led to the development of the dark red and gray patches re- main unclear. There are two possibilities: 1) The soil may be the original brown forest soil associated with the open woodland which existed here before Neolith- ic occupation, but it is a somewhat deeper red than comparable soils common as remnants on marls in the southern Argolid and Argive Plain today. If so, it would be necessary to assume that it was disturbed and reworked in the Neolithic and has since partly re- generated to form a profile of about the same state of maturity as Early Bronze Age soils in the area. 2) Al- ternatively, the soil may be of immediately post-Neo- lithic age and may have developed on the newly aban- doned Neolithic surface. The latter explanation is perhaps preferable since there appears to have been some deposition over the Neolithic occupation levels before soil formation began. The profile, though a little dark, is otherwise similar to Early Bronze Age soils in the Argolid and the extra redness could have been inherited from the pre-Neolithic soils, some of which washed over the cultural deposits. The preservation of these paleosol fragments on an actively gullied spur crest is most likely a result of their protection in surface depressions. In contrast to the thin or nonexistent modern soil covering the bed- rock across much of the tract (typified by Core 4: 20 cm.), the red and gray paleosol patches rest in com- paratively deep depressions in the marl (Core 1: 115 cm.; Core 2: 80 cm.); their original extent cannot be determined from what remains today. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDS The Pottery All but a few of the almost 4000 sherds collected from Site 702 may, on the basis of their fabric and surface treatment, be identified as MN Urfirnis.'4 Semi-fine patterned, semi-fine monochrome, and coarse wares are represented; the latter are most com- mon. About 250 sherds may be assigned to a particu- lar shape. Shapes represented by the Patterned Urfirnis sherds include pedestaled bowls; ring-based bowls 14 Cf. E.

On the other hand, polychrome-effect patterns consist of parallel or perpendicular lines or bands, or of lozenges. Paints have been fired to produce the following combinations of colors: black on gray; black on brown; brown and red; and red and black. Only rarely did the potter bur- nish over the top of a pattern. All Patterned Urfirnis shapes occur also in Mono- chrome Urfirnis. The paint used to coat monochrome vessels has generally fired dark brown or mahogany-- less commonly, black, red, or orange. At times the paint is burnished. Of medium-tall, gray ring bases (fig. 8a) in a hard, very fine, uniformly gray fabric, the surfaces of two were burnished outside and one has a single perforation; their fabric and that of a few small poorly preserved sherds may be related to "Corinthian Gray Ware" and, if so, they are Late Neolithic."I A chevron(?) incised on a base fragment (fig. 8) is only rarely paralleled at other sites: all examples may be the result of uncompleted attempts to remove cut-outs of the sort common on pedestaled bases.'6 Among the Coarse Urfirnis pottery, storage vessels with flat-topped rims (Th. ca. 1-1.5 cm.) are the best- represented shape (fig. 8m, n). Surfaces may be painted solid brown inside, outside, or both; the top of the rim may also be painted.

A possible "cheese bowl" fragment found ca. 15 m. farther south, with a double row of perfora- tions, pierced before firing, may also be Final Neolith- ic (fig. 8s).24 The crumbly buff to pink fabric of sever- al very coarse bulbous rims (e.g., fig. 8o), probably of shallow basins, may point to the same date. In addi- tion to these few prehistoric sherds not of MN date, two black-glazed ring bases and about 50 tile frag- ments were found, primarily near the northern edge of the pottery distribution and eroding downslope to the south; they indicate a very minor component of Classi- cal date. For the most part, the MN pottery resembles that characteristic of the rest of the northeast Peloponne- sos;25 the shapes are those typical of Ayioryitika, Cor- inth, Franchthi Cave, and Lerna. At 702, as at these other sites, such pottery was probably associated with permanent habitation. The quantity of pottery later than MN is not sufficient to demonstrate continuous occupation from Middle to Final Neolithic, nor even a second phase of settlement in the later period. Terracotta Figurine A single fragment of an anthropomorphic terracotta figurine was found (fig. 9): S702-2-1.26 Left leg and part of torso of standing fe- male figurine. H. max. 9.1 cm.; W. max. 2.7 cm.; Th. max. 3.2 cm. Reddish-yellow fabric (5 YR 6/6) with decoration in red paint (2.5 YR 4/8). The piece, which is comparable to 18 other exam- ples from five different sites in the northern Pelopon- nesos (Franchthi Cave, Lerna, Corinth, Asea, and Akratas), can be securely dated to the MN period on the basis of previously established typologies.27 It ex- hibits a number of characteristics typical of the so- called "split-leg" type, the most salient feature of which is a well-smoothed, regular, and fairly flat me- dial surface. Along this edge the matching leg was once attached. It has been argued elsewhere that the medial surface was deliberately prepared to minimize adher- medial side front side back S 5cm. Fig. 9. Fragment of Middle Neolithic "split-leg" figurine. (Drawing by L. Pinch and J. Pfaff) ence between the legs and to insure that, when desired, the two halves could intentionally be split apart.28 The leg fragment from Site 702 has this character- istic medial surface, but exhibits a slightly more con- cave profile. Other features in common with examples found elsewhere include: 1) narrow waist and pro- truding buttocks; 2) incised (and/or painted) pubic triangle; 3) diagonal incisions (and/or a small scar or lump) on the upper thigh to indicate fingers (or a hand); and 4) a limited number of painted designs drawn from the repertoire of MN pottery. A few fea- tures stand out as unusual and probably represent particular choices on the part of the maker. Most not- able is the punctated pubic area, not only rare in gen- eral for MN figurines and anomalous for this type, but paralleled in southern Greece by only one frag- ment from the Franchthi Cave.29 The punctates may portray cicatrizing, hair, or clothing; on the other hand, they may be purely aesthetic patterning, or have symbolic and non-representational intent. Although much of the paint is worn away, the origi- nal design can be partly reconstructed. On the outer 24 Cf. S.A.

Comparable designs are found on the back and sides of legs from Lerna,30 Corinth,31 and Akratas.32 Small flecks of red pigment adhering to the front of the leg suggest that this side was also painted, but the sur- face is badly preserved and the design cannot be recon- structed. Aside from the sides of the legs, a belt-like configuration appears to encircle the waist at the back and consists of a horizontal line from which diagonal lines, small upright triangles, or hour-glass elements project. A belt (or vest) is similarly represented on the back of a figurine from Franchthi.33 It has recently been suggested that figurines of this kind served as special contracts or identifying tokens among MN communities.34 As symbols of social and economic bonds, "split-leg" figurines may have served as devices to mark regional ties and obligations within these preliterate societies. If this interpretation is cor- rect, then the people who inhabited or frequented Site 702 may have participated in alliances with areas as far removed as Franchthi, Corinth, Lerna, and Akra- tas. Regional interaction and interdependence among such settlements could have developed as a result of ties established via exogamous marriage patterns, of intersettlement cooperation during times of productive scarcity, and in order to facilitate exchange of valued resources." The Tretos Pass serves as a natural corri- dor of communication between coastal sites in the north (e.g., Corinth) and those farther south in the Argolid (e.g., Franchthi and Lerna). At the same time, it lies along an east-west corridor leading through the Nemea Valley and up into the Arcadian mountains to the west (see figs. 1 and 2). It would hardly be surprising to find that Site 702 was well- connected to these areas. Chipped Stone The sample of chipped stone from the site is very limited, comprising 24 pieces, many of which are tiny; 14 are obsidian, most likely Melian, and the remaind- er a variety of local brown and black cherts.36 The material consists almost entirely of decorticated flakes. The exceptions are a flake retouched as a pergoir, a possible piece esquillke, a sickle element, and the large triangular projectile point (mentioned above); the first two of these are made of obsidian, the last two of chert. Only the point is chronologically diagnostic (of the Final Neolithic). All the other pieces could belong as easily in a Bronze Age lithic industry as in a Neolithic one. However, their spatial distribution on the surface of the site (fig. 10) corresponds very closely to that of the MN pottery, and it is probable that the lithics and ceramics belong together chronologically. The lack of obsidian blades and core fragments is surprising and perhaps suggests that not all aspects of the chipped stone industry at the site are represented in this small sample." Other Finds In the course of detailed collection a number of fragments of unbaked clay daub were found associated with the northern concentrations. Two samples were inspected for the presence of incorporated plant mat- ter; no identifiable specimens were noted."38 THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINDS The distributions of artifacts of various kinds sug- gest that, to some extent, the spatial patterning of sur- face finds reflects that of subsurface deposits. First, it should be noted that despite substantial agricultural usage of the site, including deep-ploughing and roto- tilling, artifacts are not scattered at random through- out the tract, but retain their association with the cul- tural material trapped in the deep bedrock pockets. Second, we have some evidence for functional varia- tion within the site. Coarse pottery and, in particular, square-topped storage vessel rims were found in all three main deposits of red soil, as was debitage of chipped stone (fig. 10).

Distribution of chipped stone at Site 702 the other hand, is decidedly more abundant in the south (fig. 11). It should also be noted that both the figurine fragment and the triangular chert point were also associated with this concentration, while frag- ments of probable daub were found only in the north. Chronological as well as functional variability in the artifactual distributions can also be discerned. Possible Final Neolithic pottery comes only from the north-central parts of the tract; on the other hand, the chert point, which is probably of similar date, comes from the southern edge. Finds of the historical periods are mostly limited to a small and discrete cluster in the northwest. The densities of MN artifacts at Site 702 are sig- nificantly higher than is characteristic at Nemea and it is clear that the location deserves to be considered as a focus for activities in that period. Even if most undi- agnostic sherds in adjacent areas were of MN date (unlikely given the high diagnosticity of the fabric of most MN pottery), the concentration at Site 702 would still emerge as exceptional. It seems likely, moreover, that Site 702 was a habitation site. There is no reason to believe that it served any other purpose and, as has been observed, its broad range of fine and coarse pottery is absolutely characteristic of other MN settlements in the northeast Peloponnesos. The pres- ence of daub in association with the northern concen- trations may point to the existence of wattle-and-daub structures. The size of the community that lived at Site 702 is uncertain.

Density of Patterned Urfirnis sherds at Site 702 tected in depressions in the bedrock, then it is possible that in Neolithic times the entire marl surface of the field was once covered with cultural material, now en- tirely eroded or removed by human agency. The plot of the density of pottery recovered at the site (fig. 5) suggests that our grid reached the edge of the site to the west and east, and probably also to the north, nor did less systematic, but nonetheless careful, inspection to the north and south produce evidence that the site had continued any significant distance in either direc- tion. To judge from the preserved remains, therefore, the area settled in the Neolithic was about the same size as, or smaller than, the tract itself. DISCUSSION The results of investigations at Site 702 are of some interest, both for the archaeology of the Neolithic era in the Peloponnesos, and for the conduct of surface surveys in Greece. It may be noted, first of all, how much useful information of controlled reliability has been obtained without any excavation having taken place. This location was almost certainly the focus of habitation in the MN period; the finds are wholly typical of domestic assemblages elsewhere in the northeast Peloponnesos, and augering appears in one case to have located an actual living surface (fig. 7). Variations in artifact distributions suggest that some of the structure of activity areas is still preserved in subsurface deposits. On the other hand, the site is ex- tremely fragile, and the possibility exists that more of the site has been completely eroded than today re- mains in situ.</page><page sequence="14">172 CHERRY, DAVIS, DEMITRACK, MANTZOURANI, STRASSER, AND TALALAY [AJA 92 What contribution has Site 702, and other Neo- lithic finds from the Nemea Valley Archaeological Survey, made to the wider picture of early prehistoric settlement in this part of Greece? One cautionary point concerning generalization about regional pat- terns should be made immediately. Almost all known findspots of MN artifacts are represented by exca- vated levels, often buried beneath later occupation on multi-period sites. Our perception of the location of Neolithic settlement and land use has undoubtedly been influenced by the lucky accident that certain lo- cations were used again in later times; so it is pertinent to ask what proportion of the original complement of sites has survived without the protection of later over- burden and to what extent the rate of their survival has been dependent on local geological conditions. A comparison of the overall picture of settlement in the Nemea area before survey with that revealed by sur- vey is informative. Neolithic finds had been forthcoming only at the Classical polis center of Phlius39 (EN, MN, and LN?), on the hill of Tsoungiza40 (EN and MN), and within the Sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea (EN).41 In the case of Phlius, it is fair to say that attention was drawn to the site by its importance in historical times: prehis- toric remains were relatively few and were buried deep beneath later levels. At Tsoungiza it was work in the nearby Classical sanctuary of Nemean Zeus that brought archaeologists to the village of Iraklion, on the outskirts of which Tsoungiza lies.42 Survey has now added significant new information, including not only new finds, but also the existence of contrasts between the various stages of the Neolithic which were not previously apparent. It is clear that there was Early Neolithic (EN) settlement in several parts of the survey area: in the north of the Nemea Valley at Site 3, in the Tretos Pass at Site 201, and less certainly at Site 101, as well as at the Sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea, Tsoungiza, and Phlius (fig. 12). The distribution of EN finds at the last two sites is spa- tially quite limited, and it is not obvious that either settlement was much larger than these new sites, or that a wider range of activities was conducted at them. Finds at the Sanctuary of Zeus, on the other hand, are more widely distributed, but the depositional nature of these levels remains unclear; their location near the bed of what is now the Nemea River, as well as the extremely worn condition of all the pottery, strongly suggests the possibility that the artifactual material in them is in secondary contexts. Indeed, several hundred meters farther south, EN pottery has been found buried in stream deposits exposed by the excavation of house foundations in 1986 within the modern village of Iraklion. The two MN findspots previously known (i.e., Phlius and Tsoungiza) are now complemented by two new sites, one of them the subject of this paper. The other (Site 700) lies very close to it, about half a kilo- meter to the southeast and in a very similar topo- graphic setting overlooking the Tretos Pass (fig. 3). This site, which was discovered and recorded in essen- tially the same manner as Site 702, is also dominantly MN in date and somewhat larger in extent than 702; but visibility conditions for surface collection are much less ideal, and the state of preservation of the material is very poor. Both factors, as well as lack of survey in the area, no doubt help explain why this site had not been noted previously, even though it is adja- cent to one of Greece's most heavily traveled high- ways. Other than at Tsoungiza, our project has not produced the slightest trace of MN material within the Nemea Valley, nor have any other isolated finds been made elsewhere within the study area: nothing points to more dispersed settlement than in the pre- vious period. One might be tempted to explain the existence in such proximity of two relatively rich sites 39 W.R.

Caskey, Hesperia 44 (1975) 251-79; Vitelli (supra n. 16) 213. 41 Considerable remains of Neolithic (and perhaps only EN) activity have been excavated in the Sanctuary area, either side of the Nemea River and separated from each other by as much as 150 m. See S.G. Miller, "Excavations at Nemea, 1977," Hesperia 47 (1978) 65; "Excavations at Nemea, 1978," Hesperia 48 (1979) 83; Miller (supra n. 38) 181, 197-98. Our comments here about Neolithic remains in the Sanctuary must remain provisional, pending the re- sults of a fuller study in 1987 by N. Klein of all the prehis- toric material there. 42 O.T.P.K. Dickinson has noted that "... Neolithic ma- terial has thrust itself upon our notice considerably more often in the excavation of characteristic Bronze Age types of site in the north-east Peloponnese than it has done else- where, and it is tempting to suggest that population density was higher there."

Distribution of Neolithic finds in the Nemea region of the period, and the general absence of material else- where, as purely an accident of site survival; but a pat- tern implying avoidance of the main Nemea Valley is equally characteristic of some other periods, both pre- historic and historic.43 Attention has recently been drawn to the possible significance of pastoral transhumance as a factor be- hind the regional pattern of MN settlement distribu- tion and stylistic links in the ceramics from widely separated sites; the chief evidence adduced has been the correspondence between the pattern of MN sites and routes followed in recent times by seasonally transhumant shepherds. The locations of Sites 700 and 702, as well as Tsoungiza, on important natural routes of communication in the northeast Peloponne- sos also fit this pattern and could be interpreted in the same light. On the other hand, although individuals may have done so, the likelihood of whole commu- nities specializing in long-distance transhumance at this stage in Greek prehistory is, for several reasons, 43 Details for later periods are summarized in Wright et al. (supra n. 7).</page><page sequence="16">174 CHERRY, DAVIS, DEMITRACK, MANTZOURANI, STRASSER, AND TALALAY [AJA 92 quite small.44 None of the MN sites in this region, including those discussed here, have produced direct indications for the pursuit of this economic strategy; distributional patterns alone are not sufficient to con- firm the hypothesis. Evidence of the Late and Final Neolithic periods is even more scarce, not only in the Nemea Valley itself, but throughout the survey area. The documentation of substantial habitation requires rather more than the handful of LN sherds from Site 506 and perhaps also from Phlius, and those of FN date from Site 702 (noted above), which is all that is known. Some of the lithic finds from the survey are probably of later Neo- lithic date, and the fact that several LN barbed-and- tanged projectile points have been found in the moun- tainous country to the south of the Nemea Valley may reflect losses during hunting trips made by Neolithic peoples who resided outside the survey area altogeth- er. The fact that we know so little about the distribu- tion of LN and FN material, combined with a relative scarcity of EH I finds, is especially interesting, for it was in these periods that the stage was set for the re- markable developments on the mainland in EH II.45 Our evidence seems to provide no support for the later Neolithic increase in population which, on grounds of survey evidence in the southern Argolid, has been ad- duced as one factor in the development of greater so- cial complexity.46 Bintliff and Snodgrass have recently cautioned that "... it is safest to avoid negative arguments and con- clusions based on the apparent absence of sites in cer- tain localities."47 Yet in cases where survey has been conducted at a suitably intensive level, where geomor- phological and related studies provide some control over changes in the natural landscape and processes of site loss, and where the character and sequence of ar- chaeological material in the region is already fairly well known from excavated sites, it seems unnecessary to be quite so dismissive of negative evidence. These desiderata having been met in the Nemea Valley Ar- chaeological Survey, it is worth considering seriously the spatial and chronological patterns outlined above, and thus also worth comparing them with results achieved elsewhere in recent surveys using methods broadly similar to our own. A review of other such fieldwork is illuminating. During the intensive survey, over several years, of an area in Central Boeotia comparable in size to that of the Nemea Valley Archaeological Survey, only one possible and two definite sites of FN/EH date have been noted, with (so far) nothing earlier, nor in fact very much from later prehistoric times either.48 Sur- vey in the southern Argolid has similarly shown that settlement there was very sparse indeed until the FN period, when more rapid expansion across the penin- sula began; the explosion of sites in the EH II period is very notable.49 A yet more dramatic contrast exists in other southern Greek surveys either still in progress or awaiting publication: in western Arcadia, in central Laconia, and on the Methana peninsula, only a hand- ful of sites belonging to any phase of the Neolithic has come to light so far, whereas Early Bronze Age settle- ments are very abundant indeed. The results from the Nemea Valley Archaeological Survey differ in important respects from these rather consistent patterns elsewhere. In the first place, while 44 Jacobsen (supra n. 10) 29, 33-34, fig. 2.

JHS 107 (1987) 77-87. 45 Perhaps significant in this regard is the discovery at Tsoungiza in 1986 of a single FN Gonia Polychrome sherd and a number of deposits of EH I ceramic material that ap- parently are followed by early EH II habitation. None of this material was recognized in the unpublished excavations at the site by Harland in 1926-1927, and it is not easily recoverable, lying directly atop the bedrock or in pits cut into it without associated architecture. The EH material from the survey is being studied by L. Roberts. 46 T.H. van Andel, C.N. Runnels, and K.O.

Secondly, the chronological distribution of sites does not indicate an empty landscape in the ear- liest phase of the Neolithic, with population expan- sion during its terminal stages and "take-off" in Early Helladic I and II, as seems to be the pattern emerging from most other intensive surveys.s0 Instead, it is the EN phase that has produced most evidence of settle- ment in the Nemea region, with an apparent diminu- tion through MN, LN and FN; even in EH I, there exists abundant material at just two sites (Tsoungiza and Site 204; see fig. 3), with only occasional finds at less than half a dozen other locations, all of them out- side the Nemea Valley and near the Tretos Pass. Only in EH II is there established a coherent pattern of widespread settlement both in and beyond the valley. This is hardly the very slow and gradual overall rate of growth during the three millennia of the Greek Neolithic that has often been envisaged; Jacobsen is surely correct in drawing attention to "the possibilities of shifting settlement patterns and population decline as well as growth.""' We are still far from being able to provide convinc- ing explanations for the changing patterns of Neolithic and Early Bronze Age occupation in the Nemea re- gion, and for why they differ from those in certain other parts of southern Greece. Geomorphological studies in progress suggest that, at times in prehistory (not yet closely dated), some parts of the valley may have been a swamp and it is conceivable that little of it was habitable.52 In any case, an important prerequi- site for making comparisons with other areas is the es- tablishment of reliable information about distribution- al patterns-both positive and negative-of sites and other finds. In our view, this demands intensive tech- niques of field survey: we thus return, briefly, to the methodological questions touched upon at the outset. Dickinson, reviewing regional settlement distribu- tions in the prehistoric Peloponnesos, suggested that early (i.e., Neolithic) material may well be so rare "because older methods of survey ignored characteris- tic types of site."53 The MN Site 702 discussed here serves as a good illustration of the truth of that re- mark. Despite the highly diagnostic character of its pottery, and the fact that it is neither tiny in extent nor in a remote position in the landscape, close-spaced sys- tematic survey was required to locate it.54 Moreover, the routine gathering of surface artifacts from the landscape as a whole, as well as tightly controlled on- site collection, was necessary to provide information sufficient to define the concentration, and to determine its status as a site in an objective manner that allows comparison with sites elsewhere. Finally, it is worth 50so This pattern implies the need for caution in accepting J.L. Bintliff's recent suggestions ("The Boeotia Survey," in Macready and Thompson [supra n. 1] 214-15) concerning the dramatic effects of the cumulative loss of sites, through later alluviation, erosion, and other destructive factors, on "the disparity between observable prehistoric and historic site densities" in Greece. Bintliff preferred to account for the apparent scarcity of prehistoric sites in the Boeotia survey by invoking drastic rates of site loss, rather than accepting the low density of settlement as real. Yet the Nemea Survey has yielded more abundant evidence from the earliest phase of settlement in the area than for a number of much later prehistoric and historic periods. Bintliff's hypothesis that we might expect to see as little as one fifth of the original com- plement of Early Neolithic sites would give an adjusted total of 30 or 40 such sites in the Nemea area, a figure that seems to us far too high to be plausible. 51 T.W. Jacobsen, "Franchthi Cave and the Beginning of Settled Village Life in Greece," Hesperia 50 (1981) 313. 52 The evidence for this statement comes from a series of auger cores in two transects across the Nemea Valley, 0.75 and 1.5 km. north of Tsoungiza; their stratigraphy suggests that sluggish drainage created seasonal or perhaps year- round swampy conditions on the Valley floor sometime in the Early or Middle Holocene. Detailed information is pre- sented in Demitrack (supra n. 13). Travelers' accounts of the Valley in recent centuries also imply the existence of less well-drained conditions than at present. 53 Dickinson (supra n. 42) 131. 54 The Neolithic sites found at Nemea are no smaller than many which have been the focus of well-known excavations. It is generally difficult to evaluate the extent of Neolithic components on multi-period sites, and geomorphological processes of smearing and blending may often result in in- flated estimates. Nonetheless, artifact scatters at Sites 3 (ca. 1.28 ha.), 201 (ca. 0.18 ha.), 700 (ca. 3.8 ha.), and 702 (ca. 0.85 ha.) are, for example, as great or greater than the re- ported total settlement areas at Saliagos (max. 0.37 ha.), Sesklo (ca. 0.4 ha.), Dhimini (ca. 0.49), Sitagroi (0.75), or even Lerna (ca. 0.16 excavated area; ca. 1.8 ha. total mound). Jacobsen has estimated the population of the Neo- lithic community of the Franchthi Cave at ca. 100: the ex- tent of surface distributions at several of our sites suggests that similar population numbers could have been supported.</page><page sequence="18">176 CHERRY, DAVIS, DEMITRACK, MANTZOURANI, STRASSER, AND TALALAY reiterating the obvious point that none of the informa- tion reported here about Site 702 was obtained through excavation, but simply by means of rigorous methods of surface reconnaissance and the efforts of the Project's survey teams and geologists for two or three days.
