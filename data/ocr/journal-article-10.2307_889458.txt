Vol. I: Text: ix + 426 pp. Vol. II: Illustrations: xxxix + 13 col. pls. + 642 b. &amp; w. ills., 277 figs., 4 charts and 7 maps. (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000), ?150. ISBN 0-19- 951374-0. Largely through the work of Arthur Evans, first as Keeper and later as the exca- vator of Knossos, the Ashmolean Museum holds the finest collection of Aegean Bronze Age artefacts outside Greece itself. While the bulk of the collection is from Crete, around a thousand objects come from the Cycladic islands dotted over the Aegean Sea. Over eighty per cent of these are pot- tery fragments from excavations by the British School at Athens (1896-99) at Phy- lakope on Melos, donated by the Greek State. In addition to the pottery, the collec- tion is representative of nearly all major classes of Cycladic material culture. It in- cludes white marble figurines and vessels, fine stone axes and other tools, obsidian implements, beads, terracotta loomweights and metalwork in copper, bronze, silver and lead. Most of these pieces date to the third millennium B.C., the long period of inde- pendent Cycladic creativity before Cretan palatial influence arrived. Susan Sherratt's catalogue presents near- ly 640 of these Cycladica. It is a superlative work of scholarship and immediately finds a central place among a plethora of major Cycladic studies over the last thirty years. Two as recent as the Catalogue are Cyprian Broodbank's An Island Archaeology of the Early Cyclades (2000) andJorg Rombach's Kykladen I und 11 (2000). The value of Sherratt's work is twofold. First, the catalogue and its wealth of com- paranda are so detailed that they serve as an essential point of reference for future researches. Secondly, this is far more than a catalogue. Every class of artefact is in- troduced by a detailed discussion and an always interesting range of possible inter- pretations. Occasionally the scope is too breathtaking, as when (pp.186-87) discoid loomweights become evidence for 'world systems' within a single paragraph. Else- where an image will surely captivate, as when the Kapsala variety of marble figur- ines 'look for all the world as if they have just stepped naked from a bath to stand shiver- ing in a Cycladic breeze'. At several points remarkable emphasis is placed on the possi- bility of Cycladic silver being traded into the Near East in the third millennium and on the contemporaneous diffusion of tech- niques, ideas and forms from there to the islands. The detailed presentation of information on acquisition, mainly in the 1890s, engages with three current, interconnected areas of debate. These are the history and ethics of collecting, the definition and apprecia- tion of 'art' in relation to anthropomorphic sculpture, and the central purpose of ar- chaeology, to try to recover the aims and intentions of the makers and users of the artefacts. For the first of these debates, the central point to be derived from Sherratt's un- flinching presentation of the acquisition data of the collection may be that it is wholly pointless to apply today's standards of an acceptable acquisitions policy to the collector's mindset of a century ago. Nor should we forget that the fertility of that mindset laid the structural foundations for our knowledge of antiquity. As far as the definition and appreciation of the Cycladic figurines as works of pristine white marble are concerned, with all their aesthetic connotations for collectors and artists such as Henry Moore, and the formal comparisons they afford with the works of Brancusi and Modigliani, Sherratt docu- ments the scientific studies which have revealed that the heads and bodies of many of the figures were in fact originally painted in bright colours. Finally, the archaeologist's attempt to understand the functions of objects and the beliefs and values that created them, brings both the above debates into focus. We can penetrate the minds behind such art and craftsmanship only by recovering and re- cording the exact contexts and associations of the objects as deposited in the ground. That is surely a worthwhile objective. Not only do the activities of looters in the service of antiquities dealers, and of the dealers themselves in feeding collectors' aesthetic preferences, constitute a dead end (centred merely on personal feelings about an ob- ject), they also involve the destruction of potential new evidence for the history of art and culture.
