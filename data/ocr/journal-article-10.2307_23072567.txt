<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ART OF BECOMING: THE GRAFFITI OF TIKAL, GUATEMALA Scott R. Hutson In their 1995 Latin American Antiquity article, Haviland and Haviland argued that the people who produced much of the graffiti ofTikal were depicting visions from altered states of consciousness. In this paper, 1 argue that there is room for alternative interpretations. Comparison with children's drawings from across the world suggests that children or people without training in Maya representational conventions authored a portion of the graffiti. Though this portion may be small, the possibility that children were involved provides a rare opportunity to discuss the experience of childhood. I argue that the content of the graffiti and the inter-subjective context of its production reveal several processes of becoming. Among other things, the graffiti permit an account of how children learn: legitimate participation in a community of people with varied levels of experience. This relational understanding of graffiti production also provides grounds for considering inno vation and transformation in the medium of expression. Finally, I argue that the act of representation gives young people a form of mastery over the themes they portray. This helps them to accommodate confusing or difficult relations in their lives and to harmonize with their world in such a way that makes them culturally intelligible subjects. En 1995, Haviland y Haviland publicaron un arti'culo en Latin American Antiquity en donde argumentaron que la gente que produjo la mayoria de los grafiti de Tikal intento representor visiones de estados alterados de conciencia . En este ensayo, sug iero que existen interpretaciones alternativas. Comparaciones con dibujos de nihos de varias culturas indican que ninos o per sonas sin entrenamiento en las convenciones de representacion de la cultura maya escribieron una porcion de los grafiti. Argumento que el contenido de los grafiti y el contexto inter-subjetivo de su produccion revelan varios procesos de realizacion. Los grafiti permiten observaciones sobre un proceso de aprendizaje basado en la participacion en una comunidad de personas con varios niveles de experiencia. Este entendimiento relacional de la produccion de grafittis tambien proporciona una explicacion para la innovacidn y la transformacidn en el medio de expresidn. Finalmente, sostengo que la accion de representacion da a los jovenes un dominio sobre los temas que representan grdficamente. Eso les ayuda a acomodar relaciones diffciles en sus vidas y a armonizarse con el mundo de tal manera que les permite ser sujetos culturalmente inteligibles. Explorers began documenting architectural graffiti in Central America over 150 years ago and have since found them to be abun dant in many parts of the ancient Maya world (Mayer 2009). However, because many graffiti rep resent poorly executed folk art that overlaps min imally with canonical Maya artwork, few scholars have given them serious consideration. This is also true of colonial-era graffiti (Russo 2006) and other kinds of ancient Maya folk art, such as cave paint ing. For example, in her survey of cave art, Stone (1995) devotes only a small portion of the mono graph to schematic or rudimentary paintings. The most sustained study of Maya architectural graffiti argued that it represents hallucinogenic visions experienced in trance (Haviland and Haviland 1995). One of the oldest explanations dismisses graffiti as the trifling repose of bored children (Thompson and Dorsey 1898). Others treat them as the negligible doodles of squatters (Kampen 1978). The apparent crudity of typical Maya graf fiti (Figure 1) animates all explanations. In this paper, I review these explanations and, using cross-cultural data on children's drawings and data on the height at which graffiti were executed, strengthen the idea that children were responsible for some of the graffiti at Tikal. This provides a rare opportunity to write about ancient children. Assum ing that Tikal's demographic profile (Haviland 1967) approximates that of other Maya sites (Storey and McAnany 2006; Whittington 1989) and most premodern societies, about half of the population Scott R. Hutson ■ Department of Anthropology, University of Kentucky, 211 Lafferty Hall, Lexington, KY 40306-0024 (scotthutson@uky.edu) Latin American Antiquity 22(4), 2011, pp. 403-426 Copyright ©2011 by the Society for American Archaeology 403</page><page sequence="2">404 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 1. Graffiti from Tikal (Trik and Kampen 1983: Figure 1; courtesy of the Penn Museum). would have been subadults (Chamberlain 1997). Thus, it is likely that subadults made important con tributions to the daily work of the household, as sug gested by ethnohistorical and ethnographic research (Trachman and Valdez 2006). As in other prein dustrial societies, children had profound impacts on the physical and social environment, even when they were not intentionally attempting to do so (Mayall 1994:116-117; Mizoguchi 2000:142; Sofaer Derevenski 2000; Wilkie 2000:107). Yet such advances in our understanding of ancient child hood do not necessarily provide a window onto the experience of young people. Though these experi ences are missing in canonical Maya art—carved stelae, murals, etc.—graffiti produced by children provide a starting point. Rather than viewing graf fiti merely as youthful distractions, I explore what their contents may reveal about how children accommodated themselves to natural and social worlds. In particular, I argue that the act of repre sentation gives young people a form of mastery over what they chose to portray, thus helping them come into harmony with their world and become culturally intelligible as people. I also argue that people of different ages and skill levels left their marks on the same walls and that there was a dialogue between these different artists. This context of production permits an account of learning as participation in a community of indi viduals with varied levels of experience (Lave and Wenger 1991; Minar and Crown 2001). This is a relational approach to learning (see also Baxter 2005a:23) that presumes that selfhood comes into being through interactions with others (Hutson 2010; Ingold 2000). I will also argue that learning in a community entails a form of becoming inso far as it can lead to innovation and transformation in the medium of expression. The Graffiti ofTikal The word "graffiti" comes from the Italian word "sgraffiato," which derives from the Latin verb to cut or scratch (Fleming 2001:39). Because most</page><page sequence="3">Hutson] GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 405 Figure 2. Examples of Tikal graffiti that show familiarity with Classic Maya art ([a] from Trik and Kampen 1983:Figure 96; [b] from Trik and Kampen 1983:Figure 29c). Courtesy of the Penn Museum. Maya graffiti consist of thin incisions into stucco surfaces of walls, benches, and floors, they do not preserve well (see Mayer 2009 for a recent overview). Usually archaeologists find graffiti on the interiors of buildings that have been protected from the elements. Graffiti have been observed on an extraordinarily wide variety of buildings: resi dences, storerooms, temples, and more. Graffiti have been recorded at 51 sites, clustering in north ern and central Peten/southern Campeche and the Chenes and Rio Bee zones (Mayer 2009). By far the best place to study graffiti is Tikal, one of the largest and best-known Classic period (A.D. 250 to 800) Maya cities (Harrison 1999). Researchers from the University Museum of PennsylvaniaTikal Project attempted to record and publish all graffiti, the results of which were overseen by director William Coe and presented by Helen Trik and Michael Kampen (1983; graffiti continue to be uncovered at Tikal as recently as 2008 as part of the "Plaza de los Siete Templos" project: Mayer 2009:43). In contrast, at other sites such as Uax actun, only the better-preserved examples were published (Smith 1950:83). Furthermore, because of the size of the site and the scope of the Penn pro ject, more graffiti have been documented at Tikal than at any other site. In addition to nonfigurative lines and scribbles, the most common subject matter of graffiti at Tikal consists of people, deities, zoomorphic creatures, pyramids, litters, thrones, and banners. Kampen (1978:155) does not consider graffiti as art because of his observation that they are less deliberately conceived. In other words, the graffiti do not seem to be integrated with their architectural context (Kampen 1978:163; Webster 1963:39). Further more, some designs are haphazardly superimposed on others without any attempt to accommodate the earlier designs (Figure 2a). The majority of the superpositions and juxtapositions are said to be accidental or unintentional, suggesting little con cern for formal relationships of one graffito to</page><page sequence="4">406 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 another (Kampen 1978:166). This characterization also holds for graffiti at other sites: Smith (1950:83) comments that the graffiti at Uaxactun, Guatemala "do not make a uniform decoration and are scat tered at random over the plastered surfaces." According to Kampen (1978:157, 166), the graf fiti lines were rendered quickly, with little concern for descriptive accuracy, and were never retraced, indicating a lack of desire for perfection. Finally, authors have described (or interpreted) the designs at both Tikal and elsewhere as "crude" (Coe 1983:2; Gann 1928:163; Kampen 1978:167; Tozzer 1913:160) lacking in skill (Richardson in Smith 1937:25), "naive" (Morris et al. 1931:361), and "poor" (Haviland and Haviland 1995:298). improvements between the different attempts. Some attempts are not crude at all, though the dis regard for the design's placement on the wall and juxtaposition with other designs suggests that they were not executed as formal art. The multiple ver sions of the lord and palanquin design in the cen tral acropolis of Tikal discussed and reproduced by Scheie and Mathews (1998:91; Trik and Kampen 1983 Figures 72-73) may also represent artists experimenting with a theme. As opposed to most graffiti, these examples show both artistic talent and an understanding of the symbolic vocabulary (Fig ure 2b). In sum, most graffiti exhibit a "cruder" style than canonical Maya artwork. In this analysis, I focus precisely on the crudity of the graffiti. I will pre sent several explanations for this crudity and then give support to the argument that some of the graf fiti were crude because they were done by young people with little artistic experience. After estab lishing this argument, I build on it by discussing what the different levels of experience visible in the graffiti may tell us about learning and inter subjectivity among the ancient Maya. Why are Maya Graffiti "Crude ? I review four explanations for the crudity of Maya graffiti: (1) they are artists' practice sketches, (2) they are the decadent art of post-abandonment squatters, (3) they are renderings of hallucinatory visions seen during trance, and (4) they are done by children. Explanation #1: Graffiti as Practice Sketches The idea of graffiti as practice sketches implies that the incised walls are a space on which experienced artists roughed out designs that might later be painted or sculpted elsewhere. Alternatively, the graffiti results from artists trying out old ideas on a new medium: incised plaster. These possibilities explain why the graffiti are not discrete, well-orga nized compositions: they were not meant to be for mal, finished art. However, only a small portion of the graffiti can be considered practice sketches. Good examples from Tikal and Uaxactun (Figure 3) show multiple attempts at a particular design, probably done by the same artist, with notable Explanation #2: Squatters In 1913,Tozzer (1913:160) claimed that the graf fiti at Nakum were incised by visitors to the site arriving after much of the city was abandoned. At Tikal, the purported squatters arrived after the site's political and demographic collapse in the ninth cen tury. Initially, the graffiti at Tikal "were thought to have been made by the decadent peoples long after [the site] was abandoned" (Webster 1963:38). Allegedly, the squatters had little or no connection to the Classic Maya cultural tradition. This lack of cultural continuity would explain why the graffiti diverge in so many ways from Classic-period art. The example in Figure 4, from the top of the west wall of room 1, structure 5c-13 (the "Bat Palace" west of the Great Plaza between Temples III and IV), was incised in the Postclassic Mixteca-Puebla style, which shows that some of the graffiti indeed diverge from the Classic Maya tradition and unquestionably date to well after the major aban donment of the site. Since most of the graffiti are found on walls of buildings that were never fully sealed, the buildings could have been entered and marked after their original occupation. Based on what Coe (1983:5) calls a "somewhat impressive correlation" between unsealed buildings with graf fiti and the presence of Eznab Phase (A. D. 850-925) ceramics, Kampen (1978) suggested that most of the graffiti in these unsealed buildings were incised in the Terminal Classic as opposed to the Post classic. Oddly, as Kampen noted, the graffiti found in buildings that were sealed prior to the Late Clas sic are quite similar to the graffiti found in struc tures that were never sealed. This similarity and the fact that the pre-Late Classic graffiti were incised</page><page sequence="5">Hutson] GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 407 p tJ Figure 3. Examples of an artist practicing: (a) from Tikal (Trik and Kampen 1983: Figure 69b; courtesy of the Penn Museum; (b) from Uaxactun (after Smith 1950: Figure 113d). Figure 4. Example of Postclassic graffito from Tikal (Trik and Kampen 1983:Figure 16; courtesy of the Penn Museum). well before the proposed arrival of squatters trou ble the idea that all of it was the work of squatters (Haviland and Haviland 1995:305). Kampen antic ipated this criticism by suggesting that the early, sealed structures "received their graffiti as part of the terminal activities associated with their aban donment, desecration, and razing before they were sealed by later constructions" (1978:169). In other words, the early graffiti look like the later graffiti, not because the early graffiti were incised by squat ters, but because they were incised in a context of desecration. Kampen's support for the desecratory context of the early graffiti is that the graffiti are too scattered and disorganized to have been toler ated while the buildings were occupied (Kampen 1978:169). There is no question that some of the graffiti at Tikal postdate the site's collapse. However, one can challenge the notion that all of it was incised by squatters or as part of a desecration (Haviland and Haviland 1995:305). For example, Kampen and</page><page sequence="6">408 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 The pervasiveness of graffiti inscribed in churches still in use as sacred places suggests two things: (1) sacred places are not sacred at all hours, and/or (2) graffiti are not always seen as desecra tory. Sontag's (1987) analysis of Dutch graffiti and Fleming's (2001) analysis of graffiti in Elizabethan England strengthen the latter suggestion. They argue that graffiti were not understood as the aggressive form of vandalism that people perceive today. Graffiti were charming or simply unremarkable—an outlet for representation in a society where paper was scarce—not a menace or mutiny. If a profanation, it was mild enough to be tolerated in solemn and sacred places. Not until the nineteenth century did graffiti come to signify trans gression in Western society. For the Maya, this means that we cannot simply assume that graffiti were desecrations. others have exaggerated the discontinuity between the graffiti and the Maya cultural tradition. The pres ence of glyph blocks and compositions incised in Classic Maya style (Figure 2) demonstrates at least some cultural continuity both at Tikal and at other sites. More importantly, nobody has stated the rea soning behind the assumption that graffiti would not have been tolerated while buildings were occupied. Presumably, the reasoning is that some buildings, for example Tikal's graffiti-laden Temple II, were so sacred that marking them with graffiti would be inconceivable unless the city was already in ruins. Yet cross-cultural comparison exposes this reason ing as ethnocentric and modern. Seventeenth-cen tury Dutch paintings of church interiors show that "space designed for devoutness is fully open to the irreverent accents and mixtures of daily life" (Son tag 1987:126). These exceptionally realistic paint ings of such majestic spaces show graffiti, men loitering, dogs urinating, infants suckling, and occa sionally, children drawing on walls. Gerard Houck geest's Niewe Kerk in Delft with the Tomb of William the Silent, painted in 1650, shows a stick figure and other doodles at the base of a grandiose marble column. Graffiti abundantly adorned fully operating, historic churches and monasteries in Eng land, Scandinavia, and Mexico as well (Blindheim 1985; Jones-Baker 1981; Russo 2006). cent of it was executed by individuals who had entered altered states of consciousness. The pro ponents of this explanation, Haviland and Haviland (1995), follow the argument put forth by Lewis Williams and Dowson in their interpretation of con temporary San and Upper Paleolithic rock art. In their paper, "The Signs of All Times," Lewis Williams and Dowson (1988:202) report that peo ple from various cultures perceive a recurrent set of simple geometric forms while in trance. The most common forms include grids, parallel lines, dots, zig-zags, nested curves, and thin, meander ing lines. These specific forms, called entoptics, derive from the nervous system. Thus "all people who enter certain altered states of consciousness, no matter what their cultural background, are liable to perceive them" (Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988:202). Lewis-Williams and Dowson assert that people in altered states of consciousness progress through three stages of mental imagery. In the first stage, people see only the basic entoptic forms. In the second stage, the brain attempts to make sense of the entoptics by construing them as iconic forms. For example, a yellow circle (entoptic form) may be construed as a lemon (iconic form). In the final stage, the person undergoing trance begins to per ceive iconic images independent of the entoptics, though entoptic forms may persist in the back ground. Lewis Williams and Dowson then show that rock art from Paleolithic Europe as well as from the twentieth-century San of the Kalahari Desert contains images attributable to each of these three stages. Since San rock art was produced by shamans, Lewis-Williams and Dowson suggest that entoptic art from all times depicts imagery that peo ple saw when in trance.The actual depiction would have taken place after trance, once the graffitist regained normal consciousness and a steady hand. Explanation #3: Entoptics The most recent and most innovative explanation of the crudeness of graffiti holds that up to 90 per Haviland and Haviland justify the application of Lewis Williams and Dowson's model to Tikal by noting that "trance experience seems to be a human universal." Helvenston and Bahn (2003) argue that only trance experiences brought about by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, and psylocybine will have the three stages outlined by Lewis-Williams and Dowson. Haviland and Haviland also cite Scheie and Friedel's (1990:65-95) argument that Maya kings were divine shamans who went into trance in order to communicate with supernatural beings. Maya kings</page><page sequence="7">Hutson] GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 409 Figure 5. Graffiti proposed as examples of entoptic art ([a] from Trik and Kampen 1983:Figure 53b; [b] from Trik and Kampen 1983:Figure 10a). Courtesy of the Penn Museum. engaged in these and other activities (warfare with other elites, reenactment of myths, dedication of monuments) that both legitimized their rule and aided their followers. Haviland and Haviland then identify matches between entoptic forms and the graffiti at Tikal. The entoptic argument provides an explanation of the crudity of the Tikal graffiti because Haviland and Haviland (1995:298) con tend that cartoonish or poor images are realistic depictions of what was seen during trance, and that things seen during trance are often distorted to begin with. The entoptic approach taken by Lewis-Williams and Dowson has generated many critiques. First is the problem of knowing whether or not a motif that looks like an entoptic form is an entoptic form. To quote Whitney Davis (1988:222), "it seems diffi cult to distinguish between a stylized iconic repre sentation ... and entoptically derived forms construed representationally" (see also Bradshaw 2003). For example, Figure 5 shows a human fig ure (or perhaps a pair of figures) ascending a pyra mid, shown in profile, with a building at the top. The part of the pyramid that the figures ascend looks like a stairway. Haviland and Haviland iden tify the stairway as a zig-zag entoptic. This would be a second-stage entoptic in which, following Lewis-Williams and Dowson, the nervous system of the person in trance produced a zig zag, the per son then construed the zig zag as a stairway, and finally etched it onto the wall. But in this particu lar example, one can account for the graffito with out recourse to entoptics. In other words, the zig zag makes sense visually, contextually, and func tionally as a stairway (it looks like a stairway, it is on the part of the pyramid where stairways are nor mally found, and it is being used as a stairway [e.g., the anthropomorphic figure(s) climb it]). Explain ing the stairway does not require the proposal that the person who etched it underwent trance. Return ing to Davis's critique, the stairway in the graffito could be a stairway plain and simple, not an entop tic zigzag construed as a stairway. Is there any way to tell when a stairway is just a stairway and when it is an entoptic stairway? I would suggest that the identification of the graffito as an entoptic could be strengthened if there were entoptic forms in non iconic contexts surrounding the stairway. However, there are no other zig-zag motifs in any of the rooms of the building in which the representation of the staircase is found (building 5D-50). A related problem has to do with the fact that the basic entoptic forms—dots, parallel lines, squiggles, zig-zags, grids—are so basic that peo ple who have never undergone trance will have difficulty making a sketch that contains no entop tic forms. In other words, in any art, "there are bound to be lots of marks that look like some or all of the six basic entoptic categories" (Bahn 1988:217). Specifically, almost all of the entoptic</page><page sequence="8">410 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 forms observed in altered states of consciousness are also prominent in children's drawings (Kellogg et al. 1965; Martindale 1988). Because of this prob lem, it is hard to identify something that is not an entoptic (Davis 1988:223). It is therefore not star tling that Haviland and Haviland identify 90 per cent of the Tikal graffiti as trance-related. I believe that Haviland and Haviland have made an excel lent contribution that may account for some of the graffiti, but not as much as 90 percent. passage into adulthood for young Maya subjects. Though all subjects, regardless of age, are always in the process of coming into harmony with aspects of their world, the youngest subjects—the truly "childish"—are still acquiring the most basic dis positions that will eventually make them culturally intelligible people. In fact, I will argue that graffiti represent examples of the process by which chil dren acquire these dispositions—come to terms with the world—and in doing so become people. A final criticism regards what Davis (1988:223) calls syntax and specific morphology. If iconic rep resentations in graffiti are said to result from visions acquired in the second or third stage of trance, then how do we explain the specific form or style in which complex icons are represented? For exam ple, even if the beast depicted in Figure 5b is cor rectly interpreted as a construal of the grid entoptic (Haviland and Haviland 1995:299), this interpre tation does not explain the odd sense of proportion deployed or why the beast's arm is a single line, like a stick figure. Haviland and Haviland note that cultural predilections affect the style of entoptic drawings. However, Maya artistic predilections do not account for appendages drawn as sticks. It could be that appendages were drawn as sticks because that's how the appendages were seen during trance (cf. Haviland and Haviland 1995:298). Yet Faus tich (1988) maintains that this argument puts graf fiti into a black box, a "nervous system determinism" that makes it difficult to understand the creativity, agency, improvisation, and negotia tion that give graffiti and other arts their dynamism. Explanation #4: Children and Graffiti Childhood has begun to receive explicit attention from archaeologists in Mesoamerica (Ardren and Hutson 2006; Joyce 2000) and elsewhere (Baxter 2005b; Kamp 2002; Sofaer Derevenski 2000). This work builds on the notion that children are not an essential category of being (James et al. 1998), nor are they essentially different from adults (Hutson 2006). Rather, childhood is defined differently in various cultures and historical periods. Bishop Diego de Landa's ethnohistoric account of the six teenth-century Yucatec Maya indicates that both girls and boys underwent a series of ceremonies that divided young people's lives into several stages of being (Joyce 2000; Tozzer 1941:102; Trachman and Valdez 2006). Marriage represented the final The idea that children incised Maya graffiti was first articulated by Edward H. Thompson and George Dorsey (1898:226), who, commenting on graffiti at Xkichmook, Yucatan, stated that "the work does not seem to be of a serious or signifi cant nature, but rather the random effort of some young idler, who used his flint or obsidian knife with the same disregard of parental warnings that characterizes the modern youth wielding his keen edged jack-knife." Sir J. Eric S. Thompson (1954:10), who thought the graffiti resulted from the "doodling" of "bored or inattentive novices," made an equally colorful argument. During a visit to Tikal in the early 1920s Thompson was intrigued by the "crude sketches" on the walls of a room in the central acropolis. Lying in a hammock, remi niscing on his own schoolboy caricatures,Thomp son declared, "this must have been the building in which the Maya novices were before initiation at some great ceremony" (1954:11). Though I believe that children did indeed pro duce some of the graffiti at Tikal and elsewhere, J. E. S. Thompson's account has flaws. The idea that the graffiti were incised as part of initiation does not account for the fact that graffiti have been observed on an extraordinarily wide variety of buildings: residences, storerooms, temples, etc. Furthermore, it does not seem likely that initiates would be housed in such an exhaustive assortment of places, nor in particular locales that have graf fiti such as the king's own quarters (structure 5D-46) or Temple II (structure 5D-2), which is at the top of a staircase rising 22 m above the Great Plaza. Beyond the specific problems with Thompson s (1954) account, two issues call for attention. First, nobody has presented compelling evidence to sup port the argument that children produced graffiti. In the next section, I address this shortcoming by exploring analogies and contextual details that</page><page sequence="9">Hutson] jRAFFITI OF TIKAL 111 strengthen the argument that children incised some jf the crude graffiti. Second, those who attribute :he graffiti to children dismiss them as paltry dis tractions. For example, Smith (1950:83), who regarded the graffiti at Uaxactun as "the scratch ing of children," stated: "The subject matter needs no description as the reproductions are self sxplanatory." Rather than neglecting explanation, 1 will take graffiti seriously because they serve as a basis for inferences about socialization and the learning process. Vlortensen 1991:22). Disproportional renderings nay index not a lack of skill, but a cultural assess ment of the importance of the things portrayed dis iroportionally. Lhildren and Drawing some Maya graftiti exhibit aspects that have long been known to characterize the drawings of young :hildren from various cultures. Several authors have argued that as children grow, they pass through predictable stages in a progression from scribbling to complex compositions (Gardner 1980; Golomb 2002:31-33; Kellogg 1969; Mortensen 1991; Shatil 1995; Thomas and Silk 1990). When given a writing instrument and a writing surface for the first time, young children tend to scribble (see Kellogg 1969 for types of scribble). The first advance beyond scribbling is the circle and other simple designs like squares, crosses, and triangles (Kellogg 1969; Shatil 1995:xvii-xx). The first attempts to draw the body as a whole usually results in the "tadpole": a face to which limbs are directly attached (Figure 6a) (Freeman 1975; Golomb 2002:19). Other early attempts to draw bodies result in open-trunk figures, which consist of two paral lel legs descending from the head and arms branch ing directly from the legs (Figure 6b). With a single horizontal line connecting the legs, open-trunk fig ures can give way to closed trunk figures (Figure 6c, 6i). Stick figures are also common in early attempts to represent bodies (6d, 6g). Many stick figures have a closed trunk (Figure 6e). Composi tions next become more realistic: fingers may be added to the end of the arm (Thomas and Silk 1990:38), though the number of fingers may not be anatomically correct (see Figure 6e). Eventu ally, the appendages cease to be single lines and take the form of shaped volumes (Figure 6f) (Alland 1983:15; Golomb 2002:22). Also, chil dren's early representations of humans often ren der the head disproportionately large compared to the rest of the body (Figure 6h) (Golomb 2002:10; The above regularities in the development of :hildren's art were first documented by researchers working with European schoolchildren at the end the nineteenth century. Since then, a series of studies of children's drawings from all over the world have uncovered some of the same features and trends (Alland 1983; Belo 1955; Paget 1932). Though cognitive ability and motor skills develop in predictable ways in all cultures, certainly there is cultural variation (Crown 2001:457). For exam ple, Deregowski (1980) notes that drawings of humans by Tallensi and San children usually lack enclosed shapes, thus challenging the importance of the circle in the development of drawing. Nev ertheless, Fortes (1940), who elicited the Tallensi drawings, documented some of the same trends seen in Western children's art: scribbling followed by stick figures and stick figures with incorrect numbers of digits (Figure 6g). Thus, cross-cultural aspects or children s draw ings coexist with local conventions. Two studies from Bali strengthen this point. Jane Belo (1955) showed that although Balinese children age five or older produced human figures with the character istics of Balinese shadow puppets, children age three to four produced figures similar to children's art from many other cultures: fat, round heads with stick legs (Figure 6h). Using more tightly con trolled methods of observation, Alland (1983) elicited drawings from Balinese children in which both Balinese and universal aspects of inexperi enced art coexist. These drawings filled up the whole page and featured multiple colors (children's drawing from Micronesia [Figure 6i], one of Alland's other study areas, used only one color), both of which are characteristic of local Balinese art. Yet when the children drew humans, they pro duced tadpoles and stick figures, always dispro portionally rendered. Thus, despite cultural variation, "the dominant impression is of a uni versal graphic language clearly recognizable to the student of child art, a language whose basic gram mar allows for variations on a common underly ing structure" (Golomb 2002:87).

In other words, what accounts for the crude yet formulaic features in Figure 6? One of the most prominent answers is expressed in Jean Piaget's work on the cognitive development of intelligence in children. Piaget (Piaget and Inhelder 1969) argued that children's drawings are a direct measure of how children see the world. From this perspective, if a child draws a stick figure, the child does not yet see the world correctly. A lack of realism in drawings thus reflects</page><page sequence="11">Hutsonj GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 413 A second criticism ot the developmental approach is that perception differs from represen tation. A child can perceive spatial relations cor rectly but not know how to draw them (Thomas and Silk 1990:31). Drawing a scene requires not only an understanding of the geometry and spatial relations of the scene, but a set of two-dimensional forms that allows translation of three-dimensional visions into a two-dimensional medium (Golomb 2002:17). If crude drawings indicate poor drawing skills as opposed to an incompletely developed mind, adults with little or no experience in draw ing should produce images that look just like those of young children. Wilson and Wilson (1977:6) confirmed this expectation while researching elders who had not drawn since early childhood and whose lives gave them little exposure to "config urational sign making." When asked to draw humans, the elders drew tadpoles no different from those produced by four-year-olds (see also Dere gowski 1980:176). For this reason, tadpoles, stick figures, and the like should not be called children's art. They are the art of beginners, whether young or old (see also Bagwell 2002; Kamp 2001a: 13). I will therefore use the adjective "beginner" to refer to this kind of graffiti and "experienced" to refer to graffiti that exhibits fully developed Maya con ventions. an underdeveloped mind. As their minds mature, children understand more about spatial relations and produce more accurate drawings. has argued that since representing is a very differ ent task than perceiving, drawing pictures for the first time requires starting from scratch and invent ing two-dimensional shapes and forms that stand in for three dimensional objects (see also Dere gowski 1980:176). Unable to represent complex figures, the beginner falls back on simple shapes like circles, dots, and lines and then must devise ways of combining them. Tadpoles and stick fig ures are an expected result of first attempts to pro duce a pictorial representation from limited forms and skills. In sum, the cross-cultural similarity of children's art arises because "in every generation the child invents a basic vocabulary of universally similar and meaningful shapes" (Golomb 2002:18). Yet, as noted above, the basic forms are always improvised in the cultural context of local tradi tions. Moreover, Arnheim's perspective explains similarities between the art of children and the art of untrained adults. In this it echoes Franz Boas's comment, "Just like the child, the would-be artist is confronted with a task for which he lacks tech nical preparation, and many of the difficulties that beset the child beset him also" (1955:65 [1927]). A major criticism of the developmental approach is that the goal of representation is not always to depict the world in the most realistic way possible. Anthropologists such as Boas (1955) and Fortes (1940) have suggested that disproportion alities, such as when a head is drawn larger than it should be, are not failed attempts at realism. Rather, they convey cultural notions of the symbolic impor tance of certain body parts. The history of art in diverse cultures indicates that an accurate, realis tic rendering of the world is not the universal end point of artistic development (Golomb 2002:4). In light or the critique or the developmental approach, a "processual" (Arnheim 1966) approach is more successful in explaining the cross-cultural regularities of beginner's art. Unlike the develop mental approach, the processual approach focuses &gt;n drawing as process as opposed to drawings as finished products. Rudolf Arnheim (1966, 1974) Beginners at Tikal Returning to Tikal, many graffiti exhibit charac teristics of beginner's drawing (see Figure 7). We would not expect the graffiti in Figure 7 to look exactly like the drawings in Figure 6 because chil dren's art takes on culturally distinct styles at an early age. However, certain characteristics are shared. For example, Figure 7a was incised with an open-trunk. Some figures with closed trunks have appendages represented by single lines, much like stick figures (Figure 7b, c, d). Many of these graffiti lack the appropriate number of fingers (Fig ure 7c and 5b). Many walls that have iconic forms incised on them also have a series of errant lines that do not fit with the iconic graffiti. Though it is hard to judge, two graffiti on the wall of structure 5d-61 might be tadpole versions of humans (Fig ure 7e). The lines in Figure 7f might be scribbles. Disproportionality is quite common. In the most severe cases, the heads are drawn too large, as vis ible in Figure 8. However, following Boas (1955:69-70), the practice of exaggerating the size of the head can be explained as an attempt to direct attention toward the anatomical traits that the</page><page sequence="12">414 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 7. Examples of inexperienced graffiti from Tikal (from Trik and Kampcn,1983: Figures 27i, 36b, 4, 53c, 63, and 59a; courtesy of the Penn Museum). ancient Maya considered most striking or most important: Houston and Stuart's reading of the bah morpheme in Maya hieroglyphics suggests that the head is the supreme locus of selfhood and personal identity (1998:77). Following the processual approach, I argue that beginner's features (including but not limited to open-trunk figures, stick figures, incorrect numbers of fingers) in Maya graffiti have to do with inex perience in representation. Beginner's graffiti are not necessarily children's graffiti. They may also be the work of inexperienced adults. However, an additional line of data—the height of the graffiti on the wall —may help determine the age of the artists. Adult height varies, but on average, within any given society, higher graffiti should index a taller and therefore older subject. If grown-ups do not stoop down to incise graffiti, graffiti closer to the floor could index a shorter and therefore younger subject. However, graffiti that is close to the floor could have been done by seated grown ups. The location of several graffiti just above benches supports the idea that people sometimes sat down when they incised graffiti. Thus, if graffiti are found low on the wall it is not necessarily the work of the young. However, graffiti high above the floor is likely to be the work of adults or adult-sized teenagers since only they could reach high. If the beginners' graffiti are located high above the floor, out of reach of children, then the grounds for attributing this graffiti to children weaken. Determining the range of drawing heights for adults requires data on adult stature. Poor preser vation of bones muddies the issue: of the roughly 200 burials unearthed by the University of Penn sylvania project, Haviland (1967) obtained stature estimates for 55 individuals (stature estimates for the burials uncovered by the more recent Proyecto Nacional Tikal have not been published). Haviland reports an average stature of 1.67 m for males dur ing the Early Classic (n = 15), 1.57 m for males dur ing the Late Classic (n = 21), and 1.47 m for females</page><page sequence="13">nuisonj UHArrl M OP TIKAL 415 Figure 8. Graffiti with disproportionally enlarged heads (from TVik and Kampen 1983: Figure 47a; courtesy of the Penn Museum). from all periods (n = 19). Assuming that the center of a graffito should be slightly below eye level, and that a standing adult can comfortably reach 40 cm above or below that center, graffiti composed by standing adults at Tikal should be between 1.1 and 1.9 m above floor level. Graffiti incised by young people should be lower than this. Beginner's graffiti are usually found lower than the height range of a standing grown-up. The aver age midpoint of the least-skilled graffiti, which exhibit features described above for beginner's drawings (see, for example, figures 7 a-e), is .88 m above the floor (Figure 11).1 The highest of these is 1.36 m above the floor: the top of this Figure would be in reach of a child standing 4 feet tall. In contrast, the most experienced examples are at dif ferent heights. Experienced graffiti include glyphs, well-composed scenes (such as the ballcourt land scape in rigure 46 ot Tnk and Kampen 1983), and images of humans, animals, or deities whose bio logical features and/or clothing/adornments resem ble art from canonical sculpture and painting (see, for example, Figures 2a, 4a, 4b, and at the top of 9; probable Postclassic examples, such as Figure 3, were left out of the calculations). Of the 45 expe rienced graffiti for which confirmed data on height and context were available,2 the average height of the centerpoint is 1.33 m above the floors (n = 34) or benches (n = 11) (see Figure 11). Sixteen of these have their centerpoints 1.6 m above the floor or higher, and therefore beyond the reach of chil dren. Some of the advanced graffiti are within a meter of the floor, but these could have been incised by adults sitting down. The average center of com position for the rest of the graffiti, which are not skilled but probably not the work of a beginner, is</page><page sequence="14">416 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 9.

In sum, the fact that the best examples of beginner's graf fiti are within the reach of children, while some experienced graffiti are found only within reach of adults, supports the idea that children could have made some of the beginner's graffiti. Finally, examining the relative heights of the graffiti also helps address the question of the age of the graffitist. In those cases where beginners' graffiti are part of large clusters of graffiti, they often appear below examples of graffiti that show</page><page sequence="15">Hutson] GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 417 Figure 10. Graffiti in which upper figures display more skill than lower figures ([al from Trik and Kampen 1983 Figure 6; [b] from Trik and Kampen 1983 Figure 43c courtesy of the Penn Museum). more skill. Figure 9 fits this pattern, as do Figures 10a and 10b, as well as Trik and Kampen's Figures 4,9, and 31c. Only Figure 11 and Figure 35 of Trik and Kampen reverse this pattern. Thus, inexperi enced graffiti usually underlie experienced graffiti. This phenomenon matches what one would expect if young children incised the inexperienced graf fiti on the bottom and older children or grown-ups, whose height made them most comfortable with the higher registers, incised the more experienced graffiti at the top. This scenario calls to mind obser vations of younger children drawing on lower por tions of walls and older children using the upper portions of the same walls in late nineteenth-cen tury Italy (Ricci 1877 cited in Golomb 2002), or the nineteenth-century Self Portrait painted by J.J. Grandville (Figure 13). Learning in Community As discussed above, a major shortcoming in the work of authors who identify graffiti as the work of children is that these authors neglect to consider what the graffiti reveals about the experience of childhood. Whereas Thompson (1954:10) dis missed the graffiti as the product of boredom, I argue in this section that the graffiti reveal an active engagement in the world and in communities of practice. The lack of artistic experience manifested in the graffiti enables an examination of topics that are central to processes of subjectification: learn ing and socialization. Getting at these topics requires going beyond style and getting into con text, content, and why people incised this graffiti in the first place. Though these concerns some times lend themselves to speculation, they carry the excitement of delving into a view of the world rarely expressed in the canonical art of the time. In summary, it appears that some of the skilled examples of graffiti at Tikal, the only site with a large sample of graffiti with published height mea surements, could only have been done by taller people. The crude, beginners' examples are lower on the wall, suggesting that they were done by children or seated grown-ups with little artistic experience. I begin with the graffiti on the east wall of room 2 in structure 3d-40, on the east side of plaza at the north end of the Maler Causeway. Structure 3d-40 has two vaulted rooms on top of an 8 m high plat form (Loten 2002; Shook 1956) and was excavated</page><page sequence="16">418 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 2.5 m experienced graffiti 2.0 m 1.5 m 1.0 m .5 m Figure 11. Box and whisker plots of the height of the cen terpoints of beginner graffiti and experienced graffiti. in 1984-85 under the direction of Jorge Mario de Leon, though Laporte (2001) notes that the exca vations have not yet been reported. Figure 9 shows an example of a quadruped at the top of the wall, approximately 1.75 m above the floor (see Loten 2002, Figure 2 for a section that establishes the height of the graffiti). The beast has a long tail, men acing claws, pointed ears, spotted fur, and a fero cious, open mouth showing pointy teeth. Though the snout seems more canine than feline, the claws and the spotted fur provide strong grounds for iden tification as a jaguar. Forty to 90 cm below are three figures, showing features of beginners' art, which imitate the jaguar above: the one to the right has the signature ears and quadruped posture; the one in the center has the ears, spotted pelt, and teeth; the one at the left has one ear and the teeth. All three of the figures in the bottom row cite the experienced jaguar graffito at the top of the same wall via direction, posture, and the ferocious mouth. A few meters away, another wall of the same room contains as many as nine incised figures with this same ferocious mouth. Three of them have other characteristics of jaguars. The other six are com pletely indistinct with the exception of the mouth. Several felines also appear on the walls of room 1 of structure 3d-40. Though they were incised at dif ferent scales, all are smaller than life-size. The jaguar was "probably the most feared and revered beast in Mesoamerica" (Miller and Taube 1993:102). The fact that the prominent trait seen in the graffiti—the ferocious mouth—happens to be the most dangerous trait of actual jaguars attests to the artist's understanding of their deadly power. One of the most interesting features of the jaguars in Figure 9 is that they exhibit different lev els of skill. The creator of the jaguar at the top of the wall had much more experience than whoever was responsible for the figures at the bottom. I argue that the creator of the jaguar at the top (about 1.75 m above the floor) was also older and taller than the graffitists who used the lower portion of the wall. This explains why the more experienced art is higher on the wall. The same instance of a grown person using a wall's upper register and a youngster using the lower register is seen in the nineteenth-century Self Portrait painted by J.J. Grandville (Figure 13). Unfortunately, since Trik and Kampen reproduce the Tikal graffiti as line drawings, it is not possible to determine whether children's graffiti lower on the wall were incised less deeply than the jaguar at the top of the wall. The author of the lowest of the animals (Figure 5a) used a grid pattern as opposed to small circles to represent the jaguar's spotted pelt. For a young child it might have been easier to use longer, straight lines, as opposed to small circles, to represent the pelt: incising small circles into hard plaster may have required a combination of strength and motor control not yet possessed by young children (see also Kamp 2001b:428). Yet the choice to use a grid does not show that age or physical ability deter mines an aspect of art because the graffitist could also have chosen to fill in the pelt with parallel lines or broad scribbles, each of which would have been just as easy from a technical standpoint.</page><page sequence="17">HutsonJ GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 419 Figure 12. Graffiti from west wall of Temple II, Tikal (from Trik and Kampen, 1983: Figure 34; courtesy of the Penn Museum). Though the artists used different methods to represent pelts, other details of the upper and lower figures suggest that the younger and older graffi ti sts in structure 3d-40 were copying each other. All of the creatures in Figure 9 look to the right and extend a limb to the right. Copying also occurs among the 14 renditions of pyramids found in Tem ple II (Structure 5d-2-lst, located on the west side of the Tikal's Great Plaza). The eight pyramids incised onto the west interior wall of Temple II (Figure 12) exhibit different skill levels. In the pyra mid at the far left the graffitist has correctly por trayed the tiered nature of Tikal temples but has misrepresented the vertical proportions of the tiers, has not stacked the tiers evenly, and has failed to keep lines within their bounds. In the pyramid at the far right, the vertical proportions of the pyra mid are accurate, the tiers are evenly stacked, and the lines end closer to their bounds. Juxtaposing the two pyramids gives an example of a less-expe rienced graffitist emulating the work of a more experienced graffitist, or, alternatively, the skilled hand showing the lesser hand a better version. The jaguars and pyramids recall several documented examples of joint participation in art projects in which a younger (less-skilled) graffitist imitates an older (more skilled) graffitist (Alland 1983:47-50; Belo 1955; Paget 1932). If the different images on the same wall overlapped, it might be possible to tell which design came first. However, these and other designs I have discussed (e.g., figures 9 and 10) do not overlap, and if they did, the line draw ings inTrik and Kampen (1983) do not allow deter mination of patterns of superposition. Most important from a social perspective, the multiple versions of jaguars and temples document the remains of a community of practice in which people of different ages and skills participated in the same activity. Though children who attend school in large, postindustrial communities are</page><page sequence="18">420 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 Figure 13. Self Portrait, by J J. Grandville, from Cent Proverbes, 1844. often segregated into strict age grades, children in many preindustrial societies often spend time with people of a broad range of ages (Gottleib 2004:141). Insofar as one person's attempt at a jaguar or pyramid is copied from, or serves as the motivation for, another person's attempt, learning is intersubjective and reciprocal (Jackson 1998:10), regardless of which design (skilled or less skilled) was first incised onto the wall. Crown (2001; see also Kamp 2001b) provides compelling evidence of such a learning process as seen in Hohokam and Mimbres pottery. Not only do adults provide pots for children to decorate (and, on Mimbres pots, ghost lines for children to follow), they team up with children to paint individual pots. Intersubjective learning frameworks can be quite varied, ranging from observation and imita tion to formal, hands-on lessons with verbal instruc tion (Crown 2001:456; DeBoer 1990; Kamp 2001b:428; Wallaert-Petre 2001). In contexts where inexperienced artists incised images that resemble those of experienced artists (or vice versa) at Tikal, we are not certain how actively the advanced artists would have been teaching. In con trast to the Mimbres case (Crown 2001), in which children and adults shared in painting the same pot and adults provided ghost lines for children, there is in fact no way of knowing whether multiple peo ple were actually incising graffiti in the same room at the same time. Nevertheless, even if there was never more than one graffitist working at a time, this one graffitist would still have been working as Figure 14. Graffito from Tikal (Trik and Kampen 1983: Figure 9; courtesy of the Penn Museum). part of a community because his/her work would have been in dialogue with other people's work already on the wall. As a younger child acquires from older people the established ways of perceiving and represent ing the world, she comes into harmony with these conventions and with a way of being that makes her culturally intelligible to others (Bourdieu 1977; Taylor 1999). In this sense, learning and the for mation of identity intermingle (Lave and Wenger 1991:115). The fact that learning how to picture the world involved multiple graffitists in Structure 3d-40 and Temple II foregrounds Lave and Wenger's 1991 view of learning not as absorbing knowledge but as participating in a community of practice. In this view, learning to engage in rela tionships with actors of various ages is just as important, if not more so, than learning how to make pictures. Why Incise Graffiti? In this section, I discuss some explanations of graf fiti that supplement those mentioned above, such as the shamanic trance argument. For many con temporary urbanites, graffiti brings transgression to mind. Yet the forefathers of contemporary graf fiti, who began painting New York City subway cars in the 1970s, did graffiti not necessarily to rebel, as municipal authorities contended, but to</page><page sequence="19">Hutson] GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 421 "get up": to get exposure by placing their names and their art all over the city (Silver and Chalfant 1983). Though far removed from the ancient Maya, the desire to get up expresses a sentiment that likely resonates with all cultures that con template mortality: the possibility of asserting one's existence in a way that extends the self beyond the physical person in both space and time. Houston and Stuart (1998) have shown that cer tain Maya art, such as stone stelae, functioned pre cisely to extend the royal self. Did the non-royal Maya produce graffiti out of a similar desire to leave their mark and extend their subjectivity? ing the spectator gigantic in comparison. With miniatures, "knowledge of the whole precedes knowledge of the parts and this gratifies the intel ligence" (Bailey 2005:33). By improving under standing of the thing represented, miniatures bring security and pleasure. Experiments performed by De Long (1983) complement these observations: when attending to smaller things in smaller envi ronments, people are more alert and can process more information. The mention of twentieth-century subways retreads the issue of graffiti as a desecration. Though research on graffiti in other historical contexts (Blindheim 1985; Jones-Baker 1981; Russo 2006; Sontag 1987) shows that it is unsafe to assume graf fiti are a desecration, it is hard to resist the idea that people snuck into temples or other structures and furtively left their marks. The argument that graf fiti was a kind of protest may indeed work for Tikal, but looking at the specific content of the graffiti allows other explanations. Research on children's drawings has explored the motivations for leaving marks. Many explanations for why children draw, such as drawing as a way of releasing surplus energy (Thomas and Silk 1990:60), are plausible for the case of Maya graffiti but don't attend to the speci ficity of the graffiti's content. An explanation that makes sense of some of the specific themes of Maya graffiti and some of their contexts is that art is a realm in which children re create the world in a miniaturized form that they can control. This operation, known as mastery play, allows children to take a situation in which they were powerless or confused and re-create it in such a way that they can reassert mastery, bringing con flict, fright, confusion, etc. to a comfortable reso lution (Bruner 1972; Elliott 1994; Erickson 1968:351; Freud 1950;Jackson 1998;Piaget 1976). In The Savage Mind, Claude Levi-Strauss discusses how miniaturization facilitates mastery play. He argues that reducing the scale of an item reduces the item's formidability. Miniaturization "extends and diversifies our power over a homologue of the thing, and by means of it the latter can be grasped, assessed and apprehended at a glance" (1966:23; see also Darling 1998). More recently, Bailey has argued that miniatures empower spectators by mak Mastery play—the idea that people assert psy chological mastery over difficulties in the real world by manipulating miniature representations of the world—fits many details of the graffiti dis cussed above. Did people incise miniature jaguars in order to come to terms with such a fearsome, overpowering aspect of the natural environment? The deference paid to the jaguar in Maya culture stems from the jaguar's close connection with the sun as well as the notion that the jaguar was a co essence of kings (Houston and Stuart 1989). The night-time sun, known as the Jaguar God of the Underworld, was heavily revered at Tikal (Miller and Taube 1993:104). Did the act of depicting jaguars in miniature give children the security and power to cope with a natural and supernatural beast beyond their control? Did children accomplish the more basic task of coming to terms with parts of their world by incising them in miniature? These questions foreground the point that play is part of the process of socialization (Kamp 2001a: 19); it helps children master basic relations that establish the preconditions for being in the world (see also Huizinga 1950). Dismissing graffiti as forbidden fun fails to account for the specific content of the graffiti and fails to recognize that play makes chil dren culturally intelligible as people. The pyramid graffiti in Temple II, estimated to have stood 39.5 meters tall (Coe 1990, Figure 265b), may also make children intelligible as Maya. Reaching up to 65 m high, the pyramids of Tikal were the largest features of the landscape. Pyramids are also symbolically imposing given that they rep resent sacred mountains; the openings to the tem ples on their tops have been considered the maw of the cosmic monster—the entrance to the under world (Scheie and Freidel 1990). If depicting jaguars mitigated feelings of powerlessness toward the most terrifying element of the natural environ ment, did depicting pyramids in miniature allow</page><page sequence="20">422 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 4, 2011 people to cope with the most imposing element or the built environment? less variation in the finished products. Crown s Mimbres case study shows that when children have both a freer hand in painting pots as well as an abun dance of well-painted models for stimulation, an explosion of innovative compositions can result. The Mimbres ceramic sequence was characterized by rapid changes in designs. Creativity and lntersubjectivity 1 have not yet noted that the multiple versions ot jaguars and pyramids are not simple copies. The spotted pelts of some of the jaguars are achieved not with multiple circles (the established conven tion in Maya art), but with grids (Figure 9, lower left) or by polygons (Figure 14). Likewise, one of the representations of the pyramids seen in Figure 12 (the middle pyramid in the upper row) is repre sented from a bird's-eye view as opposed to a pro file view like the rest. Perhaps the bird's-eye view represents how the temple would have looked from the top, which is precisely the vantage point that the artists would have had while incising these graf fiti at the top of Temple II. These departures from convention—polygonal pelts, bird's eye views prompt the idea that the graffiti allowed for cre ativity (see also Baxter 2005a:32-34). Research on children's songs and games shows that chil dren's activities can be a source of creative, and sometimes ribald, transformations of mainstream cultural traditions and conventions. For example, in British children's lore, Iona Opie (1993:11-12) found that "adults were astonished and horrified that children possessed such an extensive under world culture of their own." I hough it is not possible to confirm the precise source of creativity behind the aberrant ways in which pyramids and jaguars were represented in the graffiti of Tikal, it is possible to state the con ditions in which creativity may or may not flour ish. It was once thought that untrained artists were inherently creative. Those who had not yet been instructed in conventions of representation,such as young children, were said to "possess deeply rooted internal impulses which have only to be nurtured to a glorious unfolding" (Wilson and Wilson 1977:5). Actual studies show that artists with few models make the worst art and that virtually all chil dren's drawings are imitations of already existing images (Wilson and Wilson 1977). Thus, creativ ity does not arise from first-time artists unencum bered by models of how to draw. Nevertheless, Crown (2001; see also DeBoer 1990; Wallaert Petre 2001) has argued that "when transmission is care fully guided by a skilled teacher, there tends to be The intersubjective domain in which some of the graffiti were incised certainly resembles the kind of learning situation documented by Crown. When beginners and those with more experience work and play together informally in a society with rich artistic traditions, such as at Tikal, this creates a fruitful context for innovation. People with dif ferent levels of skill at different ages produce dif ferent versions of the same subject matter. Though differences in versions may not be intentional, con ventions of representation get reproduced differ ently in the process. Since participation is shared, the old timers may adopt these outcomes as inno vations (Lave and Wenger 1991:117). The old timer is influenced by the beginner just as the latter is by the former in the continuity of interaction (see also Mayall 1994:7-8; Scott 1997:7). According to Gid dens (1979:139), "the unfolding of childhood is not time elapsing just for the child: it is time elapsing for its parental figures, and for all other members of society; the socialization involved is not simply that of the child, but of the parents and others with whom the child is in contact, and whose conduct is influenced by the child just as the latter's is by theirs in the continuity of interaction." Though it would be extremely difficult to pinpoint an aspect of canonical art that owes its origins to child's play, Giddens's quote nevertheless suggests that chil dren contribute to changes in linguistic or cultural preferences in society as a whole (e .g., Crown 2001; Smith 2005). Conclusion In this paper I explored the cruder examples of Tikal graffiti and argued that many are crude not necessarily because the authors were squatters lack ing familiarity with Classic period Maya culture, but because they were authored by people with lit tle artistic experience. The positioning of the cruder examples of graffiti on lower parts of walls sug gests that some of those with little artistic experi 2nce were children. This conclusion complements</page><page sequence="21">Hutson] GRAFFITI OF TIKAL 423 rather than replaces other explanations of the crude ness of graffiti. In the end, no single explanation can account for all graffiti, and some graffiti may never be satisfactorily understood. However, to conclude that even a small portion of the graffiti was incised by children is important because it per mits discussion of a group of people whose expe riences are rarely considered in archaeology. for an a priori division of actors into adults and chil dren. This is a felicitous closing point: while asso ciating children with the art of becoming, I have at the same time hoped to avoid implying that only children—not older people—are engaged in the process of becoming. By nature of their position in interconnected networks of places, things and other people, all subjects are prone to becoming. It is the scope and texture of the network, not an inner essence of the people caught up in it, that differ entiates one person from another. Paying attention to content and form of the crude graffiti reveals the social relations in the context of graffiti production and suggests why some of it was incised to begin with. Graffiti involve imagi nation and fantasy but also formative interactions between people, places, and things. Thus, although the word "graffiti" may call to the minds of con temporary readers an aggressive and rebellious defamation, graffiti should not be seen solely as resistance to authority. Incising graffiti is not sim ply a negative reaction to social norms. In the process of incising graffiti, people undergo forms of socialization and accommodation that put them in harmony with norms and contribute to their ongoing development as culturally intelligible per sons (Bourdieu 1977). When a child incises a beast in the likeness of the jaguar already incised higher up on the same wall, more is at stake than simply learning how to draw a jaguar. The child comes to terms with a dan gerous force that is both symbolically and naturally formidable. In learning to coexist with this ferocious beast the child accepts and reiterates a cultural dis course about jaguars. In doing so, she becomes intel ligible to other people. The format of learning is equally important: copying someone else's repre sentation of a jaguar integrates individuals with groups, making them competent and active mem bers of a community. Yet the actual form of the copied images, whether a jaguar or a pyramid, reveals that they are not identical copies. The absence of fidelity between the original graffito and the new design may simply result from a lack of skill but these new designs also show creativity that could be the basis for change in artistic traditions. Thinking more broadly, I would like to stress that the relations between younger people and older people, beasts, and buildings are "two-way": chil dren are formed through their relations with others just as others are formed through their relations with children. This perspective promotes the point that biological age should not always be used as grounds Acknowledgments. This paper took shape as a result of friendly comments and questions from many. I thank two audiences in Washington, D.C. (the Pre-Columbian Society and Dumbarton Oaks) and the participants in a 2008 World Archaeology Congress symposium organized by Traci Ardren and Mike Lally. Elizabeth Boone, Byron Hamann, Leonardo Lopez Lujan, Sven Ouzman, Saburo Sugiyama, Nawa Sugiyama, and two anonymous reviewers gave me particularly helpful suggestions. I thank Laurie Wilkie and Rosemary Joyce for supportive comments at the very begin ning of this project. Finally, I thank Joanne Pillsbury for her unwavering encouragement as I completed the core of this paper while in residence at Dumbarton Oaks as a Fellow in Pre-Columbian Studies.
