<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 309 While the book is remarkable in many ways for its modern outlook and approach, it remains overlaid with much that is characteristically archaic, anthropomorphic and even sentimental. Metaphors such as the following are not uncommon. " In the middle of all sits Sun enthroned. In this most beautiful temple could we place this luminary in any better position... ?" Yet there is one celebrated passage in which the idea of universal gravitation " seems to have hovered before the mind of this great man ", and there are many in which strong emphasis is laid upon the essentially relative character of the celestial motions. Thus he argues, "And why not grant that the diurnal rotation is only apparent in the Heavens but real in the Earth? It is but as the saying of Aeneas in Virgil-' We sail forth from the harbour, and lands and cities retire.' As the ship floats along in the calm, all external things seem to have the motion that is really that of the ship, while those within the ship feel that they and all its contents are at rest ". He explains that " Circular motion ... may be combined with the rectilinear-just as a creature may be at once animal and horse ". Copernicus sets out to refute the traditional arguments against the helio- centric theory and we find in one place the prescient suggestion: " Let us then leave to the Physicists the question whether the Universe be finite or no, holding only to this that Earth is finite and spherical." The writing throughout breathes a spirit of humility, reverence and awe. In the preface addressed to Pope Paul III he explains his reluctance to have the volume published on account of the " novelty and incongruity " of his theory; having " kept it in store not for nine years only, but to a fourth period of nine years " he finally yielded to the persuasion of his friends. Printed originally as Occasional Notes of the Royal Astronomical Society, the pamphlet under review is an example of fine and graceful scholarship. The brief extracts quoted above will serve to convey the quality of the trans- lation from the Latin; a valuable feature is the annotation which is very full and informative. The excellence of the printing, reproductions and illus- trations is outstanding in these days of austerity and the booklet is in every respect up to the high standard of the Society's publications. T. A. BROWT. Surveying instruments, their history and class-room use. By E. R. KEILY. Pp. 411. N.p. 1947. Nineteenth Yearbook of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (525 West 120th Street, New York, 27) "Measurement ", says an Irish poet and writer ", is only a matter of men's prying into the secrets of nature ", and he implies that it is symbolic of " the fall from heaven to earth, which is half the fall of Lucifer ". Brother Edmond R. Kiely, of the Christian Brothers of Ireland, however, invites us to reflect or the romance of measurement. He has had experience in high school and junior engineering mathematics, and from this background he presents a wealth of historical material, which, hitherto, has not been readily available. He then proceeds to adapt the elementary portions to actual mathematical class-room use. If we could only write the history of science with the same accuracy as the orbit of Neptune, then indeed we should have a science of history. The risings and settings of Venus can be calculated backwards to show us when Amnizaduga lived but the science of history does not rest on such a sure foundation. Much of the story of early invention and development of mechan- isms and processes in surveying is necessarily lost beyond recall. Petzval, for instance, produced his prescriptions but his calculations will always be wrapped up in mystery. Nevertheless, this work is an attractive attempt to compress into 237 pages the history of surveying instruments throughout about thirty-two centuries. The Romance of Measurement is here portrayed</page><page sequence="2">THE MATHEMATICAL GAZETTE for the m-an who has to work mentally at such a pace that he has no time left to think about the romance. We are told that the earliest Babylonian map tablet dates back to about 2500 B.C. The beginnings of surveying are de- scribed, in Egypt, China and Babylonia; then the developments in Greece and Rome are dealt with, next the contributions of medieval Europe, Islam and India, and finally the advances made in Europe during the Renaissance. The instrtunents discussed are the working tools ofa craftsman---the level, plumb rule and right angle or square. Then there are the Astrolabes, Quadrants and Staff combinations, with the emlphasis on their use in surveying rather than in &lt;stronomy and astrology. Apparently there are about 300 astrolabes in the Itifferent museums of Europe, from 2 inch to 2 feet diameter. Special markings were used on Muslini instruments to indicate the times of prayer: if the length of the meridian shadow is x, then the beginning of late afternoon prayer occurs when the length of the shadow is 2x. Geometric squares and quadrants are also described and on p. 80 an Arabic quadrant is shown. There is a clear picture of Tychro Btrahe's quadrant, sighted from the centre and showing the shadow square and the revolution of the vertical plane to give the azimuth. Vernier's adaption of his reading device to the quadrant is (lescribed on p). 176--7 alln also in French in the appendix. Despite the fal.ct that Vernier's (escription is dated 1631, if Bion's catalogue is sufficiently representative, the vernier itself was not much used until the end of the seventeenth century. Jacob's staff, the magnetic compass and the floating compasses of Peregrinus are all described. Land surveying was undoubtedly practised early in Egypt. Euclid and I iis brethren were called upon to settle disputes over land boundaries after the Nile had overflowed its banks. Systems of land tenure also developed the polirmetrui in 151.2, which was the earliest prototype of the theodolite and transit. In 1571, Digges producedi a description of his theodelitus with its relationship to the astrolabe. rThe book w;as called Pantowoetria and the author, as Aubrey, describes feelingly " cuLtting glasses in such a particular manner that lie could discerne pieces of money a mile off ", and again, "These signes are most dangerous for bludde letting, the Moone beyinge in tlem, Taurus, Gemini, Leo, Virgo, and Capricorne with the last halfe of Libra and Scorpius ". Rathborne's book deals with the Theodelite, the Playne Table, Circunferentor, Peractor and Decimal Clhayne. 1roportional compasses were due to Galileo andI early slide rules to Oughtred and Gunter. Thus, by the end of the seventeenth century all important items of a modern surveyor's equipmrent were in use, albeit in a crude forml. We are left, there- fore, to consult other works of reference, such as Stanley's Surveying instruh- tmentss, to show how in succeeding centuries extra refinements have been made possible due to magnificent design and craftsmanship. The theodolite for large surveys to-day is a very different instrumenlt from that of 1571. The remainder of the book is devoted to the development of practical geo- metry in schools, and the applications of geometry, and trigonometry to simple surveying. " If the Egyptian scribe. iAhmes, could return for a visit to this earth and witness a modern geometry class in action " what would be his reaction? Would he deplore the abandonment of the art of measurement in geometry and trigonometry ? To console the ghost of Ablmes, the author outlines a series of exercises in outdoor measurement. These are skilfully chosen and restricted to the capacities of the immature students. The mark- ings on astrolabes and the uses of quadrants as sundials are barely mentioned, evidently in the determination to make the classroom theory as simple as possible. A wealth of diagrams is supplied, including some from old books, thus making the problems realistic and the general lay-out artistic. Contro- versy now creeps into the sittnati(c). In practical mathematics, many teachers 310</page><page sequence="3">are averse to the presentation of a logical sequence in geometry, no matter how simple; so here many teachers will object to the practical work involved. The teacher will certainly have to practise dexterity in the use of his simple equipment, and the usual claim will be made that the whole business wastes too much time. Nevertheless, provided that this work is ancillary and does not interfere with the usual mathematical drill and technique, these ideas are worth a fair trial. It may be, that in the history of mathematics and in a little practical work, some teachers will discover the right outlet for that daily advancement which is certain to be favourably reflected in their pupils. This volume will supply a cultural need to all surveyors and mathematicians. It should be found in every school library. It is well printed on good paper and its cover, so different from that of the ordinary report, is very attractive. Looking back over the centuries with the author, an inescapable feeling emerges that measurement, in spite of the Irish poet, is a creation of the human spirit. In the hands of the mathematician, " it has taken man beyond the bounds of earth and helped him to form a fair picture of the infinite ". In the modem world, the eastern detachment of the poet is being challenged by a type of wisdom which is fighting desperately against terrific odds to orient command over matter towards spiritual ends. A. BUXTON. Guidance pamphlet in mathematics for high school students. Pp. 25. 25 cents; orders of 10 or more, 10 cents each. Report of the Commission on Post-war Plans of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (Mathe- matics Teacher, 525 West 120th St., New York, 27) What good is mathematics? The question is frequently asked, sometimes rhetorically with an implied answer, "None "; but when asked in earnest by the adolescent, it deserves serious attention. This pamphlet is an answer, couched in an informal style which should not frighten the high school pupil for whose guidance it is framed. Its sections deal with mathematics for per- sonal use, trained workers, college preparation, professional workers, women, civil servants, with lists of organisations, graduate schools offering doctor- ates, and references for further information. Much of the matter is special to the United States, but there is a good deal of general information which, in this handy collected form, should be useful to pupils and teachers in this country. Those who believe that our American cousins have no standard of value save the dollar should note the statement that " if you enjoy mathematics, take no thought of the vocational uses in the to-morrow-sufficient for this day is the good thereof ". T. A. A. B. La G6omdtrie et Le Problbme de L'Espace. III. L'tdification Axiomatique. By FERDINAND GONSETH. Pp. 108. Frs. 7.50. 1947. (eiditions du Griffon, Neuchatel) Real geometry, the geometry of the space in which we live, sometimes engages the attention of topologists and differential geometers, but then only when they wish to consider a particular example of the spaces in which they are interested. The algebraic geometer is interested in projective spaces defined over any field, and does not usually care to elaborate the properties of that space, defined over the field of real numbers, in which a particular prime, the " prime at infinity ", is particularised. Consequently, the student who does not study topology or differential geometry very seriously at the university leaves euclidean geometry, which he has surveyed at school with the help of his own intuition and an inadequate set of axioms, passes on to coordinate or algebraic geometry, and may never attain to that knowledge of real space which rewards anyone who studies the consequences which follow from a set of suitably chosen axioms. 311 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
