<plain_text><page sequence="1">Crisis and the Spirit of Community* MELVIN RADER I There is no simple explanation of the crisis of our age. We used to blame the fascists for our ills, and now we blame the communists; but Hitler and Stalin would never have had a chance if modern civilization had not been monstrously defective, and until the basic evils are removed, new spectres will arise, time and again, to haunt us. We civilized human beings have been pouring new wine into old bottles. We have fathomed many of the secrets of the universe; we have invented the mechanical means to wipe out poverty and to build a world community; but we have attained no corresponding cultiva- tion of feeling and no adequate spiritual assimilation of the new ideas and techniques. Our "progress" has been far more swift in the tech- niques of homicide than in the arts of peace. For the last three or four centuries, the main impetus of Western civilization has been toward the hypertrophy of self-asserting drives and the corresponding decline of self-transcending impulses. The pre- vailing culture is competitive; economically the individual competes with others for livelihood; socially he competes for prestige. Value- standards are frequently based on rivalry and tend toward conflict. Individuals are often pressed into groups, but the groups tend to be pitted against one another and to be divided by barriers of class, nationality, race, religion, language, and custom. The resulting con- flicts among individuals and groups are potentially so destructive that the survival of civilization is in question. Modern dictatorships have sought to prevent social disintegration by extreme coercion, leader-worship, and chauvinism. But the cure is worse than the disease. The alternative to both a communist or fascist *Presidential Address delivered before the twenty-seventh annual meeting of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association at Stanford Univer- sity, December 29, 30, and 31, 1953. 40</page><page sequence="2">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY dictatorship and an individualistic system of devil-take-the-hindmost is the cultivation of free, cooperative communities. Indeed, the develop- ment of cooperative ways of living to replace the present competitive ways is the prime need of mankind at this critical juncture of history. Such unity cannot be imposed from without: it must spring from within. It cannot be attained by the intimidation, imprisonment, or extermination of those who do not agree. As Plato pointed out in the eighth and ninth book of The Republic, some societies, like certain personalities, act and speak as if they are unified, but they are masking inner anarchy by a feverish outward assertion of unity, noisily pro- claimed and coercively enforced. Such specious unification suppresses really vital elements of internal life. Genuine unity, which reconciles freedom with organization, can be achieved only by that complex of psychological factors which gives inner cohesion to a community. Institutions and material resources are necessary, but they are vacuous without a spiritual substance to give them force. A civilization based upon the growth of material power will break down, as modern civi- lization has been breaking down, unless there is a coherent core of values that unites its members. These values must be more than a set of abstract moral precepts. Cerebrally a man may know his duty but unless his passion fights on the side of his intelligence, he may be wicked, foolish, or mechanical in his behavior. Not only understanding of the good, therefore, but devotion to it is required. Without this devotion, a person is very likely to think to himself, "Why should I bother about society?" His attitude will remain egocentric or his efforts will be half-hearted. But when he acquires a profound emotional conviction that his ideals are based upon the nature of things, he may be lifted right out of his listless humdrum self and gain immensely in strength, forcefulness, and passion. Such transformation and integration of a whole life can be called, in the wide sense, "religious." I use this word with some hesitation because of its supernaturalistic connotations. Like many philosophers, I count myself a naturalist. I regard the transition from myth to science-a transition still far from complete-as the grandest achievement of the human intellect. Most of what passes under the name of "religion" seems to me myth, archaic or decadent. However, I do not feel that naturalistic philosophers are justified in their usual neglect of religion. As Whitehead has said, "In consider- ing religion, we should not be obsessed by the idea of its necessary 41</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION goodness. This is a dangerous delusion. The point to notice is its transcendent importance; and the fact of this importance is abundantly made evident by the appeal to history."' Even superstitious beliefs and practices, since they have taken such a deep hold upon human nature, reflect some genuine need. Although religion has carried over into civilization many of the crudities of barbaric imagination, its very persistence and universality indicate something fundamental, something that may perhaps be given a noble and unsuperstitious expression. Moreover, in its more sophisticated expressions, religion is a far cry from primitive superstition. It is comforting to the anti- religious to suppose that the deeply religious man is homo ignorans or homo stupidus rather than homo sapiens, but this supposition is not justified. In thus asserting the value and importance of religion, I am not a revivalist-I have no desire to propagate any existing religion. Also, I have no wish to consider the arguments of natural theology. I should like to call your attention, however, to certain facts about religion that provide a clue to the interpretation of human needs. In this age of crisis we can no longer take any of the basic forms of culture for granted. Human beings must become transparent to themselves: they must understand the main forces and institutions that move them; and they must learn to control the deep irrational forces that when uncontrolled, drive men like autumn leaves in a storm. Only thus can they hope to find a vision deep and realistic enough to guide them safely in this age of monstrous tensions, and to make the arts of life prevail over the newfangled prodigious techniques of death. If, as some empiricists believe, religion is a passing phase of human culture to be superseded by an anti-metaphysical and scientific mentality, it might still be necessary to find a "moral equivalent." II I shall start with a very curious fact. The cultural conditions that have given rise to so much great art, science, philosophy, and states- manship have been singularly unproductive of original religious genius. We can recall scientists such as Archimedes, Newton, Pasteur, Darwin, and Einstein; or artists such as Praxiteles, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Bach, and Cezanne; or philosophers such as Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Hume, and Kant; or statesmen such as Pericles, Cromwell, Jefferson, 1Religion in the Making, Macmillan, New York, 1926, p. 18. 42</page><page sequence="4">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY Garibaldi, and Churchill. All these men flourished in relatively com- plex civilizations. Many of them lived in great cities or sophisticated centers of culture such as Athens and Florence. We do not look to such cities, however, for the original founders of the world's religions. Not a single major religion has ever been initiated by any of the myriad human beings in our teeming metropo- lises or even in our more cultivated towns and villages. The truly commanding- figures-men such as Lao-Tze, Confucius, Buddha, Zarathustra, Shankara, Jesus, and Mohammed, from whom have flowed the main religions of the world-belong to simpler societies of the dim and misty past. We can point to a few relatively minor cults and their founders, but how limited in comparison with the superlative religious geniuses and their world-conquering faiths! Of course, we have had our derivative figures, our preachers and theo- logians aplenty, but no great seminal religious minds. How shall we explain this paradox? We cannot say that religion, like wine, must be old in order to excel. Certainly the immediate followers of Buddha, Jesus, or Mohammed took no such view. Age may add a certain taste and bouquet to religion but it cannot account for its original tang. Neither can we say that religion is essentially primitive and there- fore must disappear as civilizations mature. It has been too deeply felt, too pervasive and fundamental a factor in human culture, to be dis- missed as belonging solely to humanity's nonage. It originates in less complex societies, but it proliferates and spreads over a vastly wider area. For example, Christianity sprang up in the villages of Judea, but it took the effete civilization of Rome by storm and has exerted a mighty role in the world ever after. Moreover, many highly cultivated human geniuses, such as Socrates, Bach, and Einstein, have been intensely religious. In this respect, religion is very different from magic, which usually remains local and primitive. There must be some point of contrast between the ancient, simple, and naive communities and the relatively modern, complex, and so- phisticated societies that will help to explain the fact that religion arises mainly in the former but spreads in the latter. The essential difference, I venture to think, is that the simple community is close, warm, intimate, and human whereas the complex society is relatively cold, abstract, and impersonal. In the simple community, men know one another very intimately as concrete, vivid, flesh-and-blood person- alities within the family, neighborhood, or small circle of friends. In 43</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION comparison, our modern societies function largely by way of abstract indirect relations such as communication by telephone, radio, printed page, or casual economic transaction. The difference between these two types of human associations can be made clearer by exaggeration. The following quotation from Karl R. Popper's book, The Open Society and Its Enemies, is apropos: "We could conceive of a society in which men practically never meet face to face-in which all business is conducted by individuals in isolation who communicate by typed letters or by telegrams, and who go about in closed motor cars. (Artificial insemination would allow even propa- gation without a personal element.) Such a fictitious society might be called a 'completely abstract or depersonalized society.' Now the interesting point is that our modern society resembles in many of its aspects such a completely abstract society. Although we do not always drive alone in closed motor cars (but meet face to face thousands of men walking past us in the street) the upshot is very nearly the same as if we did-we do not establish as a rule any personal relation with our fellow pedestrians. Similarly, membership in a trade union may not mean more than the possession of a membership card and the pay- ment of a contribution to an unknown secretary. There are many people living in a modern society who have no, or extremely few, intimate personal contacts, who live in anonymity and isolation, and consequently in unhappiness."2 This contrast between the concrete and abstract society is our clue for the interpretation of religion as a cultural force. In the intimate community, human beings first learned the ways of fellowship. Only within the matrix of loving personal relations, men like Jesus and Buddha and Lao-Tze came to spiritual birth. Here they developed the capacity for personal communion, which is, I believe, the main psychological source of religion. Here men of genius created the great religious symbols and myths of the human race, whereas in our ab- stract, sophisticated, kaleidoscopic societies, where even "charity" is institutionalized and thereby de-personalized, the geniuses are rela- tively untouched and uninspired by the close communion of persons. They can perhaps create great art, science, philosophy, and statecraft but cannot create great religious symbols. A city such as ancient Athens was intermediate between the con- crete community and the depersonalized society. Its citizens developed 2The Open Society and Its Enemies, Princeton University Press, 1950, p. 170. 44</page><page sequence="6">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY some of the mobility, intellectual detachment, and blase individualistic attitudes characteristic of modern urbanites, but without altogether losing the closeness and intimacy of the primitive blood-brotherhood. Their dramatists, such as Aeschylus and Sophocles, and their philoso- phers, such as Socrates and Plato, were still religiously loyal to the community-the sacred city-state. In reading philosophical works such as the Apology or plays such as Oedipus the King, we feel the conflict and tension between the old ideal of clan-fellowship and the new dawn- ing ideal of free "emancipated" individuality. The communal religious spirit was still creatively at work among the Greeks, but it was not so intense as among the less sophisticated people of Judea. In compari- son, the mobile, restless, uprooted denizens of our gigantic modern cities are much farther removed from the spiritual milieu in which the world's great religions have originated. Yet the hunger for communion persists even in the most contactless societies. Love is too instinctive ever to be wholly repressed. However depersonalized our human relations become, we try to reach across the abyss that separates man from man and man from the surrounding universe. Here, then, is the secret of religion's power. The basic impulse of the higher religions is to extend the community-mindedness of the close, intimate, concrete group to the wider sphere of the immense, im- personal abstract society. It is no accident, therefore, that religion uses the language of the face-to-face community: that it speaks of love, fellowship, brotherhood, communion, the fatherhood of God. It is no accident, also, that the higher religions seek to project these concepts to their widest possible scope. For this is the meaning of the higher religions: to take the love that is cultivated in the most intimate circles and to extend it to the widest circles that the human imagination can trace. Primitive religions similarly have expressed the values of the inti- mate tribal community, but they have failed to project these values beyond their original parochial limits. Lacking catholicity, they have remained local and often temporary. Likewise the more parochial religions of civilized peoples, such as Japanese Shintoism, have lacked the power to spread. In contrast, the greater contagiousness and via- bility of the higher religions are the result of two factors: first, they have expressed the primordial values of the intimate community and thus have tapped the deepest roots of human feeling; and second, they have sought to extend these values to the widest compass and thus to universalize them. 45</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION III If religion is rooted in community, this fact must be reflected in its fundamental nature, and indeed this is exactly what we find. A religion such as Hinayana Buddhism can exist without the worship of God; and a profoundly religious man, such as Spinoza, can forego any be- lief in the supernatural; but no religion and no religious individual, I am inclined to think, can exist without the realization, in some form, of the values of community. Admittedly, there are many definitions of religion and these vary widely. Leo Tolstoy, James Leuba, and others have listed definitions by the score. However, most authorities in the field-such as Emile Durkheim, R. R. Marrett, Rudolf Otto, and John Macmurray-seem to be agreed that the psychological essence of religion is the feeling of sacredness, or as some would prefer to say, of holiness. As Principal John Oman has declared, "If we are to have one mark of religion, it could only be this sacred ... valuation .... Everything that is sacred is in the sphere of religion, and everything in the sphere of religion is sacred."3 The attitude of sacredness is a complex sentiment-some- thing of a blend of wonder, awe, gratitude, and tender admiration. In his masterful work, Primitive Religion, Robert H. Lowie main- tains that the feeling of sacredness is evoked primarily by abnormal stimuli-the mysterious, weird, extraordinary, or supernatural. To a philosophic mind, however, even the most common objects can be sensed as wonderful and strange. What could be more mysterious, for example, than the universe of Hume, in which one incomprehensible event follows with incomprehensible regularity after another incom- prehensible event! However, one must be something of a mystic or a poet to feel, as Walt Whatman did, the sacred and unutterable mystery of the most common things, such as leaves of grass. While admitting Lowie's contention that the sense of astonishment is at the heart of religion, I believe that more is involved in religious experience than blank wonder and awe. There is also the feeling that what is deep and mysterious within oneself is akin to what is deep and mysterious in the object. "What is that," St. Augustine asks, "which gleams through me and smites my heart without wounding it? I am both a-shudder and a-glow. A-shudder, in so far as I am unlike it, a-glow in so far as I am like it."4 The unlikeness lends to religious 8The Natural and the Supernatural, Macmillan, London, 1931, p. 69. 4Confessions, Book XI, 9. 46</page><page sequence="8">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY experience its note of dread, but the likeness lends the note of tender exaltation. This sense of kinship seems to me not the whole of religion but an essential part of it. Toward sacred objects we generally feel a fundamental bond of community. The need for communion and self-transcendence springs largely from man's primordial solitariness. In the little span between birth and death, each of us experiences the poignant fact of being confined within his own skin and limited by his isolated individual selfhood. Each of us is curbed and hemmed in by the massive restrictive force of human culture, its laws, its taboos, its conventions. Each tends to feel small and insignificant and powerless before the vast indifference and immensity of nature. Especially in moments of crisis, every man, like a shipwrecked Robinson Crusoe, wants to escape from the little island of his own selfhood. Religion is the return from solitariness to community-it is man's endeavor, by an inward personal adjustment, to make himself at home in the world. By cultivating the religious sense of community, he escapes from his loneliness and self-alienation. The form of this self-transcendence is not necessarily attachment to a human community. In the religion of the Crow Indians, for ex- ample, the essential quest is to attain, in solitary vigils, communion with a supernatural Guardian Spirit. Likewise the higher religions have their recluses, each seeking a lonely understanding with his God. Even in the case of the mystic, however, the value of religious with- drawal is never to be found in mere isolation but in the spiritual union of the self with the non-self: "the flight of the alone to the alone." To this extent all religion is social. To say that religion is social is not to deny the value of solitude. Withdrawal, such as that of Mohammed into the desert or Jesus into the Garden, is characteristic of deeply religious personalities. The most intense religious experience requires inward concentration and mental detachment. Moreover, the need for privacy as a counterweight to the raucous mechanization and crowd pressure of modern life has never been greater than at present. If withdrawal is not a mere per- version, however, it is eventually followed by a return, with the re- cluse's contribution to society enriched by the clarification of intention and the concentration of power achieved in solitude. Individuality and sociality in religion are not exclusive and ought reciprocally to enrich one another. Religion has long affirmed the paradox that modern psychiatry has rediscovered--that one realizes oneself by transcending oneself. 47</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION To sum up, if sacredness is the subjective essence of religion, com- munity is its appropriate object and characteristic expression. This community may be conceived as human or superhuman, natural or supernatural; but even when it is conceived in non-human terms, devotion to it is very largely a sublimation of the love and friendship experienced in the close, personal, face-to-face community. Hence all the great world religions have originated in simple, primary-group societies like that of ancient Palestine, where men most naturally learn the ways of intimate fellowship. Religion is both individual and social, but the individual fulfills his deepest spiritual longings not by parting himself off from the surrounding world, but by the attainment of a harmony of the self with the Non-Self. IV When I use the term "community" I have in mind a basic relation- ship which all of us have experienced innumerable times. It is a simple fact that human beings are interdependent-they are held to- gether and unified by the attitude and practice of cooperation, collab- oration, reciprocity, and sharing. "Community," in this sense, refers to all the ways and means by which human beings freely recognize and realize their personal interdependence. It stands in contrast to the type of relation that exists when one person regards another as a mere tool; it involves a person-taken-as-person relation among free individ- uals, a relation of mutuality. Such mutuality is exhibited in any close friendship. Friends do not want to be isolated from one another, nor to master or dominate one another. If they are real friends, they recognize the right of each to be himself and therefore to be different. Indeed, this is the mark of friendship, that neither regards the other as a tool, to use, to exploit, to over-rule-that each respects and loves the other for what he is, a free independent human being. Friendship is a unity in which variety is cherished, and hence is the form of spiritual integration which most fully protects the freedom of its members. It thus exhibits the free mutuality, or unity of individualities, which I call "community." Religion, for the most part, is the consecration, generalization, and sublimation of the values of community. If we think of the small, intimate community as the microcosm, we can say that religion tends to interpret nature or supernature as the macrocosm. The microcosm is the community writ small, the macrocosm is the community writ large. 48</page><page sequence="10">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY Similar generalization may occur in philosophy. For example, in the idealistic metaphysics of Josiah Royce, the concept of community takes on a cosmic sweep. "The history of the universe," he declares, "the whole order of time, is the history and order and the expression of this Universal Community."5 Likewise Alfred North Whitehead has envisaged nature as a hierarchy of societies, the higher embracing innumerable lower ones. "The universe," he explains, "achieves its values by reason of its coordination into societies of societies, and into societies of societies of societies."6 Within these societies, moreover, "the entities take account of one another. What happens is an emer- gence, a fusion of entities, a mutuality .... A structural togetherness is being realized."' Even the entire universe is conceived as an "inter- locked community" of events. Nevertheless, the metaphysics of Royce or Whitehead is a philoso- phy rather than a religion, because it is primarily intellectual. Some- one has said that a sophisticated man's religion is his philosophy taken emotionally and practically. If so, the philosophy must be fundamen- tally transformed and take on the character of a sacred vision and way of life. Religion and philosophy may spring from the same metaphys- ical need--the need for some final adjustment of the Self to the great Other--but they differ fundamentally in the way in which this need is expressed. V There have been many religious variants of the idea of community. The totemism of primitive religion, for example, springs from the deep communal feeling of the tribe. At this level, man is scarcely aware of his individuality; he conceives of himself as an indivisible part of the cycle of all human and natural forces. Even inorganic objects are conceived of as animate and as having intimate affiliations with the human community. Primitive tribesmen really believe what St. Francis of Assisi taught, that the birds and beasts and fishes are their "little brothers." The tribe, as they conceive it, includes animals as well as human beings. There are many other types of primitive religion be- 5The Problem of Christianity, Macmillan, New York, 1913, II, p. 273. 6Science and the Modern World, Macmillan, New York, 1925, p. 145. 7From W. E. Hocking's summary of a conversation with Whitehead in Arthur Schilpp (editor), The Philosophy of Whitehead, Northwestern University Press, Evanston, 1941, p. 387. 49</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION sides totemism, but it is perhaps characteristic of all of them to express, in some generalized form, the values of the primitive community. In recognizing the communal nature of such religions, we do not need to agree with the French anthropologist, Emile Durkhein, who maintains that primitive religion is the worship of society, the sib, clan, or tribe, in the guise of totemic or other supernatural symbols. On the contrary, we should recognize that the concept of community is imaginatively projected far beyond the bounds of human society. As Gilbert Murray has said, religion is frequently "the groping of a lonely-souled gregarious animal to find its herd or its herd leader in the great spaces behind the stars."8 In the more civilized religions, there have been many variants of the idea of community, such as the Confucian doctrine of universal kindness, the Buddhist emancipation from selfhood, the Taoist sense of cooperation with nature, the Hindu vision of an all-embracing spirit, the Hebraic passion for social justice, the Christian fellowship of all men in God. Among the more universal religious creeds probably the most im- portant is mysticism. W. T. Stace, in Religion and the Modern World, has maintained that all religion, either implicitly or explicitly, is mys- tical. Although this contention may be an exaggeration, mysticism is at least a very characteristic and fundamental expression of the religious impulse. The basic doctrine of the mystic is that reality is an ineffable spiritual unity and that outer reality is identical with the essence of the human self. This creed is stated with breath-taking eloquence in the paradoxical words of Chuang Tze, the ancient Chinese Taoist: "The universe and I came into being together; and I, and everything therein, are One."' The mystic believes that it is possible to know this unity directly and intuitively and that this knowledge is supremely good. Some mystics contend that the One is an undifferentiated unity and that consequently all discriminations made by the human intellect are false. For example, William Wordsworth in an early manuscript fragment, described a stage in his mental development in which he regarded all forms, images, and ideas as "the very littleness of life" and as "relapses from the one interior life that lives in all things." It sThe Stoic Philosophy, George Allen and Unwin, London, 1921, p. 42. 9Robert O. Ballou, The Bible of the World, Viking Press, New York, 1939, p. 508. 50</page><page sequence="12">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY seemed to him that all our puny conceptual boundaries are man-made and that the true reality is a seamless unity: In which all beings live with god, themselves Are god, Existing in the mighty whole, As indistinguishable as the cloudless East At noon is from the cloudless west, when all The hemisphere is one cerulean blue."1 Such mysticism might be called "negative," because its object, however piercing, is empty and undifferentiated. There are a good many ex- amples of this type of mysticism in the history of religion. Its votaries teach the unreality of material things; they often regard the flesh and spirit as at war; they view the ordinary world as a prison or scene of exile; and they reject science as a basis of belief. There is another type of mysticism that can be called "positive," which is illustrated by a later stage in Wordsworth's mental develop- ment. In his famous Lines composed near Tintern Abbey, he speaks of an intense and joyous mood in which "we ... become a living soul" and "see into the life of things." In this passage describing a trance- like state, the one unitary "life" does not exclude "things" in the plural. There is no turning away from the copious variety of nature. Because of the mystic vision, nature seems more precious rather than less-, and real at its own level. Consequently, Wordsworth is A lover of the meadows and the woods, And mountains, and of all that we behold From this green earth.... Whereas negative mysticism apparently sacrifices community to a featureless unity, positive mysticism retains the love of individualities which is the distinguishing mark of community. It realizes that the unity of love is higher than the unity of inclusion. Love enjoys the difference between "you" and "me" and hence it is the natural bond of community. Consequently, a positive mystic such as William Blake, in his religious poem Jerusalem, spontaneously employs the language of the intimate community: I am not a God afar off, I am a brother and friend: Within your bosoms I reside and you reside in me. 10The Prelude, edited by Ernest De Selincourt, Oxford University Press, Lon- don, pp. 512-513. 51</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION The unity is very close, but it is a unity of distinct persons. The each is not submerged in the all. It may be that the difference between positive and negative mys- ticism is not so radical as it appears. All mystics emphasize the ineffable character of the mystical vision; and perhaps, as W. T. Stace has suggested, some mystics speak in negative terms because they feel that all positive characterizations are inadequate. Neither the positive or negative terms are to be taken literally because the truth of mysti- cism, they maintain, is incapable of conceptualization. I should be inclined toward such a non-literal interpretation not only of mysticism but of almost all religious creeds. The fantasies about the gods, about heaven and hell and grace, about Yahweh and Gilgamesh and Valhalla, are the poetic expression of the essential claim of religion--that community is sacred. If we look at nothing but the fantasies, the history of religion is disillusioning. Religion ordinarily asserts that her imaginings have objective existence, that the god, be it Isis or Apollo or Angra Mainyu, abides in the real world. Time and time again men learn that this claim does not corres- pond with fact; the human intellect eventually makes a clean sweep of all such fictitious objectivities. But religious fantasy is the bridge by which human beings, generation after generation, pass to a realiza- tion of the sacredness of community. Though the gods eventually dissolve like the figments of a dream, the evaluations which they symbolize seldom perish. VI Turning to these evaluations, we discover the fundamental simi- larity of the great living religions. Despite their particularistic creeds and rituals, they are a good deal alike in their moral injunctions, which exalt the widest human community. Precepts such as we associate with Christianity or Judaism occur in all the great scriptures. For example, among the aphorisms of Confucius we find: "Do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you." In the Tao Te King of Lao Tze we read, "Return love for great hatred." In an ancient Buddhist gospel we discover, "Cleanse your heart of malice and cherish no hatred, not even against your enemies, but embrace all living things with kindness." In a Hindu sacred book we are told, "As one's life is dear to himself, so also are those of all beings." In a Mohammedan text we read, "No one of you is a believer until he loves for his brother 52</page><page sequence="14">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY what he loves for himself.""' The unity of outlook indicated by these typical passages is an immensely impressive fact-a refutation of the superficial relativism which emphasizes exclusively the differences among the peoples of the earth. In thus generalizing the moral values of community, religion may appear to make an exaggerated or even non-sensical claim. For ex- ample, it may appear to be a meaningless paradox to say that even a stranger should be treated as a friend. Yet this paradox is at the very heart of the moral code of the higher religions. Of course, we cannot love strangers with the same personal intimacy that we feel towards friends. Love, nevertheless, can be projected beyond the intimate circle; it can become a very wide encompassing bond; it can become, in a sense, the basis of one's life and the supreme motivating force of one's being. Love of this sort is what Buddha had in mind when he said: "All the means that can be used as helps toward doing right avail not the sixteenth part of the emancipation of the heart through love."12 I do not deny that there is a darker side to religion. When human beings feel lonely and impotent and wretched, they may express their hatreds and frustrations in malign myths, such as the doctrine that the damned are everlastingly tortured by reason of man's sin and God's pleasure. A great many critics, from Xenophanes to Bertrand Russell and Morris Cohen, have exposed the fanaticism, cruelty, and superstition that have poisoned the well-springs of religious thought. The effect of religion upon morality, moreover, has often been like that of an anodyne. Advancing the doctrine that the universe is the handiwork of a perfect and omnipotent God, it has maintained that all evil is eternally resolved into harmony. Instead of realizing the ideal, it has idealized the real. And even when it has been deeply con- cerned with human suffering, it has often been the victim of a serious illusion. This has been the notion that we should "save" men by spiritual conversion alone. To affirm spiritual ends and to neglect material means, to seek to change men's hearts without changing their circumstances, to proclaim "peace and justice" but to disregard 11The quotations in this paragraph, in the order in which they occur, are from Lin Yutang, The Wisdom of Confucius, Modern Library, New York, 1938, p. 186; Robert O.

It will not do to plead that goodness is a state of mind and that its physical embodiment is secondary and incidental-this is a profound error of principle, a false religious idealism. It neglects the constant interplay of mind and nature, spirit and matter, thought and things. Its idealism is morally futile or mischievous because it distracts men's attention from the brute material forces which, in the absence of scientific understanding and political control, are left to determine human destiny. Substantial though these evils and illusions may be, they pervert and betray religion rather than express its innermost essence. If our interpretation is correct, this essence is the sense of sacredness based primarily upon the impulse of self-transcendence and communion. It is for us to separate the gold from the dross. VII I shall conclude with a few reflections upon the relation of faith to the great crisis of our age. History has now lent to the old, old question, "What shall we do to be saved?", a new terrible urgency. Why has this come to pass? The deeper and more ultimate explanation is that an atom, elusive though it be, is more easily understood and controlled than a mind. In the development of humanity different functions reach maturity at different stages: the understanding and control of matter, being less complex, has reached maturity before the under- standing and control of mind. Physical science, like a hare, has raced far ahead, whereas other human functions move tortoise-slow far in the rear. Mankind will not be out of danger until art, the impulse to appreciate, religion, the impulse to commune, politics, the impulse to govern, and humanistic science, the impulse to understand human nature, reach a maturity comparable to that of physical science and technology. When that time comes, men can safely unlock the ultimate energies of the universe. But now, in the interval of mortal danger, what can we do? First, we must buy time, we must stave off catastrophe. The evil passions that incite to war-fear, hatred, intolerance, and lust for power-are probably more rampant in the Soviet East than in the West, but they exist to a very dangerous degree in both areas. A truly liberal religion 54</page><page sequence="16">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY can help to alleviate these passions. It can teach human beings to return love for hatred. It can awaken in men's minds the hope of the great community. It can penetrate the iron curtains of the human spirit by kindness and patient understanding. It can demonstrate, as the Quakers have done, that decency knows no boundaries of class or race or nation. Thereby it can play an invaluable role in preventing an atomic Third World War. Second, we must strive to bring the lagging human functions to maturity; and religion is one of these functions. Its coming of age cannot just be whistled for and produced to meet an emergency. The deepest tides of the human spirit flow slowly, and they answer no command. We cannot foresee in advance, moreover, the exact form that a mature religion will take. It will probably arise, little by little, with the creation of a new social order, and differ fundamentally from the old orthodoxies. It may find more adequate expression in art and literature than in public worship or theological creed. Whatever form religion may take, it is unlikely to die out. Its value is not like that of a toy, the bauble of humanity's childhood, to be discarded as soon as our critical intellect matures. The religious impulse is as enduring as the human spirit itself-for it expresses the deep instinctive need to transcend selfhood and establish sympathetic relations to other things and especially to other spirits. All peoples and all ages feel this desire, and they cling to religion because it min- isters, however crudely, to this impulse. In our age of crisis, the need of self-transcedence is greater than ever before. The rise of an individualistic, technological, and indus- trialized civilization has undermined primary social relationships. The intimate unities of medieval life-the communal ties of family, gild, manor, neighborhood, and parish-have gradually been displaced by huge anonymous organizations and casual, fragmentary, dehumanized relationships. When life thus becomes impersonal and mechanically rationalized, men tend to lose the emotional basis of religion-the feeling of community. An industrialized mass-society, when undirected by humane social planning, notoriously tends toward a vulgar com- mercialistic materialism, or toward ugly forms of psychic regression, such as fascism. The main signs of crisis-ruthless competition, war, race hatred, political fanaticism, and tyranny--express the self-assertive and sadistic impulses which have now become marked. The very freedom that human beings have won at such prodigious cost is being threatened or destroyed by intolerance and aggression. 55</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION The supreme social problem of our age is to reconcile freedom and organization. Freedom without organization is a delusion: it spells anarchy and material bondage. Organization without freedom is a terrible straitjacket. But free organization-the spontaneous and un- coerced integration of the members of a society-is precisely what I mean by community. The spirit of community, I am convinced, must be given a new lease of life if we are happily to resolve the great crisis of our age. With patient, undaunted, stubborn persistence, we must create a world community to replace the anarchy of absolute nation- states, and we must renew the small, intimate, friendly community, without which the great community will lack roots and vitality. Step by step, we must build a new cooperative social order which will make the well-being of each citizen part of the well-being of all. Not only religion, but all the basic forms of human culture, must participate in this supreme task; but very little can be achieved unless there is strong conviction to lend to moral aspiration. Even if I were gifted with all the capacities of a great seer, I could not in the brief time at my disposal sketch for you the new faith and scheme of values which we so urgently require. I can merely indicate my strong conviction that we must bring back, into the very heart of our culture, the sense of community which our impersonal and over- disciplined machine civilization has so largely sacrificed. We must disengage this spiritual jewel from the exaggerated and intemperate claims of an uncritical supernaturalism. Only thus can the spirit of community be made to shine in its true light. I do not think it is necessary or desirable to cast wholly aside the old religious myths and symbols. We should not overlook the psycho- logical fact that the concrete image, as in the story of Job or the vivid personality of Christ or Buddha, is more unforgettable and inspiring than the mere abstract precept. But the image should be interpreted in a new manner, not with the superstitious literalism of the funda- mentalist, but with the ever-present realization of its ideal import and poetic substance. If we retain the old language, if we speak, for ex- ample, of "the brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God," we should construe the ancient symbols in terms consistent with modern knowledge. Likewise, if we continue to employ the concept of "God," we should interpret it in the light of modern insights. We should have in mind a different sort of being than the traditional anthropomorphic divinity; 56</page><page sequence="18">CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY ours must be the kind of God that is empirically discoverable: a finite, immanent, evolving, pluralistic God-the society of all the forces, human and natural, pushing on toward the good. Recent science and philosophy support the view that there is such a nisus, such an anti- entropic drive, toward richer quality and more inclusive unity. As we now envisage nature, it exhibits a series of levels of increasing com- plexity and wider integration: electrons, atoms, molecules, simple cells, plants, animals, personalities, and human communities form a mounting series. The higher levels tend to succeed the lower in time: there has been a progression from the amoeba to Neanderthal man, and from the very primitive level of human life to the greatest heroes, artists, thinkers, and saints. Each integrative level, moreover, exhibits its own emergent qualities and laws, and we must take account of the higher categories-the organic, qualitative, teleological, and social- in interpreting the more complex levels. There are biologists of repute, such as W. C. Allee, and anthropologists of distinction, such as Ashley Montagu, who maintain that the most important fact in organic evo- lution is cooperation-that without cooperation, without mutual aid, it is not possible to live and to advance. Likewise modern psychiatry has maintained that love is the key to life's riddles, and that when love is frustrated, the personality becomes disordered, morbid, and hostile. These facts and conclusions do not mean that the universe as a whole is an organism, or a purposive mind, or is governed by a person, or forms a spiritual community. An idealistic interpretation of all reality may ultimately turn out to be correct, but upon the basis of our present knowledge, it would be very rash to assert it. But even if the material environment is not itself purposive, it has proved itself fit to produce purposive beings and the higher levels of value. Even if nature is not alive, it enables the development of fullness of life. Even if the universe is not a community, the ideal of fellowship is deeply based upon the nature of things. I do not know how the universe will appear to a scientist several centuries from now. It may be that all our present insights -are but the pale shadow of the reality yet to be revealed. It may be that exis- tence is infinitely richer and finer than we have guessed, and that the future will be far more majestic than the past. It may be that all that is and has been is but the beginning of the beginning. We move through a little circle of light amid a deep night of mystery, and though modern science has widened the circle, it has deepened rather 57</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION than dispelled our wonder and awe. Hope depends upon such realiza- tion of the "poetry of life," its depths, its mystery, its wonderful promise. As human knowledge unfolds, the idea of community will find new unprecedented modes of expression; but it will have a profounder hold upon the human heart if men clearly realize that it is a fresh vari- ation of man's ancient and fundamental religious intuition. The essen- tial problem is to unite genuine feeling and tradition with modern forms of interpretation-to preserve the force of archaic religion while eliminating its obscurantism-to link new idioms and insights with the ancient poetic symbols of the race. Thus we can renew human faith without committing intellectual hari-kiri-we can achieve self- transcendence and the values of community while making a creative and humane use of the miraculous powers of science and technology.
