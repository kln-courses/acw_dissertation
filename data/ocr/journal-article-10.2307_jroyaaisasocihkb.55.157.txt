<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Images on Taiwanese Temple Altars of Koxinga and His  Generals  Keith G. Stevens We learned with great sadness of the death of Keith Stevens whilst this article was  in its final phases of editing. Keith was born near Birkenhead, UK in 1926 where, as  a schoolboy, he early determined to learn Chinese. Volunteering for war service as early  as he could, after a brief stint in the Fleet Air Arm and on convoy duty, he transferred  to the Indian Army, joining the 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force) in 1946.  He served with them until demobilisation in 1947. After time at SOAS and HKU  learning Chinese he joined the Army first in the Cheshires and then the Intelligence  Corps spending much time in Malaya and Singapore. His third career, with the  Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office’s Research Department, led to a five year posting in  Hong Kong. He joined the RASHK in 1963 and his first contribution to this Journal,  of a total of some 36 pieces, was published in 1971. This article is representative of  his many, detailed and illuminating contributions on Chinese religious iconography. A  full obituary will appear in Volume 56. Zheng Chenggong (Cheng Ch’engkung) 鄭成功 (1624-62) is Taiwan’s  most famous hero, a charismatic autocrat often described as a warlord, who  loyally supported the Ming rulers. He is often described as a ‘Pirate-patriot’.  A man of convictions and a consummate warrior, he resisted the Manchu  invaders. He failed to oust them and established the short-lived Kingdom of  Dong-Ning (東寧) in Taiwan.  Zheng has a number of names, the most common among foreigners  being Koxinga. This is a Romanisation of the honorific title awarded by the  Ming emperor, Guoshingye (國姓爺, Lord of the Imperial Surname). Because of  the Minnan pronunciation,1 it became Koxinga to foreigners and this is how  he will be referred to in this article.2 Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch Vol. 55, 2015 ©RASHKB and author ISSN 1991-7295 </page> <page sequence="2"> 158 Keith G. Stevens Shortly after his death Koxinga became a popular Minnan folk hero,  evolving into a legendary deity with a semi-official temple title of Kai Tai  Shengwang (開臺聖王, the Saintly Prince who opened up Taiwan). The deity  is widely known throughout Taiwanese Minnan communities. Although  Koxinga is a household name in Taiwan and familiar on the mainland of  China, particularly along the southern coastal region, it is relatively unknown  beyond Chinese shores. Authentic knowledge of the historical Koxinga is  limited. Much of what is heard nowadays, especially by devotees of his cult,  tends to be legend. This is particularly so with local versions of his life and  time in Taiwan as well as with national legends. All have been passed down  through generations of devotees with losses and accretions on the way.  Koxinga’s Legacy as a Hero and a Deity Koxinga is a cultural hero to the ancestors of the pioneering emigrants  from southern China, who faced Taiwan’s wild land and fearful aborigines. He  is the Chinese warlord, who in 1661 drove the Dutch East India Company  from the island they had ruled since 1624. He is the local Minnan leader of  resistance against China’s Manchu conquerors and the Chinese Nationalist  Party (Guomindang (國民黨)) regarded him as a patriot, who retreated to  Taiwan as a base to launch counterattacks against the Qing dynasty. He has  also developed into a People’s Republic of China national hero as the first  Chinese to expel Caucasian colonists from the shores of China.  Koxinga, famed in drama and folklore as well as history, evolved from  popular folk hero into a deity. He is revered in a number of temples in  Taiwan, though not always as one of the most powerful or principal deities.  He is, rather, deified as a protector of settlers, or an historical national hero,  who opposed the conquest of China by foreign invaders—Dutch or Manchu.  In the Guosheng Miao (國聖廟) in Taichung, Koxinga is the main deity with  the semi-official temple title Kai Tai Shengwang (開臺聖王) as noted above.  Koxinga is regarded as the patron deity of all Taiwanese. As such he is prayed  to for public and group benefits, such as protection from harm and assistance  during drought or floods, rather than for personal benefits. However, as a polite  gesture, casual visitors to the temple simply offer incense and oil to all the deities  on the temple altars, including Koxinga, without any specific supplication. Koxinga’s festivals are celebrated on several days. The two main ones  are his birthday on the thirteenth of the seventh lunar month, and the  </page> <page sequence="3"> Images of Koxinga 159 anniversary of his deification on the sixteenth of the first lunar month. In a  number of places, however, his birthday is celebrated on the twenty-seventh  of the eighth lunar month, for which we have found no explanation save,  possibly, that this is a Hakka (客家) variant. Soon after Koxinga’s death in mid-1662, a small memorial shrine was  built on the site where he died in Tainan (臺南市). However, in 1683, the  Qing having overthrown the Ming-Zheng regime, his tomb was relocated  to Fujian to avoid any anti-Qing uprising in his name. Today the tomb, in  Shuitouzhen, Nan’an County (水头镇, 南安市), is about 30km southwest  of the centre of Quanzhou (泉州市) and the same distance northeast of the  centre of Xiamen, Fujian Province (厦门市, 福建省). The worship of Koxinga in Taiwan continued unabated. The Tainan  shrine and all similar ones named him Kai Shan Wang Miao (開山王廟, the  Lord who Opened up the Mountains). Since Koxinga was still regarded as  an historical arch-enemy of the Qing, kai shan (開山), literally mountain- opening or trail-blazing, was a hidden reference to Koxinga as the first  legitimate ruler of Taiwan. It was not until 1874 that Imperial Commissioner  Shen Baozen (沈葆楨), recognising popular sentiment, petitioned the Qing  Court to rehabilitate Koxinga as a national hero who had driven the Dutch  out of Taiwan. This being the time when foreign powers were increasingly  encroaching on selected areas of China, the success of Koxinga was cited as an  example to inspire the populace. Shen’s request was granted and Koxinga was  even promoted from Yanping Wang (延平王)—the Peace-preserving Prince— to Yanping Junwang (延平郡王),3 He was also enshrined in an officially- sanctioned temple built in 1875 on the original site in Tainan. Legends about Koxinga Koxinga’s vision of Taiwan possibly did not extend to the island becoming  a province of China. He did, however, encourage migration from China to  Taiwan, if only to provide manpower for his army and navy. This led to a surge  of Chinese immigrants. The Chinese population had doubled by the time of  the surrender to the Qing dynasty in 1683. Eventually temples throughout  Taiwan were dedicated to Koxinga, reflecting the colourful tales told about  him, his patriotic fervour and the hope he generated amongst his followers. Many names and places in Taiwan (and in Fujian province) are popularly  connected with Koxinga and whether correct or not they are widely believed.  </page> <page sequence="4"> 160 Keith G. Stevens Some still-repeated stories contain details long shown to be manifestly untrue  or inaccurate. Temple custodians and devotees are only too pleased to relate tales about  the life and times of Koxinga, in spite of similar ones having been told in  other temples and elsewhere about other deified heroes. Among the legends  told today, he is said to have been born on the holy island of Ma Zu, off the  coast of Fujian province. Another describes how he pacified the aborigines,  near what is now Tainan, with a black triangular flag obtained from a temple  dedicated to the Northern Emperor (Beidi, 北帝)4 in Xiamen. The legend  claimed that the Northern Emperor himself had instructed Koxinga in a  dream where to obtain the black flag and how it was to be used. Another  Taiwan story claimed that Koxinga’s mother was Tian Hou (天后, Empress of  Heaven, the Goddess of the Seas).5 A popular tale related over centuries about other local heroes tells how  in difficult times when food was scarce the discovery of a rice bucket that  never emptied saved the day. The same legend is popularly attributed to  Koxinga, who dreamt that he had found such a rice bucket. When he awoke  he sought it out, also enabling him to feed the whole of his army at a critical  stage. An old temple keeper in Chiayi (嘉義市) in central Taiwan spoke of how  Koxinga made several attempts to climb Taiwan’s highest mountain, Yushan  (玉山, Jade Mountain) without success. During one of his attempts he met an  old woman who begged him not to go and offered him two spectacular pieces  of jade if only he gave up. There was one condition. He had to have one piece  carved with the title of Guan Yin (觀音, the Goddess of Mercy), to be placed  on the altar of the Guan Yin temple. The other piece he could have carved for  himself. Koxinga took the jade, gave up his attempts to scale the mountain,  and returned to Tainan. Ignoring the old woman’s request he had both made  into seals with his name and titles. No sooner had the characters been carved  than they faded and were replaced by the characters for Guan Yin. Accepting  that he had failed to honour his agreement he presented both pieces to the  Guan Yin temple. Despite being a widely celebrated, heroic cult figure, knowledge of  the historical Koxinga is relatively sparse and what we hear nowadays from  devotees of the Koxinga cult is mostly myth. Keene commented: ‘there has  been hardly a single fact in Coxinga’s [sic] life that has not been questioned,  denied or contradicted down the years’.6  </page> <page sequence="5"> Images of Koxinga 161 Crozier described how, over time, various groups have created their own  image of Koxinga; honoured by both Nationalist and Communist China, yet  also the symbol of the Taiwanese Independence movement.7  Koxinga has been used as an historical precedent not only by the KMT  in exile in Taiwan since 1949 but also by the Manchu dynasty, against whom  he had fought, who incorporated him into their Confucian pantheon towards  the end of their rule, as an anti-foreign (i.e. anti-Japanese) hero. Even the  Japanese, occupiers of Taiwan for more than half a century, involved their own  religion with his cult in Taiwan to encourage Taiwanese integration. Today  there is a memorial museum in his birthplace, Hirado.8 A tablet dedicated to Zheng Chenggong Xiangsheng (鄭成功先生) stands  on a secondary altar in the heroes’ memorial hall in a small town in central  Taiwan, dedicated to Luo Fuxing (羅福星), a Taiwanese patriot hanged by the  Japanese in 1913. Monumental Images and Images on Altars  Religious images on Chinese altars tend to be of celestial or  anthropomorphic spirits, both tending to be referred to by foreigners by the  blanket term ‘Chinese gods’, reflecting Christian missionary usage.  In Chinese tradition spirits are shen 神, (yang) or gui 鬼, (yin) ghosts  or demons, with shen being benevolent and lucky as opposed to gui that  are malevolent and unlucky. Spirits of humans have the capacity to be  transformed into one of the gods of the Chinese pantheon and these  anthropomorphic images, regarded as revered worthies or heroes, paragons  or patron saints, inspire people to follow their example and are intimately  involved in the affairs of the world.  The official Kai Tai (開臺) temple in Tainan is Koxinga’s cult centre  where he was canonised as Loyal and Pure, Zhongjie (忠節), and eulogised by  the then Governor of Taiwan, Liu Mingquan. The larger than life-size image  depicts him as a youngish man with an unsympathetic face, a moustache and  goatee beard. His left hand clutches his girdle whilst his right arm rests on  the arm of his chair. He is wearing dragon robes, and is supported by bearers  of his sword and seal.9 A number of other temples in Taiwan, especially across  the south, have tablets dedicated to Koxinga on a side altar. One such tablet  in a temple in Miaoli describes him simply as Zheng Chenggong Xiangsheng  (Zhiwei) (鄭成功先生 (之位)). </page> <page sequence="6"> 162 Keith G. Stevens According to Clune, in his Flight to Formosa, a festival is celebrated on 15  February, the anniversary of the Dutch surrender and embarkation, honouring  Koxinga.10 Clune also described an image in the Koxinga shrine temple in  Tainan as appearing to be a representation of Frederick Coyett, the gallant  Dutch defender of Fort Zeelandia, with a pale face and haggard expression,  in a rather tattered uniform holding what looks like an empty water beaker,  perhaps showing he was starved into submission.  Several recent Taiwanese oeuvres record images of Koxinga as the main  deity on main or secondary altars in at least 80 Taiwanese temples or shrines,  not only under his most common titles but also under less well-known ones.  Chou Dezai (仇德哉), in his Compendium of Temples and Deities in Taiwan, lists  a total of 74 temples with images and tablets dedicated to Koxinga across  the whole of Taiwan, mostly in the south.11 The nineteen in Yilan County (宜 蘭縣) in the north-east are unsurprising as the predominant Minnan dialect  spoken there is that of the Xiamen to Zhangzhou (漳州) areas in Fujian  from which Koxinga and most of his army came. During my researches into  obscure temples in Taiwan, sometime before the Taiwanese works had been  published, I was disappointed at being only able to discover and visit eleven  of the Taiwanese temples containing recorded images.12 Anthropomorphic images of Koxinga vary considerably and presumably,  as there would appear to be no extant contemporary depiction of him, each  image relies on the carver’s ability to reflect the concept and wishes of the  image’s sponsors. Altar images of Koxinga tend to be either a portrait carved  in the likeness of his image at the cult centre in Tainan city, now more a  museum than a temple, or a customary image of a commonplace seated  mandarin in semi-armour without individual identifying characteristics.  The great majority of images are depicted seated, some dressed in  armour, others in the robes of civil officials with chest insignia indicating  rank. Only one has been noted carrying a weapon. This is the image in the  Kai Shan temple in Jelutong (日落洞), Penang (see fig.1), where he holds an  unsheathed sword in his right hand, pointing forward at waist height.  He may be portrayed middle-aged or indeterminate, as a mandarin or as  a military officer, black bearded or clean-shaven with moustaches or goatees,  with a red face or a dark brown face, with a five-clump, long straggly or  flowing black beard whilst several even have two-clump black beards.13  A clay image of Koxinga, his right hand resting on his knee and his left  hand on his hip, sits in front of the spirit tablet in the Zheng family ancestral  </page> <page sequence="7"> Images of Koxinga 163 Fig 1. Image of Koxinga on main altar, Kai Shan temple, Jelutong, Penang. hall in a lane off Chung-i Road in Tainan. The hall was built by Koxinga’s  son in 1663 and is locally claimed to be where Koxinga was first revered and  his cult as a deity began. The handful of temples in which Koxinga’s image or stele is on a  secondary altar are of interest. On a side altar in the Tiantan Tiangong Miao  (天壇天公廟) in Tainan, dedicated to the Jade Emperor, the Lord of Heaven,  Koxinga is represented by a stele and not an image. The main deities are  the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Daoist Trinity (San Qing 三清道粗).14  Flanking them are renowned and loyal generals, with Koxinga to the right  and Yue Fei (岳飛) to the left.15 According to the Tainan City Guide, ‘Koxinga  had offered sacrifices in the grounds where eventually this temple was built,  hence his image has been added and placed on this relatively minor altar’.  An unusual group in the Kongzi temple in Zuoying (左營區) consists of  Confucius (Kongzi 孔子) on the main altar, Koxinga on the secondary altar  right and Yue Fei as Yue Wu Muwang (岳飛穆王) on the secondary altar left.  The connection between the two secondary deities in both cases is probably  because both commanded armies fighting foreign invaders from the North,  Yue Fei against the Jins (Jurchens) and Koxinga against the Manchus.16   </page> <page sequence="8"> 164 Keith G. Stevens Temples with Images of Koxinga’s Subordinate Generals  The following selection will provide just an impression of the revered  spirits of the Generals and how their devotees regard them. They were, and  still are, usually revered and incense is burnt by individual devotees seeking  protection from natural disasters and individual ailments, or during major  festivals as simply a routine reverence. It also offers a very general impression  of the variations within the cults ranging from folk memory of the Koxinga  period, to individual cults within a village centred on the whim of a former  village headman, or the inclination of individual villagers. In several temples in Taiwan, where an image of Koxinga is the main  deity on an altar, it is flanked by a pair of subordinate generals’ images. Many  individual visitors specifically invoke aid, requesting personal benefits from  all three. However, there is nothing unusual in visitors paying customary  respects by burning incense before the images of each and every deity within  the temple, a practice, common throughout Minnan, regardless whether or  not they are aware of the deities’ function or competence.  In a number of temples, especially where Koxinga is known as Wangye (王 爺), that is ‘a pre-eminent spirit’, his image stands on a main hall secondary  altar dedicated to his army of spirit soldiers.17 These are portrayed by two  or three rows of images of ‘dynastic’ soldiers under an officer simply known  as ‘the general’ (see fig.2). This reflects the belief that Koxinga’s army of  spirit soldiers is able to protect humanity from the constantly threatening  depredations of demonic forces. A temple dedicated to Koxinga in Taichung  (臺中市) has a secondary altar with a number of these tiny images of Qing  dynasty style soldiers together with and under command of a nameless  ‘general’, known here simply as the Troop Commander (bujiang 部將).  The more senior of Koxinga’s naval and military senior officers were  regarded as ‘Generals’. Two such senior Generals were Gan Hui (甘輝) and  Zhang Wanli (張萬禮), who commanded major fleets of Koxinga’s Northern  Expedition in 1659.18 This was intended to encourage Ming loyalists to  rise against the Manchu conquerors. Koxinga laid siege to the Manchus  occupying Nanjing (南京). Gan Hui commanded the vanguard, with the  right flank fleet commanded by Ma Xin (马信) and the left flank fleet under  command of Zhang Wanli. Zhang is often simply referred to as Wanli in  Taiwanese temples. Both Gan Hui and Wanli perished at Nanjing, the loss of  the battle dealing a fatal blow to Koxinga’s anti-Qing ambitions. </page> <page sequence="9"> Images of Koxinga 165 Fig 2. Koxinga’s Spirit Army in Koxinga temple, Taichung. Images of both generals (see fig. 3) flank Koxinga, the main image, in  five Taiwanese temples despite neither Gan nor Zhang having taken part in  the Taiwanese expedition and siege of Zeelandia. These range from Tainan in  the south, where the three images are referred to as the Three Generals (San  Jiangjun 三將軍) or the Three Lords (San Laoye 三老爺) to the major temple  in Beidou (北投鎮) in the north. Another Taiwanese temple has two similar  images on a secondary altar, identified by the temple custodian as ‘Koxinga’s  subordinate generals’ though simply known to devotees as (Koxinga’s) sworn  brothers (xianghuo dixiong 香火弟兄) though without any image of Koxinga.  The Temple of San Laoye in Tamsui (淡水區) has a long history though,  with the passage of time and the chaos of the war years, the original temple  records and the stone tablet containing the history of the temple have been  lost. The name of the deity is Wang Chenggong (King Chenggong),19 also  known by the honorific title of Zhu Wangye (Prince Zhu), a title bestowed  upon Koxinga and, as noted above, Zhu was the Ming royal surname. A rural temple near Tainan dedicated to the San Laoye (三老爺),20  contained typical images of Wangye, the title meaning little at face value.21  All soon became clear when the three Wangye images, standard mandarins  without any unique identifying characteristics, were referred to as Wei 魏,  </page> <page sequence="10"> 166 Keith G. Stevens Zhu 朱 and Cao 曹. The temple keeper identified the three as Koxinga (Zhu)  in the centre, flanked by two subordinate generals, despite neither a Cao nor  a Wei being mentioned in historical records of the Koxinga era. The temple  keeper, however, explained that village folklore claimed ‘both Cao and Wei  had been senior generals in the force used by Koxinga to eject the Dutch  from Tainan’. Koxinga’s image is also accompanied by that of his personal  secretary, Ma Wangye (馬王爺).22 Fig 3. Images of Koxinga between Generals Wanli and Gan Hui, Beidou. The main deity in the Guosheng Miao (國聖廟) in Taichung is readily  identified by devotees as Koxinga though called only Kai Tai Shengwang. The  temple is unusual in that the side altar to the right is occupied by seven images.  These represent an unidentified subordinate general of Koxinga’s, a bujiang (部 將), together with six token soldiers of the army under his command. Several temples have two other anonymous generals, claimed to have  Koxinga connections and known only by their ranks. Fuyi Jiangjun (輔義將軍,  Righteous Assistant) and Fuxin Jiangjun (輔信將軍, Trusted Assistant) were  referred to as his subordinates despite both more usually being identified as  the subordinate generals of an entirely different deity, Kaizhang Zunwang (開 漳尊王 The Saintly King who Opened up Zhangzhou).23  </page> <page sequence="11"> Images of Koxinga 167 Zhenmen Gong (鎮門宮) is the temple at Lu Er Men (鹿耳門, Deer’s Ear  Gap), now dedicated to Koxinga. It is built on the site where Koxinga built a  stronghold. Although the altars bear many images of Koxinga as well as other  unidentified deities, possibly the most intriguing features are two of the six  door guardians of the Zhenmen Gong: barefoot Hollanders.24 (see fig.4) Fig 4. Hollanders as door guards at the Koxinga temple at Lu Erh Men. </page> <page sequence="12"> 168 Keith G. Stevens A number of temples in Taiwan contain images on the main or subsidiary  altars dedicated to Koxinga’s subordinate ‘generals’ who, from the local  tales, would appear to have been merely village headmen who had fought for  or supported Koxinga in his campaigns and been apotheosised by popular  acclaim.25 However, in several villages such apotheoses had been revealed by  the descendants of their headmen enabling them to bask in reflected glory of  the Hero. Ma Xin 馬信26 (see fig.5) Although Generals Ma Xin (馬信), Huang An (黃安), Yang Zu (楊祖),  Chen Ze (陳澤), Jiang Sheng (江勝) and Qiu Hui (邱煇) are all recorded as  having supported Koxinga in the campaign expelling the Dutch, only images  of two have been recorded on altars in Taiwan.   Fig 5. Ma Xin in Yong Xing temple in Guang Ming village, Taichung. </page> <page sequence="13"> Images of Koxinga 169 Koxinga placed great trust in Ma Xin, courtesy name Ziyu (子玉).  During the Northern Expedition Koxinga established five Tidu (提督,  captains general). He assigned Ma Xin, as You Tidu (右提督, the right  captain general), to command the Right Flank Fleet during the Northern  Expedition. Surviving the lost battle, Ma Xin then played a major role  besieging the Dutch Fort Zeelandia. Koxinga awarded him the title and seal  General Zhenglu (征虜將軍, General of Conquest and Capture).  When Koxinga planned the conquest of Taiwan in 1661, most of his  generals were reluctant due to the distance and danger. Only Ma Xin and  Yang Chaodong (楊朝棟) supported the idea. Ma Xin was made Zheng  Tai Xianfeng (征臺先鋒, the Vanguard for Conquering Taiwan). Leading  his division in support of Koxinga, Ma Xin surprised the Dutch by  circumventing the main fortress, Zeelandia, and attacking the secondary fort  of Provintia thus surrounding and isolating Zeelandia. He was then ordered  to besiege the main fortress, Zeelandia. During the siege of Zeelandia he is  said to have been referred to colloquially by his men as Ma Bendu (馬本督 ‘Ma,  our chief or ‘Boss Ma’). Ma represented Koxinga’s army during the Dutch  capitulation, exchanging memoranda with Frederick Coyett (揆一) 1615-87,  the Dutch commander in Taiwan.  When Koxinga died in June 1662, Ma Xin and Huang An, weeping  tears of sorrow, covered his body with a red cloth. Within a week, Ma Xin  too fell ill and died. Taiwanese Chinese, having recognised that Koxinga had  trusted Ma Xin implicitly, raised the Ma Gong temple in today’s Kai Shan  Road in Tainan in his honour, placing his image on the main altar and it is  here that his annual festival is celebrated on the twenty-third of the ninth  lunar month. A member of staff on a later occasion revealed that the temple used  to be known as the Temple of Kai Zhang Shengwang (開漳聖王廟 , The  Saintly Prince who Opened up Zhang(zhou), a region in Fujian). This title,  immediately post-Ming and during the early Qing, was a misrepresentation  of Ma Xin to deceive those who regarded Koxinga and his generals as enemies  of the Manchu Qing dynasty. Yet another member of the temple staff in 1985  claimed that Ma Xin is also known by the title Fushun Jiangjun (輔順將軍,  Assistant General).  According to a custodian in another Tainan temple, Ma Xin was also  known as Zhangjun Zhujiang (掌軍主將, ‘a subordinate general’) within  Koxinga’s Army. The main image in the Yong Xing Temple (永興宮) in  </page> <page sequence="14"> 170 Keith G. Stevens Guangming village was claimed by the majority of devotees to be Ma Xin,  though referred to as Marshal Ma (馬元帥).   Huang Jiangjun 黃將軍 (alias Qingyun Bo 清雲伯) (see fig.6) Huang Jiangjun was born during the late Ming dynasty and first became  a soldier during the fighting along the Minnan coastal area at the time of the  campaign leading to the final overthrow of the Ming. He later sought service  under Koxinga and crossed to Taiwan with him, where he earned respect and  honours during the battles with the Dutch.  Fig 6. Huang Jiangjun in Qingyun Gong in Huwei. </page> <page sequence="15"> Images of Koxinga 171 Sometime after Koxinga’s death Huang led a large body of Chinese,  together with Lin Yi (林圯), and opened up the Doulin-Liumen area of  central Taiwan. Then, following the defeat of Koxinga’s descendants when  the Qing dynasty took over Taiwan, Huang established a small community in  what today is Huwei (虎尾鎮), a small town in the centre of Yunlin County  some 50 miles north of Tainan.27  There are conflicting stories about the apotheosis of Huang Jiangjun.  According to the large tome listing Taiwanese temples and the accounts of  the lives of deified Chinese heroes,28 he was one of Koxinga’s subordinate  generals and is revered in Huwei as a bujiang (部將). The local official  county story of Huang in Huwei, however, makes no mention of Koxinga  or of Huang’s military career. It simply claims that a serious epidemic of  the plague killed many of the population with Huang caring for patients  completely forgetting to sleep or eat until eventually in 1668, at the age of  55, he too succumbed.  Local Huwei residents bemoaned their loss. But within a short time  a spirit, a shen 神 in the form of an apparition, was seen and identified as  the deceased Huang. Devotees realised that his spirit was still protecting  and caring for the living, just as he had done during his latter years and,  remembering his services to the community he was deified as Qingyun Bo,  Earl Qingyun. He was much revered by the local community, and honoured  with a shrine by local residents. This eventually became a temple, Qingyun  Gong (清雲宮) with the main deity, however, being Koxinga with Qingyun  and Koxinga revered at a separate altars. Qingyun was revered as a local  protective deity known as Qingyun Da Jiangjun (清雲大將軍, The Great  General) whose festival was and still is celebrated annually on the twenty- ninth of the second lunar month. However, reinforcing the claim that the  main deity in the temple is Koxinga, is a mural on the sidewall of the main  hall portraying Dutch officials on one knee before Koxinga surrendering Fort  Zeelandia at Tainan. The image of Qingyun on his altar portrays him as a standard mandarin;  seated, with a black face and beard, and with round, bloodshot eyes.29 The  image of his consort, with a gilded face, sits beside his right foot and a  ceremonial smaller portable image of Qingyun, also with a black face, is  beside his left foot.   </page> <page sequence="16"> 172 Keith G. Stevens Chen Leng 陳稜30 (see fig.7) The Kaishan Gong (開山宮), in central Tainan, is dedicated to the  Goddess of Mercy, Guan Yin Pusa, together with Baosheng Dadi, a secondary  deity.31 It should not be confused with the Kaishan Wang Miao (開山王 廟), located in the Tainan out-suburbs, which specifically refers to Koxinga  temples.32  Fig 7. Chen Leng in Kaishan Gong in Taishan. </page> <page sequence="17"> Images of Koxinga 173 On a small individual altar before the major altars in the Kaishan Gong  is a lone image, that of Chen Leng (? – 619CE), a general of the Sui Dynasty  (581-618CE). He was known as the Suihu Benlang Jiang (隋虎賁郎將, Brave  Tiger General of the Sui). The Sui was a short lived Dynasty of 38 years,  having only three reigning emperors, all of whom were served faithfully by  Chen Leng, who was also known as Chen Fu Qiansui (陳府千歲) and Chen  Zhangwei (陳長威). He was killed by a rival during the very early days of the  succeeding Tang dynasty in 619CE. Oral history claims that Chen Leng sailed from Chaozhou in Fujian and  seized the Liuqiu Islands in ca. 610CE. However, the identity of Chen Leng’s  precise destination remains inconclusive, with some arguing that Liuqiu was  actually Taiwan or Penghu (the Pescadores). The original Kai Shan Gong  temple in Tainan claims to this day to have been erected by Koxinga’s son,  Zheng Jing,33 to honour Chen Leng, and is so named as Zheng Jing regarded  Chen Leng as the first ‘conqueror of Taiwan’. This claim is still controversial,  though one temple keeper certainly claimed Chen Leng to have been the  mentor and patron deity revered by Koxinga. The term Kai Shan (開山, to  clear land, pioneer and settle) was later adopted by the Taiwanese as a specific  reference to Koxinga’s conquest. Ni Fu Shenggong 倪府聖公 (see fig. 8) The main deity in the Zonggan Gong (總趕宮), a temple in Zhongzheng  Street, Tainan city, is the Saintly Lord Ni, revered as a naval captain in  Koxinga’s navy. His annual festival is celebrated on the twenty-first day of the  eighth lunar month. However, a member of the temple staff claimed that he  was the deified spirit of Ni Ji (倪忌), born in either Quanzhou or Zhangzhou,  both Minnan coastal cities, and had been a ship’s captain who had brought  Quanzhou immigrants safely across the Straits of Formosa to Taiwan. His cult, first noted in Taiwan during the seventeenth year of the reign of  the Qian Long emperor (1752 CE), is also revered in two other minor temples  in Tainan, offshoots from his main temple. Local revelations about Ni’s origins and powers vary considerably, with  adherents at the main temple claiming that Ni, known under the title of Fuyi  Jiangjun (輔義將軍, Assistant Righteous General), many years ago appeared  in a dream to a local Tainan devotee claiming that he, Ni, had been a naval  commander serving Koxinga and requesting that a shrine be built in his honour.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 174 Keith G. Stevens Yet another body of opinion believed Ni Ji to be the deified spirit of the  Chief Harbour Controller of Chen Yuanguang,34 a popular deity in southern  Taiwan under the title of Kai Zhang Shengwang (開漳聖王) who is occasionally  referred to as Li Fu Zongguan (李府總官).35 This last identification has been  repeated by Chou Dezai also identifying Ni Ji either as Li Boyao (李伯瑤) or  Li Bomiao (李伯).36 Although Ni Ji’s full name is not known, it is clear that he had strong  connections with the sea, was a sailor probably born in either Quanzhou or  Zhangzhou and is now revered by descendants of immigrants from Minnan.  The devotee’s dream would appear to be Ni Ji’s only connection with  Koxinga with a number of today’s devotees appearing to have no doubts as to  its veracity. In repeating these tales we do need to note that although temple custodians  and god carvers are usually a fund of knowledge, one has to be very careful  before accepting their words of wisdom! A god carver in Tainan claimed that  one of Koxinga’s subordinate generals, executed by the Fujianese (Minnan), was  Da Zhongye (大眾爺), but was unable to provide further details. Presumably he  was referring to the ghosts known by this honorific, who are generally believed  to be those killed ‘in battle, by thieves, fire or water’; that is, humans who died  before their due date and whose names have been lost in time.37 Fig 8. Ni Fu Shengong in Zonggan Gong in Taishan. </page> <page sequence="19"> Images of Koxinga 175 Local Minor Deities Professed to have been Connected with Koxinga  A number of tales related in and around Tainan regarding individual  minor deities identified them as having been either one of Koxinga’s generals,  or who had served in his Army, or were claimed to have been local village  headman who had served in one of Koxinga’s armies. The latter tend to have  been immortalised by local popular acclaim, normally by the headman’s  descendants or local villagers who sought to be associated with their hero.38 Xie Deming (謝德明)  A carved image stood unsold on the shelf in a god carver’s shop in Tainan  having neither been purchased nor collected for at least four years. Each year  I was assured that it was an uncollected image and that it was not for sale,  having been carved to order by a local village headman and that it represented  Xie Deming, a contemporary of Koxinga said to have been a senior officer  who served with or had even been one of his generals.  A temple image of Xie Deming, under his temple title of Xie Fu  Yuanshuai (謝府元帥, Marshal Xie), is the main deity on a secondary altar in  this rural temple dedicated to the main altar deity, Guanghui Shengwang (廣 惠聖王). It is located a short distance from Tainan city and, according to the  Tainan god carver, is regarded locally to be the Xie clan temple.  Guanghui Shengwang, frequently referred to as Huguo Zunwang (護 國尊王), the Lord who saved the Kingdom, was Xie An (謝安), born in  319CE and died at the age of 65 having served five Jin 晉 dynasty emperors.  He defended the Jin kingdom and eliminated treacherous court officials.  Devotees from Fujian province bearing the same surname still refer to  themselves as ‘descendants of Marshal Xie’. The custodian of the Guanghui Shengwang temple explained that the  introduction of the image of Xie Deming into the temple dedicated to  Guanghui Shengwang happened many, many years ago, when his image had  been donated as a local protective deity by members of the Xie clan. The  custodian explained that Xie Deming had been a contemporary of Koxinga  and, he has always assumed, a general in Koxinga’s army, a frank admission  though not an unusual assumption. During one of my visits these issues led me to another small village,  located a short distance from the Guanghui Shengwang temple village, where  </page> <page sequence="20"> 176 Keith G. Stevens according to local devotees, ‘everyone understood that Xie Deming had been  a local villager who had successfully led men from their village against roving  robber gangs and been referred to simply by the honorific title of General’. I was delighted when eventually I was permitted to purchase the image  from the god carver who in the end may have been relieved to have rid  himself of the persistent foreigner. Shi Lang (施琅)  Shi Lang was formerly a senior officer in Koxinga’s fleet; however, having  caused Koxinga dire problems and fearing Koxinga’s harsh discipline, he  defected to the Qing fleet in which he became an admiral, though not fully  trusted by the Qing until the mid-1660s.  Koxinga promptly had Shi Lang’s father and younger brother executed. Shi  Lang sought revenge and eventually, in 1668, seven years after Koxinga’s death,  he submitted a memorial to the Kangxi emperor recommending the conquest  of Taiwan, then in the hands of Koxinga’s grand-nephew, Zheng Keshuang.  One outcome of his defection was described on 2 May 2010, when  newspapers in Taiwan reported the long-standing custom prohibiting  marriages between the Zhengs and the Shis (鄭施不通婚).39 The origin of  this custom was the long-standing feud between Koxinga and Shi Lang, the  Ming-Zheng turncoat, whose father, younger brother, son and nephew had  been killed by Koxinga in reprisal for Shi Lang’s execution of Ceng-De (曾 德), a trusted lieutenant of Koxinga’s. There was also the enmity engendered  by Koxinga promoting one of Shi Lang’s subordinates, Zhang Wanli, to  command the fleet’s vanguard. A number of years later, during a period of internal strife in Taiwan over  the legitimate succession following the death of Zheng Jin, Koxinga’s son,  Shi Lang, was ordered by the Qing emperor to transport 20,000 Manchu  soldiers to Taiwan. In September 1683 Shi Lang fought a decisive battle off  the Pescadores and destroyed the Zheng-Ming Taiwanese fleet. When finally  his fleet arrived off Taiwan with his large Manchu force, Zheng Keshuang,  Koxinga’s grandson, offered to surrender to save bloodshed and Shi Lang  was revenged. Shi Lang had defeated Koxinga’s lineage and ended Koxinga’s  Dong-Ning Dynasty for the Qing.  Later in the same year Shi Lang convinced the Qing rulers that Taiwan  should be part of China and it was incorporated into the Chinese Empire,  </page> <page sequence="21"> Images of Koxinga 177 together with Penghu islands (the Pescadores), under the control of Fujian  province, with its own inspector-general based in his yamen in the town now  known as Tainan. Shi Lang, ennobled ‘Marquis’ by the Qing, died in 1696 and was  recorded in the Temple of Worthies in Peking in 1732. Despite having defected from Koxinga’s Navy and later overthrowing  the Dong-Ning Dynasty, thus ending Koxinga’s lineage, Shi Lang is revered  in several Taiwanese temples, all being Shi Clan ancestral temples. A recent  image was installed on the altar in the Shi clan temple in Lugang (鹿港). Its  predecessor, carved in the late 1960s, was stolen in 1990. Its replacement was  carved in 1995 based on a sketch of Admiral Shi Lang taken from the Shi  family clan book.  Huang An (黃安) In view of his biography I have been surprised that I did not come across  images of or references to Huang An in any Taiwanese temple during my  visits. The courage of Huang An, a mere unknown sentry during the 1659  Northern Expedition, came to the notice of Koxinga, who promptly  promoted him into a command in the Left Assault Force, Zuo Chong Zhen,  during the siege of Nanjing. With many generals killed, the subsequent  defeat led to the disintegration of Koxinga’s army, with but a few, including  Huang An and his Force, successfully withdrawing.  Two years later, in May 1661, Huang An led two formations of soldiers  to Taiwan where he was promoted to the Right Tiger Pacification and  Protection Force (You Hu Wei 右虎衞) in the conquered aboriginal area.  After the death of Koxinga in 1662 several senior officers, led by Huang  Zhao, supported the succession of Koxinga’s younger brother. However,  Huang An refused to back them and when Koxinga’s eldest son, Zheng Jing,  led the army on the eastern expedition against Huang Zhao, Huang An led  his troops and subordinates to welcome him. Huang Zhao was killed and  the revolt suppressed. Zheng Jing, the eventual successor, presented Huang  An with the seal of General of Conquest and Suppression and appointed him  Commander of Military Affairs in Taiwan. In 1665 Huang An sickened and  died. </page> <page sequence="22"> 178 Keith G.

Another common title is Zhu Wang (朱王爺, Prince Zhu). 3 Some sources claim this was to conform to the ranking system of Qing nobleman  not a promotion. 4 Also Digong, (帝公, Imperial Lord), Zhenwu Dadi, (真武大帝, Truly Martial  Grand Emperor), or Shuantian Shangdi, (玄天上帝, Dark or Mysterious Heavenly  Upper Emperor). 5 Her most popular name is probably Mazu (媽祖, Mother Ancestor). 6 Donald Keene, Battles of Coxinga, (Lund Humphries: London, 1951) p.44J. 7 Ralph C. Crozier, Koxinga and Chinese Nationalism; history, myth, and hero,  (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1977). Crozier notes that primary  sources present a poorer picture of Koxinga than do later historians. Their more  inventive accounts, plus unwritten popular legends, have prevailed in shaping  both popular and literary images of our hero. 8 http://www.hirado-net.com/teiseikou/en/facility.php 9 In Mainland China another life size image, dressed in armour, stands in the  entrance hall of his Memorial Hall in Xiamen opened in 1962. A gigantic image  of Koxinga stands on Ruguang Rock on Gulangyu, the island off Xiamen,  from which it is claimed that Koxinga reviewed his naval force. More recently a  massive equestrian statue of Koxinga has been erected on a hill above Quanzhou. 10 The treaty was signed between Koxinga and Governor Coyett on 1 February  1662: Rev. W.M. Campbell, Formosa under the Dutch, (p. 455).

Surprisingly, there were none listed for the Pescadores.  12 I possess an image of Koxinga purchased from an image carver in Tanshui who  had been required by a temple committee to have a replacement carved as the  current image had proved to have ‘lost its efficacy’. This is not uncommon with  the problem of how to dispose of such unlucky images! </page> <page sequence="24"> 180 Keith G. Stevens 13 Beards are secured using clumped whiskers forced into two or five holes bored  into the face of the image. 14 The Three Pure Ones are a sacred trinity, the supreme deities of the orthodox  Daoist pantheon, ruling the entire Cosmos from the highest Heaven. 15 Yue Fei was the twelfth Century CE national hero revered for his loyalty and  remembered for his great bravery and patriotism. He is a popular folk religion  protective deity. 16 I have been unable to find and visit temples dedicated to Koxinga on Mainland  China. There would certainly have been small temples dedicated to him in Fujian  province a century ago and perhaps, one or more are still extant. A modern  Memorial Hall in Xiamen was built in 1962 containing a large image of Koxinga  and a display of swords, stone inscriptions and bronze cannon, together with a  jade belt, the hall’s focal point and said to have come from his tomb and to have  belonged to Koxinga.  17 Wangye worship (王爺信仰) is a primarily Southern Taiwanese, Taoist folk  religion. Initially wangye were pestilence-spreading spirits or promising young  scholars who met violent or untimely deaths, worshipped to avert the same  perils; later they changed into pestilence and evil averting spirits and revered  figures like Koxinga are examples. 18 Other senior Generals, who accompanied and commanded Koxinga’s major  formations in Taiwan, though named in history, would appear not to have had  their images placed on Taiwanese altars. 19 Wang Zhenggong, literally King Koxinga. 20 The San Lao Ye are a group of three deities on the main altar of five temples in  southern Taiwan. In both Shui-kang in Tainan county and in Tainan city the  three are referred to as non-pestilence Wangye; whilst in three of the six temples  the main deity of the trio is Koxinga [Zheng Chenggong] with the other two,  his subordinate generals.   21 Wangye, Royal Highness—literally ‘Lord’—is used amongst the Minnan to  address ambiguous spirits, be they friendly or dangerous.  It is a common title  in Minnan, especially in Taiwan where even pestilence or epidemic spirits are  frequently honored with this accolade, though as we see here, not always—with  Koxinga bearing the honorific. In another temple a subordinate General was  referred to as Yü Hualong (余化龍), whilst the second general’s name could not  be recalled. In a third the two accompanying generals were simply known as  Koxinga’s brothers (di). Yu Hualong died in 1868 after many years’ service, first  under the Ming when he was a ship’s captain serving under Shi Lang, and later  </page> <page sequence="25"> Images of Koxinga 181 under the Qing. He is referred to locally as Qing Wangye, Prince of the Qing in  honour of his service to the dynasty. 22 A blue-skinned deity described as Ma Wangye (馬王爺) seen on an altar table  before the image of Koxinga, the main deity in the temple in Tainan, was  identified simply as Koxinga’s private secretary, together with two other images  identified as Generals Cao and Wei (曹魏將軍), both remaining unidentified as no  personal names were known. Cao has a red face and Wei a black one, both having  long black beards. They have been noted in three temples in Tainan, side by side  on a secondary altar in two of the temples, and flanking the image of Koxinga in  the third.  23 The personal name of Kaizhang Zunwang is said to be Chen Yonghua (陳永華)  or Chen Guanghua (陳光華). He is remembered historically as either having  been killed in battle defending the city of Zhangzhou against marauding bands  of robbers in about 711 CE or having died worn out by his exertions to settle  the area in peace and prosperity, but not before he had colonised the Fujianese  prefecture of Zhangzhou. Surprisingly he would appear not to have been a  major contemporary figure. First deified as the Zhangzhou City God and now,  not only regarded as the ‘first ancestor’ of Zhangzhou, but also of the Chen clan  throughout South-east Asia. 24 I am indebted to Ronni Pinsler (Penang) for the detail and photographs  obtained during his visit to Lu Er Men in May 2013 contained in his personal  communication.  25 In traditional China, and Minnan was no exception, the typical apotheosis of  heroes and worthies tended to have been generated by popular appeal leading to  the orthodox deification at the will of Heaven.  The supernatural tended to be  reflected in popular oral tradition usually in tales involving the hero or worthy. 26 A Taiwanese historian, Huang Dianquan (黄典權) has speculated that Ma Xin  may well have been a Muslim, presumably because many Chinese with the  surname Ma are Muslim. 27 A local legend, involving Koxinga, explained how Huwei came to be called the  Tiger’s Tail. Long ago, in a forest of to the north of Chiayi there lived a ferocious  tiger. It regularly endangered local residents and because people had never seen a  tiger before, they foolishly treated the tiger as a big cat. Later, after Koxinga had  driven out the Dutch, the villagers appealed to him for help. He came to Zhuluo  specifically to rid the area of the tiger. Unnerved by Koxinga, the tiger fled and,  believing that it had left Koxinga far behind, it stopped to rest. To its horror,  Koxinga suddenly appeared and chopped off the tiger’s tail with a broadsword,  </page> <page sequence="26"> 182 Keith G. Stevens and from then onward, the place has been named Huwei. The tailless tiger,  having lost its power and prestige, disappeared. 28 Chou Dezai (仇德哉), 臺彎廟神大全, p 687. 29 Iconographically, a major deity with a black face often identifies him as a hero  and the community protector, whereas lesser images of guardians, escorts or  supporting officials tend only to have a black face when they are a guard or  escort. 30 The Patron deity said to have been revered by Koxinga. 31 Baosheng Dadi (保生大帝) is a very popular Minnan cult deity and the patron  deity of herbalists in Taiwan. He is said to have written a major medical  encyclopaedia and was a specialist in acupuncture in addition to his other skills. 32 This distinction has been addressed in 連橫, The General History of Taiwan  台灣通史 , (1920).  33 After Koxinga’s death, his son and successor, Zheng Jing (鄭經), gradually  became the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Dong-Ning (東寧王), the first  Han Chinese government to rule Taiwan. It ruled between 1661 and 1683 and  was a pro-Ming Dynasty kingdom.  34 Chen Yuanguang was a Tang dynasty general, who was either killed in battle  defending Zhangzhou from marauding bands of robbers in about 711 CE or died  worn out by his exertions to settle the area in peace and prosperity, but not before  he had colonised the prefecture of Zhangzhou. 35 It is possible that the initial letter of the surname Ni has been corrupted by  speakers of another dialect to an L. 36 Chou Dezai (仇德哉), 臺彎廟神大全 , p.690. 37 It was suggested in a temple in northern Taiwan that the Da Zhongye are only  spirits of those who had been killed by some form of weapon. It is, therefore, the  custom to offer them the same offerings as one would offer a good spirit, whereas  demonic spirits are merely propitiated. 38 In my experience many of the stories contradict each other. 39 This was declared by the heads of two clan associations from Taichung (Cheng)  and Hokkien (Shi), respectively. This proclamation is, however, both non- binding and without authority, so the 300-year tradition will continue. The  restriction on marriages between the two families was originally limited to area  around Quanzhou (泉州) but later extended to all of Taiwan. </page> </plain_text>
