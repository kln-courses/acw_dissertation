<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHANGING MEANING OF "EVOLUTION" BY PETER J. BOWLER Introduction.-Historians generally study the development of ideas rather than of words, yet in some cases it is of value to have detailed knowledge of the changing applications of a particularly crucial word. The history of the term "evolution" is a very complex case, providing a good illustration of the care which must be taken in studying the origin of even the most commonly used words. Many different fields make use of this term, and at certain times a single field has used it not only to describe two different processes, but even two fundamentally different views of the nature of the same process.1 This is particularly true of biology, which is the chief concern of the following paper. It is well known that "evolution" was not generally used to describe the theory of the transmutation of species until some time after the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859. Historians of biology are also fa- miliar with the fact that at an earlier date the word was used to describe the embryological development of a single individual, rather than the overall development of life on the earth.2 Yet it is not generally realized that in both of these senses, the word meant different things to different people. It has been used to describe embryological development by workers who held fundamentally different views as to the nature of that process, and similar complications may be recognized in the later use of the term to describe transmutation. Indeed, it is unlikely that any modern biologist would completely accept the sense in which his pre- decessors of the later nineteenth century spoke of evolution. The starting point for a study of the development of our English word "evolution" must be its Latin origin. The Latin evolutio refers to the act of unrolling, as in the unrolling of the ancient type of book. As 'Examples of the earliest uses of the term in its various contexts, military, mathematical, scientific, and general, are given in the Oxford English Dictionary, art. "Evolution." It should be noted that many of the additional examples cited below are drawn from a purely personal familiarity with the literature, and it is highly probable that I have missed many instances in which the word is used, especially in the nineteenth century. I believe, however, that my discussion is based upon a wide enough survey to be accurate in its generalizations. 2An early attempt to describe the changing biological meaning of the term is T. H. Huxley's article "Evolution in Biology," originally published in the Encyclopaedia Britan- nica and reprinted in Huxley's Collected Essays, II, Darwiniana (London, 1894), 187-226. An excellent modern study of the relationship between embryology and transmutation is G. Canguilhem et al., "Du developpement a l'evolution au XIXe siecle," Thales, 2 (1960), 3-63. 95</page><page sequence="2">96 PETER J. BOWLER defined in Dr. Johnson's dictionary and in most modern dictionaries and encyclopaedias, the literal meaning of the English counterpart is also to unroll or unfold,3 both of these senses referring only to the act of the opening out of parts which already exist in a more compact form. The nature of the changes undergone by the word now become ap- parent-by the mid-nineteenth century few embryologists still believed that the development of the embryo was no more than the expansion of preexisting parts, and no modern evolutionist would accept the idea that the species which have appeared in the course of the earth's history were in any meaningful sense already present at the beginning of the evolutionary process. "Evolution" no longer means the unfolding of preexisting parts; the process is thought to involve the creation of new structures or entities. Yet this in itself leads to complications, since many nineteenth-century biological thinkers drew an analogy between embryology and the appearance of new species and supposed that any system undergoing an evolutionary change must be subject to a steady increase in its state of complexity-an evolution must in some sense be a "progressive" change. But both the Darwinian and the modern theory would deny this, or at least relegate this factor to a less important role in characterizing the process. This again leaves the historian with the problem of dealing with a word which may be used by different writers in quite different senses. Evolution and Embryology.-Some historians of biology have given the impression that eighteenth-century embryologists applied the term "evolution" exclusively to the theory of preexistent germs, a view popu- larized by Charles Bonnet.4 Certainly, this was the most straightfor- ward application of the term, since according to Bonnet and his colleagues the germ of the embryo preexisted in the form of a complete miniature organism (possibly in a collapsed and unrecognizable state) within the female ovum. Development occurred purely as a result of an expansion caused by the absorption of nutrients. Cole has noticed that the first person to apply the term "evolution" to this unfolding process was Albrecht von Haller, in his notes to Boerhaave's Praelectiones Academicae of 1744.5 Here it is claimed that the "theory of evolution" (evolutionem theoria) of Malpighi and Swammerdam had become generally popular among Haller's contemporaries.6 It is clear from the 3I have checked two editions of Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language ...; the 3rd (Dublin, 1768) and the 9th (London, 1806). 4Bentley Glass, "Heredity and variation in the eighteenth century concept of the species," in Bentley Glass, et al., eds., Forerunners of Darwin, 1745-1859 (Baltimore, 1968), 144-72, 164; also F. J. Cole, Early Theories of Sexual Generation, (Oxford, 1930), 86. 5Cole, Early Theories of Sexual Generation, 86. 6The relevant passages from Haller's notes are quoted and translated in Howard B. Adelmann, Marcello Malpighi and the Evolution of Embryology (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966), II, 893-900;893.</page><page sequence="3">CHANGING MEANING OF "EVOLUTION" 97 subsequent description that Haller was referring to the theory of preexisting miniatures, although it is by no means certain that Malpighi and Swammerdam actually proposed such a theory.7 When he first began to write in support of this theory, Charles Bonnet spoke only of the developpement of the germ, but he later began to speak also of its evolution.8 That the English equivalent of this latter term was used in a similar manner is revealed by a passage in the Philosophical Transac- tions for 1760. Here a book reviewer explains that "Our author asserts, that every fungus is contained in an entire and perfect state in the egg, or as it is called, the seed, and wants nothing but evolution, in order to imbibe the necessary juices."9 This was written before Bonnet's Considerations sur les Corps Organises popularized the French evo- lution, suggesting that this fairly obvious extension of the original Latin meaning was recognized independently by a number of writers during this period. A glance at the Oxford English Dictionary soon reveals, however, that in the English language at least, the embryological meaning was not confined to the theory of preexisting germs. The term was, in fact, used in a general sense to describe the development of the embryo, even by writers who were opposed to the preexistence theory. The following statement occurs as early as 1669, in a Philosophical Transactions review of Swammerdam's Historia Insectorum Generalis: "By the word change [in insects] is nothing else to be understood but a gradual and natural evolution and growth of the parts."10 It is by no means clear that "evolution" here refers to a mere unfolding of preexisting parts. Although there are a number of statements in Swammerdam's work which have encouraged the belief that he helped to found the theory of preexisting germs (one of them is mentioned in the 1669 review1), Swammerdam stresses throughout that the insect grows by 7Adelmann argues against Malpighi's acceptance of the preexistence theory: Marcello Malpighi, II, 885-86. On Swammerdam's position, see n. 11 below. 8Charles Bonnet, Considerations sur les Corps Organises, in Bonnet, Oeuvres de Philosophie et d'Histoire Naturelle (Neuchatel, 1779), vols. 5 and 6. According to the preface, the first eight chapters of this work were written some time before the later parts; in these early chapters, the word evolution does not occur, although Bonnet makes frequent use of it in the later parts of the book. 9"An account of a work entitled Jacobi Christiani Schaeffer icones et descriptio Fungorum quorundam singularium et memorabilium," Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 52, part 2 (1762), 455-506; 500. The author of the review re- gards this idea as quite commonplace. '?Phil. Trans., 5-6 (1670), 2078-79; 2078. "Ibid., 2079, where it is reported that Swammerdam held that there was no true generation in nature, a common point made later by the supporters of the pre-existence concept, according to which there is no generation since all organisms have existed in their entirety (as miniatures) since the creation of the world. Swammerdam's original Dutch is very ambiguous at this point, and the reviewer's interpretation is probably erro- neous.</page><page sequence="4">98 PETER J. BOWLER epigenesis, a process which Harvey had defined as the sequential formation of the parts of the embryo. I have suggested elsewhere that Swammerdam believed in the preexistence of a design within the egg, rather than an actual miniature.12 The reviewer for the Philosophical Transactions must have been aware of Swammerdam's constant em- phasis on epigenesis, and this suggests that he was already prepared to use the word "evolution" to describe a process in which the unfolding was purely metaphorical, taking place by means of a progressive and sequential development of the parts of the embryonic structure. An even more general use of the term occurs in John Turberville Needham's Account of Some New Microscopical Discoveries, where nature is described as "ever exerting its fecundity in a successive evo- lution of organised beings."13 This remark suggests no particular system of embryological development, but Needham was to become one of the principal opponents of the preexistence theory. He developed an alternative system in collaboration with the French naturalist Buffon, a system in which the embryo was built up out of a number of freely floating "principles" contained within the semen.14 Clearly, he did not see the overall production of the new organism as a mere expansion or unfolding of a preexisting structure. An equally general use of "evo- lution" was made by Erasmus Darwin in his Botanic Garden. Darwin spoke of "The gradual evolution of the young animal or plant from the seed."'5 Elsewhere, he not only rejected preexistence, but also proposed a completely epigenetic theory in which the embryo goes through a number of significant changes before approaching its final form.16 The Oxford English Dictionary gives other examples from this period in which "evolution" is used to describe embryological development in a sense which does not restrict it to a mere expansion of preexisting struc- tures. Indeed, in the English language at least, the word seems to have been used more frequently in the figurative than in the literal sense. It should be noted, however, that the word was not popular enough in the 12See my "Preformation and pre-existence in the seventeenth century: a brief analysis," J. Hist. Biology, 4(1971), 221-43; 238. '3John Needham, An Account of Some New Microscopical Discoveries (London, 1745), introd., 1. 14For a summary of this theory, see, e.g., "A summary of some late observations upon the generation, composition and decomposition of animal and vegetable substances," Phil. Trans., 45 (1748), 615-66. Needham's theory closely followed that of Buffon, in which the embryo was supposed to be formed out of "organic particles" floating in the semen. The complexity of the embryological debates of the eighteenth century can be seen from the fact that Buffon, at least, thought that a complete miniature organism was formed immediately after conception and subsequently grew only by expansion: Histoire Naturelle, generale et particuliere (Paris, 1749), II, 292. 15Erasmus Darwin, The Botanic Garden (London, 1791), II, 8. 16Idem, Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life (London, 1794), I, 491.</page><page sequence="5">CHANGING MEANING OF "EVOLUTION" 99 embryological context to warrant discussion by dictionaries and other more general works. In addition to the Latin origin, Dr. Johnson's dic- tionary gives only the military and mathematical meanings, and the same is true of a number of similar works.17 Although the literal meaning of "evolution" would seem to present a barrier to its use by naturalists who believed that the embryo gradually developed new structures by epigenesis, we can appreciate how the barrier could be broken down by comparing this usage with a wider tendency which seems to have developed within the English lan- guage at this time. Since the seventeenth century, non-scientific authors had begun to use "evolution" in a figurative sense,18 referring to almost any kind of connected sequence of events. Usually, such an historical sequence could only in the most metaphorical of senses be regarded as the unfolding of a preordained design. Compared to this trend, the wider embryological use seems quite reasonable, and suggests that in general the term was being developed in a sense which was not in harmony with its Latin origins. But just as the majority of historical se- quences can be regarded as developing in accordance with some pattern controlled by the interaction of the forces involved, the embryologist also had to recognize that the epigenetic development of the foetus was not a random process. Some force (mechanical or vital, according to taste) must control the development, ensuring that the correctly shaped organs are produced in the proper sequence. Recognition of this point brought about a fundamental change in embryological thought, and this in turn changed the meaning of the term "evolution." The growth of the embryo came to be seen as a process directed toward the production of an increasingly complex structure, with the emphasis being placed not on the preexistence of a design, but on the organizing activity of the process itself. Already in the eighteenth century, the German embryologist Caspar Friedrich Wolff (1733-94) had opposed the mechanical philosophy underlying both the preexistence theory and the alternative systems proposed by workers such as Needham and Buffon. Wolff sug- gested that a vital force (vis essentialis or wesentliche Kraft) directed the process of epigenetic development which he himself had described with some accuracy.19 The leading German embryologists of the early 17Editions of Johnson's dictionary cited above, n. 3; also the Encyclopaedia Britan- nica, or dictionary of the arts and sciences, 1st ed.

Note that Wolff also uses evolutio in connection with Bonnet's theory, ibid., 2195.</page><page sequence="6">100 PETER J. BOWLER nineteenth century took up Wolff's ideas, with the most important of them, Karl Ernst von Baer, stressing that the development of the embryo was essentially a process leading to the production of hetero- geneity or complexity of structure.20 In his Uber Entwickelungsge- schichte der Thiere of 1828, von Baer used the German Entwickelung as his standard term for the process of development, but in some places gave the Latin evolutio in parentheses. As the German ideas slowly penetrated into Britain, the word "evolution" continued to be associated with them, at least to a limited extent. When he translated parts of von Baer in 1852, T. H. Huxley rendered Entwickelung as "de- velopment" but retained the Latin term in parentheses.2' The noted physiologist William B. Carpenter used "evolution" directly in the dis- cussion of embryology in his Principles of Physiology, where he em- phasized the importance of von Baer's work.22 It is hardly surprising that "evolution" should continue to be used to at least some extent as a word describing the development of the embryo. But its connection with von Baer's work was in fact leading to an important change in its meaning. "Evolution" could now be seen as a word suitable for a process which, far from being a mere expansion of preexisting parts, was directly controlled by a tendency toward increasing complexity. Evolution and Transmutation.-Although the theory of the transmutation of species was not commonly called the "theory of evo- lution" until late in the nineteenth century, the first use of the term in this context dates back to the first half of that century. Charles Lyell spoke of the evolution of one form of life into another as early as 1832, and Darwin himself used the derivative "evolved" in the sketch of his theory which he prepared in 1842. It is difficult, however, to determine to what extent these new applications of the word were a conscious ex- tension of the embryological use already developed in biology. It can easily be shown that by the 1850's the term "evolution" was being ap- plied to the progressive development of life which most paleontologists saw in the fossil record, and this appears to have been a deliberate at- tempt to emphasize the parallel with the development of the embryo. 20E.g., Owsei Temkin, "German concepts of ontogeny and history around 1800," Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 24 (1950), 227-46. 21T.

It was through reading this edition of Carpenter's book that Herbert Spencer first became aware of von Baer's work.</page><page sequence="7">CHANGING MEANING OF "EVOLUTION" 101 Thus the term is used by W. B. Carpenter in his description of the analogy between von Baer's embryological system and the fossil record.23 In 1858 the American geologist James Dwight Dana also spoke of an "expansion or evolution" of the fishes in the sequence of geological formations.24 An English translation of part of a work by the German paleontologist H. G. Bronn even used the word "evolution" in its title, as a translation of the German Entwickelung.25 But although all three of these workers eventually became more favorable toward transmutation, in this pre-Darwinian period they were all explicitly op- posed to transmutation as an explanation of the progression they ob- served in the fossil record. That "evolution" was gaining some popu- larity in the context of the progressive development of life is quite clear, but these examples cannot be used as evidence that the word already meant "progressive transmutation." As we shall see below, there was a school of thought which connected progression and transmutation, but the majority of paleontologists believed that the progressive de- velopment revealed by the fossil record had been brought about by a series of miraculous creations. It has already been noted, however, that there are a number of instances in which "evolution" was applied to transmutation before 1860. But in some of these cases-in particular that of Darwin-it is not easy to connect the use of the term with the idea of progression and hence with the embryological analogy. The transmutation of species need not be a progressive process, and Darwin's theory was certainly not developed as an explanation of progression. To appreciate the possi- bility that "evolution" could be adopted from an earlier context quite different to that of embryology, it must be recognized that the use of 23Carpenter, Principles of Physiology, 580. Carpenter distinguished between a progression following von Baer's principle of development from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous and the normal idea of a progressive ascent through the vertebrate classes in the order fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The crucial nature of this distinction was often missed by the nineteenth-century evolutionists who favored the belief that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny; see Jane Oppenheimer, "An embryological enigma in the Origin of Species," and Arthur 0. Lovejoy, "Recent criticism of the Darwinian theory of reca- pitulation: its grounds and its initiator," both in Bentley Glass, et al., (eds.), Forerunners of Darwin. 24James Dwight Dana, "Agassiz's Contributions to the Natural History of the United States," American Journal of Science, 2nd series, 25 (1858), 202-16; 215.

Bronn, "On the laws of evolution of the organic world during the formation of the crust of the earth," Annals and Magazine of Natural History, 3rd series, 4 (1859), 81- 90, 175-84. This is a translation of the last chapter of Untersuchungen iiber die Ent- wickelungs-Gesetze der organischen Welt wihrend der Bildungszeit unserer Erdoberfldche (Stuttgart, 1858). Bronn explicitly proposed a law of progressive de- velopment, but held that species were distinct entities. Later, he supervised the German translation of the Origin ofSpecies.</page><page sequence="8">102 PETER J. BOWLER the word was already spreading in other fields. It has already been pointed out that during the eighteenth century, the term had occa- sionally been applied to a sequence of events in time, without reference to the concept of the unfolding of a preexisting structure or design. In the nineteenth century, this practice was extended, in particular to in- clude the "evolution" of political or social organizations. A good example of this occurs in the work of the historian Sir Francis Palgrave: "Our constitutional form of government has been produced by evo- lution. As the organs were needed, so did they arise."26 This is a very modern sounding use of the term; it carries none of the progressive im- plications inherent in the growing embryological use of the word and concentrates solely on change produced by adaptation to new condi- tions. The existence of this trend, apparently quite distinct from the embryological use, must be recognized in any attempt to understand how "evolution" came to be associated with the transmutation theory. Sir Charles Lyell first spoke of an "evolution" in something like the modern sense of the word when he discussed and rejected Lamarck's transmutation theory in the second volume of his Principles of Geology. According to Lyell, Lamarck believed that "the testacea of the ocean existed first, until some of them, by gradual evolution, were improved into those inhabiting the land."27 It should be noted that Lyell seems to regard improvement as an integral part of the evolutionary process, a fact which makes it not impossible that he chose the word because of its embryological association with the process of development toward maturity. Charles Darwin's first use of the term, however, does not in- clude this implication. In the conclusion of his brief 1842 sketch of the theory of natural selection, he wrote: There is a simple grandeur in the view of life with its powers of growth, assimilation and reproduction, being originally breathed into matter under one of a few forms, and that whilst this our planet has gone circling on according to fixed laws, and land and water, in a cycle of change, have gone on replacing one another, that from so simple an origin, through the process of gradual selection of infinitesimal changes, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been evolved.28 26Sir Francis Palgrave, Truths and Fictions of the Middle Ages.

Ernst Mayr has stated (Animal Species and Evolution [Cambridge, Mass., 1963], 4) that</page><page sequence="9">CHANGING MEANING OF "EVOLUTION" 103 An essentially similar sentence occurs at the conclusion of the essay of 1844 and the Origin of Species itself. But the terms "evolution" or "evolved" do not occur very often in Darwin's writings and although he seems to have been prepared to regard the overall development of life as an "evolution," he did not use the word in the sense of the evolution of one particular form from another (i.e., in the sense used by Lyell in 1832). Nor does Darwin seem to have associated any idea of progressive development with the term, at least when he first began to use it. In the conclusion of the Origin of Species he expressed the opinion that in the long run natural selection would give rise to progress, but there is no hint of this in the 1842 sketch (the "simple origin" referred to in the above quotation seems to mean that the first living forms were few in number rather than simple in structure). Darwin did not use the term "evolution" in his discussion of embryology, and it is thus highly probable that his first use of it in the modern context reflects the in- creasing general popularity of the word. Like Palgrave, he saw the term as suitable for describing a general historical process or sequence of events, rather than as a reflection of the progressively orientated embryological meaning. A similar use of "evolution" to describe transmutation was made by Baden Powell in his Essays on the Spirit of the Inductive Philosophy.29 In the third of these essays, Baden Powell came out in open support of transmutation, but he was very suspicious of the idea of progression30 and was more concerned to show that the idea of a process of adaptation would not interfere with natural theology. We thus have clear evidence that in the mid-nineteenth century the term "evolution" was being used occasionally (1) to refer to transmutation, but not necessarily in connection with progression, and (2) to describe the progression of life by authors who did not accept transmutation. It is thus somewhat surprising to find that the term did not come into general use in the debates over the pre-Darwinian transmutation theories. The most famous proposal of such a theory-Robert Chambers anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844)-explicitly regarded a progression paralleling that of Darwin does not use the word "Evolution" in the Origin, and this is strictly speaking cor- rect. Mayr suggests that Darwin's reluctance to use the term was due to a recognition of its connections with the preexistence theories of embryology, but in view of the above examination of the embryological use this seems unlikely. If there was an embryological connection for Darwin, it would have been related to progressive epigenesis, something he would have equally strongly avoided. It is for this reason that I suggest a connection with the non-embryological use of the term. 29Baden Powell, Essays on the Spirit of the Inductive Philosophy, the Unity of Worlds, and the Philosophy of Creation (London, 1855), ix, xiii, 319, 328, 426. 30Ibid., 321-29.</page><page sequence="10">104 PETER J. BOWLER embryonic growth as the basis of the transmutation of species.31 Yet Chambers' book does not use the word "evolution,"31a nor do the well- known attacks on his system by Adam Sedgwick, Hugh Miller, and T. H. Huxley.32 The theory was usually known as the "transmutation theory" or the "development hypothesis," the latter forming part of the title of the relevant chapter in Hugh Miller's Footprints of the Creator (1847). The term "development" was almost certainly chosen because of the parallel between this type of theory and embryology, and as we have seen, "evolution" became associated both with embryology and with the fossil evidence for progression. Yet I know of only two exam- ples in which "evolution" was connected with the development hypothesis, both of which occur after the initial debate over the Vestiges had died down. Herbert Spencer introduced the title "theory of evo- lution" in his essay "The development hypothesis" of 1852, but as we shall see below, this is by no means a straightforward example. Edward Forbes also spoke of the "hypothesis of the evolution of all organized beings" in 1854.33 Although these references indicate that the con- nection between "evolution" and progressive transmutation was recognized during this period, I do not believe that they represent a general tendency within the pre-Darwinian debates. This comparative lack of interest in the term "evolution" probably results from the fact that the word was not as closely associated with embryology as was "development." The publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 did little to en- 31[Robert Chambers], Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (London, 1844; re- printed Leicester, 1969), esp. 212-13.

Hodge's study of Chamber's work has brought to my attention the fact that in a preface added to the 1853 edition of the Vestiges, Chambers spoke of the "gradual evolution of higher from lower . .. ," when describing the embryological system which first gave him the idea of progressive transmutation.

The law of po- larity was his own alternative to progression.</page><page sequence="11">CHANGING MEANING OF "EVOLUTION" 105 courage the use of "evolution" in connection with transmutation. The new theory tended to divert interest away from the progressive element which was so prominent in the development hypothesis. Darwin proposed natural selection as an explanation of transmutation by adaptation, and although he now believed that this would produce progression in the long run, this was by no means an important part of his theory. Since there was little reference to "evolution" in the Origin itself, there was thus no reason for the word to enter prominently into the debates over the book. I have found no mention of the word in the important critical reviews by Owen, Wilberforce, Agassiz, and Fleeming Jenkin.34 The term is equally ignored in the more favourable accounts given by T. H. Huxley, Asa Gray, and Charles Lyell,35 and in the early papers of Alfred Russel Wallace.36 Even Carpenter (who had used the term previously in connection with both embryology and the fossil record) did not mention it in his reviews of the Origin, one of which was entitled "The theory of development in nature."37 "Evo- lution" was used once (in a footnote) in J. D. Hooker's first discussion of the theory,38 and it also occurs in Dana's Manual of Geology.39 These 34[Richard Owen], "On the Origin of Species," Edinburgh Review, 111 (1860), 487- 532; [Samuel Wilberforce], "On the Origin of Species," Quarterly Review, 108 (1860), 225-64; "Prof. Agassiz on the Origin of Species," Am.

BOWLER were exceptions, however, and it was nearly another decade before the title "theory of evolution" began to gain popularity. It would appear probable that this popularity was largely the result of the theory being incorporated into the general evolutionary philosophy of Herbert Spencer. Herbert Spencer and Evolution-According to his Autobiography, Herbert Spencer's early intellectual background had from the first predisposed him to accept the transmutation of species.40 He openly supported transmutation as early as 1852, after which this belief gradually became incorporated into his universal philosophy of de- velopment known as the "Synthetic Philosophy." It was also in the early 1850's that Spencer became aware of von Baer's principle of de- velopment from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, a principle that he took as the model for his whole system of universal progress. At the same time, he began to use the term "evolution" to describe the growth of the embryo and (on one occasion, at least) the wider de- velopment of organic life through transmutation. But it was not until the 1860's that he adopted "evolution" as the general name for the process of development which he tried to trace out in every field from cosmology to the development of the human mind, thereby laying the foundations of the modern usage of the term. Spencer first began to use the term "evolution" in 1852, applying it to both embryological development and the transmutation of species. In his essay "The development hypothesis," he supported transmu- tation by ridiculing "Those who cavalierly reject the Theory of Evo- lution as not being supported by the facts. .. ."41 He noted that the only alternative-miraculous creation of species-is supported by no facts at all, and pointed to embryological "evolution" as an illustration of the ability of organic structures to modify themselves.42 It is highly probable that Spencer derived both uses of the term from his reading of W. B. Carpenter's Principles of Physiology. He tells us that it was by reading the 1851 edition of this work that he first became aware of von Baer's principle of development from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.43 Carpenter had used "evolution" not only in his dis- cussion of von Baer's embryology, but also when he noted that the same principle can be traced out in the fossil record. Although Carpenter op- posed actual transmutation, his use of "evolution" probably brought 40Herbert Spencer, An A utobiography (New York, 1940), I, 201. 41"The development hypothesis," in Herbert Spencer, Essays Scientific, Political and Speculative (New York, 1896), I, 1-7; 1.

Indeed, it would at first sight appear that in this essay Spencer was al- ready beginning his generalization of von Baer's principle into a philosophy of universal progress under the name of "evolution." The very title of the essay seems to connect it with the development hypothesis of the 1840's, which was thoroughly grounded in the idea of the progressive development of life toward increasing complexity. But it would be unwise to accept without question the belief that Spencer was already generalizing von Baer's principle into a theory of the progressive transmutation of species in 1852. Despite its title, "The de- velopment hypothesis" supports transmutation, not progression, with embryology being introduced to illustrate the possibility, not the di- rection, of organic change. At a later date, Spencer clearly stated that his early support for transmutation was not associated with a belief in progression-he had opposed the Vestiges of Creation because he felt that organic modification could only be brought about by adaptation rather than progression.44 His first discussion of "the Theory of Evo- lution" thus may not have been motivated by his desire to generalize von Baer's principle of development. Although Spencer may have derived the name "evolution" from Carpenter's discussion of embryology and the fossil record, it seems probable that it took a little time for him to appreciate the significance of von Baer's ideas and to connect them with his belief in transmutation. If the progressive principle was little in evidence in "The de- velopment hypothesis," within a few years it had become a prominent part of Spencer's system, the foundation of his whole philosophy of de- velopment. In 1857, the essay "Progress: its law and cause" gave the first complete statement of this philosophy, indicating how it could be applied to almost every conceivable field of study. Spencer did not, however, continue the generalization of the name "evolution" which he had begun in 1852. In "Progress: its law and cause" and the other essays which he wrote in the course of the 1850's, "evolution" was used only in its embryological context,45 with "progress" being used to describe the more general applications of von Baer's principle. This provides further evidence that when Spencer first coined the name "Theory of Evolution" in 1852 he had not yet begun to appreciate the possibility of constructing a progressive philosophy which would apply to the theory of transmutation. Not until he issued his First Principles (1860-62) did Spencer again introduce the general use of the term "evo- lution." He had decided that "progress" carried too strong an associa- 44See the autobiographical "The filiation of ideas," Life and Letters, 533-76, 541. 45E.g., "Progress: its law and cause," Essays, I, 8-62; 16, and "Transcendental physiology," ibid., 63-107; 106.</page><page sequence="14">108 PETER J. BOWLER tion with the development of human societies, and proposed "evo- lution" as an alternative name for the process of development which would free it from anthropomorphic overtones.46 He did not explain the origin of the word, but it seems certain that it was chosen because of its original connection with the process of embryological development as described by Carpenter. Although von Baer's principle of development had played an im- portant role in the creation of Spencer's system during the 1850's, it is noticeable that in the following decade he began to deemphasize the connection between embryology and the general process of "evo- lution." In the Principles of Biology (issued 1863-64), he specifically entitled the chapter on embryology "Development" and gave a footnote explaining that "development" and "evolution" refer to different types of processes.47 Evolution, he argued, consisted of an increase in both the size and the complexity of a system, whereas development involved only the increase of complexity. It is difficult to see why Spencer should re- fuse to admit that the embryo undergoes an evolution according to this definition, but in a biological context he now reserved the title "Evo- lution" exclusively for transmutation. Whatever the origin of his ideas, transmutation had now become the chief biological aspect of the system of universal evolution. Embryology was no longer admitted within the definition of an evolutionary change, and it is probable that Spencer's position on this point marks the beginning of a decline in the (never very popular) use of the term in an embryological context. Although it is difficult to see on what logical grounds Spencer could deny that embryology represented an evolution of the individual, there were reasons of another kind which may have prompted him to neglect the connection between this field and his wider philosophy of progress. Only in the most general sense did the development of the individual organism parallel the evolutionary changes which Spencer was now dis- tinguishing in cosmology, biology, and the history of human societies. Every process, including that of embryological development, ultimately resulted in a progression toward increasing complexity. But the problem with embryology-a problem aggravated by the earlier at- tempts to use it as a model for the overall development of life-was that it represented a process whose every detail was completely predesigned in accordance with a single objective. Spencer's ideas on transmutation, and the parallel systems he envisaged in other fields, were a good deal more sophisticated than the earlier laws of progressive development such as that presented in the Vestiges of Creation. Spencer still believed that adaptation was the central means by which transmutation had 46Spencer, First Principles of a New Philosophy (New York, 1864), 148. 47Spencer, Principles of Biology (London, 1864), I, 133.</page><page sequence="15">CHANGING MEANING OF "EVOLUTION" 109 taken place, and criticized both Lamarck and the Chambers for postu- lating a specifically progressive trend in nature.48 He even accepted natural selection, although he believed that the inheritance of acquired characteristics was by far the more potent means of bringing about adaptation. As early as 1857, he had realized that within his overall view of the earth's physical development, continued adaptation must, in the long run, give rise to progress.49 Every time a group of species became adapted to a new set of conditions, the chances were that there would be an increase in the number of species and that some of the new species would be more complex than any of their predecessors. As in Darwin's theory, progress does not occur all the time, but is statistically inevitable. With such a viewpoint, there was every reason for Spencer to be critical of earlier writers who had taken a simpleminded approach to progression, and this may have led to an increasing suspicion of the value of the analogy with the predetermined progressive development of the embryo. In First Principles and the Principles of Biology, "evolution" was used frequently and prominently to designate both the theory of the transmutation of species and the general tendency of which Spencer thought transmutation to be but one example. At first, these works were largely ignored, except among a close circle of Spencer's scientific friends which included T. H. Huxley.50 By 1870, however, they had begun to gain a much wider popularity,51 and it is significant that at about the same time the term "evolution" began to figure more promi- nently in scientific discussions. Because of his emphasis on adaptation, Spencer's biological evolutionism could easily be associated with the growing popularity of the Darwinian theory, at least at a general level that would allow both to be connected under the same name. But de- spite the sophistication of Spencer's views on the relationship between adaptation and progression, his basic definition of "evolution" continued to be in terms of a progressive increase in the level of com- plexity. Although most Darwinians turned away from progression to concentrate on the study of adaptation, their gradual acceptance of Spencer's name for the theory suggests that they were by no means completely opposed to the progressive implications of the Synthetic Philosophy. "Evolution" became associated with the theory of transmutation through adaptation, but its connection with Spencer's basic philosophy was not altogether forgotten. 48Ibid., 402-10. 49"Progress: its law and cause," 51-52.

BOWLER The Modern Theory of Evolution.-Beginning in the late 1860's, "evolution" began to figure more prominently in the debate over the transmutation theory. Lyell used the term at least twice in the tenth edition of his Principles of Geology (1867-68), the edition in which he finally accepted Darwin's theory.52 A. R. Wallace used it several times in his review of this work,53 although it should be noted that the word occurs very infrequently in Wallace's collected papers on natural se- lection which appeared in 1870.54 T. H. Huxley spoke of "evolution" frequently in at least one paper published as early as 1868.55 The in- troduction to Darwin's Descent of Man (1871) noted that many im- portant scientists "are still opposed to evolution in any form."56 Like Wallace, however, Darwin still made little use of the term in the bulk of his writings, but this did not prevent even the non-scientific press from recognizing that his theory was being increasingly referred to as the "theory of evolution." The accounts of the Descent of Man in both the Times and the Edinburgh Review mention the word,57 and reference to Alvar Ellegard's analysis of the debate shows that "evolution" was used frequently in the early 1870's, especially at the meetings and in the press reports of the British Association.58 By 1870 the term had also begun to appear in the actual titles of works on the subject of transmutation- the first example of which I am aware is E. D. Cope's "On the hypothesis of evolution, physical and metaphysical."58a In 1874, a paper by Louis Agassiz was published posthumously under the title "Evo- lution and permanence of type."59 Here Agassiz clearly recognized that "evolution" had become synonymous with transmutation, although he argued that the only evolution actually to occur in nature was that of the embryo. By 1878, the term had become important enough for the 52Charles Lyell, Principles of Geology, or the modern changes of the earth and its in- habitants considered as illustrative of geology (London, 1867-68), II, 254, 493.

In 1882, "evolution" was used prominently in both the titles and the text of two books by G. J. Romanes: Scientific Evidences of Or- ganic Evolution, and Mental Evolution in A nimals. A continuation of this trend is also evident in the translation of foreign works into English. The German Entwickelung in particular may be translated as either "development" or "evolution," and the lat- ter version is increasingly used toward the end of the century. It is em- ployed in the sub-title of Ernst Haeckel's History of Creation, although the alternative translation is also used in the text.60 In Haeckel's The Evolution of Man, this mode of translation appears to predominate throughout.61 In 1875, August Weismann's Studien zur Descendenz- Theorie was translated literally as Studies in the Theory of Descent, but by 1904 his Vortrige iiber Descendenztheorie was modified into The Evolution Theory. 2 Clearly, alternative names such as "theory of des- cent" did not gain any lasting popularity and, along with the old "de- velopment hypothesis," were soon swamped by the increasing use of "evolution." It can hardly be a coincidence that "evolution" came into common use at the same time that Herbert Spencer's philosophy began to enjoy some degree of popularity. As noted above, Spencer's interest in the process of adaptation easily allowed Darwin's theory to be associated with "evolution" in biology. But the essence of Spencer's definition was the progress toward increasing complexity, and there is evidence that the growing popularity of the word was paralleled by an acceptance either of Spencer's ideas or of the closely related belief that the de- velopment of the embryo represents a model for the evolution of the species.

BOWLER of a predesigned evolutionary process following a law of development analogous to that of embryonic growth.63 In this sense, "evolution" be- came for a time the new name for the old development hypothesis. Spencer's own evolutionary system included no obvious element of de- sign, but there was a close enough parallel between the two versions for the same name to seem appropriate to both. Nor was Spencer's work without its own direct influence, as is revealed by R. H. Lock's Varia- tion, Heredity and Evolution, published as late as 1907. Here was a work devoted exclusively to a study of the phenomena thought relevant to the process of adaptation, yet Lock defined "evolution" in terms of a gradual progression toward the more complex and specifically referred to Spencer to justify this approach.64 If this account of the origin of the word's popularity is correct, we should expect "evolution" to be more commonly used to describe the general development of life, rather than the transmutation of one par- ticular form into another. I believe this is true of the majority of the cases cited above; few of the later nineteenth-century writers followed Lyell's first use of the term in 1832. In general, "evolution" meant the overall process of development, and the word was rarely used in descriptions of the details of natural selection, or in discussions of specific examples of transmutation. A. R. Wallace provides an ex- cellent example of this-his early papers on natural selection made lit- tle use of the word, and his Darwinism of 1890 used "evolution" only in its discussion of the development of life revealed by the fossil record.65 Only in the twentieth century has it become common to speak of the evolution of one particular species from an earlier form, a custom which seems to have arisen as the original connection of "evolution" with a system of general development was forgotten. The trend toward a more specialized use of "evolution" by twentieth-century writers on transmutation marks the last important change in the word's meaning. Darwin's theory has enjoyed varying for- tunes, but by the end of the last century it had become accepted by most scientists that transmutation by adaptation was the only ac- ceptable version of evolution. In later decades, a synthesis with the new genetics has brought natural selection back into fashion. In the course of these changes, both the Synthetic Philosophy and the old de- velopment hypothesis have been forgotten, but the name "evolution" has remained attached to the transmutation theory as its connections 63Ellegard, Darwin and the General Reader, 242-79; esp. 272-73. 64R.

Only occasional attempts have been made to associate the modern theory with a cosmic philosophy of development-Julian Huxley has drawn such connec- tions, but admitted that his fellow scientists would be very suspicious of this aspect of his work.66 Modern debates on the "direction" of evo- lution have also been conducted within a framework quite different from that accepted in the previous century.67 The majority of evolu- tionists have questioned the old view in which transmutation was thought to give rise to an overall progress, although a few workers have attempted to redefine the concept of "progress" so as to give it a meaning within the present system. G. G. Simpson has argued that al- though progress is not the essence of evolution, there is nevertheless a sense in which man can be regarded as its "highest" product.68 Julian Huxley and J. M. Thoday, despite certain disagreements, have at- tempted to produce definitions of progress in terms of increasing flexi- bility or adaptability, allowing a similar conclusion to be drawn con- cerning man.69 The old Spencerian view is thus not entirely dead, although these new discussions bear very little resemblance to the old debates about progression, and the modern evolutionist tends to be as cautious as Darwin himself in arguing that natural selection must give rise to progress. In terms of the original definition of the word, perhaps the most striking idea developed by a few twentieth-century evolutionists is the belief that evolution might be no more than the unfolding of potential structures already present in the genetic material of the first forms of life. Weismann argued that just as the chemist can only create com- pounds in accordance with the potentials for combination already present in the elements themselves, so evolution merely exploits the potential variation already inherent in the first germ plasm.70 An essentially similar point was made by William Bateson in 1914 and by A. H. Clark as late as 1930.71 The modern idea of mutation has rendered this belief unacceptable, but the very existence of this possi- 66Julian Huxley, Evolution in Action, based on the Patten Foundation lectures de- livered at Indiana University in 1951 (London, 1951), 11-12. 67For a survey of these arguments: T.

BOWLER bility reveals that the same divergence of meaning has occurred within both the embryological and the Darwinian contexts of evolution. The view expressed by Weismann, Bateson, and Clark represents an equiva- lent of the old theory of preexistent germs upon a cosmic scale-both imply that "evolution" should assume its original meaning of an unfolding or unrolling of structures already present in either a real or a metaphorical sense. The alternative view in which "evolution" gives rise to genuine novelty has, however, remained the more popular in- terpretation of the word's meaning, although the changes are no longer thought to be part of a system of cosmic development. Conclusion.-From the beginning, "evolution" has been used by biologists in two quite distinct senses. Some embryologists applied it literally to the unfolding of a preexisting miniature, while others used it more generally to cover the process of development without implying that only an unfolding was involved. As the preexistence theory declined in importance and was replaced by the embryology of men such as von Baer, the word remained associated with this study and hence became connected with the idea of a progressive development toward increasing complexity. Its use by Spencer appears to arise directly out of the embryological context, with the result that the idea of progression be- came connected indirectly with the theory of transmutation by adaptation and hence with Darwinism. Spencer's philosophy seems to have been closely connected with the introduction of the title "theory of evolution," and although the modern theory is restricted to the study of transmutation, it was only with some difficulty that its practitioners freed themselves from the progressionist implications of the Synthetic Philosophy. An alternative, neutral meaning of the term has been used by English authors since the seventeenth century to describe historical developments without introducing a progressive implication. It is possible that this meaning influenced the choice of the word by Darwin, although it clearly does not represent a main current of biological ap- plication. It is thus something of a coincidence that the modern theory of evolution has approached closer to this neutral meaning, abandoning both of the extremes which have played such an important role in shaping the history of biology.
