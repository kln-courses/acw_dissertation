<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art Museum, Coral Gables, 96 pages, 197 en- tries, many illustrated, scarcely overlap at all. Only five of the fifty-four painters in- cluded in the Colby catalogue are also in the Lowe catalogue. The rediscovered Impres- sionists are mainly from New England and are genuine discoveries. Nicely printed and well-documented, with biographies of the all- but-unknown artists, this should be a useful addition to the literature. The French and American catalogue, treating as it does fancier and more familiar material, has a harder row to hoe-a task that is not aided by the generally mediocre reproductions, even with the use of lots of color. Trying to balance material about which relatively little is known with the often published and much- researched is futile, for the seesaw was weighted too unevenly. The influence that was the show's subject remains a rather general blur. acquisitions MM To market, to market: The Princeton Univer- sity Art Museum recently found itself the recipient of a bequest from the estate of Fow- ler McCormick. Established specifically as an endowment, the income of which will be used for acquisitions, the $2.5 million fund should send a happy director Peter Bunnell into the market. Commenting on the McCormick be- quest, Bunnell said: "This magnificent en- dowment will enable the museum to pursue an acquisition program unique in its history. Never before has the museum been able to focus on its needs and directions with the confidence which such an endowment pro- vides. Through this gift the museum will truly enter a new phase of its already distin- guished existence." In short, Princeton-like so many of its sister university collections- will no longer have to depend so substantially on alumni gifts for its major acquisitions. At even the conservative figure of 6%, the mu- seum should have more than $150,000 an- nually with which to go shopping, an enviable sum in this era of tightened budgets. McCormick, a graduate of the class of 1921, was chairman of the board of International Harvester and, together with other members of his family, was a strong supporter of the arts at Princeton, as well as other areas of the university. In 1972 he established a fund in the department to encourage and aid research efforts in the history of photography, and other McCormick gifts have supported uni- versity library and museum collections and research in the department of art and archae- ology. A new collector: Emory University, in At- lanta, Georgia, established its history of art program only in the fall of 1965. Almost im- mediately, it became apparent to the Emory faculty that their work was hampered by the lack of original works of art for student study. As William Crelly, Professor and now curator of the collection, has written: "Because of our financial limitations and what we conceived to be the special needs of our students, we made the decision to concentrate our collect- ing within the field of the graphic arts: illu- minations, drawings, and prints ... it has been possible for us not only to obtain art objects of exceptionally high quality, but works which we feel are particularly appro- priate for study and research in our field." In the spring of 1967 Emory's collection be- gan with a 1962 Picasso lithograph, and it now comprises some 300 items. In 1970 the collection was greatly enriched by the acqui- sition of a large number of drawings pur- chased from the estate of Paul Grigaut, a former curator of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Ranging from medieval illuminations to a 1974 group of assembled photographs by Jared Bark, the most recent change in policy was to acquire examples from the Far East, the first such acquisition being a woodcut by the 19th-century Japanese artist Kunichika. In between have come many excellent sheets from Italy, France, Holland, and the U.S.A. Acquisitions have been made with a "modest annual purchase fund from the university" as well as from many generous friends of the department. Obviously the collection still has a lot of growing to do, with specific gaps (cited by Crelly) such as Direr, Rembrandt, and major modern master drawings; but the even- tual goal is to build a collection of outstanding works representing all aspects of the graphic arts. It is also hoped that the department will some day be able to undertake work in the area of paper conservation. * indicates illustration africa, america, oceania BENA LULUA (Congo), Standing Female Fig- ure*, wood, 17" h., 19th c.
