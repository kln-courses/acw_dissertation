<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unearthing Benny the Bulldozer The Culture of Clearance in Postwar Children's Books FRANCESCA RUSSELLO AMMON In 1947 author Edith Thacher Hurd and illustrator Clement Hurd pub- lished Benny the Bulldozer . This thirty-three-page children's book, filled with colorful images and simple text, tells the story of a moody bulldozer named Benny, whom road-builders persuade to help clear the way for a new highway in the country. Without Benny's heroic assistance, the project supervisor laments, they will never finish the road in time for their Fourth of July deadline. Benny soon hauls away trees, digs through rocks, and evens out the soil. Thanks to his help, the crew meets its milestone, and they reward the bulldozer by putting him at the head of the opening-day parade (fig. 1). Leading a procession of cranes, dump trucks, earthmovers, and mixing and paving machines, Benny rumbles through town to the exu- berant cheers of well-wishers. The townspeople wave to him, set off fire- crackers in his wake, and cheer with delight: "Hurrah! . . . Hurrah for the new highway!"1 Just as the bulldozer triumphed in the postwar world of fiction - in a growing body of children's literature by the Hurds and others - it also gained increased traction in the real world. Between 1950 and 1970 wreck- ing crews demolished nearly 6 million housing units in the United States, a loss of roughly one out of every twenty dwellings. The demolished units consisted disproportionately of rental properties with nonwhite occupants; Francesca Russello Ammon is a Ph.D. candidate in the American Studies program at Yale University.

Most prominently, the interstate highway network displaced 42 bil- lion cubic yards of earth over 1.5 million acres of land, and rampant growth of suburban housing, shopping, and industry captured further acreage. Whether working in urban, suburban, or rural areas, these exca- vating machines and their public and private enablers shared a common goal: by clearing away the old, they aimed to create large, blank slates upon which new developments could be built. The simultaneous ascension of both the bulldozer and "bulldozer books" was no accident, but reflected parallels between the landscapes of fact and feeling.3 The books reflect the social, political, and cultural preoccupa- tions of their era, helping a younger generation to make sense of the world around them as their environment underwent massive physical upheaval. At times, the books also move beyond reflection alone to prescription as well.4 The authors naturalize the process of real-world demolition and 2.

His work on nineteenth-century America explores narratives that depict the clearing power of the axe as progress.5 Bulldozer books update this story for a more modern age; in place of potentially scary though realistic images, they offer cheery ones (fig. 2). By putting a happy face on demolition for their readers, the books subtly endorse the "culture of clearance" - that is, the ideology, technology, policy, and practice of clearing the landscape of its natural and built environment. Despite the interest that scholars and critics have shown toward the new postwar built environments of suburbs, highways, and urban renewal, they have paid scant attention to the clearance work that began these con- tionships between literature and society: reflection, expression of emerging themes, and social control; see Albrecht, "The Relationship of Literature and Society," 425-27. 5.

Given the "creative destruction" of capitalism - as articulated by economist Joseph Schumpeter and reappropriated for the built world by historian Max Page - parsing the intertwined processes of destruction and construction is difficult.6 Yet, as suggested by the dual actions articulated in Tear Down to Build Up , the title of one of these chil- dren's books, they are distinct steps in an overlapping process.7 Authors of works about the postwar period have spent much more energy considering what came before or after, rather than the intermediate process by which bulldozers and wrecking balls cleared the landscape in order to remake it. Although the proliferation of the bulldozer in texts, beginning in the 1960s, might suggest that this terrain is well covered, the term has served primarily as metaphor rather than subject. Authors name the machine as the symbol that urbanités protest, suburban critics lament, environmental- ists try to halt, and preservationists condemn, but they do not investigate its activities or appeal.8 Martin Anderson's The Federal Bulldozer and Jane Jacobs denounce the "bulldozer approach" to planning work this way. Con- temporary historical scholarship functions similarly, with environmental historian Adam Rome's The Bulldozer in the Countryside focusing less on the work of the bulldozer than on its consequences in spurring postwar en- vironmentalism.9 Moreover, while the recent historiography of urban re- newal strongly considers the political economy of postwar slum clearance and the protest that rose up against it, it largely overlooks the physical and ideological aspects of the process and its enabling machines - the culture of clearance.10 Authors of popular and academic works centered on the his- tory of technology have made the greatest headway into this subject, but on the topic of demolition they focus primarily on spectacular implosions and the long history of building wrecking rather than the mass, machine-based demolition work that distinguished the postwar period.11 The history of earthmoving and land clearance is similarly understudied.

One genre that has long paid bulldozers their due, however, is children's literature. A spate of children's picture books began appearing on library shelves during the 1940s. The books deploy image and text, with an infor- mational tone, to explain how the world works; their subjects are the ma- chines and operators behind excavation and wrecking; and their audience is a group of young readers generally between ages 4 and 12. While some of the texts were relatively marginal contributions to the field, others received wide appreciation. Major trade houses like Houghton Mifflin and Scrib- ner's published them. Popular books series like Little Golden Books and Book-Elf included relevant titles; the New York Times and Publishers Weekly reviewed them. Some of their authors and illustrators - including Virginia Lee Burton, David Macaulay, and Clement Hurd - received the field's pres- tigious Caldecott Medal and Boston Globe-Horn Book Award. Finally, despite their age, many of the books remain in circulation today: four titles currently in print occupy library shelves in the low thousands, another handful of texts circulates with about 500 copies each, over a dozen endure at the level of about a hundred copies each, and a final half-dozen or so still exist in smaller quantities.13 Although children's literature may initially seem an unlikely venue for this discussion of demolition, its perceived marginalization held practical appeal. Children's books have historically avoided the scrutiny that society applies to most products of commercial culture. If a casual observer thought about children's books at all, he or she typically regarded the genre as relatively pure and unworthy of critical examination. As literary scholar Lois Kuznets further notes, the books' characters can express desires that "evade individual and societal censors."14 Women's domination of chil- dren's book writing, publishing, and library services only further margin- alized the genre, which was even a stepchild within the larger literary field. The derogatory term "kiddie lit" suggests this second-class status.15 More- over, nonfiction children's books garnered even less attention and fewer prizes than fictional stories.16 Thus authors could deploy the clarity of chil- 12.

Scholarship on children's literature suggests that, in general, young readers approach books with open minds, using them to explore new ideas rather than to substantiate existing ones, as adults often do.18 Moreover, critic Paul Hazard has observed that books socialize all readers, but among children they also help develop attitudes and values that affect behavior.19 Acclaimed children's book author Burton has articulated her own belief that the books are "amongst the most powerful influences in shaping [children's] lives and tastes."20 The works can offer youngsters their first exposures to cultural knowledge and attitudes on morality, imparted with sanction by the par- ents and respected adults who read the stories with them.21 Schools and libraries facilitated authors' easy access to this malleable group.22 This com- bination of unregulated creative space and a large, impressionable, and ac- cessible audience made children's literature an ideal platform for the gen- erally uncritical, pro-clearance texts that began appearing at that time. It should be no surprise that some businesses recognized the books' public- relations potential and supplied photographs and information to support their production. Their involvement explains the sense of outright propaganda characterizing some of the works, even while most were more restrained. In her books on building wrecking, Jean Poindexter Colby ben- efited from the assistance of the John J. Duane Wrecking Company, Con- trolled Demolition Company, Central Building Wrecking Company, Inter- national Harvester, Bay City Shovels, Unit Crane and Shovel Corporation, and the editors of Wrecking and Salvage Journal 23 Similarly, Contractors and Engineers magazine, Portland Cement Association, Ford Motor Com- pany, and Standard Oil Company supported How Superhighways Are Made , while a Caterpillar tractor company employee, according to the acknowl- edgments page, "researched much of the information, supplied photo- graphs and reviewed the final copy."24 Although David Cooke was the book's official author, Caterpillar might well have claimed that title. Today, the company makes its role more explicit, directly branding children's games, books, stickers, and toys. 17. Betty Bacon, "The Art of Nonfiction," 7. 18.

The endurance of many of the titles today only begins to suggest the extent of their postwar circulation. The works are value-laden and prescriptive. Those values reflect adult con- ceptions from the period and have the potential to shape those of impres- sionable children as well. But they did not act alone. The Mound Metalcraft company introduced Tonka trucks in the same year that the Hurds pub- lished Benny the Bulldozer.25 Meanwhile, adults read newspaper and maga- zine articles that celebrated the "cleaning" of cities through slum clearance and the march of progress as suburbs and highways repurposed farmland and hills. The ideology embedded in representations like these combined with the incentives of federal policy and advances in equipment technology and practice to create a postwar culture of clearance. Postwar Clearance in the Real World While the culture of clearance achieved large-scale physical fruition in the postwar period, its ascension began much earlier. From the mid-nine- teenth century onward, urban reformers targeted slum clearance as a means for eliminating blight and bettering the living conditions of the poor. They pioneered some of the earliest major efforts during the Progres- sive era. Later, with passage of the Housing Act of 1937 (also called the Wagner-Steagall Act), the federal government began offering municipali- ties loans to clear one unit of slum housing for each new unit erected. At the same time, private developers pursued suburban land clearance. The Housing Act of 1934 provided builders with loans for large-scale land acquisition, while the tax code continued to subsidize mortgages for home- buyers. The legacy of this two-tier system of housing subsidies extends well beyond its New Deal origins.26 The experience of World War II disrupted ongoing debates over housing, while also exacerbating urban racial ten- sions, mythologizing the bulldozer, and advancing clearance machinery and techniques that would prove critical on postwar domestic soil. After the war's end suburban construction boomed. The G.I. Bill of- fered returning veterans financial incentives to pursue the American dream of home ownership. Mass construction techniques in communities like Levittown made these homes plentiful and affordable. Meanwhile, the 1954 tax code introduced accelerated depreciation for greenfield commercial development, motivating suburban building of a different kind.27 The Interstate Highway Act of 1956 further facilitated postwar suburbanization 25.

New construction for highways, homes, and industry re- quired unprecedented amounts of land clearance through the leveling of forests, farms, and hills. As environmental historian Rome has noted re- garding this period, on average "every year, a territory roughly the size of Rhode Island was bulldozed for urban development."29 Not all postwar clearance work involved unbuilt, suburban land. Wrecking crews cleared densely populated urban acreage as well. As fami- lies and jobs departed for the suburbs, they left in their wake poor urban populations, residing in aging housing, with a limited supporting tax base. Legalized racism, embedded within housing codes, trapped many non- whites in cities that were becoming increasingly immersed in an "urban cri- sis."30 Title I of the Housing Act of 1949 sought to remedy this situation by attempting to remake cities with federal funding for large-scale slum clear- ance followed by new construction.31 Cities subsequently demolished older communities so that builders could erect high-rises, downtown shopping, convention centers, and more highways. Although the Housing Act of 1954 expanded upon the earlier act to fund renovation as well as demolition, physical destruction remained an integral part of the ongoing urban re- newal program. In addition, the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Ber- man v. Parker affirmed cities' right to employ eminent domain in taking private property for the benefit of the public good of new development.32 By 1965 alone urban renewal had exerted a substantial impact on the land- scape: nearly 800 municipalities - located in almost every state in the coun- try - had or planned urban renewal participation. With only half of these projects at the execution stage, renewers had already acquired nearly 57 square miles of land, upon which wrecking crews had demolished over 150,000 structures.33 28.

The fairy tale had dominated since the early twentieth century and remained a common genre. As influential librarian Anne Carroll Moore argued, imaginative, fairy-tale literature could protect childhood as an innocent world. Books like L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, published in 1900, exemplify this tradition. But not everyone shared Moore's perspective. In 1921 progressive educator Lucy Sprague Mitchell pioneered a new, reality-based approach to chil- dren's book education with her publication, Here and Now Story Book.54 Hers was not a fairy tale, but an information book that rehearsed the expe- riences of everyday life in the built world. The modern city featured promi- nently.35 Literary critic Margery Fisher has argued that information books offer more than just "a mere collection of facts," but "contain fact, concept, and attitude" as well.36 Or, as Mitchell herself stated, they aim to give read- ers "not so much new facts as a new method of attack."37 Through these means, they help children understand the real world around them. Al- though Mitchell's conception of childhood realism broke with the fairy- tale tradition, it still recognized "children's ability to imagine possibilities beyond the everyday."38 Animated machines fell within the bounds of this "realistic" children's book world. Postwar bulldozer books built upon this tradition, deploying four common themes to subtly advance the culture of clearance: promoting technological progress, involving readers in clearance work, masculinizing bulldozer operators, and heroicizing anthropomor- phized machines. CLEARANCE AS TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS WITHOUT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES The most obvious theme uniting the books is the celebration of growth and progress enabled by modern technology, with scarce acknowledgment of its negative consequences. This triumphal spirit coincided with the 34. Lucy Sprague Mitchell, Here and Now Story Book. 35. The book developed in the same spirit as the two schools Sprague also co- founded: the Play School, which educated young children through physical engagement with their environment, and Bank Street School, which taught educational instructors and children's book writers like Margaret Wise Brown. The Play School eventually be- came City and Country School, which continues to the present day. For more on Mitch- ell, see Joyce Antier, Lucy Sprague Mitchell.

The act responded most immediately to the USSR's launch of Sputnik.39 Just as in the 1959 "Kitchen Debate," during which Vice President Richard Nixon countered Russian advances in rockets with discussions of U.S. growth in home construction, so too were cold war U.S. children's book authors showcasing the construction industry. While progress often remains an unstated subtext, Cooke invokes the word itself, writing in How Superhighways Are Made : "Of all the stories that can be told about progress in modern America, none is more exciting than that of how superhighways are made!"40 Replacing the word "superhighway" with "high-rise" or some other physical construction reveals a motto character- istic of many of the works. Some authors promote the cause of demolition-based progress by equating it with the advance of civilization. Colby's Tear Down to Build Up: The Story of Building Wrecking historicizes machine-based wrecking within a paradigm of natural evolution. Just as dinosaurs once foraged the earth with their teeth, and as early man struggled to tear down buildings by hand, Colby suggests, today's dinosaur-sized cranes bring a new era's power to an age-old process. By rooting the machines in this longer history, narratives like Colby's situate the "work of constructive, creative demolition," as she calls it, as a fact of life from the beginning of time; it is not new, but just how things are. Although the illustrations can convey a gloomier tone, Col- by's overall message is positive: "Of course, these cranes are there for the purpose of destruction - the tearing down of buildings - but they are also, in many ways, a sign of progress, of the world moving forward toward bet- ter living everywhere"41 (fig. 3). Authors further demonstrate technologically based progress by depict- ing bulldozers taming nature. The excavating machines in these stories dam rivers, cut through mountains, flatten hills, and fill valleys, bringing order to the seemingly haphazard natural world. Burton's Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel demonstrates this tenet pictorially by juxtaposing the previous development of homes atop rolling terrain against the straight- and-narrow order of a modern roadway.42 Norman Bate's book series even better exemplifies this phenomenon. In Who Built the Dam? he gives water- ways defiant personalities. Bate describes a river that enjoys racing down the mountain, selfishly washing away everything in its path: "Til smash this 39.

Til tear it apart! I'll wash it away!"'43 Thus when the engineers productively harness the power of the river for energy genera- tion, they also tame the whims of a willful river. Books like this suggest that machines are not destroying nature, but rather optimizing its use. Acts of omission offer another means for promoting the books' single- minded view of progress. In many of the works, authors skip quickly past the losses incurred for new construction; by ignoring the victims of progress, they demonstrate the selective nature of information books. The Busy Bulldozer, for example, begins with a bulldozer putting the finishing touches on a city lot slated for the construction of a new post office. The text avoids the questions of what building and people previously occupied 43. Norman Bate, Who Built the Highway 7 and Who Built the Dam?, n.p. 316</page><page sequence="12">AMMON I Culture of Clearance in Children's Books the site and how the land in this prime corner location became available in the first place.44 In another story, Carla Greene's I Want to Be a Road- Builder , young Beth and Jim delight to learn of a new road being built to link their family farm with the town, yet their celebration fails to consider the destruction of other farms that the new road likely required. Moreover, while agriculture admittedly generated its own environmental costs, the book overlooks the fact that completing the roadway will add new auto- mobile-based pollution, while also decreasing the open space available.45 Even when some books recognize preexisting structures on a site, they often do so while glossing over the building-removal stage, oversimplifying existing structures' abilities to escape the bulldozer, or even mocking the idea that they might stay put. The removal of houses in Let's Go to Build a Highway , for example, receives just one sentence of attention. The authors avoid accountability, writing vaguely and passively: "Any buildings on the land are removed while the engineers plan the highway."46 Colby more directly addresses the reality of building demolition in Tear Down to Build Up, albeit by calling "amusing" the idea that some building owners fight to save their lone structures.47 By contrast, in How Superhighways Are Made , Cooke introduces the prospect of house-moving, noting that "[w]hen land is being bought by the government for the new highway's right-of-way, the owner may decide that he wants to keep his house or building instead of having it torn down." Yet he omits any similar image or fuller description of the more common demolition solution.48 In a similar way, Burton em- phasizes the mobility of the house at the center of her fictional story The Little House . Burton's house begins life out in the country, surrounded by fields. Development grows up around her until the house eventually finds herself beneath an elevated train track and surrounded by skyscrapers. Saddened by the loss of her former pastoral existence, the house finds sol- ace through an "escape syndrome" of relocating back out to the country.49 Joe Goddard has classified this work, with its preference for the country- side, as symptomatic of an emerging environmentalism.50 Yet even a pio- neering environmentalist like Burton, through the limits inherent in her 44.

Frank Tashlins The Bear That Wasn't teaches a similar moral about the benefits of accommodating demolition and development, rather than tak- ing a stand to manage it. While a bear sleeps in his forest cave one winter, a construction crew arrives, bulldozes the trees around him, and erects a fac- tory on top of his cave. The awakened bear tries briefly to alter their course, but ultimately just returns to his lair for the next seasonal sleep; just as before the factory's arrival, he can rest happily while dreaming the sweet dreams of hibernation.51 In a manner similar to Burton, Tashlins resolu- tion reinforces the viability of physically or mentally transporting oneself back to a less developed world without confronting harsh reality. Instead of reclaiming his forest, the bear closes his eyes and goes to sleep. This strat- egy of avoidance suffices in the short term, but is not a solution to the prob- lems posed by the spread of sprawl and losses of homes, rural land, and open space at the hands of a culture of clearance. CLEARANCE AS AN ACTIVITY IN WHICH READERS SHOULD GET INVOLVED Bulldozer books' second, albeit less dominant tactic for advancing clearance is not only to educate readers about why progress is palatable, but also to invite them to take part in it. This strategy helps transform the books from static texts in the imaginative world to calls to action in the real one. Leťs Go to Build a Highway , for example, concludes with a list of nine activities that complement what readers have just learned. The list advises them to learn how to mix cement and to "write a letter to a newspaper in your town explaining where you think a highway should be built and why."52 Through techniques like this, young readers learn about the road- building trade while also receiving a broader education in aspects of citi- zenship and civic participation in support of highway development. Career-oriented books take a longer-term perspective in their call to action. I Want to Be a Road-builder articulates that objective right in its title. The dust jacket for Herbert Zim and James Skelly's Tractors reads: "The authors discuss tractor skills and tractor jobs, suggesting how a young person can get both."53 Vermont Roadbuilder is dedicated "to all road- builders and the children who want to become roadbuilders."54 Finally, other authors promote the jobs of machine operators and road-builders by positively delineating the training, camaraderie, and compensation the workers enjoy.55 Colby emphasizes the work's profitability, interest, and 51.

Perhaps someday you can be the man who sits at the controls of one of these powerful machines."57 BULLDOZER OPERATORS AS INSPIRATIONAL, MASCULINE MEN A third theme in support of demolition and clearance is the books' in- spirational and manly portrayal of the machine operators. They celebrate all-American masculinity rooted in smiling, strong, selfless construction workers. This association is particularly relevant in light of red-baiting and the lavender scare that characterized the era. Since conservative anti-com- munists believed sexual and political unorthodoxy went hand in hand, they targeted government employees who lacked sufficiently masculine attrib- utes. Thus the books helped educate readers in the characteristics of the in- creasingly important public portrayal of manliness.58 Few of the men in the books exhibit the brawn characteristic of older depictions of manual laborers. The drawings of the crew in Vera Edelstadťs A Steam Shovel for Me/, from 1933, typify this earlier aesthetic.59 Her mus- cular workers share the iconography of proletarian art; their chiseled fea- tures, giant skulls, and massive volume suggest seriousness and strength.60 To a lesser degree, this aesthetic also characterizes photographs of construc- tion workers from the era, such as Lewis Hine's images of Empire State Building construction, originally published in the children's book Men at Work.61 In general, however, the muscular male image characteristic of con- struction workers and bodybuilders of the interwar years fell out of favor in the postwar era, as the audience for such images became associated with homosexuals.62 The imagery of children's books seems to have followed suit. By contrast, the masculinity represented in postwar children's books is friendlier and derives more from workers' skill and association with machines rather than from their physique (fig. 4). Illustrations frequently depict operators smiling and waving to the children who watch them at work. Some even invite their young admirers to join them for lunch, a con- 56.

In Vermont Roadbuilder , the authors write about one construction worker: "Fred likes his work. Fred likes children, and the chil- dren like him." By association, Fred and his machine seem so innocuous that the children happily spend time playing in the bulldozer's open jaws63 (fig. 5). Some books take the man and machine association one step further, sug- gesting that operator and bulldozer essentially become one - creating "bull- dozer men," as one book puts it.64 In The Busy Bulldozer , the relatively scrawny and clean-cut Joe and his powerful bulldozer exhibit this joined-at- the-hip quality as they amaze an observing little boy.

Bulldozer gets ready to dig up a hill, the boy says: "Maybe the hill will be too steep for you" Joe responds defiantly, laughing "Ha! Ha! Ha!" while the bull- dozer emits a "GR-R-R-R-R-R!" sound and pushes away a pile of dirt. This pattern repeats throughout the story, with man and machine vocally mim- icking each other as they grunt and "grrr" their way through the task.65 Alternatively, when authors feminize the machines, the male operators demonstrate their masculinity through female guardianship. Burton's Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel works this way. When steam shovel Mary Anne outlives her usefulness, Mike feels unable to send her to the junk pile; instead, they begin one last task of excavating the cellar for a new town hall. Once finished, they realize they have dug themselves permanently into the hole, so Mike converts Mary Anne into a furnace for the building and then becomes her caretaker. They live out their days together in the cellar, just like an aging husband and wife.66 While female machines are characteristic 65. Browning, The Busy Bulldozer , n.p. 66. Burton, Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel. 321</page><page sequence="17">TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE APRIL 2012 VOL. 53 of Burton's books, girls typically play relatively minor roles in them. Males dominate, either as operators or admiring, observant boys. The boys seem- ingly rehearse their own guardian roles as they accompany token female companions to view the machines in action. The example of a later work, Vermont Roadbuilder , proves the exceptional nature of female protagonists. In this self-proclaimed "non-sexist book," girls equally balance out boys, and one of them, Sarah, corrects two boys who claim that "girls never drive bulldozers" by replying that w[g]irls can do anything that boys can do." Then she climbs up to the backhoe's seat and drives it herself.67 Children's books portray construction men and their jobs as not only appealing in their exercise of masculine power, but also virtuous in their goals. As authors Zim and Skelly write in Tractors : "Even though the work is rough and the hours long, volunteers always are found among the bull- dozer men."68 Similarly commemorating workers' acts of self-sacrifice, Tear Down to Build Up describes the steel helmets the men wear for protection and quotes one workman, who observes that "[i]f you're really hit, nothing will save you. That's the chance you take." As another demolition worker notes: "I'm glad to have a hand in pulling down some of these old tene- ments. Someday there'll be a beautiful building there."69 Not only are the men removing old tenements, but they are also making the roads safer. As Cooke writes of highway builders: The crews of road builders have labored hard to finish the job, often working in pouring rain and blistering sun. It has been a struggle every inch of the way. They know that their highway will make driving easier for countless people for many years to come. They know that their highway will carry trucks taking all kinds of products to market, that it will take families to vacation areas faster and thus allow them to enjoy longer holidays. But perhaps most important of all, they know that they have built a safe highway.70 Despite the difficult, tiring, and oftentimes risky nature of their work, the operators impress by willingly shouldering the burdens of self-sacrifice for society's greater good. The books' authors dramatize both the blue-collar laborers who execute clearance projects and the white-collar professionals who plan and manage them. In this way, they offer readers multiple role models, from laborers to draftsmen and middle-class businessmen, while broadening the reach of masculinity in the process. As three young boys gaze smilingly upward at a white-collar worker in Hoists, Cranes , and Derricks , for example, they sug- gest their admiration. Let's Go to Build a Highway also begins with a draw- 67. Cappel and Montgomery, Vermont Roadbuilder &gt; 21-23. 68. Zim and Skelly, Tractors , 60. 69. Colby, Tear Down to Build Up, 22, 29. 70.

HEROICIZED AND ANTHROPOMORPHIZED MACHINES The ultimate heroes in these books are not the men, but the machines. By anthropomorphizing bulldozers and shovels, the authors extend valor, masculinity, and even humanity to the operators' mechanical counterparts. Anthropomorphism in children's literature is not new; mid-twentieth-cen- tury authors extended the nineteenth-century example set by Hans Chris- tian Andersen and others to the trains and earthmoving equipment of their own day. The animation of machines facilitates a personal connection be- tween the reader and the fictional characters, making them seem safer. As one critic has observed: "The machine that has a soul is not dangerous any- more; it is reasonable."73 Consequently, the authors transform construction vehicles from scary mechanical monsters into valiant all- American friends. The fictional machines' many heroic exploits demonstrate civic service. Benny the Bulldozer saves the day by helping complete the roadway on time. In Burton's Katy and the Big Snowy snowplow Katy (a tractor equipped with a snow-clearing plow) rescues the city of Geopolis from a debilitating snow- storm (fig. 6). Katy's graphic depiction establishes her friendly nature: alert eyes replace headlights; her plow looks like a heart-shaped mouth; and red paint completes her loving, Valentine-esque appearance. But her actions truly endear her to the town. She clears off roadways to rescue the police, postmaster, electric and telephone companies, and water department; in the process, she also delivers a patient to a hospital emergency room. All were saved "thanks to what Katy did."74 The title character of Buster Bulldozer fur- ther proclaims that being helpful both pleases himself and serves others. Heading off on a new task at the end of the book, Buster sings: "Clankety clank! Clankety clank! / And soon the work is done! / Clankety clank! I'm helping now, / And this is lots of fun!"75 As the unheralded workhorses who keep the town running and the populace out of trouble, machines like Katy and Buster exemplify service.

All attempts to locate the copyright holder for this image were unsuccessful.) stone in Benny the Bulldozer also suggests a civic-oriented connection. Many of the books close with patriotic celebrations, their pages brimming with flags, government officials, and ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Through stories of publicly oriented work, the books promote patriotism and civic responsibility. Such one-dimensional personifications of these industrious workers, however, may not offer young readers an appropriate range of qualities for emulation. As one scholar has argued, in their nearly singular focus on work over play - eschewing adventure while toiling ceaselessly at demand- ing jobs - the machines can function as dangerous role models. Moreover, in addition to conveying a positive ethic of selflessness, such character traits privilege standardization over individuality and the common good over personal need.76 These trade-offs are also consistent with the philosophy underpinning the law of eminent domain: prioritizing a vaguely defined public good over individual property-owners' rights facilitated the demoli- tion of many preexisting structures that stood in the way of redevelopment projects. How Superhighways Are Made explains the doctrine in this way: 76. Schwarcz, "Machine Animism in Modern Children's Literature," 95. 324</page><page sequence="20">AMMON I Culture of Clearance in Children's Books "In some cases these landowners may not wish to sell their property. How- ever, a special law makes it possible for the government to buy their land anyway, because highways are considered to be so important to everybody. This law is called the 'Law of Eminent Domain.'"77 Through such overt text and the behavior of mechanical characters, these children's books offer ex- amples of some of the sacrifices that postwar citizenship increasingly required. Conservation and Criticism, 1960s and Beyond Although critics have targeted the bulldozer since its early days, by the 1960s and early 70s organized protest was yielding national changes. Both urban and suburban residents voiced disapproval of the large-scale clear- ance work of the past; they organized into movements supporting open space, environmentalism, building rehabilitation, and historic preserva- tion, which resulted in new legislation.78 Just as children's books from the 1940s through the '60s mirror the rise of the bulldozer during that earlier period, so texts from this later era convey the changed public attitude toward clearance that characterized subsequent decades. This dissent within the literature did not appear out of nowhere; there were always counter-narratives to the celebration of progress, even in books that initially seem consistent with the dominant trope.79 Burton con- veys this productive tension particularly effectively, as she buries Mike Mulligan in the same modernity he created and leaves the technotopia of Geopolis dependent on a single machine to survive the snow. Similarly, just as The Little House suggests the limitless nature of pastoral land, it also gloomily depicts the creative destruction of the city. Gray and black urban buildings contrast with the house's pink pastel, while building demolitions make way for taller structures that bring sadness and shadow to the Little House. Don Freeman's Fly High , Fly Low is similarly despondent about urban change. The book tells the love story of a pigeon and dove that make their home together in the letter "B" of the San Francisco Bay Hotel sign. When the pigeon comes home one day to discover that a crane has re- moved the sign, the reader feels the triple loss of his missing partner, their unhatched eggs, and the partially dismantled old building.80 During the 1960s and '70s authors increasingly introduced children's 77.

In 1970 Suzanne Hilton published How Do They Get Rid of It?, a chil- dren's book about finding reuses for old things. Although the author demonstrates an interest in recycling, she stops short of advocating a re- duction in demolition itself, even describing the process of building wreck- ing as an art on par with that of building construction.81 Still, Hilton dif- ferentiates her work by merely considering alternatives to disposing of the old in favor of the new. In another book, Mr. Bumba and the Orange Grove (1965) by Pearl Augusta Harwood, Bill, Jane, and Mr. Bumba learn of the impending clearance of a neighboring orange grove. Unlike earlier protag- onists, they lament rather than celebrate; then they develop a plan. Mr. Bumba convinces the grove owner to preserve small ribbons of trees in order to justify naming his new subdivision "Green Belt Manner." Noting that "people would pay more money for a place like that, with a name like that," the grove owner agrees.82 While this solution is accommodationist, it deftly manages emerging aesthetic and environmental aspirations within the economic constraints. The change in times also tempered the tone of some otherwise celebra- tory texts. Although Jack McClellan and Millard Black devote the bulk of What a Highway! (1967) to detailed descriptions of road-building work, they also touch briefly on the removal of residents and disruption to daily life that the process first entails. In two scenes about boys who get stuck while playing on the machines, they also try to impart respect for the dan- gers of heavy equipment.83 In Tractors (1972) Zim and Skelly momentarily interrupt their celebration of earthmoving machines to recognize some of their problems. While the authors never hint at such sentiments in their two previous books on related subjects, they concede toward the end of this later text: "Men and tractors are changing the world we live in rapidly. They are turning forests into farms, cultivating large areas of land, building roads and bridges. Until a few years ago, all of this work was considered to be good. It was part of our progress. Now we know that the world pays a high price for this kind of growth. When changes are too great, both land and water suffer."84 To remedy the potential damage to fish, wildlife, and natu- ral ecosystems, they entreat each of their readers - not just the machine operators - to consider the best path forward; in so doing, they attempt to involve readers in a quite different role than that of identifying future road- building sites. Nevertheless, the book concludes on a positive note: "These men are proud of the skill with which they operate their machines. They 81. Suzanne Hilton, How Do They Get Rid of It?, 39. 82.

While pictures remain, text dominates the multiple, brief chapters of their young adult works. Perhaps the more mature sensibilities of the in- tended readers, combined with the texts' longer length, better suited the more nuanced perspectives they present on the remaking of the landscape. The characters in Hila Colman's Andy's Landmark House (1969) respond variously to the planned demolition of a street of brownstones: from ex- citement over the new construction, to frustration about being depicted as a roadblock to progress, and finally to resignation about the futility of op- position. Only idealistic Andy remains committed to the belief that "no one had the right to bulldoze a good neighborhood. It would be like stepping on an anthill and wiping out a way of life."86 By researching the history of one of the buildings, he rallies the neighborhood into united opposition that saves both the structures and the community. By contrast, the lead character of another book, Toby Talboťs My House Is Your House (1970), fares more poorly in her contest with the bulldozer. In this story about an urban renewal project on Manhattan's West Side, young Juana and her fam- ily are some of the last to leave a neighborhood that is in forced, clearance- based transition. On her final walk along the block she sees some of the dirty undersides of urban clearance: "dust in the air and yellow mud in the streets from the dump trucks. Empty lots strewn with rubble and beer cans alternated with rows of condemned buildings."87 Unlike optimistic Andy, Juana feels that nothing can save her own building. Yet the story concludes more positively, with Juana finding solace in a new home on Long Island. Rather than channel her criticism of urban destruction into physical oppo- sition, Juana, like The Little House , just looks for a new place to call home. What My House Is Your House does highlight, however, is the potentially intimidating appearance of many wrecking and earthmoving machines. This nightmare vision is what makes the celebrated friendly depiction of bulldozers in many postwar books seem so surprising. Recall how the chil- dren in Vermont Roadbuilder played happily inside a bulldozer blade. The title page of Helen Palmer's Johnny's Machines , a Little Golden Book, simi- larly depicts a smiling toddler sitting inside a raised shovel bucket.88 P. D. Eastman's Are You My Mother? goes one step further. The baby bird in this story hatches from his egg and falls out of the nest while his mother is away. After asking various passers-by if they are, improbably, his mother, a power 85. Zim and Skelly, Tractorsy 61-63. 86. Hila Colman, Andy's Landmark House , 45. 87.

Snort lets the bird climb into his bucket and then lifts him back into his nest, where mother bird arrives home hap- pily to greet him.89 But not every child might look as favorably as do these young characters upon large and loud construction machines; alongside the excitement stimulated by heavy equipment at work lay the equally viable prospect of its evoking fear. My House Is Your House taps into this other perception. For example, during the last night in her West Side apart- ment, Juana has a terrible dream: She dreamed that there were crosses on her forehead, white crosses like the ones on the windows of the condemned buildings. In her dream she was running down a long, dark hallway trying to escape a bulldozer that was clanking after her. As she tried to run faster, the bulldozer came closer and closer. But her feet would not run. Suddenly, Juana felt wet with perspiration, and wet below. She forced herself to awaken to end the nightmare and found that she had wet her bed.90 Readers might look past this scene as a fiction from which they and Juana need only awaken to move on. Juana even enacts this solution by finding salvation in the sunlit space of the suburbs. Yet Robert Weaver's illustration of this traumatic scene, using dark colors and lines to create a claustropho- bic space, cements the text's overall negative depiction of the 1970s-era bulldozer (fig. 7). Other authors play upon the menacing fear lurking behind clearance work to craft an even less promotional take. One example is David Macau- lay's Unbuilding , published in 1980.91 Through his more critical, ironic, and complex point of view, Macaulay breaks with his predecessors, who had largely cast an uncritical eye upon the manmade reshaping of the physical and natural landscape. By eschewing the happy ending, the book forces readers to consider more direct responses to unwanted environmental changes; it also helps distinguish between construction and destruction, with the author trading in his admiration of the building process, as depicted in his earlier works, for a satirical tone in describing the process of structural undoing.92 Unbuilding is the fictional story of the physical deconstruction of the Empire State Building. It is the near future - 1989 - and an oil baron named Prince Ali has decided to purchase, dismantle, and relocate the landmark building to the Arabian desert as his new company headquarters. Many New Yorkers initially cringe at the news; but in typical American fashion Macau- 89. P. D. Eastman, Are You My Mother ? 90. Talbot, My House Is Your House, 33. 91.

Once the prince offers the city regular supplies of oil for taxis and buses, he seals the deal. The demolition firm Krunchit and Sons spends the next three years taking down the building. Then a tanker loaded with its dismantled ele- ments sets off, only to sink just a short distance away from its final destina- tion. The entire cargo is lost. Even as he stops short of stating it explicitly, Macaulay makes his disdain evident. His narrative suggests the wastefulness of dismantling a functioning building that is less than sixty years old. The story concludes with the opening of Empire State Park in place of the now lost building, but Macaulay does not end his epic on this relative high note; instead, he leaves readers with a more ominous image by depicting a night- time view of midtown Manhattan with a black rectangular void where the 329</page><page sequence="25">TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE APRIL 2012 VOL. 53 Empire State Building stands half-disassembled. In the last lines of the text he returns to Prince Ali on the morning after the park's opening: "Prince Ali left for home. As his airplane rose swiftly into the sky he settled back on his reclining throne and turned his thoughts to the next . . . meeting, at which he would present Krunchiťs estimate for the dismantling of the Chrysler building [sic]!'93 Unbuilding shows how far children's bulldozer books have come since the early postwar years; it also demonstrates the advancements in demoli- tion techniques, which were increasingly incorporating deconstruction and recycling alongside the physical destruction. Macaulay's detailed drawings depict the work as more complex than earlier grunting and "grring" ma- chines suggested, following a trend among his recent antecedents to em- phasize the equipment's technological feats over animated faces. The text also reflects other cultural preoccupations of its age, from fears surrounding the 1970s oil crisis to anxiety over the invasion of foreigners and foreign goods. In many other respects, however, Unbuilding follows the example of its predecessors. Macaulay deploys clearance as a lens onto technological progress, calls upon readers to become involved in the decision-making sur- rounding clearance, and uses male characters as reflections of the inherent value of the work. Nonetheless, the book's overall tone is changed. Benny the Bulldozer cel- ebrates the bulldozer and the singularly positive value of its work; it de- scribes how the little machine clears a forest to make way for a roadway, and then showcases everyone's enthusiasm with the result. Although Macaulay's detailed drawings and text offer a similar, and even greater, education in how the machines of demolition and clearance work, he shuns triumphal- ism for a more thoughtful attitude about the role of demolition in society. He makes this distinction clearest on the book's dedication page. Recall the earlier works that authors often dedicated to future road-builders every- where; by contrast, Macaulay's Unbuilding goes out "to those of us who don't always appreciate things until they're gone."94 Conclusion: The Culture of Clearance In his recent study of postwar urban renewal, historian Samuel Zipp identifies a "set of philosophies, practices, and principles" that he calls an "ethic of city rebuilding."95 Taking one step backward in the building proc- ess, however, suggests a corollary: a bulldozer-centric ethic focused on de- struction as much as rebuilding. This is the culture of clearance that authors 93. Macaulay, Unbuildingy 78. 94. Ibid., 1. 95. Zipp, Manhattan Projects , 12. 330</page><page sequence="26">AMMON I Culture of Clearance in Children's Books reflect in children's books and that earthmoving and wrecking crews real- ized on the landscape. Yet the culture of clearance was not only a corollary to the ethic of city rebuilding, but it was also more expansive. Physically, it transformed the built environments of cities and the natural environments within and outside them; it also permeated other realms, from representa- tional forms to the spaces of the military, business, and politics. World War II nurtured the culture of clearance through the application and glori- fication of bulldozers; it advanced technology, trained laborers, rehearsed practices, and lent practical and visual valence to destruction on a scale pre- viously unimaginable. After hostilities ceased, an ideology of destruction rooted in wartime necessity came home to find postwar domestic applica- tions. Along with children's literature, popular forms like newspaper arti- cles, photo essays, and advertisements promoted the progress embedded in "cleaning" blighted cities and developing underutilized land outside of them. Federal legislation economically incentivized the real-world pursuit of these representations, while the growing equipment manufacture and wrecking and earthmoving industries provided the technical expertise to make them a reality. Vast destruction followed. Once the ensuing urban and suburban transformations attracted large, organized protest, they helped bring the bulldozer's national postwar heyday to a close. While we know much about the political and economic ties between the postwar transfor- mations of cities and suburbs, children's books begin to reveal further con- nections. Business, technology, practice, and culture also united these di- verse geographies in a common pursuit of large-scale destruction.96 96.
