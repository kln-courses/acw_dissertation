<plain_text><page sequence="1">51 RES BIBLIOGRAPH ICAE Atrahasis : The Babylonian Story of the Flood (*) William L. Moran - Cambridge, Massachusetts Although almost a century has passed since George Smith announced his sensational discovery of "the Chaldean account" of the Deluge, until very recently our understanding of the story was seriously hampered - more seriously, it turns out, than we realized - by our meager knowledge of the broader context in which the cataclysm was conceived. In the intervening years, it is true, it had become clear that what Smith had dis- covered, the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic, was derivative. How- ever, of the Old Babylonian source, which we had learned from a scribal note consisted of three tablets totaling 1245 lines, only about 200 had been recovered, and these were pretty much disjecta membra f1). There was also a Middle Babylonian fragment of little importance, and Assur- banipal's library had yielded a few fragments of later Assyrian recensions, the largest of which, by confusion of the obverse and reverse of the tablet, was being read in the wrong order; this error, until corrected by Laessoe in 1956 (2), not surprisingly resulted in some serious misunderstanding. Finally, a Sumerian version was known, but only one-third (about 100 lines) was preserved and the breaks were at crucial points (3). (*) A review article of W. G. Lambert and A. R.

Moran In the last five years the situation just described has been radically changed, thanks mainly to the work of Lambert and Millard (x). What is most important is that now, instead of 200, we have well over 700 lines of the Old Babylonian version. Happily, too, they throw light just where our ignorance had previously been particularly distressing; we now have a clear picture of the events leading to the creation of man and some idea of the measures taken by the gods after the Deluge. In fact, using with due caution the later recensions together with the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic, we can now draw a fairly detailed outline of the Old Babylonian story. The main sequence of events is clear and the roles of the principal protagonists are in much sharper focus. We are, therefore, on much firmer ground than we had been when we approach the problem of what the Atrahasis Epic as a whole is all about. It is to this central question that we shall confine our remarks here. First, a short outline of the story. The epic begins at a period when, prior to the creation of man, some of the gods were forced to provide the labor necessary for the sustenance of their fellow deities. This they do on earth, Enlil' s domain, while Anu resides in the heavens above and Enki in the fresh waters below. However, after a period of forty years or perhaps longer (2), they find the work intolerable, they revolt, and eventually they prove adamant in their refusal to continue as the labor-force for the other gods. It is Enki who solves the dilemma by proposing the creation of man. His proposal is accepted by the gods and then carried out with his help by the mother-goddess. But even this solution proves not altogether satisfactory. Before 1200 years have elapsed, man is acting in such a way that Enlil is deprived of his sleep. He tries to solve the problem by sending a series (three) of plagues, but each is rendered ineffective by Enki, who as the personal god of Atrahasis advises his servant how man can avert the plagues or at least survive them (8). This leads Enlil to the desperate measure of the Deluge. and tradition may be assumed; cf. B. Landsberger, Gilgamesh et sa légende , ed. P. Gareni, 34. The fact that in the Old Babylonian version the god of fresh waters is, with the single exception of CT 44,20, con- sistently called by his Sumerian (Enki) rather than his Semitic (Ea) name, may point to dependence on a Sumerian source; however, it should be noted that Sumerian provenience would not adequately explain the anomaly. i1) In CT 46 Lambert and Millard published fifteen Old Babylonian and Late Assyrian copies (some of them had been published previously) . In the present volume, Lambert adds an Old Babylonian fragment (pls. 1-6), more Late Assyrian and Neo-Late Babylonian material (pls. 4, 5, 9-10; pp. xi-xii), a new copy of the Old Babylonian text published by Boissier in RA 28, and a list of collations (pl. 11). Through the courtesy of J. Nougayroi,, Ugaritica V, No. 167 (pp. 300-304) could also be included. Most recently, in Or n.s. 38 (1969) 533-538, Lambert has published another small but important fragment of an Assyrian recension. (2) See von Soden, Or N.s. 38 (1969) 422, n. 1. (8) To be exact, these last remarks apply only to the first and second</page><page sequence="3">Atrahasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood 53 Again, as in the Gilgamesh Epic, Enki thwarts Enlil of his purpose, and Atrahasis and his family survive. On the basis of the Gilgamesh Epic and the Sumerian version, we may assume that they are given immortality , but the text that is preserved is largely concerned, it seems, with carrying out Enlil's commission to Enki and the mother-goddess to put their heads together and to plan a post-diluvian order that allows for man, but on terms acceptable to Enlil. With this brief and purposely vague outline we may now turn to the problem of understanding. Since the appearance of the new material two interpretations have been proposed (x). According to G. Pettinato the words hubüru and rigmu, which are used to explain Enlil's sleeplessness, do not mean simply "din" and "cry," but connote evil conduct - in context, man's rebellious protest against his lot of having to toil for the gods. Hence in this view man is clearly a sinner and Enlil is more than justified in sending the plagues and, eventually, the Deluge (2) . For W. von Soden, the epic does not express itself unambiguously on man's guilt, and he finds its general import, in nuce, in the very first line, inüma ilü awîlum, which he renders "Als die Götter (auch noch) Mensch waren" (3). This he understands to mean that, in the poet's conception, there was a stage in the evolution from chaos in which the gods, though of course never simply men, were much more like men than they became and remained after the Deluge. He finds this view implied and elaborated in many anthropomorphisms, the first being that gods worked, suffered and rebelled. Despite considerable lacunae at the end, he believes we may assume that, in the new and present order of things, the poet had the gods put away their many too, too human traits. plagues. In the third plague Enki apparently intervenes in a some- what different manner: see LamberT-MĪllard . tro. 78 ff. (*) Of course there is a considerable literature on this subject prior to the recent discoveries. In Lambert-Millard there is a detailed outline of the contents with a number of exegetical remarks, but there is no synthesis or comprehensive interpretation. In fact, admirable as this work is in many ways, it is frequently disappointing where interpre- tation is concerned; many lines that cry for some word of explanation are completely ignored in the commentary. According to R. Caprice, Or N.S. 38 (1969) 482-483, Elena Cassin in La splendeur divine (Paris 1968), at present still inaccessible to the writer, sees in "the noise which disturbed the gods. . . a sign of the teeming vitality of life, with the suggestion that the conflict of generations is a motive force in both epics [ Enūma elíš and Atrahasis]" . This is close to our own view, but we would emphasize the chaotic nature of the noise in the antediluvian stage (see below). (2) Or N.S. 37 (1968) 165-200, and see especially 188-189. Pettinato is of course not the first to interpret man's conduct as sinful. See, e.g., Speiser, ANET , p. 104 ("a large epic cycle dealing with man's sins and his consequent punishment through plague and the deluge"); HEiDEiy, The Gilgamesh Epic and Old Testament Parallels 2 (Chicago 1949), 225, 268; L. Matouš, ArOr 35 (1967) 8. (3) Or N.S. 38 (1969) 415-432, and see especially 419-427.</page><page sequence="4">54 W. L. Moran Though both scholars have in our opinion rightly stressed important features of the epic, we accept neither interpretation. Pettinato's we reject as based largely on a misunderstanding of Enki's advice during the first and second plagues: Order the heralds to cry, Let them silence the roar in the land. Do not reverence your gods. Do not pray to your goddess(es). Namtar (Adad, resp.), seek his gate, Bring a baked-loaf before it, Let the meal-offering please him, So that, embarrassed at the gifts, He will raise his hand (x) . These lines, we submit, do not urge a bold non serviam against the gods in general ("praktisch eine Kampfsansage an die Götter'') (2), or a ' 'Straf - massnahme" that man in an earlier order of things may dare to take against his still not absolute masters (8). The unlikelihood that the people are to be told to cut off all cult to the gods with the exception of Namtar or Adad, should at least be suspected in view of the one who gives the advice. It is the clever, wily, devious Enki. This is the god who evades his oath and warns Atrahasis of the final impending disaster by speaking, not to him, but to a wall. He is the one who, in the face of a revolt, does not think of arms but conceives the new thing, man. It is he, too, who finds the compromise that establishes the post-diluvian order. This is not a god of bold con- frontations. He is the sly diplomat, and it would be completely out of character if he were to urge man to a kind of showdown of power, and a necessarily futile one to boot. Furthermore, why bother bribing Namtar and Adad, and why insist that the latter act so stealthily (4), if there is to be an open rebellion which will force Enlil to relent? Not only is there not the slightest indication that Enlil ever felt compelled to reconsider his decisions, but when the gods suffer hunger cramps in the days of the Deluge, this seems a completely new experience for them, an unforeseen consequence (!) Tabi. I 376-383 (LamberT-Mii,i,ard, pp. 68-69), Tabi. II 15'-15 ( Lambert-Mill ard, pp. 74-75): qibâmãmi lissû nãgirú / rigma líšebbú ina mātim I ê taplahā ilīkun / ê tusalliã ištarkun / Namtar a (Adad, resp.) šiá bābšu I bilā epīta ana qudmîëu / lillikšu mashatum niqû / lībāšma ina katrê I Itšaqqil qãssu. The expression rigma Šubbú (šuppú) could also mean "to raise a loud cry", and is so understood by Lambert-Millard and Pettinato. However, in view of the problem the rigmu of the people had already creatèd, it seems much more likely that the heralds are not to be told to add to the noise but rather to go about putting it down. (2) So Pettinato, Or 37, 189. (8) So von Soden, Or 38, 427. How these lines can be taken, as Matouš, Ar Or 35, 8, does, as an attempt to persuade the people to worship, escapes us. (4) See Tabi. II ii 16-19 (LamberT-Miixard, pp. 74-75).</page><page sequence="5">Atrahasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood 55 of their following Enlil in his determination to annihilate man. This is hard to reconcile with alleged earlier periods of deprivation. All of these problems disappear with the observation that the text speaks of " your gods" and "your goddess (es)", not simply of gods and goddesses. As almost countless examples show, this is the usual way of referring to personal gods (1). If the poet had wished to include all the gods, he would almost certainly not have used the pronominal suffix; hence, apart from all the difficulties that a reference to the entire pantheon causes here, it is not in itself a very probable reading of the text. Ob- viously, too, in our view Enki's counsels are duly clever and devious, really worthy of him: first of all, quiet down, then neglect for a time your individual gods and goddesses, concentrate the cult you would ordinarily give to them on the god afflicting you, making him a kind of universal personal god, until he is so embarrassed by your attentions that he either desists or adopts some way of nullifying the effects of the plague (a). There is, therefore, no hint of rebellion in the rigmu of this passage, and so such a connotation may not be read into the word, as Pettinato does, when it is found in the introduction to Enlil' s complaint before the first and second plagues (3) : The land grew extensive, The people numerous, The land was bellowing like a bull. At their din the god was distressed. Enlil heard their cry. He addressed the great gods, "The cry of mankind has become burdensome to me, Because of their din I am deprived of sleep" (4). (x) See CAD I/J, pp. 95 ff.; cf. too il amēli and il abi, p. 95. In Tabi. III i 42 (LamberT-Mi^ard, pp. 90-91) Enlil is called "your god", not that he is the personal god of all the people, but because of the contrast between Enlil and Enki, the personal god of Atrahasis (ill, "my god"). (a) Note the interesting parallel to our passage m an Old Babylonian letter (R. Frankena, Altbabylonische Briefe, Heft II, No. 118, pp. 82- 83 = V AB VI, No. 97, pp. 86-87) which reports on which god is causing the deaths in the city and orders a herald to proclaim assemblies (?) of all the people in honor of the god and prayers to him until he is ap- peased.

Pettinato would have Enlü uneasy and fearful, mindful as he must be of the trouble he experienced earlier with the gods. However, though nďduru (itta'dar) at times certainly denotes the specific distress of fear, Enlil's speech is not that of someone afraid. The cry of mankind is a burden, not a source of any alarm,</page><page sequence="6">56 W. L. Moran The obvious meaning is that an ever-increasing population had resulted in such a din and racket that sleep became impossible, and this meaning, we maintain, is the correct one (x). For, first of all, why mention in each case the size of the population unless it is somehow connected with the "din" and "cry"? (2) Furthermore, in the introduction to the second plague in an Assyrian recension, Enlil first notes "The people have not diminished, their numbers are more excessive than before" (8), then goes on to complain of his distress and sleeplessness due to the "cry" and "din". The numbers of the people and the noise could hardly be associated more closely (4). And, finally, that the problem of man, at least in part, lies precisely in his numbers is to be seen from the fact that in the post-diluvian order provision will be made for the existence of sterile as well as fertile women, of a demon that will snatch children from their mothers and thus insure a high infant mortality rate, and of institutions of religious women who may not marry - all obvious mea- sures of population-control (5). These criticisms do not imply that Pettinato is wrong in stressing the importance of the din and cry of the people, or even in considering them an evil. His mistake is trying to make them a moral evil, sin (6). In this he runs against all the evidence. The Atrahasis Epic ignores almost completely the ideas of sin and punishment, and it is not in any sense a theodicy, a justification of EnliTs ways with man. If man's sinfulness were the issue, then he should be charged with sin, but nowhere is man's responsibility expressed in terms of moral culpability. There is not a single mention of sin, a subject for which Akkadian has a rich lexical stock, until after the Deluge, when Enki defends himself before and Enlil appears in complete control of the situation when he goes on to state the specific measures to be taken to rid himself of this burden. i1) The interpretation we defend is, of course, not new. (2) Pettmato (Or 38, 183) speaks vaguely of the syntax of the passage as militating against any close connection between the size of the population and the reason for Enlil's anger. (8) [niš~'ū lā imtâ ana ša pana ittatrā , LambeRT-Mii^ard , p. 108, line 39. (4) Pettinato (Or 38, 183) dismisses this passage as irrelevant on the grounds that the situation is different in the two cases and adds "s. unten". We can discover nothing (pp. 191-192?) that would support any relevant distinction between the situations described in the two passages. (5) LamberT-Miixard, pp. 102-103, lines 1-9. Note also m [the Assyrian recension the last purpose (and effect) of the second plague: closed wombs giving birth to no children (LamberT-Mii,i,ard, pp. 108- 111, lines 51, 61). (6) See the perceptive remarks of Paul Ricoeur, The Symbolism of Evil (Religious Perspective Series, XVIII [trans, by Emerson Buchanan] Boston 1969) 184-187. He also notes: " That the intention of the myth [Atrahasis] is not to illustrate the wickedness of men is confirmed further by its insertion in the famous Epic of Gilgamesh. The quest of Gilgamesh has nothing to do with sin, but only with death, completely stripped of all ethical significance, and with the desire for immortality" (p. 187).</page><page sequence="7">Atrahasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood 57 the divine assembly and bitterly reproaches Knlil for a wanton destruction that ignored all distinction between innocent and guilty (*). If this brief reference suggests that the poet was not altogether unaware of deeper problems the Deluge might pose, it also shows that in the actions of Knlil and the people, which throughout involve only indiscriminate global masses, he has not faced them. He is definitely no Job (2). But man was involved in disorder, though one that ultimately was not of his own making. What man produced, rigmu, is not in itself an evil; (3), in fact, it is characteristically human, evidence of man's pre- sence, and its absence suggests devastation (4). However, in antedilu- (x) Tabi. III vi 16 fí., especially 25-26 (L,amberT-Mii,i,ard, pp. 100- 101). Though unfortunately the text is badly broken at this point, enough can be made out to establish that Bnki's defense, in part at least, is substantially the one he makes in Gilg. XI 180 ff. It is difficult to see how Heidel (see above, p. 53, n. 2) can find in the latter passage proof that the Deluge is a punishment for sin. Bnki's reproach is precisely that Bnlil ignored ethical considerations, and this is borne out by everything we know of the Deluge, which from its conception was intended to destroy man utterly, something it could not have done had sin been taken account of. It is to be admitted that the reference to sin in Bnki's speech comes somewhat unexpectedly, which explains why von Soden (ZD MG 89 [1935] 153, n. 4) once felt that Bnki's speech in Gilg. XI is a later ad- dition. However, if there is an underlying polemic against Bnlil through- out the epic (see below), Bnki's speech may be seen as its culmination, a revelation of Bnlil's character as Brutal force. (2) Nor should it be inferred from the piety of Atrahasis towards his personal god that the poet represents more conventional views. Atra- hasis may be duly rewarded by Bnki, but nothing suggests that the rest of the people are rightly treated as a massa damnata. (8) The word runs like a theme throughout the epic. It first occurs when the rebelling gods are shouting outside Bnlil's house (Tabi. I 77, Lambert- Miiyi, ARD, p. 46), then in reference to their forced labor (Tabi. I 179, Iv amberT- Miiyiy ARD , p. 52). It reappears at man's creation, in an unfortunately still obscure line (Tabi. I 242, LamberT-Mii^ard , p. 60; cf. also Tabi. II vii 32, LAMBERT-MiiyiyARD , p. 84). As we have seen, it denotes the main issue of the plagues. When the Deluge comes, rigmu is the thunder of the storm (Talbl. Ill ii 50, LamberT-Miij.ard, p. 92; iii 20 [?], 23, LamberT-Mii^ard, p. 94, and cf. p. 124, line 20), the noise of the land (Tabi. III iii 10, LamberT-Miij,ard, p. 92), the cries of the people (Tabi. III iii 43, L amberT-Mii^Iv ard , p. 94), the lament of the mother-goddess (Tabi. III iii 47, L ambERT-Mii^ard , p. 94). - A similar range of meaning is attested in the omen literature (see J. Nougayroi,, RA 44 [1950] 26). In En. el. the rigmu of the younger gods is one source of the confusion that so disturbs old Apsû; it is perhaps to be taken here as evidence of the excessive exuberance and vitality of youth. In no case is it a war-cry (Pettinato, Or 38, 196), and what is emphasized is how painful and distressing the conduct of the young gods was; nothing is said that in any way suggests an ethical judgment on it (lā tabat in line 28 is not " nicht gut" [Pettinato], but "not pleasant"; note the parallelism with imtarsamma "had become painful", in the previous line, and see Y. Muffs' remarks in Studies in the Legal Papyri from Elephantine [Studia et documenta ad iura orientis antiqui perti- nente, VIII; Leiden 1969] 136 f.). (4) Cf. rigim amelüti kibis alpi u sēni šisīt alala tabi uzammâ ūgārīšu, " I deprived his commons of the noise of men, the stamping of cattle</page><page sequence="8">58 W. L. Morati vian days its volume was monstrous and chaotic. That the poet thought of it in these terms is seen in the identical descriptions of the land before the Deluge and of the Deluge-storm itself, when chaos breaks upon the world; "it was bellowing like a bull" (1). But the form of chaos, with its chronic disorder and crises, that man's existence entailed was inevitable as long as man's procreative powers - behind which we should see his creators, Enki and the mother- goddess - went unchecked. The teeming masses that necessarily re- sulted could not fail to produce a din that was intolerable to Enlil, who, it should be noted, is never censured for taking some limited measures against it. What is lacking prior to the Deluge is a balance of powers, the balance that obtains in the present order of things. The origin of this balance is, in our opinion, the central question of the Atrahasis Epic, which accordingly we consider as fundamentally a cosmogonie myth. The answer defines man's established place in the universe. And unlike its Sumerian counterpart, which is also con- cerned with the origins of cities and kingship, the Atrahasis Epic is not interested in man's political or social institutions; at least in the text as preserved they are ignored, or if they are mentioned at all, they are mentioned only in passing, as vestiges of an earlier tradition. Rather, Atrahasis looks solely to what we may call the most essential man: his very being, his origin, his function, and his experience, at the deepest level of his existence, of forces in a tension that allow him to be, but not without measure. Hence the long account of his creation, with unparalleled detail and precision on the composition of man and on the nature and function of the divine element within him. (a). Hence, too, the interest in childbirth and in customs associated with it (8). But and flocks, the cry of the pleasant work-song" (VAB VII, p. 56, vi 101 ff; for variants see CAD A/I, p. 328b). The few occurrences of hubüru suggest that it too was the noise typical of heavily populated" areas. (x) Tabi. III iii 15 (Lambert-Medard, pp. 94-95). Note, too, the use of rigmu for the thunder of the storm and the noise of the land that the storm puts an end to (see n. 27). (2) We shall elaborate our views on the creation of man in BASOR no. 200, Dec. 1970. (8) LamberT-Mii^ard, pp. 60-65. On lines 389 ff. we would follow the suggestion (private communication) of Thorkild Jacobsen that in line 290 the qadištum is the mother after childbirth - LambERT-Mii^ard, without comment: "Let the midwife rejoice in the prostitute's house" - and that the whole passage deals, first, with a nine day celebration after childbirth in honor of the mother-goddess, then (299 ff.) with the resump- tion of sexual relations. On this basis we would propose that in line 299 the date of the latter is given ( ina UD X.KAM, "on the X day") and that in line 300 we restore li-ih-ti-[ļ&gt;u, "let the woman and her husband purify each other (themselves ? ) ' ' . The LamberT-Mii&lt;i,ard read- ing has been rightly criticized by von Soden (Or N.S. 38 [1969] 425-426, n. 2), but his own proposal, lihtī[da], "let them speak with one another", yields, in our opinion, a meaning much too unspecific for the context. The purification we propose could refer to rites freeing the woman of her taboo and the man of any pollution through contact with her. The</page><page sequence="9">Atrahasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood 59 all is not conducive to man's being and growth. Some women are sterile, from others a demon snatches their infants, and there are even women who in the service of the gods forego marriage. There are, too, disease and famine i1). Whence all this? The answer is the order of things established by the gods after the Deluge, an order which represents a compromise agreeable to both parties of the struggle that had gone on at the highest level of the pantheon and had led to the Deluge, Enlil supported by Anu on one side, Enki and the mother-goddess on the other. The Deluge is, therefore, an event in the long process by which the cosmos emerged. It is as much a thing of the past as the revolt of the suffering gods. It constitutes no threat to man and its recurrence is unthinkable. But it is also a supremely important event, for it revealed to the gods their need of man. They should have known this before they suffered hunger cramps, for their own efforts at self-support had issued in the fateful impasse that led to man's creation. But unthinking, they had supported the foolish and irresponsible decision of Enlil. The Atrahasis Epic is an assertion of man's importance in the final order of things. It is also a strong criticism of the gods, and in the case of Enlil one should perhaps even speak of polemic (a). The attack on him is use of the G stative of hiãpum in connection with love ( KAR 158 rev. ii 11) and sex appeal (W.~ G. Lambert, Or n.s. 36 [1967] 122:96, 120; 124: 125) is certainly relevant, but a more general meaning, "fair, handsome", seems to have developed; cf. namrum, "shining" &gt; "perfect, in excellent condition". However, attractive as Jacobsen's suggestion on qadištu in line 290 may be - and note the late variant harištu, woman in con- finement ( L amberT-Mii^ ARD , 62:15) - , also to be noted are the Middle Assyrian evidence (E. Weidner, AfO 17/2 [19561 268:11) associating the qadištu (qadiltu)A'motion with the midwife, and the Old Babylonian evidence for a qadištu serving as a nurse (see most recently, W. von Soden, AfO 18/1 [19571 121). (x) We assume that they are to be understood as remaining, even if they may not be mentioned explicitly in Enki's plans for the future; cf. Ea's speech in Gilè. XI 180 ff. (2) Where we differ from von Soden is mainly in holding that the poet's criticism is directed against the gods only as sources of disorder; hence anthropomorphic aspects of the divine such as holding assemblies, casting lots, etc., are not his target. Specifically, we do not believe that the first line of the epic speaks of the gods in general; they are clearly only the gods who toil (line 2) and whose corvée-labor is great (line 3). We agree, too, with Lambert (Or n.s. 38 [1969] 535) that von Soden does not prove that awilum as a predicate means that the gods had only some human characteristics, whereas awilü (pl.) or awïlûtum (abstract) would have implied they were simply men. On the other hand, we do not believe that to say some gods were men is "nugatory" or "nonsense" (Lambert, ibid.). A poet is permitted metaphor as well as simile, and in this case he quickly explains the deliberately bold identification by presenting the gods as laborers. It is this implied functional view of man that dominates the account of his creation. Nor, in our opinion, is the evidence as yet clear enough to assert that locative -um can mean "like" (see Lambert's latest arguments, ibid., 536). Hence, for the present at least, we would translate the opening line "When (some) gods were mankind".</page><page sequence="10">60 W. L. Moran most evident in the speeches of Enki and the mother-goddess after the Deluge; as we have seen, the former accuses him of wanton destruction, and the latter charges him, so frequently called "the counsellor of the gods" { mālik ili), of not having taken counsel (mitluku) (x). And through- out the epic Enlil cuts a sorry figure. He is not only "the counsellor of the gods" but qurãdu Enlil , "the warrior Enlil" (2), an epithet he often enjoys, and yet when his house is besieged by the rebel gods, the only occasion he has to display his valor, he pleads with his attendant Nusku for protection, and cowers behind him in fear (3). Confronted with the stubbornness of the rebels, he breaks into tears and would resign his office and go off with Anu to heaven (4). Throughout the crisis he is singularly inept; it is Nusku, Anu or Enki who must suggest courses of action. He also seems blind to what is evident to both Anu and Enki, the justice of the gods' complaint (5). When he does act, as in the plagues and the Deluge, he is thwarted of his purpose again and again by the crafty Enki. And finally, when Enki attacks him after the Deluge, he cannot offer a single word in defense of himself and can only ask Enki to work out with the mother-goddess some new scheme of things. In brief, Enlil is seen as a power, with his legitimate domain on earth, but a power seriously flawed by fear, childish resentment, a certain obtuseness, and, above all, a wrath that can issue in completely irresponsible violence (8). But all the gods, with the possible exception of Enki, share to some extent in the poet's criticism. Anu is expressly mentioned by the mother- goddess, and she does not spare herself for her own part in the catastrophe that overtook her children (7). No one, in fact, escapes her bitter reproaches, for all consented to the Deluge. And, though caution is in place here, one may wonder if the poeťs criticism does not become contempt when he has the gods thirsty and suffering hunger cramps, then swarming later on like flies about Atrahasis' sacrifice. Behind this criticism we should probably see with Landsberger the intellectual climate of "the Tablet House", the Babylonian "uni- versity " (8). It supposes an " enlightenment", assertive of man's place f1) The mālik ill references are listed in LambERT-Mii^ard, p. 188. For Enlil who did not take counsel, see Ťabl.

We cannot say, however, whether the Atrahasis Kpic reflects in its attitude and in its particular expression of this attitude any specific political or social si- tuation p). We have lingered over the problem of understanding the Atrahasis Kpic, to the apparent neglect of the main interest of the reader of Biblica, the relevance of the new discoveries for the Old Testament (2) . However, though we must leave the discussion of the latter question to others, it should be immediately evident that the results of our inquiry, if correct, heighten the contrast between the Mesopotamian and biblical traditions. Non only is the stress in the Old Testament on man's depravity as the cause of the Deluge still unparalleled, but the respective resolutions of the conflict are now seen to be completely different. In the particular form we have of the Mesopotamian tradition, the post-diluvian order represents a correction of an earlier imbalance in the cosmos, an adjustment necessary to achieve stability and to overcome an inherent disorder. The correction is the limitation of man's growth. Viewed in this light, Gn 9,1 ff. looks like a conscious rejection of the Atrahasis Epic (3). God's first words to man after the Deluge are a repetition of Gen 1,28, the command to be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth. There is no going back on this command, for the problem of man lies elsewhere, in his evil inclination (Gn 8,21). (*) Von Soden suggests (Or 38, 429) that the background of the conflict between the laboring gods and the others is the severe burden of toil laid upon the incoming Semitic Amorites in the Ur III period by the older inhabitants; see also Iraq 28 (1966) 144-145. (2) For the present, see A. R. Mii^ard, Tyndale Bulletin 18 (1967) 3-18. (8) Whether the contrast here noted, which is in P, was paralleled in the J account cannot of course be known. Obviously, too, we cannot prove that the contrast is a conscious one. Conscious or not, it is evi- dence of a completely different view.</page></plain_text>
