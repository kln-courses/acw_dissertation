Huelke Dept. of Anatomy University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute Harold W. Sherman and Jamie L. Steigmeyer University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ABSTRACT The side impact, recently and currently the subject to of much debate, controversy and proposed NHTSA rule making, is a difficult type of crash to significantly reduce serious injuries and fatalités. Results from real-world crash investigations presents a confusing picture for the near-side passenger compartment crash. A direct relationship between the amount of crush and injury severity levels (MAIS) is not apparent. Exemplar cases of tow-a-way/injury crashes are presented at all AIS injury level of drivers in crashes with direct driver door crush damage. The near side-impact, at the driver's door, has recently been an concern of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Data have shown a relatively high occurrance of serious injuries and deaths in side impact types of crashes. Crash data have been analyzed, crash tests conducted, and anthropomorphic dummy responses to side impact have been argued. To provide a basis for classification of the extent of vehicle deformation caused by highway vehicular crashes, the Collision Deformation Classification (CDC) - SAE Recommended Practice J224MAR80--was developed. Studies of collision deformation can then be performed using data banks with assurance that the data are essentially the same for each size and class of car from the various field data sources. The classification system consists of seven characters, three numeric, and four alphabetic, arranged in a specific order. The characters describe the deformation detail concerning the principal direction of force, location on the vehicle, size of the deformed area, and the extent of the damage. Side impacts are described using the characters depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1 From Figure 1, it can be seen that a "side" impact is not a side impact! An impact into the left side of the car can be centered at the left front fender, behind the passenger compartment, located at the driver door, or anywhere between the bumpers. Using the NASS file as the side impact data base, and using a variable of "unrestrained drivers", and a "side" impact with a 3 or 9 o'clock impact direction, one finds 3293 cases (Fig. 2). The data base already has been thinned down by specifying the clock direction of the impact and an unrestrained driver. As can be noted, the finer the filter(s) used, the smaller the data base on which to make décidions. For example, in left side impacts, using the 1st and/or 2nd CDC-'side' codes, the N=668. But if only the primary CDC is used, the N decreases by 50%, to 348 cases. Eliminating any influence of passengers on driver injury in these cases, and the influence of ejection, the data base is further reduced by 29% . And finally, if only "pure" left side passenger compartment impacts are selected, and 9 o'clock impacts are sought, then only 30 cases are available in all the NASS 80-86 files. The data show, as would be anticipated, that the more severe injuries and fatalities increase in frequency in cases where the passenger compartment is involved (Fig. 1). If all the "left" side impacts are sorted and reviewed, 481</page><page sequence="2">Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 8 Figure 9 482</page><page sequence="3">then the AIS 3-5 + K frequency varies between 10 and 13%, irrespective of whether there is a 2nd CDC or not. However, when there is definately some passenger compartment involvement, the frequency of the more severe or fatal injuries increases to 18%. And, if only the passenger compartment is involved, the cases are few in number with 9 of the 30 drivers having AIS 3-5 + K injuries. As indicated previously, the frequency of injuries of the more severe nature (AIS 3-5 + K) is relatively low. The body areas involved have a low number count, but certain body areas seem to predominate. The head/face or chest show a higher count of MAIS 3-5 + K level injuries than the abdomen or lower extremity (excluding the pelvis). Of all the various crash types-frontal, rollover, rear, etc., the side impact is probably the most difficult to understand, to appreciate, and to "improve" for significant injury reduction. From field investigations of motor vehicle crashes it is difficult to show a direct correlation between door crush, intrusion, and driver injury in near side impacts. CASE HISTORIES The following are cases of passenger compartment impacts at the driver's door, selected on the basis of intrusion and AIS. The first grouping are drivers with AIS-1 level injuries involved in crashes with noticable passenger compartment deformation. AIS-1 Level Crashes Case l-UM-1116 1975 Buick Sky hawk Car/Tree CDC 09-LPAW-3 This out of control 1975 Buick Skyhawk went off the road and struck a 36 cm diameter tree producing left side door crush of 30 cm (Fig. 3 ). Upon impact the 18 year old unrestrained female driver (160 cm, 45 kg) contacted the left door and armrest (laceration left frontal scalp, contusion left thigh), lower instrument panel (contusion left knee), impact force (stiff neck) and broken glass (laceration to the left elbow and 1st finger of the left hand)-MAIS-l. Case 2- UM- 1604 1978 Buick Regal Car/Car CDC 09-LYAW-4 In this collision a 1 969 Chevrolet Nova ran a red light and struck the left side of a 1978 Buick Regal. The impact speed of the Nova was estimated to be 38-50 kmph. There was extensive damage to the left side of the Regal where the maximum crush was 66 cm to the door (Fig. 4). On impact the 21 year old unrestrained male driver (196 cm, 117 kg) contacted the left door and armrest (laceration left arm, abrasion and contusion lateral left thigh), left roof side rail (laceration to scalp), and lower instrument panel (laceration left knee)-MAIS- 1 . Case 3-UM-2389 1986 Mercury Cougar Car/Van CDC- 10-LYEW-3 This 1986 Mercury Cougar had stopped at a "stop" sign and as it moved into the intersection it was struck in the left side by a 1985 GMC Rally Van (Fig 5). Damage to the left door was fairly extensive with a maximum crush of 42 cm. The restrained 21 year old female driver (165 cm, 64 kg) sustained contusions of the abdomen, left and right hip (lap belt), contusions of the posterior head (side glass or other vehicle), and a contusion of the left arm (left door)-MAIS 1. Case 4- UM-2551 1987 Ford Escort Car/Car CDC 08-LPEW-4 On a snowy road a 1987 Ford Escort went out of control, slid into the left lane and was struck on the left side by the front of a 1978 Oldsmobile Cutlass (Fig. 6). Maximum left door crush was at least 31 cm. The estimated impact speed of the Cutlass was 36-48 kmph. The 17 year old male driver (183 cm, 105 kg), sustained a contused right hip from the automatic shoulder belt (the manual lap belt was not worn). At impact he contacted the left door (contusion left shoulder, lateral left chest and lateral left hip)-- MAIS-1 Notice that in the above AIS-1 cases there is significant driver door damage yet minimal injury(ies) to the driver. Other than preventing ejection from the car, the lap-shoulder belts do not afford the utmost protection in near-side impacts as these restraints do in frontal crashes. In far-side impacts the lap-shoulder belt system does offer significant protection. Figure 7 is but one example of this. Notice the significant right door damage yet minimal injuries to the lap-shoulder belted driver. Figure 7 AIS-2 Level Crashes Figures 8-12 illustrate crashes involving driver door impacts, damage which is not much more extensive than shown in the AIS-1 cars above, yet AIS-2 level injuries were sustained. 483</page><page sequence="4">Case 5- lJM-1414 1977 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser Stationwagon Car/Car CDC 09-LYEW-4 In this collision a 1977 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser stationwagon was struck in the left side by the front of a 1972 Pontiac Grand Prix. The maximum crush to the stationwagon was 74 cm at the left passenger compartment (Fig. 8). The 43 year old female driver (168 cm, 82 kg) was wearing the 3-point restraint, but with the shoulder belt behind her arm.

In addition she sustained small lacerations to the left forehead and face from broken glass-MAIS-2.(pelvis ) Case 6- UM- 1531 1978 Chevrolet Monte Carlo Car/Tree CDC 02-RYAW-3 A 1978 Monte Carlo on a slight curve ran off the right pavement, returned onto the roadway, crossed both lanes and ran off the opposite side of the road where it struck a tree. There was extensive damage to the right side with maximum crush of 41 cm at the right door area (Fig. 9). The 17 year old male driver (180 cm, 86 kg) was unrestrained and sustained only minor injuries-MAIS-1. The 17 year old female front right passenger (152 cm, 40 kg) was unrestrained. She was unconsciousness for 10 minutes (source unknown-but possibly the tree). She also sustained minor contusions about the knees, shins and right ear from contact with the right door and armrest-MAIS-2.(brain ) Case 7- UM- 1627 1979 Volkswagen Rabbit Car/Car CDC 08-LPEW-4 While attempting to turn left, a 1979 Volkswagen Rabbit was overtaken by a 1962 Ford Fairlane that struck the left side of the Rabbit, causing extensive damage to the left front door where the maximum crush was 42 cm (Fig. 10). Upon impact the unrestrained 28 year old male driver (180 cm, 68 kg) struck the left B-pillar (unconscious with contusions of the top left head, left cheek, and left shoulder), and the left door and armrest (contusion lateral left thigh)-MAIS-2.(brain) Ose 8-UM-1734 1979 Chevrolet Camaro Car/Tree CDC 08-LYAW-4 In a high speed police chase, a 1979 Chevrolet Camaro slide off the the roadway striking a fence and a large tree. Impact with the tree caused extensive damage to the left side where the maximum crush was 56 cm (Fig. 11). The driver, a 19 year old unrestrained male (178 cm, 86 kg) contacted the interior of the left door (contusion left chest); his feet were trapped by the floorpan and intruding lower left A-pillar (sprain of both ankles, laceration-left ankle and left forehead)--MAIS-2 (ankle). Case 9- UM-2387 1986 Plymouth Turismo Car/Car CDC 08-LYEW-4 This crash ocurred when a 1986 Plymouth Turismo attempted to make a U-turn. The front of a 1975 Chevrolet Monte Carlo hit the left side of the Turismo. Damage was fairly extensive with the maximum crush being 43 cm at the driver's door (Fig. 12). The driver, a 23 year old female (155 cm, 45 kg), was wearing the lap-shoulder belt. The most serious injuries noted were from contact with the left door and armrest (two fractures left pelvis, contusions of the left hip, left thigh and lateral left leg). In addition, she contacted the console (fracture right fibula, contusion lateral right leg)-MAIS-2. (pelvis/leg) Alg-3 Uyel Crashes Eleven crashes are described below. Notice that the car crush basically varies from minimal to extensive. Case 1 1 is a fatal crash, but for the far side occupant. Qe 10-UM-1776 1980 Plymouth Champ Car/Car CDC ll-LYEW-4 This 1980 Plymouth Champ was attempting a left turn. The front of a 1979 Chevrolet Malibu hit the left side of the Champ causing 44 cm of damage to the door (Fig. 13). The unrestrained 22 year old female driver (165 cm, 89 kg) sustained a vertical fracture of the left ilium into the acetabulum, and an abrasion of the left arm from contact with the left door intererior- MAIS-3. (pelvis) Case 11- UM-1787 1980 Mercury Capri Car/Tree CDC UM-03-RPAN-6 This is a fatal collision. A 1980 Mercury Capri went out of control, went off the roadway and struck a 20 cm diameter tree. There was extensive crush to the right side of the Capri (67 cm) and the front half of the vehicle had completely separated (Fig. 14). The unrestrained 14 year old female driver (154 cm, 52 kg) catapulted across the car to contact the tree and right door (subarachnoid, multiple intracerebral and brainstem hemorrhages, laceration right parietal scalp). She also sustained multiple abrasions about the body--MAIS-5. She was dead at the scene. The front right 15 year old unrestrained female passenger (57 cm, 57 kg) who was adjacent to the impact site, sustained a fracture of her right femur as the only serious injury-MAIS-3.

This 1982 Ford EXP stopped for a "stop" sign and then proceeded into the intersection where it was hit in the left side by a 1974 Plymouth Duster. There was fairly extensive damage to the left rear side of the EXP where the maximum crush was about 48 cm at, and behind the left B-pillar (Fig. 28). The 26 year old male driver (13 cm, 89 kg) was using the 3-point restraint. On impact he contacted the left roof side rail (brain stem herniation and hemorrhage, bilateral contusions in the temporal and right frontal lobes ), and the left door interior (ruptured liver and spleen, bilateral contusion lungs with hemathorax, contused heart, contusion omentum with hemoperitoneum, large contusion left buttock, flank and thigh). He also sustained numerous contusions and lacerations about the body-MAIS-5. (brain) Case 26-UM-2309 1983 Plymouth Turismo Car/Car CDC 09-LDAW-4 This is a fatal collision. A 1983 Plymouth Turismo ran a red light at an interestion striking the front of a 1979 Dodge Aspen with the right rear quarter panel causing the Turismo to be rotated clockwise. It then was hit in the left side by a 1977 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. There was extensive damage to the left side of the Turismo where the maximum crush to the door was 47 cm (Fig. 29). The 19 year old male driver (185 cm, 78 kg) was wearing the 3-point restraint. The most serious injury, from contact to the left roof side rail, was a small subarachnoid hematoma, 2-contusions left lateral parietal lobe and contusions to the left lung with bilateral hemothorax, hemorrhage epicardium, 15 cm horizontal laceration left hemidiaphragm, 2-7.5 cm lacerations left lobe liver, lacerated spleen, left retroperitoneal and pelvic hematomas from left door impact.. He also sustained fractures of the left humerus, ribs, pelvis and tibia (left door), and lacerations throughout the body- M AIS -5. (brain/abdomen) Conclusions: •Field crash investigations show a diversity of injury levels to near-side drivers with significant and with minimal occupant compartment (door) intrusion. 489</page><page sequence="10">•"Intrusion" of the door, as related to the AIS level, must be concerned with the body area involved and not the maximum AIS sustained by the driver. •Significant intrusion without "significant" injuries should not be viewed as an aberration but rather that such crashes are commonplace occurrances. •Whether intrusion per se is "bad, or good" cannot be assessed by analysis of mass data alone but the "hard" copy of the cases must be reviewed and analyzed. •The near side crash injuries and their injury reduction do not have an easily defined simple solution. •Door modifications may change the occupant kinematics allowing for unexpected and unpredicted, new causes of injuries not revealed by current crash injury data bases (i.e.) head injuries from contact the striking car or the struck pole, or cervical spine injuries not now frequently noted. •Suggested door structure modifications may reduce some injury severities, in some body areas, in some side impacts, but should not be considered to be the panacea-the ultimate solution-the Polio vaccine-to significantly reduce side impact injuries-the salvation of all drivers exposed to the near-side crash. •Although rib or pelvic fractures may be reducted in frequency by door modifications, the forces that now cause such fractures may be transmited to the internal organs and "cause" internal injuries which are not now seen because the impact energy is not dissipated in the bone fractures. Only time will tell- investigations of real world crashes. -NASS- Unrestrained Drivers in Side Impacts (90° Impact Direction) All 'Side' CDC All Vehicles N=3293 Passenger Cars All All 'Side' Impacts Others 1st or 2nd CDC N=488 N=2805 All 'Side' Impacts 1st CDC (any 2nd CDC) N=1180 Left.
