One of the six principal Chinese cultures from 5000 to 3000 B.C., Yangshao is divided into two branches: the nuclear Yangshao, located in Honan and Shaanxi Provinces, and the subsequent northwestern or Gansu Yangshao, located in Gansu and parts of Qinghai Provinces. Both branches are further subdivided into six eponymous phases: the Banpo (early fifth millennium) and Miaodigou (mid-fourth millennium) of the northeastern nuclear Yangshao; and the Shilingxia (mid-fourth millennium), Majiayao (late fourth millen nium), Banshan (early third millennium), and Machang (mid-third millennium) phases in the northwestern Gansu Yangshao.2 All six phases share similar architecture and stone implements and are charac terized by high-fired earthenwares that are painted in shades of black, red, and brown. However, the shapes and decorations of these ceramics vary from phase to phase. Earthenwares from the Gansu Yangshao phases are distinguished from those of earlier periods by the density and complexity of their decoration. Machang forms include large and small two-handled jars and pitchers, bowls, and beakers. The majority of the decorative motifs on the Machang painted wares are geometric and include curvilinear patterns and cross-hatching, as well as lozenges, triangles, circles, and squares, in an endless array of combinations. The most distinctive images from the Machang decorative vocabulary are the striking and mysterious figures that Clarence Shangraw has dubbed "tufted zoomorphs."3 Found on the upper half of the exteriors of hu jars and in interiors of deep bowls, tufted zoomorphs have central trunks from which extend bent limbs that frequently end in several digits. Clumps of tufting (or feathers) are found at the joints and along the trunks and limbs. Acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in I987, five Machang pieces illustrate the astonishing complexity and variety of the tufted zoomorph motif. These include a dou, or footed cup; a large, deep bowl with two handles and a spout; and three smaller bowls. With the excep tion of the dou, which is covered with bands of red and black paint, the exteriors of these bowls are sparsely decorated. The lips of three of the bowls have slight decoration of bands, triangles, and garlands; the exterior of the fourth bowl is unpainted. The tufted zoomorph in the interior of the large, spouted bowl has the most anthropomorphic appearance of all the Boston examples (fig. I ). Painted in red with a black outline, the limbs of this figure fill the bowl. They are depicted in opposition to one another, making this DENISE PATRY LEIDY is Research Assistant, Asiatic Department, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. 23</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston VOL.

In con trast, the limbs of the zoomorphs in the dou (fig. 2) and in one of the smaller bowls (fig. 3) are mirror images. The zoomorph in the dou is painted in red and black. Two sets of tufted limbs, with five digits each, fill the outer edges of the bowl. Additional tufting is found along the center of the main trunk. A sparsely painted red circle with two paw like images to either side surrounds the center of the torso. The black zoomorph in the smaller bowl has no tufts, but its two sets of limbs also end in five digits. The mirroring of the limbs of these zoomorphs is difficult to comprehend because the figures can be read either individually or as a pair. This enigmatic treatment is characteristic of tufted zoomorphs, which are represented in an endless number of variations in the art of Machang. Two distinctly shaped smaller bowls in the Boston collection provide additional variants of these images. A pair of crossed trunks, painted in red with black outlines, decorates the interior of a waisted bowl with two large handles (fig. 4). Six cowrie shells circle its upper lip. On the other hand, the zoomorph (or zoomorphs) in the last of the five Boston bowls (fig. s) is represented by four large triangles con taining two medium-size triangles and four smaller triangles, all of which end with five digits.

I, I989 these images as anthropomorphic, without speculating about their iconography.4 Western scholars continue to identify these images as either zoomorphic or anthropomorphic with the exception of Annaliese Bulling, who has linked the tufted zoomorphs with the cosmic tree and earth-to-heaven pillar imagery of later Chinese civilization.5 Dur ing the last thirty-five years, Chinese archaeologists have uncovered several spectacular sites that have provided a wealth of new material for the study of Machang society.6 In their discussion of this new material, Chinese scholars also read the tufted zoomorphs as anthropomorphic images. However, they often specify these images as amphibian or people-frogs and equate them with the frogs and related creatures that decorate the ceramics of earlier Yangshao phases such as Banpo and Majiayao.7 Parallels to the numerous later Chinese legends regarding frogs and toads are cited to confirm this identification of the tufted zoomorphs. Cemeteries at Yuanyangzhi in Yungchang, Gansu Province,8 and at Liuwan in Luodu, Qinghai Province,9 are among the more spectacular excavations of Gansu Yangshao sites in which tufted zoomorphs painted on ceramics have been uncovered. One hundred and fifty-one tombs from the Banshan and Machang phases were excavated at Yuanyangzhi. Of these, one hundred and thirty-one contained burial goods including stone and bone implements and ornaments, cowrie shells, and painted and unpainted ceramics.'I Two hundred and twenty eight of the three hundred and seventeen tombs from Liuwan date to the Machang phase.II As was true at Yuanyangzhi, the majority of these tombs also contained burial goods. Because of the similarity between these goods and objects of daily use, it is generally assumed that the Machang burial goods are the possessions of the deceased that were interred with them at death. One of the sixteen ceramics excavated from tomb I97 at Liuwan, and seven of the ninety-six vessels from tomb 5 64 at the same site are decorated with the tufted zoomorph motif.I2 As is true of the Boston pieces, the Liuwan ceramics were functional vessels used for storing and serving food. There is no indication that particular Machang ceramics were designated for ritual purposes or as burial goods. Nonetheless, the relative scarcity of the tufted zoomorph motif in the art of Machang and Banshan, and the noticeable rarity of anthropomor phic or zoomorphic images in the Yangshao civilization suggest that such unusual images may have had a specific iconography. Ichthyomorphic and avian images are found in the earlier ceramics of Banpo and Miaodigou, and scholars have generally assumed that the spirals and curvilinear designs of the later Yangshao wares are derived from this seminal representational imagery. '3 With a few exceptions, until the burgeoning of figural imagery during the Banshan and Machang phases, little anthropomorphic or zoomorphic imagery occurs 26</page><page sequence="6">L E I D Y: 7hfted Zoomorphs Fig. 6.

These include two small, well-known bowls from Banpo village in Shaanxi Province with masked faces painted in their interiors;'4 a Majiayao-style bowl with painted dancers, excavated in Datong in Qinghai Province in I 973; I5 and a Miaodigou-phase ping vessel, capped with a representation of a human head, excavated from Dadiwan in Gansu Province in 1980.16 Holding hands and wearing penis sheaths, the dancers on the Datong bowl are unique in the imag ery of Yangshao ceramics. They represent the only example of either a group of figures or an actual activity from this civilization. More impor tantly, these figures are the only known images that have not been altered or combined with zoomorphic or decorative pattems. All of the figures from Banshan and Machang, and their prototypes from earlier Yangshao phases, share two distinctive traits: the hy bridization of human and animal forms, and the masking, tattooing, or eliminating of the face. For example, one of the masked faces from Banpo, cited earlier,I7 has two fishes protruding from its ears. Further more, the Miaodigou ping from Dadiwan provides a prototype for several Banshan and Machang objects. A representation of a horned and tattooed head, collected at a Banshan site by Andersson, is believed to have once capped a small jar.'8 The back of this head is decorated with a small three-dimensional lizard, providing one of the earliest examples of human-headed lizards, a motif found in other neolithic sites and in the art of later periods. '9 Additionally, the Dadiwan ping is a prototype for the many beakers with three-dimensional human heads appliqued to the lower part of their sides, recently excavated from Machang sites.20 Tufted zoomorphs from Machang are generally headless, whereas those from Banshan have large circular heads which are filled with cross-hatchings and other designs. Excavated from Shancheng in Qing hai Province in I97i, a striking Machang vessel (fig. 6) with an ap pliqued three-dimensional head links vessels with similar decorations to the contemporary tufted zoomorph motif.21 The head, which is tattooed, is attached to the tufted limbs painted on the body of this ves sel, suggesting the anthropomorphic nature of the tufted zoomorphs. Decorated with a molded and incised hermaphrodite, a Machang piece (fig. 7) excavated in I974 at Liuwan, Qinghai Province, further illus trates the humanity of the tufted zoomorph.22 Here the facial features and sexual organs of the hermaphrodite have been combined with the painted limbs characteristic of the tufted zoomorphs. A skeleton painted in the interior of a Banshan-period bowl provides another, albeit macabre, dimension to the imagery of this period.23 The her maphroditic, skeletal, and related images in Machang art have been linked to the practice of shamanism.24 The scarcity of figural imagery in the Yangshao culture and the deliberate ambiguity characteristic of the representations of the tufted zoomorphs suggest that the latter may 27</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston VOL. I, I989 reflect religious beliefs or ritual practices prevalent in Machang and Banshan. Shamanism is an ecstatic religious system in which male or female practitioners, either by transforming themselves or by using animal powers, enter a trance state and travel throughout the cosmos in order to commune with gods and ancestors, heal the sick, and generally assist in human affairs.25 In the vestiges practiced today in parts of Siberia, inner Asia, and North and South America, the symbolic dis membering of an adherent's body and the wearing of robes adomed with either feathers or bones are important.26 Both rituals provide strong and fascinating parallels to the motif of the tufted zoomorphs. In particular, the feathered limbs of these images may be intended to represent the costumes wom by shamans; and the numerous varia tions in the depictions of these limbs could symbolize dismember ment. Certainly, the masking, tattooing, and eliminating of the face mentioned earlier reflect the common shamanistic practice of wearing masks. Early Chinese history, literature, and art abound with references to shamanism. For example, two Eastem Zhou (770-256 B.C.) classics, the Shanhai ling and the Chu Ci, contain references to earlier shaman istic beliefs.27 The imagery of the ritual bronze vessels of the Shang (1726-il22 B.C.) and Zhou (II22-256 B.C.) dynasties is primarily shamanistic.28 The winged and homed figures on the painted banners and coffins from the Mawangdui tombs attest to the continuation of shamanism in south China during the Han dynasty (2o6 B.C.-A.D. 220).29 Tufted zoomorphs are not found in the post-Machang cultures of northwestem China.30 The shapes and sparse decoration of the ce ramics of the Qijia phase that succeeded Machang in the late second and early first millennium B.C. are closer to those of the wares of the predominant Longshan culture, which spread westward from Shandong Province, than to earlier traditions. Nonetheless, despite the disappearance of tufted zoomorphs from the visual arts of northwestem China in the second and first millennia B.C., striking parallels are found in the art of the Shang dynasty of Bronze Age China. Several are molded into the sides of a covered jar in the Avery Brundage Collection in San Francisco (fig. 8).3' The squatting, masked figure that fills the side of a bronze drum in the Sumitomo Collection (fig. 9) also reflects the persistence of Yangshao imagery in later periods; his posture is identical to that of the tufted zoomorph in the large spouted bowl in Boston.32 Moreover, the Sumitomo figure provides a link between the shamanistic imagery of neolithic China and that of the Bronze Age. His masked face is related to the taotie images, the most ubiquitous motifs of the Shang vocabulary. Although the meaning of the taotie remains controversial, several scholars have Fig. 8.
