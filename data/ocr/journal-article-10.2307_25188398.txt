(The Arabist, Budapest Studies in Arabic, 21-22). pp. vii, 300. Budapest, Eotvos Lorand University Chair for Arabic Studies &amp; Csoma de Koros Society Section of Islamic Studies, 1999. DOI: 10.1017/S1356186303253463 The 3 5th International Congress of Asian and North African Studies (ICANAS) met in Budapest, from 1 to 7 July, 1997. The present volume represents the second part of the proceedings of the Congress' Arabic and Islamic sections. While the first part of the proceedings [see the review by Francois de Blois, JRAS (2000) 2, pp. 239?241] contains papers on linguistics, literature and history, the papers of the second part cover Islam, popular religion and culture, Islamic law and the histories of Arabic Studies and of Islamic Art. In accordance with the number of general subjects covered, the papers of the volume are divided into five sections. Section I, "Islam", counts nine papers. They deal with the origins of Islam and its relationship with Christianity and touch upon Sufism, linguistics, theology, philosophy and the question of the Muslim Diaspora. Pavel Pavlovitch (Sofia) writes about "Early Origins of the Term sirk: About an Equalitarian Conception during the Gahiliyya" (pp. 3?n). Dmitry Frolov (Moscow) goes into "The Notion of Stone in the Quran" (pp. 13-25). "A Hanbali Critique of Anthropomorphism" (pp. 27?36) is what Merlin Swartz (Boston) looks at. Tamas Ivanyi (Budapest) contributes an article "On the Notion of islah in Ibn Agiba's Sufi and Grammatical Commentary" (pp. 37-52). "Proof of the Existence of God: A Comparative of Study between Averroes and St Thomas Aquinas" (pp. 53?62) is how Ismail Mohamad (Bangi) has named his paper. Elena M. Savieheva (Moscow) examines "Muslim-Christian Relations in the Middle East" (pp. 63-66). Binyamin Abrahamov (Ramat-Gan) lists "Some Notes on Extremism and Moderation in Islamic Theology" (pp. 67-72). The paper by Muhammed Haron (Belville) is called "The Samarquand-Cape Town Connection: Revisiting a 10th Century Theological Text" (pp. 73-88). Suleman Dangor (Durban) gives an account of "African and Asian Muslims in the Diaspora in South Africa" (pp. 89-98). Section II on "Popular Religion and Culture" consists of seven papers. While most of the papers focus on magic and popular customs, one is dealing with the aesthetics of Egyptian folk art and another looks into a certain genre of literary sources depicting human life in medieval Islam. The section opens with "Women Stories in the Mamluk Age: Loves and Struggles to Survive" (pp. 101-110), by Francesca Maria Corrao (Naples). Mona Kamel Ahmed El-Eissawi (Cairo) talks about "al-Hasais al-gamaliyya fi l-bina? at-taskiH as-sabi al-misri" (pp. 111-123). Muhammad Ahmad Ghoneim (Mansoura) treats "as-Sihr wa-1-alaqat azzawgiyya fi 1-mugtamaat ar-rifiyya: dirasat anthrubulujiyya fi bad qara muhafazat addaqahliyya bi-misr" (pp. 125-134). Shawki Abd</page><page sequence="2">392 Reviews of Books El-Kawi Uthman Habib (Cairo) delineates "al-Ihtifalat ar-ramadaniyya fi wahat as-sahra al-garbiyya" (pp. 135-140). Sameeh Abd El-Ghaffar Shaalan (Cairo) explores "al-Mutaqadat wa-1-mumarasat as-sacbiyya al-murtabita bi-marad al-atfal wa-mawtihim" (pp. 141-151). "Al-Musalaha wa-1-qasr aw nahgan li-t-tacamul ma a 1-ahar al- gayr(awl): al-ittisal wa-t-tawil" (pp. 153-165) is the paper delivered by Saber El-Adly (Budapest). The paper of Alexander Fodor (Budapest) is dedicated to "Goldziher's Abu Ris" (pp. 167-190). There are only two papers in section III on "Islamic Law". While Agostino Cilardo (Naples) speaks "On Some Recent Laws on the Islamic Law of Inheritance" (pp. 193-204), it is "The Problem of Adoption Under Modern Islamic Legislation in the Arab States" (pp. 205-212) which attracts the interest of Hans-Georg Ebert (Leipzig). Under the heading "History of Arabic Studies", section IV contains six papers on the history of the discipline either through the lives of important scholars or in the light of the works of certain periods in certain countries. Jacques Waardenburg (Lausanne) examines "The Impact of Louis Massignon (1883?1962) on Islamic Studies" (pp. 215-228). Ludmilla Hanisch (Halle-Wittenberg) searches for "Ideals of Erudition and Tendencies of Education in German Islamic Studies during the First Half of the Twentieth Century" (pp. 229-238). Carsten-Michael Walbiner (Beirut) overviews "Christian Arabic Studies in Germany during the Last 150 Years: A Short Survey" (pp. 239-247). Y. Kochubey (Kiev) provides an introduction to "Arabic Culture and Arabic Studies in Ukraine" (pp. 249-254). Khairia Kasmieh (Riyadh) tells the biography of "Bandali Saliba al-Gawzi (1871-1942): A Russian Orientalist from Jerusalem" (pp. 255 262). N. M. Gorbunova (Moscow) outlines "The New Approaches to the Study of Oriental History Based on the Scholarly Heritage of Nicolai lvanov" (pp. 263?266). Section V is dedicated to the "History of Islamic Art". Its four chapters represent analytical descriptions of Islamic textiles and metalwork. The section begins with the life of Hungarian architect Max Herz who helped create the Cairo Arab Museum, which today is the Museum of Islamic Art. The paper on Herz by Istvan Ormos (Budapest) is titled "The Main Sources on the Life, Career and Activities of Max Herz Pasha (1856-1919)" (pp. 269-276). It is followed by Marianne Ellis (Oxford) who presents "The Newberry Collection of Islamic Embroideries in the Department of Eastern Art, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford" (pp. 277?286). P. R. Gamzatova (Moscow) reflects on "The Functions of the Prayer Rug in the Culture of Islam" (pp. 287?296). A. lvanov (St. Petersburg) closes both the section and the book with "Iranian Cauldrons of'Open Type'" (pp. 297-300). Obviously, the twenty-eight papers differ to a great degree in terms not only of their length but also with regard to their character. While some have to be regarded as miscellanies, others are reports of work in progress and a few may be even called monographic. In a collection such as this, different readers will naturally find different things interesting. Given the quantity of contributions on popular culture and art, people interested in these fields will certainly find their expectations met. It is in these sections where numerous tables either appear in the papers or are appended to them. Sometimes also Arabic documents relied upon in the texts, whether written in English or Arabic, are provided in the original. What makes the book worth looking at is the fact that one finds papers in it written by scholars from Eastern Europe and Africa who one does not normally come across so often in the usual forums of publication in the West. Printing mistakes are few and not serious, except for page 141, which is totally unreadable. This is regrettable as the page represents the front page of the paper by Sameeh Abd El-Ghaffar Shaalan on popular beliefs and exercises in relation to the disease and death of children.
