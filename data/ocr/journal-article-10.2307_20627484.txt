<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nursing Mothers in Greek and Roman Medicine JULIE LASKARIS Abstract Greek and Roman pharmacopias included a heavily symbolic and highly effective substance: human milk. In early Greek sources, human milk, sometimes specifically from "a woman who has borne a male child," is recom mended almost exclusively in treating women. The Greek use was adapted from an Egyptian ritual calling for the "milk of one who has borne a male child" to be poured from an anthropomorphic vase of Isis nursing Horus; the Egyptian application was not, however, gender specific. Similar vases were found in Greece in Geometric/Orien talizing contexts. These factors, together with evidence for Isis worship in Greece, suggest Greek knowledge of Egyptian ritual. Human milk therapies also appear in medical works arising in the Roman context, where they are not gender specific. Owing to Etruscan influence, Ro man society was less polarized sexually than Greek, and it was more accepting of the female body. The Etruscans' and Romans' rich tradition of depicting nursing mothers sharply contrasts with Greek chariness about the female breast. Thus, we see that medical ideas and practices, as they were transmitted cross-culturally, were affected vari ously by each culture's concepts of sexual gender.* Greek and Roman doctors employed some thera peutic substances that bore symbolic meaning in their respective cultures. Greek medical texts from the Clas sical period, for instance, call for the use of animal excrement, sulphur, asphalt, and other substances associated with ritual pollution and purification. Von Staden noticed that in the earliest of these texts?the gynecological treatises of the Hippocratic corpus?the most polluting of these substances, excrement, is used for the cathartic treatment of women only, which ac cords with the tendency in Greek culture to see women as inherently polluted.1 Women were considered to be especially polluting if they were menstruating or had recently undergone childbirth, miscarriage, or abor tion.2 Not even goddesses were excepted from this general scheme: their cult statues were ritually bathed more frequently than were those of male gods,3 and Theophrastus (Hist. pi. 5.9.8) tells us that expiatory sac rifices were made when the silver fir statue of Eileithyia "menstruated" (i.e., exuded resin). The gynecological texts also contain the only early references to the medical use of another symbolic sub stance: human milk.4 It, too, is recommended almost solely for women (the one exception is for infants). Sometimes the "milk of a woman who has borne a male child" (ydXa [yd?xxKTi] y^vaiKoq KoupoxpocpoD) is speci fied.5 I use the term "kourotrophic" when referring to such milk. Kourotrophos is a striking word to find in medical treatises, as it otherwise appears primarily in poetic texts and nearly exclusively with reference to goddesses or homelands.6 Though excrement and milk therapies are gender specific in the Hippocratic corpus, they are recom mended for both sexes in works that arose in Italy. The Etruscan and Italic peoples, less polarized sexu ally than the Greeks, were less fearful of the female body and did not associate it with pollution to the same degree.7 This greater ease with the female and the maternal can be seen in the rich Etruscan and Italic traditions depicting nursing mothers?a motif rarely found in Greek art, as Bonfante has shown.8 * The debt that this paper owes to Larissa Bonfante's work is great and will be obvious. The debt that I owe Bonfante herself is greater still and goes back to my undergraduate days at New York University, when I first fell under the spell of her spar kling humor and wide-ranging erudition. I had arrived with an interest solely in Greek philosophy, but I learned from Bon fante just how eloquently material culture, too, can articulate beliefs and values. She had us sailing over disciplinary divides long before it was the thing to do. But the example she set for us was not only as a scholar: "She has," as the late Bluma Trell remarked of her, "every virtue." Bonfante is living proof that the long view and the intellectual discipline required by our work can foster in us a more genuine respect for others and a straighter moral compass than might otherwise be the case. And so my debt to Bonfante is unpayable, as it is accumulating constantly. I will be forever?and happily?in the red. 1 von Staden 1992; cf. Carson 1990.

The phrase refers to Isis and her infant son, Horas.10 It is a fixed phrase, as is the one in the Greek medical texts, which may indicate a direct translation from Egyptian to Greek. Egyptian healers obtained "Isis' milk" by a transubstantiation ritual in which they poured human milk into and out of an anthropomorphic vase of Isis nursing Horas,11 while reciting a lengthy incantation about them.12 Despite the ritual emphasis on milk as nourishment, Egyptian prescriptions did not generally call for the transubstantiated milk to be drunk, even by infants, but recommend it for washes and ointments, often for treating burns; the exception is when it serves as a fertil ity test. In the Hippocratic corpus, kourotrophic milk is called for five times, primarily for vaginal pessaries; it, too, is to be drunk only for a fertility test. Similar are the 18 other milk recipes in the corpus that call for a woman's milk but do not specify that it be kou rotrophic: 15 are for vaginal pessaries, and one is for a cake intended to reveal a fetus' sex.13 Two are more similar to the Egyptian recipes in that they recommend the milk for an ear wash and for an eye ointment for infants. The proximity of the unqualified milk reci pes to the kourotrophic ones, and their resemblance to them or to the Egyptian recipes, suggests that they, too, were originally kourotrophic recipes.14 The medical uses to which the Egyptians and Greeks put human milk (to treat burns, eyes, ears, and geni tals) are the very ones for which modern medical stud ies have shown that its powerful immunological and antimicrobial properties?far greater than those of most mammals' milk?would be particularly effective.15 Modern research demonstrates that human milk inhib its Staphylococcus aureus, a frequent cause of neonatal eye and other infections (a subtype of Staphylococcus is a frequent cause of ear infections) .16 The colostrum is even more potent and has been shown to be about half as effective as the prescription antibiotic gentamicin in checking Staphylococcus and coliform organisms.17 Colostrum's effectiveness against Chlamydia trachoma tis is more impressive yet. Chlamydia causes a sexually transmitted disease, and subtypes of it cause trachoma, which is the leading infectious cause of blindness and serious visual impairment. Colostrum is so effective against it that one study suggests treating neonatal eye infections with it in the absence of conventional treat ments.18 In short, human milk was among the most po tent antibiotics in the ancient world; it is little wonder that it seemed divine. Archaeological evidence supports this contention concerning the influence of Egyptian medicine. It has been well established that from the Geometric/ Orientalizing period on, Greeks who were in frequent contact with Egypt readily adopted Egyptian deities or syncretized them with Greek gods.19 For instance, a bronze statuette with unknown provenance (possi bly Naucratis) bears an Ionian dedicatory inscription to Isis datable to the late sixth or early fifth century B.C.E.20 Of special relevance are four anthropomor phic vases, possibly of Greek manufacture and similar to the Egyptian ones of Isis nursing Horus. They were found at the Cretan cave sanctuary of the birth goddess Eileithyia Inatia, which is the site of the largest collec tion of Egyptian and Egyptianizing artifacts on Crete and includes representations of Egyptian deities.21 The presence of these vases suggests that the transub stantiation ritual was performed by Greeks or was at 9Dawsonl932. 10 London Medical Papyrus 20, 46 (Ebbell 1937); P Ebers 109, 111, 368, 384, 408, 414, 499, 500, 575, 763 (von Deines et al. 1958); P.

Between six and 13 figurines of Isis suckling Horus were also found at the Heraion on Samos,22 whose cult had close ties to the Heraion at Naucratis23 and where Hera worship can be traced from ca. 625 B.C.E.24 M?ller argues that Naucratis was the main channel in the Archaic period for many of the Egyptian items that reached Greece.25 Thus, Greek-Egyptian contact around the time of the Hippocratic gynecological texts was such that the Greeks could have learned the transubstantiation ritual. The oral tradition that likely shaped the gyne cological treatises probably included the practices of wet nurses and midwives, many of them foreign-born.26 Wet nurses would also generally have been the source of much of the therapeutic milk itself, for prosperous Greek women of the Classical period may not have nursed their babies very frequently.27 Such a path of transmission would account for the differences in the therapeutic ends to which the milk was put in the Egyp tian and Greek traditions, as the testimony of lowly for eign midwives and wet nurses regarding gynecological and pediatric matters would have been more credible to male Greek medical writers than would their views on other ailments. Such a path may also account for the poetic kou rotrophos, with its strong religious connotations. Kourotrophic goddesses are not, however, imagined as lactating. Those from the Classical period and the mainland, at any rate, cared for their kouroi in more abstract ways. No Greek cult epithet corresponds to the Latin nutrix, which denotes breast-feeding specifi cally; the Greek word that does refer specifically to a wet nurse (raGri) is never used of a goddess.28 These religious connotations reflect the ritual ori gins I suggest for the use of kourotrophic milk in Greek medicine. Isis, who nursed her son back to health and granted immortality to the pharaohs through her milk, was in the strict sense kourotrophic, but that representation could not survive in classical Greece for long, where chariness about the naked female breast and breast-feeding was so pronounced.29 As Bonfante remarks: female nudity, including the view of the naked female breast, was generally felt by the Greeks to be something to be avoided. The nursing image in particular was a sign of non-civilisation, characterising the animal na ture of such creatures as centaurs and barbarians.30 This same disquietude underlies the assertion in the Hippocratic treatise Deglandulis 16 (8.570-72 L)31 that milk is produced from uterine blood. Any blockage of the milk can cause grave problems, and the woman will suffer symptoms similar to those arising from blocked menstrual blood: one of the conditions that requires cathartic treatment with such substances as animal excrement. Others, too, associated milk with blood. Empedocles (fr. 59 [68] Wright) proposed that milk was putrified blood, relating, apparently, tiuov (colos trum) to 7ru6&lt;; (pus) ,32 Aristotle (Gen. an. 777a7), who preserves the fragment, strongly objects, as he views milk as fully concocted blood. Such notions are rationalizations of the fears regard ing the breast and breast milk?and women's physical nature in general?that are evident in classical Greek art and literature, and they explain the gender speci ficity of human milk therapies. The original ritual context for the "milk of one who has borne a male child" has been lost, as the Greeks of the Classical pe riod would not accept the verbal or visual image of a lactating goddess. Medical texts from Italy mention both excrement33 and human milk therapies, including milk from a woman who has borne a male child (now identified with the prosaic and mundane ccppevoxoKOc; and "quae marem enixa sit") .34 These remedies are markedly dif ferent from their predecessors, however, in that they 22Skon-Jedele 1995, figs. 1562,1563. 23Kron (1988,145) calls the Heraion in Naucratis the "Fili alheiligtum der samischen Hera in Aegypten." 24M?ller2000,101,188,214. 25 M?ller 2000,182-215. It is tempting, too, to associate the Isis vases with Early Minoan vessels in the shape of women that were found at Myrtos on Crete, particularly since in two cas es, the contents were to be poured out through holes in the breasts. With one exception, these vessels come from funer ary contexts. Dickinson (1994, 263-64) interprets them as li bation vessels similar to the zoomorphic ones discovered in tombs at Mesara and elsewhere, but given their functional em phasis on human breast milk, it is possible that the vessels had been used in treating the person while alive. 26Rousselle 1988; Riddle 1992; Demand 1994, 63-70,132; 1995, 283-87.

That an adult male would be willing to drink human milk in itself signals a profound differ ence from classical Greece. Galen even recommends suckling directly from the woman as the best way to get the milk.35 These changes appear in tandem with changed medical views of female physiology that arose with the higher status of women in Hellenistic and Roman so cieties.36 Women's bodies were then seen as analogous to men's, rather than as their opposites. While not all fears about the female body had vanished,37 women no longer seemed to be serious sources of pollution with special requirements for purification.38 The rise of the mystery cults, which promoted the belief that all people were tainted by the very fact of existence, may reflect a certain egalitarianism in this regard. A mystery cult of special relevance was that of Isis, whose diffusion into Greece and Italy was promul gated by Ptolemaic and imperial rulers. They found useful the central myth of the cult?in which Horus' accession to the celestial throne represented pharaonic accession on the divine plane. Images of Isis granting immortality to Horus?or to the pharaoh?by suckling him were ubiquitous in Egypt. Macedonian and Roman rulers found it worthwhile to keep this conception of the ruler and promoted a Hellenized form of the cult. Native Egyptians were the first members of the cult in Attica and Delos, where we have evidence for intense cultic activity. Intriguing is a classical Corinthian an thropomorphic lekythos of a female figure nursing a baby (possibly a nymph with Dionysos). According to Price, Isis may be a prototype for this and other fig ures;39 it certainly reminds us of the Archaic Isis vases discussed above that were found in Eileithyia's sanc tuary on Crete. Other artistic representations also reflect a greater ease with the female body: in the mid fourth century B.C.E., statues of nude goddesses came into vogue in Greece for the first time since the Geometric and Orientalizing periods.40 But Bonfante has noted that images of nursing mothers continued to be rare, and when they did appear, they were found in contexts that maintained the Greek association of the naked breast with imminent danger and supplication.41 By contrast, in the Etruscan and Italic traditions, female nudes appeared frequently from the Villanovan votive statuettes of the eighth century B.C.E. on.42 But it is in the conventions surrounding nursing mothers that Bonfante observes the sharpest contrast with Greece, as the image of human and divine nursing mothers is very popular in Etruria, south Italy, and Sicily?all regions where the cult of powerful fertility goddesses had remained strong.43 Included among these images are five depicting Uni's (EtruscanJuno's) ritual adop tion of the adult Hercle (Hercules) by nursing him; in one instance, Hercle is well muscled and bearded.44 That this image is acceptable in the Etruscan and Italic context aids our understanding of how Galen's surprising recommendation that a patient obtain therapeutic milk by suckling directly from the woman could be accepted. Medical ideas and practices, because they deal with the body, inevitably reflect, and are affected by, a cul ture's concepts of sexual gender. Because the Greeks of the Classical period were so wary of the female body, women alone were subjected to excrement therapies; by the same token, however, men were denied the benefits of that potent antibiotic, human milk. The Etruscan and Italic peoples, by contrast, had fewer fears about the female body and actually celebrated the maternal role?an attitude revealed in their art and literature and in the medical theories and prac tices that arose in Italy.
