<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 150 ) SOME ASPECTS OF THE AWEMBA RELIGION AND SUPERSTITIOUS O I3SERVANCES. By J. H. WEST SHEANE, B.A., J.P., F.R.G.S., Native Commissioner. INTRODUCTION. THE origin and government of the Awemba tribe, predominant till 1898 over the Amambwe, the Wabisa, the Walungu, and the other inhabitants of the vast stretch of country which lies between Lake Tanganika and Lake Bangweolo, anid is bounded on the east by the Loangwa and on the west by the Lipoposhi, has been already fully dealt with in the reports of Mr. Codrington, the Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia (B.S.A. Company's Annual Report, 1898-1900, pp. 66-67). A treatise on their languiage, compiled by J. Dupont, Vicar Apostolique of the French Mission of the Algerian Fathers, was published in 1900 and subsequiently Mr. Govan Robertson published his C(hi Wemba Handbook in 1904. Up to the present date, however, no special article has been devoted to the Awemba religion, as exemplified in the superstitions and ceremonies, which surround the principal events of the native life from the cradle to the grave. The whole subject is very complex and difficult to investigate, since the old men who practised the ritual and observances under Kitimlkului, and the dreaded Mwamba, are very loth to disclose their rites, fearing the vengeance of the spirits for divulging mysteries, to them most sacred. The younger generation, freed from the reign of terror wielded by the royal house and the priesthood, have gladly abandoned and forgotten the humani sacrifices and other sinister cults imposed upon them by their chiefs. Hence the present paper cani only pretend to deal with certain phases and aspects of the Awemba religion, since the esoteric rites, such as those said to have existed at Mwaruli, have never been divulged. Indeed the " survivals" to be found in the ordinary events of native life are becoming fainter and fainter every day, and withouit the help of Father Guilleine of the French Mission at Kilubula, and conversations with Kanyanta, the son of the late King Mwamba, even the followilng paper could not have been written. As with all Bantu faiths, so with the Awemba religion, ancestor worship is the mainspring of their theogony. However, they acknowledge a Supreme Being Leza,' who is above the tutelary spirits of the land (the Milungu and the Mipashi). He is the Judge of the dead, and condemns thieves, adulterers and I Derivations.-1. Le, to nourish-teste, Dr. Scott's Mang'anja Dictionary, p. 278. 2. Ez, to know- but we had better follow Torrend (Comp. Grammar, ? 365-6), who assigns no definite root.</page><page sequence="2">J. H. WEST SHEANE.-Some Aspects of the Awemba Religion. 151 murderers to the state of Vibanda, or Viwa (evil spirits), exalting the good to the rank of mipashi, or benevolent spirits. There is no special worship of Leza, for he is to be approached only by appeasing the inferior spirits, who act as intercessors. But in blessing, the parent beseeches Leza to protect his child, at the same time anointing the forehead of the infant with a drop of spittle (chipalamate) to show (they say) that the wish comes from his inmost feelings. Again, in cursing, the inijured man prays that Leza will send a lion to devour the evildoer. Leza is not anthropomorphic, like the Greek Zeus: though the chiefs are called Wana Leza, the Children of God; this is merely a compliment (cp. Torrend, Comp. Grammar, App. I (v).) NOTE.-This must not be confounded, as in Dupont's Grammar, with the expression Kana Besa, referring to an old time chief. THE MILUNGU. After Leza come the Milungu, or local guardian spirits. Torrend says that the word is foreign, and derives it from the Phenician Molocha (Torrend, Comrn. Grammar, ? 339), but Dr. Scott, Mang'anja Dictiontary sub. verb, says the root is to be found in KICzungusa, to perplex, cp. mzungu. It imeans the " Gods." But the Awemba do not clearly identify their milungu with the spirits of their ancestors, which they term mipashi. From the fact that the milungu are mainly entreated to send rain, and to fertilise the crops, that they reside in the hills, mountains and rivers, and not like the mipashi (ancestor spirits) in thickets near a village, it miaht be argued that they are primeval nature spirits, worshipped by the aborigines before the advent of the Awemba. Thus Mwamba used to sacrifice to Milungu, who were certainly not the spirits of his ancestors, sending oxen to appease deities as far afield as Musonde, a" mulunqu " living on the Kalungwisi, and as alien as the milungu of the Wabisa. THE MULENGA. This argument is strengthened by comparison of the worship of another nature spirit, the Mulenga, the god of the Rinderpest. Tradition holds that he cornies at stlated periods to wreak vengeance on the chiefs who have not worshipped himi by slaying their cattle. Any albino children who are born are said to be the daughters of the Mulenga, and the women of the country he devastated. However, unfortunately, this view, that the Awemba worship nature spirits, is a heresy against the accepted doctrine that the Tonga and other Bantu tribes akin to the Awemba, have no truly nature spirits, but appeal in all things, for rain, etc., to the spirits of their ancestors. Hence it seems safer to conjecture that the milungu are the mipashi of very ancient chiefs, exalted to the state of milungu " Gods " by the inatives, to whom their names, shrouded in the mists of antiquity,</page><page sequence="3">152 J. H. WEST SHEANE.-SOMe Aspects of the had become as inythical and meaningless as the prehistoric Dorus and lonus were even to the ancient Greeks. THE MIPASHI ANCESTOR SPIRITS. Following the milungu are the mipa.shi, the spirits of the dead ancestors, which may be divided into two classes, the spirit of the chief who is worshipped by all his subjects, and the spirit of the head of each family, who may be compared with the Roman Lar Familaris, since he is worshipped inside the hut, at the hearth (pa kyonto). In most cases the mipashi of chiefs inhabit the thicket where their bodies were laid to rest (cp. at Mwaruli, the Awemba kings' burying place), and in rare instances haunt the spot, reincarinated in pythons, as anmong the Wabisa at Nsombo on Lake Bangweolo at the present date. But the mipashi are not hill and mountain spirits like the milungu and worship is paid to them at their burying ground (chitengerwa). The only way in which a mupashi can conmmunicate anid warn his worshippers, is in dreams, or by meeting somne person, inspiring him, and making him rave. Sometimes they becomle permanently reincarnated in the bodies of the imfumu shya mii.pashi, possessed women. REINCARNATIONS-THE POSSESSED WOMEN. These women assert that they are possessed by the spirit of some dead chief, and when they feel the " divine afflatus," whiten their faces to attract attention, and anoint themselves with flour which has a religious and sanctifying potency. One of their number beats a drunm, and the others dance, at the same time singing a weird song, with curious intervals. Finally when they have arrived at the requisite pitch of religious exaltation the possessed fall to the ground, and burst forth into a low and almost inarticulate chant, which has a most uncanny effect. All at once are silent and the Basing'anga (medicine men) gather round to initerpret the voice of the spirit. Many men were denouniced as Walozi (sorcerers) by these possessed women, and the accused, unless protected by the King, were instantly killed or mutilated. These imfumnqu shya mijpashi are held in great veneration by the Awemba, and hunters ask them where game and elephants are to be found. They demand food and beer as their due from the villagers, asking it in the iname of the chief they represent, and curiously enough using archaic forms of speech, when asking for tobacco and beer. When a mupashi appears to a man in a dream without any special warning, it is. a sign that he has been neglected, and the Lupupo (burial sacrifices) held in his honour must be renewed. If the dreamer neglects the warning, he is sure to fall ill and then the medicine man has to be called in to appease the wrath of the spirit.</page><page sequence="4">AwevTha Religion and Superstitious Observances, 153 DUALISM-THE VIBANDA. Here first, in the spirit world (for Leza has no opposing Ahriman), we notice dualistic tendencies appearing, and we find that the mipashi are thwarted in their benevolent acts by the vibanda (the evil spirits). Among the Mang'anga, the Chiwanda, or Chiwa, is the " m6rder gheist" of the slain in battle, who drives the slayers to madness, unless they dance off the guilt, but among the Awemba they are evil spirits who roam about the earth, wreaking vengeance on all those who do not worship them or emulate their ill deeds. There are many stories of metn meeting a Chiwanda on the way, and beino enticed into a thicket, murdered and eaten by the same evil spirit, who reverts to the ghoulish banquets, which he enjoyed during his earthly life as a waloshi. All crimrnes committed by an individual are accounted for by his stating that he was temporarily possessed by a chiwanda. Only the waloshi (sorcerers) worship the chiwanda, anld in fact there seems to be no demon or fetish worship of evil spirits, as practised on the West Coast of Africa. Indeed, with the exception of the image of God at Mwaruli, which is said to have existed on good authority (Geoqraphical Journal, " Journey on the Tanganyika Plateau," by Charles McKinnon, Esq.) tended by the priestesses, who were called the wives of the God (mnRuk' a mwenyi) sculptured images of wood or stone are unknown amongst the Awemba, or at least very rare, as the above instance is the only one on record.' IMAGES. The small tulubi or idols, which are made by the Wabisa, and are sometimes found in Awemba huts, have no more religious worship paid to them than among the Awaiwa where the little girls use them as dolls. They are small images of womeln, carved with an Egyptian angularity of outline. It is interesting however to note that these dolls are buried with any young girl who dies prematurely, perhaps from the fear that they may be possessed by the spirit of the departed. CHARMS. The ordinary fetishes or charms, are made from the horns of small antelopes into which the medicine man has placed muti medicine, as a remedy against thirst, wild beasts, famine, and above all against the sinister arts of the sorcerer. THE LILAMFIA. The best known fetish is the Lilamfia, the gruesome use of which as a divining horn in the tilme of war is well known, but will bear repetition. When Mwamnba and his warriors went on a foray, they seized the first man they met on the way, On this point, however, Mr. Robert YouIng, Native Commissioner, writes later that he found no image at Mwaruli burial ground, but that Weni Mwaruli, the village chief, supposed to be the attendant of the departed chiefs, when lhe has a dream about them, takes beer to their graves and fills their old pipes with tobacco.</page><page sequence="5">154 J. H. WEST SHEANE.-Some Aspects of the and cut his throat. As the blood spurted out they placed the Lilamfia, affixed to a pivot, in the stream. The horn naturally spun round, and when it stopped they noted where the tip pointed, and made a raid in that direction. NOTE.-I hope at a later date to give fuller details as regards the use of the Lilamfia. AMULETS. Among amulets, the generic name of which is mpimpi, the following are the most noteworthy. The mapingo, composed of two tiny horns of duyker, worn by women, in the hope that they may bear children, since the reproach of ng'umba, or the barren woman, is the worst insult to an Awemba woman. The nsakirwa necklaces composed of little balls of wood inside which are miti medicines, mixed with oil, are supposed to avert the perils connected with pregnancy and delivery. These amulets are made by the mung'anga or doctor. TOTEMS. With the amulets, and closing the description of the Awemba objects of veneration, come the totems. When questionied as to the origin of their totems, an old chief will say that they were chosen by the various leaders long ago as symbolical of their virtues or vices. Thus Mwemba is a Wenan?q'andu&amp;, " Son of the Crocodile," because he and his ancestors seized and evilly entreated men even as the crocodile. Other chiefs bad for their totem a hoe (mnkoa); Matipa the King of the Wabisa was the Wenangona, " the son of a mushroom," and these totems descended on the distaff side alone. Thus Kanyanta, who was the son of Mwamba by a woman not of royal blood, was the son of the hoe. But no special worship is paid to the crocodile, though the natives believe that the souls of the drowned migrate into the bodies of crocodiles. Thuis at the river Luena, the natives assert that the large crocodile, which occasionally tries to seize the women going to draw water there, is a bad man, and that they can hear him at night crying in torment, " Give me porridge and give me beer. I am shivering with the cold." THE AWEMBA HIERARCHY. We rnust now return to the interpreters of the will of the divinities, but it must be noticed that any man coiuld pray to a mulungu or to a mnupashi, but when he offered sacrifices he generally consulted a priest. I. THE KING. The king seemis to have generally acted as intermediary between his people and the mnulungu, and to have sent sacrifices and to have prayed to the spirit of his father on their behalf, though he left the management of the ritual to the priests (the basing'anga) who seem to have formied the regular priesthood. Thus a chief never presided at the lupupo (burial sacrifices to his ancestor), but entrusted its performance to the singanya, or priest.</page><page sequence="6">Awembas Religion and Superstitious Observances. 155 II. THE M'GANGA. These priests were the learned class, the "leeches" and wise men of the people. Their main function was to interpret the will of the milungu and the mipashi, and to combat the evil enichantments of the sorcerers. They named children at birth, superintended the sacrifices, tended the sick, and charmed away diseases by divination and their amulets. But their office was in no sellse hereditary, and in fact most of the old people pretended to be basing'anga, in virtue of their position as the oldest members of their family. THE WALOSHI. Opposed to the wany'anga ,were the mlozi, tlie wizards and sorcerers, who comipassed the death of all who resisted them by means of their black arts and powerful medicines, imparted to them by some chiwanda, by whom in some cases they are possessed. Like ghouls the waloshi are said to dig up, mutilate and finally eat the dead bodies of their enemiies. By the power of the demoniiac influence conceded to them by the chiwanda, they can change themselves into lions or other wild beasts, hunting like were-wolves at night. and afterwards devouring their prey with their fellow-sorcerers. INSTANCES OF SUPERSTITIOUS OBSERVANCES. To realise how native custom and religion are inter-related, we have only to examine the ceremonies which take place at "the principal events of natives' existence, and, indeed, the fear of the wrath of the mipashi loonis large even in the most minute details of the village social life. Birth.-After a child is born, it is washed and placed before the fire wrapped in a goat-skin, salt is put on its tongue to make it take to the breast, and the midwife shows it to the sing'anga, who at once goes out and consults the lots, apanda misashi. When he has finished throwing down the bones he comes in and gives the child the name of some dead chief, declaring that the spirit will look after his namesake. Initiation.-When a girl reaches a marriageable age she is initiated at a dance called the chisungu, which corresponds to the unyago of the Yaos without the conicomitant immoral practices. But the girls are not isolated for a month in huts built in the bush, as among the Yaos, since the ceremonies take place inside a hut in the village, and last several mronths. Inside this hut dancing is kept up, an(d the girls are instructed in the elementary facts of life. Only womeni are allowed to be present, but on analysing seven chants used at this ceremony, and written down by a native at the dictation of his wife, they prove to be mainly in praise of the midwives of the olden times, and exhortatiorns</page><page sequence="7">156 J. H. WEST SHEANE.-Some Aspects of the to the girls to obey their husbands in all things inside the hut;. I have a copy of one lengthy Aweinba " epithalamium "-.- "The husband is powerful within the hut, We, the women, are merely as the chaff which hangs from the roof." Old saws are quoted exhorting the girl to nmodesty and to dress with decency. Divination.-The sing'acnga takes no part in the mrarriage ceremony, but, two months after a child has been born, he comes to the husband and tells him that now the propitious time has comne for him to resume cohabitation with his wife, or else the child will die. The husband obeys the doctor, and if the child dies subsequently the husband blames his wife, and says that the child has died because she has committed adultery. If she denies this they resort to the hunting test. The lhusband goes out and fixes nets for game. If the game caught is a female it is the woman's fault, but if it is a male the husband is to blame. In case of serious illness the sing'anga is requisitioned to find out the source of the bewitchment, and the mipashi or vibanda who have caused the malady. When a mian is really ill he sends for the sing'anga, who brings with him paraphernalia of small bonies of gazelles and the bones of birds. These he gathers together and sorts out on the ground, as if dealing a hand at cards. If this method is unsuccessful he has recourse to the tortoise test. A tortoise-shell, within which some very potent medicine has been inserted, is placed floating on the top of some water in a jar. Then the sing'anga, sprinkles a little flour on top and says: "0 tortoise, if the patient is destinied to recover, remain still, but if not, sink below." On discovery that the patient will live, he then repeats over the names of the mipashi who may have caused the illness through beinlg neglected. In case the avenging mupashi is the spirit of the man's father, the patient's wives are told to make beer and place it over the grave of the latter. A pot full of beer is placed at the head of the patient at night, anid if in the imiorning it has frothed over it is a good sign, as then the mvpashi, beinc a spirit of the under-world, has drunk the beer and is appeased. The Or deal.-In case a man is accused of theft, witchcraft, or murder, recourse is made to the usual mwavi test, or ordeal, an appeal to Leza to decide. Among the A wemba the accused is made to drink a decoction made fromi the bark of a tree of that namne, though amnong the Wabisa the boiling water test is the columonest. The trial is conducted in the presence of the chief, who prepared the mwavi himself, though in some cases it is prepared and handed to the accused by a little child, as the Awemba have the idea that the mwvavi, if coming, from innocent hands, will be more potenit. The same superstitiotn may, perhaps, be traced in the custom of carrying round a little child to plant bananas. If he vomits the poison the accused is declared ininiocent, and his accusers have to pay him a large indemiinity. However, if he fails to vomit, unless an antidote is at once administered the man dies with all the signs of violent poisoning. Then the body is burnt, and every vestige of the man destroyed from fear that he may turn into an evil spirit (chiwanda) and</page><page sequence="8">Awemba Religion and Superstitions Observances. 157 thus avenge himself. If the accused is an important man or a chief the mwavi is given to a dog or a cock, which is taken to represent the accused. If the cock dies the man is considered guilty and has to pay a heavy fine to the injured or bewitched parties, but in cases of theft his ears are often cut off. FUNERAL CEREMONIES. The funeral ceremonies of the Awemba are most impressive. As soon as a king, as the late Mwamba, had breathed his last, two of his wives were instantly sacrificed. Theni the body was laid in state inside his principal hut, which was lavishly decorated with calico, beads and tusks of ivory. The house was closed, and no one was allowed access to it, unitil his successor was appointed, who alone could give permiiission for his predecessor's burial. Oln the burial day, when the body of the chief, now reduced to a skeleton, was laid to rest wrapped in a bull's hide, all his servants, councillors, and his wives were paraded before the tomb, and smitten between the eyes with a club. They were then left for dead at the tomb, anid if by chance anyone managed to survive, he was not seized again, as the Basing'anga who preside at these functions say that he is not acceptable to the dead chief's spirit. Thus there is a man working at the Mission at Kilubula to day wlho was left for dead on the tormb of the former Kitimkulu. When a Wabisa chief died, instead of sacrificing all his attendants as the Awenmba did, his people only killed his head wife (rnmkolo), and this too when the chief had lain for a long time in state, and only hiis bones were left. Her body was split in twain, anid the bones of the chief were put inside, and buried in this ghastly winding sheet. Two moniths after the death of the chief, Lutpupo is held. They mourn while the beer is being made, and then have a great dance, and drink beer in honour of the defunct. The Basing'anga preside at the libations and sacrifices, which are offered by the suiecessor to his ancestor's mupashi. The burial of one of the common people is accomplished in this wise. The relations roll him up in a mat so that his knees touch his chin, and then carry him to the grave. On the way to the tomb some flour is sprinkled over the body of the deceased, to show-the natives say-that his friends are thinking of him. The head is turned facing the east. At burial, the nearest relation is let down into the grave, and cuts a hole in the blanket over the ear of the deceased that "he may hear when God calls him." Immediately afterwards the friends stand by, and one makes a small speech over the grave, saying that they will take care of his wife and survivinig children, and express the hope that he will become a good spirit in the next world. With the corpse are buried some food and calico, and his pipe. If a fundi, iron or ivory worker, his implements are broken over the tomb. If the head of a family, his relations generally hold a lupupo on a smiall scale. To go into mourning, a man binds a band, mnade from the bark of a tree, round his temples, for an infant for four days, for a grown up boy two months, and for his father at least three months. When a husband loses his wife he takes no active part in the mourning, but the relations, especially the mother</page><page sequence="9">158 J. H. WEST SHEANE.-SOrne Aspects of the Awemba Religion. of the deceased, lament. But when the husband dies it is the wife's duty to mourn him with a wailin-g dirge for at least a fortnight;-" Thou hast cast me away, 0 my husband, I shall never see thy like again." From the preceding glimpses of the ceremonies and procedure in the various events and stages of native life from childhood to burial, the influence of religion, and the superstitious dread of offending the spirits, is strikingly exemplified. The Awemba and other tribes on the Tanganika Plateau afford a rich field for the anthropologist, and it is to be hoped that some skilled observer may be setnt out to rescue the records of these primitive faiths and superstitions, before they are totally submerged by the relentless waves of an absorbing and materialistic civilisation.</page></plain_text>
