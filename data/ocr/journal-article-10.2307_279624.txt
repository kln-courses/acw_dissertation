Money shortages in the United States and a growing emphasis on domestic rather than foreign work have contributed to this situation. The general outlook, at least for groups from the U.S., is thus less bright. Some projects have been maintained by leaving skeleton crews in the field, while others have been held up. A few are still working at their normal rate, at least for 1974: David Grove's (University of Illinois-Urbana) Chalcatzingo project, where a number of new reliefs have been uncovered; Stuart Scott's (SUNY, Buffalo) Marismas Nacionales; Kent Flannery's (University of Michigan) Oaxaca Valley project; and the work of the New World Archaeological Foundation in Chiapas under Gareth Lowe. Some projects active in previous years have begun to publish their results. The most important is, of course, the first two installments of Rene Millon's (University of Rochester) Teotihuacan map; others are Sisson's Coxcatlan project report and Parsons' Valley of Mexico paper. As a result of the declining influence of North American archaeologists, Mexican and other groups have now taken over a larger share of Mesoamerican field research. The Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, having completed its reorganization, has now begun active work on several sites. Additionally, the new work is chiefly being conducted by a new generation of Mexican archaeologists, while the older and better known archaeologists are now being employed in routine restoration and exploration in the larger zones. Some of the work now being undertaken includes Norberto Gonzalez Crespo's crews in several sites in Yucatan and Quintana Roo, mainly Coba, necessitated by the tourist development of the Carib- bean coast, and Roberto Garcia Moll's work in Yaxchilan. These, together with the continuation of Eduardo Matos' project at Tula and others, signal the movement of younger, Escuela-trained personnel into large-scale work. Their excavations are characterized by good field techniques and a bent toward method- ology. The older generation is, however, still very active, as witnessed by the continued work at sites such as Tenango, where Pifia Chan has just published his second field report. As noted above, non-Mexican groups have also been quite active. The best example of this is the German Forschungsgeselschaft's Puebla-Tlaxcala project, headed by Angel Garcia Cook and Peter Schmidt. They have not only continued their explora- tions of this vital region but have published a number of Comunicaciones. The French mission is continuing work at Tonini and vicinity and has recently publish- ed a book by Baudez on his work at Naranjo, Honduras. In a year when fieldwork has not been very active, it was perhaps inevitable that meetings and congresses would be abundant. One of the most important was the First Palenque Round Table, organized by Merle Greene Robertson (Robert Louis Stevenson School, Pebble Beach), who has already announced the pub- lication of the papers. This was followed by the non-Mesoamerican meeting held in Hermosillo on 238</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH relationships between the U.S. Southwest and the Mexican Northwest, and subsequently by the 41st Congress of Americanists and the American Associa- tion of Anthropologists, both held in Mexico City. A very germaine meeting was held in Mexico City in July on restoration under the joint sponsorship of the INAH, the university, and the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologia. Resolutions were carried directing that consolidation be mandatory when working in built-up areas, restraining reconstruction projects to the minimum, and forming an INAH consulting com- mittee to advise projects that have such problems. Further information can be obtained from the Departamento de Prehispanicos, INAH. GUATEMALA. The final two seasons, 1973 and 1974, at Yaxha, El Peten, saw the completion of the mapping initiated in 1970. The site's Mayan emblem glyph was identified by John Justeson (Stanford University). He recorded the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the few still-preserved carvings of the more than 40 stone monuments. Nicholas Hellmuth, project director, with the aid of student assistants, mapped Nakum in 1973 and the late Post Classic ruins of Topoxte Island in 1974. Ten percent of this work was financed by the National Science Foundation and the remainder by the Foundation for Latin American Anthropological Research. Jay Johnson (Southern Illinois University) mapped Paxte and Cante Islands adjacent to Topoxte in Lake Yaxha. Columned halls and other architectural features comparable to twelfth to fourteenth century Yucatec sites were mapped in detail. More than 470 structures were drawn. Frank Ducote (California Institute of Technology) prepared isometric and perspective reconstruction drawings of more than 150 of the 500 structures at Yaxha and did a complete perspective drawing of the Main Palace Acropolis at Nakum. Fieldwork is now concluded; publication of accumulated data will begin in 1977. Prior to that date, all field data are freely available for consultation, in person, at the Foundation for Latin American Anthropological Research's office in Guate- mala City, 4 Av. 8-72, Zone 1. JAIME LITVAK KING CENTRAL AMERICA NICARAGUA. During the last few years, Lic. Jorge Espinosa Estrada (Depto. de Antropologia e Historia, Instituto Geografico Nacional) has been surveying and testing sites in the area of Monkey Point, in the Dept. of Zelaya. His excavations of a shell-midden called Nzei (or Angi) on the Monkey Bay coast has yielded abundant preceramic materials, including edge-ground cobbles, celt-like wedges (?), and a variety of scrapers, associated with hearths and abundant marine faunal remains. No radiocarbon determinations are yet available, but cross-datings with preceramic deposits in Panama suggest an age over 5,000 years. Financed by the Banco Central de Nicaragua, Richard W. Magnus (Yale University) is carrying out a four-year project on the Central and East coast. The main ecological problem under study is the seasonal alternation between dry inland occupations and coastal maritime settlements. In the areas of Zelaya, eastern Boaco, and eastern Chontales, Magnus has located a large number of sites. Many of these have been testdd in an effort to define the geographic limits of currently known Caribbean coastal complexes from Nicaragua. Within this study-area, Magnus plans to make large excavations at selected sites aimed at the recovery of floral and faunal evidence indicating seasonality of site-use and other related ecological problems. COSTA RICA. Carlos H. Aguilar (Universidad de Costa Rica) reports on work in the Area Central at the sites of Aurora and El Molino. Both sites have yielded materials dating from the Pavas phase (300 B.C. to A.D. 300). The ceramics from this incised tradition are being studied at the Laboratorio de Arqueologia of the Universidad. In the Province of Alajuela, in the western sector of the Central Highlands, Aguilar and his students have been excavating a site called Chapar- ral, which has yielded materials that may be transition- al between the Curridabat phase (A.D. 300-800) and the Cartago phase (A.D. 800-1500). The main Chapar- ral site occupation belongs to the most recent of these two phases and is characterized by circular mounds and stone causeways. Other sites of the Cartago phase in the same area, namely Barranca and Tejar, are being studied by Francisco Villalta (Centro Regional Univer- sitario de San Ram6n) and Lucy Rawson. The Barranca site shares many features with the Guayabo de Turrialba site previously excavated by Aguilar. Stratigraphic excavations in the Linea Vieja sub- region of the Caribbean watershed of Costa Rica by Michael J. Snarskis (Columbia University) have reveal- ed a ceramic sequence spanning the period from the beginning of the Christian era to the time of Conquest. The earliest and most homogeneous ceramic complex, designated El Bosque, consists of bichrome pottery, with pigments applied zonally and with considerable plastic decoration (Red Lip Ware). The El Bosque complex shares many stylistic traits with the Zoned Bichrome ceramics of northwest Costa Rica, the Aguas Buenas complex of southeast Costa Rica, the Volcan Baru (Cerro Punta and Barriles) complex of Panama and the recently defined Pavas complex in the Central Highlands. Remarkable similarities are also apparent between El Bosque ceramics and those from Momil in northern Colombia. A charcoal sample associated with El Bosque midden deposits has a date of 2295?165 radiocarbon years: A.D. 345 (1-7514). Later ceramic coimplexes in the Linea Vieja region include trade sherds of Mora and Birmania polychromes from Nicoya and Guanacaste. PANAMA. Between February and May 1974, Junius Bird (American Museum of Natural History) and Richard Cooke (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) excavated a large shelter called Cueva de los Ladrones, on the southern slopes of Cerro Guacamayo in Cocle Province. This site was the fourth to be excavated in a program designed to locate Paleo-Indian living deposits in Panama (the others were Lake Madden, Caves 1 and 2 and Cueva Bustamante, Maje). The Cueva de los Ladrones had four major occupa- tions. The Preceramic or oldest occupation (before 2000 B.C.) contained a number of bipolar, elongated but small flakes and spalls of banded agate which the excavators have tentatively suggested may be as- sociated with manioc preparation. This occupation 239</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lacks many of the specialized tool types found by Ranere in the Rfo Chiriqui shelters, but has abundant lithic materials now undergoing detailed examination. The succeeding Early Ceramic occupation (about 2000-200 B.C.) had a small sample of 2,600 sherds which, though poorly preserved, can be securely assigned to the Monagrillo and Sarigua complexes of Parita Bay. Despite careful use of sifters and flotation, samples of organic materials were disappointing. The excavators assume that the major occupation of the Cueva de los Ladrones (about 3000-200 B.C.) repre- sents either seasonal exploitation of local wild plant resources, or incipient vegeculture, or both. About 200 B.C. the site was abandoned, to judge from the lack of bichrome and polychrome pottery and diag- nostic lithic instruments. The last two occupations of the cave are late and belong to Phase VII (A.D. 1200-1520) of the Central Provinces sequence estab- lished by Cooke and to the Recent epoch (about A.D. 1800-to present). A deep shaft excavated by Bird and Cooke in April of 1973 on Isla Carranza, Lake Madden, yielded a date of 2020?155 radiocarbon years: 225 B.C. (1-7729). The ceramic material contained in the shaft was typologically homogeneous, the predominant decora- tion being zoned shell-stamping. This type of pottery has not been found on any other of the many sites from Lake Madden, suggesting, together with the associated date, that in this area of Panama the use of ceramics was relatively recent. In the 1974 dry season, Pedro Quir6s (Museo Nacional) continued rescue operations in the "Temple site" of El Cafno, excavated by Verrill in the twenties. In a mound adjacent to the one excavated by Cooke in 1973-which contained four urns with European beads and gold objects-he recovered three whole examples of Mendoza Polychrome. Maximo Miranda (Universidad de Panama) has completed a thesis on a site survey and testing program in the eastern sector of the Isthmus in the valleys of Pacora and the Bayano. Miranda has suggested a four-phase sequence for this area beginning at the Christian era and terminating at about A.D. 1200. OLGA F. LINARES CARIBBEAN TOBAGO. Test excavations were conducted at Golden Grove, Tobago, by the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Historical Society under the direction of Peter O'B. Harris. Surface sherds with scratched exteriors in- dicated a possible Carib site, however, decoration on the material suggests a local development of Bar- rancoid. Three predominant vessel shapes are recorded: undecorated bowls of rough paste; canaris with similar characteristics, except that some have a scratched exterior; and shallow bowls of polished paste with straight and curvilinear incised decoration mostly on interior rims, and with crude ring bases developing to flaring ring bases. The site is cross-dated at about A.D. 1000 by comparison with styles of the latest pottery at Guayaguayare, Trinidad. TRINIDAD. A well-finished oval unifacially flaked scraper (9.7 cm long) and a fragment of Megatherium rib were found at Atagual, Trinidad, an early inland ceramic site. The Trinidad and Tobago Historical Society plan to investigate the area. A small undecorated ocarina with four holes was found at Grants Trace, Trinidad, associated with pottery in the Bontour style (about A.D. 1200). The scarcity of material suggests a temporary site, possibly for wet season cultivation. CHARLES A. HOFFMAN, JR. NORTHWESTERN SOUTH AMERICA COLOMBIA. Lucia R. de Perdomo, Luisa Fer- nanda H. de Turbay, and Mauricio Londofio (Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia) completed a salvage project near Pupiales (Narifio). They examined two shaft and chamber graves looted by huaqueros. Tomb I (14 m deep) still contained fragments of tumbaga and a piece of human bone. Tomb II (7 m deep) contained only human bone and ash. A third shaft and chamber grave (1.75 m deep) which had not been discovered by the huaqueros contained fragments of human bone which yielded a date of 870?120 radiocarbon years: A.D 1104 (Ian-24). No ceramics were associated. In one test trench, ceramics were found to a depth of 1.95 m, associated at the lowest level with a charcoal date of 920?110 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1050 (Ian-23). A total of 209 sherds, including 73 from the shaft fill of Tombs I and II, were divided into four ceramic types which cor- respond with the radiocarbon dates. However, it is not certain that the two deep shaft and chamber graves themselves are of the same age. Gilberto Cadavid, Joaquin Parra, and Luisa Fernanda de Turbay (Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia) have begun a detailed archaeological project on the northern and western slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Cadavid reports that 181 "pueblos" were found during the survey. Excava- tions are scheduled to begin in January 1975. Most of the "pueblos" are between 80 and 1,600 m above sea level. Sites consist of from 150 to 1,200 circular house foundations, 5-11 m in diameter. House terraces, agricultural terraces, retaining walls, and stone roads are often associated. Coastal "pueblos" are usually characterized by stone rings 5-9 m in diameter, stone roads, and abundant surface pottery. Since the coastal sites are located on level ground, there are no house terraces. Ines Sanmiguel (Instituto Colombiano de Antro- pologia) has begun a study of the Kogui Indians in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Her data on settlement pattern is of interest to archaeologists. She reports that the San Francisco group of about 500 persons occupies a 20 km stretch along the Garavito River between 600 and 3,000 m above sea level. Between 1,200 and 2,000 m there are five major settlements in which each extended family has at least two houses. Each family also has a habitation complex of two or three structures in each thermal zone in which they have crops. Archaeological population estimates could easily go astray. 240 [Vol. 40, No. 2, 1975</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH Donald R. Sutherland (University of South Carolina, Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia) and Carson N. Murdy (INDERENA) surveyed the Isla de Salamanca which separates the Ci6naga Grande de Santa Marta from the Caribbean Sea. They found numerous shell mounds facing the Cienaga, but only one facing the sea. Test excavations were made in two multi-component sites: Cangaru, oriented toward the Caribbean; the Puerto Caiman, oriented toward the Cienaga. The lower levels of Cangaru contained ceramics related to those of the lower Magdalena River in the early Christian era; while the upper levels produced Tairona pottery. A date of 985?120 radio- carbon years: A.D. 965 (UGa-819) was obtained from transitional levels. Excavations in Puerto Caiman produced a sixteenth or seventeenth century glazed sherd at a depth of 0.50 m in an area where the refuse deposits were 2.0 m thick. Faunal evidence from both sites suggests that they were occupied between September and December. Lucia R. de Perdomo (Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia) has been working on the application of computers to archaeology. Luis Duque Gomez and Julio Cesar Cubillos continued work in tombs and habitation sites of San Agustin. Alvaro Chavaz and Mauricio Puerta excavated tombs and habitation sites at Tierradentro. Gonzalo Correal U. continued his survey for Paleo-Indian sites in the Magdalena Valley. Carlos Angulo Valdez (Universidad del Norte) ex- cavated shell mounds near the Ci6naga Grande de Santa Marta. Zaida Castellanos (Universidad de los Andes) excavated in the San Alberto site (Magdalena). Juanita Arango de Gomez (Universidad de los Andes) excavated Panche sites near Tibacuy (Cundinamarca). ECUADOR. Since 1971 the Spanish Archaeologi- cal Mission, directed by Jose Alcina Franch, has been conducting excavations on the Esmeraldas coast. The area of investigation includes about 25 km of the littoral zone between the mouth of the Esmeraldas River and Atacames. In the Balao site, located on the beach, there were datable levels of the middle Integra- tion period. Plain pottery and large quantities of fish and mollusc remains were associated with three radiocarbon dates: 970?70 radiocarbon years: A.D. 980 (C.S.I.C.-112); 1010?70 radiocarbon years: A.D. 940 (C.S.I.C.-117); and 580?100 radiocarbon years: A.D. 1370 (C.S.I.C.-116). The Propicia site is located at the confluence of the Tiaone and Esmeraldas Rivers, somewhat to the interior. Ceramics of the Regional Development period and chipped stone tools were found, but not many shells. Excavations in artificial mounds (tolas) near Atacames indicate great population density at the end of the Integration period, perhaps extending into the sixteenth century. The artifacts at this site are closely related to those of the Balao site. The Tachina site, north of the Esmeraldas River, produced ceramics related to the Chorrera phase. Miguel Rivera and Antonio Fresco (Spanish Archaeological Mission) began excavations at Ingapirca (Cafiar Province), continuing work begun by Juan Cueva. The site was divided into three sectors: El Castillo, La Condamine, and Pilaloma. An ellipsoidal Inca monument described by early travelers was reconstructed in El Castillo. Walls found in La Condamine correspond to those mapped by a French scientist in the eighteenth century. In Pilaloma, a number of buildings were found grouped about a plaza and surrounded by a semielliptical wall. In the western part of the enclosure, a large menhir was found. Next to the menhir, a collective tomb contained 11 skele- tons, accompanied by numerous copper objects and ceramic vessels. La Condamine and Pilaloma cover a pre-Inca occupation characterized by ceramic types of the Cashaloma complex. This was followed by a transitional period that marks the arrival of the Inca. Nevertheless, Inca influence alone does not account for the profound changes in the tradition of crafts- manship. The chronology of the pre-Inca occupation is difficult to evaluate, but it may have lasted as much as 1,000 years. In 1972, Linda S. Cordell, John Athens, and Alan Osborn (University of New Mexico) tested five Cara phase sites in Imbabura, cooperating with the Instituto Otavalefio de Antropologia. Artificial mounds (tolas) at Hacienda Pinsaqui, Otavalo and Socapamba were constructed of "cells" of ash and adobe blocks with earth filling at the interstices. The ceramics from the tolas were virtually all of the Cara phase. The area immediately surrounding the tolas was found to be free of habitation debris. A group of small stone tolas on communal land near Ruimapamba Alta, Ibarra, was also tested. Tests in the habitation area about 500 m northwest of the Otavalo tola group revealed a concentration of ceramics and two storage pits but no architectural features. A radiocarbon sample from the habitation area gave a date of 2670?560 radiocarbon years: 720 B.C. (CWRU-61). John Athens and Alan Osborn (University of New Mexico) continued working with Cara phase sites in Ecuador. A stratified midden at the La Chimba site included two occupational floors and contained more than 1.5 m of potsherds, faunal remains, lithic debitage, and stone artifacts. A carbon sample col- lected just above the lower occupation floor yielded a date of 1220?140 radiocarbon years: A.D. 730 (CWR-72). They also report a date of 1190?90-100 radiocarbon years: A.D. 760 (CWR-146) for the tolas at Socapamba. Warwick Bray and John Erickson (London Univer- sity Institute of Archaeology) and Elizabeth Car- michael (Museum of Mankind) recently worked near the juncture of the Jubones and Rircay Rivers in Azuay Province. Excavations at Villa Jubones (Locality 56) revealed ceramic types which are related to those of Cerro Narrio. The presence of stirrup spout bottles suggests a correlation with the Machalilla or Chorrera phases. Some anomalous sherds may be trade pieces and a Spondylus bead indicates contact with the coast. Test pits in Locality 71 have revealed a complex stratigraphy with ash lenses, stone walls and a clay floor area. Most of the ceramics are unusual for the area. Some fine wares seem to be related to the pottery of Chaullabamba. At least one piece is certainly of the Chaullabamba tradition, suggesting a date of about 1000 B.C. VENEZUELA. Erika Wagner and Kay Tarble de Ruiz (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas, IVIC) continued the analysis of the newly established Lagunillas phase, from excavations carried out near the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo. Because the Lagunillas pottery is extremely weathered and 241</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY friable, such surface treatments as painting and polish- ing have disappeared. Vessel shapes include bowls, ollas, bottles, vessels with flanges, carinated vessels, boat-shaped vessels, box-shaped vessels, vessels with constricted mouth and concave necks, and open bowls with hollow bulbous legs. Anthropomorphic figurines and zoomorphic adornos are also present, as well as microvessels and a few clay rattles. Plastic decoration on about 15% of the 23,000 sherds includes modeling, incision, applique, and the combination of these techniques. Although associated artifacts are rare, such utilitarian tools as manos and metates indicate that maize was the main agricultural product. The lack of faunal remains can be explained by the extremely poor preservation conditions (the people lived on pile dwellings and the debris was under water). This may also account for the absence of human skeletal remains. Another possibility is that the dead were cremated or buried on higher, drier ground away from the village. The pottery from Lagunillas differs from the rest of the material so far reported from the Lake Maracaibo basin. Within Venezuela, its closest similar- ities are with Santa Ana from the Trujillo area and to a certain degree with the Tocuyanoid tradition. Outside of Venezuela, there are northern Colombian in- fluences, especially from the Rancheria River area. Five radiocarbon dates place the Lagunillas phase between 2,430 and 2,160 years ago, which is ap- proximately contemporary with the dates for the oldest ceramic traditions so far established for western Venezuela, the Tocuyanoid, and Osoid traditions. THOMAS P. MYERS AMAZON AND EASTERN BRAZIL VENEZUELA. Alberta Zucchi (Instituto Ven- ezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas) surveyed Portuguesa, the northernmost state of the western Venezuelan llanos. While caves containing Tocuyanoid funerary deposits were inspected, the sites had been damaged by past guerrilla activities and modern religious practices in the area. Consequently, sys- tematic excavations could not be undertaken. Excava- tions were carried out in the flatlands of the Colonia Agricola de Tur6n. The cultural deposits indicate that the state of Portuguesa was an area of interaction among peoples bearing the Tierroid, Osoid, and Arauquinoid series cultures. PERU. Scott Raymond (University of Calgary) completed the second season of survey of the Lower Apurimac Valley in the Peruvian montana. He reports that the primary aims of the project were to tighten up the ceramic chronology for the area and to study the variations in demography and settlement distribu- tion for the millennium prior to European contact. The total inventory of sites has been increased significantly, and ceramics from surface collections and test excavations are now being analyzed. Pre- liminary analysis indicates that this section of the Upper Amazon was densely settled by Andean peoples whose presence is attested at several sites by stone- walled buildings and ceramics of the Simariba style. One such site, Palestina, covers an estimated 40 to 60 acres, comparable to the site of Vista Alegre, located in 1970. Ceramic fragments from Palestina indicate that it cross-dates with the climax of the Huari Empire in the Andean highlands. Possible contact and trade between the highlanders and the people of the tropical forest is indicated by the association of metal artifacts and modeled ceramic pieces with the Sivia ceramic style, a style related to the Cumancaya tradition of the Central Ucayali. EASTERN BRAZIL. Parana. Igor Chmyz and Joao Carlos Chmyz (Museu de Arqueologia e Artes Populares de Universidade Federal do Parana) and Joaquim Gil (Ginasio Estadual de Wenceslau Braz) completed salvage excavations in the district of Wenceslau Braz (municipio of Sao Jose da Boa Vista). Site PR-SE-3 covered an area 170 X 100 m and was marked by black areas indicating that houses were arranged in a large circle. Urns containing well preserved human bones were excavated from the central area of the circular arrangement. Pottery with painted geometric decoration and polished stone artifacts were found. Site PR-SE-3 and three other sites (PR-SE-4, 5, and 6) in the vicinity of Wenceslau Braz have been classified within the Tupiguarani tradition. Other sites characterized by pits marking subterranean houses were found in this area. These pit-house sites were composed of three or four pits about 2.5 m deep and 6-8 m wide. Excavations in one pit house (PR-SE-7) exposed hearths at a depth of 4.4 m. The few sherds found in the excavations prove that these pit houses belonged to the non-Tupiguarani, Itarar6 tradition. Radiocarbon samples from the Wenceslau Braz sites are being analyzed. Annette Laming-Emperaire directed a field school in the summer of 1973 for the Museu de Arqueologia e Artes Populares. A small preceramic sambaqui (Sambaqui do Centenario) was excavated. Sao Paulo. Luciana Pallestrini, Margarida Davina Andreatta, Agueda Vilhena de Moraes, and Silvia Maranca (Museu Paulista of the Universidade de Sao Paulo) are continuing their archaeological field re- search at sites throughout the state of Sao Paulo. Three sites (Alves, Jango Luis, and Almeida) are being excavated in the municipio of Piraju. One site (Regadas Garcia) is being excavated in the municipio of Pompeia. The Ilha Solteira project continues to salvage materials in the portion of the Parana River Valley that will be inundated upon the completion of the hydroelectric power plant at Ilha Solteira. Piauf. Silvia Maranca and Agueda Vilhena de Moraes also are participating in a project directed by Ni6de Guidon in the municipio de Sao Raimundo Nonato. They have located more than 50 cave sites with pictographs and some open sites with lithic and ceramic materials. Minas Gerais. The Instituto de Arqueologia Brasil- eira continued its research program in the Sao Fran- cisco River Valley. Ondemar Dias is working on seven sites in the upper Sao Francisco. Six of these are of the Piumhi phase of the Una tradition, and one is of the Tupiguarani tradition. Calasans Rodrigues has found five new sites on the middle Sao Francisco near Montalvania. Four of these are cave sites with petro- glyphs and pictographs. Lilia Cheviche is working on the middle Sao Francisco near Montes Claros where she has found ten sites, seven of which are cave sites with petroglyphs and pictographs. Excavations have revealed 70 cm of stratified preceramic occupation. 242 [Vol. 40, No. 2, 1975</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH Ondemar Dias (Instituto Arqueologia Brasileira) also surveyed the headwaters of the Paraiba River. Three sites were located, two of the Mucuri phase of the Una tradition and one a preceramic site with chipped quartz tools. Rio de Janeiro. Eliana T. Carvalho (Instituto do Arqueologia Brasileira) has been working on the central coast of Rio de Janeiro where she has found three sambaquis of the Macae phase, two fishing sites of the Itaipu phase, and a multi-component habitation site (Fazenda Botafogo). Fazenda Botafogo (RJ-JC-64) has been excavated by Odemar Dias, Eliana T. Carvalho, and Marcos I. Vieira. Two and one-half meters of stratified deposit revealed three distinct phases. Eight burials were associated with the last two occupational phases, Itaipu and Una. The Itaipu burials were primary and extended, while the Una burials were secondary. Una burials were accompanied by bone ornaments, bone points, and typical ceramics of the Una phase. Guanabara. Carlos M. Bandeira and Rog6rio M. Carrasco (Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira) are excavating a late eighteenth century indigo factory in the Vale do Elefante. The excavations are being carried out with the cooperation of the Centro de Conservaqco da Naturesa. Goids. In the center of the Brazilian planalto, a seven year program of archaeological research is being undertaken by the Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas and the Universidade Cat6olica de Goias. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz (Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas) is direct- ing the program with the collaboration of Altair Sales Barbosa (Universidade Cat6olica de Goias), Irmhild Wust and Itala Irene Basile Becker (Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas), and Jos6 Proenza Brochada (Universidad Federal do Rio Grande do Sul). The program approaches the first adequate general regional study covering the coastal and interior portions of the state. The five regions chosen around the important divide of the tributaries of the Amazon, Parana, and Sao Francisco Rivers will be systematically sampled, in an attempt to understand cultural adaptations to the environment as well as the history of population movements. In 1973, the first year of the program, 40 sites on the upper Tocantins were studied. In 1974, an equal number of sites were found on the upper Araguaia. While important preceramic sites were not discovered, it was possible to define three ceramic traditions. The majority of sites on the upper Tocantins and the upper Araguaia have revealed a new ceramic tradition designated Uru and divided into three phases (Uru, Uruaqcu, and Mossamedes). Some sites in this area remain unclassified. The ceramics are predominately undecorated, but both red slip and incised decoration occur. Incisions are found on the lip, edge, or along the base. The temper is predominately cariape. Plates or manioc griddles are found in the Uru and Uruacu phases. The second tradition located on the upper Araguaia is represented by the Ipora phase of the Tupiguarani painted subtradition. The ceramics are tempered with crushed sherds. A third unnamed tradition with a small representation is of the Itaberai phase. The ceramics within this tradition are tempered with sand, have globular forms, and are occasionally decorated with roulette stamping. Along the Araguaia an isolated phase called Aruafia can be differentiated from the Uru tradition by its many adornos and simple appliqu6 decoration. After further study it may be found to constitute an independent tradition. The Mossamedes and Itaberai phases, which lack manioc griddles, are encountered principally in the forest ("cerrado"), while the others all appear in bush areas ("mato"). Petroglyph sites in association with ceramic remains are found along the streams. The chronology of the Brazilian planalto is uncertain, but native ceramic traditions still exist in the area. Schmitz suggests that a shallow time depth may be represented. Further research within this program is planned for the Paranaiba River, the middle Tocantins, and the divide between the Tocantins and Sao Francisco Rivers. RONALD L. WEBER ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA ECUADOR. John Erickson (University of London) spent a lengthy 1973-74 season surveying in the vicinity of Minas, just below the confluence of the Rircay and Saraguro, where a dam is to be built. PERU. In the Lambayeque Valley, Kent Day (Royal Ontario Museum) with Izumi Shimada (Univer- sity of Arizona) completed a map of the large urban ceremonial center at Pampa Grande. Day's program of excavation began in early 1974. One aim is to find functional meaning in the distribution of artifacts and architectural remains at Pampa Grande. Oscar Lostenau (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) is preparing for publication the results of his extensive and detailed survey of the middle and lower Pacas- mayo and Rio Chaman valleys. Dating back to the period of Kosok's work, some 30 years ago, Lostenau's survey includes observations on sites now destroyed or badly altered. During the 1974 season, Richard Keatinge (Columbia University) surveyed at Pacatnamu in the Pacasmayo valley. Paul Ossa (Skidmore College) reports that he located many Paijan-type lithic sites in the Cupisnique and northern Chicama areas. Unfortunately, as of August 1974, none of the sites found contained any appreciable depth of deposit. Claude Chauchat worked at Pampa de Paijin itself. Luis Watanabe and Cristobal Campana (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) are surveying the middle and upper Moche valley above Mochal. Campana also directed stabilization and repair at Huaca Arco Iris (Huaca El Drag6n) and undertook a new study of the friezes. Antonio Rodriguez Suy Suy (Universidad Nacional de Trujillo) engaged in a broad survey of the Chicama valley, supported by Cooperativa Agro-industrial de Producci6n Cartavio. This work will be reported in a new publication, Chiquitayap. With Campana and others, Rodriguez organized the second Congreso Peruano del Hombre y La Cultura Andina, held in Trujillo in October and November 1973. Richard Schaedel (University of Texas) is surveying and excavating Moche period sites in several North Coast valleys. Sheila Griffiths Pozorsky (Texas) com- pleted the survey of the Moche Valley for the Harvard Moche-Chan Chan project. Thomas Pozorsky ex- 243</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY cavated at the Los Reyes Chavin complex (Caballo Muerto). Michael West (Los Angeles County Museum) re- surveyed the Viru valley and excavated extensively in Gallinazo period sites. His program emphasizes man- land relationships, the determination of micro- environments within the valley, the influence of soil types on settlement pattern, and problems of water management and salinization. Patricia Netherly (Cornell University) finished her archaeological reconnaissance of late period sites in conjunction with her ethnohistorical research on local lords in the valleys between Chao and Motupe. With Thomas Dillehay (University of Texas), Netherly mapped Cao Viejo, a late pre-Hispanic and colonial site near Huaca Prieta in the Chicama valley. I thank Netherly for her help in compiling this section on Peru. Lorenzo Samaniego R. (Proyecto Casma, ORDEZA) has nearly completed the program of excavation, cleaning, consolidation, and restoration of the Cerro Sechin monument, undertaken as a con- sequence of the 1970 earthquake. During excavations in 1971 and 1972 he discovered 183 new stone carvings, bringing the total to 302, found early formative (pre-Chavin) ceramics under the major stone constructions, and established that the carved mono- liths were not freestanding, but set as a sort of mosaic in adobe mortar against the stone wall of the temple. An earlier, earthen temple mound was decorated with painted low reliefs and murals featuring felines and fishes. Samaniego has concluded that the stone-faced temple erected over the original earthen structure was as much political as religious in its significance. In 1974 he chiefly analyzed cultural material already recovered, but Samaniego also explored at the cere- monial center of Mojeque in Pampa de Llamas, Chanquillo on the left side of the Rio Casma, and at Sechin Alto. The area around Puerto de Supe is also being reinvestigated and reinterpreted. The Aspero site, visited by Gordon Willey and Michael Mosely in 1971, was subject to more recent work by Robert Feldman (Harvard University) who excavated at a number of sites in the Supe valley. Duccio Bonavia (Universidad Cayetano Heredia) has finished a lengthy study of painted murals dating from the Initial Period to the Late Horizon. He has dealt with chemical analysis of the pigments as well as the more usual stylistic and representational concerns. Josefina Ramos de Cox (Universidad Cat6olica) died of cancer July 12, 1974. As acting director, Mercedes Cardenas continues the work of her Seminario at Tablada de Lurin and at Huaca Dos Palos and adjacent sites in the Maranga area. Ramos was one of few archaeologists to work the Lima area systematically and to bring ecological and geomorphological studies to bear on the archaeology of Lima. She was a pioneer in salvage archaeology and trained many students. Jorge C. Muelle, formerly Director of the Museo de Antropologia y Arqueologia, died in September 1974. Hugo Ludefia, director of the archaeology section of the Instituto Nacional de Cultura, has been working on the Chavin horizon in the Chillo6n valley. Luis Lumbreras continues to reorganize and plan the future development of the Museo Nacional de Antropologia y Arqueologia, which reopened in 1974 with new exhibits. In 1973 Lumbreras and several associates conducted a short survey in the altiplano, trying to correlate sites mentioned in sixteenth century documents with archaeological sites on the ground. Lumbreras is planning archaeological work at Pucara in the southern sierra as part of a larger study of this region. Edouard Versteylen (Museo Nacional de Antro- pologia y Arqueologia) is leading the "Proyecto de Investigaci6n Textil Julio C. Tello," in which the mummy bundles from Huaca Malena in the Asia valley are to be opened, thoroughly studied, and preserved. According to project coordinator James Vreeland (Dartmouth College) other aims of the project are the compilation of a unified terminological lexicon, a textile library at the museum, and the collection of ethnographic data on use of natural dyes in Andean weaving. Frederic Engel (Universidad Agraria) continues to work in the lower Chillo6n valley and in the lomas zone of the south coast. In Lima the staff of the Instituto de Antropologia y Agricultura Precolombina is studying artifacts and data collected earlier. Thomas Dillehay (University of Texas) completed a survey and test excavations of late (Middle Horizon to Colonial) sites in the middle Chillo6n valley. Special attention was paid to the Inca administrative center at Huancaya Alto. Dillehay is trying to integrate his work with information from sixteenth century documents on the region, published by Maria Rostworowski de Diez Canseco (Museo Nacional de Antropologia) who has just returned from archival research in Spain. Staff from the Museo de Arqueologia of the Universidad de San Marcos continue to excavate and restore the ruins at Chavin de Huantar under the overall direction of Rosa Fung. Heather Lechtman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) is engaged in a survey of Precolumbian ore sources and metal-working sites of the Peruvian sierra. At Huanuco Pampa, Craig Morris (Brandeis Univer- sity) excavated in new areas of the site, gaining further insight into the nature of the "elite" eastern complex and several subsidiary areas. The first intact pottery- apparently an offering-was discovered undisturbed under a door stone. Morris has completed excavations but will return for three months in 1975 to work exclusively on analysis. Ramiro Matos M. (Universidad de San Marcos) continues his long-term interdisciplinary investigation of prehistoric high altitude adaptation on the Puna de Junin. For the last decade, Matos has conducted surveys and test excavations in the Junin region, aimed primarily at the preceramic and Initial periods. The program has been broadened to include studies of the Quaternary environmental history by H. E. Wright and J. P. Bradbury (University of Minnesota), pre- historic faunal remains from Pachamachay Cave by Elizabeth Wing (Florida State Museum), and modern fauna and ethnobotany by Kent Flannery and Michael Brown (University of Michigan). John Rick, with a joint Michigan-San Marcos team, found that open air sites are rare or effectively hidden by puna vegetation and that they have little lithic debris. However, about 10 km west of Ondores along the east bank of the Rio 244 [Vol. 40, No. 2, 1975</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH Mantaro, they located a number of preceramic sites in and around rockshelters. Rick also made a survey of the lithic raw material available in the Junin area. In a somewhat similar joint project, William Isbell (SUNY, Binghamton) is working with a team from the Universidad Cat6olica of Lima, focusing on the Middle Horizon of the Ayacucho valley. Arminda Gibaja de Valencia has finished excava- tions at Choqepujyo, a site in the Huacarpay basin, which had a Lucre and Inca occupation. The report is in the form of a thesis for the Universidad de Cuzco. Excavations, cleaning, and stabilization continue at the Saqsaywaman complex, led by Italo Oberti (In- stituto Nacional de Cultura). Jos6 Luis Lorenzo (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Mexico) is also working in the Cuzco area. Abraham Valencia and Mario Nufiez (Instituto Nacional de Cultura) began a program in the Depart- ment of Puno, first locating and cataloging the sites and monuments, and then excavating some. They have discovered Tiahuanaco sites along the Desaguadero Peruano near the Bolivian border. F6lix Palacios (Universidad Cat6olica) has prepared a report on a preceramic site he discovered and excavated in the community of Chichillape, Province of Chucuito, Department of Puno. Jorge Flores (Universidad de Cuzco) is assembling a book of readings on camelid pastoralism, past and present. Elias Mujica (Universidad Cat6olica) and John Hyslop (Columbia University) are surveying the area of the sixteenth century Lupaqa kingdom, near Lake Titicaca and westward to the coast. They will attempt to integrate data from their survey and limited excavations with information already available in the 1567 Diez de San Miguel visita to Chucuito, published by John V. Murra (Cornell University). CHILE AND THE SOUTHERN ANDES. Jos6 Antonio P6rez (Universidad Nacional de La Plata) began a program of study and excavations in the Department of Iruya (Salta) at the northeastern extremity of the Argentine Andes. P6rez hopes to collect data on the beginnings of agriculture and domestication of plants. Another goal of the project is to demonstrate trans-Andean relationships with the Norte Grande of Chile. Under the direction of Mario A. Rivera, archaeolo- gists from the Universidad del Norte at Arica are undertaking the complete excavation of Alto Ramirez. They are particularly interested in Tiwanaku influence on the area. The university now has its own journal, Chungara. Augustin Llangostera and Victor Bustos (Univer- sidad del Norte, Antofagasta) are surveying the coast near Antofagasta. They excavated a preceramic site near Tocopilla, and also Los Canastos, about 10 km north of Antofagasta, which yielded a few sherds of San Pedro II negro pulido. Staff members of the Universidad de Chile (Sede Antofagasta) continue work at the open air site of Tiliviche in the Quebrada de Tarapaca. Preliminary typological studies of chipped stone tools, fauna, and vegetal remains from Tiliviche and Aragon suggest a circuit of transhumance involving the Pampa del Tamarugal and the Pisagua coast. The research station of the Universidad del Norte at San Pedro de Atacama has become the focus of a number of projects led by Gustavo LePaige, Lautaro Nunfez, and George Serracino. Valle Chico, a new preceramic site 14 km northeast of San Pedro, is assigned to the "pre-projectile point" stage. The choppers are like those from the Ghatchi site, and no projectile points were found in an intensive and systematic surface collection. Pollen samples from Valle Chico are under analysis by botanists from the Universidad de Concepci6n. At Sequitor Alambrado, excavators found 45 tombs dating to the middle horizon of San Pedro. The early and middle horizon town of Tulor extends over more than 2 km and has a number of circular buildings made of tapia. At the late period site of Guatin studies have been made of the field systems, isolated houses, and relationships with larger centers. Lautaro Nifunez, as director of the Chilean branch of the Smithsonian Paleo-Indian Program, has brought together a group of investigators (Juan Munizaga, p h ysical anthropologist; Rodolfo Casamiquela, paleontologist; Juan Varela, sedimentologist; and Hector J. De Antoni, palynologist) to examine early sites in Chile. Work starts with the Tambillo site in San Pedro de Atacama. With E. Franulic, Nufiez is editing and publishing the papers on agriculture, verticality, and transhumance from the 1973 Congreso del Hombre Andino. Serracino edits the new serial Estudios Atacamefos and Documentos para la In- vestigaci6n issued by the Museum at San Pedro. Carlos Thomas and Patricio Morel (Universidad de Chile, Santiago) finished four years of work at the late period pukara and settlement of Chiu Chiu. They are attempting to reconstruct social structure through an analysis of house inventories and architecture. They were able to determine that household heads were buried in the courtyards while others were relegated to a cemetery outside the settlement. Mario Orellana and students (Universidad de Chile, Santiago) are studying Tiwanaku motifs from snuff tablets, tubes, and other exotic artifacts housed in the museums at Arica and San Pedro de Atacama. Early sixteenth century fortifications on the island of Juan Fernandez are the subject of another of Orellana's projects. Virgilio Schiappacasse, Hans Niemeyer, Sylvia Quevodo, and Patricio Urquieta continued excavations at a cemetery associated with a large preceramic shell midden, 10 km north of La Serena. A sample of 100 skeletons, the largest burial population known from central Chile, is under analysis by specialists. Niemeyer and various collaborators also pursued their studies of Chilean rock art with an eighth and final expedition to the Cordillera de Linares (now published), more collection of materials in the Norte Chico from Copiapo to the valley of Aconcagua, and a short trip to the Paposo district (Province of Antofagasta). Above the fog line, between 1,500 and 2,000 m elevation, but no more than 5 or 6 km from the coast, they recorded naturalistic maritime scenes of fish and skin boats. Horacio Larrain and collaborators (Universidad Cat6olica, Santiago) worked at Poroma and Coscaya above the Pampa del Tamarugal. Their research in ethnohistory and related fields will continue to be published in the new journal, Norte Grande. Construction activity brought to light another Inca cemetery in La Reina Santiago. It was salvaged by 245</page><page sequence="9">246 AMERICAN Ruben Stehberg (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural). The Universidad de Concepci6n sponsored a fourth and final season of excavations at the rockshelter of San Pedro Viejo (Pichasca) in the Department of Ovalle. All the wall paintings have been recorded, new charcoal samples will be dated, and a remarkable late preceramic skeleton will be studied by J. Munizaga (Universidad de Chile, Santiago). Other major par- ticipants in the project were Gonzalo Ampuero (now at Universidad del Norte, Arica), Mario Rivera (Arica), and Osvaldo Silva (Universidad de Chile, Santiago). IA kNTIQUITY [Vol. 40, No. 2, 1975 William Mulloy (University of Wyoming), Gonzalo Figueroa, and students from the Universidad del Norte, Antofagasta, began excavating sites on Easter Island. I wish to thank George Serracino and Osvaldo Silva for providing me with information on fieldwork in Chile. Both are now engaged in library research and study at Cornell University. THOMAS F.
