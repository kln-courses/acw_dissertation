<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comparable Institutions: The Royal Hospital for Seamen and the Hdtel des Invalides by JOHN BOLD When Nicholas Hawksmoor recalled the circumstances of the building of the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich (Fig. I), begun in 1696, he twice made the point that the achievement of magnificence was part of the architectural brief. In his Remarks on the Founding and Carrying on the Buildings of the Royal Hospital at Greenwich, published in 1728, he noted that it was the desire of the foundress, Queen Mary, 'who had a great Passion for Building', 'to build the Fabrick with great Magnificence and Order'. Later, as if defending a position, Hawksmoor noted 'her Majesty's fixt Intention for Magnificence'.1 Queen Mary had died in 1694 but her husband King William III, respecting her wishes, had ensured the continuation of the project under the architectural guidance of Christopher Wren who was assisted by Hawksmoor in this great endeavour. Dr Johnson was famously critical of the architecture of the Hospital, finding it, during a visit made in 1763 shortly after its completion, 'too magnificent for a place of charity'.2 But, as Christine Stevenson has shown in her reading of Bethlem Hospital, a distinction should be drawn between luxury and magnificence.3 Magnificent lodgings and the idea of charity are not at odds when 'magnificent' is defined as 'characterised by expenditure or munificence on a great scale'.4 It may be charitable to be magnificent when that magnificence is an indicator of a noble liberality. Dr Johnson perhaps was missing the point. The Hospital was required to present a magnificent face to the world on the main route into London from continental Europe in order to demonstrate the political and naval power of the state and the charitable duty felt by the monarch and other benefactors to shelter those who had spent their lives in its service. Wren was fully aware of such a need: 'Architecture has its political Use; publick Buildings being the Ornament of a Country; it establishes a Nation, draws People and Commerce, makes the People love their native Country, which Passion is the Original of all great Actions in a Commonwealth.'s Greenwich Hospital was not alone in making such a statement. Edward Hatton in 1708 had recourse to a familiar analogy when he likened both Greenwich and the earlier Chelsea Hospital for soldiers (founded in 1682) to palaces for princes,6 and Robert Bargrave, travelling in Spain in the I640s, considered the 'common prison' in Madrid to be 'a faire fabrick . . . fit</page><page sequence="2">COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS 137 rather for a Prince's palace than an offenders gaol, and to live in it must needs be more a pleasure than a penalty; were it not Plague enough to be confined.'7 But the pre- eminent example of magnificent institutional building, an inspiration for the architects of Greenwich Hospital and along with the Palais du Luxembourg, the Louvre and the Tuileries, one of the sights of Paris,8 was Louis XIV's H6tel des Invalides, established in 1670 for the care of invalid veterans (Fig. 2). On his Grand Tour in 1730, William Mildmay of Essex visited the Invalides and reflected on the nature of architectural magnificence in the service of a charitable cause: The Hotel des Invalides being a Hospital for disabled Soldiers, has the Air of a Palace, as the Louvre has that of an Hospital, tis a foundation becoming the soul of a military prince. Here is a handsome maintenance for 5000 men, who have suffered by any wounds received in the service of their country, including also officers who are entertained according to the dignity of their several stations ... The building is large regular and noble with proper ornaments over the portals and upon the balustrades, of Trophies and Military Ensigns, but what principally demanded our admiration, is the new church; the outside is a neat square with pillars of the corinthian and composite order, and a cupola on the top ... the Dome is finely painted, the pilasters neatly finished, and the whole execution in a taste above the tawdry embellishments of gilding which the French so much affect. I have often heard it observed that in acts of Charity of this publick nature for the encouragement of souldiers or sea men, the money which is thus thrown away as it were on building and outward ornament had better have been spared towards makeing a more ample supply of Provisions and necessaries, and that more beef and worse beds would give greater contentment to these wretches. However true this may be to the English, tis not wholely so as to the french, who are generally more taken with outside show and appearance; and I believe tis with chearfulness these men abate a pound of meat in a week, for the sake of being so magnificently lodged... This is indeed the most magnificent, but there are several other publick societies in Paris establish'd either towards the meer relief of Indigent persons, or towards the education of Youth, and the encouragement of Learning in men ... Jules Hardouin-Mansart's magnificent dome, admired by Mildmay, was itself an inspiration for the twin domes of Greenwich Hospital. A later visitor, critical of that authoritarian, grand architecture which in his view denoted a political system which is neglectful of 'the inward parts of the machinery of society', nevertheless provided a wonderfully anthropomorphic image of the dome whilst decrying the vulgarity of later tawdry embellishments: Behind this palace [the Palais Bourbon], the gilded dome of the Hotel des Invalides heaves up its gorgeous swell. Buonaparte committed this piece of atrocious gilding, and it is not one of the weakest proofs of several, of his barbarous taste. Glittering, however, in a clear blue sky, and forming a part in the composition of a most magnificent picture, it is very impressive as an object. . .1o Greenwich Hospital was founded principally 'for the reliefe and Support of seamen serving on board the Shipps or Vessels belonging to the Navy Royall who by reason of Age, Wounds or other disabilities shall be uncapable of further Service at Sea and be unable to maintain themselves.'1 It was established at a time when England began to rival the provision of charitable institutions already established in Italy and France,</page><page sequence="3">....r~. ..~ ? rrp.

Cr CA z CA Cj</page><page sequence="5">140 ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 44: 2001 although the admiration of English visitors for continental hospitals continued well into the eighteenth century when the products of a golden age of hospital building in London prompted the change in direction which brought Dr Jacques Tenon to England in 1787 in the course of drawing up proposals for improving the hospitals of Paris.12 Wren visited Paris in 1665-66, before Les Invalides had been begun, but information about its foundation and its architecture would have been readily available to him by the time he was designing the hospitals at Chelsea and Greenwich. According to L'Abb6 Perau, author of the large folio volume Description Historique de l'Hdtel Royal des Invalides, published in Paris in 1756, King Charles II, struck by the accounts of the building which he had received from 'Seigneurs Anglois', requested a plan of it from Louis XIV,13 and drawings arrived in 1678.14 In Perau's view, the importance of the Invalides lay in its celebration of the glory of the state and in its provision of a tranquil resting place for those who had suffered the misfortunes of war. Louis XIV took a close personal interest in the building, visiting regularly during the course of the works, once incognito and at other times with all due pomp, but always with 'un nouveau plaisir'.15 The importance of Les Invalides for both Greenwich and Chelsea was reiterated in 1791 by 'M.L.T.' when its future was in doubt because of a proposal by the military to replace it with a number of separate hospitals.16 Arguments for its retention were successfully marshalled: grandeur and national pride at one end of the spectrum; economies of scale at the other; and, moreover, 'plusieurs Peuples voisins, frappes d'un si grand exemple, se sont empresses de le suivre. Les Anglois ont biti l'Hospice de Greenwich, qui ne cede pas en magnificence a l'H6tel, et celui de Chelsea destine pour les Invalides de terre.'17 In view of the remarks made by both Dr Johnson and William Mildmay, it is ironic that M.L.T. considered that the English better understood the importance of such hospitals in national life - on the immense terrace at Greenwich the sailor towards the end of life can contemplate the element which brought him glory. Although this grand vision was indulged by many of the artists who celebrated the battered heroes in numerous paintings, it was not shared by all visitors to Greenwich. A more mundane but perhaps more accurate assessment was made in 1810 by Louis Simond, an American visitor who found the Hospital very beautiful but the old sailors 'tired and melancholy ... warming themselves in the sun, or crawling languidly along the magnificent colonnades or porticoes, of which the elegance and beauty makes a sad contrast with their crippled, infirm and dependent old age'.18 The first published account of Les Invalides, a Description gn&amp;arale, by Le Jeune de Boulencourt, was issued in 1683.19 This inspired an anonymous English translation in 1695, prompted by a desire to support the 'Noble Resolution' of King William III in carrying out the wishes of the late Queen Mary. Dedicated to the king, A Pattern of a Well-Constituted and Well-Governed Hospital reminds William that the foundation of the Hospital will be 'one of the most illustrious and most Useful Monuments of Your Majesty's Wisdom and Piety, as well as of Your Power and Greatness'.20 Greenwich was intended from the beginning to be a statement both political and charitable. Although, as might be expected, the architecture of Les Invalides is found to be 'not much inferior to the Louvre itself', it is the 'admirable Order, Discipline, and good</page><page sequence="6">COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS 141 Oeconomy that is established and practised there' which most inspires the author who hopes to see at Greenwich 'that good Order and Discipline, those Methods of Oeconomy and Police established and faithfully observed, that we have been admiring and commending in our Neighbour Nation'.21 Les Invalides was designed to accommodate 5,000 veterans, twice the number of Greenwich, but whilst differing in size the two institutions were comparable in grandeur as well as in political and moral ambition. Les Invalides, however, was initially more inclusive than Greenwich which confined itself to accommodating veterans of the Royal Navy. At Les Invalides, foreign veterans of all religions could be housed until 1685 when the 'violent invasion' upon the Edict of Nantes revoked the rights of protestants which had been granted by Henri IV in 1598.22 The five Englishmen (of the 84 Protestants) who were housed in Les Invalides pragmatically converted to Catholicism; the twenty Scots set more store by their beliefs and so were sent away; the Ioo Irish presented no problem since 'there was hardly any one but seemed to be born with a Pope in his Belly'.23 Whatever their background, what is more surprising than to see so great a Number of Men, of different Countries and Humours, used to all the Licenciousness and Dissoluteness of a Military Life, so Reformed in their Behaviour and Morals, as to become the soberest, civillest, modestest and the most Industrious men in the whole Nation, to live in a Society under those rules of good Discipline and Order, without noise, quarrelling, gaming, drinking, cheating, stealing, giving ill Language, Whoreing, Swearing, or any such Irregularities?24 It was in their industriousness that the pensioners of Les Invalides differed most from those at Greenwich. In Paris there were four great halls over the four refectories to provide space for learning and practising trades. It was hoped that all the clothes for the army eventually would be made at the hospital. This manufacture enabled the pensioners to earn the money which enabled a measure of independence. Unlike Greenwich where the pensioners were given an allowance of one shilling per week, those in Paris received no allowance, it being 'their own Fault and Laziness that they do not make honest shifts to deserve some.'25 Even though they were models of industriousness, the French pensioners were not always as well behaved as the above account suggests. The blind soldiers, for example, had two or three tables to themselves so that they would not be cheated of their victuals by the sighted. Punishments for transgressions at Les Invalides and Greenwich reflected the relative significance accorded to deviant behaviours in each country. If guilty of swearing or blasphemy - three days in the pillory in France, loss of one day's diet in England; drunkenness - loss of one day's diet in England but in France eight days in prison on a diet of bread and water, followed by twenty-two days dining at the 'water table', without wine; for a second and third offence this punishment was first doubled and then trebled; after a fourth offence the pensioner could never go out again. In France, 'to say or do Insolent and Provoking things' was rewarded with a period in the stocks, whilst in England defilement, defacing or lying caused the offender to be exposed in the hall with a broom and shovel tied to him for the duration of three meals. Frequenting whores or houses of ill repute led in England to a diet of bread and water for a week, whilst to 'haunt or frequent Wenches, or bring Naughty</page><page sequence="7">142 ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 44: 2001 Women into the House' might result in France in both parties being tied back-to- back for several hours on the wooden horse in full view of all passers-by. The most striking of these differences lies in the attitude towards drunkenness. At Greenwich the pensioners were allowed four pints of beer per day, a ration so jealously guarded that on those occasions when the beer was off, the men received compensation. Going into the nearby town and drinking more in convivial company was normal practice for men who had little to do. In France they received about half a pint of very good wine before soberly going back to work on the manufacture of uniforms.26 Although the governors of Greenwich Hospital in a spirit of competition or enquiry tended to look initially to Chelsea for examples to emulate or to surpass,27 they did look also to Les Invalides, although perhaps with more circumspection when England and France were at war. When the closure of Greenwich began to be considered in the Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into Greenwich Hospital (I860), the comparison with Les Invalides was clearly not advantageous. The administrators and officers at Greenwich had been criticized spasmodically for over eighty years for privatizing public spaces, taking the best river-front apartments for themselves and spending too much money on their own accommodation. The situation grew worse as the number of resident pensioners declined during the first half of the nineteenth century as more and more took the opportunity of receiving 'out-pensions' which enabled them to receive an allowance whilst living in more domestic circumstances.28 By 1860, the cost per resident pensioner at Greenwich was almost twice the cost at Les Invalides:29 Cost of maintenance Cost of discipline, Total cost ofpensioner per year administration, fabric per year etc., per year Les Invalides (1848) ?26 ?5 ?3I Greenwich (1805) ?28 ?9 ?37 Greenwich (1859) ?30 ?28 ?58 A further critical Report would be required30 and another nine years would pass before the last able-bodied pensioners left Greenwich Hospital in 1869, but in view of the financial comparison carried out in 1860 it was quite clear that over a century of rivalry and comparison in the provision of charitable magnificence was about to come to a close. Arthur Young, travelling in France on the eve of the Revolution, dined at Les Invalides with Antoine Parmentier, 'the apostle of the potato'. He failed to describe the building, but inspired by the 'vast rotunda' of the galleried corn market in Paris, 'as light as if suspended by the fairies', succinctly pinpointed the combination of factors which cause such magnificent public edifices to succeed or fail: ... if an appropriation of the parts to the conveniences wanted, and an adaptation of every circumstance to the end required, in union with that elegance which is consistent with use, and that magnificence which results from stability and duration are the criteria of public edifices, I know nothing that equals it. . 31 The governors of Greenwich Hospital, unlike their equivalents at Les Invalides, had failed to achieve the appropriate balance, losing sight of the former in their pursuit and</page><page sequence="8">COMPARABLE INSTITUTIONS 143 celebration of the latter. In 1870, the Infirmary of the Royal Hospital, built in 1764-68 to the designs of James Stuart, was leased to the Seamen's Hospital Society as the Dreadnought Seamen's Hospital for the relief of merchant seamen. In 1873, the Royal Naval College took over the four magnificent ranges of Hospital buildings designed and inspired by Wren and Hawksmoor, remaining in occupation until 1998. The H6tel des Invalides continues in part to fulfil its original purpose.32 As well as housing the Musee de l'Armee and a number of military services, veterans of the army are accommodated in the eight ranges of infirmary buildings which were added by Jules Hardouin-Mansart in 1679 to the original grand H6tel begun to the design of Liberal Bruant nine years earlier. Securely remote from scenes of conflict, there they may contemplate the dome which soars above the grandiloquent granite sarcophagus of the Emperor Napoleon.
