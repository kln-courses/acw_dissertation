Decker, and Thomas R. Perl Collision Safety Engrg., Inc. ABSTRACT Recent detailed field accident data are examined with regard to injuries associated with rear impacts. The distribution of "Societal Harm" associated with various injury mechanisms is presented, and used to evaluate the performance of current seat back and restraint system designs. Deformation associated with seat back yield is shown to be beneficial in reducing overall Societal Harm in rear impacts. The Societal Harm associated with ejection and contact with the vehicle rear interior (the two injury mechanisms addressed by a rigid seat approach), is shown to be minimal. The field accident data also confirm that restraint usage in rear impacts has a substantial injury-reducing effect. Laboratory tests and computer simulations were run to investigate the mechanism by which seat belts protect occupants in rear impacts. INTRODUCTION In 1987, Collision Safety Engineering presented a paper concerning the performance of production front seats and active seat belt systems in rear impacts [Strother, 1987], Accident statistics from the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) and the National Accident Sampling System (NASS) were analyzed to understand the relative priority of rear impacts and evaluate the performance of production seats in the rear end crash mode. The effectiveness of seat belts in rear impacts was investigated by reviewing conclusions reached by investigators who had analyzed both restrained and unrestrained subjects in dynamic tests. At that time, the only accident field study available addressing the issue of seat belt effectiveness in rear impacts indicated that belts reduced the incidence of any injury by 12 percent and decreased the incidence of serious injury by over 57 percent. Since 1987, several studies examining field accident data on rear impacts have been published. These studies provide more detailed insights into the relative importance of this accident mode, as well as information on how occupants are injured in such collisions. They also provide further additional understanding of the role of energy absorbing seat backs in injury mitigation and the potential consequences of rigidized seat structures. The beneficial effects of seat belt use in rear impacts is also consistently demonstrated by field accident studies conducted during recent years. These studies are in general agreement with each other concerning not only the benefit of seat belt use in rear collisions, but also in the magnitude of the effectiveness of belts in this impact situation. The mechanism by which seat belts restrain occupants in rear collisions is shown to be due to the forces acting on an occupant's lower body during such an impact. The results of a series of rear impact dynamic tests using cadaver subjects are examined and used as a basis for mathematical occupant simulations based on the Motor Vehicle Manufacturer's Association (MVMA) 2- Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator Program. These simulations demonstrate the effect of a seating position more representative of production automobiles than that employed in the original cadaver tests. In both the cadaver tests and the simulations, the lower body of a belted occupant in a rear impact is observed to articulate such that the lap belt is retained in position on the hips during the collision, limiting the rearward and upward trajectory motion of the torso and head. REAR IMPACT FIELD ACCIDENT STUDIES Early field accident data from Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) and NCSS indicated that rear impacts deserve a low safety priority by comparison to other accident modes. The 1 970-1 985 FARS data showed that less than 4% of occupant fatalities occur in impacts with a Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) of 5-7 o'clock. The NCSS data suggested that part of the explanation for the relatively low percentage of serious injuries and fatalities in rear impacts was the generally lower distribution of accident severities in this mode. However, NCSS data also indicated that for a given impact severity the probability of serious injury was significantly less for rear impacts than for side or frontal impacts. This finding information in brackets refers to references listed at end of paper. 2019</page><page sequence="2">suggested that the vehicle protective system, including the vehicle seats, was providing a high level of protection in rear impacts [Strother, 1987], Recently, investigators have made more detailed analysis of rear impact field accident data. In December of 1 987, the National Highway T raffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) analyzed the 1982-1986 FARS data [Partyka, 1987], The focus of the study was to compare fatality rates in various sizes of vehicles struck in the rear. Not surprisingly, it was concluded that the fatality rate for small cars (i.e. cars weighing less than 3000 pounds) was higher than the fatality rate for larger cars, but overall fatalities for rear-impacted passenger cars were found to be less than 3% of the total (see Figure 1). FIGURE 1: FATAUTIES BY COLUSION TYPE, FARS 82-86 PASSENGER CAR OCCUPANT FATAUTIES [Partyka, 1987] Additional conclusions may be drawn from the data presented in the 1987 Partyka study. While FARS does not have a coded measure of impact severity (such as the impact velocity change (delta-V)), it is possible to approximate severity levels from other coded data. For example, the majority of rear impact fatalities occurred in a struck vehicle which was stopped, where relatively large closing velocities were more likely. Over 90 percent of the rear-impacted vehicles with fatalities were coded as having "disabling/severe" damage. The rear impact fatalities generally occurred in accidents where a larger vehicle impacted the subject vehicle. Thirty percent of the fatalities were in cars struck by large trucks, and over forty-one percent were in cars struck by either pickup trucks, vans, or large cars. FARS does have a variable for "travel speed," although there is no basis for estimating its accuracy because there is no accident reconstruction procedure in FARS, as there is in NCSS and NASS. Further, this variable was coded "unknown" for over half of the vehicles. Recognizing these limitations, the FARS data indicated that over 83 percent of the rear impact fatalities occurred in accidents where the striking vehicle was travelling over 40 miles-per-hour. It is also interesting to note that in over 25 percent of the rear impact fatalities in two-vehicle accidents, there was some indication of alcohol involvement on the part of the striking vehicle driver. Another rear impact study was conducted by Data Link, Inc. in July of 1989 [Data Link, 1989]. The accident data in both FARS and NASS were evaluated. The FARS data indicated that rear end impacts account for 4.4 percent of all fatal crashes involving passenger cars and 3.5 percent of all passenger car occupant fatalities. Like the earlier Partyka study, the Data Link analysis of the FARS data indicated that smaller cars have higher casualty rates than larger cars in rear impacts. This trend is generally true of all accident modes, but in rear impacts the sensitivity to car size was found to be even more pronounced. Further, the number of car fatalities for all impact modes was seen to be decreasing from 1978 to 1988, the absolute rates for fatalities in rear impacts were observed to remain relatively constant. Table 1, taken from the Data Link study, combines the NASS data with the FARS data. The proportion of injured occupants involved in rear impacts is relatively high. While only 12.2 percent of crash-involved occupants were in a rear impact, 23.3 percent of the injured occupants were in such collisions. However, these injuries are predominately minor. Only 7.6 percent of all TABLE 1: REAR IMPACTS 1981-1986 NASS/FARS [From Table A- 9 , Data Link 1989] PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL ASSOCIATED Wl TH REAR IMPACTS All Car Crashes 11.1% Fatal Car Crashes 4.9% Al I Crash Involved Occupants 12.2% All Injured Occupants 23.3% Seriously Injured (AIS 3-6) 7.6% Occupant Fatalities 3. 5% AIS 3 or greater injuries are associated with rear impacts. Data Link found that the NASS data were in agreement with the FARS data with regard to the over-representation of small cars in rear-impact casualties (Table 2). This over-representation is attributable to the fact that most rear impacts are car-to-car impacts, where conservation of momentum puts the smaller car at a disadvantage in terms of accident severity. Figure 2 shows that the accident severity seen by occupants of small cars in rear impacts is greater than the accident severity level seen by occupants of larger cars. Table 3 shows the distribution of injury severities (AIS) to occupants in towed, rear- impacted vehicles. Note that these NASS and FARS data indicate that only 1 percent of the injuries sustained by occupants in towed rear-impacted vehicles was an AIS 3 or greater injury. A third analysis of rear impacts, also by Data Link Inc., was conducted in February of 1990 [Data Link, 1990]. This study used 1979-1986 NASS data to investigate a number of specific issues raised in a petition to NHTSA which resulted in the initiation of a public docket on seat issues [54 FR 40897, 1989]. A review of the docketed rulemaking regarding seats is given in a companion paper [Warner, 1991]. The selected NASS files contained 4273 rear-impacted vehicles and 7399 occupants. One of the specific issues analyzed was the yielding or non-yielding of seat backs (the yielding of the seat back was termed "seat back support failure" by Data Link). Since NASS does not specifically code for seat back yield, these data had to be extracted from individual accident investigation files. The post-impact seat back condition was determined by reviewing the investigator notes and by examining the post-crash photographs.

Of the total 116 cases selected for review, about 60 percent indicated some evidence of seat back yield or "failure", about 15 percent had insufficient data to make a determination and the remaining 25 percent indicated no detectable yield. Recognizing the limitations in this analysis, it was nevertheless concluded that seat back yield was quite frequent for the crash severities investigated (i.e. for delta-V's above 15 miles-per-hour). This finding is consistent with earlier findings regarding the relationship between accident severity and seat back yield based on laboratory crash tests [Strother, 1987], It is interesting that the 1990 Data Link study noted no readily evident relation between the magnitude of seat back deformation and crash severity. It was also noted that the majority of seat backs deformed less than completely. This indicates that the energy absorbing characteristics of production seats were rarely exceeded, even though this sampling of accidents focused on more severe impacts. In evaluating the consequences associated with seat back yield, the concept of "Harm" was used [Malliaris, 1985]. This concept consists of assigning weighting values to the various levels of injury. The amount of "Harm" associated with specific injury sources can then be calculated by adding the weighted values for all injuries associated with those sources. This allows comparison of high frequency, lower severity injuries to low frequency, high severity injuries. In evaluating the potential danger of yielding seat backs, of particular interest is the Harm associated with contacts in the rear compartment by front seat occupants, and the Harm associated with front seat occupant ejections. Table 4 shows the Harm associated with front seat, unrestrained occupants, broken down by the area of injury source. In interpreting the data in Table 4, it should be pointed out that Type 1 rear impacts are vehicle- vehicle rear impacts where no other impact takes place. Type 2 rear impacts involve three vehicles in a train-like configuration wherein the subject car is the middle vehicle 2021</page><page sequence="4">TABLE 4: DISTRIBUTION OF HARM TO FRONT SEAT UNRESTRAINED OCCUPANTS BY SOURCE OF MOST SEVERE INJURY, FOR VARIOUS CAR IMPACT TYPES NASS 1976-1986 [From Tablo 13, Data Link 1990] INJURY REAR REAR REAR ALL ALL SOURCE TYPE 1 TYPE 2 TYPE 3 REAR OTHER FRONT 11. 27% 30.27% 16.14% 14.3% 33.3% SIDE 1.44% 1.82% 10.38% 3.9% 10.0% SEAT BACK 4.29% 7.03% 6.53% 5.1% 0.3% HEAD RESTR 3.45% 7.93% 2.55% 3.6% 0.1% OTHER INTERIOR 0.63% 0.28% 3.21% 1.3% 0.7% ROOF 0.21% 7.49% 0.43% 0.9% 4.1% FLOOR 0.47% 2.66% 1.71% 1.0% 1.3% REAR 4.43% 0.00% 0.00% 2.8% 0.1% OTHER 0.30% 2.27% 1.32% 0.7% 6.2% NONCONTACT 53.77% 28.61% 19.30% 42.2% 4.4% OROUND 0.06% 0.00% 1.51% 0.4% 2.0% UNKNOWN 19.65% 11.64% 36.91% 23.6% 37.6% ALL 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.0% 100.0% and sustains a rear impact followed by a frontal impact. Type 3 rear impacts are rear impacts that do not fall into either of the other two categories (single vehicle impacts into fixed objects, etc.). The Harm associated with occupant contacts with the rear compartment is not a significant portion of the total Harm to unrestrained, front-seat occupants in rear impacts. The NASS category "rear" (referring to contact with rear interior vehicle structures) makes up less than 3 percent of the total Harm in all rear impacts. It is overwhelmed in importance by "non-contact" Harm and is less than one-fourth of the Harm attributed to the frontal structures of the occupant compartment. Non-contact injury is assumed to be predominately "whiplash" type neck trauma. Considering the total Harm attributed to the seat back structure (namely, the "seat back," "head restraint," and "non-contact" categories), it is apparent that these sources combined have about 15 times more significance than occupant impacts with rear structures. Figure 3 (based on the Data Link study) summarizes the Harm associated with ejection for rear impacts. It can be seen that ejections are not a particularly significant problem in rear impacts. In October of 1990, investigators at Peugot/Renault, working together with two medical doctors, presented data on injuries sustained by restrained motor vehicle occupants in France [Foret-Bruno, 1990]. They found that rear impacts accounted for about 1 0 percent of all injuries, but only 4 percent of severe injuries and fatalities. Looking at 153 occupants involved in single-impact rear HOT EJECTED 1 FIGURE 3: DISTRIBUTION OF HARM TO UNRESTRAINED, FRONT SEAT OCCUPANTS IN REAR IMPACTS AS A FUNCTION OF EJECTION [From Table 12, Data Unk 1990] collisions, the most dominant injury category was injury to the cervical spine area (40 cases). All but 2 of these injuries were minor (AIS 1). In fact, looking at 3,781 restrained front-seat occupants in all types of collisions, only 3 cases of very severe cervical lesion (paraplegia) were found, prompting the authors to conclude that these incidents are "extremely rare". 2022</page><page sequence="5">These French investigators recognized that many factors are involved in rear impact injury potential, including the presence of a head restraint, the resistance of the seat back, the impact severity, the gender of the occupant, and the position of the head relative to the head restraint at impact. They concluded that "seat deformation seems more efficient than the head restraint in reducing neck pain," even though it may allow minor head impacts. The primary focus in evaluating rear impact field accident data has been on front seat occupants. The potential for serious injury to rear seat occupants in rear impacts should also be considered in evaluating the performance of yielding seat backs, because of possible contact as the seat back rotates rearward. NASS data from 1982-1987 contain 876 rear seat occupants in rear- impacted vehicles (about 15 percent of the occupants involved in rear impacts). Table 5 Indicates that there were 25 serious injuries (AIS 3 or greater) to rear occupants, but only 2 (8%) can be attributed to contact with the front seat back or head restraint. Both of these TABLE 5: DISTRIBUTION OF SEVERE INJURIES TO 876 REAR SEAT OCCUPANTS IN REAR IMPACTS, 1982-1987 NASS INJURY SOURCE A,S ALL A1 . SEATBACK OR ALL A1 HEAD RESTRAINT 3 15 2 4 4 0 5 1 0 6 5 0 TOTAL 25 2 injuries were AIS 3 femur fractures. The risk of a serious injury to a rear seat occupant in a rear impact from the yielding seat back or head restraint is thus estimated to be very small. One significant measure designed to reduce the frequency of rear impacts is the center high-mounted stop lamp (CHMSL), which is required on all passenger cars after model year 1986. The early studies evaluating CHMSL demonstrated a reduction as high as 50 percent in the number of rear impacts [Malone, 1978]. While CHMSL will probably be more effective in reducing vehicle damage type rear collisions, it should also have a significant effect of reducing the injury exposure in many car-to-car rear impacts. SEAT BELT EFFECTIVENESS IN REAR IMPACT The effectiveness of seat belts in providing front seat occupant protection in rear impacts was addressed in 1987 [Strother, 1987]. The following four potential benefits were attributed to seat belts in a rear impact situation: (1) the belt may control or eliminate the phenomenon of ramping up the seat back, (2) the belt may reduce the velocity of the occupant relative to the vehicle interior and thus reduce injuries resulting from occupant contacts, (3) the belt may minimize the potential for occupants to be out of position at impact, and (4) the belt may be effective in controlling forward rebound of the occupant. The only field accident study available estimated that seat belts reduced the incidence of any injury in rear impacts by 12 percent and the incidence of serious injury by over 57 percent [Levine, 1972], It was also noted that rear-impact crash tests, done for FMVSS 301 compliance and New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) evaluations, with belted and unbelted dummy occupants showed that the lap belt stayed on the pelvis of dummy occupants and had the effect of limiting their excursion off the seat back. Claims have been made that seat belts do not provide protection in rear-end crashes because they tend to loosen as the seat deforms rearward, allowing the occupant to slide out from under the belt [Rake, 1990; Saczalski, 1989]. While this is undoubtedly possible in rare cases (i.e., multiple impacts, Improper belt use etc.,) field accident data and laboratory tests show that the belt does offer occupant restraint in rear impacts. Rear-end crash tests with restrained dummies characteristically demonstrate the restraining effect of lap belts, notwithstanding seat back yield. Two instances which allowed direct comparison of belt effectiveness in 35 mph Moving Rigid Barrier (MRB) NCAP crashes of Honda and Volvo automobiles, were described in our earlier paper [Strother, 1987]. These two tests involved both a belted and an unbelted front seat occupant and, in both instances, the lap belt was observed to affect the dummy trajectory. It has been asserted that dummies give unrealistic results with respect to lap belt effectiveness, because the Part 572 dummy pelvis structure includes a rubber "flesh" molded into the seated position which causes the dummy's legs to unrealistically rotate up and catch on the lap belt as the dummy moves rearward. While it is clear that the dummy's legs do rotate up, this motion is expected based on the geometry of the seated occupant, irrespective of the dummy hip structure. In most passenger cars, the center of mass of the upper leg is normally above the H-point (Figure 4). In a rear impact, l^^Moment TT T ļ Upper Leg | Moment K-pt ' Seat Folrce Back j ' Folrce ^ CG o f ' V ► U7 i Upper Leg ' ' ' H~Pt ' J FIGURE 4: UPPER LEG FORCE DIAGRAM therefore, the leg will tend to rotate upward due to impact forces, irrespective of the hip joint torque. This motion discourages the lap belt from slipping down the legs of the occupant, producing downward components on the hip. This phenomenon has been observed with cadaver subjects in rear impact sled test simulations (16 mile-per- hour delta-V) [Hu, 1977], Six tests were available for analysis. Targets at the various occupant joints were used to document occupant motion (see Table 6). In general, the test results indicate an increase in upper leg angulation and a decrease in the angle between the torso and the femur as the impact progresses. It should be noted that the occupants' seated posture in these tests were not particularly realistic for passenger cars. Generally the seated position of the cadaver subjects was significantly more erect than would be expected in today's low profile passenger vehicles. For example, in Test C3R, the cadaver subject's upper legs were actually at a nega- tive angle (i.e. the knee joints were below the H-point) at 2023</page><page sequence="6">TABLE 6: CADAVER SLED TEST RESULTS [Hu 1977] y INITIAL POST- IMPACT INITIAL POST- IMPACT NO^ SEX y ('li &lt;-,DS' řMb.1 TORSO/LEG TORSO/LEG LEG LEG řMb.1 &lt;-,DS' ANGLE (deg) angle 2(deg) angles(deg) angle 2«»(deg) C1D 6 4M 70 126 94.0 91.0 +13.8 +22. 0 (6738) C2D 60M 69 134 89.0 105.0 +4.0 +9.5 (6740) C3R 52F 64 132 115.0 99.0 -1.0 -6.0 (6766) C4,R 6 4M 69 159 96.0 83.0 +10.5 +19.5 (6769) C5D 57M 72 195 90.0 120.0 +13.3 +8.0 (6772) C6R 61 M 71 165 NO DATA NO DATA NO DATA NO DATA (6773) I ļ NOTES 1 .

This was the only test where the upper leg was observed at a negative angle after impact. Also, the tibia was nearly vertical in a number of the tests, which had the effect of allowing the ankle area to slide into contact with the seat structure during the impact phase. This ankle/seat contact would discourage any increase in upper leg angle. Even with all of these factors, however, there was no observed tendency for the lap belt to slip down the legs of the test subjects. The MVMA 2-Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator program [Bowman, 1985] was employed to investigate occupant kinematics during rear impact of a belted occupant with a more reasonable seated position. The kinematics of Test 6769 [Hu, 1977] were first duplicated using the model. This test was chosen because the subject approximated the dimensions and weight of a fiftieth percentile male. The occupant parameter data set for a standard Hybrid III 50th percentile male, was used as established by University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). The seat geometry and pre- impact occupant positioning were taken from the high speed film. The seat back angle was approximately 7 degrees back from vertical. Figure 5 shows the upper leg rotation for both the cadaver test and the MVMA 2D simulation and Figure 6 shows the hip joint displacement. The agreement between the sled test and the simulation was judged to be quite good, leading to two findings: (1) 2° i ļ N - - g» © © ņr 2 18 - / / ? / / ^ / / Ü16- CD / // / / CD / / &lt; / / O14" © / // / © / / _l / // Q. 12 " , &lt;V -CD- Cadaver (C4R 6769) " MVMA 2D 10 L- 1 1 0 50 100 150 Time (msec) FIGURE 5: UPPER LEG ROTATION the impact forces do cause the leg to rotate up and catch the lap belt and (2) the joint stiffness for the Hybrid III dummy is an adequate representation of human cadavers for this purpose. Additional simulations were made with a geometry more representative of typical passenger car production seats. Figure 7 shows a comparison of sled test geometry with a more typical seated geometry. The initial position of the upper leg varied between approximately 10 and 20 degrees from horizontal, and the seat back angle was changed to both 20 and 25 degrees.

In summary, the beneficial effect of lap belts, observed earlier in crash tests with anthropomorphic dummies, has been shown to be mainly the result of crash dynamics rather than an artifact of dummy construction. FIELD ACCIDENT DATA ON EFFECTIVENESS OF SEAT BELTS IN REAR IMPACTS Several recent field accident studies have been conducted which address the issue of seat belt effectiveness in rear impacts since 1987. Partyka evaluated the effectiveness of front seat 3-point belt systems for various impact modes using a matched-pair analysis of the 1987 FARS data [Partyka, 1988]. The effectiveness in terms of fatality prevention in rear impacted passenger cars was found to be 32%. The Data Link study discussed previously [Data Link, 1990], evaluated the effectiveness of seat belts in rear impacts in terms of Harm. They found an overall seat belt effectiveness in rear impacts of 37 percent (see Table 7). In chain-type rear impacts, where the subject car experiences a subsequent frontal impact into another vehicle, the Harm reduction seat belt effectiveness is 62 percent, suggesting that the shoulder harness is also effective in reducing injuries caused by subsequent frontal impacts. Evans evaluated the 1975-1983 FARS data to determine the effectiveness of belts in various directions of impact [Evans, 1991]. He found a belt effectiveness in rear impacts of about 47%. Partyka reviewed the NASS data to compare the incidence of injury to the chest, head and face experienced by belted drivers to that experienced by unbelted drivers in rear impacts [Partyka, 1990]. She found that the belted drivers had 41% fewer such injuries than the unbelted drivers. In summary, this review of accident statistical studies indicates that seat belt effectiveness in rear impacts is in the range of 37-47 percent. 2025</page><page sequence="8">TABLE 7: SAFETY BELT EFFECTIVENESS IN REAR IMPACTS FOR FRONT SEATING POSITIONS [From Table 11.

These newer studies provide additional insights into the relative importance of different injury mechanisms for occupants who are injured in rear collisions. Data on the distribution of Harm in rear impacts show the relative insignificance of occupant contacts in the rear compartment area and occupant ejection, compared to the more important "non-contact" and seat-induced Harm. Such data indicate that stiffening front seat backs in an effort to reduce rear-compartment contact and ejection injuries would provide very little, if any safety benefits, and may cause additional non-contact neck injury. The field accident data show: (1) rear impacts do not account for a significant portion of automobile injuries, (2) current production seat backs, provide a high level of protection in rear impacts, and (3) the injury mechanisms which may be addressed by rigid seats make up a minuscule proportion of rear impact injuries. These field accident studies also provide additional information on the effectiveness of seat belts in rear impacts. Reductions in Societal Harm or injury production of 37-47 percent are indicated. The mechanism by which lap belts benefit occupants of vehicles struck in the rear indicates that the lap belt does remain in position on the pelvis, limiting upward and backward excursion.
