<plain_text><page sequence="1">David Ciccoricco Focalization and Digital Fiction "Focalization," perhaps one of the sexiest concepts to surface from narratology's lex icon, still garners considerable attention nearly four decades after its coinage. The entry for the term in the online Living Handbook of Narratology is by far the most popular one, roughly 400 page views ahead of the second most popular, for "author."1 Granted, that statistic may be more a function of the term's inherent confusion than its inherent appeal, as classical narratology has spawned multiple models with ir reconcilable differences and single terms with multiple meanings, all in the service of elaborating Gérard Genettes foundational distinction that the agent who tells the narrative is not necessarily the same one who perceives it. In his contribution to the recent collection Point of View, Perspective, and Focalization, Uri Margolin outlines three directions for a revision of focalization theory: 1) expansion of its application to other media with theoretical modifications as needed; 2) reconfiguration of the available system and its categories; and 3) a reconceptualization of the whole theory by placing it within a more fundamental theoretical framework (41). A general term that Genette endowed with technical meaning in narrative theo ry's structuralist prime, focalization is generally understood to involve the filtering of narrative information with varying degrees of subjectivity via any number of vantage points of characters and narrators.2 Given observations that it is, in a broader sense, "one component of a general theory of fictional minds, that is, of the literary repre sentation of mental activity in all its varieties" (Margolin 45) and "is best understood as a reflex of the mind ... conceptualizing scenes within storyworlds" (Herman 122), models and concepts derived from a cognitivist framework hold tremendous promise David Ciccoricco is a member of the English Department faculty at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. His research is focused on contemporary narrative fiction, with a particular emphasis on emergent forms of digital literature. He is the author of Reading Network Fiction, a book on narrative theory and digital fiction.

In my own deploy ment of the term, then, I aim to draw on cognitivist narrative theories with regard to reconfigurations and reconceptualizations of existing models. But it is primarily that first task, the expansion of focalization theory to other media—namely multimod al computer-based narratives known as digital fiction—to which the present article aims to contribute. Digital fiction is fiction written for and read on a computer screen that pursues its verbal, discursive, and/or conceptual complexity through the digital medium, and would lose something of its aesthetic and semiotic function if it were removed from that medium (Bell et.al.). As such, it draws productively on ideas from literary theo ry and narrative theory (ideas arising out of their concern with primarily language driven texts that typically employ narrators who tell of fictional worlds); semiotics and film studies (focused on texts that employ both sound and images, which range from non-representational to photorealistic and provide varied and variable perspec tives on those images); and game studies (focused on texts that often require ludic participation or simply some form of navigation to achieve certain objectives, even when the objective is to continue reading). At the same time, digital fiction fits com fortably in none of these critical frameworks, the sum of its (moving) parts troubling an exclusive application of any one of them. It thus poses a challenging test case for a transmedial application of focalization theory. Print-based theories of focalization require expansion in order to account for the qualities of literary texts in digital environments. These qualities are namely the mul timodality of digital fiction (which is of course not unique to it)3 and its cybernetics— that is, the recursive, algorithmically orchestrated relationship between reader and machine involving loops of human input and computer output (a feature that is cer tainly unique to the form). To better account for these qualities, I will deploy the con cept of "cybernetic narration," which I develop from Seymour Chatmans "cinematic narration," along with that of "point of action," which is derived from game studies. My analysis will include two Web-based digital fictions, "The Lair of the Marrow Monkey" by Erik Loyer and "The Last Day of Betty Nkomo" by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries. Both texts, as I'll argue, demonstrate how digital fiction animates focalization in ways that significantly influence our understanding and interpretation of the narrative. Points, Views, and Polemic A necessary first step in contextualizing my contribution and establishing the cur rent critical climate is a review of the extant debates about focalization concerning print narrative. A retrospective glance at focalization theory, while not intended to resolve longstanding issues, will also serve to highlight those approaches most rel evant to reading digital fiction. In broad terms, much of the confusion with the no tion of focalization in post-Genettean literary criticism arises from the relative degree to which some of the shorthand distillations of the theory can or should be under stood metaphorically If the still common division of "who speaks?" and "who sees?"</page><page sequence="3">Focalization and Digital Fiction 257 is too vision oriented, the substitution, "who perceives?"—endorsed by Genette in his Narrative Discourse Revisited—does not do justice to conception, as in "who con ceives?" or "who thinks?" But even the original shorthand for "who sees?" can refer to a restriction of narrative information with respect to one's own individual, private mental activity, Manfred Jahn suggests as much when he comments that "[percep tion, thought, recollection, and knowledge are often considered criterial features of focalization, and all these mental processes are closely related to seeing, albeit only metonymically or metaphorically" ("Windows" 243). Genettes original model draws on dual paradigms of knowledge (who knows what relative to whom), which he inherits from Tzvetan Todorov, and vision, which he inherits from the Anglo-American approach dominated by the visual metaphor of point-of-view.4 Thus, permitting a metonymic and metaphorical reading of "seeing" takes us full circle with regard to the quarrel over the concept s limited focus. Further more, whenever a human subject (Active or not) is focalizing another human subject outwardly, which is to say making that subject a perceptible object, he or she is still constructing a model of their subjectivity in the mode of theory of mind—what Alan Palmer has described as "third-person ascription" (Fictional Minds). Thus, "seeing" in these terms already tends to exceed the perceptible in the simply outward, surface, or "external" sense when it comes to focalizing other human subjects. Scholars have of course located other, more intractable issues with focalization. Among the most persuasive and enduring interventions, Mieke Bal has critiqued Genettes triad of zero, internal, and external focalization, noting that both zero and internal focalization, at least from the point-of-view paradigm, refer to focalizing subjects, whereas external focalization—akin to the external reportage of behaviorist narrative—refers to objects focalized. Furthermore, given her stance that focalization is an inevitable rather than an optional element of narrative—for "whenever events are presented, they are always presented from within a certain 'vision" (Narratology 142)—Bal has taken issue with the idea of zero focalization in principle. Her model drops Genettes zero focalization and maintains a dual distinction between internal, or character-bound focalizers, and external narrator-focalizers, thereby keeping the latter term but redefining it. Bal's pairing of internal and external is most commonly adopted in typological analyses, likely for its intuitive division along intra- and extra diegetic lines. But the more Bal's model expands, the more vulnerable it becomes. For example, her notion of focalizers and focalized and its attendant system of notation carries a heavy analytical overhead and has not met wide approval; a typology of focalized objects is probably surplus to economical applications of the theory given that the objects of focalization can vary across all of the subject types, and there is no real way to disassociate the two domains nor is there any compelling reason to do so. Jahn, moreover, disarticulates Bal's proposal of a system of "embedded focalization." He explains how it relies on an analogy of embedded narrative levels, which can be dis tinguished by primary and secondary narrators (and so on) at corresponding diegetic levels ("Windows" 260-62). Contrary to Bal's examples, Jahn notes that it is clearly not enough for the narrator to write that one character sees another character see some object; rather, "embedded focalization is only plausible if it includes a narrato</page><page sequence="4">258 David Ciccoricco rial level, that is, if a narrator (Bal's external or 'first' focalizer) sees that a character sees something" (261). Nevertheless, Bal's recognition of the crucial difference be tween perception and conception, along with her early foray into "visual narratology" (162-70), marks substantial gains for focalization theory that help pave the way for nuanced readings of multimodal texts. More recently, there have been several significant developments in scholarship on focalization that are relevant to the application of the concept to digital fiction. Combining insights from cognitive scientific and popular understandings of our own visual field with Henry James's pre-narratological metaphor of a "house of fiction," Jahn introduces a compelling model based on "windows of focalization" ("Windows," "More Aspects"). He manages to reconcile traditional point-of-view concepts with the key insights of Genette and Franz Stanzel by plotting their possibilities along a sliding scale of focalization that moves from "zero" and "weak" (which are the neg ligible cases) to "ambient" and "strict" (the most common cases). Strict focalizations involve homodiegetic or figural narration, in which there is a clear spatio-tempo ral restriction and deictic anchoring, whereas in zero focalization there is neither an origo (vantage point) nor a locatable object in a perceptual field—which may itself not be demonstrably present. Jahn provides several examples of passages that illus trate these cases along with other patterns of shifting or overlapping focalizations at the micro-level of the discourse, thus echoing Bal's departure from a top-down taxonomy in order to emphasize the potential for more localized variability. His ap proach also shares Bal's insistence on focalization as an essential feature of narrative texts, a foundational process involving the depiction and orientation of fictive agents and events rather than a secondary or subsidiary filter. Moreover, by incorporating a discussion of Marie-Laure Ryan's transmedial "storyline" windows ("On the Window Structure"),5 Jahn encourages various extrapolations of the figure of the window, in cluding that of the active windows of digital interfaces and the computer screen as a kind of window in itself.6 David Herman similarly puts forth a comprehensive rethinking of focalization based predominantly on a text's cognitive grammatical cues. He supports "moving from talk of focalization to conceptualization" and making acts of construal of repre sented situations a primary target of analysis (121); in this view, "construal becomes the common root of voice and vision" (123) ? The move also privileges a functionalist approach as opposed to a taxonomical one, which involves an understanding of per spective primarily as a "sense-making strategy" (123). Working from the assumption that the operations identified in cognitive-linguistic scenarios at the level of clause and sentence can be mapped onto discourse-level structures in narrative texts (129), Herman provides a detailed inventory of parameters toward this end. While his read ings (from James Joyce's Dubliners) begin with familiar points of critical orientation with regard to narrative situation and speech-category, he moves beyond classical accounts by recruiting vocabulary capable of illustrating more complete storyworld construals: static (or synoptic) versus dynamic (or sequential) scanning; wide versus narrow scope; horizontal versus vertical orientation; and scenes sighted from a distal, medial, or proximal vantage point and with varying degrees of detail (granularity) (130).</page><page sequence="5">Focalization and Digital Fiction 259 Both Jahn's and Herman's post-classical narratological approaches hold promise for digital fiction in signaling an intent to expand the critical corpus beyond print textuality or monomodal narratives. Whereas Jahns model has implications for mul timodal, media-rich narratives, Herman's involves a direct application. Specifically, Herman describes the interplay of semiotic channels (text and image) in a Daniel Clowes graphic novel by using the same logic of cognitive construal. What the ap proaches also have in common is a desire to abandon not the key insights afforded by focalization itself but rather the strict binary between telling and seeing, or as Her man's title suggests, a movement "beyond voice and vision." Toward that end, Jahn and Herman adopt graded scales that can prove more useful than typologies in deal ing not only with special cases that confound any typology but also with the micro structural shifts at the level of sentences or even within them. In explicitly drawing on or grounding their models in cognitive repertoires, moreover, both Jahn and Herman address what has been perhaps the outstanding under-theorized aspect of focalization. As Palmer notes, focalization was "envisaged primarily for, and works very well for, one aspect of mental functioning—perception" but not necessarily other aspects of consciousness (49). I would add that the proj ect has particular relevance for literary narratives in digital environments. Indeed, if Palmer is correct in asserting that "in essence, narrative is the description of fictional mental functioning" (12), then digital fiction marks a heightened aesthetic preoc cupation with representations of consciousness given the at-once exhilarating and terrifying communion of humans and machines that characterizes our digital culture. Focalization in the Digital Field If earlier models were restricted by a focus on "seeing" in a visual sense, a model of focalization appropriate for digital fiction, ironically, would need to be more invested in visual qualities, albeit in a different vein. Digital fictions rely on dynamic graphical interfaces containing navigational regimes and require input devices to manipulate them. The reader's attention is therefore focused in ways that are both qualitatively and quantitatively different when compared to print fiction—and, for that matter, other storytelling media.8 That is not to suggest, however, that such manipulations can effectively become acts of focalization, or that readers become focalizers. Rather, I will argue that the affordances of digital fiction can influence the activity of the reader as an interpreter of focalization in a way that the affordances of print narrative cannot. It is productive to first make some general observations, then, about the role of the interface and the consequences it has for our experience of narrative fiction. One challenge for understanding focalization in digital fiction resides in the fact that we are constantly afforded added views of the text through the window(s) of the inter face. To best encapsulate the space of the interface in a holistic sense, narrative theory can benefit from what theorists of information science and digital textuality describe as the text's "architectonic space" (Kaplan and Moulthrop).9 While an equation such as "text" plus "narration" equals "story" (Rimmon-Kenan) may suffice for print me dia, the equation becomes inevitably more layered for dynamic multimodal digital</page><page sequence="6">260 David Ciccoricco texts executed by code. Because the structural integrity of digital fiction, and of digi tal texts in general, is not self-evident (as it is with books), their architectonic spaces must in some way provide a representation of textual structure—in short, some kind of directions for use. Digital fictions, moreover, as aesthetic artifacts, tend to incorpo rate design elements into even minimalist presentations of their narratives; because digital fictions are programmable artifacts that both require clear instructions for their mark-up and collapse text and image into the same materiality of bits onscreen, one could argue that this practice of incorporation is inevitable. In multimodal digital fictions, the domain of interface design can permeate that of the diegesis. Another challenge for readers of digital fiction, then, is deciding when, where, and how we choose to allow aspects of the interface design not simply to in tensify or provide some (ironic) comment on the diegesis but rather to augment or even—in situations where an audial or visual channel subordinates that of the textual discourse—deliver it. The task is further complicated whenever architectonic space affords global views of textual structure (as in the directed graphs of node-link-node narratives composed in the Storyspace hypertext authoring software). After all, ar chitectonic space can represent diegetic material and textual structure at once. For example, in Geoff Ryman's 253: a Novel for the Internet about London Underground in Seven Cars and a Crash, the transportation system metaphor providing the text's thematic motivation also provides the organizing principle for navigating it locally and viewing it globally by way of its train car schematics. Shelley Jackson's Patchwork Girl offers another example in which "mappings" of narrative structure and discourse are conspicuously codependent: readers take on various metadiegetic roles, includ ing piecing together the titular character using body part images, each paired with its own biographical backstory, and elsewhere they "assemble" a patchwork quilt/text using the colorful patchwork of color-coded nodes in the interface. In these cases, it becomes clear that while the form requires conceptualization, its conceptualization also to some degree creates the form. As Kaplan and Moulthrop explain, the architectonic space of the digital text de notes the entirety of the graphical display—the available space of the screen. It can both imitate physical space and map the topological structure of networked texts, but it ultimately does so within the Euclidean confines of its two-dimensional plane. This space is paradoxically stable and dynamic; that is, it entails an architecture of stable objects that users manipulate according to "the rules of geometry and perspective" (Kaplan and Moulthrop 207).10 Thus, it is a rich palette for perspectives that entail elements of textual structure, formal design, and referential storyworld. However pronounced the role of architectonic space in shaping views of the fic tional world, it is necessary to maintain a distinction between the text's discursive and material elements. Thus, when Jahn suggests that "the notion of overlapping windows is easily naturalized within [Ryan's] computer screen analogy" ("More Aspects" 101), we still need to avoid the kind of conflations that plagued the rhetoric of early hyper text theory and dissolved a discursive or linguistic complexity universal to language into the material complexity peculiar to the digital medium. With regard to localiza tion, then, shifting windows at the architectonic level can, but do not necessarily, sig nal shifting windows at the level of the discourse.</page><page sequence="7">Focalization and Digital Fiction 261 An understanding of "nodes" as the fundamental units of digital textuality un derscores this distinction. The node can be considered as a new bibliographical unit peculiar to digital environments, much like a chapter, a footnote, or a stanza. Nodes differ from pages in that page breaks are arbitrary, whereas node-breaks are orches trated or composed as nodes. Pages are also numbered, whereas nodes are individu ally titled. In terms of focalization, given that nodes represent discrete semantic en tities and can act as individual windows in the architectonic space of the text, they are ideal frames for discrete focalizations in themselves. The breaks between them— which, of course, are also paradoxically connections via hyperlinks—allow for the added opportunity to represent breaks (or leaps) of consciousness, or multiple takes on a setting. Focalization in digital fiction that employs the mechanism of shifting nodes is comparable to focal shifts in print (from, say, chapter to chapter) and cinema (from shot to shot), yet it is qualitatively different from both. In fact, experientially, the effect of shifting perspectives from one node to the next is analogous to standing outside of and looking into a "house of fiction" with not a million windows but just one; it repeatedly closes, only to reopen and somehow present not only different occupants but also different furniture and wallpaper, as if everything has been removed and replaced in an instant. Compared to print narratives, looking at the text within each node would afford the same potential for shifts at the paragraph and sentence level. But other comparisons do not carry over as cleanly. For example, as Jahn writes, "In a worst-case scenario, it may be impossible to determine a text's type of internal focal ization until the last page (fixed-internal so far); on the other hand, it may be possible to determine the focalization from page one (for example, variable-internal)" ("Win dows" 250). In a digital fiction, these scenarios do not apply not just for the obvious fact that there are no pages per se, but also because in the case of (multi-linear) texts with variable presentation of the discourse, we do not know when or, in some texts, even if we will encounter the cues that guide us toward these critical determinations. In Stuart Moulthrop's Victory Garden, for instance, readers are aware that there are several metadiegetic interpolations (such as news bulletins or dream and alter nate reality sequences); and we learn that in some cases the same node is focalized internally by more than one character depending on the context—that is, the chang ing semantic neighborhood of nodes that precede and follow it. But we only discover that the dominant narrative voice is internally focalized by the unnamed lover of one of the main characters, Professor Thea Agnew, if we encounter the particular nodes in which his relationship to the story, and Thea for that matter, is revealed (see Selig 657-58). The discovery of a subjective filtering for the majority of the narration has obvious implications for how readers form their own judgments of the characters, potentially in a most retrospective and revisionist manner. Print texts, too, most certainly have their own architectonic space, and Johanna Drucker reminds us that we read for "navigational" cues by force of habit even in the most traditional and austere examples of print textuality. Such cues might be, for in stance, the positioning of illustrations relative to story events, or even the volumetric indication of how many more pages are left to resolve the narrative tensions before us ("Graphic Devices"). But the material trappings of digital textuality place added de</page><page sequence="8">262 David Ciccoricco mands on the reader both in terms of operating the text and processing the semiotic outcomes of that operation. The operation of the text, in basic terms, involves human input and machinic output. Whereas Seymour Chatman speaks of how viewers pro cess the various semiotic channels of film narratives, in digital fictions we must aug ment what we see and what we hear with what we do and what the text does in turn. Or, more specifically, if focalization is "a matter of providing and managing windows into the narrative world, and of regulating (guiding, manipulating) readerly imagi nary perception" (Jahn, "More Aspects" 95), then digital fiction requires that we con sider the reader s role in manipulating the windows of digital textuality and the signif icance of these interventions for the perspectives framed by the narrative discourse. Game studies scholars, adopting narratological conventions that apply to the spatial perspectives camera position affords on a fictional world, have proposed the notion of "point of action" to codify the position from which action can be taken in the interface and the manner in which it is taken (Thon). The principle of "point of action" clearly applies to digital fiction, with the caveat that our action is not typically mediated by an onscreen avatar.11 Like videogames, however, a representation of the user is still manifest. Indeed, the mouse pointer is in effect a literal, analog representa tion of the reader s movement in the text. As Thierry Bardini writes, this translation introduces "a direct connection between the topographical space of the interface and the human gesture of the user" ("Bridging the Gulfs"). The pointer, then, is always potentially and often literally (during input) a point of view—the point of view for the reader. It thus has a dual function in terms of a transmedial focalization theory: it focuses our attention in the visual field onscreen, but it also serves as an origin for the reader s point of action. Of course, some digital fictions (including one of the test cases to follow) do not require or even allow for the readers input, and despite the popular conceptions of digital fictions as interactive and multi-linear texts, "interactivity" and "multi-lin earity" are by no means qualities essential to the form. All digital fictions, however, involve output, which is to say they rely on machine-executable computer code to convey a narrative via an expression plane. Furthermore, the nature of that expression can be regulated in ways that are quantifiably different compared to reading conven tional narrative fiction in print. Digital fiction, for example, recasts the claim that the act of reading is the "only truly temporal measure available" (Rimmon-Kenan 52), given the presence of other measurable phenomena, which could include anything from the time a transient text remains onscreen to the time it takes for an online work to load before it is actually read. Clearly, any time-constrained outputs occurring in a dynamic interface, whether they affect text, images, or entire nodes, transcend Gen ette's classical conception of text "duration." Nevertheless, with regard to articulating what the text does, extant theories of narrative offer a promising lead. In describing how the varied semiotic channels of cinema coalesce into an act of narration, Chatman refers to a "cinematic narrator," which is the "composite of a large and complex variety of communicating devices" (134). The components of cinematic narration work in concert (or in discord for some ironic or aesthetic effect), and the viewer is ultimately responsible for the syn thesis of these components as a narrator, or—in deference to David Bordwell—as</page><page sequence="9">Focalization and Digital Fiction 263 narration. The notion of a composite of communicating devices is relevant to digital fiction not only in that it accommodates semiotic multiplicity, but also in the quasi mechanistic quality of its agent of transmission. Chatman, after all, refers explicitly to a "non-human agent" (134) and in doing so gestures some way toward N. Katherine Hayles's consideration of narratorial subjectivity in light of "intelligent machines" and digital literatures own challenge to default human or anthropomorphic conceptions of narrative agency ("Narrating Bits"). Thus, to account for the additional recursive exchange between reader and computer in digital fiction, it would be logical to attri bute the operational output of digital narratives to a "cybernetic narrator," or at least to a process of cybernetic narration. Cybernetic narration provides an economical way to coherently integrate the thematic and programmatic design of digital fiction. Some final observations concern the role of the reader in greater detail. At issue is the readers ability to manipulate textual space(s) and the prospect of expanding the theory of focalization to the domain of reception. Does the reader potentially engage in acts of focalization? Jahn gestures toward the very possibility when he writes that "[m]ainstream focalization theory with its ready answers to who speaks? and who sees? largely denies narrators and readers their share as well as their power of imagi nary perception" ("Windows" 258).12 But in the absence of an avatar, a fictional agent whose views we directly and meaningfully control, there is likely little to gain from extrapolating the concept another level up in the order of narrative communication. In digital fictions our "actional perspectives" indeed shape our view of the text, but even in these cases the reader remains an agent of interpretation, not of focalization. A move to regard the reader as an agent of focalization does not expand focalization theory; rather, it reassigns the meaning of the term to denote something other than a formal technique that inheres in any given narrative. That is not to suggest that the reader's interventions in the interface do not have a meaningful effect in terms of the texts rhetorical instrumentation. In fact, after clearing the requisite theoreti cal ground, it is now possible to claim that diegetic perspectives in digital fiction are subject to the powers and constraints of "cybernetic narration" and "points of action." My two examples will serve to illustrate the ways in which these regulations affect and inform the focalizations in the storyworlds of digital fiction. Digital Fiction in Focus Both Erik Loyer's "The Lair of the Marrow Monkey" and Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries's (hereafter YHCHI) "The Last Day of Betty Nkomo" are Web-based digital fictions, both use similar animation software, and both betray a preoccupation with cognition. Loyer's text tells the story of a collective mind experiment centering on "Orionl7," a chronically unemployed music school graduate who is struck by a glori ous synaesthetic vision triggered by a used car dealership commercial. YHCHI's text explores the final thoughts of an isolated and dying woman. The most pronounced formal difference between the two is that Loyer's text requires input both to navigate the text and to mobilize its interactive motion graphics; YHCHI's text, by contrast, runs (or plays, or performs) for several minutes at a predetermined—and at times</page><page sequence="10">264 David Ciccoricco just legible—speed and concludes without requiring or allowing user intervention. For this difference as well as their many similarities, both texts open productive lines of inquiry as test cases for focalization in digital fiction.13 A Window onto the Lair Erik Loyers "The Lair of the Marrow Monkey" offers a lucid demonstration of how the digital medium accommodates focalization effects that could not be staged in the print medium. More specifically, it shows how the act of manipulating a visually rich interface—even when it does not project representational images of a storyworld— can establish metadiegetic perspectives that inform our reading of the narrative dis course at the level of the storyworld. In addition to a discernible homodiegetic narration, "The Lair of the Marrow Monkey" is told in the form of monologues, poems, letters, and even transcribed orientation sing-alongs. The narration shifts in some scenes to the other "marrow monkeys" who are experimental subjects like Orion 17, but all of these elements are encased by the narrative about and narration by him, which begins and ends the text as a whole. In episode two (of nine), Orionl7 recounts his strange motel room vision. The opening lines of that scene are reproduced here as numbered sentences: 1) I couldn't sleep, that night. 2) The air conditioning was out in the motel, and it was a typical southern, summer evening, which meant suffering through a deafening heat. 3) I was far from home, far from rest, and I had nothing better to do but lay there and listen for the droplets of my sweat as they fell on the sheets. The first sentence establishes a reflector character recalling an earlier event, signaled by the deictic marker "that night." Sentences two and three describe subjective sensa tions that are felt (the heat and, presumably, the sweat on his skin) and possibly heard (listening for the sound of the droplets), though the latter may instead be taken as a hyperbolic comment on his boredom. The next three sentences mark a spatio-tem poral shift further back two months, before returning us to the moment of inception of his vision. In between these markers, however, the specific location of this stage of his "journey" is not conveyed beyond vague references to the "topology" of his mind: 4) When I started this journey, two months earlier, I fancied myself on a vi sion quest, exploring the topology of internal states and further spheres. 5) But by that night I had learned nothing, spent everything, and suspected I was soon to die of boredom, stranded in a town nobody had ever heard of, or would ever hear of. 6) Then, it happened. Because Orionl7 is describing his own subjective experience of a past event, his rec ollection already poses some difficulties, given that memory, as Margolin succinctly</page><page sequence="11">Focalization and Digital Fiction 265 puts it, is "an active faculty, not a passive slate" (53). But at this point in the narration, when Orion 17 starts to describe his vision in greater detail, the text troubles conven tional focalization categories even further: 7) A jingle from one of those late-night, low budget car dealership commer cials had been running through my head all night. 8) Now, as it returned for an umpteenththousandsth encore, I suddenly re alized that I was seeing the inane music there in front of me, in patterns that shimmered before my eyes. While some theorists, including Bal and Jahn, embrace a more expansive un derstanding of the contents of focalization that would include dreams, delusions, or hallucinations, others, such as Margolin, do so only if they are recalled as men tal episodes that transpired at some time prior in the storyworld. Orionl7's vision, however, combines a recollection of imperceptible sounds (a jingle he hears in his mind) with reportage of perceptible images in the form of patterns he sees "before his eyes." It is difficult to extricate the images—hallucinatory as they may be—from their soundtrack, so to speak, given that they are part and parcel of the same synaesthetic memory. Nonetheless, the passage for the most part represents an unproblematic instance of what classical narrative theory would call internal focalization, one that would fall at the "strict" end of Jahns scale with a clear and consistent deictic anchor. We might add that, as per Hermans model, while Orion 17 describes his motel expe rience sequentially, with temporal digressions providing further context, the primary object of the construal—his vision—is presented synoptically and proximally, with a degree of granularity that is arguably high, at least for a potential hallucination (he discerns "patterns" and, later, "data"), yet at the same time radically unstable (in its "shimmering"). Nevertheless, the analysis thus far has not taken us outside of the textual channel; we still need to factor in not only the animated images and sound but our own role in their performance. In fact, we can take our own cue from Orionl7's next description: "I found that I had absolute control over every part of the vision. I could focus on any piece of it and make it grow, shift, and reveal still more data as I watched." In this char acteristically reflexive moment of digital-literary aesthetics, we too, as readers, find that we have control over the visual data before us. As we manipulate words and geo metrical shapes, we too find ourselves listening to instrumental music, interminably looping in the background, that is faintly reminiscent of an advertising jingle. More specifically, our role consists of using the mouse to hover over a number of dynamic image-text elements and to integrate them (via the act of pointing and dragging) into a moving circle. A grammatically coherent text displays underneath the image frame in turn. Thus, even though breaking the narrative down into a numbered transcrip tion of sentences would make it appear as if I am engaged in a Barthesian act of divide and conquer, the sentences actually reflect an act of accretion, the result of taking the compiled sentences from our points of action in the individual nodes (there are 15 in total), then joining them with all of the sentences displayed during the entirety of scene two. Indeed, the act of reading inevitably involves an act of semantic accretion</page><page sequence="12">266 David Ciccoricco as we process words into sentences, sentences into propositions, and propositions into narrative coherence. But in digital fictions such as Loyers text, the process occurs only with and through the act of textual accretion at the material level of the interface. Unlike more conventional excerpts taken from print fiction that comprise a smaller sample or selection, my own excerpt is more like an assemblage or even transcription in that it conveys a greater amount of text than is displayed in the interface at any one time. In each node, we start with the letter "i," which adheres, quite appropriately, to the center of the circle, suggesting that Orion 17 cannot escape his own sphere of con scious perception. The first node contains the sentence that also serves as the title for the entire scene, "I couldn't sleep, that night." When we hover over the word "sleep," however, we find that this is one element that we are not able to bring into the circle (its dark font on a dark background makes it difficult even to see). Just as the protago nist is confounded chasing sleep, so too is the reader chasing words on a screen. The visual-textual display and the reader s intervention in it, moreover, become increas ingly more layered, complex, and reflexive as Orion 17s synaesthetic condition grows more intense and he begins to interface with the shimmering data patterns in front of him. Indeed, Orion 17's description of "absolute control over every part of the vi sion"—and Loyers text in general—is a meta-commentary on focalization in par ticipatory media. It questions the extent to which we must read ourselves into the perceptual field of digital fiction or, to invoke the familiar metaphor, the way in which the computer screen acts as both mirror and window. In fact, Loyers image arrays evoke Jahns own schematic diagram of the visual field, which places an object of fo calization in a circumscribed field. In Jahns image, the perimeter is teardrop-shaped with the subject arbitrarily situated to the left-hand side of the field of vision (to com pensate for the two-dimensional nature of the page). But rotate the image so that we are the origo, and we can conceive of a schematic in three dimensions whereby a field of vision is not encircled but rather enframed by the screen and our own focal area contains the "i" of Orionl7's understatedly lowercase subjectivity. Furthermore, this subjectivity inevitably merges with our own, both figuratively reflected and literally represented in the visual field, as we move the mouse pointer directly over it to "mobi lize" this vision. For all the celebrations of choice in hypertext and digital textuality, if we are in fact to read this text, we do not have any choice other than make this move. That is, we must rearrange the geometrical and linguistic shapes before us in order to bring them into (grammatical) focus. Clearly, the dynamic images accomplish more than simply animating a metaphor of chasing sleep. Given their non-representational nature, however, Loyers interac tive motion graphics can be said to evoke but do not enact focalizations of the fic tional world. Rather, they animate metadiegetic perspectives in architectonic space that inform the focalization of the narrative discourse. Once the parallel between the readers and narrator's "vision" is set up, we can make further observations across these levels of narrative communication, comparing, say, the proximity or granularity of what we see to what Orion 17 reports seeing, and we can then consider what sort of added commentary might arise from this relationship in turn.</page><page sequence="13">Focalization and Digital Fiction 267 0RI0N17: "I couldn't sleep, that night" f tha t naght ■ I I couldn't sleep, that night.

Jahns diagram of the visual field ("Windows" 242) All in all, it is difficult to ignore such perspectives in any digital fiction given that our "presence" in the text is continually reinforced by the mouse cursor as analog rep resentation of our "place" therein. But the metadiegetic perspective evoked in Loyer's text takes on even greater significance in light of the strong thematic analogy between the activity of narrator and reader as they both manipulate data streams. As Orion 17 moves seamlessly from a car dealership commercial to what he describes as a "realm of pure, perfect, fluid information," he reveals the apparently fine line between the mundane and the epiphanous, a revelation that might also apply to the experience of life online more generally.</page><page sequence="14">268 David Ciccoricco Streaming Betty Nkomo Much like Loyers text, "The Last Day of Betty Nkomo" by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries shows how the digital environment can shape the form and function of fo calization in literary narratives. But it does so in a rather different fashion: the text is a powerful illustration of how communication in one channel of a multimodal digital fiction can have important consequences for our understanding of communication in another. Both popular and scholarly accounts of YHCHI, an artist collective comprised of Marc Voge and Young-hae Chang, tend to find their Web-based works remark able in their overt disavowal of interactivity and graphics—commonly accepted to be staple features of digital literature. "The Last Day of Betty Nkomo" conforms to the same aesthetic, with black text on white background dominating the presentation of the 150-odd screens that flash by the reader with a ferocity reminiscent of a Jean-Luc Godard film. The entire text runs for no more than a few minutes, leaving the reader few choices outside of: switch off or replay. The short text is commonly categorized as digital poetry, but it is not necessar ily written in verse. There is certainly a regular rhythm of the textual display—not to mention that of the soundtrack—a rhythm that encourages an understanding of YHCHIs text as poetry; and its lyrical repetitions (the construction "I will" appears in nearly half of the sentences) evoke poetic technique. But this understanding is likely an unconscious normalization of the text, as there are no line breaks per se, nothing to cue that this text is written in verse and not prose. The nodal breaks are not neces sarily line breaks, and to read them this way is to neglect something of the texts na tive environment. In reading the text as poetry, we might productively apply Brian McHale's notion of "segmentivity," which he argues can function as poetry's dominant (in Roman Jakobsons sense of the controlling component of a work) in much the same way that "narrativity" functions as narratives dominant and "performativity" fuctions as performances dominant ("Beginning"). In this context we might concep tualize Betty Nkomo as a word-measured poem segmented in nodes, but again, these generic considerations are still only a prelude to the kinetics of the digital text coming into play. Most screens display only one word (at most two) for a fleeting moment before moving on to the next, placing cognitive demands on the very act of reading. The effect is analogous to rapid filmic cuts in a technical sense, as the entirety of the diegetic material framed by the screen is replaced by a new frame, although here we are dealing exclusively with verbal signs. (Readers unfamiliar with the text can view it at: http://www.yhchang.com/BETTY_NKOMO.html before continuing on to the analysis that follows.) The affective weight of the text stems in part from the ability of readers to iden tify with a discernible narrative subject in Betty Nkomo, who is likely ill or elderly, impoverished, alone, and dying. While "Nkomo" is an African name, the soundtrack that plays in tight synchronization with the flashing text is Asian folk music; thus, the extent to which we can place the text in a distinct cultural context remains question able. Nevertheless, a discernible narrative does emerge, as illustrated by the following numbered transcription of the full text:</page><page sequence="15">Focalization and Digital Fiction 269 1) Today it's cool in the shade. 2) My cheek is cool against the dirt. 3) Yes it is! 4) I will lift my head up today, then see if I can sit up. 5) I will lift my head today. 6) I will stretch my arm from the shade and set a hand in the sun. 7) I will look up and out the doorway now at someone passing. 8) Will he come? 9) And if that someone is my son, I will smile. 10) I will lift my cheek from the dirt and set my hand in the sun. 11) I will lift my head today, or maybe tomorrow. 12) Don't believe it! 13) Ha! Ha! Ha! 14) The rats go in, the rats go out. 15) The sun goes up, the sun goes down. 16) The world goes 'round, the The first two sentences establish a homodiegetic narration in the present tense, where the here and now of experiencing and telling merge to form a kind of interior monologue. Betty's own perceptions are limited to tactile sensations of the cool air and dirt. Lines four through eleven are future-oriented, which compounds the pathos of the scene and emphasizes the woman's determined yet futile state. In her own pro jected, imaginary construal of her surroundings, however, we can note her visual field is limited both by her prostrated position and the narrow aperture of the doorway (the absence of a door might be a further indication of her poverty). As an interior monologue, the text would at first appear to represent a case—in classical understandings, the purest case (Genette 193)—of internal focalization. But the text poses other challenges in its ambiguous polyvocality. Bettys own hopeful af firmation in line three ("Yes it is!"), for instance, appears to be undermined in line twelve, turning abruptly to doubt ("Don't believe it!"). The eerie laughter that follows would seem to underscore that doubt to the point of self-mockery, portraying a des perate woman with warring thoughts and emotions. A final tense shift in lines four teen through sixteen has the effect of conveying a continuous present by temporally condensing the entirety of her daily experience, which comprises sunrises, sunsets, and the ingress and egress of rodents.14 At the same time, if the sudden switch to a less emotive, more objective perspective (in the philosophical if not spatio-temporal sense) seems curious, that is because it probably is. Moreover, if these lines sound out of character for Betty Nkomo, it is because they probably are just that. In a different reading, the final thoughts might belong not to Betty, but rather to an authorial voice with an authorial perspective. Granted, as Patrick O'Neill has observed, the more ambiguous the focalization, the greater the scope for interpretation (94), but I would argue that a deeper consid eration of the multimodal qualities of the text—which is also to say the machina tions of cybernetic narration—yields a stronger, more determinate, and indeed rich er interpretation. Genette describes deviations from the dominant mode/mood of</page><page sequence="16">270 David Ciccoricco focalization as "alterations," playing on the dual meaning of "mode" in French, which connotes both grammar and music (193). His invocation of music is significant in that it is precisely the rhythm and musicality of YHCHI's text that guides us in ne gotiating its play of voices and vantage points. Whereas it is common to speak of the aesthetic outcomes of discordance between semiotic channels in multimodal and es pecially filmic texts, "The Last Day of Betty Nkomo" instead exploits the concordant relationship between sound and streaming text. More specifically, vocal syncopations in the soundtrack explicitly accent the same textual moments that mark a potential divergence from Bettys subjectivity—those that read more like (increasingly derisive) comments on her own thoughts. One instance—the only vocals in English, at "Ha! Ha! Ha!"—even amounts to a direct correlation between the voices heard and the text displayed. The alignment of accented vocals with particular textual moments encour ages a reading of narration in counterpoint, whereby the singing voices open another window of focalization that is not explicitly concomitant with the musical voices but certainly evokes an external viewpoint. This reading means that not only the concluding three lines but also several oth ers (namely three, eight, twelve, and thirteen) are handed over to a heterodiegetic or metadiegetic narration, one that is responsible for the text's tone of derision and its ironically dark undercurrent more broadly. In fact, the emotive resonance of the text can be said to further result from a discordance between the soundtrack, which is resolutely hopeful, and the theme of hoping in vain. Even for the last three lines, where no vocalizations are paired with the text (only a dwindling string instrumen tation), the preceding vocal interpolations are enough to establish the presence of an external agent who can see the woman's futility. Notwithstanding the presence of a second narratorial agent, the final three lines of the text remain indeterminate. They also introduce the first disjunction between the soundtrack and the text: more specifically, the music resolves but the discourse does not, breaking mid-sentence with "the." In turn, the ending signals both an allusion to that prototypically Joycean return as well as a return to Betty's subjective viewpoint, breaking also, as it does, in mid-thought.15 Figure 3. Screenshot of the alternating white font from "The Last Day of Betty Nkomo"</page><page sequence="17">Focalization and Digital Fiction 271 Design elements reinforce this counterpoint reading: with one exception (the second half of line six),16 the lines that can be said to shift the point of focus away from the woman and onto her are also those that switch from black font on a white back ground to white font on a black background (again recalling Genettes "alterations" but in a distinctly color-coded sense). In turn, the focalization would slide, on Jahn's scale, from the upper reaches of "strict" toward an "ambient" mode that allows for a communal view of the woman, a view that is anchored temporally by two points in the field but anchored spatially by only one. Thus, it becomes even clearer how shifts in one channel of communication effectively cue our understanding of the shifts in another. It is also necessary to emphasize that the relationship between focalization and voice, which is (following Genette) close in any given narrative text, is perhaps even closer in this digital fiction. Given that the text's orthography is itself subjected to musical and graphical animation, "voice"—the way the narrative is told—opens it self up to how it is seen (displayed) and heard (musically accompanied) by the reader. Both modes inform our understanding of who perceives what in the diegesis. It is only in such a reading, moreover, that the power of focalization to create, at once, an empathetic and ironical view of Betty Nkomo is fully realized. If the musicality of "The Last Day of Betty Nkomo" informs our understanding of the perspectives put forth in the discourse, so too does its speed. Recalling Hermans discussion of cognitive construal, in which he speaks of the varied ways in which fo calizers scan the storyworld, we can suggest that YHCHI's text orchestrates a rapid sequential scanning of the text's architectonic space. The play of "transient text" (Aars eth 63) places overt constraints on our view of the storyworld, if only by temporally regulating our access to it. In fact, the text prompts us to rethink the commonplace notion that digital environments necessarily degrade attention; after all, if we are not extremely focused, we run the risk of missing words or perspectival shifts. Hayles describes how, compared to print texts, the agency of reading itself is distributed dif ferently in YHCHI's works in which the speed "is controlled through a computer algorithm ... [that] involves the rapid processing of code by an intelligent machine" (Electronic Literature 126). Temporality is thus introduced into the space of reading, and rather than our eyes moving across the page, the text moves and our eyes—and our own focal point—remain more or less fixed (125). While it is possible to assert that the same kind of focal shifts in YHCHI's text can be achieved in a print text at the level of the sentence, such an assertion would neglect the essential rhythm of the work, so to speak, and the fact that it is programmed to display text at a certain pace and in certain units. The speed of the text, then, should be understood as a function of cybernetic narration, one that has clear implications for our interpretation of the narrative. For example, if we read the text's transience in the broader context of a reflection of consciousness, Bettys final moments certainly "flash" before our eyes as well as hers. Furthermore, against the pop psychological notion of "time dilation" associated with near death or life threatening situations, her last moments might be said to be curiously fast-forwarded, perhaps marking an in dictment of our own impatience in an information culture that demands immediacy and instantaneity. Either way, any reading should accommodate a thematic alignment between the text's performativity and that of Betty's own experience. In fact, if we</page><page sequence="18">272 David Ciccoricco pursue an even more reflexive reading, the Internet becomes a highly unlikely venue for the "last words" of a dying African woman. And it is, in another sense, also the only possible one. ALL IN ALL, the foregoing analyses demonstrate both the continued relevance of theo ries of focalization for literary texts in digital and programmable media and some of the media-specific theoretical expansions needed to apply the concept in those environments. Several significant questions remain to be explored further across the emergent form(s) of digital fiction. When and on what grounds, for example, can we establish the textual channel as primary? Or, what are some other ways we can codify the readers participatory role in manipulating and creating perspectives in (or of) the text, and how would they—in Jahns words—accord a place for the reader in focalizations framework ("Windows" 263) without atomizing the concept in the process? Nonetheless, I hope I have affirmed that the very questions raised by focal ization theory are certainly worth pursuing for digital fiction and that the cybernetic machinations of the medium have a significant influence on the judgments we ulti mately make about characters and their narrators. In doing so, I also hope to have achieved a further objective with my readings, which is simply illustrating the verbal and conceptual complexity of narrative texts written for the computer screen—in deed, the literary complexity that might otherwise fall in the shadow of digital media's pyrotechnics.

Statistics for the site are available from the Contents page at: http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/index.php/Special: CustomStatistics. 2. With regard to the critical dissent over whether narrators can function as focalizing agents, I fol low those, such as Margolin, who believe there are several situations where it makes perfect sense to accept this possibility (52-53). These would include a narrator, either homodiegetic or hetero diegetic, reporting on his or her here and now, as well as a character-bound narrator reporting on a recollected event in which he or she participated—a scenario in which the "experiencing-I" and the "narrating-I" is the same agent. In his reading of Nabokov's Lolita, James Phelan further justifies the role of narrators as focalizers by illustrating how the distinction between "reporting" and "perceiving" is ultimately untenable (57-58). 3. Silke Horstkotte and Nancy Pedri have recently applied insights of post-classical narratology to questions of focalization in graphic narratives. They emphasize that "focalization is a pivotal concept for a visual or multimodal narratology in so far as it directs meaning and opens up the possibility for variance in meaning and mood" (351). 4. In Narrative Discourse, Genette develops the knowledge paradigm based on an extension of lin guistic principles: a narrative is analogous to a verb in that it can be studied grammatically in terms of "tense," "voice," and "mood." Perspective, for him, is a function of "mood," or the at titudinal orientation of the narrative. In his later Narrative Discourse Revisited, Genette describes focalization as a restriction of both "field" and "narrative information" (74), thus retaining the connotative richness of both paradigms even as he moves to advance the newer notion of "per ception."</page><page sequence="19">Focalization and Digital Fiction 273 5. Ryan's approach draws heavily on metaphors from film and computer media in positing a "narra tive screen" that accommodates dynamic "takes" of a storyworld. The same rhetoric that usefully parses focalization into "takes" is invoked by Margolin and adopted herein as well. 6. Jahn also contributes a comprehensive chapter on focalization in the Cambridge Companion to Narrative in which he stresses the need to differentiate between the real-life perceptions of the "experiencing-I" or what he calls "online perception" and those "imaginary sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches that one perceives in recollection," or what he calls "offline perception" (99). Notwithstanding the validity of his claim, the terms "online" and "offline" potentially introduce an undesirable confusion in the context of digital fiction. 7. I will continue to use the term "focalization" rather than the useful term "conceptualization" even when applying Hermans model to readings of digital fiction because I do not believe that we need to jettison the term, which I think ultimately benefits from its tradition of theoretical commen tary. 8. By "qualitative" I mean differences that cross a given perceptual threshold and have a meaning ful effect on the reception process, whereas "quantitative" differences equate to "media specific" qualities to which digital-literary scholarship has advocated greater critical sensitivity (Hayles, Writing Machines). 9. The term is also useful in that it implies an architect or designer, and potentially one with some new authorial powers. As Drucker has observed, "Looking at an interface and all its endless seeming but seamlessly navigated possibilities creates a sense of omniscience" (134). In fact, the sense of complete artistic control over the design of such architectonic spaces might encourage the decision to employ an analogous narrative viewpoint. For example, David Lodge has de scribed how, in relation to the novel, the philosophical and cultural context of a given historical period contributes to the stylistic choices that shape it. A decision to adopt an omniscient view from-above in digital fiction, then, both by way of global maps of textual structure and hetero diegetic figural narration, might be understood along the same lines. In fact, such exercises in omniscience might even be understood as a tactic to compensate for the inability to cognitively map—in Fredric Jamesons sense—todays postmodernist hyperspaces. There are many examples of digital fictions pairing global views of textual architecture with all-knowing narrators that would support this hypothesis, including Geoff Ryman's 253, which delves into the mind of each one of the 253 passengers on a London Tube (and focalizes the text from each), and Lance Olsens 10:01, which similarly reveals the thoughts and feelings of a movie theater audience in the min utes leading up to the films screening. 10. In contradistinction to "architectonic space" is "semantic space," which denotes the mental model of a text's meaning and is, in this sense, analogous to the "macrostructure" assembled during the act of reading described by cognitive linguistics. Semantic space is not a built structure observable in physical space and can only be approximated with physical "mappings" after-the-fact; it is, as Kaplan and Moulthrop explain, "deeply connected to the production of meaning [and] interpre tation" (207). In short, semantic space helps articulate contexts of reading and reception whereas architectonic space illuminates contexts of composition and design. In its original context, the distinction responds to design problems that arose from reductive understandings of the relation ship between the spatial models on the screen and those in our own minds: "We must understand that the two domains of virtual space, the architectonic space of mapping and the semantic space of conceptual development, do not perfectly correspond... [and] we should aim for systems that harmonize the two as well as possible, but which acknowledge the contingent nature of any such harmony" (215). 11. As Jan-Noel Thon explains, there is a mode of spatial perspective in videogames that is presented "objectively," in which the game space is "presented from a position that is not connected to an avatar" (284-85). Even here, however, the gamer is effectively cast in the role of Creator or some kind of (often military) strategist. Nonetheless, I acknowledge the difficulty inherent in drawing absolute distinctions between texts that are read and games that are played. (See also Ryan, "From</page><page sequence="20">David Ciccoricco Narrative Games to Playable Stories," and Aarseth's distinction of "personal" and "impersonal" texts under the category of "Perspective" in his cybertextual typology [63].) 12. Using Calvin and Hobbes comics as his example text, Patrick O'Neill considers the ways in which focalization "bridges" to extratextual contexts, including functions of the implied author, the im plied reader, and the actual reader (95-106). Elizabeth Nixon argues that reader / viewer focaliza tion is precisely what occurs for indeterminate or unfocalized material, a claim she explores with regard to animated film. It is telling that in both these cases the texts discussed are multimodal ones. 13. The analyses rest on the assumption that typological—and, more broadly, narratological—ap proaches to narrative fiction in any medium work in the service o/cultural, ideological, and ethi cal critique. For closer readings of the authors along these lines see Jessica Pressman ("Reading Code," "Strategy of Digital Modernism") and N. Katherine Hayles's Electronic Literature. 14. In telling once what happens over and over again, it also serves as an example of Genette's iterative mode of narrative frequency. 15. I acknowledge one of the articles reviewers for raising yet another possibility: given that the visual and the audial channels remain here in the form of the graphics and instrumentation, the view point could remain external at this moment with the narrating voice ending at the same moment that Bettys life does, thus providing further ironic commentary on the disconnect between her optimistic vision of the future and her reality. Either way, the absence of vocals here allows for an open-ended reading of these last lines, including the possibility that they form an instance of free indirect discourse or what Palmer (2004) would describe more specifically as free indirect thought. 16. The curious shift from the possessive pronoun "my" to the indefinite article "a" when referring to Bettys hand, however, might provide evidence for yet another shift and explain the anomaly here, as it certainly reflects a move from an embodied perspective to a disembodied or detached one. I credit Steven Holmes, a student attending a paper I delivered at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa in April 2012, with making this observation. Works Cited Aarseth, Espen.
