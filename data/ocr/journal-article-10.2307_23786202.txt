<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH A GUIDELINE FOR THE HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGY? Hans-Liudger Dienel 1. INTRODUCTION In the last decades, the theoretical framework and methodological approach to describing technological change have seldom come from the history of technology. Rather, the pioneers in concepts and catchwords have been largely in the fields of sociology or economics. In this paper I should like to test their suitability for the history of technology. At the end I shall make some suggestions for 'cultural reconstruction' in technology.' Sociologists in science and technology, and technical strategists in economics stand on the edge of their disciplines just as do historians of technology in relation to general history. Together with those historians interested in the theoretical aspect of technology they form a new subculture in technological research.2 The sociology of technology, a younger sister of the sociology of science,3 has long been neglected4 but has now become popular. The more important organisations in sociology and political sciences have recently included discussions on matters of technology research in their annual meetings.5 Industrial sociology, an older discipline, developed into an assessment of the consequences of technology.6 Economists have approached technology and innovation as a production factor. They usually carry out practical analyses of the mechanisms of technological change, with a view to decision-making as a business strategy. The history of technology itself has so far experienced rather a limited methodological discussion although the separation from the history of science and from an internalised history of technology as written by engineers brought up some debate. The American history of technology, which severed its links with the history of science in the late 50s, and has since then dominated the international scene, has been particularly committed to elaborating the independence of technology.7 This position of apologist, which reminds one of the engineers' struggle for recognition as a profession in the 19th</page><page sequence="2">Hans-Liudger Dienel 71 century, has dominated the debate on the difference between science and technology, between the history of science and the history of technology.8 Science historians and theoreticians still have a tendency to regard technology as applied science/ while historians of technology have emphasised that theirs is an independent discipline.10 But however the dividing lines have been drawn between science and technology, whether internal (i.e. methodological) or external via differing social structures, no one has yet succeeded in defining two unambiguously dichotomous fields. Apart from these discussions, a lack of theories is evident, which is why external stimuli have been so important. This reluctance to accept too great a penetration of theory has shown the history of technology to be a well brought-up daughter of general history, which as a profession is committed to the historicist category of individuality. The historical approach consists of producing not theories to explain the world, but methods for interpreting the sources. Historians' aversion to theory (at least in Germany) is a heritage of the founding of history as a 'realist science' in the first half of the 19th century, in opposition to the declining speculative philosophy. The rejection of natural laws of development by the 19th-century patriarch historians has had a lasting effect. Just recently, the 1993 general congress of German historians of technology (at the headquarters of the Institute of German Engineers) took the theoretical model of technological genesis and change as its topic," but critique of sociological models and the search for cultural approaches was en vogue.12 The tradition in America is somewhat different. There, the history of technology generally had close links with the sociology of technology; in many universities they were combined in one department. 2. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE: MODELS FROM SOCIOLOGY AND ECONOMICS Technical genesis and change are the 'single most popular theme' in the academic history of technology." However, historians of technology have derived their most important theoretical tools from elsewhere, from sociologists and economists. Sociological models Thomas Kuhn's thesis, that the development of science proceeds in</page><page sequence="3">72 Sociological and Economic Technology Research an alternation of periods of stability and revolution, itself led to a revolution in the study of science and created the new paradigm of socially constructed science." There is no doubt that Kuhn's defini tions were enormously fruitful for the sociological understanding of technology. The 'social construction of reality' by Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann had an even greater influence on general sociology. Paradigms, said Kuhn in 1962, somehow have an integral character; they bring about a shift in scientific language and fields of research, and they create a change in the feeling of similarity.15 A change of paradigms is normally brought about by a new generation of scientists rebelling against the establishment. Rival theories draw a comparison between scientific change and life cycles, and speak of the ageing of scientific theories. The sociology of science and technology defined science and technology as a social process, a 'social construction', and at the same time extended the term technology to cover social mechanisms. On the other hand, the objective truth of natural laws was irrelevant to the social constructivists.16 The erstwhile central question of who invented new technologies and how, now took second place to the question of how particular technological achievements are accepted as paradigms - second place, that is, to the processes of forming a consensus and coming to an understanding.17 The social constructivists borrowed their methodological ideas from general sociology, and in particular from a line of tradition of the 30s. Ludvik Fleck's Entstehung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache (emergence of a scientific fact) and Gilfillan's Sociology of Invention differ only slightly from many contemporary publications, and are cited abundantly nowadays.18 The 'yellow bible' by Bijker, Hughes, and Pinch, and the collected papers of Mackenzie and Wajcman became part of the standard repertoire of references. Technology historians frequently experience a feeling of nausea - or pangs of conscience - at these approaches. I shall analyse the reasons for these feelings and suggest a 'cultural construction of technology' in the last part of my paper. An analogy to the scientific revolution is the concept of 'technical genesis'. A new consensus of agreement opens a breach in the ruling state of the art, the consolidated pool of comprehensive rules, methods, and building blocks.1' Technical genesis means registering new objectives and stabilising ('toughening') new technological processes.20 This concept presupposes that technology normally tends to adhere to the stable path of development within the ruling technical</page><page sequence="4">Hans-Liudger Dienel 73 paradigm. The complementary division into radical and conservative inventions is clearly derived from the Kuhnian structure of scientific revolution. Even within the ruling technical paradigm there is technological progress, albeit conservative. All innovations based on analogy are conservative ones. These models place too much emphasis on the early phase in the birth of new technologies, declaring it to be the most significant phase. Once consolidated, so the theory goes, accepted technical principles can only be ousted by a new revolution. The toughening process can be explained either primarily by the consensus of agreement among the 'actor networks'21 or else more by the intrinsic impulse of technological systems and machinery. Dierkes and Knie favour an organo sociological explanation for the way new technologies establish themselves in the market to the exclusion of possible competitors. With his model of 'technological momentum', Thomas Hughes describes both the dynamic inertia of large-scale technological systems and also the mentality of the managers and development engineers involved.22 He also introduced the concept of the 'system' to describe the intrinsic momentum of technology and technical peo ple, the urge for networking, toward complexity, growth, rationalisation and self-checking. This impulse characterises not only technology and those who work in it, but these days the entire modern society.23 Conservative inventions, says Hughes, stabilise the system by improving system components whose development has not kept pace (what he calls 'reverse salients'). Industrial research as carried out by departments of large companies since the turn of the century is concerned first and foremost with ironing out these reverse salients; radical inventions still come from the independent inventors.24 The term 'presumptive anomaly', proposed by the technology historian Edward Constant, is also committed to the dialectic of conservative versus revolutionary inventions, with equal fixation on the early phase. It describes the existence of an invention which can be theoretically formulated but not yet technically implemented, and which either presupposes or creates a new technological system. This 'what if?' mental game, he says, is the necessary precursor of all technological revolution.25 The mistake of overemphasising the genesis phase is avoided by evolutionary models. Basing their terminology on biology, they describe the growth, ageing, and death of technologies, thus giving us a view of the entire 'life' of a technological development. Bijker and Pinch, for example, describe technological development as 'an</page><page sequence="5">74 Sociological and Economic Technology Research alternation of variation and selection'.26 The evolutionists frequently substitute the term innovation quite generally for that of invention. Walter Vincenti describes the engineers' research and development activities as 'parameter variation', the deliberate altering of individual parameters in an experiment, by analogy with nature's process of trial and error (as propounded by Darwin). In his recent book What Engineers know, and how they know it he describes this innovation-oriented method taking the example of aircraft engineers.27 Vincenti's term is just one of a whole series of concepts tailored quite specifically to the innovative activities of engineers.28 According to David Noble, engineers are in search of the definition of new research problems;28 as they are employed by others, however, their innovations remain - almost of necessity - within the ruling paradigm.30 The great advantage of Hughes' concept of the system is that it covers both fields, the radical invention that sets the system going, and its further growth and development through innovation and improvement. This he defines as the standard path of technical evolution. It is no longer the inventive engineers who are responsible for the spread of the system via growth, transfer, competition, and consolidation, but rather the businessmen in the form of managers and (in the final analysis) financiers.31 Mikael Hard has defined the 'social career' of a technology. Motivation, organisation, social and economic power, information, resources, and know-how are the yardsticks by which to gauge the chances of an existing technology, an archetype, being implemented in a new environment.32 Models from economics The economic sciences have generated many mathematically elegant theories regarding the role technological change plays in establishing market equilibrium and its disruption.33 No economic theory can these days afford to ignore factors for technological change. The merit of these economics-oriented models is that they emphasise the 'demand' side more than do the purely 'supply'-oriented ones. This outward-looking view, to the market, characterises above all the models introduced by the economists, according to whom new technical standards were introduced deliberately. With their 'dominant designs' the economists pick out as central the associated advantages of dominating the market, securing one's position, and shaping the habits of consumers and end-users.34 The criterion of</page><page sequence="6">Hans-Liudger Dienel 75 market success does not hide the fact that technological leadership and setting of standards is only one of several possible strategies;35 another is the tactic of sailing in the wake of a larger ship, which involves much lower development costs.36 Economic models generally focus on the directive (formative) options open to managers,37 less on the consensus of participating 'actor networks'. Technology and its intrinsic momentum remain a kind of black box.38 A criticism of the economic models is that they examine production methods, but not the goods themselves. The technological change manifest in new products is neglected, with all its consequences.3' The socially constructed figures by which accountants assess companies -are sharply criticised by the economists Johnson and Kaplan in their book on the rise and fall of management accounting.40 Economics-oriented models have attempted to quantify the relationship between technological progress and the economy. Science and technology are interpreted as a productive force.41 Everything is countable: the number of graduates employed in the private sector, co-operation between companies and colleges, the impressive rise of research institutes both in industry and attached to universities, and their budgets which grow much faster than GDP42 However, all attempts to put a number on technical progress have failed. For example, some studies estimated the 'education' factor as being responsible for 20 per cent of economic growth in the USA in the early 20th century, while others arrived at a figure of only two per cent for Germany, a country which, in the 19th and 20th centuries, puts much more emphasis on education!43 The purely quantitative growth in research, or an observation of economic growth over the same period, are dangerous indicators of the scientific or technical quality and practical relevance of that research. In addition to looking at budgets and manpower we have to ask the qualitative question of what research projects were being supported.44 At the same time it must be admitted that the co-operation between economists and sociologists has been fruitful for both sides. The economist Giovanni Dosi, for example, uses the term 'technological trajectory' to describe how an innovation remains within, or breaks away from, the accepted technological paradigm or regime, expressions he took over from sociology.45 The Sussex group, 'headed' by Rothwell and later by Dosi, recognises five external reasons for an innovation being successful: better adaptation to consumer demand, more PR, better management, more technical and scientific support from abroad, greater seniority and authority than the competition.46 The Nelson-Winter-Dosi model ascribes a</page><page sequence="7">76 Sociological and Economic Technology Research central function to external conditions ('selection environments') in the evolutionary development of technology.47 According to Arie Rip, it is 'not free from deterministic undertones' that make it easier to handle.48 Though we as historians of technology cannot accept this reduced model, we have to concede economists the right to create decision-oriented tools. As David Chandler put it, 'any theory worth its salt should be able to predict'.49 This applies equally to that shy creature, a commercial view of the history of technology, which admittedly is somewhat outside our academic circles. 3. CRITIQUE Many of the concepts mentioned here are attractive, in that they explain technological change more or less persuasively. However, from a historian's point of view they have six major weaknesses, which lower their value for our purposes. First, they are all to some degree or another ahistorical. They attempt to trace a given tendency or driving force for all time and space. Admittedly, that makes them pithy and suitable for discussion, but it also makes them biased and short-sighted. Historical case studies play a major part in the distillation of laws and guidelines, but from a historical perspective they are often accidental in character. Models can easily be falsified, or they are so general that they degenerate into truisms and platitudes. Of course successful technologies were promoted by influential patrons. But that does not describe the specific historical conditions surrounding their success. Having said that I still consider that it makes sense to condense historical reality into a model, if not to such an extent as practised in the economic sciences. As historians are not obliged, however, to make decisions, it is not our place to accuse the economists of simplification and instrumentalizing. A second inherent contradiction of the models considered is that while they explicitly reject technological determinism, yet they try to find natural laws of technological genesis.50 The social constructivists endowed all the older theories with an internal determinism, but at the same time they set themselves the task of formulating the immutable tendencies of technical systems, for example when Peter Weingart recognises that a technological imperative 'may have to be implied'.511 consider this an attempt to apply rigid laws to the process of invention and market success. A third criticism is levelled at the selectivity of the models. Most of them centre on interpreting invention and innovation, seldom on</page><page sequence="8">Hans-Liudger Dienel 77 design and production - the everyday life of an engineer. We are lacking in concepts to describe normal technological operations. The accent is largely on large-scale technological systems and industry. Smaller and medium-sized companies, or inventions which fail to catch on, have no place in the theories of the technology sociologists.52 Fourthly, the concepts are based on supply, not demand, and are thus divorced from the reality of the market. The social process is described in terms of technological traditions and paradigms, 'technological orientation complexes' and 'technological regimes', above all for the engineers - Bijker's 'technological frame' admittedly goes further.53 Peter Weingart criticises Thomas Hughes for making the invention the starting point of technological development. 'Giving pride of place to the invention ignores the effects of market puH.'54 Fifthly, the sociologists have not taken account of the impressive (historically as well as sociologically) rise in the academic status of engineers, the undoubted shapers of technology, even though the effect on technical education, the formation of professional bodies, and the social image of engineers has been very adequately investigated by historians of technology. Sixthly, the emphasis on the history of the organisation and the socio-political environment pushes the sociology of technology dangerously far from real technology and the actual work of engineers and technicians.55 The use of terms borrowed from technology cannot camouflage this distance from the real artefact. Readers are left with the unpleasant aftertaste that in spite of all the organisation and funding they never reached the nub of the matter. The sociologists are fond of pointing out this defect in each other. Rammert and Joerges, for example, accuse the social-constructivist studies of having a blind spot, 'inasmuch as the analysis concentrates overwhelmingly on social discourses, draft plans, ..A56 Rammert in turn has the same criticism levelled at him by Andreas Knie,57 whose model also assumes 'that the chances of new and unconventional technological patterns becoming established and assuring themselves a long-term position can be assigned less to their technical contribution and more to their organisational and political ability to generate a 'power of definition".58 It is remarkable what little use the sociological studies make of technical sources; for example Knie and Hârd manage almost entirely without references to sources. That stand contrasts with their claim to be painting technology in action.</page><page sequence="9">78 Sociological and Economic Technology Research Knie maintains that the sociology of technology has not progressed in the decade of its existence, or at least that its proponents 'evidently have no faith in the knowledge thus gained'.59 They therefore continue to claim in the introductions to their books that they are breaking new ground. I believe that the history of technology has much to learn from these models, so poor in sources and so rich in concepts. Particularly in the United States, historians of technology have entered into a fruitful symbiosis with the sociologists. They contribute historical examples, and receive models as a reward or a stimulus. In spite of all criticism, one can say with conviction that this framework has fertilised and invigorated the history of technology.60 4. CONCLUSIONS: TOWARDS A CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY As historians of technology we are committed to the historical category of individuality, and are engaged in the search for ways and means to understand technology as a cultural construction. We therefore need methods and results borrowed from our neighbouring disciplines. However, the decisive methodological stimuli should not come only from the supply-oriented social sciences or the demand-oriented economic view. The ethnographic results of Bruno Latour, for example, appear more important at the moment. Kuhn's model already was and is cross-pollinated by socio psychological and anthropological points of view. Collins, Latour, and Knorr-Cetina took their concept of 'observation by participation' from the methods familiar to ethnography; they immersed themselves in laboratories for months on end with a notepad in their hands, and thus made people aware of the local character of the creation of knowledge and pointed out the problems of reproducibility of results - particularly in large-scale research projects. Scientific knowledge, they said, is moulded by the context: for example by the hierarchies within a lab or the 'perception filter formed by laboratory equipment. The experience gained in carrying out an experiment is 'tacit knowledge' that is hard to communicate to others;61 the knowledge created is local.62 Collins points out that the 'taken-for-granted reality of newly created local knowledge increases with the distance from the place where it is generated; he speaks of a 'crystallisation of certainty'.63 Latour sees no functional difference between technology and society. He expresses their functional interchangeability as the</page><page sequence="10">Hans-Liudger Dienel 79 anthropomorphism of technology and technomorphism of man. The cultural approach leads the history of technology to a study of mankind. Since its foundation, the history of technology has had general marching orders in this direction, reflected, for instance, in the programmatic title of the journal Technology and Culture, with its German equivalents in the form of both a journal and a ten-volume encyclopaedia of the same name. Nevertheless, the cultural-history approach is still rare in the history of technology. Cultural history is experiencing a boom on all sides, but the history of technology derives little benefit. Fortunately, the concept of technological style has come back into use in the last few years. The number of models has increased, of course. I shall restrict myself to the idea of style, which I would describe as an ideal tool for a cultural history of technology. A style is an ideal type which exists not in reality but as a pattern for comparison. The concept comes from art, so historians should draw their definition of technological style from the history of art.64 Thomas Hughes understands it as the sum total of technological characteristics 'that give a machine, process, device, or system a distinctive quality'.651 find that definition too narrow. As early as 1922 Lewis Mumford defined style as 'the reasoned expression, in some particular work, of the complex of social and technological experience that grows out of a community' s life'.66 The concept of style is committed to the category of individuality. From the observation of specific characteristics we can draw conclusions on phenotypes and standards. Many of the models I have mentioned earlier proceeded in the opposite direction, searching for historical examples to fit their ideas of technological change. The concept of style is more cautious in that respect; it does not suggest a particular course of history. There are three levels to characterising technological style. First, it describes the peculiarities of the workpiece, the technological artefact itself: its shape, size, function, and appearance, but also the size of factories or technical fields. The technical vocabulary is adequate in this respect. Secondly, we mean the activities of the engineers and technicians, the degree to which their methods are scientific and they take pleasure in experimenting, their accuracy, flexibility, versatility, creativity, thrift, speed, diligence (or the lack of those qualities), the different degree of scepsis and the ability to draw selective parallels. Thirdly, the consumers of technology must be taken into account. If we wish to go beyond a mere enumeration of the symptoms of style and arrive at an explanation, we must recognise and assess the</page><page sequence="11">80 Sociological and Economic Technology Research factors which influence it. That brings us to mentalities and attitudes, stylised social patterns, and emotions. Only thus can we explain why the people and the technology of a past age or a distant country are so different. However, we must be careful not to operationalize mentalities, attitudes, and emotions in an explanatory formula; the phenomena cannot be isolated from each other. Stimulated by the French 'nouvelle histoire', Thomas Nipperdey suggested using the term attitudes to link together society, culture, and the individual. The term describes the complex of expectations and behavioural disposition which mould our reactions to different situations, which form the interpretation horizon within which people understand themselves and their world.67 We should not underestimate the long term phenomena, the geographical differences such as climate, the nature of the soil, and demographic features. These also mould people and create the immediate boundary conditions for technology. Economic factors such as the cost of energy and labour, on the other hand, are subject to medium-term or even short-term change. The entire course of history results in attitudes and mentalities such as the work ethic, trustworthiness, individuality, the entrepreneurial spirit, or the legislative framework of government. To my mind, the concept of style (as sketched out here) offers four important advantages over the concepts mentioned at the beginning: The first is that it comes so near to the artefacts and technical processes that it leads us to investigate technological sources - technical drawings, products, processes, laboratory notebooks, models. In particular, it points us to non-literary sources, a methodological desideratum of the first order. It is a truism that the history of technology makes far too little use of non-literary sources. Regardless of the advantages or disadvantages of the concept of style, it is a central task of all methodological concepts to lead us to new sources and new questions. The second advantage of the concept of style is that it comes near to the idea of the creative technician. The artist Wassily Kandinsky described style as 'inner necessity', following from the individual's handwriting, the epoch in which he lives, and lasting values. A study of style can tie up the individual, society, and culture, whereas many sociological models pass glibly over the individual. Despite its closeness to reality, the concept of style has the third advantage of remaining a cultural term. It takes technology as something cultural, and thus challenges us to a new understanding of technology. That contrasts with many social histories of technology which explain specific technological differences by</page><page sequence="12">Hans-Liudger Dienel 81 means of a diverse cultural mould, but still believe in the existence of an essentially 'pure' technology. They assume that the differences are a kind of cultural 'noise' or 'clutter' which can somehow be smoothed out mathematically. Fourthly, the concept of style encourages comparative studies. Indeed, it is only through comparison that styles become visible and impinge on our consciousness. There are still too few comparative studies in the history of technology. It is for that reason that the theory of 'natural laws' of technological change has survived so long. These four advantages lead us to a more manifold and differentiated history of technology. Of course, every historical way of understanding must reduce the complexity of historical reality. That is precisely the task of the methodological framework. But many successful studies have shown that by restricting ourselves to definite historical events it becomes possible to achieve a socio culturel reconstruction of technology. It could be argued that the history of art has long-since distanced itself from the concept of style. But art historians became suspicious of the term only after a century of fruitful detailed studies. The history of technology has yet to go through that phase.
