Probing into the significance of past events and thoughts, he ar- rives at a number of key concepts through which he approaches the contemporary problem of a theory of order and history. In the first volume, his attention was turned to the materials of what one might roughly call the Old Testament World. The most significant result of this analysis was his concept of "exodus" - the movement of a people out of a "cosmological" order (an order in which the experi- ences "we," "ruler," "universe," "nature," "man," and "god" were all welded together into a compact whole, and, thus, glorification of god amounted also to self-glorification) into a covenanted relation- ship with God who was experienced as a person confronting the people with His commandments (so that the people's history then became a matter of tension between God and man and subject to divine judg- ment). The historical exodus from Egypt was interpreted as an event by which new kinds of insights into man's relation with God created a new political order, so that human existence was lifted to a higher level of quality. The break-through to the higher type of life Voegelin called the "leap in being." This concept in turn enabled him to see historical events and experiences in the light of a forward moving direction of order, a philosophy of history equally distant from the circular pat- terns of the Spengler-Toynbee variety and the automatic progressivism of the Enlightenment. The present two volumes deal with another "exodus." This time it is one that occurred not in the form of a single dramatic event but in a gradual process of spiritual and intellectual growth from the compactness of a national myth into a deep and differentiated knowl- edge of man's soul in the light of a more developed understanding of transcendence. This process took place in Greece during the four cen- turies separating Homer from Aristotle. The historical changes which Voegelin treats in these two volumes are the emergence of Hellenic society out of the collapse of the Achaean civilization, its articulation into the political order of the polis, the decline of that order after the Peloponnesian War, the recovery of order through the creation of a new science of politics by Plato, in conflict with both the powers-that- be and the older poetic myths that had shaped Hellenic society. The inquiry into these changes is pursued by way of analyses of the great literary creations which mark the road, most prominently those of Homer, Hesiod, Xenophanes, Parmenides and Heraclitus, Plato's Gorgias, Republic, Statesman, Timaeus, Laws, and Aristotle's Nico- machean Ethics and Politics. If the earlier volume centered in the main concept of "exodus," the comparable emphasis in the present two volumes could be said to lie in the recurrent theme of "the myth." In describing the break- through to a new level of life from Homer to Plato, Voegelin shows</page><page sequence="3">590 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS how man's political order moves forward by way of speculation about transcendence. Man's understanding of himself, in other words, is inseparable from his understanding of transcendent reality. What men know about the gods or God is the measure of their grasp of human life. In Greece, then, an "exodus" occurred, not through a nation's pledge to God under the thunder and lightnings of a holy mountain, but by way of the philosophic discovery of the human soul in the course of speculations about the gods. The "leap in being" was achieved when Plato found higher knowledge of political order by means of a new speculative discipline: theology. Far-flung and politically scattered Hellenic society experienced unity first through the common property of the Homeric myths. Ho- mer's poems created a public orientation through his account of how disorderly passions in key figures on both sides of the Trojan War wrought large-scale destruction. The inordinate wrath of Achilles and the inordinate lust of Paris end up by thwarting reason and common good and bringing down untold misery on victors as well as van- quished. Homer's work thus helped establish a common public knowl- edge of right and wrong among a people divided into many independ- ent states. Hesiod, writing from bitter personal experiences of a later time of troubles, speculated about destructive forces among the gods themselves. In addition, he provided the Greeks with a philosophy of history in the form of a myth of mankind's various ages. Hesiod's work reflects deep anxieties. Comparing it with the later thought of Thucydides, which sprang from a similar mood, Voegelin observes: "When the bleakness of annihilation creeps over a society . . . it is doubtful whether one can still speak of order at all .... The assump- tion of the nihilist that his personal nothingness is the measure of man is the great error of 'realism.' " Reflection on despair, in other words, cannot produce order, which rather requires reflection on the divinity. Homer and Hesiod both deal with gods much as they would with men, but this, to Voegelin, is not "anthropomorphism," that is, the trans- ferring of the idea of man to divinities. At this historical phase, he contends, there was no idea of man that could be transferred. Rather, the idea of man emerges only as a result of a further developed no- tion of God, particularly of one God. And as a differentiated idea of man thus emerges, the phenomenon called "anthropomorphism" dis- appears. This development occurred among the Greeks in the person of Xenophanes who turned against Homer and Hesiod for their "un- seemly" ideas about the gods. This critique led him on the one hand to the concept of one greatest and universal God, and, on the other, to new notions of human virtue which he opposed to the then pre- vailing customary standards. Thus discovery of God turned out to be also the discovery of the human soul (a concept for which Homer's language did not even have a word). Discovering the soul is "not a</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 591 collective process but occurs in ... specifically gifted persons," who in the name of higher wisdom confront the community with the for- mula: "You have heard it said . . . but I say unto you!" The philo- sophic discoveries were pushed further by Parmenides who made the significant distinction between the truth of being and delusions about being, and Heraclitus, who saw the common order of logos in the midst of strife and flux. These advances in knowledge undermined the security of the Homeric myth. "The order of the polis cannot re- main the unquestioned, ultimate order of society when an idea of man is in formation that identifies humanity with the life of the common Logos in every soul. What appears negatively as the break with the myth is positively the transition from a theomorphic symbolization of experiences to their understanding as movements of the human soul itself. The true range of humanity comes into view correlatively with the radical transcendence of the divine realissimum." The philosopher, as he makes such discoveries, however, "has no information to tender; he can only communicate the discovery which he has made in his own soul, hoping that such communication will stir up parallel discoveries in the soul of others. . . . Nothing follows from this adventure with regard to social organization directly, though indirectly . . . because the hierarchy of purposes for individual action has changed." The sequence of philosophic discoveries seems to be heading straight for Plato, but in the history of fifth century Greece there first intervened a period of steep decline during which the Sophists all but destroyed the spiritual substance of Hellenic society. Plato's achieve- ment, then, was the creation of order in a society which had already deteriorated to the extent of regarding law but a convenient cloak for arbitrary willfulness and threatening with violent death any one who would recall it to the path of righteousness. Voegelin's construction of Plato's growing wisdom from the Republic to the Laws is the cli- max of the two volumes. The center of this analysis is his discussion of the Timaeus which illuminates Voegelin's concept of political or- der in greater depth than any other part of the study. Briefly, Voegelin places the Republic, the Statesman, the Timaeus (plus Critias) and the Laws into a line of continuously evolving in- sight into the problems of order, in which the Republic is an initial though yet uncompleted statement and the Laws the most mature and comprehensive articulation of Plato's wisdom. In the Republic, Plato developed a model order "laid up in heaven" and the constitutional pattern of the well ordered soul. The Statesman is concerned with the practical problem, the "royal art" of imposing something like an order resembling that model on an obstreperous society, which endeavor is found to require considerable amounts of force, including exiling and killing the uneducable parts of the people. It is in the twin dialogues Timaeus and Critias that Plato moves decisively beyond this solution through the creation of the complex myth of Atlantis and of the cre-</page><page sequence="5">592 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS ation of the world which, in evoking the subconscious as well as the conscious assent of souls, would replace compulsion largely with per- suasion. The myth is Plato's way of communicating the order of his own soul to the people. Through the story of the struggle between Athens and Atlantis, it transfers the order of the Republic from ab- stract timelessness into the historical memory of the Athenians, and through the myth of the Demiurge it links that memory with the or- der of the cosmos - gods, nature, men. Thus the Timaeus, going far beyond the Republic, "projects the soul on the larger canvas of the cosmos." And now the Laws return to statesmanship on the higher level thus achieved. "Within the boundaries drawn by the myth of the cosmos, the position of Plato evolves from the Republic to the Laws in a manner that can be best elucidated with the evolution from the Sermon on the Mount to the institutionalized Church." Here the philosopher-king is replaced by the divine player of human puppets. The laws signify the presence of the divine spirit in the lives of men, felt in the same way in which the puppet may feel the pull of the golden chord. Instead of the embodiment of divine order in the soul of the ruler, we have its embodiment in the dogma of the polis. These illustrations may be sufficient to convey some idea of what Voegelin means by political order. The substance of an order society is spiritual. It consists ultimately in "habituations of the soul" of in- dividuals. If such order is not to rely on mere subservience to power, it must be established by spiritual persuasion. Ultimate political au- thority then lies with persons whose soul is well ordered and who have gained deep insights into the order of being that permeates and tran- scends man, insights they have learned to communicate to their fellow men. Political order flows from such men of authority and depends on the capacity of others to recognize and heed authority when they see it. Whatever else is of use to society: prudential knowledge, in- stitutional arrangements, etc., requires the deeper and previous foun- dation of spiritual orientation, unless it is to be maintained by mere brute force and deception. The man of authority himself gains knowledge of order by his own "experience" as he lovingly opens his soul towards transcendent truth, a truth which he can love but in the nature of things never possess completely. The insights thus gained can be communicated only in symbolic form, of which the myth is an example as good as the philosophic theory. The myth has the advan- tage of embracing layers of the subconscious which more intellectual symbolizations may miss. Voegelin sees the "truth" of a myth not in its correspondence to real events in time and place, but in its corre- spondence to the experiences of order in a soul that loves wisdom. "The 'truth' of the myth will arise from the unconscious, stratified in depth into the collective unconscious of the people, the generic un- conscious of mankind, and the deepest level where it is in communica- tion with the primordial forces of the cosmos." Any myth, since it ex-</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 593 presses actual movements of the soul, is therefore "true" simply by existing and can become untrue only as spiritual consciousness grows to new levels or man's relation to his environment significantly changes. The myth, in other words, is a piece of self-knowledge of mankind in the light of knowledge of the world-transcending summum bonum. "The more I am by myself and alone," Voegelin quotes Aristotle, "the more have I come to love myths." Aristotle's own prudential science of politics, Voegelin shows, was established on the basis of the deeper order created by Plato's myth. Aristotle's "mature man" is a man whose soul is formed by the order of the myth and whose habits are therefore legitimate objects of scientific inquiry. The core of political order is the spiritual order of the soul. "The substance of the cosmos, including man and society, is psyche illuminated by intelligence. ... The theory of the myth is itself a myth; its truth is not the truth of the intellect but the self-authenticating truth of the psyche." Voegelin's work, since it consists of studies of a number of different authors strung together to form a consistent history of order, could be criticized either by questioning the over-all result or through at- tacks on the various component parts. The latter is an approach that will tempt the specialists, particularly since Voegelin makes short shrift of numerous conventional readings of the classics (for example, of Homer, Thucydides, Parmenides, Plato's Laws, to name but a few). Considering the masses of material which Voegelin has worked into his study, it is to be expected that he could be convicted of a number of mistakes in matters of detail. But suppose he is wrong in part, must that invalidate the total result? Voegelin's method is not one of gathering facts with the hope of finding in them an order of which he knew nothing before he began to look. He is concerned with things of the spirit, and his inquiry is therefore an undertaking in self-dis- covery. "The theory of the myth is itself a myth . . ." What he de- scribes in these two volumes is a "leap in being," a break-through of human consciousness to higher truth. If this break-through were nothing but a fact in the remote past, he would not be able to describe it. He can illuminate the process insofar as the evocation of the past is a piece of self-illumination, because the insights then achieved have become permanent gains in truth, part of our collective consciousness, order by which we now live. The great persons and works of his study thus are studied not merely and not mainly with a view to improve historical data but above all to play the role for which Plato designed the Republic: a paradigma of right thinking. Voegelin's analysis of past achievements of order is meant to become the occasion for a re- discovery of order in our own age. The history of order is presented as an ultimately self-authenticating experience in the order of history, its authenticity founded in the responding soul of the reader. Instead of practicing the usual carping critique, this reviewer would therefore like to dwell on the peculiar - and very great - difficulties</page><page sequence="7">594 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS of communication between Voegelin and his readers, particularly those trained in modern political science. These difficulties are likely to crystallize around specific issues. Many readers, for instance, will balk at Voegelin's insistence that political order entails speculation about "the transcendence." They object to this as an "obscurantist" back- slide into a theocratic past. They may fear that Voegelin wants to drag them through the back door of political theory into a commit- ment to religious revelation. Others may shrink from Voegelin's stress on the key role of the "experiences" as the source of wisdom and may feel that he adds insult to injury when he calls inquiry centering in such experiences an empirical science. Still others may wonder in what sense Voegelin can speak of order when, for instance, the ideas of Plato did not issue in a single constitution during his lifetime, failed to rally the Greeks to unity, and survived only in the halls of private schools of philosophy. The nature of these objections indicates that the problem of com- munication between Voegelin and his readers is itself a problem of contemporary political order. Insofar as Voegelin's inquiry appears to the modern political scientist incomprehensible to the point of utter irrelevance, we reveal that we cannot grasp why anyone would look for political order where he is looking, and that by contrast we are committed to think of politics exclusively in terms of institutional ar- rangements or material conditions, at any rate in the framework of immanentism. Now a determination to interpret man and society in materialist or immanentist terms is in itself a metaphysics of political order. The question whether it is a good or adequate metaphysics, one capable of reflecting the truth of political order, must be raised. It is precisely this question to which Voegelin's analysis of the great Greek achievement is addressed, and at several places he makes comparisons between the two ways of solving the problem of political order. In connection with Aristotle, for instance, he remarks as follows: "The metaphysical construction of human nature as an immanent form is technically inadequate. . ... We shall meet with a similar theoretical situation at the end of the Middle Ages when, with the disintegration of Christianity and the new wave of immanentism, political thinkers began to evoke the idea of an intramundane realization of perfect hu- man existence. The immanentization of transcendental fulfillment re- sulted at that time in the development of political 'ideals' and ulti- mately the political chiliasm of transforming society into a terrestrial paradise by means of organization and violence. The modern, im- manentist possessors of Truth do not hesitate to extend its blessedness to everybody whom it does not concern." Human life in society, Voegelin maintains, partakes in a structure of order that permeates as well as transcends it. Reflections about the transcendent aspects can therefore not be separated from reflections about human life. And the reverse also is true: there can be no "theological" development apart</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 595 from a development of the order of existence in human society. Voegelin's emphasis on the creative and revelatory role of the "ex- periences" of the wise is obviously based on the epistemological premise that the movements of a soul that lovingly turns toward the source of wisdom and truth are not accidental but reflect otherwise unseen realities. Such experiences are therefore scientific data, the rock bot- tom of reality in a realm where everything else is but opinion. The branch of human knowledge that is concerned with the order of being therefore is empirical only when reflecting such experiences. Apart from them, it deteriorates into a play with intellectual formulae un- controlled by any test of reality. This latter kind of philosophy, which Voegelin calls "the perennial type of enlightened philosophy," is found not only in the eighteenth century but also among the Sophists, where Voegelin analyzes it as follows: "The thinker operates on symbols that have been developed by mystic-philosophers for the expression of ex- periences of transcendence. He proceeds by ignoring the experiential basis, separates the symbols from this basis as if they had a meaning independent of the experience which they express, and with brilliant logic shows, what every philosopher knows, that they will lead to con- tradictions if they are misunderstood as propositions about objects in world-immanent experience .... Philosophy by definition has its cen- ter in the experience of transcendence." Voegelin does not assert that Plato created a "positive" political order in his time. On the contrary, Plato failed in his attempt to res- cue Athenian society from self-destruction, and his failure even be- came the philosophical starting point for Aristotle's contemplations. But Plato's images of the divine and the human, his hierarchy of ex- cellences, and the anchorage which he secured for political order in the absolute order of being became, after his time, common property of many peoples in several civilizations and the source of a public knowledge of right and wrong, things important and unimportant. Plato and Aristotle linked the knowledge of heaven and earth in po- litical wisdom which, along with other elements, entered into the structure of Christian society. In this sense Voegelin is correct when saying: "The scriptures of both Israel and Hellas are the Old Testa- ment of Christianity." What we, thanks to Plato and Aristotle, know about the soul in the light of knowledge about being, is of the sub- stance of Western political order. That does not mean, of course, that a science of institutions is superfluous. Aristotle founded a sociology of politics that has been embodied into the basic knowledge of order. Apart from the fundamental spiritual order, however, there is also an independent science of political practice existing in its own right: "In all civilizations ... empirical science does not originate in philosophy but in the knowledge of the craftsman. When such a body of em- pirical knowledge falls into the hands of professional theorists, it may flower into a science if the methods are suitable. . . . Thucydides let</page><page sequence="9">596 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS the political craftsmen . . . form and formulate the eidos of the kinesis which he as a scientist described .... The political science of Thucy- dides was a model study of the suicide of a nation but hardly a study of successful political order .... Thucydides studies a political society in crisis and created the empirical science of the lethal disease of or- der; Plato created the other half of politics, the empirical science of order." The problem of order which the present generation of political scientists is facing is that we feel too much at home with Thucydides and the Sophists, rather than with Plato and Aristotle. If this prob- lem as such is acknowledged, means and ways of doing something about it seem now to be shaping up. If we remain incapable of even seeing the problem as such, it may well be that the totalitarian mon- sters of our age are but the legitimate offspring of our own failings.
