(University of Kansas Press, Lawrence), i-xi, 1-316, 22 photographs, 5 graphs, 1 map, 57 tables, 6 appendices, literature cited, index, 1951. Price, $5.00.-This book deals with the relations be- tween members of the same or opposite sexes that involve actions of both aggressive and "love-habit" nature. The study was carried over ten seasons, 1936 to 1946, of intensive field work on the Otago Peninsula in New Zealand. Special attention is given to the Yellow-eyed Penguin, Megadyptes antipodes, but reference is also paid to corresponding behavior in other penguins and in other birds so that the discussions of concepts have general application. Altogether, some 292 matings were observed between 88 male and 96 female Yellow-eyed Penguins. All birds were banded, and the home-made bands bore numbers sufficiently large to be read through a telescope as far as 120 feet away. Both love-habits and aggressive behavior have value in social relations, in pair- formation, and in family affairs. Aggressive behavior also functions against preda- tors and as warning. Love-habits are of various sorts which are designated as: salute, sheepish look, throb, shake, excited shake, open-yell, half trumpet, welcome, full trumpet, arms act, mutual preen, kiss-preen, bowing, and ecstatic. Aggressive behavior is described as tete, open yell, sheepish look, glare, and physical force. Substitute activities occur commonly as the result of antagonistic drives, lack of proper stimtulation for the reaction to be expected, exhaustion of normal reactions, or physical inability to respond with the proper behavior. Each type of behavior has a special significance in the life of the bird, and the description, illustration, and analysis of the circumstances and the sequences in which these various behavior- traits occur are the essence of this book. Pair-formation may occur at any time of the year in the Yellow-eyed Penguin but most commonly in the winter at the peak of the sexual phase. The birds appear to have a definite and continuing recognition of each other as individuals, and there is immediate recognition of sex without "trial and error." The adornments on the head and neck have no function relative to love-habits but may be useful at sea in enabling the bird to recognize its own species. Love-habits keep the birds mutually stimulated, but copulation occurs when the female is ready and not as the direct result of any special stimulation by the male. The gonadal development of the female and the laying date appear also not to be influenced by the male. Copulation may occur at intervals during the pre-egg stage but ceases a day or two before the eggs are laid. The female is receptive of coition only at intervals, but the male is sexually ready at all times. Continuing love-habits hold the sexes together through- out the nesting period. Love-habits have a further function in bringing unmated birds together to get acquainted, which may ultimately result in pairing. The initiative for pairing may come from either sex. Some individuals appear to have an affinity for each other that affects pairing. Affinity between an unmated bird and one of a pair may lead to "divorce" of the pair. Other causes of divorce are the domi- nance that may be exerted by one bird, usually an unmated male, over a pair and the prolonged absence of one member of a pair. Fifty-five per cent of matings remain intact in the succeeding season, 33 per cent break up because of death or disappearance of one or both birds, and 12 per cent of the birds separate and remate with other individuals. One pair remained intact for 11 seasons. Probably remating actually occurs each season, even in pairs that remain intact, but this is facilitated by return of birds to the old nesting-site, recog-</page><page sequence="2">532 Recent Literature [OAuk nition of each other, and personal attachment. Owing to a surplus of males, there is competition and intrasexual selection among the males for mates. Females seldom remain unmated, and there may be some competition for particular mates also among the females. The normal breeding age is three years, but 22.8 per cent of recovered two-year olds are known to have bred. There is very little evidence of social hierarchy beyond the low level of "super- sedence" in the loose colonial groups of penguins. Some degree of dominance is involved, however, when one male acquires the mate of another over the other's objection. Territory is expressed in the defense of the actual or potential nest-site, the nest and its contents, chicks out of the nest, and the mate. The male usually does the fighting for territory, although the female helps in some cases. Both sexes fight among themselves over sex-partners and together against enemies. Sexual fighting largely ceases once the eggs have been laid and does not begin again until the departure of the young. It may occur at any other time of the year when the birds are ashore. "Unemployed" birds, so-called, are those without eggs or chicks at the time mated pairs have them. The causes of unemployment among various species of birds are immaturity, unbalanced sex-ratio, and loss of mate, eggs, or young. Non-breeding birds constituted 35 per cent of the total population over a period of years. Un- employed birds are tolerated by the breeding birds as long as they do not infringe on territories. Love-habits occur among these birds at all times of year, and "trum- peting" is far more prevalent with them than with the nesting group. The presence and competition of these unemployed but potentially breeding birds in the nesting community probably raises the level of mating efficiency and is of advantage to the species as a whole. Incubation of the two eggs averages 42 days and is performed alternately by each sex. Attentive periods vary from one to five days but average about 1.8 days. There is a ceremony of nest-relief. As a rule both eggs hatch on the same day. The chicks are continuously brooded by both parents for the first two weeks but less regularly thereafter and not at all after the fourth week. One or the other parent guards the young during the day until the end of the sixth week but after that only at night. The second chick at one nest entered the sea approximately four months after hatching. Both parents share equally in watching and feeding the young. The chicks are fed at least once daily. There is no regular starvation period to induce grown young to leave for the sea. Both parent penguins and chicks recognize each other by sight or hearing. The Yellow-eyed Penguin does not form creches, and the author suggests that in the communistic groups of young and old in some other species each parent may possibly feed only its own young and that surplus adults may be "unemployed" individuals. In February, after nesting is over and the chicks have departed, there are about 23 days when the adults feed excessively and become very fat. This immediately precedes molting. The duration of the molt is usually 24 days, during which time the birds remain ashore and do not feed. Since most breeding birds begin their molt in March, this is the time of year when body weights are highest. Unemployed birds ordinarily molt earlier, occasionally as early as January. Molting is over in all birds by May. Body weight during this non-feeding period drops from 17.1 to 9.4 lbs. However, normal weight is regained by June and reaches another peak in August. There is special interest that in this resident penguin there is the same development of heavy deposits of fat prior to nesting that occurs in some passerine species just before migration. From late August to early October there is a second</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 681 Recent Literature 533 1951 fasting period as the adults are occupied with mating, nesting, and egg-laying. During incubation, as the birds take regular turns at feeding, there is gradual recovery of weight. Hatching occurs in November and body weight of the adults is generally maintained during the period of care of the young. During most of the year the male is heavier than the female. There is, however, no sure way of distinguishing sex by weight or by other measurements due to overlap in characteristics, although sex can be determined by examining the vent just after the eggs are laid. A long summary would be necessary to give adequate justice to the great mass of carefully detailed information that is made available in this book. There is evidence on every page that the author is keen in his observations, penetrating in his analysis, and conversant with related information on other species. The result is not only a thorough treatise of sexual behavior in one species, but also a useful summary for penguins as a group and a fundamental discuEsion applicable to birds in general with which any student of this phase of ornitholgy needs to be familiar. The author is very precise in his use of terms and gives each a very definite meaning. He follows J. S. Huxley in using "love-habits" instead of "courtship" since such behavior extends throughout the year and is not necessarily confined to behavior preparatory to pair-formation or coition as courtship may imply (p. 45). Elsewhere however (p. 6), he states that "in this paper 'courtship' is synonymous with love- habits." Not everyone will agree with all his usages of terms. The reviewer does not believe it necessary to distinguish between "territory" and "property-rights." This is done on the assumption that territory is a fixed, permanently located "de- fended area" and does not apply to the defense of a bird's mate, potential mate, or offspring when not on the immediate nest-area (p. 152). The term, territory, has, however, been used in the latter sense (D. W. Jenkins, Auk, 61: 30-47, 1944), and there is no good reason why it should not continue to be so used. The term "non- breeding," has been used commonly by other students in nearly the same sense that the author uses "unemployed" and would seem to be sufficiently inclusive. The reason given for the new term is to include those birds which, because of loss of eggs or chicks, are not actually nesting at the time of observation as well as the "true non-breeding birds" that do not nest at all during the season (pp. 7, 215). Perhaps "divorce" is an anthropomorphism and not a good term when applied to birds. "Separation" would have been better. Divorce in human affairs involves legal action that formally recognizes that a separation has taken place. Likewise the author makes the term include the mating of one of the pair with a third individual (p. 7). This is something quite different and does not in other species necessarily follow separation. These are, however, minor points and the book is recommended to the attention of all.-S. CHARLES KENDUIGH.</page></plain_text>
