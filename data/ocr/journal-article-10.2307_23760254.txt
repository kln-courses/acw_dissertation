<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Observations on the Loltun Relief Nikolai Grube and Linda Scheie The well known relief at the Nahkab entrance of the cave of Loltun in Yucatan (Fig. 1) was the earliest Maya sculpture associated with a cave to be described by archaeologists. The relief has been seen, studied and published by various scholars at the turn of the century, such as Edward Thompson (1897), Teobert Maler (Strecker 1981) (Fig. 2) and Henry Mercer (1975). The relief is one of the earliest, if not the earliest evidence for regal iconography in Northern Yucatan (Freidel</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. Drawing of the bas relief above the entrance to the Loltun cave, Yucatan. The drawing was completed by Linda Scheie from field notes, rubbings and photos. and Andrews 1985). Because of its affinities to other Late Preclassic monuments in the Maya Lowlands and to Izapan style sculpture of the Pacific slope, the Loltun relief is widely accepted as having been carved in the Late Preclassic period (Proskouriakoff 1950:154-155). Andrea Stone (1995:58) and Lee A. Parsons (1986:78) date the Loltun relief, together with other paintings in the cave into the period between A.D. 50 200. Excavations in the cave itself have recovered pottery seemingly as old as the S wasey ceramics from Northern Belize and indicate that the cave was continually occupied from the Preclassic to the Postclassic periods (Velazquez Valadez 1980,1981; Gonzalez Licon 1986,1987). The majority of the paintings in the cave, especially those from Room 5, are attributed to the Protoclassic period by Stone (1995:61). The relief scene, also known as "El Guerrero", is accom panied by a short hieroglyphic caption which to date has received almost no scholarly attention. In the summer of 1994, we therefore visited the cave of Loltun in Yucatan and studied the relief at its entrance using binoculars. Our examination of the relief yielded details that allow us to suggest a date for the text written above and to the right of the figure's head and to identify some of the more difficult iconography. Linda Scheie has prepared a new drawing of the relief which is based on our examination as well as on Ricardo Velazquez Valadéz' rub bings (Fig. 1). As has long been recognized, the first glyph of the text is a day sign with the numerical coefficient three. The head variant sign occurs with a distinctive day sign cartouche. The day sign cartouche is larger in size then the other glyphs. This is a characteristic feature of early Maya texts (Justeson et al. 1985:40; Stone 1995:59). We could not see enough detail to identify the day, although the sign has usually been identified as 3 Chuwen (Coe 1976:118). In our examination we could see only the forehead with a curl that may represent a clump of hair. The rubbing by Ricardo Velazquez Valadéz (Fig. 3) shows the complete cartouche, although it is possible only to identify an animal or human type head. Michael Coe (personal communication, 1994) told us that detailed photographs in his possession lead him to believe it is a monkey head. The day sign is followed by four signs that appear to group into two blocks. The rubbing shows a fifth block at the bottom of the column that we could not discern through the binoc ulars. The first glyph below the day sign appears to be a hand with a yi sign below it. We think this could be either the "flat hand verb" that appears usually with tun glyphs in period ending phrases, or the homltzutz "completion" sign that usu ally has a bauble dangling from the first finger. The second verb usually appears with a yi suffix as its verbal inflection. Both verbs are regularly used as period-ending events. The main sign in the third glyph has a center horizon line, a series of parallel lines in the upper half, and a small oval in the lower half. This sign appears to us to be the T548 tunlhab "year" logograph. If these two identifications are correct, then this text records a period ending. In Classic texts, the T713a hand usually has the period that ended sitting in the hand, but in a significant group of texts, the object of the verb is removed to a block following the verb. We think this the case here. The last glyph in the column should be the name of the actor. If our identifications are correct, then the text reads "3 ??? he ended the hab/tun (name)". If this is a period-ending glyph, then the day sign must be Ahaw. Furthermore, since it is a Short Count recording only the period-ending expression and the Tzolk'in day, the likelihood is that it records a K'atun ending. A vast majority of the abbreviated period-ending Fig. 2. Sketch of the Loltun relief by Teobert Maler (after Strecker 1981). Fig. 2.

Rubbing of the Loltun relief by Ricardo Velazquez Valadez (Sharer 1994: Fig. 3.23) statements like this one can be identified as K'atun endings, simply because they are abbreviated. The giant Ahaw altars at Caracol, Tonina, Altar de Sacrificios and Quirigua use just such abbreviated statements. If the Loltun example is a K'atun ending, the day must be 3 Ahaw, and that leaves only two possibilities for the Long Count position because of its widely acknowledged Late Preclassic style: 7.10.0.0.0 3 Ahaw 13 Pax (July 25, 157 B.C.) 8.3.0.0.0 3 Ahaw 3 Xul (October 29, A.D. 100) We think the second alternative is the more likely because of the presence of the glyphic text, but neither can be eliminated based on the archaeological evidence. Even if we take the later of the two dates, the Loltun relief can now be identified as the earliest dated monument from the Maya lowlands. The Iconography We also think that part of the imagery bear comment in light of the earlyness of this image especially in Yucatan. The protagonist carries a club lined with flint or obsidian blades and a curved object that appears to be a fending stick. As Freidel and Andrews (1985) noted, these weapons are usually identified as non-Maya ones that were introduced by the Teotihuacanos in some scenarios (i.e. Uaxactun Stela 5) or by the Toltecs (i.e. Chichen Itza) in others. The fending stick in his left hand bears resemblance to a similar object carried by the figures on the piers of the South Temple in the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza. Both the style as well as the hieroglyphic date of the Loltun relief are too early to suggest influence from either source. Thus, we take the occurrence of these weapons in the Loltun carving as evidence that they were in fact Maya weapons with a long history of usage. Other imagery is also important, although we interprète the headgear a little differently than others before us. The lip Fig. 4. Chak representation on an Early Classic incised and modeled vessel (Taube 1992: Fig. 35a) and chin of an anthropomorphic Jester God appears just above the forehead of the figure. The zoomorphic head above is very likely to function as the headdress of this an thropomorphic Jester God. The motif at the very top appeared to us to be deer antlers rather then the head topknot of the Jester God or the lizard form identified by Freidel and An drews (1985). This usage of an anthropomorphic head tied to the front of a historical king's head is very reminiscent of early ruler portraits at Nakbe and in Group H at Uaxactun. The belt head has always been a problem in interpreting this figure. We found it no less of a problem in front of the carving, but we can now identify it as a long-snouted, skeletal creature with a snake emerging from its nostril. The figure also has a chain dangling from his belt. In most similar images a Chak head would be attached to the chain, but we could not discern it. Moreover, the rubbing suggests that it was either not included or it hung behind other streamers suspended from the belt. Rubbings, especially ones made without the background, can miss detail if the artist does not see it. A third possibility is that the belt head itself represents the missing Chak head. The burning serpent emanating from the mouth is a characteristic feature of Chak in Classic Maya art (Taube 1992: Fig. 6). The skeletal lower jaw has been pointed out by Stuart (1987) as an allograph to the T109 chak sign and appears as part of the back belt assemblage worn by an especially early representation of Chak from an Early Classic incised and modeled vessel (Fig. 4). With this early image of Chak the belt head also shares the flaming eyebrow and the hank of hair over the forehead. Finally, the figure wears a square-nosed serpent on his chin strap. This same image would later become a half-mask that covered the lower half of the face, rather than riding on the chin-strap of the headdress.

Im Sommer 1994 untersuchten die Autoren das präklassische Relief am Eingang der Höhle von Loltun und fertigten eine neue Zeichnung an, die gemeinsam mit früheren Photos und Abreibungen zu der hier erstmals publizierten synthetischen Zeichnung zusammengeführt wurden. Die Studie des Hieroglyphentextes führte zu dem Ergebnis, daß der Text das Ende eines K 'atun 3 Ahaw beschreibt. In Abstimmung mit dem archäologischen Kontext werden zwei Daten vorgeschlagen, von denen das späteste in das Jahr 100 n.Chr. fällt und damit das älteste Datum im Mayatiefland überhaupt ist. Der dargestellte Herrscher hält in seiner linken Hand eine Waffe; solche Waffen wurden früher als Anzeichen für Einflüsse aus dem mexikanischen Hochland gehalten, das Vorkommen in Loltun deutet aber auf einen lokalen Ursprung hin. RESUMEN: Nuevas observaciones acerca del relieve de la cueva de Loltun, Yucatan. En verano de 1994, los autores investigabaron el relieve preclâsico en la entrada de la cueva de Loltun e hicieron un nuevo dibujo, que junto con fotos anteriores y calcos fueron reunidos en el dibujo sintético publicado en este trabajo por primera vez. El estudio del texto jeroglffico did como resultado que el texto describe el final de un K'atun 3 Ahaw. De acuerdo con el contexto arqueolögico se proponen dos fechas, de las cuales la mâs probable coincide con el ano 100 d. C. y de esta manera constituye la fecha mâs antigua en todas las tierras bajas mayas. El soberano representado lleva en su mano izquirda una arma; taies armas se consideraron antes como signos para influencias procedentes del altiplano mexicano, la existencia en Loltun indica sin embargo mâs bien un origen local.</page></plain_text>
