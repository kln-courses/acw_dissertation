<plain_text><page sequence="1">YEATS, THE TAROT, AND THE GOLDEN DAWN By KATHLEEN RAINE 1 became curious about Yeats's use of the Tarot cards because my attention had been caught by an observation in Hone's Life that among the young poet's few and treasured posses sions in his rooms in London in the 1880's was a Tarot pack. His allusions to certain Tarot symbols?Tower, Wheel, Magician, Chariot?are bound to strike anyone who has played at fortune telling with Madame Sosostris's "wicked pack of cards". What I did not know thirty years ago, when under the spell of The Waste Land I bought myself a Tarot pack, was that the set I used with instructions and commentary by A. E. Waite, had been designed for the use of members of the Hermetic Society of the Golden Dawn, of which both Waite and Pamela Coleman-Smith (who executed the emblems) were members. So of course was Yeats, who also published, with Masefield, Synge, and others, in Miss Coleman-Smith's little magazine, The Green Sheaf. So I found myself at the very first step in the deep waters of those magical studies about which Yeats knew so much and his academic commentators know so little; for the kind of knowledge to which members of that Order aspired cannot in its nature be understood in academic terms. The merely academic study of magical symbolism may be likened to the analysis of musical scores by a student who does not know that the documents he meticulously annotates are merely indications for the evocation of music from instruments of whose very existence he is ignorant. The Tarot, although associated with Gypsy fortune-tellers, *I wish to thank Mr. Gerald Yorke for the^ loan of unpublished documents from his collection of Golden Dawn material, and of his own essay on the Order; Mr. Geoffrey Watkins, for much firsthand information, and for the loan of books; Mr. John Symonds, for the trouble which he took to borrow for me Israel Regardie's four volumes of the Golden Dawn rituals; and, above all, the lender of unpublished Golden Dawn manu scripts, who wishes to remain anonymous.</page><page sequence="2">KATHLEEN RAINE 113 especially in Italy and the South of France, was clearly not in vented by the Gypsies. That it embodies, in the form of em blems, ancient Egyptian mythology is also unlikely, though Court de G?belin, the first scholar to come under the spell of the Tarot, put forward this theory as long ago as 1781. Another theory of the origin of the Tarot associates it with the Jewish esoteric tradition of the Cabbala. This is the view of Eliphas L?vi, from whose Histoire de Magie Mathers (that "learned but unscholarly man", as Yeats calls him) quotes: The absolute hieroglyphical science had for its basis an alphabet of which all the gods were letters, all the letters ideas, all the ideas numbers, and all the numbers perfect signs. A. E. Waite suggests another possible origin of the Tarot sym bols, among the Albigensians; some of them, he points out, cor respond very closely with those watermarks which Harold Bayley in his New Light on the Renaissance and The Lost Lan guage of Symbolism (a book Yeats knew) had so ingeniously and convincingly shown to have embodied in emblematic form many of the beliefs of the persecuted and scattered heirs of the Trouba dours. He instances the Ace of Cups, which resembles the Albigensian device that represents the grail. In any case, the practice of the Golden Dawn, like that of the Theosophical Society, was an unbounded eclecticism: if several al ternatives exist, accept all. Eclecticism may be unscholarly but must lead to enrichment of connotation. Such moments of im passioned syncretism have (as at the time of the Renaissance) often accompanied vital movements of the arts. The Egyptian theory of the origin of the Tarot formed at once a justification and a bridge for the introduction of the Egyptian pantheon into a system basically Cabbalistic. H. P. Blavatsky had already woven into her own eclectic theosophy an exotic strand of Egyptian wisdom; she quotes continually from the Book of the Dead. For 8</page><page sequence="3">114 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN the theosophist, Egyptian mythology had the double charm of antiquity and novelty. Plato, Pythagoras, and Moses had vener ated the wisdom of the Egyptians, of which so little is known and so much surmised. The legendary Egyptian magus Hermes Trismegistus remained a venerated figure throughout the Chris tian Middle Ages, and the Herm?tica has at all times been a sacred book in the canon of the Western esoteric tradition. At the same time, it was all new; the pantheon of the land of magic ?Thoth, Isis, Osiris, Horus, Hathor, and Maat?had not be come, like Venus and Cupid and Apollo, a currency worn thin by use, their numinosity long since faded. For the poet in search of valid symbols there is, besides, much to be said for theriomorphic gods. Animal forms belong not to history but to timeless nature; a universal language still new when pantheons are old, and yet still able to form a link with ancient sacred meaning. The "Golden-Eyed Hawk of the Sun", the moon-ruled cat, "the Great Cackler", tggy lotus, or familiar donkey?all Egyptian symbols?enabled Yeats to mask esoteric themes in forms accept able in their own right. Since what follows belongs to the teachings and rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, it will be convenient to give here a short summary of the history of the Order. This be gins in 1884, when from a bookstall in Farringdon Street?so the story goes?the Rev. A. F. A. Woodford bought some cypher manuscripts. These he showed to two friends, both eminent Freemasons, and members also of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia: Dr. Woodman and W. Wynn Westcott. They were also shown to a Scotsman, S. Liddell Mathers, who was soon, under the spell of the Celtic movement, to become MacGregor Mathers, then MacGregor; and later still, living in France (his wife was the sister of the philosopher Bergson), he revived the title of some ancestor and became the Comte de Glenstrae. Be fore Yeats met him he used to see him in the British Museum reading-room where he copied manuscripts on magical ceremonial</page><page sequence="4">KATHLEEN RAINE 115 and doctrine (Yeats himself must at this time have been work ing on Blake) : "a man of thirty-six or thirty-seven, in a brown velveteen coat, with a gaunt resolute face, and who seemed, be fore I heard his name, or knew the nature of his studies, a figure of romance". "It was through him mainly," Yeats has written in The Trembling of the Veil, "that I began certain studies and experiences, that were to convince me that images well up before the mind's eye from a deeper source than conscious or subconscious memory." The Rev. Mr. Woodford's cypher manuscripts proved to con tain instructions to the finders to communicate with "a continental adept" through a certain Fr?ulein Sprengel, whose address in Hanover was given. How the manuscripts found their way to a bookstall in Farringdon Street is not explained. A. E. Waite in his Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross gives it as his view that the manuscripts were post-1880 and emanated from a continental society of Rosicrucians. Yeats in A Vision tells how the legendary Michael Robartes, following from Rome a ballet-dancer with whom he had fallen in love, parted with her at last in Vienna. "To make the quarrel as complete as possible I cohabited with an ignorant girl of the people and hired rooms ostentatious in their sordidness. One night I was thrown out of bed and saw when I lit my candle that the bed, which had fallen at one end, had been propped up by a broken chair and an old book with a pig-skin cover. In the morn ing I found that the book was called Speculum Angelorum et Hominum, and had been written by a certain Giraldus and been printed at Cracow in 1594." Yeats's fiction is obviously based upon the actual events leading to the foundation of the Golden Dawn and the miraculous manuscript which finds its way into the hands for which it is intended. On March first, 1888, a warrant was drawn up for the constitu tion of the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer, with two higher degrees, the Roseae Rubeae and the Aureae Crucis; a</page><page sequence="5">116 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN perhaps mythical Third Order of Masters was also said to exist. In 1889 a letter was published in Lucifer announcing that "this society studies western traditions . . . the Theosophical Society has friendly relations with them." Yeats says in his Auto biographies that his initiation took place "in May or June 1887 in a Charlotte Street studio", nearly a year before the official foundation of the Isis-Urania Lodge in London. His name in the Order was Demon est Deus Inversus, Frater D. E. D. I. Apart from the cypher manuscripts and others unearthed from the British Museum and various continental libraries by Mathers, most of the early teaching of the inner order of the Roseae Rubeae and the Aureae Crucis was received clairvoyantly by Mrs. Mathers?a situation repeated long afterwards when Yeats's A Vision was similarly received by Mrs, Yeats. The more im portant rituals and instructions have been published in full by the Aries Press, Chicago, by Dr. Israel Regardie, who was a member of the Order in its later years. For the first few years all went well and the Order flourished. Among its early members were A. E. Waite, Florence Farr, the artist Horton, Edwin J. Ellis, the novelist Arthur Machen, Yeats's uncle George Pollexfen, Miss Horniman (who after wards endowed the Abbey Theatre), Maud Gonne, Allen Ben nett (who was later to become famous at a Buddhist Bhikku under the name of Ananda Metteya, whom Florence Farr followed to Ceylon), W. Peck the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Algernon Blackwood. A. E. (George Russell), though a member of the Theosophical Society, was never a member of the Golden Dawn. New temples came into existence, in Paris, Edinburgh, Bradford, and Weston-Super-Mare. However, the Order soon ran into difficulties; MacGregor, living in Paris, became increasingly autocratic; the last straw was his sending as his delegate, to take command of the Lodge, the notorious Aleister Crowley. Yeats was the leader of the success ful ejection of Crowley; the deposition of Mathers followed, in</page><page sequence="6">KATHLEEN RAINE 117 1900. In the following year Yeats held the office of Imperator in the Lodge. But that was only the beginning of the end. A. E. Waite and a group of his followers seceded in 1903, objecting to occultism and saying that they must work on purely mystical lines. Yeats, Wynn Westeott, and Arthur Machen resigned in 1905; Florence Farr died. In 1905 Crowley broke with Mathers and in 1907 founded his own Order of the A. A. or Silver Star. Various splinter-groups survived for a while; but the First World War swept away, among many other lost illusions, the enchant ment out of which had arisen the Order of the Golden Dawn Outer, the Roseae Ruheae and the Aureae Crucis. During the seven years of his membership in the order Yeats laid the foundation of the spiritual knowledge and the system which is the rock upon which all his subsequent work is built; a learning of the imagination not taught in the schools, but com prising the gnostic, hermetic, neoplatonic, and alchemical tradi tions. G. R. S. Meade, A. E. Waite, and other fine scholars were at that time editing, under the direct or indirect auspices of the Theosophical Society, the principal texts of western tradition. In "All Souls' Night", written more than twenty years after, Yeats summons in a ritual he had perhaps performed in their living com pany, his companions of the Order?Horton, the artist, Florence Farr, and MacGregor himself. These ghosts would understand the poet's "mummy truths", "whereat the living mock", for they had been initiated, in life, into the mysteries of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Magic was only one of the subjects to which the neo phyte of the Golden Dawn aspired when he swore "to prosecute the Great Work: which is to obtain control of the nature and power of my own being". According to some of the texts (dating, however, from a later period, and doubtless under Waite's influence) the purpose was even more specifically Chris tian: "To establish closer and more personal relations with the Lord Jesus, the Master of Masters, is and ever must be the ulti</page><page sequence="7">118 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN mate object of all the teachings of our Order."2 Yeats, writing for once for those who shared his own knowledge and beliefs, in the pamphlet published under the signature D. E. D. I. (a de fence of the system of examinations which Waite and his sup porters wished to abolish) and entitled Is the Order of R. R. and A.C. to Remain a Magical Order? ^ wrote that . . . the passing by their means from one degree to another is an evocation of the Supreme Life, a treading of a symbolic ^n the question of the degree to which the Society was Christian the experts differ. Mr. Geoffrey Watkins believes that it was strongly so from the first; Mr. Gerald Yorke that A. E. Waite, who rewrote the ritual extensively when he broke away from the original Order, was mainly responsible for the Christianization. "Where the G. D. called itself a Hermetic Order, Waite called his version a Rosicrucian Order, and the Rosicrucians were always more Christian than the Hermetists. In the original G. D. the Christianised Rosicrucian material did not come until the 5=6 degree in the Inner Order. Here for the first time you find the Calvary cross, but with a rose on it instead of the figure of Christ." This I quote from a letter from Mr. Yorke; who further writes: "Now Hermetic Orders as such are only Christian in that they include some Christianity but do not stress it. Rosicrucian orders on the other hand are primarily Christian but draw on other pre-Christian sources. In other words the Hermetists always try to become God in his anthropomorphic or in some instances theriomorphic form. They inflame themselves with prayer until they become Adonai the Lord . . . whereas the Christian approached God the Father through Christ (Adonai) but never tried to become Christ, only to become as Christ. Thus the Hermetic (or pagan) approach is as Adonai to order the averse hierarchy about, the Rosicrucian approach is to order them about through the grace of Christ or through the power of His name. . . . Now the G. D. used the pagan formulae, the Hermetic formulae and the pre- or non-Christian names of power, taken from Hebrew, Greek, Coptic, and Egyptian sources. The Rosicrucian substitutes names from the Christian system, from the Christian Trinity, etc. Both systems combine when it comes to the archangels Gabriel, Auriel, Michael and Raphael. They also agree on the Cherubim, Seraphim, etc. The G. D. way of becoming the god is the dangerous one, as it leads at once to inflated ego, witness Mathers and Crowley et al. The occult orders are full mostly of people who are for the time being in revolt against or not at home with Christianity. When they find that the occult, Hermetic pre Christian way of doing things at its best is no better than the Christian way, they often find their final home back in Christianity or in Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism. For the major religions are major because they have stood the test of time better. "Thus my conclusion is that the Hermetic way of the G. D. is primarily Hermetic and not Christian, since it is reverting to pre-Christian methods and attitudes, but some of the members will have done it all in a Christian way. I am fairly certain that these were in a minority at any given moment and seldom remained in the Order all their lives. But this of course is a personal opinion." I quote this valuable opinion of Mr. Yorke for the light it throws on the imponder ables of an ambiance, an emphasis, within an Order at best ambiguous. Mr. Watkins's view of the predominance of the Christian emphasis may be founded upon the fact that two of the founder-members (not Mathers) were members of the English Rosicrucian Order. As regards Yeats, we must be left wondering, as Thomas Butts wondered about Blake, whether his angels were black, white, or grav: but the colour o? the ane?is themselves may perhaos lie in the eve of the beholder. In any case, from a Catholic point of view the Order of the G. D. would stand condemned if only on the grounds of the vow of secrecy imposed upon its members.</page><page sequence="8">KATHLEEN RAINE 119 path, a passage through a symbolic gate, a climbing towards the light which it is the essence of our system to believe flows continually from the lowest of the invisible Degrees to the highest of the Degrees that are known to us. It mat ters nothing whether the Degrees above us are in the body or out of the body, for none the less must we tread this path, and open this gate, and seek this light and none the less must we believe the light flows downward con tinually. . . . And later in the same pamphlet: ... It is by sorrow and labour, by love of all living things, and by a heart that humbles itself before the Ancestral light, and by a mind its power and beauty and quiet flow through without end, that men come to Adeptship and not by the multiplication of petty formulae. Yeats is here speaking with a simplicity impossible to him in the common, or indeed in the literary, world in which he moved: only among the like-minded could he speak with complete open ness of the things nearest his heart. The central teaching of the Golden Dawn was Cabbalism (especially the Christian Cabbalism of Dee and Agrippa), with its numerology and complex system of correspondences based on the diagram of the Tree of Life; the Tarot was used in this sense, according to L?vi's view that these cards represent the Tree of Life in pictorial form. Yeats in The Trembling of the Veil writes of that symbol with which he was himself so familiar: "The Tree of Life is a geometrical figure made up of ttn circles or spheres called Sephiroth joined by straight lines. Once men must have thought of it as like some great tree covered with its fruit and foliage, but at some period, in the thirteenth century, perhaps, touched by the mathematical genius of Arabia in all likelihood, it had lost its natural form." The divine energy flows continually from the uncreated source through the ten di</page><page sequence="9">120 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN vine names, numerations, or powers, emanating from force into form throughout the four worlds of Aziluth (the world of deity), Briah (the world of creation), Yetzirah (the world of formation), and Assiah (the world of action). These four worlds correspond to the Platonic traditional hierarchy of the exemplary or archetypal world, the intellectual, celestial, and elemental worlds. These terms were used by Agrippa and other authorities whose works were studied by the G. D. Blake's four worlds of Eden, Beulah, Generation, and Ulro derive from the same tra dition. Yeats restores to the tree its foliage in an early poem, "The Two Trees", when he writes of The flaming circle of our days, Gyring, spiring to and fro In those great ignorant leafy ways. . . . The Tree is repeated and reflected in every created being; Yeats somewhere writes of spirits with mirrors in their breasts: Beloved, gaze in thine own heart, The holy tree is growing there .... The Holy Tree casts its image even in the world cut off from God: In the dim glass the demons hold, The glass of outer weariness .... Those "straight lines" which join the Sephiroth are twenty two in number and correspond to the letters of the Hebrew alpha bet. Thus the symbolic structure of the Tree resolves itself into the numbers four, ten, and twenty-two. The Tarot pack also consists of four suits each of ten numbered cards, and four court cards; and the twenty-two trumps or keys, whose symbols are so haunting and evocative. The numbers one to ten correspond</page><page sequence="10">KATHLEEN RAINE 121 to the Sephiroth and each of the suits corresponds to one of the four elements and the four worlds. The twenty-two Tarot trumps are assigned each to one of the twenty-two paths by which "the Way of the Serpent" goes "gyring, spiring to and fro" among the Sephiroth. Even allowing for the tendency of all the magical systems to relate everything with everything else?letters with numbers, with cycles of months, years, and the signs of the zodiac, with parts of the body, celestial and infernal hierarchies of angels, with minerals, metals, plants, animals, and whatever else may be con tained in the whole of manifested being?we see that there are many possible correlations between the Tarot and the diagram matical Tree. These correlations, by which the qualitative as pects of being may be explored, are at once complex and exact. One of the most striking?and to the novice surprising?features of magic is its meticulous precision. One of the instructions given to the Golden Dawn initiates is: "Above all things in everything occult we must earnestly beseech you to cultivate the greatest pos sible exactness. Every word should be accurately learned, every symbol accurately drawn." Whatever else the study of magic may be, it is a rigorous discipline of all the faculties of the human mind. Yeats, when he became a member of the Golden Dawn, was al ready a student of Blake, and familiar therefore with the Four Zoas, of reason, passion, prophetic imagination, and sensory life? well known to us since, through the writings of Jung, as the four functions of the psyche. Blake himself refers his Zoas to the four Living Creatures of Ezekiel's vision; and Eliphas L?vi makes a similar attribution of the four Tarot suits. This can be seen in an emblem of the Cherub of Ezekiel, prefaced to West cott's The Magical Ritual of the Sanctum Regnum. In this em blem, the faces and wings of the Cherub are related to the ten Sephiroth, while four hands carry cup, wand, sword, and pentacle. These four recur in the ritual of the Golden Dawn as the four</page><page sequence="11">122 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN elemental weapons of the magician: the lotus-headed wand of fire, the cup of water, the dagger for air, and the pentacle for earth. Every adept had to make for himself, according to pre cise directions, these four weapons for the evocation and control of those elements and aspects of the universe to which each corre sponds; and, in addition, to consecrate a sword. "The consecrated blade upon my knees/Is Sato's blade . . ." no doubt refers to this rite of consecration. Yeats in his stories of Red Hanrahan makes an association be tween a magical pack of cards and the four sacred objects of Irish mythology. He dreamed of founding a magical Order with a ritual appropriate to Ireland; and this story suggests per haps one symbolic substitution which might have been made had he done so. Indeed, the figure of Hanrahan himself seems re lated to the Tarot card Le Mat, the fool, the zero of the pack, to whom no number is assigned?perhaps the motley-clad Joker of the familiar deck of playing cards. The neophyte of the Order of the Golden Dawn was assigned the number 0 = 0, which by implication identifies the uninitiated man with the Tarot's Fool. He carries a wallet and a staff, his clothes are ragged, and a dog or other animal is attacking him from behind. In the traditional Marseilles and Italian packs the Fool is represented as a dull stupid figure; in other variations he is the court jester with cap, bells, and motley. In Waite's pack the Foolish Man is repre sented as a dreamer, who, about to step over the precipice of the world, carries a white rose in his hand. His countenance is full of intelligence and expectant dream. He has a rose in one hand and in the other a costly wand, from which depends over his right shoulder a wallet curi ously embroidered. He is a prince of the other world on his travels through this one. . . . He signifies the journey abroad, the state of the first emanation, the graces and passivity of the spirit. His wallet is inscribed with dim signs, to show that many sub-conscious memories are stored up in his soul.</page><page sequence="12">KATHLEEN RAINE 123 He is everyman, born into the world "not in entire forgetfulness", who must make the journey of the thirty-two paths. He is, ac cording to Aleister Crowley, "the initial nothing" who must make his way to "the terminal all", the twenty-first key, called The Universe. And I myself created Hanrahan And drove him drunk or sober through the dawn From somewhere in the neighbouring cottages. Caught by an old man's juggleries He stumbled, tumbled, fumbled to and fro And had but broken knees for hire And horrible splendour of desire; I thought it all out twenty years ago: Good fellows shuffled cards in an old bawn; And when that ancient ruffian's turn was on He so bewitched the cards under his thumb That all but the one card became A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards, And that he changed into a hare. Hanrahan rose in frenzy there And followed up those baying creatures towards? O towards I have forgotten what?enough! The purposeful "towards", followed by forgetfulness, expresses the amnesia of the generated soul who has forgotten eternity and the destination of the pilgrimage of life; and who, like Han rahan, stumbles, tumbles, fumbles to and fro on the journey back to that other world where he is a prince. Perhaps it is the magician?the first card or key of the Tarot trumps?who dealt the magic pack as he "muttered to himself as he turned the cards, Spades and Diamonds, Courage and Power; Clubs and Hearts, Knowledge and Pleasure". The Juggler or Magician of the Tarot is depicted with the four magical instruments on a table before him?cup, wand, sword,</page><page sequence="13">124 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN and pentacle; signifying, according to Waite, "the elements of natural life, which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills". Bewitched on the night of the full moon, Hanrahan, when the juggler set the hounds after the hare, "went stumbling out of the door like a maniac, and the door shut after him as he went". If we are right in believing that Hanrahan is, like the Unwise Man, the "first emanation", the soul who leaves eternity for the journey of time, the door that shut after him as he went might seem to signify the irrevocability of birth into this world. When the fairy hounds vanish into the air, Hanrahan falls asleep and is led by an old man into a visionary world. There he sees "sitting in a high chair a woman, the most beautiful the world ever saw, having a long pale face and flowers about it". "And there sitting on the step below her chair four gray old women, and the one of them was holding a great cauldron in her lap; and another a great stone on her knees, and heavy as it was it seemed light to her; and another of them had a very long spear that was made of pointed wood; and the last of them had a sword that was without a scabbard". The old women offer the four objects in turn to Hanrahan; but, like the knight in the Mabinogion who does not ask the mean ing of spear and grail, Hanrahan chooses none, and presently is overcome once more with the irresistible sleep of forgetfulness. The figure of the wandering fool appears again and again in Yeats's poems and mythologies, as the Fool by the Roadside, Crazy Jane and Tom the Lunatic, or that statesman who is Yeats himself, and who exchanges the illusion of permanence, security, and identity for the blind pilgrimage which is everyman's destiny, and therefore in some sense sacred: With boys and girls about him, With anv sort of clothes, With a hat out of fashion, With old patched shoes,</page><page sequence="14">KATHLEEN RAINE 125 With a ragged bandit cloak, With an eye like a hawk, With a stiff straight back, With a strutting turkey walk, With a bag full of pennies, With a monkey on a chain, With a great cock's feather, With an old foul tune. Each image here suggests the wanderer of the Tarot with his rags and his wallet; even perhaps the attendant animal, "a monkey on a chain", a symbol of man's chattering, fickle mind, no less apt than the dog, tiger, or crocodile, who in various ver sions of the Tarot signify the lusts which are the travelling com panions of man on his journey. This journey may be understood as relating to this present life, or to many lives; and Yeats would have understood the symbol in both senses, since rebirth is assumed in all his thought from first to last. We see therefore in the fool's journey a fore shadowing of the Phases of the Moon, in which the soul travels the circuit of the Wheel of Fortune. Yeats had early under stood that man's only abiding identity is that of the pilgrim of eternity, the zero: I see my life go drifting like a river From change to change; I have been many things? A green drop in the surge, a gleam of light Upon a sword, a fir-tree on a hill, An old slave grinding at a heavy quern, A king sitting upon a chair of gold? And all these things were wonderful and great; But now I have grown nothing, knowing all. The successive incarnations of Fergus the King remind us of the traditional incarnations by which the Buddha rises from the lowest forms of life to the highest, and so to release. The con cept of the Wheel of the hells and the heavens through which</page><page sequence="15">126 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN all souls must travel is most highly developed in Buddhism, but it is common, in some form, to all religions. Dante's ascent of the Mountain from the hells, through purgatory, to the heavens, is a Christian equivalent of the Buddhist Wheel, as are Sweden borg's and Blake's "twenty-seven churches". To the same sym bol we must assign the "gyring, spiring" "Way of the Serpent", which in the Cabbalistic Tree of Life passes in succession through the mansions or stations of the twenty-two paths of the Tarot. To quote Blake: "These States Exist now. Man Passes on, but States remain for Ever; he passes thro' them like a traveller who may as well suppose that the places he has pass'd through Exist no more?Everything is Eternal." The spires of that Serpent must certainly be one among the many sources of Yeats's image of the Wheel as not a circular but a spiral revolution (the gyres). According to Mathers the twenty-two Tarot trumps will give, taken in order of their numbers, a connected sentence, or story, which is capable of being read thus: "The Human Will (the Juggler or Magician) enlightened by Science (the High Priest ess) and manifested by Action (the Empress) should find its Realization (the Emperor) in deeds of Mercy and Beneficence (the Pope). The Wise Dispensation (the Lovers) of this will give him Victory (the Chariot) through Equilibrium (Justice) and Prudence (the Hermit) over the fluctuations of Fortune (the Wheel of Fortune). Fortitude (the eleventh trump) sanctified by Sacrifice of Self (the Hanged Man) will triumph over Death Itself (the thirteenth card) and thus a wise Combination (Tem perance) will enable him to defy Fate (the Devil). In each Mis fortune (the lightning-struck Tower) he will see the star of Hofe (key number seventeen) shine through the twilight of Deception (the Moon): and ultimate Haffiness (the Sun) will be the Re sult (the Last Judgement). Folly (the card of the foolish man) will on the other hand bring about an evil Reward (the Uni verse)." Eliphas L?vi gives another arrangement, even closer to Yeats's</page><page sequence="16">KATHLEEN RAINE 127 own phases of the moon; for he assigns the twenty-eight days of the moon to the twenty-two Tarot keys and the seven planets? twenty-eight in all (since the Fool counts as zero). I have been unable to find any exact correspondence between L?vi's phases of the moon and Yeats's unless L?vi's last three, Luna, Sol and the Fool, correspond to Yeats's "hunchback, Saint and Fool"?per haps the "hunchback" is the "man in the moon" with his bundle of faggots on his back. Yeats was not following in an exact way either Mathers or L?vi, but the type of arrangement, so bewilder ing to his readers, was one familiar to him in many forms, as a path or wheel, or a path running round a wheel, or a spiral path. That diagrammatic arrangement of experience which Jung calls the m?ndala recurs again and again in the esoteric tradition. Papus for example (the pseudonym for G?rard Encausse), whose work The Tarot of the Bohemians was translated into English by Waite, correlates the Tarot with the twenty-two constellations with their fine Yeats-like names?the Virgin, Hercules, Eagle, Sagittarius, Ox-driver, Lion, Balance, Dragon of the Pole, and the rest?names which are themselves a record and witness of that abiding human instinct to project upon the universe of the macrocosm the archetypal configurations of the soul. // In the initiatory ceremonies of the Order, the various Tarot keys were used. The second grade led the Zelator into the first path, that of the twenty-second trump, the Universe, assigned to the path that leads from Malkuth (the lowest point on the Tree) to Yesod. There followed the grade of Practicus, with the Tarot keys of the Last Judgment, and the Sun; at this stage the title of Mono cero s de Astris was conferred. In the rite of initiation into the fourth grade, the symbolism is that of water, and the Tarot key the Moon; figures wearing the masks of Osiris, Isis, and Horus speak, and the symbols of the card are expounded at length.</page><page sequence="17">128 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN The moon described and, above all, evoked in this ceremony bears little relation to earth's arid satellite upon which the d?bris of modern technology is already accumulating. It is nonetheless real for it is the moon of human and pre-human experience count less times repeated, the moon of the changing eyes of the cat, the qualitative moon, one of those "moods" which belong less to the individual than to the collective mind, and which can there be evoked as an experience of our inherited rather than of our indi vidual humanity. The incantatory style of the rituals is determined by their evocative purpose: "The priest with the mask of Osiris spake and said: I am the water stagnant and silent and still; reflecting all, concealing all, I am the Past, I am the Inundation. He who rises from the Great Waters is my Name"?and so on. We may recall countless examples from the sacred writings of all races and periods in which supernatural beings declare themselves, making themselves known to human consciousness from some region beyond. In many folk-tales the hero must ask the name and the nature, so obtaining power over some supernatural power. Un deniably there is a kind of poetry whose purpose and whose means are the same; and none knew better than did Yeats how to "hail the superhuman". Yeats is known to have helped Mathers in the writing of the Golden Dawn rituals and ceremonies of initiation, which owe much to the Egyptian Book of the Deady the Chaldean Oracles, and Blake's Prophetic Books. Only Yeats could have written a passage so full of paraphrased Blake as this: And Tetragrammaton placed Kerubim at the East of the border of Eden and a Flaming Sword which turned every way to keep the path of the Tree of Life, for He had created Nature that man being cast out of Eden may not fall into the Void. He has bound man with the stars as with a chain. He allures him with the scattered fragments of the Divine Body in bird and beast and flower. And he laments over</page><page sequence="18">KATHLEEN RAINE 129 him in the Wind and in the Sea and in the Birds, And when the times are ended He will call the Kerubim from the East of the border, and all shall be consumed and be come infinite and holy. The last phrase is taken almost verbatim from "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"; the chain of stars is from Vala. Thus were the stars of heaven created like a golden chain To bind the Body of Man to heaven from falling into the Abyss. For the rest, the passage is a paraphrase of the beautiful speech of Enion at the end of Vala Night the Eighth. Blake had in this passage himself drawn upon the alchemical tradition of the deus absconditus. In the ritual of the Golden Dawn the gather ing of the fragments of the Divine Body comes back full circle into a ritual in which Osiris, prototype of all dismembered gods, is evoked anew. Ellis and Yeats believed that Blake had himself been a Rosicrucian initiate; whether or not this was so they rightly believed that they were themselves within the same tra dition as that from which Blake had gained his knowledge and derived his symbols. The rituals and ceremonies, with their figures of the Egyptian gods Horus, Osiris, and Isis, who speak through masks as from some superhuman state of being and knowledge, bear a striking resemblance, in this respect, to Yeats's "drama of the soul". The idea that in religious ceremonial the gods themselves speak from a superhuman world is old and universal, but at the end of the nineteenth century the concept of the oracular was as absent from poetry as it was from religion, and for the same reason: the conception of a collective unconscious, of "personifying spirits" who speak with cosmic voices from "the age-long memoried self" of anima mundi, was unknown to all but a few theosophists and students of the Hermetic tradition, who have since proved to be the forerunners of a rediscovery of those gods which William 9</page><page sequence="19">130 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN Blake, a century before, had discovered as the residents of "the human breast". Yeats and his fellow-students of the Hermetic tradition unsealed fountains which had long been hidden. "The blessed spirits," Yeats wrote in A Vision^ "must be sought within the self which is common to all"; and to Florence Farr he had written, many years before, in a postscript to the address to the Hermetic Order already quoted, "Individuality is not as im portant as our age has imagined." The gods are figures of the collective consciousness. Writing in aHodos Chameleontosyy of his association with "some experimental circle" (evidently the Golden Dawn), Yeats asks a question that Jung and others later were to ask?"how trust historian and psychologist who have for three hundred years ignored in writing the history of the world, or of the human mind, so momentous a part of human experience?"; "I had even created a dogma: because those imaginary people are created out of the deepest instinct of man, to be his measure and his norm, whatever I can imagine those mouths speaking may be the nearest I can go to truth." These are the archetypes whose evocation was the object of the symbolic ritual of the Golden Dawn. For Yeats magic was not so much a kind of poetry, as poetry was a kind of magic, and the object of both alike was evocation of energies and knowledge from beyond normal consciousness. "Symbols and formulae," he wrote to Florence Farr, "are powers, which act in their own right and with little consideration for our intentions, however excellent. Most of us have seen some cere mony produce an altogether unintended result because of the accidental use of some wrong formula or symbol." The literalness with which Yeats believed that symbolic forms, or even symbolic sounds, have this evocative power is proved by the statement by Ellis and Yeats in their work on Blake that "the writers of this book have summoned the great symbolic beings? Ololon, Urthona, Ore, and others?into the imaginations of en tranced subjects by merely pronouncing and making them pro nounce the words."</page><page sequence="20">KATHLEEN RAINE 131 Yeats calls these "personifying spirits" Moods and also Gate Keepers, a term which may seem strange if we overlook the allu sion to their initiatory character, as given in these rites, them selves based upon instructions given in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, to the soul who must pass in turn the gods who guard the gates of the Underworld, or of the Collective Unconscious, which is perhaps the same thing. "There are, indeed, personifying spirits that we had best call but Gates and Gate-Keepers, because through their dramatic power they bring our soul to crisis." Yeats himself relates these figures to their Egyptian origin when he writes: "The masks of tragedy contain neither character nor personal energy. They are allied to decoration and to the ab stract figures of Egyptian Temples. Before the mind can look out of their eyes the active will perishes, hence their sorrowful calm." He was speaking as an initiate. Time drops in decay, Like a candle burnt out, And the mountains and woods Have their day, have their day; What one in the rout Of the fire-born moods Has fallen away? To those realists who find symbolist art lacking in "humanity" (whatever that means to them) the initiate can but reply that the archetypal world of symbolic images is the form of our collec tive humanity; the symbolist poet is always addressing us at the level of that universal human experience of which every indi vidual life is at best a partial and imperfect expression. Through identification with that world we are able to participate in that cosmic whole which lends dignity and meaning to even its most insignificant parts, each of which reflects the whole in that "mirror in the heart" of which Yeats has written, as in a microcosm. Of that archetypal order the Tarot is a full and effective formula</page><page sequence="21">132 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN tion, valid even?perhaps especially?at a time when mythologies are a dead language. The archetypes?if we encounter them at all?are likely to appear as figures mysterious and nameless, belonging to no pantheon, no theological system. The Tarot symbols gave to the members of the Golden Dawn the freedom to evoke, in their living essence, those personifying spirits which by different nations have been variously named. To the poet especially this freedom is essential?freedom to clothe the Moods in the dress of history, of locality, of dreams, of learned mythol ogies, or?as with Yeats above all?with all these together. Eclecticism may be bad for theology but it is indispensable to poetry. Yet the incantatory style of the Magus is most perilously poised on the knife-edge which divides the sublime from the ridiculous; and there is no denying that the hieratic style of Yeats, both at its best and and at its worst, is like nothing so much as this magical ritual, woven of strands from the Egyptian Book of the Deady the Chaldean Oracles, those grandiose voices we some times hear in dreams, or truths "out of a medium's mouth". In an unsympathetic mood we might see in the turgid style of Yeats's b?te noir Aleister Crowley a caricature of Yeats's own. Indeed, between these two magicians there is the similarity of man and shadow; Crowley, the more talented magician, if reports of his misdoings are to be believed, wrote many volumes of bad verse and resented Yeats's poor opinion of it. Yeats must on his side have resented the distortion of all that to him was sacred, in the priapic rites of the "Great Beast" (Master Therion). The Mathers ritual is, by comparison, restrained and scholarly; Crowley's concern was sensationalism. He had his own "evil" Tarot, executed according to his instructions by Frieda Harris, in marked contrast with the rather insipid art nouveau of Pamela Coleman-Smith's designs. Crowley claimed that his Book of Thoth is the only symbolically complete and authentic Tarot; but it seems likely that it contains some purely personal interpreta</page><page sequence="22">KATHLEEN RAINE 133 tions; his statement, for example, that key number eight?Forti tude?is "Lust" seems on the face of it unlikely! Crowley believed himself to be a prophet of Antichrist, under the sign of the Apocalyptic "Great Beast" (Master Therion) and the number 666. Was he an aspect of Yeats's "rough beast, its hour come round at last" that "slouches towards Bethlehem to be born"? Yeats cannot have been unaware of his b?te noires new Satanic cult, "Thelema". And did Yeats himself, in some of his latest poems with their priapic themes and implicit "sex-magic", adopt certain of Crowley's views on the holiness of what in the Christian era has been deemed unholy? Crowley was in his way a prophet, and sometimes an eloquent one, often in a sense complementary (or antithetical) to Yeats himself. In Yeats's prophetic lines from The Resurrection: Another Troy must rise and set, Another lineage feed the crow, Another Argo's painted prow Drive to a flashier bauble yet is there a more than coincidental echo (besides Shelley's Hellas) of Crowley's Liber Legist "Another prophet shall arise, and bring fresh fever from the skies;/another woman shall awake the lust and worship of the Snake :/another soul of God and beast shall mingle in the globed priest;/another sacrifice shall stain the tomb. . . ." In Crowley's comment on the seventeenth Tarot trump (the Star) there is a passage strangely reminiscent of Yeats's image in "The Second Coming", of the falcon "Turning and turning in the widening gyre". "It will be seen" (Crowley writes) "that every form of energy in this picture is a spiral. Zoroaster says 'God is he, having the head of a hawk; having a spiral force.' It is interesting to notice that this oracle appears to anticipate the present Aeon, that of the hawk-headed Lord, and also of the mathematical conception of the shape of the Universe as calcu</page><page sequence="23">134 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN lated by Einstein and his school." Whether or not Master Therion had a part in the inspiration of the poem, Yeats and Crowley drew upon a common fund of esoteric tradition and shared a belief that a Second Coming is at hand. Both write of the ending of one Great Year, and of the advent of an antithetical phase; but whereas Crowley placed himself in the service of Anti christ, "the savage God" of the new cycle, Yeats's fidelity was to "the old king", to "that unfashionable gyre" the values about to be obscured, to the "workman, noble and saint" of Christian civilization. Yeats tells in his Autobiographies how he himself invoked the spirit of the moon. He tells how he made the invocation "after night just before I went to bed, and after many nights?eight or nine perhaps?I saw between sleeping and waking, as in a cinematograph, a galloping centaur, and a moment later a woman of incredible beauty, standing upon a pedestal and shooting an arrow at a star." He did not use these images in any poem until twenty or twenty-five years later; but the experience seems to have been one of those unforgettable openings of a visionary world which poets remember and draw upon for a lifetime. It is necessary again to remember that no reading of the score of sym bolic forms can enable us to hear the music. It is one thing to know of, another to know, the anima mundi. Magic is, above all, an evocation of the numinous; and whether in dream, in vision, or in ritual invocation, the experience itself is its own mode of knowledge and the keys are used only in order to awaken their sleeping counterparts in the mind. In his essay on Anima Mundi Yeats writes that he "was seldom delighted by that sudden lumi nous definition of form which makes one understand almost in spite of oneself that one is not merely imagining". Edwin Muir, who never in his life made a magical invocation, describes in his autobiography, The Story cmd the Fable, how he too was "over whelmed by miracle" and flung into a world where "the dragon and the Sphinx seemed to be completely self-created; so far as</page><page sequence="24">KATHLEEN RAINE 135 I know there was no subject-matter in my mind from which I could have fashioned them. And the whole atmosphere of the dream was strange and astonishing: its exhilarating speed, its objective glory, above all its complete lack of all that is usually meant by human." That such visions come not from the personal but from the collective unconscious seems confirmed by what Yeats tells of a series of what would by some be called coincidences, by the Sur realists the operation of "pananoia", by Jung the unknown laws of "synchronicity". Several friends gave Yeats related symbols, from dream or literature: Arthur Symons a poem of his own describing a similar goddess-figure, and a story by Fiona Mac leod entitled The Archer: "Someone in the story had a vision of a woman shooting an arrow into the sky and later of an arrow shot at a fawn that pierced the fawn's body and remained, the fawn's heart torn out and clinging to it, embedded in a tree." The child of a friend dreamed of a woman shooting an arrow into the sky which "killed God"; and in another dream, a star is shot by an arrow; later the star was seen "lying in a cradle". The apparent objectivity of such visions?Edwin Muir wrote, "It was not CV who dreamt it but something else which the psychologists call the racial unconscious and which has other names"?makes explicable Yeats's method of dealing with all these related symbols as an archaeologist might piece together the fragments of a broken statue. He regards the whole constellation of symbols as an objective reality, in its own world. He set out to discover more about the mythological antecedents of each ele ment?the Child and the Tree, the Woman who shot the Arrow, the Heart torn out, the Star, the Centaur, and the constellations Sagitta and Sagittarius; the learned sources from which he gathered examples from folklore and mythology are given in notes to the Autobiographies. He also took his vision with its related svmbols to "a London coroner learned in the Cabbala"? Wynn Westcott: "he opened a drawer and took out of it two</page><page sequence="25">136 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN water-colour paintings . . . one was of a centaur, the other of a woman standing on a stone pedestal and shooting an arrow at what seemed a star. He asked me to look carefully at the Star, and I saw that it was a little golden heart." Westcott told him that these symbols belonged to a part of the Christian Cabbala unknown to Yeats, and related the centaur and the woman to one of the paths of the Tree, and the heart to the Sephira Tipher eth. Yeats does not say?though he must have known it?that the Tarot key to this path, which ascends from Yesod to Tipher eth, is No. 14 (Temperance) : a winged robed female figure with a sun or star symbol on her brow. The Tarot key of the Star (No. 17) is a somewhat similar female figure, but nude, who is, according to L?vi, "the psyche of the world'*?Anima Mundi herself. Only some thirty years later did these symbols, long pondered, appear in Yeats's poetry. At the time of the experience Yeats had asked himself, "Had some great event taken place in some world where myth is reality and had we seen a portion of it?" When later he used symbols which had for him a sacred significance, it was in this sense that he used them. The play The Resurrection was written to formulate certain traditional teachings on the Great Year, and to express, in terms of the Orphic theology and the myth of Dionysus, the esoteric doctrine that the Christian revela tion signified the beginning of a cycle now approaching its end, and the possibility that the antithetical cycle is about to begin. Was that vision of the virgin and the star slain and reborn, per ceived by more than one mind and not long before the First World War, a sign of that impending revolution? In the passage from Aleister Crowley above, the Tarot key of the Star was as sociated with the spiral gyre and with the ascending falcon, sym bols which had for Yeats such profound significance in his thought upon the theme of historical cycles which dominated his poetic vision. I have written elsewhere of the traditional mythology to which</page><page sequence="26">KATHLEEN RAINE 137 Yeats in the choruses of The Resurrection strictly adheres, and of its relation to Blake's poem on the historic cycles, "The Mental Traveller". Here I wish only to add that Yeats, who had pondered his own vision for half a lifetime, was writing of an ancient myth with the authority of one who had himself seen the mysteries, had seen the slaying of the god, the torn-out heart. There is only one symbol in these choruses which apparently re lates only to the dream material and not to the Orphic or some other mythology; the star itself, in the line . . . that fierce virgin and her Star. . . . The symbolic tradition to which the star belongs is that of the Tarot, and Yeats, following his practice and his vows of silence, does not disclose this source. The arrow, on the other hand, is absent; the Child Dionysus was slain by the tearing out of his heart, not by an arrow. But there is another dying god?a myth ological synonym, so to say, of Dionysus?in whose myth the arrow appears; and Yeats had noted at this time the myth of Balder, slain by the arrow of mistletoe. The "way of the arrow" on the Tree of Life is the direct way of ascent, by sacrifice, which goes up the center of the Tree and not by the "gyring, spiring" way of the Serpent. Upon this di rect path of ascent, from Malkuth to Kether, is the Sephira Tiphereth, the potency to which are assigned all those dying gods of whom Dionysus, Attis, and Balder are types. In "The Phases of the Moon", whose theme is the Wheel of Fortune, or rebirth, the journey through the States, Yeats names this direct way of re lease from the wheel: The burning bow that once could shoot an arrow Out of the up and down, the wagon-wheel Of beauty's cruelty and wisdom's chatter. . . . These various sacrificial figures are comprised, in the Tarot,</page><page sequence="27">138 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN under the symbol of the Hanged Man. The Tarot card of the Hanged Man is not another Dying God, but may be taken to represent, in a particular aspect, all those myths of sacrifice. The Hanged Man is suspended by his foot between two trees (in the Marseilles pack) or on the cross-tree of a Tau cross (in Waite's pack). Waite's card shows the head of the martyred figure surrounded by a nimbus; and he says that the card is related to the mystery of death and resurrection, and to "the relation, in one of its aspects, between the divine and the Universe". This aspect seems to include the descent (head downwards, as we are born) of the divine into generation, as in the myths of Dionysus and the rest; and the martyrdom of the divine principle upon the Tree of creation, whose roots are above, in the divine mystery, and whose branches below. The Dying God on the Tree was a symbol to which Frazer's Golden Bough had lent new meaning and richness in the last decade of the nineteenth century. The priest of the woods of Nemi who guarded the sacred tree, and himself personified the tree-god, is the starting-point of that wide-ranging exploration of folklore and primitive religion that made Frazer's generation aware of the continuity and universality of the basic themes which underlie a multitude of myths. When Yeats chose the figure of Attis, in the poem "Vacillation", as the Dying God on the Tree, his principal source was no doubt Frazer; the Tree upon which he hangs is of course the Tree of Life, enriched with all its multiple Cabbalistic implications, and the figure is that of the Tarot Hanged Man: A tree there is that from its topmost bough Is half all glittering flame and half all green Abounding foliage moistened with the dew; And half is half and yet is all the scene; And half and half consume what they renew, And he that Attis' image hangs between That staring fury and the blind lush leaf May know not what he knows, but knows not grief.</page><page sequence="28">KATHLEEN RAINE 139 There are, of course, other elements in this poem: the Heracli tean fire of nature, parts kindling, parts going out; Blake's Tree of Nature, which consumes in flames at the end of time. Frazer describes Attis as a tree-spirit, and he is hung between the green leaf and the fire: "At the spring equinox a pine tree was cut in the woods and brought into the sanctuary of Cybele where it was treated as a divinity . . . and the effigy of a young man was affixed to the middle of the tree." At a later stage the effigy of the Dying God was solemnly burned: and "the fourth day [25th March] was the Festival of Joy (Hilaria) at which the resur rection of Attis was probably celebrated." At the end of a year the offering from the tree was burned. All or much of this symbolism is explicit or implicit in "Par nell's Funeral", the second poem in which Yeats draws upon the symbols constellated about the sacrificial figure of the Dying God in the Tree and about his own vision of the Star. By implication Parnell's sacrifice is identified with that of Dionysus, Attis, and the rest: Under the Great Comedian's tomb the crowd. A bundle of tempestuous cloud is blown About the sky; where that is clear of cloud Brightness remains; a brighter star shoots down; What shudders run through all that animal blood? What is this sacrifice? Can someone there Recall the Cretan barb that pierced a star? Rich foliage that the starlight glittered through, A frenzied crowd, and where the branches sprang A beautiful seated boy; a sacred bow; A woman and an arrow on a string; A pierced boy, image of a star laid low. That woman, the Great Mother imaging, Cut out his heart. Some master of design Stamped boy and tree upon Sicilian coin. In the myth of Dionysus it was Juno by whose command the heart of the god was torn out; it was preserved, as in the opening</page><page sequence="29">140 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN choruses of The Resurrection, by the "fierce virgin" Pallas Athe ne, who bore "that beating heart away" from whose life the god was reborn in a new cycle. Attis is similarly sacrificed to Cybele; and Yeats noted at the time of his vision Cretan coins of the fifth century B. C. which depict aspects of this myth. Yeats is think ing of the cannibalistic savagery of these ancient cults (so vividly described by Frazer) when he writes . . . popular rage, Hysterica passio dragged this quarry down. None shared our guilt; nor did we play a part Upon a painted stage when we devoured his heart. A letter from Yeats to Sturge Moore (September 6, 1921) is revealing in more ways than one. He is writing on the subject of a book-plate Moore was designing for him, and he is clearly thinking of the magical character of symbols when he writes: . . . don't nail the hawk on the board. The hawk is one of my symbols and you might rather crudely upset the sub consciousness. It might mean nightmare or something of the kind for some of us here. Life when one does my kind of work is rather strange. . . . My main symbols are Sun and Moon (in all phases), Tower, Mask, Tree (Tree with Mask hanging on the trunk) .... The Tree with the mask hanging on the trunk is clearly related to the Tarot key of the Hanged Man. To the Tower symbol we shall presently return. We may discover other hints of the Tarot cards: Those stilted boys, that burnished chariot, Lion and woman and the Lord knows what. The card of strength, or Fortitude (the eleventh key), shows a woman closing the mouth of a lion. The coach upon which Martin is working in The Unicorn from the Stars may be the</page><page sequence="30">KATHLEEN RAINE 141 Tarot Chariot, symbol of conquest on the external plane. Mar tin abandons his work on the glittering coach (which was to be sent to Dublin Castle for the use of the conquerors) as the result of a vision of the inner aspect of things. There are doubtless other instances; but I shall describe only one other symbol, or constellation of symbols. Is Michael Robartes the Hermit of the Tarot, the ninth key? Like the Fool, the Hermit is a traveller; but whereas the Fool stumbles and fumbles in ragged clothes, with the dogs after him, the Hermit is a venerable figure, bearing a lantern half-concealed in a fold of his cloak. In the other hand he carries the staff on which he leans, as if on a long journey. In Jungian terms he is the archetype of "the wise old man"; the same figure who as Shelley's Ahasuerus "dwells in a sea-cavern 'mid the Demonesi" and had captured Yeats's imagination and fired the "secret fanati cism" of his boyhood: Some feign that he is Enoch: others dream He was pre-Adamite, and has survived Cycles of generation and of ruin. The sage, in truth, by dreadful abstinence, And conquering penance of the mutinous flesh, Deep contemplation and unwearied study, In years outstretched beyond the date of man, May have attained to sovereignty and science Over those strong and secret things and thoughts, Which others fear and know not. Mathers's continued hold over Yeats's imagination helped to create, it may be, the figure of Robartes as the mysterious wander er in whose power it lies to appear to whom he pleases, or to sum mon to him those whom he wishes, in a manner which appears the work of chance but is in reality magical power. So the legendary Rosicrucians were imagined, by Fludd and by Vaughan, to make themselves known; and so in Rosa Alchemica Robartes knocks at the narrator's door in Dublin; brings to</page><page sequence="31">142 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN gether at the Caf? Royal the persons he needs for the communi cation of A Vision; and in "The Phases of the Moon" for a last time stands at the foot of the Tower, unsuspected by the philos opher at his books. The Society of the Golden Dawn presumed the existence of adepts, those magi "in the body or out of the body" in whose re ality Yeats, in the pamphlet which he wrote as Imperator of the Order, declared his belief. Mathers himself had, in that fantastic correspondence which resulted in his expulsion from the Order, based his claim to be its supreme head on the authority vested in him by these strange figures who continued to hold Yeats's imagi nation under a lifelong enchantment. "Every atom of the knowl edge of the Order has come through me alone," Mathers wrote; "it is I alone who have been and am in communication with the Secret Chiefs of the Order"; and in his manifesto declares that he has received instructions from the secret chiefs of the Order of the Rosy Cross, whose very names are unknown to him. We can catch, from Mathers's impassioned style, some glimmer of that enchantment which had held the young Yeats spellbound. When such a rendezvous has been in a much frequented place, there has been nothing in their personal appearance or dress to mark them out as differing in any way from ordi nary people except the appearance and sensation of transcend ent health and physical vigour (whether they seemed per sons in youth or age) which was their invariable accompani ment: in other words, the physical appearance which the possession of the Elixir of Life has traditionally been sup posed to confer. On the other hand, when the rendezvous has been a place free fom easy access by the Outer World they have usually been in symbolic robes and insignia.3 ^eats himself was far from credulous; in The Tragic Generation he discusses Mathers's visitations from the Masters: "He, like all that I have known who have given themselves up to images, and to the speech of images, thought that when he had proved that an image could act independently of his mind, he had proved also that neither it, nor what it had spoken, had originated there. Yet had I need of proof to the contrary, I had it while under his roof. I was eager for news of the</page><page sequence="32">KATHLEEN RAINE 143 Mathers wrote the manifesto from which this is taken in October, 1896; Rosa Alchemica, in which the figure of Robartes first appears, was written soon after. In A Vision, dictated to Mrs. Yeats through those same Instructors who had formerly used as their medium Vestigia (Mrs. Mathers), the figure of Michael Robartes reappears with a kind and degree of conviction which recalls that of Mathers half a lifetime before. ( Crowley's first wife and a succession of concubines also acted as his mediums in a similar way.) The figure of the unknown Rosicrucian had not faded for Yeats, but ripened with his own wisdom. The official who introduced the initiate in the ceremonies of the Golden Dawn bore as his insignia the lamp and staff of the Tarot Hermit, as perhaps had Mathers himself at Yeats's initia tion. In an early story it is Robartes who initiates the narrator into the Hermetic order of the Rosa Alchemica; the initiation takes place on a lonely rocky coast in the west of Ireland; and there indeed is the sea-cavern of the Demonesi, where "every mortal foot danced by the white foot of an immortal," and the poet himself danced with "an immortal august woman, who had black lilies in her hair". The narrator of Rosa Alchemica is not quite Yeats himself, for he flees magic to "carry the rosary about his neck". In that story Robartes is killed; but the archetypes are deathless, and he had to be, like the immortal Sherlock Holmes, resurrected, for Yeats had need of his instruction again when he wrote A Vision. The grand poem on "The Phases of the Moon" which prefaces A Vision brings Robartes, with his travelling companion Aherne, to the foot of the tower where the philosopher sits late; the same, we are to presume, who had refused his "strong and secret things and thoughts" in Rosa Alchemica. Spanish-American war, and went to the Rue Mozart before breakfast to buy a New York Herald. As I went out past the young Normandy servant who was laying breakfast, I was telling myself some schoolboy romance, and had just reached a place where I carried my arm in a sling after some remarkable escape. I bought my paper and returned, to find Mathers on the doorstep. 'Why, you are all right,' he said. 'What did the bonne mean by telling me that you had hurt your arm and carried it in a sling?' "</page><page sequence="33">144 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN The symbolic scene is set in the poem "The Phases of the Moon" for the poet's supreme statement of those undisclosed esoteric truths which had been the inspiration of his life's work. The speaker is Michael Robartes, a "master" in the sense in which H. P. Blavatsky and Mathers had understood the word. "For my part I believe them to be human and living upon the earth; but possessing terrible superhuman powers," Mathers had written. In any case Robartes possesses that "knowledge absolute" to which the philosopher in vain aspires. Aherne asks, . . . Why should not you Who know it all ring at his door, and speak Just truth enough to show that his whole life Will scarcely find for him a broken crust Of all those truths that are your daily bread; And when you have spoken take the roads again? The Tarot Hermit, symbol of initiatory "superhuman wisdom", like Shelley's Ahasuerus "as inaccessible as God", has come to the Tarot Tower, symbol of that "human wisdom" to which alone Socrates laid claim. The citadel of wisdom is one whose origins are lost in an tiquity; Alexandria's was a beacon-tower, and .... Babylon's An image of the moving heavens, a log book of the sun's journey and the moon's. . . . And Shelley had his towers, thought's crowned powers he called them once. . . . Yeats's tower is the same . . . where Milton's Platonist Sat late, or Shelley's visionary prince: The lonely light that Samuel Palmer engraved. . . . Seldom has a symbol passed through such a succession, in direct</page><page sequence="34">KATHLEEN RAINE 145 descent from Plato, through II Penseroso, to Yeats himself. Palmer too was a Platonist; and for Yeats, seeing on all sides the rise of ignorance, the most important thing was that one phi losopher should still keep watch in the High Lonely Tower. Wisdom, for Yeats, is essentially lonely, because for him wisdom is the esoteric knowledge of the initiate, possessed by few; and the custodians of truth become the more lonely as they ad vance in knowledge. In other societies than our own, on the presence of sage or hermit in his lonely cell the well-being of the many has been held to depend. Yeats knew this to be none the less true because few now believe it to be so, and in the pamphlet addressed to the Order of R. R. and A. C, already several times quoted, he wrote what he most deeply believed: The great Adept may indeed have to hide much of his deepest life, lest he tell it to the careless and the indifferent, but he will sorrow and not rejoice over this silence, for he will be always seeking ways of giving the purest substance of his soul to fill the emptiness of other souls. It will seem to him better that his soul be weakened, that he be kept wander ing on the earth even, than that other souls should lack any thing of strength and quiet. . . . He will remember, while he is with them, the old magical image of the pelican feeding its young with its own blood; and when, his sacrifice over, he goes his way to supreme Adeptship, he will go absolutely alone, for men attain to the supreme wisdom in a loneliness that is like the loneliness of death. In an earlier poem Yeats has with his Tower associated the scala coeli, "the winding ancient stair" of the ascent to Heaven, depicted by Blake in one of his greatest paintings. This is a symbol which in Ireland, land of high lonely monastic towers, could not fail to find a response. When Yeats wrote, "Is every modern nation like the tower,/ Half dead at the top?" the symbol is in contrast to those monastic bell-towers with their pointed roofs, and with Shelley's crowned 10</page><page sequence="35">146 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN towers of exalted thought; the top, like the summit of the Mountain of Paradise, being man's spirituality, that by which he is joined to what is above and beyond thought. Yet the Tower (in contrast with the Tree) is what man himself builds, and the prototype of all towers is Babel, type of all civilizations and systems that man has built or can ever build?the tower that falls into ruin before it can be completed. In "My Descendents" Yeats invokes the divine anger against succeeding generations if they should fall away from "thought's crowned powers": May this laborious stair and this stark tower Become a roofless ruin that the owl May build in the cracked masonry and cry Her desolation to the desolate sky. The owl?Athene's bird?comes by way of Milton and of Pal mer's engraving of II Penseroso, which gave Yeats also the "bellman" passing in the night, the "dwindling and late-risen moon" whose waning set the mood for his own "Phases of the Moon", oracular utterances on a declining civilization. Even in Yeats's own Tower the archetype of Babel affirms itself in the "ancient crumbling battlement". The Tower of the Tarot trumps, the Maison Dieu, is, above all, the Tower of Babel struck by the lightning of divine wrath, and signifies catastrophe and downfall. This emblem shows a tall tower, whose burning roof, which is also a crown, is struck off by a zigzag of lightning. Two figures are falling headlong and there are breaches in the walls. It is assigned to Mars, god of war, or, in Cabbalistic terms, to the divine anger whose de scending lightning is, with the meander of the Serpent and the direct upward Path of the Arrow, the third "way" on the Sephirotical Tree of God. The broken wall, the burning roof and tower And Agamemnon dead.</page><page sequence="36">KATHLEEN RAINE 147 The symbol of the Tower appears in Yeats's later work; the Tree of Life gives place to the edifice of wisdom, whose "winding ancient stair" becomes the "steep ascent" of gnosis; as the Biblical Garden of Eden gives place to the terminal image of the City "coming down from heaven", man's completed work. Arche typal symbols have a life of their own apart from and beyond any assigned meaning; and the Tower, whether taken to represent his own achievement, the nation "half dead at the top", or the empty ruin of "The Black Tower", retains its mystery. In this late poem the poet foresees a phase of history soon to come when "the savage god" reigns; the beacon-light of wisdom is out. The "men of the old black tower" of a no longer heeded wisdom must . . . feed as the goatherd feeds Their money spent, their wine gone sour .... ?but even then the high lonely tower must not be surrendered to the banners of an age that declares "God is dead": If he died long ago Why do you dread us so? A man's last duty is to die for his "right king": ... all are oath-bound men: Those banners come not in. In the rituals of the Golden Dawn mention is made of four watch towers that guard the north, south, east, and west. For Yeats there was no more potent symbol than the Tower he himself set up to withstand the siege of "the savage god" or the flood of modern ignorance: In mockery I have set A powerful symbol up And sing it rhyme upon rhyme In mockery of a time Half dead at the top.</page><page sequence="37">148 THE TAROT AND THE GOLDEN DAWN What has most astonished me in even this most superficial study of Yeats's use of the symbolism of magic acquired through the Hermetic Society of the Golden Dawn is the great background of undisclosed knowledge from which he wrote. He gave away no secrets of the Order; and yet he used continually a method won by long and hard work in a language studied today by few, but intrinsically valid, and which will therefore outlast the ig norance of the time. Even since Yeats pursued truths in his time and in our own so unfashionable, that revolt of the soul against intellect which he himself predicted has manifested itself in many ways, and at the time of writing wears the aspect, even, of revolution among the younger generation, prepared to take the archetypal world by storm. Truths so vital, so intrinsic to our very nature, cannot with impunity be denied. Jung wrote that "consciousness torn from its roots and no longer able to ap peal to the authority of the primordial images, possesses a Prome thean freedom, it is true, but it also partakes of the nature of a godless hybrisP</page></plain_text>
