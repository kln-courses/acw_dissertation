<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  8 Karen Tei Yamashita’s Los Angeles,   Tropic of Orange        8.1 THE GLOBAL CITY OF LOS ANGELES    The official slogan by the Los Angeles Times that “Los Angeles Brings It All  Together” (Soja 1989: 191) captures the paradigmatic and mythological impact  of the well-studied ‘postmetropolis’ (Soja 2000). Once founded on Mexican ter- ritory, Los Angeles turned into “one of the most ‘Anglo’ of all American me- tropolises” in the 1920s (Abu-Lughod 1999: 134) before it developed into a  world city with “extraordinary demographic and cultural heterogeneity” (Soja  2000: 227) and the highest American rate of foreign-born population (33 per- cent) (Anisef et al 2003: 3). At the turn of the millennium, the global city was,  and still is, due to its great ethnic diversity, both, the unofficial Mexican Ameri- can capital (Ortiz 1996: 247) and the Third World capital (Rieff 1991).  Los Angeles serves as a prototype (Beauregard 2003: 7) of the modern glob- al city (Sawhney 2002: 5). In terms of geography, infrastructure, and size, Los  Angeles is considered a “fragmented metropolis par excellence” (Fogelson 1967:  2). The “great big freeway” (Beveridge et al 2003: 49) is the global city’s nick- name and governing structure, stressing the importance of the automobile. Aris- ing from a desert, the city constantly boosted itself to become the entertainment  center of the world (Sudjic 1992: 80). However, the global city’s politics, econ- omy, and cultural diversity also supported the development of ethnic clusters and  gated communities, lead to it becoming the American homeless capital in the  1980s (Halle 2003: 12), and sparked one of the most violent American inter- ethnic ruptures: the 1992 Los Angeles riots.  Los Angeles began to grow in the mid-nineteenth century when Toronto and  New York have long been cities of regional or national importance. In 1835, Los  Angeles officially became a city with around 1,000 residents, then still belonging  to Mexico. With the Mexican-American War following the California gold rush,  </page> <page sequence="2"> 166 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    the city is controlled by Americans (Abu-Lughod 1999: 54f.). Once Los Angeles  was connected to the railway network, the city began its development, soon be- coming the most important American industrial city (Scott et al 1998: viii).  Thus, from 1,000 residents in the mid-nineteenth century, Los Angeles’s popula- tion exploded to more than 100,000 by the end of the nineteenth century (Abu- Lughod 1999: 139).  Similar to Toronto and New York, Los Angeles nowadays represents a “het- erogeneous mosaic” comprised of various ethnicities of different residence tradi- tion (Soja 2000: 283), quickly developing “from WASP hegemony toward the  poly-ethnic diversity” it is characterized by today (Davis 1990: 7).50 Dominated  by the Spanish language since its founding, Los Angeles became “overwhelm- ingly ‘white’ and native-born” by the beginning of the twentieth century (Abu- Lughod 1999: 134) when a majority of white middle-class Americans migrated  from the Eastern states between 1870 and 1900, shaping suburban Los Angeles  and its characteristic ‘polycentric sprawl’ (Soja 2000: 123). Besides the connec- tion with the railroad, the oil-boom, the growing importance of the harbor, and  marketing fostered the city’s progress (Abu-Lughod 1999: 134ff.), soon estab- lishing the motion picture, petroleum, and tourism industry (Soja 2000: 128).  Between 1900 and 1930, the population of Los Angeles and its counties grew  ten-fold to more than 2.5 million (Abu-Lughod 1999: 142f.). Masses of Eastern  and Southern Europeans migrated to the metropolis mainly in the 1920s (Davis  1990: 30). Moreover, following the stock-market crash in 1929, the so-called  ‘Dust Bowl migration’ led to migration from the Southern states, including poor  white and African Americans who settled in separate urban areas (Soja 2000:  131). Los Angeles was less affected by the Great Depression than New York  (Abu-Lughod 1999: 163), offering better economic and social prospects for mi- grants and immigrants. To accommodate the rising number of residents, a relia- ble water supply was established, thereby facilitating the city’s further growth  and continuous development. In 1913, the California Aqueduct provided suffi- cient water for the region, its population, and industries (Soja 2000: 128), and  the size of Los Angeles stretched ten-fold until 1930 through the annexation of  new communities (Abu-Lughod 1999: 154f.).  By the 1960s, due to “racist public administration, housing codes, zoning  practices, and police work,” Los Angeles had turned into one of the American  cities that was most segregated in ethnic, political, and geographic terms (Soja                                                                50  The informal term ‘WASP’ is the abbreviation of ‘White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.’ It  first appeared in the 1950s as a criticism of the elitist group of wealthy White Ameri- cans with an English Protestant background.  </page> <page sequence="3"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 167    2000: 139). Watts, for example, transformed from a mainly white to a largely  African American neighborhood in the 1940s, and, after the war, more ‘estab- lished’ Jewish or Mexican immigrants performed the jobs formerly done by Af- rican Americans (Abu-Lughod 1999: 248f.). This segregation caused serious  ethnic tensions, thereby sparking, among others, the 1965 Watts riots. During the  six-day riots, Jewish stores in Los Angeles were destroyed, about 1,000 build- ings damaged, 3,952 individuals arrested, 1,032 injured, and 34 killed (Halle et  al 2003a: 342).  The period following the Immigration Act of 1965 can be regarded as a ‘de- WASPing’ of Los Angeles and thus represents a reversal of the period between  1870 and 1900. In 1960, non-Hispanic whites still made up more than 80 percent  of the city’s population (Soja 2000: 136). After the Immigration Act, which  stopped the so-called ‘country-of-origin quotas’ (Foner 2000: 23f.), massive  immigrant waves changed Los Angeles (Soja 2000: 283). While before 1965 the  city received fewer non-European immigrants than New York (Waldinger 1996:  1079), after the Act, Los Angeles became the leading immigrant destination and  thus, it was home to about one fifth of all American immigrants by the end of the  twentieth century (Soja 2000: 283)  Following the 1965 Hart-Celler Immigration Act, the foreign-born popula- tion of Los Angeles tripled until 1990 to a proportion of 33 percent (Sabagh et al  2003: 102), of which more than 50 percent were Mexican, El Salvadorian, or  Guatemalan (Foner 2000: 10f.). Beginning in 1970, within only two decades, a  major shift from an Anglo majority of 70 percent to a non-Anglo majority of 60  percent took place in the County of Los Angeles, transforming the white enclave  in a Spanish-speaking region into “America’s leading Third World metropolis”  (Soja 2000: 141). Between 1980 and 1990 alone, two million immigrants arrived  in Los Angeles, of which 40 percent were Mexican (Abu-Lughod 1999: 302).  This was half a million more than the number of immigrants that arrived in New  York within the same period.  In 1990, the Los Angeles population was 39 percent Latino or Hispanic, 14  percent African American and ten percent Asian. While the percentage of Asians  remained the same, the proportion of Hispanic or Latino increased to 47 percent  and African Americans decreased to eleven percent in 2000 (Halle et al 2003b:  158). Thus, whereas African Americans were a historically more significant for- eign-born group in New York, Los Angeles had only about ten percent. This ten- year trend highlights the growing impact of the Spanish-speaking population in  the global city, reconnecting the city to its Mexican roots. In 1990, 40 percent of  Los Angelenos spoke a language other than English at home, which was ten per- </page> <page sequence="4"> 168 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    cent more than in New York and, in Los Angeles, Spanish was spoken twice as  often as in New York (Sabagh et al 2003: 103f.).   Los Angeles, a city with great Spanish influence from its founding and one  that ‘WASPed’ and ‘de-WASPed’ itself in the course of its history, has again in- creasingly become a Mexican-influenced city (Waldinger 1996: 1079). In 1990,  the ‘unofficial Mexican America capital’ (Ortiz 1996: 247) featured more than a  third of the declared Mexican American population (4.7 out of 13.4 million)  (Sabagh et al 2003: 105). In 2000, the proportion of Hispanics was more than 45  percent in Los Angeles, of which more than 80 percent was of Mexican origin  (Beveridge et al 2003: 61f.), turning the city into “the world’s largest Catholic  archdiocese” (Soja 2000: 141). Besides the geographical proximity and better  work opportunities, the effect of chain-migration furthers the growing number of  Hispanics when ethnic networks facilitate investment and immigration (Keil  1998: 143).    Due to its Pacific Coast location and the relative proximity to Mexico and  Asia in comparison to other North American cities, Latin Americans and Asians  constitute the two most influential immigrant groups in Los Angeles (Halle  2003: 14). Asians in Los Angeles are of diverse background, of which Japanese  constitute less than ten and Chinese 22 percent (Sabagh et al 2003: 107). Alt- hough immigrants to New York are the most ethnically diverse in America  (Foner 2000: 10), compared to Los Angeles, the New York’s Hispanic propor- tion of only 28 percent was much smaller and featured a different ethnic diversi- ty with a majority of Caribbean and Central and South American origin and  Mexicans representing the second to last group in size, with less than ten percent  (Beveridge et al 2003: 61f.).  The massive increase of immigrants until 1990, to about four million for- eign-born in Los Angeles within twenty years, was the most remarkable in the  world, making the West Coast city the immigrant region in America (Sabagh et  al 2003: 102f.). The new leading immigrant capital became a magnet of national  and international migration (Foner 2000: 10f.). As the so-called ‘Ellis Island of  the Pacific century’ (Sawhney 2002: 5), Los Angeles is now considered the most  important contemporary destination for immigration to the United States. Thus,  by the end of the twentieth century, the global city of Los Angeles is shaped by a  “poly-ethnic and poly-lingual society – with Anglos a declining minority” (Da- vis 1990: 87f.).  Los Angeles, with almost 18 million citizens in the Greater Los Angeles Ar- ea, is “indisputably a global city” (Sawhney 2002: 5) and featured in the top ten  of several global city hierarchies. Together with New York, Los Angeles is in  the top tier of global cities, while Toronto follows up in second tier (Brenner et  </page> <page sequence="5"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 169    al 2006: 3). Whereas New York is cited every time and Toronto eleven times in  a comprehensive study of “cities cited in world city research,” Los Angeles is  cited 13 out of 16 times (Taylor 2004: 40f.). Both, New York and Los Angeles  are considered to be ‘core primary cities’ in the world city hierarchy (Friedmann  1986), significant nodes in the global city network, and America’s ‘leading im- migrant destinations’ (Waldinger 1996: 1078). In terms of ‘global network con- nectivity,’ Los Angeles is ranked ninth and New York second in the top ten  world cities (Taylor 2004: 69).  Whereas New York, the classical haven for immigrants to America, fulfilled  the criteria of a global city as early as the 1870s (Abu-Lughod 1999: 40), Los  Angeles became a ‘prototopos’ (Soja 1989: 191) in the late twentieth century,  functioning as a “prism of different spatialities” (Davis 1990: 84). Los Angeles  is therefore referred to as the ‘proto-postmodern city’ (Dear et al 2002: 70, Löb- bermann 2008: 263), operating as a model urban region. The development of the  global city is intrinsically linked to globalization and its effects. The increase in  world-wide migration from Asia and Latin America, for example, changed the  city significantly and urbanization as such (Soja et al 1998: 3).   One of the distinguishing features of Los Angeles in comparison to New  York and Toronto is the urban sprawl of the so-called “monstro-City” (Soja  2006: 181). Although New York and Los Angeles are the two most populous cit- ies in America, the population of about four million Los Angeles residents in  2000 is roughly only half of New York’s (Halle 2003: 1). The “hundred mile  city” Los Angeles (Abu-Lughod 1999: 358; Sudjic 1992: 80), however, is ex- tremely spread out geographically, with businesses and activities extending over  a vast, decentralized hinterland (Halle 2003: 1). This structure of ‘the postme- tropolis’ (Soja 2000) is, for the L.A. School of Urbanism exemplary for how cit- ies developed in the twentieth century and are developing in the twenty-first cen- tury.  Although Los Angeles is not one of three examples used to coin the term  ‘global city’ by Saskia Sassen (1991: 4), it is nevertheless considered the ‘proto- type’ (Beauregard 2003: 7) of a modern global city. The Los Angeles School of  Urbanism51 emerged as a result of this uniqueness because the global city “seems  to break every rule of urban readability and regularity” (Soja 2006: 181), being  unlike previous prototypes such as Chicago and other leading world cities. In- spired by the ‘Frankfurt School’ (Davis 1990: 84) and developed in the mid- 1980s at the University of Southern California in Los Angles (UCLA) and be-                                                               51  For more information on urban studies and the different schools of urbanism, see  Chapter 3 on ‘Global Cities as Cultural Nodal Points.’  </page> <page sequence="6"> 170 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    yond, the L.A. School functions as a counter-initiative to the dominant Chicago  School of Urban Studies. Main scholars of the L.A. School include Edward W.  Soja, Mike Davis, Allen J. Scott, Michael Dear, and Steven Flusty. Although  Los Angeles is often criticized as “a city without a past” (Dear 1998: 76), the  ‘L.A. School’ views it “as the paradigm of the future” (Davis 1990: 86).   Los Angeles is exemplary for city building, forming a whole of spread-out  towns and villages (Soja et al 1998: 1). Similar to Toronto, which had amalga- mated into Canada’s largest city by 1998 (Hutton 2010: 119) after fusing several  municipalities (Allahwala et al 2010: 210), Los Angeles grew steadily in popula- tion and size. By the start of this millennium, the five-county region of Los An- geles encompassed over 170 municipalities (Soja 2000: 141). With 12,561  square kilometers in 2000, Los Angeles was the second most wide-spread city in  the world, although it is only ranked twelfth in terms of population size (Bronger  2004: 174). Therefore, the metropolization rate is lower than New York’s and  very low in comparison to cities such as Soul, Buenos Aires, or Tokyo (Bronger  2004: 174).  From the city’s beginning, Los Angeles was characterized by fragmentation  and odd infrastructure without a core city (Abu-Lughod 1999: 134). Since Alli- son Lurie’s mid-1960s novel, Los Angeles has been known as “The Nowhere  City” (Lurie 1965; Clarke 1988: 126). The “entangled and labyrinthine space” of  the 465 square mile city has no single origin and no center (Lehan 1998: 257).  Thus, in contrast to the former development of cities around a core, the city is  spacious and leveled, reminding one of a doughnut structure. The formerly im- portant downtown has decreased in significance, with many Los Angelenos nev- er having been there (Soja 2006: 180).  Mobility is a key concept of American culture and much more than a neces- sity for the “great big freeway” (Beveridge et al 2003: 49), Los Angeles. Due to  its fragmentation and decentralization, freeways are the global city’s governing  structure. Mass transportation within the spread-out city was doomed early to  failure. Although many attempts were made in the early twentieth century, pub- lic transportation by horse-car, cable car, or street trolley was not successful  (Abu-Lughod 1999: 143). Due to trains degenerating after the Great Depression,  80 percent of passenger miles in Los Angeles were conducted by car (Fogelson  1967: 274). By the end of the 1930s and as part of the city’s industrialization  process, the renowned Los Angeles freeway system had been planned, further  encouraging the stretched-out infrastructure of today (Abu-Lughod 1999: 253).  The type of living and interaction of the global city’s minorities is closely  connected to the infrastructural history of Los Angeles. Private transportation  mobility in Los Angeles is of more significance than in New York or Toronto  </page> <page sequence="7"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 171    (Perl et al 2010: 194). In contrast to the ‘walking city’ New York (Beveridge et  al 2003: 49) and the major public transportation system in Toronto, Los Angeles  is dominated by its freeway system. Ethnic clusters, poor Mexican neighborhood  enclaves, so-called ‘barrios,’ the many diverse unskilled workers (Soja 2000:  227), the rising number of homeless (Halle 2003: 12) as well as the mostly An- glo so-called ‘gated communities’ of the privileged, which enforce social bound- aries in ‘the fortress city’ (Davis 1990), are symptomatic of the city’s structure  and sociality. The freeway construction thus led to tremendous infrastructural  displacement in the form of ethnic geographical clusters, enforcing “social divi- sions in ways that were mostly symbolic before” (Monahan 2002: 164).   The population of Los Angeles moving to the city until the 1930s, however,  was united by its perception of a new dispersed and heterogeneous suburbanism,  sustainably changing the urban landscape into a “fragmented metropolis” (Fo- gelson 1967: 273). Chinese clusters in Los Angeles, for example, coined the  term ‘ethnoburbs’ (Liu 1998; Hall 2010: 60), relating to specific established im- migrants clusters in dispersed patterns. Moreover, in Los Angeles and its greater  region, a so-called ‘Tortilla-Mercedes Divide’52 has long existed, describing “the  social and economic separation between the more affluent White and poorer  Mexican populations” (Allen 2002: 701). This gap and many others enforce the  city’s development. By the end of the 1980s, Los Angeles had become increas- ingly polarized by ethnicity and class (Abu-Lughod 1999: 367) in demographic  as well as geographic terms. Thus, “the epicenter of globalization” (Sawhney  2002: 5) both captures and highlights the coexistence of the ‘First world’ and the  ‘Third world’ within one city. Los Angeles therefore visualizes the effect of  globe-encompassing migration across borders better than most other global cit- ies.  By the mid-1990s, the former ‘black-white boundary’ slowly began to vanish  in Los Angeles due to massive Latino migration (Soja 2000: 142). Racial bound- aries, however, were not erased, as the 1992 L.A. Riots violently illustrated. The  six-day movement mainly took place in Los Angeles and was sparked by the un- satisfactory jury’s verdict on the police officers who beat up the African Ameri- can Rodney King. The riots resulted in interethnic uproar, assault, arson, and  murder. More than 50 people were killed. A regional economic depression fol- lowed when the population started to mistrust the local police force (Kaufmann  2003: 323). This violent explosion is explained as grounded in the very compli-                                                               52  The term ‘Tortilla-Mercedes Divide’ refers to T.C. Boyle’s recent novel The Tortilla  Curtain (1995), which illustrates the differences between poor (illegal) Mexican im- migrants and wealthy Whites in Los Angeles  </page> <page sequence="8"> 172 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    cations of space and sociality arising from “the exceedingly volatile cityspace  produced by new urbanization processes, with its unprecedented cultural hetero- geneity, widening social and economic disparities, and multiplying points of ten- sion and confrontation” (Soja 2000: 299).  The city’s economic and infrastructural development, however, was intrinsi- cally linked to the commercialization of the unique city culture and the success- ful myth-making processes. The global city’s culturally diverse labor force in- spired the region’s entrepreneurship and cultural urban life (Soja 2000: 184).  Moreover, tourism is a major asset of the global city, supporting its economy.  More than five million foreign tourists visited Los Angeles in 2000 (Gladstone et  al 2003: 81), which is a bigger share of national visitors and about a million less  international visitors than New York.  The city’s image and self-conception have changed immensely over time.  The global city emerged from the desert and being driven by American capital- ism, has grown to one of the most significant urban complexes in the world. Im- portant stakeholders in this process included ‘the Boosters,’ ‘the Noirs,’ and ‘the  Exiles’ (Davis 1990: 22ff.), each searching for the “land of opportunities for all”  (Sawhney 2002: 5; italics original). At the beginning of Southern California’s  ‘Booster Era’ between 1885 and 1925, Los Angeles was considered “the most  violent town in the West” (Davis 1990: 26). The numerous ensuing, sometimes  contradicting legends that arose (Taylor 1983: 33), attracted working-class and  middle-class migrants alike. By the 1960s, thanks to the ‘Noir’ scene and a great  number of exile writers from Europe, Los Angeles and the Hollywood ‘dream  factory’ had become specialists in the production of images and myths (Soja  2000: 136).  Hollywood and its huge entertainment industry is the symbol for globaliza- tion as Americanization. Los Angeles, known as the world’s ‘entertainment cen- ter’ (Sudjic 1992: 80) and the culture industry’s world capital (Davis 1990: 17),  is one of the most mediated American cities (Sorkin 1982: 8; Davis 1990: 20). It  is a place where American culture is made, thereby functioning as a marketing  machinery of American values. The myth-making in Los Angeles and the prolif- eration of the ideal of the American dream is commercialized, instrumentalized  as a commodity, and then promoted to Americans “like automobiles, cigarettes  and mouth wash” (Mayo 1933: 319; Davis 1990: 17).  Global viewers of television and cinema have the images of Hollywood in  mind (Clarke 1988: 125), which is the alter-ego of Los Angeles (Davis 1990:  18), and successfully links “the dreamer to the dream” (Lehan 1998: 257). The  Hollywood Sign is the advertisement as such, promising and signifying the  American dream. In addition to Hollywood, the urban image of Los Angeles is  </page> <page sequence="9"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 173    also significantly influenced by Disneyland (Clarke 1988: 125). The global city  invented ‘urban Imagineering’ (Soja 2000: 136), absorbing the identity of other  cities and consciousness in general (Lehan 1998: 257). Some critics even claim  that it is not globalization that affects Hollywood but that the film industry has  an effect on globalization (Shiel 2001: 11).  Well before Los Angeles and Hollywood became the ‘American dream fac- tory,’ New York was the ‘land of promise’ (Bell et al 2011: 261). New York,  however, still provides the financial network for the proliferation of American  culture from Hollywood (Abu-Lughod 1999: 290). Due to geo-proximity and  lower costs, however, Toronto’s film industry’s growth rate is greater than that  of Los Angeles (Vinodrai 2010: 105). Los Angeles nonetheless remains the  world’s ‘entertainment center’ (Sudjic 1992) with its capital, however, still most- ly controlled in the financial center New York.  Los Angeles is one of the rare cities in which words are not the central form  of expression and representation. Instead, due to its brief history mainly influ- enced by the film industry, movies are the city’s prevailing form of articulation  (Ulin 2002: xiv). In the twentieth century, the city’s mythologizers were interna- tional filmmakers, American novelists working for the film industry, and Euro- pean academic exiles who “radically reworked the metaphorical figure of the  city” (Davis 1990: 20). Thus, Los Angeles literature did take long to flourish.  The writers moving west, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner, or  writers looking for political asylum in the twentieth century, such as Bertolt  Brecht and Thomas Mann (Ulin 2002: xiv), turned Los Angeles into “the world  capital of an immense Culture Industry” (Davis 1990: 17). The growing film in- dustry encouraged national and international work-seeking writers to move to  Los Angeles, thereby slowly supporting the development of a literary scene  (Ulin 2002: xv).  As Los Angeles is a city of opposites, its literature is also characterized by  ‘cacophony’ (Ulin 2002: xvi). Nevertheless, three recurring themes can be iden- tified with regard to Los Angeles literature: 1) themes of fantasy, dream, and  progress, 2) the automobile, and 3) film noir, which constitutes the city’s most  renowned genre, featuring topics of urban chaos, misery, violence, and apoca- lypse.  The theme of the American dream and fantasy was linked early to Los Ange- les as the most Western frontier of the continental United States. This domina- tion of space, nature, and technology translates into the theme of progress. F.  Scott Fitzgerald’s The Last Tycoon (1941), for example, is a novel associated  with “the frontier movement, Manifest Destiny, California Dreaming” (Lehan  1998: 257).  </page> <page sequence="10"> 174 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    The theme of the automobile is closely connected to the theme of progress,  individuality, and independence. There is a long tradition of fiction describing  Los Angeles as a city ruled by the automobile, such as Thomas Pynchon’s post- modern fiction The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), Ed Ruscha’s Twentysix Gasoline  Stations (1962) and Thirtyfour Parking Lots (1967), Joan Didion’s Play It as It  Lays (1971), and Hugo Williams’ No Particular Place to Go (1981). Driving a  car, road signs, and moving through the city on the freeway becomes the major  perspective on the city53 because automobiles “constitute the essential icons of  Los Angeles” (Ulin 2002: xv).  In literary and cinematic terms, the third theme ‘noir’ is the most associated  with Los Angeles, turning the city into a place that “American intellectuals love  to hate” (Davis 1990: 21). Hollywood is strongly influenced by the city’s noir  culture, acting as a counterculture to the glamour and happy Hollywood ending  (Ulin 2002: xvii) and as an antithesis to themes of progress and moving West. In  the 1940s, Los Angeles turns into the Film Noir city, portraying the downside of  the ‘American dream factory,’ such as violence, murder, death, intrigues, and the  unconscious, reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe’s works (Clarke 1988: 142). The  city is portrayed as a ‘junkyard of dreams,’ representing a simultaneous utopia  and dystopia (Davis 1990: 18).  As part of the noir movement, Raymond Chandler’s The Big Sleep (1978  [1939]) and Nathaniel West’s The Day of the Locust (1983 [1939]) form a new  and existential literature of Los Angeles (Ulin 2002: xv). West’s The Day of the  Locust (1983 [1939]), which is considered the “best-known Hollywood novel”  (Rhodes 2008: 10), pictures the city as urban hell with “a brutal violence waiting  to erupt” (Lehan 1998: 259). Chandler’s novel is set in the period of the Great  Depression, portraying Los Angeles as “a strange neon world of light and col- our” (Clarke 1988: 141) that is full of corruption.  Thus, similar to Los Angeles, a city with ‘no unifying center,’ its literature is  in the same way decentered with no single logic. Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic  of Orange manages to capture this multi-layered identity of the city, its form, lit- erature, and inhabitants by transcribing it into the novel’s structure, narrative,  geography, and the characters’ cultural diversity and the polyphonic sound.  Yamashita’s novel is inspired by the city’s literary past and post-riot images and  challenges. The novel is motivated by the most influential genre ‘noir,’ featuring  an apocalypse-like disaster-movie setting that is ironically caused by an orange,                                                                53  For more information about the history of movement, traffic, and the automobile in  Los Angeles and its literature, see Graham Clarke’s ‘The Great Wrong Place’: Los  Angeles as Urban Milieu (1988).  </page> <page sequence="11"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 175    the symbol of California dreaming, American progress, and western capitalism  across borders. A reporter reminiscent of a noir detective investigates the illegal  drug traffic and organ trade. And, finally, with the imagined Los Angeles free- ways functioning as a metaphor of the city’s veins, all three identified themes of  Los Angeles literature are incorporated in the global city novel, thereby imaging  Los Angeles as ‘The World City.’      8.2 LOS ANGELES IMAGINED: THE WORLD CITY    Whereas Brand’s literary Toronto is expressed as a city with many different,  overlapping worlds and Lee’s New York as a city, in which language is the gov- erning structure, Yamashita’s Los Angeles captures both and the complexity, di- versity, and multiplicity of the globe, virtually representing ‘the World City.’  Similar to the global city, the imagined Los Angeles in Yamashita’s Tropic of  Orange (1997) is a fragmented urban world in terms of ethnicity, class, and the  freeway (Rody 2009: 130). The different worlds are illustrated by a variety of  characters with individually tailored narrative voices, interacting as an inter- ethnic network and collaborating in the end when borders are moving and merg- ing in a ‘time-space compression’ (Harvey 1989). Therefore, the imagined glob- al city of Los Angeles can be regarded as ‘the World City,’ in which different  worlds, such as the ‘First World’ and the ‘Third World,’ come together, collide,  or cooperate.  Karen Tei Yamashita was born in Oakland, California in 1951. She spent  most of her childhood in Los Angeles and returned to the ‘city of angels’ after a  year in Japan and nine years in Brazil to once again become a native in 1984.  Yamashita is a so-called sansei Japanese American, a third generation immi- grant.54 She is married to a Brazilian, whose family is shaped by Portuguese,  Spanish, and Italian influence. She considered herself an immigrant when return- ing from Brazil to California. She is the Professor for Literature and Creative  Writing at the University of California in Santa Cruz.  Yamashita’s previous works Through the Arc of the Rain Forest (1990) and  Brazil-Maru (1992) are mainly set in Brazil and incorporate local-global dialects  of the interdependence of the economy and ecology. Circle K Cycles (2001) is a  patchwork of fiction and non-fiction on a second-generation Brazilian Japanese                                                                54  A sansei Japanese American is born from Nisei or second generation Japanese Ameri- cans, who are the children of first generation Japanese American, also called issei,  born in Japan  </page> <page sequence="12"> 176 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    family’s struggle to assimilate. Her most recent novel I Hotel (2010) was a final- ist in the National Book Award in fiction. It manages to capture in a kaleido- scope-like fashion diverse Asian American experiences in a San Francisco hotel  in 1968 and the following nine years.  Yamashita is considered ‘a global novelist’ (Ling 2012: xvi), encompassing  and incorporating different ‘national’ styles, spaces, histories, and characters,  creating a global interethnic literature. Transnational travel and research of the  Japanese community in Brazil and her bonding with different L.A. communities  are mirrored in her writing. L.A. could also function as the abbreviation of Latin  America due to the city’s huge Latin American community. This influence reap- pears in Yamashita’s writing, including, for example, Mexican American myths  and characters. Moreover, she is inspired by international writers and critics,  such as Italo Calvino, Toni Morrison, or John Irving (Glixman 2007). With the  inclusion of a wide variety of different cultural influences and the rewriting of  various literary conventions, Yamashita has played a major role in the redefini- tion of Asian American literary studies.  Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange (1997) takes place in two coun- tries, includes at least three languages and characters of several different ethnici- ties. Yamashita goes beyond Japanese American literature, focusing on her char- acters’ cultural diversity and mobility in a globalizing world. She manages to  portray characters that transgress borders as well as the concept of ‘uni-ethnical’  identities. In the light of the 1990s ‘paradigm shift’ from a national to a transna- tional focus in Asian American literature, Yamashita further broadened the view  to a “transnational space of the Americas” (Rody 2009: 128).   Yamashita’s style of writing surprised both publishers and readership as she  did not comply with previous Asian American genre conventions. Similar to  Chang-rae Lee’s experience, one of the two other authors focused in this work,  ethnic labeling was an issue for Yamashita. The Japanese American author faced  difficulty finding a publisher because the novel’s poetics of narrative, space, and  code-switching are not associated with Asian American literary traditions. Simi- lar to Dionne Brand and Chang-rae Lee, Karen Tei Yamashita can be considered  to an extent as a regional writer who is very accustomed to the urban space  themed in the novel. In Tropic of Orange, the poetics of place focus on the city  of L.A. as well as on the U.S.-Mexican border region. Yamashita blends histori- cal persons and places with detailed fiction and elements of magical realism to  illustrate the impact of globalization and its effects. Yamashita presents many  provocative and ironic statements in her book and enthralls the reader with a  well-structured story and the interplay of the various characters, emphasized by  the hybrid layout of the novel.  </page> <page sequence="13"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 177    The novel is significantly set in the global city of Los Angeles shortly fol- lowing the 1992 riots and a time of severe incidents of border conflicts and ille- gal immigration. The novel displays the local and global challenges of cultural  diversity, migration, and socio-political integration, featuring regional, national,  and international topics of globalization. Moreover, the changing image of the  global city is illustrated, incorporating themes of Hollywood, the rising numbers  of homeless as well as Spanish-speaking characters and themes in a city that is  restructuring from a former black-and-white divide and has become, once again,  a home for many Mexicans.  The poetics of narrative, place, and code-switching equally contribute to the  ethnic global city novel, displaying the multiperspectival and network-like struc- ture, character relationships, and the interdependency of the ‘First world’ and  ‘Third world,` converging in the simultaneous urban and border contact zone of  the global(izing) city. As a result of the collaboration of the different characters,  the seven individual worlds are revealed as one in the end, converging in ‘The  World City.’ Yamashita thus creates a ‘third space’ in and beyond the urban  complexity of the cultural nodal point of Los Angeles, one in which interethnic  identities are constantly negotiated beyond cultural lines.  The novel is analyzed in five sections, addressing issues of narrative struc- ture, genre and globalization, polyglotism and interethnic collaboration, globali- zation and the global, the elasticity of time and space as well as the significance  of the title and of borders as connecting or dividing lines. The next section ex- plores how the different themes, ethnicities, and cultural elements of the global  city of Los Angeles are interwoven into the novel. This translation of the global  city’s urban space, including its history and closely intertwined ethnic diversity  is illustrated in the novel’s introductory overview, called ‘HyperContexts.’    8.2.1 HyperContexts    As Karen Tei Yamashita’s ‘HyperContexts’ indicates (see Illustration 1), the  novel is constructed in a very sophisticated manner. This introductory structure  to the book is used as a means of chapter and character overview that manages to  capture the multi-layered textuality of the global city, its form, literature, and in- habitants. The author used a Lotus spreadsheet to structure the novel, its time  and spatiality, characters as well as the plot and resolution (Glixman 2007). It  shows the novel’s frame, chapter layout, and different narrative threads at a  glance, while simultaneously incorporating different themes of the city of Los  Angeles and its history, such as film noir, mass media production, the freeway,  and border traffic.   </page> <page sequence="14"> 178 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    Illustration 1: HyperContexts       Monday Tuesday Wednesday  Summer Solstice Diamond Lane Cultural Diversity          Midday -Not Too Far Morning Daylight  Rafaela from Mazatlán - En México -The Cornfield  Cortes chapter 1 chapter 10 chapter 18         Bobby Benefits Car Payment Due Second Mortgage  Ngu -Koreatown -Tijuana via Singa- -Chinatown  chapter 2 pore chapter 15   chapter 12       Emi Weather Report NewsNow Disaster Movie  -Westside -Hollywood South Week  chapter 3 chapter 9 -Hiro’s Sushi   chapter 20       Buzzworm Station ID Oldies LA X  -Jefferson &amp; Nor- -This Old Hood -Margarita’s Corner  mandie chapter 13 chapter 16  chapter 4       Manzanar Mu- Traffic Window Rideshare The Hour of the  rakami -Harbor Freeway -Downtown Inter- Trucks -The Free- chapter 5 change way Canyon   chapter 8 chapter 19       Gabriel Coffee Break Budgets The Interview  Balboa -Downtown -Skirting Downtown -Manzanar  chapter  6 chapter 14 chapter  17         Arcangel To Wake To Wash To Eat  -Marketplace -On the Tropic -La Cantina de Mise- chapter 7 chapter 11 ria y Hambre  chapter 21     </page> <page sequence="15"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 179           Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday  The Eternal Buzz Artificial Intelli- Queen of Angels Pacific Rim  gence       Dusk Dawn Nightfall Midnight  -To the Border -The Other Side -Aztlán -The Line  chapter 24 chapter 30 chapter 38 chapter 45         Life Insurance Visa Card Social Security American Express  -L.A./T.J. -Final Destination -I-5 -Mi Casa/Su Casa  chapter 26 chapter 34 chapter 40 chapter 49         Live on Air Promos Prime Time Commercial Break  -El A -World Wide Web -Last Stop -The Big Sleep  chapter 27 chapter 29 chapter 41 chapter 44         You Give Us 22 AM/FM The Car Show Hour 25  Minutes    -The -FreeZone -Front Line -Into the Boxes  World chapter 31 chapter 37 chapter  48  chapter 22       Lane Change Jam Drive-By SigAlert  -Avoiding the Har- -Greater L.A. -Virtually Every- -The Rim  bor chapter 35 where chapter 46  chapter 28 chapter 42       Time &amp; a Half Overtime Working Weekend Deadline  -Limousine Way -El Zócalo -Dirt Shoulder -Over the Net  chapter  25 chapter 32 chapter  39 chapter  43         To Labor To Dream To Perform To Die  -East and West For- -America -Angel’s Flight -Pacific Rim Audi- ever chapter 33 chapter  36 torium  chapter  23 chapter 47  Yamashita 1997     </page> <page sequence="16"> 180 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    The ‘HyperContexts’ is one of the novel’s methods of incorporating the textuali- ty of the interconnectedness of time, space, and literary conventions. The chapter  subheads thereby function as a telling element of the plot, giving away infor- mation about the characters and their situation in advance. Chapter 44 ‘Commer- cial Break - The Big Sleep,’ for example, alludes to Raymond Chandler’s fa- mous 1930s noir work and to Emi’s death.55 Similarly, Roman Polanski’s China- town (1974) is included as a chapter subhead (Chapter 15) in the overview to  show awareness of the movie’s implications because this film noir genre classic  is the one “against which Asian American writers of crime fiction must write”  (Huang 2010: 8). This unique technique of referencing in the ‘HyperContexts’  produces an ‘encyclopedic novel’ that is no longer identified as simply “narra- tive” (Heise 2006: 212f.).  The HyperContexts functions as the novel’s skeleton or frame. It is divided  into seven parts, both horizontally and vertically, representing either one day of  the week or one character. The days are themed from “Summer Solstice” on  Monday to “Pacific Rim” on Sunday. The fact that the story is told in one week  gives rise to assumptions of biblical associations of how the whole world was  created in the course of one week. In the novel, the world is threatened by the  apocalypse of a global orange scare, which is resolved within the week. This  apocalyptic setting is a satire of the popular Hollywood disaster movie.  In addition to the themed days of the week, the 49 individual subchapter  headlines always refer to a location, highlighting the significance of time and  space as a vital part of the narrative. The seven main characters’ actions take  place between Los Angeles and Mazatlán, Mexico. The novel’s structure repre- sents the city’s infrastructure because, similarly, there is no original and no cen- ter (Lehan 1998: 257) but a wide variety of locations and a complex network of  seven characters. Thus, like the geography of the global city of Los Angeles, the  narrative in not centralized but seems to be shaped by fragmentation. This ap- proach resembles a postmodern representation of urban structure, global narra- tive, and ethnic diversity (Raussert 2011: 103).  Although the seven stories that suggest separation and isolation make the  narrative appear divided and thus “fragmented” (Lee 2011: 319), in the end, a  synergy of narrative is created by the converging of the individual stories. The  narrative is evenly focused on the protagonists, who each have one chapter a day  to tell their story or world view, thus creating equality in terms of the poetics of  narrative and political representation. Thus, vertically, the balanced approach of                                                                55   For more information on the significance of Emi’s death, please see Section 8.2.5 on  ‘These Lines.’  </page> <page sequence="17"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 181    the novel is illustrated in ‘HyperContexts’ because there is no singular main pro- tagonist from the start but seven characters that evenly contribute to the story  line. In the end, as in a mosaic, all pieces of the different and increasingly over- lapping worlds come together to form a whole picture. As a result of the charac- ters’ interethnic collaboration, seven worlds are established, converging into one  in the end. Therefore, the selected characters can serve as a snapshot of the mul- tiplicity of the citizens of Los Angeles, illustrating the diversity of the inhabit- ants of the global city, the border region, and the world. Thus, a global view  composed of seven different but interacting perspectives is created, representing  ‘The World City” and simultaneously promoting the notion of ‘cultural diversi- ty.’  The different individually designed chapter headlines match a description of  the respective character. Hence, when reading Emi’s headlines (also featured in  Illustration 1; read from left to right): ‘Weather Report,’ ‘News Now,’ ‘Disaster  Movie Week,’ ‘Live on Air,’ ‘Promos,’ ‘Prime Time,’ and ‘Commercial Break,’  the audience gains a first impression of her character, interests, beliefs, and  flaws. It is revealed from the start that Emi is interested in technology and works  in the media industry of L.A. The analysis by chapter headlines works analo- gously for the remaining six characters. Rafaela Cortes is a Chicana from Mexi- co, married to Bobby Ngu, and taking care of Gabriel Balboa’s house in Mazat- lán. Her chapters from ‘Midday’ on Monday to ‘Midnight’ on Sunday represent  a time-space-compression, reversing the course of a day within a week while  travelling from Mexico to Los Angeles. Her husband Bobby is introduced as a  hard-working Chinese immigrant, focused on money and social security. Where- as African American Vietnam Veteran Buzzworm is all about music and the ra- dio, Japanese American Manzanar Murakami is crazy about the freeway traffic.  Arcangel, the old traveler from Mexico, is primitively described by what he  does, such as ‘To Wake,’ ‘To Eat,’ or ‘To Die.’  Whereas each of the seven characters is narrated with an individual idiolect56  to emphasize diversity, Arcangel’s chapters feature historical facts intertwined  with ironic remarks. Called the “messenger” (TRO 199), Arcangel is inspired by  a short story character of the Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez (Heise  2006: 212). While the novel’s characters function as a representative of their  class or ethnic group, Arcangel significantly represents Latin America as a  whole, including its future and its past (Benito et al 2009: 84). As “the voice of  the colonized Latin America” (Sadowski-Smith 2008: 66), he speaks up con-                                                               56  For more information on the seven individually tailored narrative voices, see Section  8.2.2 on ‘The Polyglot.’  </page> <page sequence="18"> 182 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    jointly for “the indigenous, the displaced, the exterminated, the poor, and the  workers” (Lee 2011: 322). Thus, particular narratological strategies can mirror  different forms of diversity and vice versa.  Similar to Mexican performance artist Guillermo Gómez-Peña, who is cited  in the novel’s prologue,57 globalization is criticized as Westernization and thus  Americanization by Arcangel, who recounts the story of colonization. According  to him, the doom of the earth is approaching in 2012, which he relates to Colum- bus’ discovery of America. With this discovery, globalization as a phenomenon  began (Reichardt 2010: 31), being the first stimulus of world-wide commerce  and migration (Ette 2004: 29). With the incorporation of poetry written in italics,  the novel recounts “indigenous Aztec mythologies” (Sadowski-Smith 2008: 66).  As Arcangel ironically retells, the reason for Columbus’ conquest of America  happened solely    because of a lousy bunch of spices  to hide the putrefaction of meat! (TRO: 49; original in italics)    The story of Christopher Columbus’ conquest of America is combined with ele- ments of magic realism to illustrate the diverse influence on writing and to paro- dy literary conventions. With a trans-categorical blending of fiction and fact, his- torical bits of information (e.g. TRO: 49-51) are interwoven with autobiograph- ical elements as well as mystical and supernatural elements, thereby creating a  Hollywood-like disaster blockbuster with an independent movie’s appeal. Magic  realism, a typical Chicano style not common among Japanese Americans, is also  used in the beginning of the book when Rafaela sweeps different animals from  the floor, such as crabs and snakes (TRO: 3), although the house is not situated at  the edge of the sea. The novel thus manages to enthrall the reader with  knowledge about the Mexican past and literary conventions.  Whereas six of the seven characters are narrated in a limited or omniscient  third-person style (Rody 2009: 132), the Chicano newspaper reporter Gabriel  Balboa is presented in a detective-like first-person narration (Benito et al 2009:  81). Emi compares Gabriel to Raymond Chandler’s 1930s noir detective Philip  Marlowe (TRO 22) when he is investigating the downside of Hollywood (TRO:  39). The ending of the story disrupts the cliché of the legendary L.A. detective                                                                57  For more information on the novel’s inspiration by the work of Guillermo Gómez- Peña and his concept of a ‘borderless future,’ please see Section 8.2.5 on ‘These  Lines.’  </page> <page sequence="19"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 183    story approach58 because the collaboration of the seven characters is the key to  success. Moreover, even though most of the story takes place in Hollywood, the  novel ironically does not feature a typical happy Hollywood ending when Emi  dies. Nevertheless, the story is staged in a very entertaining apocalypse Holly- wood blockbuster style.  Global literature often presents the effects of globalization, such as increased  connectivity or the acceleration of global flows. In the novel, the theme of glob- alization is also translated into the rewriting of binaries and the mixing of genres,  such as the immigrant novel, disaster movie, noir, telenovela, magical realism,  satire, and detective fiction. Therefore, multiplicity plays an important role in the  novel on different levels. Similar to the network-like composition of the seven  diverse characters and their stories, different and coexisting forms of genre are  mixed. Moreover, myths and metaphors from different cultural spheres are com- bined. Thus, Latin American magical realism is used, for example, translating  between the United States and Mexico as well as the Asian American heritage.  This mixing of genres supersedes the former standards of ethnic American fic- tion, and Asian American fiction in particular, paving the road for new narrative  leeway in a globalizing age (Rody 2009: 136).  With the combination of different elements of genre, a “transtextual space”  (Sturm-Trigonakis 2007: 156) is created. This aligns with the tendency of  transtextual elements accumulate in hybrid texts in ethnic writing (Birkle 2004:  231) and new world literature (Sturm-Trigonakis 2007: 143) in a globalizing  age. Moreover, binaries are omnipresent in the story. Oppositional elements –  old versus new, good versus bad, fiction versus fact, developed versus develop- ing country, or cosmopolitan versus rural areas – are addressed and challenged.  In the course of the story, it all comes down to a “showdown between [...] North  and South, bad oranges and good, virtual and magical” (Rauch 1998: 29), result- ing in a clash of dichotomies. In terms of globalization, negative as well as posi- tive effects are displayed, yet, the direction is clear because the convergence  emerges from the South as a promotion of globalization as hybridization and not  merely as an Americanization force.  Another important element of ethnic, urban, and global literature is code- switching. Multilingualism and code-switching are of major importance in bor- der regions (Anzaldúa 1987) and urban areas (Eastman 1992: 16). Due to its ge- opolitical position and historical development, the global city of Los Angeles                                                                58  The ‘L.A. detective story’ is a crime drama or film noir usually staged in Hollywood,  such as Detective Story (1951) featuring Kirk Douglas.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 184 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    features both. In the next section on ‘The Polyglot’, the impact and importance  of code-switching in the novel is examined.    8.2.2 The Polyglot    In Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange, the poetics of code-switching functions as a  tool to convey the diversity of Los Angeles and its inhabitants on numerous lev- els and from multiple perspectives. The egalitarian structure of the novel as illus- trated by the HyperContexts,59 the multi-ethnic cast, and the individually tailored  narrative voice of each of the characters transcend former Asian American genre  classifications, pointing towards a representation of the global. The story is told  in a ‘polyglot’ fashion (Murashige 2006), aiming at a realistic articulation of the  characters’ culturally diverse identities. By giving every character an individual  narrative voice, seven perspectives are featured to envision seven different  worlds coexisting and later collaborating in Los Angeles. Thus, a ‘narrative po- lyphony’ (Raussert 2011: 100) is created, echoing the chorus of ethnic diversity  and multiplicity in the global city of Los Angeles.  In the novel, specific language is used as an indicator for ethnic diversity  when, as Yamashita states in an interview, the “rhythmic sound sensibility” is  translated into the seven protagonists’ different narrative voices (Glixman 2007).  While speaking through the main characters, the style of writing is altered from,  for example, simple and basic (Bobby Ngu), to street-talk (Buzzworm), to poetic  (Arcangel), and to a kind of detective style (Gabriel Balboa). This “chorus of  voices” (Adams 2007: 264) emphasizes the ‘pan-cultural’ approach in the novel  (Gier et al 1998). Moreover, English, Japanese, and Spanish are incorporated to  highlight the diversity of the novel’s characters because global processes of hy- bridization are translated into literature with the use of multiple languages (Ette  2007: 14).  Yamashita, a multilingual speaker of English, Portuguese, and some Japa- nese, mimics the production of a language when tailoring the narrative voices.  Thereby, individual linguistic markers are absorbed, such as ethnically distinct  speech patterns and syntax (Glixman 2007). This type of narration achieves the  same effect as when an actor plays seven different roles for a blind audience.  The description and conveyance of diverse looks and multicultural appearance  alone is not sufficient. Instead, syntax and speech pattern are copied and per- formed according to pre-assigned roles. Thus, in contrast to Lee’s Native Speak-                                                               59  For more information on the significance of the HyperContexts, please see Section  8.2.1.  </page> <page sequence="21"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 185    er, this effect is accomplished predominantly with the literary technique of  ‘showing’ instead of ‘telling.’  Although the story is mostly told in a third-person narration, the narrative  voice is altered every chapter in a mimetic fashion to suit the respective charac- ter in focus. According to Yamashita, the characters of the novel “all started as  ‘types,’ even as caricatures, in the same way the media represents us” (Glixman  2007). Although Yamashita aimed at criticizing the ethnic framing by the media,  the author herself is criticized for the technique of parodying ‘ethno-linguistic’  stereotypes. This form of mimetic imitation, resemblance, or mirror effect, how- ever, is considered as a truthful literary resemblance of reality (Sturm-Trigonakis  2007: 147) because the polyglossia creates closeness to the characters. Thus, the  novel’s politics of identity and ethnic representation leave the readership torn  “between multicultural mockery and cosmopolitan embrace of diversity”  (Raussert 2011: 105).  No white American protagonists are incorporated in a former predominantly  white American L.A. Instead, the novel focuses on the city’s often under- represented minorities, emphasizing those ethnic groups with which the author is  most acquainted, such as Asian and Mexican Americans. Yamashita wanted to  turn the media’s “background material” (Glixman 2007) into main stories and  characters by representing those who have been neglected in the city’s historical  and literary past (Adams 2007: 264), including Africans, Asians, and Latin  Americans as well as the homeless (Glixman 2007). With its intertwined story of  different ethnicities collaborating across class lines and political borders, the  novel challenges the literary tradition of the city and “the white middle-class  dominant perspective of ‘American’ society” (Chae 2008: 91).  The novel manages to translate the complex cultural identity of Bobby for  the reader’s imagination. The Chinese speaks Spanish like a Mexican, demon- strating his linguistic flexibility and hybrid identity. In chapter 2, entitled ‘Ko- reatown’, Bobby is introduced as an “Asian dude. Kinda skinny. Short, yeah. But  so what? Dark glasses. Cigarette in his mouth.” (TRO: 14). He speaks in brief  sentences, typified by an absence of articles, with short words, no extras or fancy  elements, and many colloquial, more informal than formal elements, such as  ‘kinda’ and ‘gonna.’ He is displayed as someone who is constantly working with  and against established stereotypes.  The following quote illustrates how the novel utilizes common misconcep- tions and stereotypes to display cultural diversity but also to translate the cultural  diversity of the characters to the reader’s imagination:    </page> <page sequence="22"> 186 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    If you know your Asian, you look at Bobby.

(TRO: 15)    After the confusion and attempts at explanation, the narrator sums up Bobby’s  cultural identity as being “Chinese from Singapore with a Vietnam name speak- ing like a Mexican living in Koreatown” (TRO: 15). Hence, language functions  as an excellent indicator for cultural diversity. Bobby is fluent in Spanish, sound- ing like a Chicano (TRO: 8). Thus, he can be considered a hybrid of Asian  American and Chicano who has created a ‘third space’ for himself in the United  States.   Whereas all characters of the novel are “transculturated” (Löbbermann 2008:  277), Bobby is the most culturally diverse of all characters. Bobby is not an ‘or- dinary’ Asian American (TRO 15) but is depicted as having “a multi-defined  identity” (Chae 2008: 91). He makes use of his diversity, sometimes even oppor- tunistically. Hence, on the micro-level, Bobby’s identity has become a mixture  of various cultural inspirations. He is not torn but seizes the opportunities offered  to him due to his ethnic appearance, for example when he invents his alias to  pass as a political refugee. Like a chameleon adapting to his background, he suc- cessfully exploits the Americans’ blindness to varieties within the Asian Ameri- can community. He claims to belong to another Asian heritage, taking full ad- vantage of American support and the sympathy of one Asian group while simul- taneously circumventing politically-induced racism against another Asian minor- ity, caused by the Vietnam War. The narrator thus interweaves hidden ironic re- marks about the common misconception that all Asians appear alike.   The description of the character Bobby goes beyond the concept of cultural  ‘hybridity’ and ‘in-betweenness’ because the “Asian Latino” (Sadowski-Smith  2008: 62) is a border-crossing character who cannot be described as either-or,  protesting against clear categorization. Instead, the character’s ethnic intermix- ture is stressed. Even Bobby’s last name “Ngu” functions as a pun (Rody 2009:  viii). This pronunciation as ‘new’ is an allusion to his new form of identity as an  interethnic person. Thus, the focus is shifted from one ethnicity to a hybrid state  and from there to a global cultural mélange of various influences. It proves that  </page> <page sequence="23"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 187    an individual’s identity can be more easily expressed in a mixture of different  cultural manifestations than in categories.   Bobby and his marriage are the embodiment of the similarities and parallels  between Asians and Mexicans in America. His wife Rafaela is a Chicana of Af- rican slave heritage. She is very educated but nevertheless works as Gabriel’s  housekeeper. She represents the modern Mexican woman and discovers the ille- gal organ transplant conspiracy. Rafaela and Bobby, the “pan-Asian” who  speaks Spanish fluently, and their son Sol are part of the visible minority, suffer- ing from social invisibility. As the HyperContexts reveals, Bobby’s chapters are  full of work metaphors and consumerism (e.g. TRO 79). Together, the workahol- ics stand for “cheap, immigrant labor” (Lee 2011: 321) of the so-called “dream- addicted Los Angeles middle class” (Davis 1990: 20).  With the seven different narrative voices and modes, the novel achieves  coming as close as possible to representing the global (Raussert 2011: 108). The  author manages to portray the wide variety of the diverse characters and their  different languages in a written form, creating an equality of cultural differences  by devoting the same amount of chapters to each of the characters. Language  thus functions as a ‘point of view’ and as a means to question the dominance of  one perspective. Bakhtin’s notion of the novel as a ‘zone of contact’ (1981:  27f.), in which different languages, cultures, and ideologies intersect, is a re- minder of the crucial characteristic of the global city as a cultural node in a glob- al network of flows.  Section 7.2.3 on ‘The Global’ examines how globalization affects economic,  political, and social networks in the literary global city of Los Angeles. With the  network-like structure of the plot, an ‘interethnic collaboration’ is formed that  operates “beyond rigid racial/ethnic boundaries” (Chae 2008: 93). The author fo- cuses on cultural diversity accelerated by globalization, its opportunities and  challenges. The novel thus comes as close as possible to representing the global  not only with the different narrative voices and modes (Raussert 2011: 108) but  also by using the network metaphor for the different globalization processes and  for the forms of representations of the global, portrayed by the different charac- ters and their relationships.    8.2.3 The Global    The network-like interaction of the culturally-diverse cast is closely connected to  the network-like structure of the novel. Seven seemingly independent characters  and stories converge into one team, providing one solution to complex border- crossing problems in the end, each filling in pieces of the whole picture. Thus,  </page> <page sequence="24"> 188 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    parallels are established to concepts such as the ‘rhizome of culture’, globaliza- tion as ‘hybridization’ and ‘heterogeneity’, a transcultural mosaic, or global mé- lange. The borderless networking in a globalizing age is mirrored by the inter- connectedness of the different characters, their relationships, but also by a globe- like, border-crossing orange.  Whereas the novel features different themes of globalization, its structure re- sembles globalization as such because the various narrative threads are intercon- nected and interwoven, converging in the end. The three forces and innovations  of globalization are depicted.60 The increased mobility of people, criminals, or- anges, and information enhances the impression of a growing connectivity of the  world. Thus, a global consciousness is created. Moreover, technological ad- vancements, the economy, and politics contribute to the erosion of borders as  well as to a redefinition of time and space when, in the end, everything happens  simultaneously.  Whereas the city of L.A. serves as a “metonym for the global” (Wallace  2001: 153) and the protagonists of the book exemplify the diversity of the world,  the airport serves as an example of globalization processes in urban space.61 The  scene describing the international airport LAX functions as a metaphor for the  potpourri of cultures living, arriving, and passing through the city: “KAL from  Seoul ARRIVED. VARIG from Rio ARRIVED. QANTAS from Sydney DE- LAYED. JAL from Tokyo LANDING. MEXICANA from Mexico City LAND- ED” (TRO 86). The author’s detailed description of the arriving flights and air- lines in capital letters creates a strong illusion of immediacy, global connectivity,  and cultural multiplicity.  The novel also addresses the various effects of globalization, employing iro- ny to criticize economically-driven globalization as Westernization or Neo- Colonization. Thus, the reader learns that Mexican toilet bowls are cheaper if  purchased in the U.S. and then shipped to Mexico than those purchased in Mexi- co from the start. The novel also raises the critique that globalization possibly  harms the globe and humankind, providing a list of negative side effects, includ- ing accelerated drug traffic (TRO: 146f). The major threat in the book, however,  is lethal narcotics hidden in healthy Mexican oranges. The fruit’s globe-like  shape (TRO: 12), which functions as a symbol for the world, therefore also be-                                                               60  For more information, please see Section 2.2 on the ‘Global Consensus’ of globaliza- tion and its effects.  61  This exemplification of the diversity of the world constitutes a similarity to Herman  Melville’s Moby Dick (1851) in which the diversity of different people (yet only men  at that time) on the ship represents the whole world.  </page> <page sequence="25"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 189    comes representative of the downside that globalization can bring to the world,  literally bearing dangerous elements.  The book points out how much impact local events can have on the rest of  the world. The so-called butterfly effect resembles the forces and innovations of  globalization that, for example, accelerate transportation of information and the  connectivity of the world, linking “the myriad small everyday actions of millions  with the fates of distant, unknown others” (Tomlinson 2001: 25). In the novel,  this is explained by the spread of news when the threat of spiked oranges is al- tered and elevated in the news in an imaginary cycle of every twenty-two  minutes. Buzzworm follows the development of the story from “spiked orange  alert” to “spiked orange scare” to “illegal orange scare” to “illegal alien orange  scare,” and finally to “Death oranges” (TRO: 138-141; emphasis original). This  effect illustrates how local events can trigger global attention, creating an im- pression of immediacy, acceleration of information flows, and interconnected- ness. Within hours, a healthy orange is turned into something lethal while blam- ing illegal immigrants at the same time because both, the poisoned orange and il- legal immigrants from Mexico or Latin America, are considered “illegal tres- passers” (Chae 2008: 99).  The different perspectives on globalization are embodied by different charac- ters in the novel, such as the border-crossing immigrants Arcangel, Rafaela, and  Bobby or the complimentary couple of Emi and Gabriel. The character Emi, for  example, views globalization as Westernization and predominantly as a process  of Americanization in which different cultural fragments are identified and  standardized to fit many other cultures. According to her, economic globaliza- tion is “about selling things: Reebok, Pepsi, Chevrolet, AllState, Pampers, Pollo,  Loco, Levis, Fritos, [...]” (TRO: 126). This resembles the standardization or ho- mogenization approach of globalization.  Emi is a representative of the new network society in the “world media city”  (Taylor 2004: 57), whose’ “networked computing” (Ling 2012: 137) functions as  an alternative to ethnic categorizations. According to Manuel Castells, a ‘net- work society’ is made of social networks based on communication technologies  (2004: 3), and in the novel, the young Asian American represents the digital age,  in which news is spread around the world in an instant. She works as an editor at  the local TV station, helps to reveal the organ smuggle, and thereby later discov- ers that Manzanar Murakami is her grandfather. Instead of being nostalgic about  </page> <page sequence="26"> 190 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    her heritage, Emi prefers to circumvent ethnic pigeonholing by being identified  by her profession or use of technology.62  Emi and Gabriel together represent two sides of globalization, respectively  accepting and distrusting technological advancements or change. Whereas Emi  is considered “hypercontemporary” (Adams 2007: 260), constantly and ‘fearless- ly’ making use of new technologies, such as the Internet, email, or emoticons,  Gabriel is associated with investigation in a black-and-white colored 1930s de- tective noir style. Gabriel chooses burgers over exotic food that he cannot trans- late on the menu, thus revealing his conservatism and resistance to change. Emi  compliments their relationship and his investigative abilities by showing the re- porter the future of “a paperless existence” (TRO: 23), in which the global flow  of things, e.g. the news, is vastly accelerated.  Through the border-crossing character Rafaela and Arcangel, who carries the  orange northwards, accelerated immigration and the prejudice that Mexican and  other immigrants are facing are depicted (TRO: 211), highlighting the differ- ences between the North and the South in the globalization process. In chapter  33, titled ‘To Dream – America,’ the history of the Mexican-American border is  explained in detail (TRO: 161f.) and the United States is criticized heavily for its  border politics (TRO: 199-201; 161). Mexico and the South is significantly rep- resented as two-fold, torn between the future and hundreds years of tradition, by  Rafaela, the brave, smart, modern Mexican woman and Arcangel, the old, tradi- tional, and respected Mexico, who speaks in metaphors and poetry, is seemingly  different, and mysterious. The novel also emphasizes the topic of immigration  and racism when describing the fact that (Mexican) immigrants struggle to be  welcomed in the United States: “We’re not wanted here. Nobody respects our  work. Say we cost money. Live on welfare. It’s a lie. We pay taxes” (TRO: 80).  Globalization as a phenomenon of a focus on world-wide capitalism and a  process of Westernization is predominantly criticized through the roles and per- spectives of Arcangel, who fights against a mythically anthropomorphized  NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). Arcangel’s chapters are sig- nificantly told in a third-person narration because he represents 500 years of Lat- in American history (Ling 2012: 121). His voice is described as “a jumble of un- known dialects, guttural and whining, Latin mixed with every aboriginal, coloni- al, slave, or immigrant tongue” (TRO: 47). He thus manages to speak for the old,  the traditional, the colonized, the conservative, and for things that are severely  threatened, affected, altered, or even destroyed by globalization.                                                                62  For more information on Emi’s relationship to her heritage and her vision of being  ‘anti-multicultural,’ please see Section 8.2.5 on ‘These Lines.’  </page> <page sequence="27"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 191    Arcangel polarizes the reader because he is bizarre but respected for repre- senting the entirety of Latin American history. Inspired by elements of magical  realism and Mexican myths, he has mysterious holes in his body that can pull a  truck (TRO: 211), which creates a feeling of something uncanny, unknown, exot- ic, or of supernaturalism, disgust, and fear. He is mysteriously described as “an  actor and prankster, mimic and comic, freak, a one man circus act” (TRO: 47).  When Arcangel dreams of the orange, however, he immediately understands its  significance and the connection to the tropic.  Arcangel is constantly crossing borders. On his trip North, the “multi-ethnic  Latin American wanderer through time and space” (Raussert 2011: 101) stops at  a Mexican bar called “Misery &amp; Hunger” that serves only American conven- ience products, such as hamburgers with ketchup and beer (TRO: 130f.). This  shows how Mexico has been influenced by the American economy, capitalism,  and consumerism and how the American economic domination moves across  borders (Chae 2008: 100). Arcangel does not like this influence because he val- ues Mexican habits and resists change. Thus, he confronts SUPERNAFTA, who  aims at a free flow of people, commodities, and money between Canada, the  U.S., and Mexico.  In his role of the historical person of El Gran Mojado, Arcangel confronts  SUPERNAFTA in a Mexican-style lucha libre wrestling match (TRO: 232) to  fight false promises, corruption, and exploitation by the United States. El Gran  Mojado, or “The Big Wetback,” is an ‘economic refugee’ (Anzaldua 1987: 33;  Chae 2008: 99). He functions as a counterforce to American capitalist domina- tion and expansion, fighting against consumerist homogenization, artificial free- dom with a combination of liberty and consumerism, and dependence on Ameri- can capital (Chae 2008: 100f.).  The clash of the North versus the South, which significantly takes place “at  the very borders” (TRO: 256) of the Pacific Rim Auditorium, represents exces- sive consumption versus poverty and crime. Supporters of NAFTA claim that  employment opportunities in Mexico will increase when more products are sold  to North America, simultaneously counteracting Mexican-American immigration  (Adler et al 1992: 796). In the novel, NAFTA is criticized as money-focused in- stead of working for the well-being of the people (TRO: 133), in particular with  regard to the Mexican population or immigration. SUPERNAFTA, however,  claims that the South belongs to the North (TRO: 132). The human organs’ trade  illustrates this interdependent relationship, in which one country is exploited and  the other benefits. This example is representative of the convergence and inter- connectivity of the North and the South and the whole world.  </page> <page sequence="28"> 192 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    El Gran Mojado does not survive when fighting against SUPERNAFTA be- cause traditions need to change. Arcangel’s awareness that he has to die to make  room for something new represents the change induced by globalization. This  economic border metaphor of the United States and Mexico symbolizes the  global marketplace and the divide between more and less developed countries.  Hence, the novel is being critical about American culture and white American  hegemony as well as about globalization as a mere Americanization process.  However, the last chapter’s title, ‘American Express – Mi Casa/Su Casa,’ shows  that globalization a phenomenon of Westernization affects everyone alike be- cause “mi” (‘my’) globalization is “su” (‘your’) globalization.   The novel’s description of the literary global city of Los Angeles in a global- izing age is as fluid as its narrative mode because it does without classical imag- es of urban space (Raussert 2011: 108). Instead, the whole geography is moved.  How the novel redefines urban literature by presenting a dynamic concept of  space is examined in the next section, ‘ElastiCity.’    8.2.4 ElastiCity    Amazing thing was everybody in L.A. was  walking. They just had no choice. There wasn’t  a transportation artery that a vehicle could pass  through. It was a big-time thrombosis. Massive  stroke. Heart attack. You name it. The whole  system was coagulating then and there. [...]  Streets’d become unrecognizable from an auto- motive standpoint. Only way to navigate it was  to feel the streets with your own two feet.  (TRO: 218F.)    The poetics of place play a major role in Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Or- ange because they reveal the interconnectedness of time, space, and cultural di- versity in a globalizing age. As illustrated in the above-mentioned quote, every- thing converges in L.A. in a huge traffic jam and, therefore, the city becomes the  center of the world. Yamashita claims that the “idea of a changing geography  would be a way to demonstrate very physically the change in Los Angeles” in  recent years (Yamashita 1999). She used geography to move borders and the  conception of cultural diversity. She decided to alter L.A.’s landscape as soon as  an orange is moved north, thereby highlighting the impact of accelerated border  traffic, immigration, and globalization.  </page> <page sequence="29"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 193    The section’s title ‘elastiCity’ describes how time and space become “elas- tic” (TRO: 123f.) in the imagined global city of Los Angeles and the border re- gion of the U.S. and Mexico. With the ‘coming-together’ (Lee 2011: 323) of the  North and the South, time and space collide when Arcangel carries the orange  and thus the Southern Hemisphere with the Tropic of Orange northwards.63 This  dramatic change is sensed by the different protagonists. Once the orange at Ga- briel’s house had disappeared, Rafaela soon notices “this elasticity of the land  and of time. This sensation of timelessness, of yawning distances, of haunting  fear, of danger” (TRO: 149; emphasis added), foreshadowing the threat of the il- legal border-crossing organ trade. Similarly, Manzanar had “an uncanny sense of  the elasticity of the moment, of time and space” (TRO: 123; emphasis added). He  could feel the time-space distortion and a possible apocalypse dooming from the  chaotic convergence because he was able to “see the undulating pattern and the  changing geography corrupting the sun’s shadows, confusing time, so that all  events should happen and end at the same time” (TRO: 206).  This time and space shift constitutes a force of globalization.64 The distortion  called ‘annihilation of space by time’ by Marx (1973) and ‘time-space compres- sion’ by Harvey (1989) is explained in the novel through a graphic description:  “Streets stretched and shrunk this way and that. Someone put this city in the  washer/dryer. Shrunk 50% in places. Then ironed it out 200% in others” (TRO:  230). As Gabriel observes, the geography of the city of L.A. is changed into a  “distorted version of downtown. At least that’s what the street names indicate”  (TRO: 227). The phenomenon is also earlier noticed by the smart reporter Emi:  “I mean the length of the day. [...] It’s got something to do with time. Place.”  (TRO: 61). Hence, time and place are defined anew and globalization magically  affects geography. Everything is moved north, converging in the city of L.A.,  which is representative of the convergence of the whole world in “The World  City,’ thereby exposing the interconnectedness of the local and the global.  Buzzworm, who has a naturally strong sense of time, collects watches, and  keeps one for every occasion, can also sense the distraction of time. After  fighting for his country in Vietnam, the African American is marked as an out- cast in society (TRO: 217) due to the anti-war sentiment in the 1970s. The novel  is critical of American politics and society, contravening common ethnic stereo- types when the veteran is described as being down-to-earth, helping whenever he                                                                63  For more information on the significance of the novel’s title, please see Section 8.2.5  on ‘These Lines.’  64  For more information on the perceived convergence as one force of globalization,  please see Chapter 2.2 on ‘Global Consensus.’  </page> <page sequence="30"> 194 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    can, and never giving up. He calls himself ‘Angel of Mercy’ and functions as the  Robin Hood of the district in a time of fierce interethnic riots in Los Angeles.  The veteran fights for his home area and against corruption. His connection to  oranges is the admiration of palm trees for their sense of time, such as the natural  sensing of seasons. He collaborates with Gabriel Balboa, being ‘his man on the  scene’ in L.A., observing how the relationship between time and space changes.  He manages to connect the drugs to the oranges, revealing the lethal smuggle.  Buzzworm is listening to the radio constantly, which is a metaphor for his  understanding of different cultures because he enjoys any kind of music style  and can deal with any kind of person. He acknowledges, respects, and under- stands diversity. He has interethnic appeal and shows respect when he listens to  “rap, jazz, R&amp;B, talk shows, classical, NPR, religious channels, Mexican, even  the Korean channel. Didn’t know a thing they were saying, but he liked the  sounds. Fact is, he listened to the sounds so much, he could imitate them” (TRO:  29). Thus, he has a good ear for cultural differences. He understands in the sense  of listening to and comprehending cultural diversity on the radio and on the  streets.  In the novel, the city of Los Angeles and its freeway system is anthropomor- phized, being described as “a great root system, an organic living entity” (TRO:  37). The novel compares the freeway to the city’s veins like Thomas Pynchon’s  The Crying of Lot 49, which defines it as “a vein nourishing the mainliner L.A.,  keeping it happy, coherent, protected from pain, or whatever passes” (1966: 15;  Adams 2007: 248). Therefore, and as illustrated in the introductory quote to this  section, the notorious L.A. traffic jam is described using the metaphor of a hu- man body with an artery and diseases connected to the blood system, such as a  thrombosis, stroke, or heart attack, thereby emphasizing the anthropomorphism  of “the great heartbeat of a great city” (TRO: 35). Hence, when the freeway is  jammed like a blood clot blocks a vein, the city and its society are revealed as  ‘sick’ from a standstill.  It is no coincidence that the city is described in a “language of organicity”  (Lee 2011: 326) because the homeless person Manzanar who conducts the free- way traffic used to work as a surgeon. Once a respected member of society, this  constitutes a paradoxical reversal of his status; the man who formerly saved peo- ple’s lives and now disgusts them makes sense of traffic instead of bodies. All of  a sudden, he understands the system, the pattern, the flow of things by conduct- ing traffic. With this symphony of traffic, Manzanar acknowledges and under- stands the interconnectedness of urban life in the global city. Being aware of the  global connectivity of the world, the Asian American represents “the symbolic  </page> <page sequence="31"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 195    nodal point in which all of humanity, in a spiral of ever-increasing scope, is  joined” (Lee 2011: 324; italics original).  Manzanar’s unique perception of the world in musical chords is another ap- proach to understanding globalization. He makes sense of traffic in his own spe- cial way, seeing patterns that transform chaos into order. To him, the freeway  “was nothing more than a great writhing concrete dinosaur and nothing less than  the greatest orchestra on Earth” (TRO: 37). The homeless seems to be the most  marginalized character of all. In 1984, however, Los Angeles was considered the  “homeless capital” by the U.S. department of Housing and Urban Development  (Halle 2003: 12) and thus, as the novel states, “no one was more at home in L.A.  than this man” (TRO: 36). The novel thus gives the character a voice because he  can conduct symphonies made from traffic noise and sees things that others can- not see (TRO: 57). The old man significantly derives his alias from the Manzanar  concentration camp in California, where he was born when his parents were in- terned during World War II (TRO: 110). Following Pearl Harbor, massive num- bers of L.A. residents of Japanese descent were deported to internment camps  and kept there until 1945. Nowadays, Japanese Americans are considered part of  the ‘model minority,’ having major financial influence in Los Angeles (Abu- Lughod 1999: 251). Thus, the author does not avoid talking about the atrocities  Japanese Americans had faced.  Similar to the mayoral candidate John Kwang in Lee’s Native Speaker  (1995) who transgresses his designated space as an Asian American in New  York, Manzanar is introduced as a powerful border-crossing character. As a  conductor of the cars on the freeway, he knows and ‘regulates’ the major infra- structure of the city. Moreover, Manzanar also similarly identifies a kind of  common vernacular of the global city that is “an equivalent reproduction of a  perfect Babel or jam session of sounds, discourses, and realities” (Manzanas  Calvo et al 2011: 61). Thus, compatible to Kwang’s creation of an ethnic minori- ty vernacular, the novel creates another form of vernacular typical of a global  city that is determined in auditive, industrial, and mechanical terms.  The freeway, its structure, and the automobile are of major significance for  the imagined global city of L.A. The freeway as such is synonymous with end- less mobility and the extension of the westward movement by American settlers,  driven by the concept of ‘Manifest Destiny,’ enforcing freedom as an ur- American value (Manzanas Calvo et al 2011: 54). The last chapter that focuses  on Manzanar is named ‘Sig Alert,’ refers to the infamous L.A. traffic conditions  and traffic jams, which are a key element of Los Angeles freeway culture and  commuting routine since the 1950s (Gottlieb 2007: 174). By the 1920s, Los An- geles had the country’s highest automobile registration (Soja 2000: 128), and in  </page> <page sequence="32"> 196 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    a city with no unifying center, the freeway turned into the connecting link and  thus became the “new center of the city” (Gottlieb 2007: 175).  The novel’s freeway block by the homeless is a very unusual interaction tak- ing place in the global city of Los Angeles. In contrast to Toronto and New  York, individuals do not usually meet on the streets, but the novel reverses this  peculiarity. As the socio-cultural critical L.A. episode movie ‘Crash’ (2004)  shows, a traffic jam, freeway block, or crash is needed for cultural encounters to  happen. As illustrated in the introductory quote to this section, the massive  crossing of vehicles is substituted by immobility and a standstill of cars. This  immobility of traffic, however, also represents mobility. A pedestrian life devel- ops. Moreover, the homeless are crossing borders of their determined and mar- ginalized space in the city. They mobilize their stigma of belonging to a ghetto  and change fixed definitions of using cars for driving purposes only. Thus, with  this move, “the nomads, the representatives of the non-city, have trespassed the  visible and invisible lines that circumscribed them” (Manzanas Calvo et al 2011:  58). With this redefinition of space, the distinction between race and class are  redefined, thereby questioning existing categorizations. Thus, the invisible are  made visible when the homeless carjack and control the freeways.  The reader is in a hybrid situation, torn between sympathy for the homeless,  who live in abandoned cars, and the car-owners, who want their property back.  This dichotomy functions as a metaphor for the strong division of the globe be- tween consumerism and mere survival, such as in ‘First World’ and ‘Third  World’ countries. Whereas cars are a product of everyday convenience to one  half of the globe, the other half struggles for mere survival and basic needs, such  as accommodation and nutrition, which is represented by the homeless growing  vegetables in the car engines. As a result, a small grass-roots revolution is taking  place. The conflict between the car owners and the homeless in the celebrity city  of L.A. represents these two contradicting worlds depicted in the following  quote.    As the homeless flocked onto the freeway, there were also the usual questions of shelter  and jobs, drug rehabilitation, and the closing of the mental health facilities. And as car  owners watched on TV sets or from the edges of the freeway canyon, there were the usual  questions of police protection, insurance coverage, and acts of God. (TRO: 122)    The homeless can be compared to colonization. They grow their own colony,  settling down, naming streets, and planting crops. This functions as a strong cri- tique of colonization and domination in form of irony. For Americans in general  and Los Angelenos in particular, cars are their “own home away from home”  </page> <page sequence="33"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 197    (Lee 2011: 326), resembling key values, such as mobility, freedom, and inde- pendence. Moreover, the freeway traffic is symptomatic for the restlessness and  mobility of the imagined global city (Raussert 2011: 105). Thus, carjacking is  “the ultimate American violence” (Zukin 1995: 43). The homeless, however, are  portrayed as an anti-globalization movement because they bring the symbol of  mobility and economic globalization to a halt by changing diapers and growing  vegetables in high-end cars, such as Porsches or Corvettes. Hence, with the elas- ticity of time and, in particular, space, the novel also manages to interweave  L.A.’s image as a city of differences and paradoxes.  When the homeless are stopped by helicopters and the police, the revolution  of space and class is violently stopped, enacting scenes of the 1992 L.A. riots.  Thus, the freeways of Los Angeles, which have “long occupied the contempo- rary imagination as the ills of chaotic urban living” (Lee 2011: 326), are again  associated with something negative in the novel. Helicopters flying over the  freeway, surveillance systems, video cameras, and the aimed control of public  space can be identified as implicit references to Mike Davis’ City of Quartz. Da- vis argues that “‘security’ becomes a positional good” for the rich, as in the  many so-called ‘gates communities,’ and the concept of fear and threat is mar- keted as an industry (1990: 224f.), enforcing existing social boundaries in spatial  terms.  This heterogeneous quality of Los Angeles contributed to the 1992 Los An- geles riots, of which Soja raised a question eight years later: given the “volatile  cityspace produced by new urbanization processes, [...] what has prevented the  postmetropolis from exploding more frequently and more violently that it has  over the past decade?” (2000: 299). With the novel’s depiction of the scenes of  uprising like in 1992 and the collaboration of the seven different characters, the  emphasis is put “on the necessity of forming a political alliance beyond ethnic  differences” (Chae 2008: 104) and class in order to stabilize politics and to pre- vent an apocalypse.  Magical realism functions as an important instrument in the novel to show  that the North and the South are dependent and interconnected in an age of glob- alization with flows of money, goods, people, and ideas but also to challenge  traditional concepts of culture, time, and space, in which borders collapse and  boundaries are reconfigured, thereby envisioning new utopias (Benito et al 2009:  87). With this technique of visualizing globalization and its effects by moving or  changing geographies, parallels to Edward Soja’s dynamic notion of ‘space’  (1989; 2000) can be identified. His term ‘postmetropolis,’ for example, which is  inspired by the global city of Los Angeles, shows how globalization “brings all  the world’s peripheries into the center, drawing in what was once considered  </page> <page sequence="34"> 198 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    ‘elsewhere’ to its own symbolic zone” (Soja 2000: 250). In the novel, this pro- cess takes place, symbolizing the collision and convergence of the ‘First World’  and ‘Third World’ in ‘The World City’ of L.A. The novel, however, not only  features a new, dynamic definition of space in a postmodern L.A. but also an ac- companying redefinition of borders and thus ethnic categorizations. How the  ‘Tropic of Orange’ as one of ‘these lines’ is moved and therefore reconfigured is  elaborated in the last section.    8.2.5 These Lines    Tied fast to these lines. (...) What are these god- damn lines anyway? What do they connect?  What do they divide? What’s he holding on to?  (TRO: 268; EMPHASIS ADDED)    The ‘lines’ Bobby is holdings in the quote play a crucial role in the novel. Lines,  a synonym for borders in the physical and metaphorical sense, implicate bilateral  or transnational politics, border traffic and immigration, or identity conflicts. In  this section, the significance of the novel’s title is examined because the ‘Tropic  of Orange’ constitutes one of ‘these lines.’ The Tropic of Orange’s development  is explored; a development into a ‘third space’ in which accelerated border traf- fic and a shifting of borders take place on different levels.  The idea of the plot and the title of the novel originated from the time when  Yamashita and her husband lived in the Brazilian megacity São Paulo, a city  through which the Tropic of Capricorn runs. When Yamashita moved to L.A.,  the story about an orange growing at a geographical border moved north with her  to Mazatlán, Mexico, which is on the Tropic of Cancer (Glixman 2007). In the  novel, the tropic line was renamed the ‘Tropic of Orange,’ thereby highlighting  the significance of the orange. The tropic is introduced when the housekeeper  Rafaela sees and describes the fine line on the property of Gabriel Balboa’s va- cation getaway that seems to be connected to an orange on the tree: “a line – fin- er than the thread of a spider web – pulled with delicate tautness. It was most  visible in the dewy mornings as the sun rose in the east; at other times, it was  barely visible. But she always sensed its presence” (TRO: 12). The imaginary  boundary continues on both sides of the orange, forming a visible line, thereby  creating a border metaphor.  The reporter planting a tree that carries one orange directly at the tropic line  signifies the creation of Gabriel’s own colony. The reader is reminded of Co- lumbus, who brought the first orange tree to America when he conquered the  </page> <page sequence="35"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 199    continent in 1492 (Rauch 1998: 28). Gabriel’s purchase of the land close to the  Tropic of Orange is ironically described in terms of colonization, too. The fol- lowing quote explains his imperial domination of an exotic place: “Gabriel felt a  spontaneous, sudden passion for the acquisition of the land, the sensation of a  timeless vacation, the erotic tastes of chili pepper and salty breezes, and for  Mexico” (TRO: 5). Thus, as some critics claim, the orange in the novel also  functions as an object of revenge (Ling 2012: 125) for the colonization started by  Columbus and forwarded by the hegemony of America and globalization as  Westernization. The house situated at the Tropic of Cancer also symbolizes Ga- briel’s quest for paradise in nostalgic Mexico. He dreams the American dream  and that of upward mobility (Hauser 2006: 12). Nevertheless, he clings to the  past in search for his Mexican roots. Thus, Gabriel’s ‘inner division’ of having  two identities, Mexican and American, is also visualized by the line on his prop- erty.  The orange creates a ‘third space,’ being the symbolic connecting link of the  tropic line and of different definitions of space and time as well as a through its  symbolic role as mediator between the North and the South, different cultures,  and histories, This space is established by the movement of borders and the  transformation of geography when the orange is dragged north. The orange es- tablishes a life of its own (TRO: 13f) and thus becomes the novel’s symbolic  center (Raussert 2011: 100). Then, the known geography is transformed into  something new that is negotiated by the time and space shift caused by the glob- alization force. Homi Bhabha elaborates upon this perspective in the following  quote.    The importance of hybridity is not to be able to trace two original moments from which  the third emerges, rather hybridity to me is the third space which enables other positions to  emerge. This third space displaces the histories that constitute it, and sets up new struc- tures of authority, new political initiatives, which are inadequately understood through re- ceived wisdom. (Bhabha 1990: 211)    Figuratively speaking, when the threads that originated in the orange forming the  tropic line are cut, borders are erased geographically and metaphorically. Indeci- sion and in-betweenness are circumvented. The cultural contact zone is moved to  the global city of L.A., and a hybrid discourse can be initiated that encompasses  the whole multitude of ethnicities. The seven protagonists investigate together in  order to find the criminals who smuggle drugs hidden in oranges and illegally  trade human organs in plastic coolers. The message is transported that success  lies in diversity and that the problems of the world can be solved with the power  </page> <page sequence="36"> 200 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    of networking and the collaboration of the various different people in the world.  Hence, a collage of the very different and yet distinct personalities is created in  which everyone is working together to save the world. Thus, the emphasis is on  unity, while maintaining the cultural diversity of the individual. This can be  compared to the concept of ‘hybridization’ and to that of a ‘rhizome of culture’  (Deleuze et al: 1987).  The novel is also inspired by Anzaldúa’s border metaphor because it manag- es to portray culturally diverse characters situated in the border region of the  American Southwest. The novel deals with the process of identity formation  across those borders. The author celebrates cultural diversity while illustrating  that things are changing and need to be changing in a globalizing age. The novel  depicts characters that cross racial boundaries as well as national borders and  cultural spaces (Ty et al 2009: 136). Moreover, a border conflict usually entails  growing up between cultures (Anzaldúa 1987: 6), mostly accompanied by a gen- erational, language, and integration conflict.  Gloria Anzaldúa illustrates that the border areas provide a ‘third space’ in  which hybridization is practiced.    To live in the Borderlands means to    Put chile in the borscht   eat wholewheat tortillas   speak Tex-Mex with a Brooklyn accent   be stopped by la migra at the border checkpoints. (Anzaldúa 1987: 194)    Borderlands are crucial when it comes to cultural identity formation because  “border zones are the meeting places of different organizational modes [...] hy- brid meeting places of state sovereignty and transnational enterprise”  (Nederveen Pieterse 2004: 67). When Arcangel carries the orange north, the bor- der discourse is also moved. Thus, borders are shifted physically and metaphori- cally. As a result, Asian Americans as well as other minorities are included in  the border position and transcultural discourse because “the border narrative  [goes] beyond that of Mexican/North-American polarities to consider its effects  on Latin American, Asian and Southeast-Asian migrants, and neighborhood lo- cals and transients in Los Angeles” (Gier et al 1998).  The novel manages to illustrate the overlapping of histories, experiences, and  social or political integration of Asian Americans and Mexican Americans as  well as further immigrants in the concurrent urban and border contact zone of  Los Angeles. Rafaela and Bobby, or Gabriel and Emi, for example, are both  interethnic couples of the lower or upper middle-class who show the difficulties  </page> <page sequence="37"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 201    and similarities of life in Los Angeles (Sadowski-Smith 2008: 63). Similar to  Lee’s Native Speaker, which shows parallels between African American and  Asian American suffering and marginalization, Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange  manages to evoke a shared understanding of the cultures of the physical border  region and those many more cultures impacted by borders in a wider, metaphori- cal sense, thus creating “interethnic alliances” (Ling 2012: 137).  Guillermo Gómez-Peña, a Latin American writer and performance artist re- nowned for his notion of a ‘borderless future,’ in which separating lines and cat- egorizations do not exist (1995: 175), inspired the author and Arcangel’s charac- ter (Gier and Tejeda 1998). Similar to Lee’s Native Speaker, Yamashita’s novel  presents an intertextual reference in its prologue. The meta-logical epigraph to  Gómez-Peña’s The New World Border (1995; TRO: 198) is meant to address the  reader and to provide a context for the novel’s plot but is not further explained  within the novel. Thus, compatible to Gómez-Peña’s work, the readership is  forced “to examine the junctions of society, culture and language, and to ques- tion the static notion of identity” (Cole 2011: 89).  Through the character Emi, the novel tries to do without ethnic borders by  arguing against established concepts like ‘multiculturalism.’ Emi controversially  claims that she hates “being multicultural” (TRO: 128) because she disregards  people that make assumptions about others with regard to their skin color. Alt- hough Emi considers herself as “so distant from the Asian female stereotype – it  was questionable if she even had an identity” (TRO: 19), she is connected to her  heritage but she is not, in contrast to her co-worker and lover Gabriel, as roman- tic about it (Glixman 2007). Instead, her controversial arguments, such as “may- be I’m not Japanese American. Maybe I got switched in the hospital” (TRO: 21),  underline her insistence on a rethinking of cultural pigeonholing. She “liked try- ing to be antimulticultural” (TRO: 21) because she does not want to be catego- rized as a ‘J.A.’ (Japanese American), thereby circumventing categorizations in  general and cultural stigmatization in particular.  Gabriel Balboa, for instance, does not connect Emi to her ethnic community  at first because she does not really fit into the tight-knit Asian American society.  Instead, Emi is a very individualistic, young, self-confident, and successful  Asian American woman. Moreover, the young woman “identifies herself  through technology to avoid an ethnical identification” (Hauser 2006: 7). Con- trasting the Asian American stereotype of being silenced, for example, Emi uses  explicit language in public. She has a big mouth, raises her voice, and thus does  not remain silent, as female Asian Americans are commonly stereotyped, as seen  in her mother commands, “no J.A. speaks like that” (TRO: 21).  </page> <page sequence="38"> 202 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    The author gives Asian American women a voice, working against prevailing  clichés. Emi’s character circumvents and breaks all rules when it comes to stere- otypes. The young woman is self-conscious as well as self-confident. Yamashita  explains in an interview about Emi that she wanted “to give her a strong voice,  and make her powerful, even bitchy, and proud of it” (Gier and Tejada 1998).  This trait of being unafraid to voice her concerns regarding American identity  politics is pictured when Emi sees a woman wearing chop sticks in her hair to ar- tificially convey the attachment to a certain ethnicity. Emi confronts a white  woman at the Sushi restaurant whether she would believe that wearing two forks  would be ‘unsanitary’ (TRO: 129). With this provocative and ironic example,  multiculturalism is revealed as a social construct that needs to be questioned. To  illustrate that ‘cultural diversity,’ which is the term that she prefers over ‘multi- culturalism,’ should not be color-coded, Emi defines it as including “a white guy  wearing a Nirvana T-shirt and dreads” (TRO: 128).  Similar to Lee’s John Kwang, whose tragic fall stops his political ambitions  and significantly decreases his influence as an interethnic leader with a powerful  minority vernacular, Emi is killed in the end to show that an innovative character  like her, who is defined more by her job and her networking technology than by  her ethnicity, is doomed to fail in Los Angeles, still. Emi was brutally killed in a  drive-by shooting. The respective chapter, entitled ‘Commercial Break – The  Big Sleep,’ foreshadows Emi’s death and alludes to Raymond Chandler’s fa- mous 1930s noir work, which portrays Los Angeles as a corrupt city at the time  of the Great Depression (Clarke 1988: 141). Her last words, “what color is blood  in . . . black and . . . white?” (TRO: 252), relate to the movie and ironically show  that Los Angeles, in some sense, is still stuck in the 1930s.  As illustrated in the introductory quote to this section, Bobby helps to erase  borders in the end when he lets go of the two strings that originated in the or- ange. At first, he was holding on, being in an in-between position and trying to  choose sides. Then, Bobby asks the following questions that are meant to ad- dress the reader and thus are written in a third person narration: “What are these  goddamn lines anyway? What do they connect? What do they divide? What’s he  holding on to?” (TRO: 268). The most culturally diverse characters of all, who,  put in Gómez-Peña’s words, is “jumping borders at ease / jumping borders with  pleasure” (1995: 175), chooses to let go of the lines and thereby paves the way  for a kind of a ‘borderless future’ of ‘the world city’ of Los Angeles and thus  ethnic diversity beyond monocultural or bicultural constraints.         </page> <page sequence="39"> KAREN TEI YAMASHITA’S LOS ANGELES, TROPIC OF ORANGE | 203    8.3 INTERIM CONCLUSION    In Karen Tei Yamashita’s Tropic of Orange (1997), the poetics of narrative,  place, and code-switching are equally important. Set in Los Angeles in the  1990s, the novel displays the changing image of the global(izing) city as well as  the local and global challenges of cultural diversity, migration, and socio- political integration. With the seven ethnically diverse characters, their individu- al narrative voices, and interconnected threats, the novel comes as close as pos- sible to grasping the global. Therefore the imagined global city of Los Angeles  can be regarded as ‘the World City,’ in which different worlds, such as the ‘First  World’ and the ‘Third World,’ come together, cooperate, or collide.  The HyperContexts functions as an overview of the book, alluding to the  global city’s multi-layered textuality, spatiality and form, its history and litera- ture as well as to cultural conflicts. The characters each have one chapter a day  to tell their story, thus creating equality in narrative and socio-political terms.  Similar to the city’s infrastructure, the novel’s structure has no single origin and  no center (Lehan 1998: 257). This approach of fragmentation and convergence  resembles a postmodern representation of urban structure, global narrative, and  ethnic diversity (Raussert 2011: 103). Moreover, the mixing of genres super- sedes the former standards of ethnic American fiction generally, and Asian  American in particular, paving the road for a new narrative leeway in a globaliz- ing age (Rody 2009: 136).  The poetics of code-switching functions as a tool to echo the diversity of the  global city. The novel is told in a ‘polyglot’ fashion (Murashige 2006) with mul- tiple languages, such as English, Spanish, and Japanese, and seven individually  tailored narrative voices with distinct speech patterns and syntax. The novel fo- cuses on the city’s often underrepresented minorities in a formerly predominant  white American L.A., thereby challenging the literary traditions of the city.  Thus, a linguistic, ethnic, and literary ‘zone of contact’ (Bakhtin 1981: 27f.) is  created in the global city of Los Angeles, one in which different languages, cul- tures, and ideologies intersect.  The novel’s portrayal of increased mobility of people, criminals, oranges, in- formation, and other traffic enhances the impression of a growing connectivity  of the world, creating a global consciousness. The characters represent globaliza- tion from different angles, illustrating the different impact and numerous reper- cussions of globalization, including the opportunities and the pitfalls of the phe- nomenon. Arcangel, for example, fights against an anthropomorphized NAFTA,  illustrating the South’s economic dependence on the North.  </page> <page sequence="40"> 204 | DIVERCITY – GLOBAL CITIES AS A LITERARY PHENOMENON    Instead of letting all characters migrate and move, the novel creates the im- age that the whole geography is moved. Everything converges in the imagined  global city of Los Angeles and the neighboring border zone, becoming ‘elastic’  in geographic and socio-political terms. However, the characters also have the  power to change geography when taking their culture with them (Gier and  Tejada 1998), ultimately altering the city of L.A., its appearance, and the cultural  identity of a place.  Lines, a synonym for borders in the physical and metaphorical sense, play a  crucial role in the novel. In the end, the collaboration of the seven diverse char- acters advocates globalization as a process of hybridization and global mélange  when a shifting of borders takes place. Instead of focusing solely on the Asian  American minority, the novel manages to evoke an ‘interethnic alliance’ of the  cultures of the border region and those impacted by borders in a wider, meta- phorical sense. The novel’s notion of ‘cultural diversity’ thus challenges the in- sistence on ‘these lines’ not only in physical-geographic or literary-generic, but  also in ethnic-categorical and socio-political terms.  </page> </plain_text>
