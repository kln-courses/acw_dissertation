<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jan Gonda THE POPULAR PRAJAPATI From a survey of the broad contents of the chapters or paragraphs dealing with the great Vedic god Prajapati in books and articles on ancient Indian religion, it appears that there is almost general agree- ment, with some differences of detail, on two points: this deity is comparatively "young," and essentially a product of ritualistic or theological speculation. According to Oldenberg, Prajapati is younger than Savitar-that is, later than this comparatively "new" figure recognized as a deity or adopted into the pantheon, "a young and vague, broadly defined deity."' Eliot described him as a new figure,2 whose name, meaning "Lord of living creatures,"3 occurs in the Rgveda as an epithet of the sun and occasionally denotes the generator of all gods and worlds.4 Keith was of the opinion that Prajapati, while approaching the position of a creator, is the most prominent example of a new and in some way abstract deity brought into existence by theosophic speculation without claims to be a god of the I H.

In Sukumari Bhattacharji's view, Prajapati is a semiabstract deity, the most important epiphany of Brahman, whose name in post-Rgvedic times "came to indicate a god with control over procreation, a supreme god."8 That Eggeling, Sylvain Levi, and recently G. U. Thite, writing on the sacrifice as described and explained in the Brahmanas, should have focused attention on Prajapati's relations and identification with this most important institution and especially on the remarkable doctrine con- cerning his reconstruction in the shape of the great fireplace, and that authors such as Devasthali and Kramrisch were one-sidedly interested by his role in myths and mythological tales, is perfectly intelligible.9 But this does not alter the fact that certain aspects and functions of this god are constantly left undiscussed.'0 And that is notwithstanding Hillebrandt's note of warning: "Prajapati is by no means as young as s A.

Like Bhaga (the god of love and marriage), Aryaman (the divine best man and family friend), and Pustipati (the lord of welfare), Prajapati is among the deities invoked and worshiped during the wedding ceremonies (MG 1.9.28; 1.10.11, 13; KG 22.2-3; cf. AVS 14.2.13; 19.42.7). The Brautwerber, accepting the girl, gives her in charge to Prajapati (MG 1.8.9), who at a later moment is besought to join her with the bridegroom (1.10.13). When, after the period of chastity, bride and bridegroom lie down together for the first time, the former asks this god to take delight in her body and to give her many children (1.14.16; ApMB 1.11.4, etc.). Whereas the sthalipaka, a mixture of rice or barley cooked in milk, is normally sacred to Agni, a newly married man should, on the morning after his wedding, offer from it to this god; he eats three times from it, and his wife consumes the remainder (MG 1.14.11 ff.; VG 15.21 ff.); from the accompanying mantra it appears that this rite is to promote harmony between husband and wife.13 A similar sacrifice performed on the fourth day after the wedding is to do away with the evil in the wife, which might kill husband, children, and cattle (PG 1.11.3 ff.). Praja- pati is, naturally enough, one of the gods invoked in the impregnation rite described in BGS 2.2.2. In one of the mantras that are to be pronounced by the husband after copulation, a reference occurs to Dhatar (the god "who places," in this case the embryo) and Prajapati, who have ordained that the man shall pour his sperm into the woman (SG 1.19.3 ff.). In connection with the rite for securing the birth of a son (pumsavana), mention is made of a sacrifice to Prajapati (AsvG 1.13.7), or this god is besought to be pleased with the body of the expectant mother (BG 1.9.3). For the same purpose, Agni is asked each first day of a lunar fortnight to destroy the demons who are aiming at the womb and embryo, Death is requested to go away, and Visnu, Tvastar, Prajapati, and Dhatar (all of them concerning them- selves with pregnancy) are invited to fulfill their respective duties (MG 2.18.2). When a girl is in her first rtu (the favorable period after " A. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, 2 vols., 2d ed. (Breslau, 1929), 2:396, n. 1. 12 H. Oldenberg, Vorwissenschaftliche Wissenschaft (Gottingen, 1919), p. 28. 13 For eating together as a widespread marriage ceremony, see M. Winternitz, "Das altindische Hochzeitsritual," Vienna Akademie Denkschrift, vol. 40 (1892). 131</page><page sequence="4">The Popular Prajdpati menstruation), an oblation of boiled rice should be offered to Praja- pati (AsvGPar 8). Although the recitation of the hymn of Vatsapri (TS 4.2.2), which is also used in the solemn ritual of the piling of the great fireplace (agnicayana) to consecrate the touching of a newborn child, is no doubt a foreign element inserted in a popular rite (ApG 6.15.1), the belief that one may effect longevity for the child in imitation of Prajapati (SB 6.7.4.1) by kissing him on the head (cf. HG 2.4.17) and murmuring definite formulae may be regarded as an ancient custom.14 None of the twelve gods-among them Prajapati- to whom butter oblations are offered when the bride is seated behind the fire can be said to be completely unconnected with the purpose of the rite (SG 1.11.4); yet the question arises whether the number of gods has not been made larger in the course of time. From the rules to be observed on the occasion of the reception of a distinguished guest, it appears that this lord of creatures extended his influence even to the father-in-law; whereas the animal offered to an officiating priest should be sacred to Brhaspati, and that offered to a king should be sacred to Indra, the father-in-law is given an animal sacred to Prajapati (SG 2.15.4 ff.). However, this rule must have passed a brahmanical systematist. Some of the above domestic rites may have been modified and/or elaborated by ritualists and systematists; on the whole, however, they create the impression of being ancient and "popular." So does, no doubt, the wish expressed by the wife of the sacrificer in VS 8.1 0-"Prajapati, vigorous male, placer of seed, place seed in me"-and the belief that this god "goes about within the womb" (AVS 10.8.13; AVP 16.102.2). Dealing with the widespread and decidedly popular custom of dedicating the earliest produce of the season to the deity, the author of JG 1.24 mentions a preliminary offering of old fruits to Agni (in whose province are also fertility and procreation), Dhanvantari (the divine physician), Prajapati, and Indra (the deity presiding over this rite).15 Here the name of Prajapati may perhaps be considered to be a later addition; in any case, he is here also expected to fulfill his original and most characteristic function. Since what modern men call an act of repairing was in an archaic or traditional society a form of re-creation, and since Prajapati does not only create life but is also believed to preserve it, he is quite naturally one of the gods invoked in a rite for appeasement of evil (santi, MG 2.1.6) and in prayascitta rites for redress, atonement, 14 See the paragraphs on the ancient Indian birth ritual in J. Gonda, Vedic Ritual (Leiden, 1980), pp. 371 ff. 15 See J. J. Meyer, Trilogie altindischer Machte und Feste der Vegetation, 3 vols. (Zurich and Leipzig, 1937), 3:130, n. 2; 3:287, s.v.

In any case, it is difficult to say when and through the agency of whom-people or elite-Prajapati's name was associated with it. The use of the Prajapati mantra par excellence, the henotheistic invocation found in RV 10.121.10, "O Prajapati, none other than thou encompasses all these creatures; for whatever object of desire we sacrifice to thee, let that be ours; may we be lords of riches"-which, by the way, need not be regarded as bearing the stamp of the ritualistic learning and speculation of the Brahmana period-is, for instance, required on the occasion of the sTmantonnayana (the dividing of the hair of a woman during her first pregnancy; SG 1.22.7), on that of the pumsavana (HG 2.2.2), on that of the first feeding of a child with solid food (HG 2.5.2), and on that of the first cutting of its hair (a transitional rite performed for the sake of longevity;17 HG 2.6.2). In these periods of transition, Prajapati's creative and preservative power should be duly activated for the benefit of the woman or the child.'8 The use of the whole sukta RV 10.121, traditionally ascribed to Hiranyagarbha Prajapatya, is enjoined upon those who perform the anavalobhana ritual, which is to prevent any disturbance of the embryo (AsvGPar 11) and in the name-giving ritual, which was an act of creation (BG 2.1.24).19 Though handed down in ritualistic contexts, some "identifications" or equalizations of Prajapati with animals create the impression of having originated in the "popular" sphere. "The he-goat is no other than Prajapati, for goats are most clearly of this god-whence, bringing forth three times in a year, they produce two or three" (SB 5.2.1.24; cf. 4.5.5.6, also mentioning sheep). The she-goat used for buying the soma (BhS 10.17.4; ApS 10.25.12; MS 2.1.4.11) is ad- dressed with "Thou art ... the nature [varnah] of Prajapati." 16 See, e.g., M. Eliade, Myth and Reality (London, 1964), pp. 21 ff.; J. Gonda, "Prajapati and prayagcitta," in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (forthcoming). Notice also that, in a text to be used (Kaus 40.14) for recovery of virility, that is, AVS 4.4 (AVP 4.5), stanza 2 (3) urges the god, the "bull," to "be up, stirring, with procreative sexual energy" and that the man who builds a house in order to found a family is held to be a replica of the creator god (AVS 9.3.11; AVP 16.40.3). 17 Gonda, Vedic Ritual (n. 14 above), pp. 90-91. On these rites and on the use of the stanza in the domestic rites of the Vaikhanasas, also see J. Gonda, "The Ritual Use of RV 10.121.10," in Rtam (forthcoming). 18 Notice that in HG this mantra is the last of a set of six mantras, the other five being prayers addressed to Varuna and Agni (RV 1.24.1 1, 1.25.19, 4.1.4, 5; TB 2.4.1.9), which do not smack of "scholarly" elaboration. 19 See Gonda, Vedic Ritual, pp. 374 ff. 133</page><page sequence="6">The Popular Prajapati Regarding animals as bearers of power, archaic man was not averse to believing that a god could assume the outward form of a non- human creature characterized by a striking feature of that god's personality.20 The "bulky" bull to whom homage is paid (VS 8.8) is, by both the commentators as well as the author of gB 4.4.1.14, regarded as identical with the lord of creatures.2' With reference to the mythical event that a boar, called Emusa, raised up the earth, the author of SB 14.1.2.11 states that that boar was Prajapati.22 In one of the versions of the theme of the primeval incest, Prajapati is said to have assumed the form of a stag in order to approach his own daughter (either the Sky or Usas, Dawn) in the form of a deer (AiB 3.33; SB 1.7.4.1 ff.; 2.1.2.8 ff.; PB 8.2.10; JB 3.262).23 Whatever the history of this mythical narrative and its component elements (the incest, the transformation, Rudra's piercing the stag, the latter's becoming a constellation, etc.), the possibility of an underlying pre- existent popular belief in Prajapati's ability to assume the corporeal form of some species of the antelope family-which is fairly closely related to sheep, goats, and oxen-should not be entirely ruled out. A similar remark might be made with regard to the story of Prajapati creating living beings after having assumed the form of a tortoise (SB 7.5.1.5), an animal that in the same passage (SB 7.5.1.2) is identified with the tripartite universe (cf. SB 6.3.1.11, where Prajapati is these worlds and the quarters of the universe) and is said to be the essence, 20 See F. Heiler, Erscheinungsformen und Wesen der Religion (Stuttgart, 1961), pp. 83-84. The Greek god Pan, the embodied uncivilized sexual power, has the feet and the horns of a he-goat. Procreating offspring is indeed the most essential trait of Prajapati's character (see, e.g., AV 11.1.11, 15.21.5; TB 1.1.3.5, 1.1.4.3, 1.1.5.4). 21 In Mbh 12.263.9338 C, Prajapati is the bull (vrsabhah).It is difficult to say if-or how far-statements found in post-Vedic literature give a faithful impression of ancient popular belief. When, however, in ViDhPur 3.301.20 and AgniPur 209.44 the seeds and the ripe corn or cooked food are said to belong to Prajapati, and in Mbh 12.301.3 (critical edition; 14.42.26 following Bombay edition) this god is the presiding deity of the organ of generation, there is a good chance that the authors' ancestors in Vedic times were already of the same opinion. 22 See A. A. Macdonell, in Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1895), pp. 178 ff.; F. B. J. Kuiper in Mededelingen letterkunde 13, no. 7 (Amsterdam Academy, 1950), 163 ff. When, however, the poet of the obscure stanza AVS 4.11.7 describes the draft ox as being "Indra [as far as I can judge] from his form, Agni from his bearing [shoulder], Prajapati, Paramesthin, Viraj," we are dealing with a piece of primitive reflection and speculation. 23 See Eggeling (n. 9 above), 1:209, 284; W. Caland, Pancavimsa-Brahmana trans- lated (Calcutta, 1931), pp. 166-67; E. Arbman, Rudra (Uppsala, 1922), pp. 30 ff.; and Kramrisch (n. 9 above). For Prajapati begetting Agni by RohinT, see TB 1.1.2.2, 1.1.3.11, 1.1.5.7, 1.1.8.2. It is difficult to know if-or how far-the stories concerning Prajapati's semen (AiB 3.33.6, 3.34; JB 3.263) are elaborations of an originally "popular" theme. 134</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions or lifesap (rasa), of these worlds (SB 6.3.1.1) and the vital breath that "makes all these creatures" (SB 6.3.1.7).24 According to KapS 48.17, the anthill belongs to Prajapati, and Kaus 21.23 mentions his name in connection with a magic rite per- formed over such a mound, which is, in TS 5.1.3.5, said to be the ear of the earth, which is identical with Prajapati.25 The fact that cows, in the Rgveda, are already a concern of Prajapati's stamps him as a god who sets his heart on meeting the first biological and economic demands of his worshipers. In the fourth and last stanza of the blessing of cattle (RV 10.169), the poet says that this god has given him cows and has led them to the abode for his herd (cf. AsvG 2.10.6); he expresses the hope that he may live himself together with their offspring. In view of the great importance of Vedic man's livestock and the innumerable prayers in his literature for offspring and cattle (the alliterative prajah pasun, e.g., TS 2.1.1.4), the many references to the relations of the lord of creatures with bovine animals which he is said to have created at the same time as human beings (cf. also PB 23.9.2)-and his everlasting care of them are indeed not surprising. He is not only the father of the cows (JB 2.90), emitting (producing) them (TS 1.5.9.7) or fashioning them out of his semen (PB 8.2.10); PB 18.6.26 also makes mention of a body-that is, the embodiment or manifestation of Prajapati in cattle.26 That Prajapati was supposed to have relations with cattle is also apparent from the tradition handed down in KS 10.11:138.7 ff., MS 2.2.4:18.1 ff., and TS 2.4.4.2-3:27 when he had emitted (created) cattle, they went away from him; he made Pfisan their guardian. This god followed the animals and fetched the garmut (a kind of wild bean) that had sprung up on the place where they stayed. At their request, Prajapati consented to offer this to Piusan and Soma. Now beans are widely believed to produce sexual desire and stimulate the powers of fecundity, and they are offered to deities presiding over the 24 For the tortoise in general, see Meyer (n. 15 above), 3:318, s.v. "Schildkr6te"; as an "Urtier," 3:233; as the "Urseele" of the universe, 3:225-26. 25 On anthills, see, e.g., E. Dammann, Die Religionen Afrikas (Stuttgart, 1963), pp. 74, 180-81; J. G. Frazer, The Golden Bough, abr. ed. (London, 1957), p. 651: "In Morocco lethargia patients are given ants to swallow"; Gonda, Vedic Ritual (n. 14 above), pp. 102 ff. 26 Those passages in which he is related to have created cattle by ritual means (e.g., TS 2.4.11.4) must for the moment be left out of consideration. 27 Cf. also the parallel version in which Brhaspati (not Pusan and Soma) plays a part: KS 10.11:137.23 ff.; MS 2.2.4:17.15 ff.; TS 2.4.4.1 (where offspring, not cattle, are created). See the translation and notes by W.

In view of the widespread and no doubt ancient belief in the aphrodisiac property of beans, their relation with Praja- pati can probably be assigned to a date earlier than these ritual texts, in which the god has-to all appearances secondarily-been made the central figure of mythical narratives.29 The baliharana, the daily presentation of gifts, especially food, as propitiating oblations to a variety of beings (divine, semidivine, and others), is no doubt an ancient and popular custom. As described in GG 1.4 and KhG 1.5.20 ff. (the procedure is not always the same), it consists of an oblation to Prajapati and one to Agni Svistakrt (by which the sacrifice becomes well performed); the offering of balls at four places for the Earth, Vayu, the Visve Devah, and again Prajapati; the sprinkling of water; and some other balls. The rite is performed by husband and wife and without mantras.30 Passages such as AVS 3.15.6, though invoking Prajapati together with some other gods-in this case Indra, Savitar, Soma, and Agni- should not be regarded as products of theological speculation or scholarly combination of divine figures. A man who is desirous of success in trade-and trade involves traveling and the possibility of loss or accidents-invokes Indra, the "trader," as his guide and protector (he calls this god his puraetar, AVS 3.15.1); offers to Agni in hopes of gain and successful bargaining (AVS 3.15.3, 4, 5, 8); appeals to Savitar, the stimulator, because this god dispels all fear and difficulties (RV 5.82.4-5) and allots wealth and treasures to his worshipers (3.56.6; 4.54.1); offers to Soma, who-likewise often appearing in domestic rites-can afford protection from enemies (10.25.7) and is constantly described as bestowing wealth (9.45.3; 9.52.1); and offers to Prajapati, no doubt because he is the preserver of life.31 Prajapati appears in the same function in AVS 8.1.17 (AVP 16.2.10) stating that Heaven and Earth (the universal parents), as well 28 I refer to Meyer, 1:119 ff., and 3:292; Gonda, Vedic Ritual (n. 14 above), pp. 120-21. 29 For ritualistic mythology, identification, application, and explanation based on Prajapati's relations with cattle, see, e.g., PB 7.10.13 ff. 30 In the more elaborate description of the baliharana in MG 2.12, KG 54. 1, JG 1.23, and BhG 3.12, Prajapati is one of the many gods to whom the offerings are given. There is a translation of the above Khadira passage in E. Washburn Hopkins's contribution to The Cambridge History of India (Cambridge, 1922, 1951), 1:229-30. 31 The largely identical stanza AVP 19.49.3 reads-possibly under priestly influence -"Brhaspati" instead of "Prajapati" (likewise, HG 1.15.1). 136</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions as Prajapati and the herbs with their king Soma, have taken away a man from death. At this point it seems necessary to turn for a moment to the significance and implications of the god's name. Leaving those names of deities that are etymologically obscure or disputed (e.g., Indra, Varuna) and special cases out of consideration, we see that some Vedic gods bear the name of the phenomenon or concept they stand for (Agni, "fire"; Usas, "dawn"; Aditi, "freedom"; Anumati, "assent" -i.e., the common noun is also a proper name); others are called by a name that clearly indicates their function (Dhatar, "the one who places, the Establisher"; Savitar, "the Impeller, Stimulator"); and others again are called by words expressing a certain relation with an idea denoted by a common noun (AranyanT, "a female deity or genius belonging to, being in, or concerned with the aranyam, wilderness"; cf. indrdnT, "the deity who belongs to Indra, Mrs. Indra").32 To the last group belong the very numerous combinations or compounds with pati, "lord, master, ruler, owner, possessor." We would do well to remember that this "analytical" translation does not mean that a pati is either a lord or a possessor; he is an owner, ruler, and dispenser at the same time. Prajapati, who "abounds in generative energy" (prajananavant, AVS 19.17.9; 19.18.9; AVP 7.16.9; 7.17.9), is in every respect characterized by procreative power. Notwithstanding the remarkable absence of etymologically identical names in the other Indo-European languages, or even in the ancient Iranian languages,33 we are, in my opinion, safe in supposing this type of name to have been in use before the age of the Rgveda. And that is not only because of the frequency, variety, and popularity of pati names in the oldest Vedic texts, but also because similar names, often denoting otherwise anonymous "owner" gods ("Lord of a definite sphere or of a definite being or thing," "Possessor spirits, lords and mistresses [female rulers] of nature"), are an essential element in many reli- gions.34 I can neither subscribe to the opinion that all the Vedic names of this type, with the exception of Prajapati, Ksetrasya pati, 32 See J.

It would rather appear to me that the frequent occurrence of names of this type must be attributed, on the one hand, to the well-known tendency of conceiving manifestations of power as persons or spiritual beings and of representing their nature, functions, actions, and reac- tions as analogous to those of human masters, lords, or authorities (in AVS 3.10.9 the lords of the seasons are distinguished from the seasons), and, on the other hand, to the necessity of giving names to the innumerable, often highly indefinite power concepts or rather manifestations of power (inclusive of functions of gods called by proper names) that empirically and within some form of experience become authenticated in things, persons, and phenomena and by virtue of which these are influential and effective.36 Cases are not rare in which the same pati name is used in reference to a human being and a "deity"; in RV 8.17.14, the vocative vaCstos pate addresses the patron of the sacrifice; in 1.27.12, 1.37.8, 7.55.5, and others, a vispati, and in AVS 3.4.1, a vis'am patih, is a human headman, chief of a body of persons belonging to the third estate; in RV 2.1.2 and 6.53.2 a grhapati is a human householder (whether or not functioning in a rite that is being performed). The derivative ksaitrapatyam "landed property" is used in 1.112.13 in connection with a patron or ancestor; when a priest is elected to the function of a brahman he is addressed as lord of the earth (bh7upate), etc. (TB 3.7.6.1; ApS 3.18.2).37 35 Schmidt (n. 33 above).With regard to r6Tvta Orlp6iv, "ApTeptg (Homer Iliad 21.470 is the only occurrence), W. Burkert (Griechische Religion [Stuttgart, 1977], p. 234; also see p. 81) observes: "'Herrin der Tiere' heiszt Artemis ... mit offenbar vorgepragter Formel, und hierin sieht man mit Recht einen Schliissel zu ihrem Wesen. Diese P6tnia ther6n ist eine Herrin der gesamten wilden Natur, der Fische des Wassers, der Vogel der Luft, der Lowen und Hirsche, Ziegen und Hasen; sie selbst ist wild und unheimlich. Sie hegt und schitzt die Jungtiere, .. . aber zugleich ist sie die Jagerin ... Die Vorstellung von einer Herrin der Tiere uberhaupt geht ohne Zweifel bis ins Palaolithicum zurick." See also E. Spartz, "Das Wappenbild des Herrn und der Herrin der Tiere" (Ph.D. diss., University of Munich, 1964); for other modern literature, see Burkert, p. 81; E. Hofstetter, Der Herr der Tiere im alten Indien (Wiesbaden, 1980), pp. I ff. 36 See G. van der Leeuw, Religion in Essence and Manifestation (London, 1938), p. 28. 37 Cf. also an expression such as "may we be lords of wealth (patayo rayTmdm)" (AVg 6.62.2), which seems to be stereotyped, with "the lords of rain (varsasya patayah)" (9.7.14), who, of course, are not human beings. Frequently, scholars have translated the name Prajapati, no doubt also to remind their readers of his main functions and their significance in a given context. For the sake of clearness, an occasional translation may indeed be required, but it should be borne in mind that 138</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions It is, moreover, highly improbable that, with the exception of four names, all pati names were "Augenblicksbildungen." The rarity of some of them may be caused by chance, a certain disinterestedness of other or later authors, or the one-sidedness or incompleteness of the textual tradition (remember the Greek 7Tn6vta rlpcov). However, some poet, on the analogy of existing expressions, may have formed a new combination that was not received by his hearers and successors. On the other hand, many names are so well in harmony with or illustrated by descriptions of or references to the nature and function of their bearers and, in addition, used in more than one context that it is hardly conceivable that they were nothing but ephemeral neolo- gisms. When, in RV 10.166, a text traditionally and rightly known as destructive of rivals, Vacas pati is invoked to surpass and defeat the opponents of the speaker (stanza 4), who (in stanza 1) has expressed the wish to become the conqueror of his rivals, the killer of his enemies, and so forth, the idea evoked by the name Lord of Speech is perfectly clear; it denotes that power that resides in a man's words and governs his speech so as to enable him to speak authoritatively and to be a skillful debater offering invincible opposition. In AVS 1.1.1 ff., Vacas pati is requested to make the person speaking re- member his lessons in sacred learning; that is, this deity is here held responsible for the absorption of the teaching.38 In VS 4.4, TS 1.2. 1k, and so on, Vakpati and Citpati ("the Lord of Thought") are besought to purify the sacrificer who is about to perform a soma ceremony; the powers supervising word and thought should purify his speech and thinking. The "genius" addressed as manasas pati in RV 10.164.1 is instructed by the person speaking to go far away and to take a message to Nirrti, the goddess of decay; the introduction of this figure enables the speaker to monologize and exhort himself to bring something to the notice of Nirrti. However, in AVP 19.36.4, the same genius is requested to go away and is asked why he utters things that should remain unuttered-"I do not desire you, go away, frequent trees [and] woods"; this speaker addresses the accuser of his guilty conscience. In RV 5.42.14, mention is made of the thundering and roaring lord of the refreshing draught or liquid (ilas pati); the deity meant must be Parjanya, the god of rain, who in 6.52.16 is described as producing this liquid. the difference between Prajapati, "the Creator," and, e.g., Artemis, "mistress of the animals," is obvious; in the former case the literal meaning of the name remained perfectly intelligible. 38 Similar observations could be made, e.g., with regard to ksetrasya pati, which is not taken to be an "Augenblicksbildung" (see above). The functions of an owner of the field and what is expected from him are described in RV 4.57 in detail. He is not only responsible for the field or soil but also for its yield of milk and honey. 139</page><page sequence="12">The Popular Prajapati Not infrequently, a pati name is used as an epithet of a deity who, whether in the same sentence or not, is called by a proper name: in RV 6.53.1, "O Lord of the way ..., O Pusan" (pathas pate ... pusan) is used, no doubt to emphasize this function of the god who is said to be "employed" to convey, like a vehicle, those speaking to a liberal patron. In 9.31.6, Soma is addressed by the vocatives indo, "O bright drop," and bhuvanasya pate, "O Lord of the [inhabited] world."39 In 9.113.2, the same god is addressed as "Lord of the regions" (disam pate) and by his own name, but in 9.28.1 the god's name is "replaced" by manasas patih (see above), which characterizes the divine draught as the power governing the psychical organ in which the processes of thought, will, and feeling take place and from which emerges the poet's vision or inspiration of which Soma is also said to be the pati (9.75.2; 9.99.6).40 Like the above vacas pati, which in 9.101.5 likewise refers to Soma, this manasas pati attests to the poet's freedom to apply the same pati epithet to more than one god, or, should we say, to identify temporarily a pati with different deities. In AVS 7.21.1, the sun is referred to as "lord of the sky," not by one of his well-known names. These epithets are often used as appositions; for example, in RV 9.11.8 and AVS 6.36.1, (Agni) Vaisvanara, in a prayer for heat, is invoked also as "lord of light." Then also, they can put us on the track of a function of a god that is not indicated by his name or known to be his main business. In AVS 10.5.45, a prayer for food invoking Prajapati, to whom the food that is on the earth is said to belong,4' twice calls him "lord of the earth." It should not, however, be taken for granted that words such as Prajapati, Vakpati, and so forth, were epithets or descriptive appositions before they came into use as names.42 That this would be an improbable supposi- tion is also apparent from their frequent predicative use in descriptive passages. In RV 6.58.4, Pfusan is not only characterized as "active for the advantage of man" (maghavan) and an "energetic accomplisher of wonderful deeds" (dasmavarcas), but also as ilas patih (see above; cf. 4.3.7); in 5.51.12, Soma is said to be bhuvanasya patih, and the poet of 9.86.5 states that he "rules as a lord the whole inhabited world" (cf. also 10.128.7; AVS 5.3.9; other instances are to be found at RV 1.44.9). 39 Cf. the many Rgvedic texts collected in J.

Macdonell, Vedic Mythology (Strasbourg, 1897), pp. 118-19; Konow (n. 6 above), pp. 31-32. 140</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions There can be no doubt that a considerable part of these expressions and statements is a product of poetic (and mythopoeic) imagination rather than scholarly reflection. That is not to say, however, that at least some pati combinations were not at the same time in use as proper names or were not going to assume that character.43 Remem- ber cases such as AVS 13.4.47: "thou art sacyah patih, 0 Indra" (in later times this god is SacTpati). And notice that pati combinations also occur beside regular proper names of deities. In RV 7.35.10, the god Savitar, the Dawns (plural), Parjanya, and Ksetrasya pati are besought to be auspicious; the poet of 5.41.8 eulogizes Vastospati and Tvastar, bringers of prosperity; in AVS 5.3.9, the poet implores the protection of Dhatar, Vidhatar, the lord of the (inhabited) world (bhuvanasya yas patih), the god Savitar, the Adityas, and so forth (in RV 10.128.7 it reads "dhata dhatrnam bhuvanasya yas patir devam trataram ..."); the author of 19.11.1 invokes the lords of reality (or of truth, satyasya), the coursers, the kine, the Rbhus, and the Fathers; in 19.20.2 there is mention of Bhuvanasya pati, Prajapati, and Matarisvan. In any case, these facts do not seem to refute the above argument with regard to the age and the original use of the name Prajapati. Not infrequently, Prajapati is described as cooperating with one other god, as receiving an offering together with him, and so on. In several cases this other god is Vayu, the divine representative of the moving air, the support and encloser of all beings (SB 8.4.1.26). In AVS 2.34.4-which belongs to a text intended to accompany the sacrifice of an animal (cf. Kaus 44.7, 15)-AVP 3.32.6, TS 3.1.4-5, and TA 3.11.29, 32, Vayu and Prajapati are requested to release the cattle of the village or of the forest (probably the comrades of the sacrificial victim);44 Vayu should do this "[at] first" (he is an "intro- ductory" deity) and then Prajapati, making his creatures (who have in fact to perform the task) his partners.45 One of the elements of the no doubt old and essentially popular Mahavrata festival is the swinging 43 It may parenthetically be observed that not all pati combinations were fixed as to their form: RV 1.52.13, prthivya ... brhatdh pdtir bhuh; 1.89.5, jdgatas tasthtsas pdtim (cf. 1.101.5); 5.63.3, divas patir prthivyah; 8.13.8, aya dhiya' yd ucyite patir divdh ("[Indra] who is called by [in] this 'poem' the lord [or Lord] of the heavens"). 44 As to Vayu and the animals, see below. It is true that in the (probably younger) parallel stanzas AVP 3.32.4-5, Agni or Indra are invoked together with Prajapati; Agni is also mentioned in AVS stanza 3; the name of Indra is not out of harmony with the situation. 45 See Gonda, Dual Deities (n. 34 above), pp. 209 ff., 219; and The Praigasastra (Amsterdam, 1981), p. 5. For this somewhat free translation of prajdyd samrardndh, see K. F. Geldner, Der Rig-Veda uibersetzt (Cambridge, Mass., 1951) 3:146 (on RV 10.15.8); AVP 3.32.6 reads samvidanah ("in harmony with"). 141</page><page sequence="14">The Popular Prajdpati of the hotar;46 according to SS 17.16.7, this is accompanied by the mantra "Prajapati must mount you; Vayu [in whose province this process takes place] must swing you." Enumerating a number of gods who received one single-and different-victim each, VS 24.30 and MS 3.14.11:174.7 begin the list with Prajapati and Vayu, who are given one gayal in common (compare the commentary). In the ritual described in S? 9.23.6-7, a victim is immolated for Prajapati, but the cake that belongs to it is destined for Vayu; or the victim is sacred to the latter and the cake belongs to the former. With reference to the former case, it is observed in KB 19.2 (19.1.9 ff.) that Vayu is clearly Prajapati's rapam, that is, his symbol or manifestation, a view of the situation based on the belief that Prajapati is the greater god. (For the offering of a sacrificial cake [pasupuro.das] to Prajapati before the immolation of a victim to Vayu at the agnicayana, see also TS 5.5.1.3-4, ApS 16.8.6-7, and ?B 6.2.2.11, "as to why the victim belongs to Vayu and the cake to Prajapati, one-half of Prajapati doubtless is Vayu, and one-half is Prajapati," etc.) From the dilemma in which the persons in TS 5.5.1.3 are put (namely, Should an animal be sacrificed to Vayu, or to Prajapati?) it appears that, in the circum- stances described, both deities are considered to be of equal rank and may claim the same rights. The author of SB 2.5.1.5 argues that Prajapati emitted (created) the living beings in the same way as the quarters of the universe are entered by the blowing wind. According to AVPar 71.17.5, a portent that occurs on images of these two gods or on that of Vigvakarman relates to the king's subjects. Since, in the other cases mentioned, the relation between the object affected and the effect of the portent is, on the whole, clear, these gods no doubt figure here because of their creative and supporting functions (as to Vayu, see, e.g., RV 7.92.3; SB 8.4.1.26, 14.2.1.9; as to Visvakarman, who is identified with Vayu, see SB 8.1.1.7, 8.6.1.17; RV 10.82.3; SB 9.2.3.42).47 Now, if it is warranted to draw conclusions from the facts brought to light with regard to the ancient Iranian divine representative of the moving air combined with data and inferences drawn from the ancient Vedic literature, Vayu was in prehistoric times a more impor- tant divine personality than the later Indian texts would have us believe.48 He was not only an "introductory god" considered to occupy the first place, but, for instance, in the Atharvaveda Samhita, 46 See J. Gonda, "Ursprung und Wesen des indischen Dramas," in Acta Orientalia (Leyden) 19 (1943), 348-49, 388-89. 47 Also see, e.g., SB 6.2.1.39 ff., 8.3.4.11 and 15, 8.4.1.6; GG 1.4 (see above). 48 I refer to Gonda, Dual Deities (n. 34 above), chap. 6; J. Filliozat, La Doctrine classique de la medecine indienne (Paris, 1949), pp. 51 ff. 142</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions he was credited with some qualities that as a rule are characteristic of a high deity:49 he is said to be a creator (SB 8.6.1.17; see above) who "generates all this [the universe]" (10.3.5.1); he is omnipresent (MS 2.2.7:20.19-20; SB 8.2.3.2); also, he was the god of the forest and domestic animals and the protector of trees (VS 14.30; TS 4.3.10.2; TB 3.2.1.3; MS 3.9.4:120.9). He is identical with breath or vital air (prana, SB 4.4.1.15), which sustains everything living (SB 8.2.2.8; cf. 8.3.2.4). But elsewhere (6.3.1.9) Prajapati is said to be prana (cf. also, 7.4.1.16; 8.1.1.13); according to the author of SB 11.1.6.17, Prajapati is the prdna that blows here. Like Prajapati, Vayu is undefined (anirukta, 8.7.3.12); that is to say, he belongs to the sphere beyond the well-known and definite forms, to "a hidden zone where things and forms take on an inorganic aspect."50 Notice also that, in Ram 7.35.61, Vayu is declared to be the breaths and also the whole world (jagat), and in 1.32.1 he is characterized as sarvitmaka, "the self of all"; also, Prajapati is, in SB 1.3.5.10 and 13.6.1.6, identified with sarvam. In AiB 4.26.11, both gods are briefly identified; the author, taking pavamdna to be a name of the purifying wind, not of Soma, quotes RV 9.5.9 (pavamdnah prajipatih, "Pavamana is Praja- pati"51) in substantiation (see also SB 6.1.2.19, "that Prajapati ... is that very Vayu"). Notice also that, in TS 5.6.4.2 and 7.1.5.1, Prajapati is described as floating on the primeval waters after having become wind (vdyur bhuitvd); in MNU 391 he is wind and breath. On the strength of these facts, as well as many others, the hy- pothesis might perhaps suggest itself that Prajapati, who in the course of the Vedic period was unmistakably increasing in importance, at a comparatively early moment extended his interests, influence, and activities to a wider circle than his original province (when he may be supposed to have been only or mainly a lord of offspring or crea- tures), assuming control of phenomena that so far had more exclu- sively belonged to the field of action and influence of Vayu, with whom he had some common interests. Generally speaking, a deity or divine being that to a certain extent appears in functions and situa- tions that are hitherto characteristic of another deity is not infre- quently seen to play a part beside, or together with, the other god (compare the above texts). While the latter sometimes even assumes the name of the former, the "younger colleague" is apt, once the process of assimilation and delegation has started, to continue ex- tending his influence and activities so as to stand eventually for a 49 Also see Gonda, The Prauigasastra (n. 45 above), pp. 4 ff., and Dual Deities (n. 34 above), p. 227. 50 Renou (n. 4 above), p. 76. 51 See L.

As already observed by Meyer, similar relations seem to have existed between the "older" Varuna, whose authority and popularity were in the course of the Vedic period on the wane, and Prajapati.53 The horse is already in RV 1.163.4 (TS 4.6.7.2 and VS 29.15) said to appear like Varuna, and is elsewhere regarded as his animal or identified with him (MS 2.3.3:29.19, "the horse is Varuna and has Varuna as deity"; SB 5.3.1.5, "the horse is Varuna's own"; TS 2.3.12.1). The horse is also said to have been born in the waters, Varuna's element (RV 1.163.1; TS 2.3.12.2, 4.2.10c, 5.7.25; SB 5.1.4.5). Elsewhere, however, Prajapati is, so to say, the horse (KS 24.8:99.11; cf. TS 7.1.20c; SB 7.3.2.10), or this animal belongs to him or is sacred to him (SB 6.5.3.9, 13.1.2.3-5). When the sacrificial horse, having returned from his wanderings, is given the remains of an oblation of grain (BS 15.24-25; ApS 20.15.7 ff.; KS 20.5.18), he is addressed as Prajapati (VS 23.8). According to the author of SB 13.2.6.8, the officiant thereby supplies the king's people abundantly with the possibility of eating food. Here also both gods are addressed in the same context. In one of the formulae used on the occasion of the horse sacrifice, homage is successively paid to the king, Varuna; the horse, Prajapati; and the overlord (TS 7.4.16; KS 5.4.5). Accord- ing to the brahmana explanation given in TB 3.9.16.1-2, the horse is consecrated to Varuna; so the adhvaryu by uttering these words unites this animal with his own deity. By paying homage to Prajapati, however, he does likewise, because the victim is also sacred to Prajapati. (The overlord is said to be Dharma, the horse is addressed as an overlord, and the wish is expressed that the sacrificer may be an overlord of creatures [prajdndm].) Does this passage point to the above process of supersession? If so, when has this process started? And is the piece of information explaining the name of the asva (horse) sdman in PB 11.3.4-5-that is, "Prajapati created the crea- tures after having become a horse"-a product of the author's imagi- nation or the reflection of an ancient popular tradition? 52 One may compare the occurrence of similar developments in the case of syncretism of figures belonging to different religions. See, e.g., the recent article by H. Biezais, "Religion des Volkes und Religion des Gelehrten," in Der Wissenschaftler und das Irrationale, ed. H. P. Duerr, 2 vols. (Frankfurt am Main, 1981), 1:565 ff. 53 Meyer (n. 15 above), esp. 3:315, s.v. "Prajapati," although it is not always wholly convincing. 144</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions Attention may also be called to the vajapeya (literally, "drink offering [for winning] (re-)creative power"), which, historically speak- ing, in all probability owes its origin to a combination of some archaic and popular rites and other elements, upon which an undeni- able formalism came to be imposed when in the course of time it was elaborated and included in the Soma ritual. Among the elements that interest us here are: the frequent occurrence of Prajapati's number, seventeen (e.g., there are seventeen dTksa days, seventeen offerings of Soma for Prajapati [TB 1.3.3.2], who also receives seventeen he-goats [cf. SB 5.1.3.9 ff.; ApS 18.2.13]); the wife of the sacrificer having to wrap around herself a cloth or skirt made of kusa grass, which is strongly reminiscent of similar skirts of grass, leaves, etc., worn in the fertility rites of other peoples, and in any case is a popular custom; the sacrificer having to touch the wheat that is the top piece of the sacrificial post that he ascends (SB 5.2.1.13, "wheat is food, and he who performs the vajapeya wins food"; cf. JB 2.192; SS 15.1.3.11, "it is performed for one desirous of food"); those present throwing seventeen bags of salt-often used in popular rites and widely believed to be a bearer of some particular power-up to him ("for salt means cattle, and cattle is food," SB 15.1.3.16-17) (according to ApS 18.5.16, one may also use bags filled with ashes).54 During a race, in which the sacrificer is to be victorious, seventeen drums are beaten (SB 5.1.5.6)-a typically "primitive" apotropaic rite-and a cup of honey-chthonic, aphrodisiac, and fertilizing-not used for any offer- ing, is placed in the hand of a ksatriya or vaisya competitor.55 I cannot agree with Keith in considering the "essential priestly charac- ter" of the Vajapeya as it stands to be shown, not only by the prominence of Brhaspati-which, by the way, is much less conspicu- ous-but also (and mainly) by the part played by Prajapati (cf. also SS 15.2.3 ff., "the vajapeya is [equal to] Prajapati"; PB 18.6-7).56 There is, of course, no doubt that the figure of Prajapati was also subjected to the process of gradual development and priestly elabora- tion, reinterpretation, and systematization. But in view of the many popular elements of the rite under discussion, some of which are clearly to promote fertility, and so on, this god is, in my opinion, likely to have played a part in this "sacrifice"-or at least in its 54 See also ibid., 3:184 n., who regards the vajapeya as "ursprunglich, nach alien Anzeichen, ein Fruchtsbarkeits- und Erntefest," 3:288, s.v.

Should we perhaps say that the very statement of the aim of this rite in SB 5.1.1.8 and 5.1.3.7-"he who performs the Vajapeya wins Prajapati"-is a refor- mulation of an older "this rite is performed to gain vdja, a [re]genera- tive power which manifests itself in vegetation, cattle, etc., and by which new food and new life is obtained" (cf. also SB 5.1.3.4, 5.1.4.12, "vdjapeya is synonymous with annapeya"; 8.1.1.9, "vaja means food [annam]"), which was believed to be presided over by Prajapati, who, according to 5.1.3.7, is food, and according to 5.1.3.12, means production (prajananam)? If so, the statement found in PB 18.7.1, that is, Prajapati instituted the vdjapeya because he was desirous of vdja, may be supposed to reach back to a comparatively early period. Notice that already in AVS 11.7.3 the words vdjah prajdpatih are coupled and in this context figure as the opposite of mrtyuh, "death." Also notice that, in SB 5.1.1.2, Prajapati -as the sacrifice, it is true-gave himself to the gods as their food and that he is the vdjapeya that is being performed (5.1.4.1). It should, however, be noticed that, in the far from "popular" standard form of the Soma sacrifice-the existence of which is presupposed by the Brahmana literature-Prajapati plays only an insignificant part. The brevity and stereotyped character of the oft-repeated statement that "Prajapati created creatures" (prajdpatih prajd asrjata-e.g., TS 2.1.2.1, 2.4.4.1, 5.1.8.3, 6.6.5.1; PB 6.3.9, 7.10.15, 9.6.7, 10.2.1, 15.8.2, 16.5.23, 24.1.2, 24.11.2) leaves, in the cases mentioned, the reader in the dark about any detail as to how the process of creation had come to pass. One might be tempted to venture the hypothesis that in- stances of this type reflect a comparatively early view of Prajapati's creative activity; the god, bringing time and again biological creation into existence, simply performed the function that is proper to and characteristic of him, the how, the why, and the whereabouts of which are beyond our ken. As is well known, the function assigned to a god-especially a Sondergott57-is often more important than his personality or the god himself. One could also say that, given the reality in the phenomenal world of creative processes that are under- stood as necessary and known to be extant to this day, the existence of a cause, performer, or active power is almost automatically pre- supposed, and this principle, conceived of as a person, an originator, is called Prajapati. That this person is often described as being desirous of propagating himself (e.g., AiB 4.23.1; KB 6.1.1; TS 5.5.2.5; TB 2.1.2.8, 2.2.1.1; PB 6.1.1) may be ascribed to the popular tendency to anthropomorphism and to attributing will and desire to 57 H. Usener, Gotternamen: Versuch einer Lehre von der religiosen Begriffsbildung, 2d ed. (Bonn, 1929). 146</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions divine persons. Longer and more complicated formulations of this wish (e.g., SB 2.4.4.1, "May I abound in progeny and cattle, be glorious and prosperous, be an eater of food") are, in my opinion, hardly ever "primitive" or "popular." In many other cases, however, an author gives us an account of details. For instance, Prajapati is described as being motivated, as desirous of offspring or propagation (TS 3.1.1.1; KB 6.1; PB 6.5.1, 7.5.1). When the reference to this state of mind is followed by particulars-for example, "he was sad and unhappy" (PB 7.5.1), or "he was sorrowful and out of his head the sun came into existence" (6.5.1), or "he developed this world from his expiration" (PB 6.10 [6.4.2]), or "the domestic animals, as soon as he had created them left him" (PB 7.10.13, 17.10.2)-the conclusion seems inevitable that the author or his predecessors had reflected upon the problems or con- sequences of creation, the difficulties in which a creator might be involved, and so on. When the god is said to have created after having subjected himself to austerities (tapas taptva; TS 3.1.1.1; KB 6.1); to have needed the layer of sacrificial grass (barhis) for the execution of his task, that is, the creation of offspring (TS 1.7.4.1); to have, in order to realize that ambition, beheld a sacrificial rite or definite formulae by means of which he succeeded in creating crea- tures (PB 6.1.1; TS 7.2.5.1); to have utilized a sacrifice that is tacitly understood to have already existed (KB 5.3.1; PB 22.9.2); or to have been forced to use ritual elements (e.g., samans, PB 21.2.1) in order to conciliate the creatures he had created, the elaborative influence of ritualistic theory and speculation is perfectly evident. The same conclusion is obvious when Prajapati's creative activities are described as carrying with them further and at first sight unexpected con- sequences, for instance, when Death, devouring the creatures and causing them to procreate, is said to follow Prajapati in making use of definite samans (PB 21.2. 1).58 Summarizing the above observations and arguments, I feel that there are sufficient data pointing to the existence of Prajapati in a comparatively early period of Indian history as a "popular" deity, worshiped by the common man, believed to meet his wishes, and mainly functioning in accordance with the literal meaning of his name. There are also good reasons for supposing that the unsophis- ticated continued to recognize and worship him in this way; at the same time, poets and ritualists, prompted by the inclination to associate elements of the religious tradition of the Aryans in general with elements of sacrificial lore and practice, had begun to credit him 58 Cf., e.g., M.

See, e.g., H. Ringgren, Israelitische Religion (Stuttgart, 1963), pp. 58 ff.; W. Montgomery Watt, Der Islam, 2 vols. (Stuttgart, 1980), 1:44.

On the development of a god's character, the expansion of his original function(s), and the determination of his "career," later tasks, and importance according to the original and fundamental conception of his nature, as well as the simultaneous existence of different features in his character that have arisen succes- sively, also see S.
