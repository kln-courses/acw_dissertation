<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS Volume XV, No. 1, Spring 1987 An Externalist Account of Psychological Content AKEEL BILGRAMI Columbia University I Every since Aristotle invented the practical syllogism it has been as- sumed that intentional states such as beliefs and desires get their point and rationale from the role they play in the common-sense psychological ex- planation of human behavior. This is not one of their features which can be repealed. Russell called such states propositional attitudes and gave a name to what was also assumed long before him, viz., that such states were special in another respect: they possessed content which was specifiable in a that- clause. Finally, it has been an equally longstanding assumption that what made it possible for these intentional states to have a role in the explanation of behavior was the very fact of their possessing content so specifiable. I shall call this last assumption the assumption of their unity or integrity; and in this paper, I should like to probe the philosophical right (over and above this ancient authority) by which we may help ourselves to this assumption. In recent years various examples have been cited and arguments forged upon their basis with a view to putting this assumption at hazard. Content, as given by that-clauses, it is said, cannot be what affects explanation since such content contains too much that is foreign to playing that role. In particular, it harbors elements external to individual agents, which impair these states which possess it for their explanatory tasks - the object of such explanations being the behavior of individuals. Thus, it is argued that we must repudiate the longstanding assumption of the unity of inten- 191</page><page sequence="2">tional states and instead bifurcate them, whereby explanatory tasks are now carried out by a quite separate notion of content than that capturable in that-clauses; a notion of content, fumigated of the outlying elements which contaminate that-clauses.1 The examples I have in mind are, by now, very well known in the philosophical literature and the clamor for bifurcation that comes from exploiting them is widely heard today. Yet many different voices and arguments can be discerned in the clamor. I shall restrict my concern to just one of them. I have already stated it. It is the argument that if intentional states are to play a role in common-sense psychological explanation (ex- planation of action by giving reasons, i.e., by citing beliefs and desires), then contents specified in that-clauses will not be the property in virtue of which they play that role, and a second notion of content will have to be introduced for the purpose. There are other arguments in favor of bifur- cation which, in this paper, I will put aside. For instance, there are many who argue that there is a strong metaphysical intuition that intentional states supervene on the inner physical states of agents who have them and since intentional states individuated by that-clauses depend upon elements external to agents, they fail to respect the intuition and must be supple- mented by a second notion of content which does. There are others who invoke the supervenience idea, not as a metaphysical intuition but as a requisite for a genuinely scientific psychology and then draw the same consequence in favor of bifurcation.2 These further arguments, though they raise large and important questions of their own, can be kept apart from the argument from common-sense psychological considerations that I will be focusing on and, indeed, those who have made the latter argument have thought of it as self-standing and independent of the others. The issue it raises is not any the less large and important for having put the others aside, since it poses a deep question about our common-sense psychological states: whence their unity? A vivid sign that that-clause content can fail to capture an agent's psychological contents can be seen in the fact that, looked at one way - perhaps the standard way - it is unable to account for a number of inferences that an agent might make or fail to make. Brian Loar, in a recent paper, gives a good example of this by invoking a variant of Kripke' s puzzle about belief.3 In this example, Pierre learns, while growing up monolingually in Paris, something which he expresses by saying 4 4 Londres est jolie." When, later, Pierre goes and settles in a beautiful section of London and picks up the native language, he is disposed to say 4 4 London 192</page><page sequence="3">is pretty." However, he doesn't realize that the city he learnt about in Paris is the city of which he is now a resident. Now, attributions of psychological content, one expects, will make it come out that Pierre infers from his (earlier) belief that London is the city in which Oscar Wilde lived and his (later) belief that he is now in London,4 that he is now in the city in which Oscar Wilde lived. But he fails to infer it. This is because his conceptions of London (earlier and later) are different. These that-clauses therefore do not capture them. Generalizing from such cases one can easily show that they will often not capture the way in which beliefs interact or fail to interact with other beliefs (and, of course, desires) in order to explain action or absence of action. For instance it would fail to explain why Pierre is doing nothing at all to visit Oscar Wilde's home, something that he intended or wanted to do while in Paris, as soon as he went to London. Thus, it is claimed that we need another notion of content which does not lose its grip on Pierre's conceptions of London and agents' conceptions of things generally. This second notion will impose a taxonomy on inten- tional states that will be more fine-grained than the one provided by that- clauses. In this example Pierre will, by the new taxonomy, have two beliefs about London, as different from each other, as Loar points out, as the beliefs 4 4 London is pretty" and 4 4 Rio is pretty." No problem remains any longer of accounting for how he fails to make the inference. The failure to make it is accounted for precisely because the second notion of content which captures Pierre's conception is, at least partly, individuated in terms of the role of propositional attitudes in inferences, both theoretical and practical.5 It does seem to me that if we did not already have a notion of the content of propositional attitudes which captures an agent's conception of things and the inferential roles of the attitudes, we would have to invent one. For it is in virtue of our conceptions of things that we act upon things, and if content didn't capture these, it would be tantamount to repealing a property of intentional states that we had counted at the outset as unrepealable. However, it will be my claim that it is not necessary to bifurcate content to capture agents' conceptions and that our existing, unified notion of content is quite adequate to that task. So I shall be arguing that there is a way of reconciling the external constitution of content with the role of the attitudes in psychological explanation. To show how this may be done I will first distance the external contributions to content that I favor from others which I don't and which are, I argue, insufficiently or poorly mo- tivated, in any case, by those who favor them. Towards the end I will 193</page><page sequence="4">spend a brief word on basic epistemological reasons for saying something stronger than that bifurcation is not necessary to account for psychological explanation. These reasons are stubbornly old-fashioned and I do not, on the basis of what I fully argue here, expect much agreement. But it will be enough to have established the weaker conclusion and at least to have stated what is at stake in accepting or rejecting the stronger one. II The external elements that have most agitated philosophers in recent years are the social elements. For many, these social elements are fun- damentally constitutive of content as it is given in that-clauses and for some of them it is a sign that these contents cannot play a role in the explanation of an individual agent's behavior. Tyler Bürge, who is most responsible for this awakening to the constitutive nature of the social elements is not, himself, willing to draw any negative conclusions about the place of that-clauses in psychological explanation. Rather he sees psychological explanation and its objects (i.e., the explananda) as infused with the social character of the contents it exploits.6 But others have drawn the negative consequences, and it is a very natural step once one grants to Bürge the general point about the social constitution of content.7 Since Bürge has elaborated at length and in depth upon examples which are meant to reveal the work of the social elements, I will not do so here. Enough to remind you of Bert who thinks that arthritis is a disease that can strike the thigh as well as the joints; remind you also of Bert in a counterfactual social environment, where unlike here, the term 4 'arthritis" is applied to a disease that is not merely of the joints but to a larger class of rheumatoid ailments including one that afflicts thighs. In this counter- factual social setting, Bürge explains that we must not say that Bert's belief which he expresses by saying 4 'I have arthritis in my thigh" is the belief that he has arthritis in his thigh. Whatever else it is a belief about it is not about arthritis which is a disease only of the joints. Only Bert here will be talking about and have beliefs about arthritis, even when he wrongly thinks it is lodged in his thigh. In the counterfactual situation, his belief is about another disease which, to keep things distinct, deserves another name. (And this is so, Bürge insists, even if there is no change in the inner physical or functional descriptions applying to Bert.) Thus our con- cepts and the contents they figure in are constituted by the linguistic norms and conventions of the communities in which we live and speak. 194</page><page sequence="5">I will concede - contra Bürge - that this way of thinking of content and its determinants cripples content for its explanatory function and so forces a second notion of content. Why is this so? The quick, answer is one that I have already touched on: it yields individuations of content too coarse-grained to always capture the inferences or failures of inference in agents to whom they are attributed. For instance, if Bert here knows there is special balm for arthritis and thinks that he should apply it to the condition in his thigh, an account in which concepts, socially constituted in the sense just sketched, will not be in a position to capture the practical reasoning by which he moved from one thought to the other. I said it was the quick answer since it is obviously unfair to Bürge who will insist on describing the inference involved in terms of Bert thinking he should apply the balm to the place where he thinks he has arthritis. This, of course, requires that somewhere in the inferential pattern, Bert believes that he has arthritis in his thigh. Indeed Bürge has all along insisted that this be so. But then we must ask if this premise doesn't, on Burge's own view, imply that Bert has contradictory beliefs every time he is out of step with his community. A prepositional attitude psychology that so straightforwardly and so often runs afoul of the principle of charity will compare very poorly with one which can avoid this consequence, as one can if one moves to a second notion of content. It might be said that one is still unsympathetically foisting implausible positions on Bürge and that he can overcome the difficulty posed by the charity constraints by saying that one only runs afoul of charity if Bert knowingly contradicts himself. After all it can be said that Bert does not always have to know what he believes. To deny this pre- supposes, someone might object, a philosophical prejudice that one by and large knows what one believes.8 But given how extensive an agent's mis- alignment with the experts of his community often is (elms, water, alu- minum ...), this will mean that to a very large extent Bert doesn't know what he believes. The difficulty now is how can these beliefs explain his actions. A prepositional attitude psychology facing this difficulty, though perhaps marginally better than one which attributed widespread self-con- tradictory thought to agents, still fares poorly against one which by ap- pealing to contents more sensitive to agents' conceptions of things (of disease, etc.) will avoid the difficulty. Thus for one reason or another a commitment to Burge's conception of the external element in content would encourage a bifurcation of content. Since I am resisting the urge to bifurcate, I must ask the question: what is the compulsion to say, with Bürge, that that-clause content must be 195</page><page sequence="6">viewed as being socially constituted in this way. I won't try to answer this question immediately . I raise it now only to suggest that it is not compulsory to view things his way. An alternative vision of propositional attitudes emerges when we pay attention to the way Bürge sets things up for his own examples. The example of Bert requires that there be some misalignment between Bert and what the community in which he lives means by 4 4 arthritis." This, of course, will not be a way of describing things that Bürge can allow, but it might be a perfectly acceptable way of describing things in a theoretical treatment of meaning and belief. (For convenience I will restrict myself, as I already have been, to belief among the propositional attitudes.) Some- thing about Bert is discoverable prior to the observation that he is different from the community, even in order to set up the example; in a word, some fact about how he uses words and thinks about a disease. If that were not so people's meanings would be hidden from public view and would be something purely inner to them and not even revealed in their behavior. In that case we would not even be able to arrive at the socially constituted meanings and beliefs that Bürge wants, for how else does one arrive there except by first observing and attributing something (even if not quite what Bürge wants) to individual agents. Since such a view of meaning is in- tolerable to most philosophers, let us take it that such publicness (the discoverability by another) is essential to the study of meaning and belief. But now, if that is so, why not just stop here and say that what is revealed in Bert's sayings and doings in his patterns of assent and dissent, etc., is the primary subject in the philosophical study of the propositional attitudes and of meaning. The social norms and conventions of language which Bürge wishes to constitute the individual's thoughts can, on this picture, be seen as constructible (obviously in quite complex ways) upon what is discovered at this earlier stage. This point does not in any way turn on the fact of misalignment, in Burge's example, between an agent and a community's usage. Misalignment, I've been saying, requires that we first attribute some thing to an agent and then notice a misalignment. The situation is no different if we don't notice any misalignment. The point is that we can think of what we first attribute as meaning and belief. It would be a mistake to think that the only way to repudiate the con- ception of meaning as private and purely inner is to so raise the importance of the social, conventional elements in solving for an agent's meanings that we are stuck with Burge's conception of content. Were we to say, as I've just said, that coherent and viable talk of an agent's meanings and 196</page><page sequence="7">contents has already begun before one notices alignments and misalign- ments between her and the community, that talk is still talk of publicly discoverable items of a person's speech and mentality. At most it needs an agent and someone to discover and attribute meanings and beliefs to her. This can be done quite independently of the discoverer looking to the social and linguistic norms of yet others (though see the qualification below). These themes are familiar from Wittgenstein. Recently interpreters of the mature Wittgenstein, such as Kripke, have emphasized the wider social scene in their effort to capture Wittgenstein's solution or dissolution of the skeptical problem about rule following and meaning. This is, I think, a mistake, though for all I know, not a mistake of interpretation. And it is a mistake which flows from finding the normativity involved in rules or meaning in the wrong place. The notion of norm that emerges from the wider social setting is not a deep or essential part of the concept of meaning as would interest philosophers. A deeper and philosophically more inter- esting normativity can be found when we impose the right sort of constraints on the dispositional view of meaning (opposed by Kripke for its insensi- tivity to norms) that follows from stressing what (by contrast to the wider social setting) I am calling the merely public. I have in mind here just the basic connections between meaning and the minimal constraints of ration- ality on the propositional attitudes of agents - constraints of consistency and inevitably the normativity which is involved when one assumes a background of beliefs from which to attribute beliefs at all.9 To what extent these remarks, if they are correct, will affect or undermine the general approach in Kripke of thinking of the rule-following issue as being con- ceptually prior to those of the public nature of language is an interesting question I cannot explore within the province of this discussion. But, however that should turn out, it seems to me clear that the alternative picture to Cartesian epistemology and Lockean semantics presented by Wittgenstein in the Philosophical Investigations does not in any essential way require the social, over and above the merely public. It will be (and has been) protested that this alternative to Bürge proposes a revisionist conception of that-clause content, that it is a philosopher's invention which distorts our ordinary, everyday practice of the attribution of belief which is non-individualist.10 This is, on the whole, quite possibly correct. But one needs to be given reasons as to why, in a philosophical treatment of the propositional attitudes, one must be slavish to the details of ordinary practice. Is there some philosophical or theoretical urge (or goal) that remains ungratified by deviating from common practice? We 197</page><page sequence="8">have said that there are such goals, certain widely-held epistemological urges, which motivate the imposing of the publicness constraint on meaning and belief . But so far as I can see, there is nothing so urgent and compelling about adopting the further constraint that we should look to the wider social norms and march in step with the everyday practice of belief attribution. And since doing so forces, as we saw, a bifurcation of content, it not merely has the disadvantage of multiplying notions of content, but also (as I will argue later) promotes an undesirable epistemology. Something more direct can also be said against sticking to the everyday practice of content attribution in giving an account of propositional atti- tudes. And that is that, even in many everyday contexts, it can be perverse and misleading to attribute to agents the contents that Bürge' s position demands. It does not need much imagination to think of contexts in which we will not want to say that Bert believes that he has arthritis in his thigh unless we hastily add that he is medically incompetent in the use of that term. And so for any number of terms in which such misalignments may occur between agents and their communities.11 Without the qualification, in these contexts, such reports could seriously misinform and deceive those to whom the reports are being made. But if these qualifications must so often accompany everyday style reporting of a person's beliefs, the great importance being attached to the everyday diminishes considerably. To insist even so that it does not and that the practice is still of decisive philosophical moment is, in my view, as idle as anything we have become used to complaining about in the philsophical style of mid-century Oxford. These remarks of mine in no way compromise my concern to restrict the question of the bifurcation or the unity of intentional states to within the bounds of common-sense psychological considerations. The term "common-sense" here was intended to sound a contrast with efforts at a scientific psychology which has no eventual place for the intentional in its specifications of the explanans or the explananda. Thus common-sense psychology is not to be confused with the haphazard and inattentive at- tribution of that-clause content which might occur in everyday reports of an agent's intentional states. Insistence on care and attention in attribution of these states need not, therefore, be a first step in an eventual, supra- scientific psychology. It merely says that worrying about revising everyday practice in a philosophical treatment is a form of fastidiousness quite unnecessary in a philosophical account of intentionality. It would be un- critical to be misled by the superficially common use of "common" in common-sense psychology and common practice, to think that departure 198</page><page sequence="9">from the latter involves abandoning the former. That would only be so if there was a well-motivated prior desideratum for a philosophical account of content (within the bounds of its role in common-sense psychology) to keep faith with the common practice of content-attribution, not because of the confusing use of an equivocal description. And I'm questioning the claim that there is such a desideratum. Bürge himself, of course, does not trivialize his argument by resting everything upon our slovenly announcements about other people's beliefs. He gathers other sorts of quotidian phenomena to build up his case, facts such as the pervasive tendency to correct our own usage and to bend to the standards of the community. The fact that we have very well established (as well as quite specific) ways of admitting error in our linguistic usage and in our object-level beliefs cannot be denied and it is a fact that needs an explanation. But again we ought to pause at the significance philosophers tend to see in such facts. The question once more is why should these facts affect the constitution of the content of propositional attitudes. If they have an explanation that does not imply that they affect it, would it not be better to stick with the constraints that one cannot do without (such as the publicness constraint), constraints that speak to facts which cannot be accommodated in other ways than by imposing the constraints on the constitution of content. In any case linguistic deference is by no means universal, irrespective of contexts. In many contexts, agents resist deference and do so quite sensibly. Take the case of an agent who has been misusing a term in his community's tongue for some time and who suddenly realizes, say, from looking at a dictionary (or a medical manual) that he has been wrong all along. It is possible to imagine situations in which he next meets someone and will find it much more sensible to continue using the term as he always has rather than defer to the community's usage. In these situations he may think it will cause more strain and confusion for an audience familiar with his mistaken usage, to suddenly start speaking differently. Decisions on this are dictated by specific situations and these are too unsystematic to warrant any single conclusion about what an agent will or must do when he realizes he has been misapplying a term. Saying this does not, by any means, amount to a denial of the ubiquitous fact of linguistic deference, but it does undermine the need to see in it a reason for coming to Burge's conclusions about what constitutes content. And even when that is un- dermined, it still does not mean that the fact of linguistic deference does not need an explanation. But if the strong conclusion is undermined, more 199</page><page sequence="10">obvious pragmatic and historical explanations can be introduced. Naturally, if we wish to be understood and understood without strain, we will by and large (except in unusual circumstances such as those just mentioned) use words as others do. Naturally, if we've been brought up in the same social environment and our words and beliefs have been formed in it, our mean- ings will tend to converge and especially so if we want to bring others up in it. And so on. These pragmatic and historical considerations stand independent of what goes into the attribution of beliefs and meanings to individual agents. Earlier, I had expressed the point by saying that what is essential to such attribution does not require looking at anybody over and above the agent himself. This may have given the impression that others in his community need not figure at all in the evidence on which these attributions are made. That may not be quite right, so let me qualify the claim, (the qualification will not, however, affect my opposition to Bürge' s anti-individualism.) Dependence of an agent on some others in his community is sometimes, perhaps, inevitable. This is part of the point that Putnam was emphasizing when he spoke of the linguistic division of labor. 12 If an agent relies on experts to pick out a certain kind of thing from others (an elm tree from a beech tree or from other trees in general) without in any serious way getting fully educated into the criteria for such individuation, it does mean that we will only accurately discover what he means and believes by observing his dependence on at least some others in his community, and not entirely independently of them as my previous remarks suggested. However, the reason this is not a threat for the sort of individualism I'm protecting against Bürge is that, to put it crudely, his reliance on others is part of his concept of an elm tree. He does not have the same concept of an elm tree as the experts themselves have. He picks out the same things as they do but the beliefs via which he does so will be different from those by which the experts pick them out. And since in my picture an individual's beliefs determine what concepts are to be attributed to him,13 we will have to distinguish between the concepts of an elm tree that the relying agent has and the experts have. And in turn, we will have to distinguish their relevant contents. It will be a crucial part of the relying agent's conception of an elm tree that he believes that elm trees are what the experts around him say they are. The experts' conceptions are likely to be determined by more purely dendrological beliefs. Thus in conceding that my earlier re- marks were misleading all I am conceding is that it would be misleading to think that my view entails that we can always accurately attribute con- 200</page><page sequence="11">cepts and contents to an agent by treating him as if he were Robinson Crusoe,14 in absolute isolation from his fellows. But since bringing in the others does not entail for me that the agent and the others share the relevant concepts, it does not amount to anything like the view that contents are constituted by the linguistic norms of the others in the community. The concession raises no difficulty of the order of agents failing to know their own beliefs or having contradictory beliefs attributed to them as Bürge' s view does, i.e. , it raises no difficulties that force a bifurcation of content. Let me sum and conclude this section by highlighting its main conclusion that there is no sense of the social constitution of contents over and above their public discoverability that is compulsory in a theoretical account of propositional attitudes. One recalls that in a famous opening sentence of Word and Object Quine makes a clear commitment to the idea that language is a 4 4 social art." But very quickly after one finds that it would be in a deep sense question-begging if we believed that one's neighbors or even one's own family members spoke the same language as one. That is something we would really be allowed to say - even if we assume it all along - only if we turned up the same 4 'analytical hypotheses" for them as someone might for us; turned up, that is to say, overlapping concepts and contents. It is true that there will be some society involved prior to this - the one for whom the hypotheses are being turned up and the one who is turning them up. But the denial that we may even assume as philosophers, prior to the delivery of the hypotheses, that any other than the speaker speaks a given language (of course keeping in mind the qual- ification just made) strongly suggests that what is essential to the philo- sophical understanding of language need not involve, in the sense required by Bürge, what these others do or say.15 That there should be an agent and attributor at least is already implicit in the idea that meaning is publicly discoverable. One could, I suppose, even deny the need for the attributor since discoverability does not strictly require one, but it may be a handy device to have him in order to keep us honest against the slide into privacy. It might be objected that thinking of the social aspects of language in terms of overlapping idiolects leaves out from that aspect its basic feature, viz., that we participate in a common practice and that we do not merely happen to do the same thing (as the overlapping idiolects idea suggests). However, that suggestion is not intended by that idea. The point is not to deny the element of participation but rather to insist that in order to get to the central core of meaning and content, that element is not essential. What is essential is not participation in the same practice because one can manage with less, 201</page><page sequence="12">i.e., understanding what is communicated, without such participation. The element of participation can be got at by giving the sort of pragmatic and historical explanations cited above. So whatever Quine may have meant in that opening sentence when he described language as social, it could not be what Bürge intends. And whatever he meant, that is all that the publicness requirement demands and all that is necessary for the tasks at hand. If my overall argument has been persuasive, no unavoidable or otherwise unexplainable phenomenon has been cited which forces us to lay down social constraints stronger than that requirement. Considerations of the everyday or common practice of that-clause attribution, of linguistic deference and admission of error, and of the social formation of patterns of thought and speech are, in one way or another, lacking the significance - or the sort of philosophical signif- icance - that Bürge and his supporters have thought them to have. Since it was the concessions to Burge's view of the way in which external social elements constitute content that created the need to seek its bifur- cation, then, if the argument is persuasive, that need may properly be thought to have lapsed. Ill It has been a central part of my rejection of the social elements to distinguish them from the publicness constraint which I do accept as fun- damental to content, as almost anybody would. A question, then, arises about what makes for this public character of content. There is, no doubt, more than one answer to this question and answers that are not always going to be compatible with one another. One answer that comes imme- diately to mind is to exploit in some way the external causal element that many philosophers have seen as relevant to language and thought.16 If causes external to agents play a role in determining content, then content could hardly fail to be publicly available. It does seem to me that this way of meeting the publicness constraint is the most natural way to meet it, though those who have connected external cause with content have not always been motivated by this constraint at all. This point about its nat- uralness, I will take up at the end of the paper when I contrast it with other answers to the question, answers which seem to be to take concepts like meaning and content unnaturally far away from the context of com- munication and making sense of people in which these concepts reside. 202</page><page sequence="13">Why do I raise the matter of the external causal answer to the question here? Because on the face of it, it gives the bifurcationist another oppor- tunity to deny the assumption of the unity of the propositional attitudes. For quite apart from the social elements these causal elements can also be seen to bring in to content the very sort of extraneous features that unsuit them for psychological explanation. The events, objects or states of affairs external to agents that stand in causal relations to our concepts and contents may be thought to be individuated in far more coarse-grained ways (or, for that matter, in less coarse-grained ways) than our ways of conceiving them. And since, as we've said, it is our conceptions of these things that are relevant to psychological explanation, contents determined by these external causes will not be subtle enough instruments to play that explan- atory role. Examples such as those in Kripke and Frege style puzzles about belief and identity can be multiplied to make this point.17 (This failure of calibration between the deliverances of the external causal method of con- tent-determination and the contents required for psychology emerges in the obverse way for a different sort of example to be found in the philo- sophical literature urging bifurcation: the twin-earth examples. In the ex- ample of Kripke' s puzzle or its variants, the failure resulted in the method of delivering one belief where psychology demands two; in the twin-earth cases, the external determinants will deliver two beliefs where the psy- chology for twin-agents demands only one. I will return to the twin-earth examples in section V.) The general idea of external causes determining that-clause content may quite properly be regarded as the other side of the idea that belief-contents given in that-clauses are individuated by truth-conditions. It is this con- nection which makes clear why the deep question raised by Hartry Field at the close of his paper "Tarski' s Theory of Truth,"18 - the question, why or when do we need the concept of truth? - must eventually be brought around to the question why does one need the concept of content constituted by external causal elements? In this section and the next, I will be taking the view that the concept of truth and the concept of content externally determined do have a role in the psychological explanation of an agent's actions, but only if we work with the right notion of truth-conditions and place the right constraints on such external determination. If the question of truth-conditions and the question of external determinants are the same sort of question posed in different ways, then imposing the right constraints on these determinants should, by itself, yield the appropriate notion of truth-conditions. I do not 203</page><page sequence="14">want to enter into a pointless terminological dispute about whether, once these constraints are applied, what we really get are truth- conditions. In the next section I will try and say in what sense they are, but if someone wishes to quarrel with the words, I am happy to abandon the word and stick with the substance of the external causal point, for that is what is crucial.19 I have said that the publicness of content may be grounded by exploiting the causal connection philosophers have seen between external events and language as well as thought. But there does not seem to be a single view about the connection that one can exploit. In what follows I will distance the externalism which I think affords a unified conception of content from some other ways of thinking of the external causal connections which don't. Given the obvious relations that the truth-conditions of our beliefs or sentences have with our concepts or the reference of our terms, our notion of truth-conditions will turn on how we characterize the latter. Now if we looked to causal theories of reference as they are standardly thought of in the philosophical literature20 (or if we looked to their more general anti- Fregean kin, the theories of 'direct' reference), then it is fairly obvious that we would have appealed to the causal element (or more generally, external element) as entering content and determining truth-conditions in a way that would spoil them for their explanatory tasks. Why is that? The right answer to this question reveals what is essential to producing an externalist account of content that is good for psychology. The traditional causal theories of reference have emphasized the story of the introduction of terms in an initial situation of baptism and then the narrative continues through the historical chain by which it arrived at the particular agent's speech. In this story one pays no special attention to the beliefs of particular agents. They have no role at all in determining their conceptions, i.e., the reference of their terms. Such a fiercely externalist picture of our concepts will unsurprisingly yield a picture of content that stands aloof from a person's psychology. The notion of truth-conditions that will individuate contents, in this picture, cannot be characterized even in part as having anything to do with the inferential role those beliefs have or with an agent's conception of things. Small wonder, then, that Kripke style puzzles will abound for such a picture of content and that bifurcation will be inevitable. It would be a mistake to think that the source of the difficulty here lies entirely in the fact that these theories look to the external causal connections at the level of the reference of terms or at the level of concepts. Thus it 204</page><page sequence="15">won't do, for instance, to think things would improve if we left out the whole story of baptism and the subsequent historical chain and looked simply to direct causal connections between external events and beliefs. Causal accounts of content such as the information-theoretic account of- fered by Dretske and those others inspired by that general strategy, such as Fodor's and Stampe's, make something like this move but altogether fail to repair what is fundamentally wrong with the traditional causal account.21 The real difficulty with the traditional account is not just what these others are prepared to overthrow but rather that it fixes an agent's concepts with no regard to his other beliefs. The turn to a causal account of belief-tokens rather than the historical story about terms will not help if it fails in the same way. One may ask the question, as Fodor does, where do truth-conditions come from, and give the answer that he and others have given which cite the causal connection between an agent's representations22 and facts or states of affairs (picked out by '-ing' nom- inais); but so long as one describes these latter, the causes, without taking into account the agent's other beliefs, we will end up with truth-conditions individuating psychological powerless contents. The challenge to be faced was how to appeal to external causes as an essential element of thoughts without giving up on their explanatory po- tential in doing so. And I'm saying there is no hope that both these things can be done except by constraining the causal element by the other beliefs of an agent. This is just to say that it is absolutely crucial how one describes the causes: one must describe them in a way that does not make the belief- content it determines stand out on a limb from an agent's other beliefs. So, in a crude example, one would quite simply not describe the cause of a person's uttering or believing something as being caused by a credit- card if one is not confident that he has other beliefs, however rudimentary, regarding systems of finance and credit. If, by this method, one could not describe the cause that way one would not end up attributing the concept of a credit-card to the agent and so no contents relating to credit-cards. This entire appeal to external causes presupposes that an agent's index- ically formulated beliefs or utterances about saliences in the world around him will be central in the method of the attribution of concepts and contents. For it is with these that one can most easily identify the external causes. They are the points of entry, therefore, into another's mind, since they are the first clear clues to the public sources of another's meanings. This, however, in no way implies a commitment to a foundationalism of an externalist (as opposed to the traditional internalist) variety. Even for this 205</page><page sequence="16">ground floor of indexically formulated utterances and beliefs by which one enters another's mind, the causes we pick out have to be described as they cohere with the other beliefs. Hence the method at the ground floor is a convenient starting point in the building of a theoretical structure of an- other's beliefs and concepts, but it is built like Neurath's boat, and con- clusions about the ground floor are just as revisable if they will not lend themselves to a coherent picture. Some causal links may be more direct than others, i.e., less mediated by surrounding beliefs than others - for instance those with beliefs about thin, little, rectangular plastic objects rather than beliefs about credit-cards. But there are no unmediated causal links. There is no getting away from this and the appeal to external causality is not intended to stop or interrupt a holistic pattern. Holism and external cause are both absolutely essential features of content and they are perfectly compatible. The latter allows for the public character of content (and, as I will argue, allows for a plausible general epistemology) and the former as it constrains the latter allows for its inferential and explanatory potential. Those, like Fodor and Dretske, who emphasize this causal element without this constraint have their own reasons for doing so. There is one reason that comes to mind in the present context, which may be worth a brief mention. First, one may find that such a holistic constraint is an embarrassment to the idea that one can be a subject of beliefs and have a very few, perhaps even just one belief.23 I do think that reflection upon the nature of belief (the very sort of considerations about explanatory role and inferential role that this paper is addressing) would suggest that it is the idea itself which is untenable. Fodor claims that a denial of the idea and the embrace of holism would preempt any possibility of taking a realist view of belief. I have already denied any obvious connection between a holism about the propositional attitudes and taking an instrumenalist view about them (see footnote 5). Whether one is a realist or instrumentalist about such states turns not on whether one thinks of them as holistically constrained, but on whether there is enough of a certain sort of complexity in the behavior of a subject to whom they are being attributed, such that the attributions are not merely a way of speaking but an indispensable part of making sense of the subject. Those who take a more relaxed view of such attributions, and refuse to distinguish between when it is a mere way of speaking and when it is indispensable, are taking an instrumentalist view of the attributions. It would take us too far afield to try and spell out the sort of patterns of complexity that are crucial (not an easy task, anyway) but if I'm right that that is what is crucial (i.e., that certain concepts like 206</page><page sequence="17">intentionality take real hold only under certain conditions of complex behavior), then, contrary to Fodor's conception of realism about them, the attribution of just a very few intentional states to a subject is merely an anthropomorphic way of talking and not descriptive of real things. (This theme is echoed in the later discussion of meaning- vs. theory-change where I argue that it would be wrong to think, as Fodor does, that holism about belief implies that we hardly ever have the same belief or concepts from one moment to the next.) In repudiating external causality as it enters in traditional causal theories of reference or in accounts such as Dretske's and Fodor's what alternative is being proposed? It is, as I said, a method which looks to the external cause under a description that makes it relevant to our concepts and in turn our contents, so that one that doesn't unsuit these latter as psycho- logical states. In this picture the relationship between external cause and psychological content is not a straightforward one. The causes (properly described in coherence with an agent's other beliefs) are first to be seen as evidence in the task of attributing concepts (or mastery of terms) to an agent. Looking thus first to the indexically formulated utterances of an agent (and sifting out the lies, metaphors, pretenses, etc., from the sincere utterances of the agent by some method or other - no single method comes to mind as an algorithm), one correlates them with external causes (constrained as above); and enough such correlations will be rough initial evidence for attributing some concepts (attributions revisable as more at- tributions are made on further evidence). Thus sincere utterances such as 4 'That horse is black," "That horse is lame," "That horse is running" might be correlated with causes describable as events or states of affairs such as that horse's being black, that horse's being lame, etc., so as to tease out the attribution of the concept of a horse to the utterer. Another evidential story can be told with utterances such as "That horse is black," "That car is black," "That crow is black" and the concept of black. And so on. The details of the method can get complex when the concepts involved are more theoretical - one has to be more careful in describing the concept-determining causes in consonance with the other beliefs one finds it plausible to attribute to the agent.24 Details apart, the point I am stressing is that it is not a causal theory of content in any direct way. The causal relations between states of affairs and whole utterances of sentences are evidence for the attribution of con- cepts . That is where they enter into the notion of content, and content itself analyzable in terms of composition, by some routine method, out of 207</page><page sequence="18">the concepts. It is hard to stress enough this two-stage process by which causality enters content. It is precisely a failure to do so that results in certain externalist notions of content (such as Gareth Evans') that I will criticize later.25 The issue of whether an externally constituted notion of content can itself be psychologically efficacious can be seen to be the flip side of the issue whether we can come up with a referential or truth-conditional notion of content that is psychologically efficacious. It is in these mutually related questions that the depth and interest of the issues about bifurcation lie and not any question about whether that-clause content is psychologically ef- fective. If one cares to one can produce that-clause specifications of content whatever stand one takes on the deep issues, i.e., one can produce that- clauses to specify contents individuated by a properly constrained exter- nalism and the soft notion of truth-conditions it implies, or one can produce them for the type of social and causally constituted externalist and truth- conditional contents I am opposing. One can even produce them for notions of content that fall outside of all these alternatives, such as a purely verificationist notion of content that leaves out external elements and truth- conditions altogether. If this is right, then rather than fuss about what our ordinary use of that-clauses is, we may treat the whole question of that- clauses which I began with as a superficial face masking the real questions about externalism and truth-conditions in the study of content. IV I have talked a lot about truth- conditions as the flip side of externalist notions of content, and the time has come to elaborate the reasons for calling them that since someone may want to ask whether the constraints I'm imposing on the external elements do not, after all, have the effect of divorcing content from truth-conditions. Were we even to answer this question in the affirmative, we should pause a little when we notice the possibility of saying, nevertheless, that truth -theories of a certain kind may still be used to specify our concepts and so give the contents of beliefs. And their use here is not merely to serve the demands of compositionality, but also in that they capture an agent's knowledge and relations to the world, i.e., the right hand sides of the theorems of a Tarski style truth- theory would allow for these relations between an agent's thoughts and the world external to him. 208</page><page sequence="19">The truth-theories, however, would now have to be formulated with somewhat greater care than if one did not see them as being put to the use of capturing an agent's conceptions and contents. The care must obviously lie in what one puts on the right hand sides of the axioms and theorems. One can bring this out with the example of Pierre's contents discussed earlier. Recall that the challenge was to make it come out that Pierre had two beliefs rather than one without giving up on the externalism or the truth-conditions. Only then could one capture his conceptions for psy- chology without moving to a second notion of content. Pierre has two beliefs because he has two conceptions of London. This suggests that we should invent a term for his second conception. So in constructing a theory we would have axioms for "London" and (helping ourselves to the earlier word) "Londres" in order to keep track of his two conceptions. And further, we would on the right hand side of these axioms be careful to use London and Londres , respectively, even though we may be perfectly aware of the fact that Pierre's different conceptions are conceptions of the same city. The theory after all is a theory of content for Pierre. Thus equivalent truth-theories will not necessarily be equally good as theories of contents for given agents. What might be good for us would be quite wrong for Pierre; i.e., a theory which contains the axioms, 4 "London" refers to London,' and 4 "Londres" refers to London' though fine for us would quite fail to capture Pierre's conceptions and would not allow us to say what we need to say (that he has two London-beliefs) in order to resolve Kripke style puzzles. We should not be misled by the extensional nature of truth-theories and our own knowledge of the relevant identities to aban- don scruple and care about what we place on the right hand sides of the axioms. Only a theory which has the two distinct right hand side entries for "London" and "Londres" will summarize the different beliefs that go into Pierre's different conceptions of London. These different beliefs are the evidence on the basis of which we conclude that Pierre has two different conceptions. It is important, therefore, to realize that these truth-theories serving as theories of content are much more than the simple-seeming axioms suggest, i.e. , they carry with them much more than what these clauses make explicit. Thus if we say that it is (partly) in virtue of tacit knowledge of these theories that agents say what they say and do what they do, we are not merely saying that they know what these axioms explicitly state, but rather we are saying that they have all the beliefs that are crystallized in these axioms.26 So though the different sets of beliefs about London that Pierre 209</page><page sequence="20">has in virtue of which we say he has two different conceptions are not stated by the axioms of the theory, the different axioms for "London" and for "Londres" invisibly carry these different sets of beliefs. An eyebrow may be raised about why the need for this implicit pres- entation in a truth-theory. Why not lay all the beliefs out explicitly and abandon the truth-theoretic formulation, or at any rate abandon the truth- theory for the purpose of capturing an agent's conceptions of things and leave it for other purposes, if necessary? What good is a theory which merely summarizes the information that goes into psychological expla- nation? And what prevents us from stating that information in a theory? There is nothing in itself wrong with a theory that doesn't explicitly state all the information it carries, but there are strong reasons to think that that cannot in any case be done. We very often do not know how to make all the information involved explicit. There are very serious limitations to how much we can verbalize and intellectualize the cognitive states being summarized in these truth-theories, and an effort to do so will only impose a distorting neatness on the highly messy variety of states that are integrated in our application of concepts. The fact of our constant appeal to dem- onstratives to integrate what goes into the mastery of concepts (a man is in pain when he wears that sort of expression) is a clear sign that these cognitive states will resist explicit statement in a theory. Thus to expect a theory of meaning or content to do more than the truth-theories sketched above will do is to yearn to take a reductive and distortive path quite inappropriate for the psychological and semantical tasks at hand. It is instructive to compare the account of psychological content which emerges by exploiting such truth-theories with Donald Davidson's account, which has a somewhat different role for truth-theories. It is not that Dav- idson fails to produce an overall account that is satisfying for psychological explanation (as the other externally constituted theories I've discussed so far fail to do). Rather, he sees no need to give special theoretical status to people's conceptions of things since, for him, that idea is caught up with a murky, traditional conception of meaning that Quine successfully repudiates with his attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction. Davidson's account of content or meaning has two components.27 One component is a theory which yields as its consequences truth-conditions for the sentences of a person's speech, and the second is a list of a person's beliefs. (I am ignoring a third component that lists a person's desires since that is not essential to my making the comparisons I want to make.) He calls the first the meaning component and the second the belief component. 210</page><page sequence="21">Together they are a theory for a person, i.e., for his behavior. In this double-barreled theory, Kripke' s puzzle is not accommodated by tampering with the idea of a truth-theory as suggested above. That would be to unnecessarily chase the idea of an agent's conceptions of things. Thus there is no need to represent in the truth-theory itself (by discriminating right hand sides in the axioms) the different sets of beliefs Pierre has associated with "London" and with "Londres." The clauses that a radical interpreter would deliver in a Davidsonian theory would say that * 4 London' ' refers to London, and "Londres" refers to London. Now, to the protest that this would make Pierre (in Kripke's puzzle) come out as logically contradicting himself when he isn't, Davidson's double-barreled account can offer the following reply: that is only so if you forget about the belief component, where Pierre's beliefs are given. Once one pointed out that this component lacks the identity-belief that London is Londres, the ap- pearance of logical idiocy and the puzzle itself would disappear. If Pierre doesn't believe that London is Londres he is not (as it might seem if one looked just at the truth-theory) contradicting himself. So it is only as a combined theory giving truth-conditions and a list of beliefs that one will provide psychological explanation of behavior. Notice, however, that though he calls the first of the components a meaning-theory, it does not capture meaning in the sense of agents' con- ceptions as we have been discussing them. The combined theory has no special place for the very thing that truth-theories formulated in the more fine-grained way were intended to capture. So if one thinks that that is worth capturing since agents act upon things in virtue of the ways they conceive them, one would have to produce the more fine-grained for- mulation. It does not seem to me that an animus (derived from a rejection of the analytic-synthetic distinction) against the very idea of agents' conceptions is enough reason to ignore the virtues of the fine-grained formulations. Nothing in these representations gives rise to the difficulties that worried Quine, for they do not employ uncritical or unanalyzed notions like syn- onymy, nor do they stand opposed to the holistic character of an agent's concepts and meanings. But I shouldn't give the impression that a Quinean skepticism about traditional notions of meaning is the sole reason for Davidson preferring to work with different truth-theoretic formulations. Here is another motivation that might compel. If one insists on capturing all the fineness of grain that goes into agents' conceptions of things, it is more than likely that one will be in the position of collapsing all change 211</page><page sequence="22">or disagreement in belief or theory into change or disagreement in meaning, that is, since agents' conceptions derive so much from their beliefs. In fact, this would also be the most sensible way of motivating the other externalist and truth-theoretic accounts we have been criticizing so far. Though I will address the Davidsonian truth-theories, as far as this point goes there isn't much difference between his and these others. They can all claim the advantage against the style of theorizing I favor on the ground that they alone can provide the necessary anchor for our concepts which would allow us to say (what we often want to say) that we have changed our beliefs or theories rather than our meanings.28 Generally speaking, it is quite correct to say that Davidson's truth-theoretic component will have an easier time of distinguishing theory-change from meaning-change. How- ever, it is arguable that the real lesson to be learned from the work of Quine and Davidson's own rejection of the analytic-synthetic distinction is that we should not be perturbed by whether to describe something as a case of change in theory or a change in meaning. After all Davidson himself has claimed that with enough changes in the belief component, one can accommodate any change in the meaning component. So the point must be that doing things my way allows for absolute anarchy, no way at all of registering disagreement over or change of belief. But is that really so? I am not denying that in any particular case where one has a strong intuition that there is a case of theory-change rather than meaning-change, one should not have the resources to express the intuition. In fact my account has those resources. I am only saying that an appreciation of the untenability of the analytic-synthetic distinction cancels at a general level the worry that one's account of content will not distinguish theory-change from mean- ing-change. And it is only at this level of worry that one would be prompted to look for anchors in one's theory of content of the kind missing in my account. In my account one can meet the intuition that in a particular case a change is a change of theory by looking for what is constant over the change of beliefs and determining concepts or meaning accordingly. Once meanings are determined thus, one can against them describe the changes as changes in theory. These invariances take the place of the anchors sought by Davidsonian truth-theories and causal theories of reference, etc. (in the case of disagreement it will be the overlap in beliefs between agents which will substitute for the anchors). Often these invariances will be very slight, but that cannot be a disadvantage since it is only that invariance which can be the source of the intuition about that particular change being a 212</page><page sequence="23">change of belief. The intuition ought not to be based on anything more substantial than what remains steady among the beliefs despite the changes. Thus, for instance, suppose we do feel very strongly that despite the vastly divergent theories of an ancient Greek astronomer and a contemporary astronomer, these theories are still divergent theories about the same thing, say, stars. That is not a problem for me since what allows for that intuition is not some clause in a truth-theory which altogether fails to capture the Greek astronomer's conception of a star, but the common beliefs, however few, that the temporally distant astronomers share (that stars are what we see when we look toward the sky at night, etc.). By giving fine-grained accounts of content and noticing overlapping beliefs we will be easily able to specify the invariances necessary to meet the intuition. Thus there is no need to emphasize truth-conditions fixed by the interpreter's lights or to place weights on those beliefs the interpreter considers essential to the mastery of concepts. Meaning, intuitively speaking, is just what is invariant over change or disagreement in beliefs and that is what a theory of content should display if it can. Davidson has of course argued very persuasively for the conclusion that there cannot be all that much difference between what an interpreter be- lieves and what an agent whom he is interpreting believes. That is the argument from the interdependence of meaning and belief, sometimes misleadingly called the argument from charity. But that, in itself, need not be conclusive reason for formulating truth-theories for agents along Davidson's lines. The conclusion of that argument, to the extent that it is persuasive, will be reflected in the fact that truth-theories of the more fine- grained variety will by and large have overlapping clauses for different agents. Still it is worth retaining the fineness of grain in the formulations in order to preserve in detail the differences in conceptions where they exist. It will seem to many that these truth-conditions offered by my account are only truth-conditions by courtesy. It is not easy to be sure what underlies such disappointment. I am not making truth-conditions subjective or rel- ative to anything simply by representing them as an agent conceives of them. Nor does this, in any way, impeach the externalism in content established in the last section. But, as I said earlier, if there are those who do not find enough prestige in the notion I've promoted to allow it the name "truth" or "truth-condition," I am prepared to be amicable about the words. What I am not prepared to be amicable about is calling my position verificationism. This nomenclature reflects, if nothing else, a 213</page><page sequence="24">historical obtuseness. "Verificationism' ' is a label for a fairly specific doctrine which bears little resemblance to the position which emerges in the last two sections. The chief difference lies in the fact that verificationism has always had a strong anti-holistic strain. That is why it is possible to think of the view of Michael Dummett on meaning as belonging to that tradition. My position has explicitly embraced constraints that shun that aspect of verificationism. Quite apart from the historical point, it is hardly of any interest to describe a view of meaning or content as verificationist if the holism essential to the view destroys the idea that there are any canonical verification-conditions for any given sentence. Opposition to verificationism comes with an insistence that the canonical class of veri- fying statements may be established, but the sentence being verified by these, may still be false. My view certainly allows for that insistence. It thus rejects any division of beliefs or statements into classes that is inherent to any interestingly distinctive position deserving the label 4 'verification- ism." Only confusion can result by refusing to make distinctions where they are obvious to anyone not caught up in the polemical potential of certain labels. V At the very outset of the paper I described the threat to what I called the unity of the propositional attitudes as coming from the difficulty of uniting their psychological with their external elements in certain examples cited in recent literature. So far I have said a good deal about the example of Pierre in Kripkean puzzles. In another well-known type of example, the twin-earth cases, there lies a similar threat to unity though it takes a contrary form. Here considerations of agents' conceptions and inferential role are supposed to force the opposite taxonomy than in the Pierre puzzle. Where with Pierre, external elements impose too coarse-grained a tax- onomy, in the twin-earth cases they are supposed to impose an unneces- sarily fine-grained one; unnecessarily so, that is, for psychological expla- nation. An agent and his twin on twin-earth both innocent of chemistry might use a word like "water" in expressing beliefs and desires which explain some action of theirs, say, the act of drinking water, because each desires that his thirst be quenched and believes that drinking water will quench it. The argument, as it standardly proceeds, points out that the chemical composition of the substance being talked and thought about is quite different and so, in a sense, is the thought and the talk. But in a 214</page><page sequence="25">quite other sense, the one relevant to psychology, the thought and the talk are not interestingly different. One would not think the explanations of their respective actions as being different in any interesting sense. Looking to the external element as constitutive of content (the chemically constituted substance) would turn up two different beliefs for the twins, where looking to psychologically relevant facts, involving the twin's conceptions or the inferential roles of the beliefs, would turn up just one. Thus two different notions of content will be at work and not a unified conception. In response I can say consistently with the position outlined in the preceding sections, that if one understood the constraints on the appeal to external causality (and on the notion of truth-conditions that follows upon that), then such bifurcation is avoidable. In particular cases such as the example about "water," since the external causal elements are being constrained by the agent's other beliefs (here, none reflect awareness of chemical composition), it will be perfectly possible to say that there is only one belief: the belief that water quenches thirst (leaving out for the sake of convenience the indexicals). Thus despite appealing to substances in the environments of agents, different concepts and contents need not be attributed to twins, as they certainly would have to be in Putnam's and others' elaboration of twin-earth examples.29 Our quite different role for distal causality in content-attribution allows us to have it both ways: the externalism as well as (in this sort of example) a coarse-grained, psycho- logically sensitive taxonomy.30 There is no need therefore, if I'm right, to posit for either the Pierre or the twin-earth type of example a notion of psychological content that contrasts with the notion of content I've just sketched along general ex- ternalist lines. Thus for instance Putnam's suggestion that Dummett's ver- ificationist semantics is needed over and above externalist content,31 or Loar's recent suggestion that we need a notion of 'realizability-conditions' ("what the world would be like if an agent's conceptions were not mis- conceptions"),32 or Dennett's suggestion that we need a 'bracketed' notion of content specified in terms of 4 hetero-phenomenology ' 33 - these are all unnecessary. These further notions of non-externalist content have no longer any role to play because a proper understanding of the external element's contribution does not give rise to the unreachability of the psy- chological element which motivated them in the first place. All this, obviously, takes for granted that the problems raised by Krip- kean and twin-earth puzzles are not made comprehensive, i.e., not applied across the board to all the terms in the language, terms which were held 215</page><page sequence="26">steady in these puzzles to produce the requisite contrast to the problematic terms (such as 4 'water") so as to give the problem they give rise to real bite. Making the puzzles comprehensive would then mean that twin- worlds will not only fail to have the isolated substances called "water" sharing the same chemical composition, but analogous divergences for all the things in the environment referred to by the shared vocabulary of twin-languages. If we were to allow this to spread across the board for the entire vocabulary (or at any rate that portion of the vocabulary purporting to refer to items and properties in the external world), there would be a scenario in which these other specifications of content mentioned in the last paragraph would have real appeal; for now the externalist element even in my constrained form and truth-conditions in my attenuated sense would have to give way to something else. But so long as we are not entertaining this utterly implausible scenario, there is no need whatever to generate these further notions of content. An analogy with the more specific case of perceptual content may help to make this point clear. It is a very poor philosophical maneuver to argue on the grounds that we can sometimes be mistaken in our perceptual beliefs that we ought to generate a second notion of perceptual content which is quite independent of external elements (and not individuated in terms of truth-conditions at all), so as to be able to say that the contents are shared by the hallucinator and the veridical perceiver. It should be possible, without any sleight of hand, to be able to say that both agents share contents and contents which are externally determined and individuated by truth- conditions. There simply isn't any need for a second internalist notion of shared content, given isolated cases of hallucination. Only if one thought hallucination could be comprehensive would one worry that this second notion might be called for. Hence, so long as one doesn't entertain, what no one believes anyway, that the sort of puzzles we have been discussing can be allowed to arise not just for isolated terms but for all terms purporting to refer to the environment (or in the specific case of perceptual content, so long as one didn't entertain the unbelievable conclusion of an argument from illusion), we may stick with the unified notion of content. Something stronger, I think, can be claimed though it would be im- possible to argue for it here. There are general reasons to think that to entertain such a comprehensive extension of the puzzles is to entertain something not entirely coherent. Even if no complete argument can be given here for this stronger conclusion, it may be worth raising a question or two in the direction of giving it. If this achieved no more than getting 216</page><page sequence="27">those who find the internalist scenario coherent to answer these questions without giving up on the internalist conception of mind, that would be quite enough. An initial question is: can the contents of one's intentional states be described in this scenario (where the problem extends to the entire vocabulary purporting to refer to objects and features of the external world) without appeal to such vocabulary at all? The failure of various phenom- enalist efforts strongly suggest that they cannot be so described. If that's right, one must follow up with a question that is less often raised, but is critical. Why is it that a program for the interior specification of the mind finds itself indispensably employing a vocabulary that purports to refer to the very objects and features that this program denies as determining the contents of the mind? I think the answer to this question is not easy to spell out briefly and it involves epistemological considerations somewhat removed from the immediate context of psychological content. But I be- lieve that the right answer to the question implies the falsity of internalism itself. Quite apart from these questions and the need for their addressing, the issues at stake in the controversy over the unity of content should be out in the open by now. Though the arguments made against unity summarized at the beginning of the paper were not made with this extreme scenario in mind, it is only at the point of this scenario (one which is, at best, not believed by anyone, at worst, and more correctly, incoherent) that the unity of content is threatened at all. There are and have been philosophers who are sympathetic as I am to the anti-internalist, anti-Cartesian conception of mind and who are opposed as I am to multiplying notions of content, but who take a quite different view of how this should be opposed. Gareth Evans and John McDowell and others have recently suggested that Cartesianism must be shown to be wrong by thinking of our singular thoughts as being 'Russellian' in the sense that if there is no object that the singular thought is a thought about, then strictly speaking there is no singular thought at all.34 What is added to Russell by these philosophers is that these singular thoughts can be about objects in the world external to agents. As Evans says, 4 Tor example, an internal state can be ascribed the content that this table is round only if there is a particular object it is about and on which it is causally de- pendent. ' ' The motive for saying this is to deny a second notion of content. He says, "There is no neutral or 'existence-independent' specification of this content to which we can retreat if the subject is hallucinating." Thus, for Evans, one should refuse to move to a second notion of psychological 217</page><page sequence="28">content that is shared by hallucinator and veridical perceiver, not because, as I have been saying, the already available content this table is round is perfectly adequate, but because as he says 4 4 If there is no object (whether or not the subject believes there is) there is no content - no thought." Evans concludes this passage with a anti-Cartesian sentiment: "... and this means that if the ideal description of mental life ... is one which carries absolutely no commitments about the nature of the organism's environ- ment, then it is an unattainable ideal." I entirely concur with this last sentence as I do with the denial of a second notion of content. But I disagree with all that Evans says in leading up to these conclusions. I see little reason to deny what is intuitive and obvious: that a hallucinator and a veridical perceiver do share a thought; and it is the shared thought that is of interest in psychological explanation,35 for it will explain common actions of these agents, actions describable, for instance, as reaching out in a certain way, believing as they do that the table is round rather than, say, square. The important point is that this commitment to a shared thought requires no retreat from the ordinary truth- conditional and externalist content and is no concession at all to Carte- sianism. What does the difference between Evans' opposition to Cartesianism and mine amount to? It lies in the fact that for me the external causal contributions to content come by an indirect method in which it is concepts that are first attributed to agents on the basis of observing causal relations with external items in the manner described in section III. This indirection results in the connection between external objects and contents being a very general one. There is, therefore, no requirement that for any particular case where an object doesn't exist that there is no content of the relevant kind. Since it is concepts like table, round, water, etc., which get fixed (though 'fixed' suggests something stronger than the method of section III strictly implies) by looking to certain causal relations (under the appropriate constraints), particular contents are still in place if objects that they are about are missing. So we can hallucinate tables, see patches of water where there is nothing but a stretch of highway, and there is no externalist bar to having these perceptual contents reported as "This table is round" or "That's water ahead." One consequence of this is that my opposition to Cartesianism is on much more general grounds. Allowing the Cartesian intuition that in par- ticular cases of hallucination, hallucinators and veridical perceivers share contents, I nevertheless reject Cartesianism because I deny that these par- 218</page><page sequence="29">ticular cases can be generalized. This fact along with the fact of the indirect way external causality enters content allows me to say that, in particular cases of hallucination, contents may still be attributed along externalist lines. Evans' externalism repudiates Cartesianism much more brutally and straightforwardly because it denies even the initial intuition that there are shared thoughts. Yet psychology, however anti-Cartesian a discipline it is, still operates with that intuition and if an externalist view of content can accommodate the intuition, there is no reason that it should opt for something more radical. The externalism I favor thus stands distinguished from yet another externalism.36 VI I have tried to motivate, sketch and justify against opposition and al- ternatives, an externalist account of content which can plead innocent to the charge of contaminating propositional attitudes for their role in psy- chological explanation. In short, it is an externalist position of psycho- logical content, just what one would want from a unified conception of intentional states. I have done this by claiming distinction for my externalism from at least three others. The first of these stressed the social and linguistic norms of the community external to the agent. I conceded that these would certainly contaminate the psychological role of intentional states if they had to be seen as constitutive of content, but denied that they had to. The second, like the externalism I favor, stressed external causal constitutive elements, but did so (in both its causal-referential and information-theoretic versions) without the proper constraints on these elements, thereby also allowing contamination. Finally, I discussed an externalism motivated by an op- position to Cartesian internalism. Though impeccably motivated, this ex- ternalism unecessarily denied intuitive ideas we have about the nature of thought and psychological content. If one wished to retain our ordinary, intuitive ideas of what goes into psychological explanation, these exter- nalisms would all force a bifurcation of content. In the course of distancing myself from these externalisms I have in- directly also tried to offer diagnoses for why so many philosophers have sought out these more contaminating external determinations of content. Or to put it slightly differently - in reverse order - I have tried to diagnose why, having left out external elements from psychological con- tent, so many philosophers have nevertheless thought it necessary to in- 219</page><page sequence="30">traduce into content, at a later stage (i.e., after psychology is in place) these external elements that I am opposing. It may be worth summarizing this since they were not always raised explicitly in the text as diagnoses of this kind. Some have introduced them, as we saw, in order to account for the social and normative character of language. Others - like Fodor - have introduced these external elements on the grounds that it would make for an anti-realism about intentional states not to do so. Others yet have thought them necessary to provide anchors for our concepts so as to prevent all theory-change from becoming meaning-change. I have had something to say about all three of these motivations in sections, II, III and IV respectively. I have also discussed Evans' motivation for his ex- ternalism (though it doesn't fit, in his own view, into this bifurcated picture) in section V. There is yet another motivation which arises only implicitly in the last section. There are those who introduce these external elements in order to recover the world, having arranged to forget it while doing psychology. They argue, for instance, that their externalist notion of content ('wide' content, as they have called it) must be brought in to explain (a) why our beliefs are reliable and convey reliable information, or (b) why it is that our actions turn out to meet with considerable success in the world. If my line of thought in the last section is sound, such motivations for these externalisms are either beside the point or will not be achieved by these externalism's. In my line of thought, the fact that we are conveyors of more or less reliable information emerges in the very first stage, that of psychological explanation. I don't think we need ever get into the position of having to say that externalist content should pull its weight in this way after the fact of (or independent of the fact of) psychological explanation. The externalism I promoted makes it possible, if I'm right, that the very things which capture agents' conceptions and inferential role, because these cannot, by and large, be misconceptions, will make agents conveyors of more or less objective and determinate information. And finally to the related matter of explaining the success of our actions in coping with the world around us - if one is not moved by what I said about how reliability is achieved right at the first stage of psychological content, then this skepticism can simply dig its heels in and insist that what is thought to be success (the further explanandum) is itself merely an illusion. So either, assuming the skepticism to be false one could (adopting the right exter- nalism) ensure reliability and success at the first psychological level, or rigorously entertaining the skepticism, deny the explananda for a later level 220</page><page sequence="31">of content to service. If I am right the unity of the propositional attitudes is quite unthreatened by the arguments against it and it is only if we embrace a highly implausible epistemological scenario that the question is a serious one. Hence, ulti- mately the source of the unity lies in the connections between philosophy of mind and language on the one hand, and fundamental concerns in epistemology on the other.37 Let me conclude by supplementing these more distant epistemological sources for the unified conception of content with more immediate grounds. I had promised, in section I, to say why I thought appealing to external causes was the most natural way of meeting the publicness constraint on meaning and content. One way of bringing this out is by thinking of an alternative way of meeting it that is found among certain versions of a functionalist conception of the mind. In this functionalist picture the inputs will be peripheral stimuli and the outputs bodily motions. The mediating inner states will not be states of awareness, and whatever content they are given will at most be syntactically characterized and these states will be realized in the states of the central nervous system. This is a thoroughly internalist picture, but such an internalist would find my pursuit of anti- Cartesianism over-scrupulous and besides the point on the grounds that he is, anyway, prepared to accept the public discoverability of meaning, and would never to begin with have taken the Cartesian (or the closely related traditional empiricist) version of internalism to be the best version. Stress- ing a more strictly naturalist empiricism than is found in the tradition, internalism may be characterized along the lines just sketched (thus block- ing my attempt to save the unified conception along externalist lines). And of course since peripheral stimuli and so on are perfectly public items, it would meet what we are assuming to be a necessary constraint on content. About such an internalism there is of course plenty to say. It may however be enough to say just one thing: that in appealing to peripheral stimuli (rather than distal causes of content) it appeals to something not at all natural (even if naturalist) in ascribing beliefs to a person in the context of making sense of him. When one wants one's meanings or thoughts to be understood, one as it were makes them available to another. And another, in making sense of one, avails of the very things that one offers. What is available and availed of in this process (apart from the physical sounds and marks and other bodily motions one produces, which are clearly not enough) can only be a shared public world and not the peripheries and interiors of our bodies. That is why I said that it would be the most natural 221</page><page sequence="32">way to satisfy the publicness requirement, to fix the contents of our beliefs by looking to the external causes. While the subject is common-sense psychological explanation, the appeal to any more internal causes would, even though it is an appeal to something public in the way peripheral stimuli are, fail to display what is manifestly and most naturally in play in the process of communication and understanding. The challenge that this paper has tried to face is to fashion a notion of content that reconciles the external elements forced by this sort of public- ness constraint and by a plausible epistemology with the psychological elements forced by the demand that states with such content are there to explain behavior.38 NOTES 1. In a while, I will have something to say about why thinking of the inefficacy of such content in explanation as stemming from their specifications in that-clauses is not to get to the real source of the alleged inefficacy. But for now let me proceed as if it is so. 2. Though there are several philosophers who subscribe to this view, it has most explicitly and elaborately been argued in recent years by Jerry Fodor. See Chapter 2 of his Psychosemantics (forthcoming, M.I.T. Press). For a view which promotes bifurcation on grounds having to do, not with hopes for a scientific psychology, but with the intuitive attractiveness of supervenience, see Stephen White, ''Partial Character and the Language of Thought," Pacific Philosophical Quarterly , Vol 63 (1982). 3. Brian Loar, "Social Content and Psychological Content" in D. Merrill &amp; Grimm (eds.), Contents of Thought, University of Arizona Press (forthcoming). Kripke's puzzle itself can be found in Saul Kripke, "A Puzzle About Belief," in A. Margalit (ed.), Meaning and Use , D. Reidel (1979). 4. I am assuming here that one can move from the things Pierre says or is disposed to say to attributions of that-clause content to his beliefs for all the reasons Kripke advances in his discussion. 5. In recent work (see especially Psychosemantics , Chapter 3, and his unpublished "Is Content What That Clauses Pick Out?") Fodor argues that it is possible to resolve Kripke's puzzle (and Frege's puzzle about identity) by accounting for the failure of the inferences, not by introducing two belief-contents as above, but by merely pointing to a difference in causal role, a difference that does not have to have anything to do with content at all. This suggestion is an extremely interesting one. It turns out that his opposition to the idea of resolution via content in such cases turns on an opposition to the holism about content (and meaning) that that would entail. And holism, in turn, is opposed on the ground that it would destroy a realism about intentional states and also the possibility of producing genuinely scientific generalizations in psychology. I have already said that I will not address the very last theme. It is impossible also to address the matter of holism and realism in this discussion, but it's hard to resist a brief comment. To the question: can one be a realist and a holist at the same time, the answer seems to me to be: yes. David Lewis in various papers and Brian Loar in his book Mind and Meaning , Cambridge University Press (1981), have surely demonstrated that that com- bination of views, whether one finds it attractive or not, is perfectly possible. (I would 222</page><page sequence="33">even add various essays by Donald Davidson, and Christopher Peacocke's Holistic Explanation , Oxford University Press (1980), among others, to this list, though I can see that since they, unlike Lewis and Loar, are anti-reductionist, the commitment to a genuine realism might be questionable to some. But here again, 1 think the assumption that only reductionists can be realist is worth scrutinizing.) Fodor's more positive reasons for thinking that causal role will be sufficient to account for the failure of some of Pierre's beliefs about London to interact with his other beliefs about London presuppose that the causal role of beliefs in mental processing is sensitive to how it specifies their objects. It is a serious question, however, whether such a notion of causal role, which presupposes sensitivity to something like modes of presentation in order to get out of such puzzles, can be individuated without bringing in an agent's conceptions of the world. I would think it very unlikely that it can and therefore wonder if Fodor's view will not surreptitiously have to appeal to something like content after all. 6. It is a curious fact about Bürge' s refusal to give up on the explanatory role of that-clause content (see his 4 'Individualism and Psychology" Philosophical Review vol. XCV (1986)) that almost the entire discussion of the nature of psychological explanation concentrates not specifically on the social character of the explanans and explananda, but in a general way on their external constitution. How much this is a departure form the specific claims made by him in "Individualism and the Mental," Midwest Studies in Philosophy , vol. IV (1979) about the social constitution of content is a question worth raising. 7. For a very explicit discussion of how Bürge' s views about the social element force a bifurcation of content, see Brian Loar in the paper already cited. He is joined in this by several others. 8. The Freudian cases and those like them are, of course, exceptions in any case, i.e., independent of the matters being discussed here. The Burgean examples, moreover, will be much more widespread than the Freudian cases since the sort of problem Bert has with arthritis can be rather common. For an explicit rejection of the assumption that we by and large know what we believe see John McDowell's preface to J. McDowell and P. Pettit (eds.), Subject, Thought and Context , Oxford University Press (1987). Whether the assumption is legitimate or a mere prejudice is a question I cannot fully address here. I raise the threat to it as a prima facie problem for the unified notion of content. Prima facie, it seems to me, that our intuition that we by and large know what we believe is unsettleable by cases of self-deception and other such cases. It is not clear that it can be unsettled or should be unsettled by a general philosophical stance (such as Bürge 's) on the nature of content. Prima facie, ordinary psychological explanation of an agent's behavior is, intuitively, about behavior described as the agent would recognize it. Here again, cases like self-deception might throw up exceptions. But the far more widespread exceptions (indeed, quite possibly ignorance of one's actions would become the rule) forced by Bürge seems to fly in the face of our intuition about what ordinary psychology is interested in. To give up such intuitions requires very well-motivated and compelling philosophical grounds. I am arguing that these are missing in the Burgean position. Donald Davidson has discussed the question of first person authority at length in two papers: "First Person Authority," Dialéctica , vol. 38 (1984) and "Knowing One's Own Mind," Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association vol. 60 (1987). 9. I have not had the chance to read Bürge' s very recent paper "Intellectual Norms and Foundations of Mind" before writing this paper and would have liked to have seen how the position I take here withstands his discussion of normativity there. 223</page><page sequence="34">10. See Brian Loar, "A New Kind of Content: Comments on Bilgrami" in D. Merrill &amp; R. Grimm (eds.), op. cit. 11. For an example of how everyday reports can be misleading see Donald Davidson's "Knowing One's Own Mind," op. cit. 12. In various papers, but see especially his 4 'The Meaning of 'Meaning,' in his Philo- sophical Papers Vol. II: Mind, Language and Reality , Cambridge University Press (1975). 13. There is more on this in the next section. 14. This is not to suggest that we could not attribute any beliefs or meanings to Robinson Crusoe. The point is merely that where agents rely on others that must be woven into the concepts and contents attributed to them. 15. It goes without saying that to exploit Quine to make this point, one need not accept all the details of the restrictive situation of 'radical translation' that he insists upon. 16. Philosophers as diverse as Kripke, Dretske, Fodor and Davidson have all stressed this element, undoubtedly with diverging motives. 17. The matter of what makes for the difference, if anything does, between Kripke' s and Frege 's puzzles is a delicate one which I cannot take up here. For some discussion of it see Jerry Fodor' s "Is Content What That-Clauses Pick Out?," op. cit. 18. Hartry Field, "Tarski's Theory of Truth," Journal of Philosophy , vol. 69 (1972). 19. There will, no doubt, be those who will even quarrel with my right to use the word "external" once my constraints are applied. These quarrels have probably existed since the time of Kant and I have no desire to add another blow. It would have been enough to sketch the position which seems to me the only plausible one on the issue of the unity of content and let others choose the labels they cherish to describe or name it. (However, see my qualification at the end of Section IV.) 20. The locus classicus is, of course, Kripke' s Naming and Necessity. A determined and thorough effort to elaborate on the remarks in Kripke may be found in Michael Devitt, Designation , Columbia University Press (1981). 21. I'm not suggesting that Dretske or Fodor or Stampe see the difficulty, or want to repair it. Their motivations for their external causal accounts are wholly different and they are probably happy to accept bifurcation. My point here is merely that one cannot exploit their conception of the external causality and retain the psychological element at the same time. Dretske's account is spelled out in his Knowledge and the Flow of Information, M.I.T. Press (1981). See also Jerry Fodor, Psychosemantics , Chapter 3 and D. Stampe, "Towards a Causal Theory of Linguistic Representation," Midwest Studies in Philos- ophy , vol. II (1977). 22. Fodor favors working with representations in the head but the question he raises can be discussed without taking that view. 23. Fodor, Psychosemantics , Chapter 2. 24. This method, which appeals to what goes into attribution of concepts in order to make clear the external elements determining content, is the method of radical interpretation. See, for instance, Donald Davidson, "Radical Interpretation" in his Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation , Oxford University Press (1981). The constraint appealing to an agent's other beliefs is an echo of the version of the principle of charity first made explicit by Richard Grandy in ' 'Reference, Meaning and Belief, ' ' Journal of Philosophy , vol. 71 (1973), but already implicit in Davidson, a version which asks the method to minimize unexplained error or disagreement rather than to maximize agreement. A principle that sought merely to maximize agreement would inevitably attribute contents that failed to capture agents' conceptions of things. Here I am adapting the principle of charity to constrain our description of external causes. 224</page><page sequence="35">25. Apart from its relevance to Evans' view, this two-stage process prevents one from getting into the intractable difficulties that Fodor and Dretske find themselves with when they have to account for the possibility of having erroneous beliefs. The issue is not unrelated to Evans' views as will be obvious when I discuss hallucinations in section V. 26. John McDowell, who along with Gareth Evans first introduced such theories to capture Fregean senses, is hostile to the idea that they capture agents' tacit knowledge. For him that idea smacks of psychologism. I'm not sure I see what the big issue is here but if one can get by without saying that in the theory of content, so much the better. See J. McDowell, "On the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name Mind," 86 (1977), 159- 185. 27. This is not to be confused with the idea of bifurcated content. 28. The difference between the Davidsonian anchors and the others I've criticized earlier is that in the former they are provided by truth-conditions fixed by the interpreter's lights and in the latter they are fixed by purported facts outside of interpretation altogether. But they both have anchors, something missing in my account which formulates truth- and reference-conditions as agents conceive them. All the following remarks I make in defence of my formulation against Davidson's should apply - with bells on - to the other theories claiming these advantages on the subject of theory- vs. meaning-change. 29. See Putnam's "The Meaning of Meaning,' " which is also the first place where the twin-earth example was raised. 30. Two points. First: It is interesting that Davidson who is an externalist but (because of his commitment to interpretation) not guilty of some highly realist, belief-independent conception of natural kinds, nevertheless advises against treating contents as shared by twin-agents in such cases. This again flows from his suspicion of a theoretical enterprise bent on capturing agents' conceptions of things. And again, the response must be that if we can capture these without abandoning the externalism, why not produce the tax- onomy with finer grain? Second: In his "A New Kind of Content," Loar scolds me for leaving out the social element from the externalism and fastening on a purely non-social causal element. He says I'm committed to a metaphysically dubious notion of natural kinds, such as the natural kind dog or water or ... unmediated by social norms and conventions of usage. The charge is based on a misunderstanding. Kinds fall out, for me, in the project of making sense of a person by producing a theory meeting certain constraints. It is question-begging against the considerations I raise in section II, to say that the only way out of the metaphysically dubious conception is to think of natural kinds as socially mediated in the Burgean sense he favors. 31. See his "Reference and Understanding" in Meaning and the Moral Sciences , Routledge Kegan Paul (1978). 32. See his "Social Content and Psychological Content." 33. See his "Beyond Belief," in A. Woodfield A. (ed.), Thought and Object , Clarendon Press (1982). 34. See Gareth Evans, "Comments on Fodor's "Methodological Solipsism as a Research Strategy" in his Collected Papers , Clarendon Press (1986). The quotations from Evans which follow are from here. See also John McDowell, "Singular Thought and the Extent of Inner Space" in McDowell and Pettit, op. cit. 35. The dispute here should not be trivialized by making Evans' position right via a stipu- lation, i.e., by defining singular thoughts in terms of the existence of the relevant objects and then denying that there is a shared singular thought in the hallucinatory and veridical cases. Someone might just as easily deny the stipulation and instead define such thoughts in terms of the presence of singular terms in the sentences used to express them. This terminological issue is not what is important. 225</page><page sequence="36">36. If space had allowed, I would have liked to have discussed Evans' and McDowell's views at greater length and looked into other motivations they have for them over and above the anti-Cartesian motives. These other motives have to do with giving a satis- factory account of demonstratives. Thus my criticism can take a conditional form: While anti-Cartesianism is the motive, nothing as strong as their externalism is required to achieve it. I should also add that it is important, despite my common opposition to Evans' externalism and the other causal externalisms 1 discussed in section III to point out that Evans' views differ sharply from those others. Evans and McDowell, unlike those others, are at pains to see their views as a version of Frege' s notion of thought and sense, albeit not the version of traditional Frege interpretation. Their view has an element of the de re, but nevertheless these are de re senses. 37. Among the few philosophers who have explicitly and in detail recognized that these issues about content are caught up in very basic epistemologica! concerns, are Tyler Bürge, "Cartesian Error and the Objectivity of Perception," in J. McDowell and P. Pettit, op. cit., John McDowell, "Singular Thought and the Extent of Inner Space" and Christopher Peacocke, Thoughts: An Essay on Content , Basil Blackwell (1985). All of them take positions on the nature of these connections which are very different from mine. 38. This paper elaborates on ideas presented somewhat obscurely and with far too much compression in my contribution to the Oberlin Colloquium on Contents of Thought in April 1985 which is published in a volume with that title and cited earlier. I owe special and renewed thanks to Donald Davidson and Carol Rovane for reading that version and providing comments which have been invaluable in writing this one. The intellectual debt to Donald Davidson's work should be apparent to most readers. My thanks also to Isaac Levi with whom I have had several interesting conversations on the subject of this paper which have opened my eyes to implications of the very general stance I took in the earlier version. I have also benefited from Brian Loar' s reply to my Comment at the Oberlin Collo- quium and Barry Loewer's Comment on a version of this paper given at the American Philosophical Association meetings in Boston, December 1986. 226</page></plain_text>
