<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paleobiology, 5(3), 1979, pp. 337-352 Evolving paleontological views on deterministic and stochastic approaches Thomas J. M. Schopf Abstract.-Experienced workers in a field are unlikely to change their assessment of basic philosophical issues. Einstein for example never accepted the indeterminacy required by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, despite the urgings of Max Born and virtually all others. Similarly even earlier, some older workers had refused to accept the young Einstein's theories. Now if issues in physics are not open and shut, they are even less so in paleontology. Possibly it is useful to probe the underlying basic philo- sophical background to our discipline. The purpose of the present article is to indicate that the inductive, deterministic approaches which have been used almost exclusively in paleontology have stringent limi- tations. For some types of problems, deductive stochastic processes are more interesting. If we can make the distinction of 'few' versus 'many,' then it is quite easy to consider deterministic explanations for the individual cases (the movement of individual molecules) but to reserve stochastic explanations for the ensembles of events (the movement of molecules too numerous to count).

In more complex cases we find that a variety of different events may occur un- der conditions which are experimentally kept as constant as possible. This is true even of a rel- atively simple process like Brownian movement. R. S. Lillie, 1932 Introduction Stated in modern terms, the question of whether events in the natural world can be at- tributed to a single deterministic cause, or whether they are merely one possible outcome of a stochastic universe, is of long-standing in- terest. Just the month in which I write this es- say, Einstein is quoted at length in this the cen- tenary of his birth. He said, "What I'm really interested in is whether God could have made the world in a different way; that is, whether the necessity of logical simplicity leaves any freedom at all." It is well known on which side of the fence Einstein himself felt most comfort- ? 1979 The Paleontological Society.

But that, there should be sta- tistical laws with definite solutions, i.e., laws which compel the Good Lord to throw the dice in each individual case, I find highly disagree- able." (Both quotations in Brecher 1979). The purpose of this present article is to sup- port the view that chance (and its statistical coun- terpart when large numbers of chances are in- volved, namely stochastic processes) forms the first-order pattern of organization for the history of life. By chance, I do not mean that things hap- pen without cause-only that the causes (1) are in an operational sense so multifaceted and com- plex that events happen as though by chance and (2) are not destined to give the same re- sult in every trial. It is hoped that readers will not stop at this point for it is further argued that superimposed on this stochastic pattern are many, retrospective second-order deterministic explanations for why a given event occurred. I hope to show that it is the peculiarity-and bias-of a retrospective viewpoint which has led paleontology to overlook the role of chance. As we look back on history, events seem to have been predetermined. If so, then one immediate- 0094-83 73/79/0503-0009/$ 1.00</page><page sequence="2">338 THOMAS J. M. SCHOPF ly moves to a deterministic explanation. Only recently have paleontologists sought to redress this imbalance. Whig History When the English historian Herbert Butter- field published "The Whig Interpretation of His- tory" in 1931, he was recalling that the Whigs were the nineteenth century predecessors of the successful Liberal Party. The Whigs gained in- creased respectability and fame not merely be- cause of their own efforts but because of the suc- cess decades later of their intellectual descendants. What Butterfield brilliantly argued was that the judgment of an event decades after it occurred was utterly the wrong way to write history. In- stead, issues of the past are just that-in the past-and must be seen in light of judgments of that world, not of ours today. As an example, Butterfield wrote, "It may be true to assert that there are many things in history and in the pres- ent day which would never have happened in the way they have happened if Martin Luther had not defied a Pope; there are equally many things which would not have taken place as they have done if Columbus had not discovered America; but it is as fallacious to ascribe pater- nity to Luther in the one case as it is to make Columbus responsible for modern America; we can only say that both men added a condition- ing circumstance to a whole network of other conditioning circumstances more than four cen- turies ago" (p. 38). As a consequence of the traditional view, one was led as Butterfield noted "to praise revolu- tions as long as they were successful" (p. 9). The success of a winner then led naturally to dis- cussions about how it had been "inevitable," as one sought the "key factor" which led to its suc- cess. In contrast to this historical determinism, Butterfield concluded that "Perhaps the greatest of all the lessons of history is this demonstration of the complexity of human change and the un- predictable character of the ultimate conse- quences of any given act or decision of man" (p. 24). [As a relevant aside, I could mention the es- tablishment of this journal. I would agree wholeheartedly with the viewpoint of Butter- field that, judged in terms of the times it was being discussed, its establishment (if at all!), and its subsequent development, were far from in- evitable. As the meetings in which the decision was made to proceed, those opposed cited the poor financial position of the Society, the dismal state of the stock market ("Did you see what happened to Chrysler today," one asked), the possible injury to the Journal of Paleontology, etc. One independent estimate had Paleobiology costing the Paleontological Society some tens of thousands of dollars as it repeatedly borrowed to stay afloat. (Three years after its inception I could report that not only had Paleobiology paid its own bills from normal journal income, but it had even "repaid" the Society the $5,000 ini- tially advanced to begin the journal!) There was certainly nothing at all inevitable about the de- cision to proceed. And there was no guarantee that enough subscribers would be forthcoming. Yet I wager that despite these words, some his- torian of paleontology a decade or so in the fu- ture will somehow say that "the time had come and the journal was inevitable." For those who were there, nothing could be further from the truth. ] Whig history, then, is based on "an assump- tion which overlooks the fact that history is the whole network produced by countless compli- cations perpetually involving one another" (Butterfield 1931, p. 75). And further, as a con- sequence, "The Whig historian thinks that the source of history, the passage of centuries can give judgement on a man or an age or a move- ment" (p. 66). In the present context of paleon- tology as history, I hope to make plausible the view that Whig values are not limited to human history but are found in a pervasive way in in- terpretations of the history of life. Paleontological History The purpose of this section is to characterize what has been one of the pervading attitudes toward data of evolutionary paleontology, namely an emphasis on anthropocentric inter- pretations. Many citations from the literature are possible and I have limited myself to three books to make the point. Knipe's Evolution in the Past (1912) put the question of mammalian "success" very clearly when he wrote about the Eocene: "Mammal</page><page sequence="3">PROGRESS IN PALEONTOLOGY 339 life, now triumphant, was represented by forms far surpassing in variety and importance the primitive creatures known in earlier times. The predominance of mammal over reptile life can hardly have been obtained by brute force; for there is no reason to suppose that primitive mammals were either warriors or flesh-eaters. Various geographical and climatic changes may have helped to shift the sovereignty; but the su- perior intelligence and higher moral qualities of the mammals were undoubtedly great factors in the dynastic question" (p. 116-117). Not much later, Schuchert (1918, p. 81) re- turned to emphasize the anthropomorphic view that intelligence is the greatest good of all. He wrote, "The greatest mentality in the sea has been repeatedly derived from the continents, first in the fishes, then in the reptiles, and lastly in the mammals, and they have adapted them- selves to the sea because of the ease with which they can there prey upon the less alert and in- telligent. Such adapted stocks in the course of geologic time grow larger and larger, as, for in- stance, the whales of today. Out of them, how- ever, comes no higher mentality. They repre- sent an adaptation in the wrong direction, that is, to an easier life, for the highest organisms with the greatest mentality have been developed only on the land where the struggle for existence is fiercest because of the constant necessity of adaptation to an environment subject to intense changes. Organic supremacy is attained only through constant vigilance" (p. 81). Now to move 30 years ahead to Simpson's Life of the Past, An Introduction to Paleontol- ogy, which reads, "One of the things most clear- ly conducive to progression with survival is in- crease in perception and in the power to react appropriately to what is perceived. Sense or- gans for receiving significant stimruli from the surrounding world become more specific and more effective. Nervous systems that correlate perceptions and that relate them to reactions arise and become more elaborate and more elas- tic. Of all the progressions seen in the history of life this most merits the name of progress, that is, not merely cumulative change but also change for the better. "The culmination of this sort of progress is man." (1953, p. 154; by 1968, the book itself had gone through some 15 printings). These three passages cover several decades and may be sufficient to indicate that for good or bad, true or false, the theme of constant pro- gression culminating in "man" has been a gen- eral conclusion from the study of paleontology. But at this point, one could well imagine But- terfield pointing his finger at this Whig inter- pretation of life of the past. The "winners" are endowed with the traits which we ourselves hold of value. The emphasis is on continual pro- gression, continual improvement, continual ad- aptation and control of one's environment. As the modern British historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote, "Above all, Whig history was the work of an age which believed in progress" (1950, p. 22). The tendency of paleontologists to look more like Whig historians than they should cannot be ascribed to the unavoidable bias in the amount and nature of evidence available to them, as it can be argued applies to historians. Hull (1979) asserted for historical fields of study that by the very act of being successful, more historical rec- ords are left by some governments than others. Thus the emphasis of modern historians on those "successful revolutions" is in part a re- flection on the fact that more simply is known about them, and in that sense more attention should be paid to them. In paleontology, on the other hand, many extinct taxonomic groups have extensive fossil records and yet it appears we still have focused professionally on interpre- tations based on what we perceive as the ben- eficial characters of mammals and of men. Stan- ley (1977, p. 243) for example looks for competition and "vertebrate like" sensory per- ception, etc., to account for the repeated itera- tive evolution of trilobites and ammonites, both of which have been extinct for many millions of years, and which left an enormous fossil record. In contrast to the Whig view, I support the interpretation that there was and is nothing in- evitable about the evolution of Homo sapiens. Do the wars and famines which that species has had, has now and will have show a control over the environment? Is "intelligence" that remark- able? There are aspects of perception highly de- veloped in every species. Even prokaryotic blue- green algae now have been discovered to use chemical secretions when a neighboring species encroaches on their "property." The perceptive New Yorker cartoonist Steinberg may have</page><page sequence="4">340 THOMAS J. M. SCHOPF been close to the truth when he showed a lion communicating to other lions a view of animal evolution-with Felis leo at the top of course. The perspective of the lecturer makes all the difference. And, as a listener to a lecture I gave in Oxford told me later, if man is indeed just one more species on earth, and hardly the in- evitable result of evolution, it makes little sense to mount special emblems and symbols and send these off into space to communicate with the top of the intelligensia of another planet- presumed to be a form with senses very much like Homo sp., of course (witness the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind). In general, there is in evolution both a con- science and an inadvertent overemphasis on humans and their biology in comparison to the multitude of plants and animals about most of which we are quite ignorant. We write about and glorify the fossil record in terms of that which we know best-ourselves-but this is surely the grossest example imaginable of Whig history. From an evolutionary perspective, Homo sapiens in its niche seems no more re- markable than any other species in its niche, no matter how much our religious, cultural and historical traditions support another view. Stripped of this human bias, Homo sapiens is just one more species whose evolution is not to be glorified, nor denigrated, but just accepted for what it is in the same way one would any old familiar condylarth, orchid or crustacean. Scale, Induction and Deduction The matter of scale is of crucial importance in the discussion I now wish to present. Scale determines how one looks for patterns of expla- nation in data. In the macrocosm, there are hundreds of thousands to millions of species, and billions of individuals. In the microcosm, there is the birth, life and death of a single species or individual. The type of explanation appropriate for one scale may be quite inappro- priate for the other scale. To present an analo- gy, an insurance demographer may chart the rise and fall of the population of a city, whereas a physician is concerned with the health of a single individual. The demographer wishes to know the incidence of disease, and the proba- bility of its occurrence, in the population. The clinician, on the other hand, views the occur- rence of symptoms in a single individual from which one then surmises the probability that they are due to this or that specific cause; i.e., the clinician operates with conditional proba- bility. The clinician therefore cannot make gen- eral statements about the population unless one knows that all or almost all of a random sample of the conditioning factor has been seen, a fact which is almost never known. Thus although the approaches used by the demographer and the clinician are both appropriate, the approach which one uses to analyze the data in each in- stance is vastly different-or should be. The traditional paleontological focus on spe- cific events and taxa in geologic history involved individual cases (i.e., the clinician's approach). Most of the articles published in our journals are about the description, distribution, origination, life and demise of particular taxa. Given obser- vations about individual taxa, paleontologists have then proceeded by summing up the individ- ual cases and thereby to achieve by induction a general pattern. There are, however, two major difficulties with focusing on induction for discernment of general paleontological patterns. In the first place, many patterns have thousands (or more) possible examples. Even granting the work of previous generations of paleontologists, only a small number of possible examples can be stud- ied, and of these a few may well be "exceptions." The second difficulty with focusing on induc- tion is that the mode of thought appropriate to explain individual cases-i.e., deterministic ex- planations-is inappropriate to explain large numbers of cases. By determinism I mean that a paleontologist might provide a set of specific conditions which are (1) very likely to have ob- tained, and (2) were sufficient to bring about the event itself. One can specify for the individ- ual case all of the constraints, values of the state variables, etc., and obtain a unique solution. However, when dealing with "thousands" of events, one must allow for stochastic variation in every constraint, etc. This variation may arise because some processes are so complex and multi-faceted that in practice the exact values cannot be specified, and indeed may even be unknowable in principle. Thus for population phenomena one must think in terms of statisti-</page><page sequence="5">PROGRESS IN PALEONTOLOGY 341 cal averages. The appropriate theory for such situations is stochastic theory. Even at the small scale, stochastic elements may be a major controlling outcome of the "ex- periment." And in fact laboratory experiments present perhaps the best place to analyze the role of stochastic processes because ad hoc ex- planations can gradually be omitted as addi- tional experiments are carried out. The work on competition in the flour beetles of the genus Tri- bolium has extended over 30 years. Determi- nacy occurs when the conditions are such that "one species is the invariable winner," and in- determinacy exists when "it may be a matter of probability which species survives the compet- itive process as the other drifts to extinction" (Mertz et al. 1976). Although the initial exper- imental results were almost universally inter- preted in terms of a specific deterministic factor, gradually and finally the fundamental role of ecologic stochasticity as seen in initial popula- tion density came to be appreciated. Mertz et al. (1976) concluded that "In sum, we believe on the basis of empirical evidence, that we have helped to restore the concept of demographic stochasticity to its rightful status as an integral part of population biology" (emphasis theirs). The above remarks refer to two species in a bottle. How much more complex is a natural association of many species in a fluctuating and highly variable environment, both from biotic and abiotic points of view? The phrase "supe- rior competitor" means nothing if it only de- scribes the ultimate "winner" it is a tautology. It may well be that relative to some other species, every species is a "superior competitor" and "more fit." If so, to ascribe major evolu- tionary patterns to "competition" is misleading unless it is put explicitly into a stochastic frame- work. This has now been done for the pattern of colonization of islands (Simberloff 1978) and tree dispersion in the tropics (Hubbell 1979). Hubbell's (1979) conclusion was that patterns of relative species abundance in tropical forests ''are explained by a simple stochastic model based on random-walk immigration and extinc- tion set in motion by periodic community dis- turbance." Simberloffs and Hubbell's papers are extraordinarily important because they pro- vide a crucial link between recognition of the role of disturbance in natural habitats (see e.g., Connell 1978) and the expectations in a sto- chastic world (Osman and Whitlatch 1978). A good example of an inductively derived sta- tistical "law" dating from half a century ago is what might be called Willis' Law. Willis (1922) empirically discovered that the frequency dis- tribution of the number of species per genus for the fauna or flora of a geographic region follows a hollow curve-"hollow" in the sense that there is an "underrepresentation" of genera with a lot of species and thus the curve has a backward "J" shape. Anderson's (1974) excellent analysis of Willis' and later data demonstrated that this pattern of taxonomic diversity is compatible with stochastic assumptions in a branching model of evolution, in sharp contrast to earlier deterministic explanations. The best recent example of an inductively derived "law" in evolutionary paleontology is Van Valen's Law (Raup 1975). Van Valen (1973) began an empirical study on longevity of taxa and realized after plotting data for hundreds of taxa that it appeared as though for any given group, the taxa had a constant prob- ability of extinction. He had not expected this result, and he then extended the data base to include many groups, at several taxonomic levels. He used a stochastic explanation to ac- count for the patterns within major adaptive zones (where tens to hundreds or even thou- sands of items are involved). In contrast to this stochastic view, Foin et al. (1975) asserted that the probability of survival of a group is not the same over geologic time, and also that at any given geologic time the probability of extinction is not the same for all members of a taxon. Hence specific taxa and specific times must be considered. Thus in the instance of Van Valen's Law, there are both stochastic and deterministic "interpretations" of the same basic data. What is unusual about this situation paleontologically is that a stochastic explanation was offered. There is an extraordinarily strong reliance on determinism in paleontology. The antipathy to- ward stochastic processes by those who are con- cerned with geologic history per se and who re- gard the uniqueness of the known fossil record as that which must be explained is well ex- pressed by Thayer (1979). He wrote, "Stochastic explanations have been offered for evolutionary patterns, but why be defeatist when there are</page><page sequence="6">342 THOMAS J. M. SCHOPF credible deterministic alternatives?" Many oth- ers have shared this view. It brings forth a sharp dichotomy in how one perceives the fossil record but utterly confuses the nature of expla- nation in paleontology. The confusion regarding explanation comes about because of the scale of the feature to be explained. By analogy, a physician who figured out the reason why an individual person had died would now-a-days hardly deride a demog- rapher whose business it was to look at sto- chastic variation in health on a population scale. Similarly, to report that an oxygen mol- ecule bounced off two others and that this was the immediate cause of their movement, is hard- ly to deny the value of the gas laws involving millions of molecules and for which the move- ment of any individual molecule is inconse- quential. Determinism at the individual level fails when the questions asked are of a popu- lational nature. A further failing of determinism is that it can- not be used to predict future events. In the bril- liantly written Poverty of Historicism, Popper (1945) demonstrated the inadequacy of viewing social, political and economic history as a set of deterministic events in which the future could have been foretold. In the most obvious case, predictions of economists and of political lead- ers cause a change in future events by the very act of making the prediction-what he called the Oedipus effect. The prediction cannot be separated from the variables and it is therefore quite impossible to predict the course of history except in the most general way. Paradoxically, by the very nature of their fixing a value on all relevant variables, deterministic explanations can only result in a "prediction" for a single particularistic result-and never a general, pop- ulational prediction. Since the relevant values for variables are always or almost always never known for all practical purposes, this is the same thing as saying that deterministic expla- nations can never result in a predictive science. It is worth following a bit further what Pop- per said concerning trends-since paleontolo- gists most often take a trend to be significant- e.g., all of the varieties of evolutionary ortho- genesis. Popper wrote, "But, it will be said, the existence of trends or tendencies in social change can hardly be questioned: every statis- tician can calculate such trends. Are these trends not comparable with Newton's law of inertia? The answer is: trends exist, or more precisely, the assumption of trends is often a useful statistical device. But trends are not laws. A statement asserting the existence of a trend is existential, not universal .... and a statement asserting the existence of a trend at a certain time and place would be a singular historical statement, not a universal law. The practical significance of this logical situation is considerable: while we may base scientific pre- dictions on laws, we cannot (as every cautious statistician knows) base them merely on the ex- istence of trends. A trend (we may again take population growth as an example) which has persisted for hundreds or even thousands of years may change within a decade, or even more rapidly than that" (p. 115, emphasis his). The paleontological counterpart of human history is to take a series of events and to in- dicate how result B came from conditions A. A good recent example, which may well be true, is Thayer's (1979) "bulldozer" hypothesis in which the fact of the existence of sediment dis- turbing taxa is claimed to have determined the course of evolution for marine benthic com- munities. In actual fact, what has been shown is one possible outcome of the circumstance in which sediment movers exerted an influence on surface dwellers. Whether the course of evolu- tion was irrevocably set, and the only conclu- sion which could have eventuated from this condition, cannot be claimed and cannot be told. Were geologic history replayed with the same characters and set of general constraints but with the usual stochastic elements of organ- ism adaptation and climatic and ecologic vari- ation, another specific outcome may have oc- curred. Even Thayer noted that "there are as many possible extinction hypotheses as there are factors controlling the distribution of organ- isms. " The reason why deterministic explanations of the type formulated by Thayer are so attractive to the majority of paleontologists is that our whole training and focus is on specific events, outcrops, collections, taxa, etc.; in short, we are channeled at an early age toward the objects of our profession. We usually let our traditions tell us what is an important problem rather than</page><page sequence="7">PROGRESS IN PALEONTOLOGY 343 seek the important problems in our profession from first principles. We are like historians put forth into the world to say in retrospect why it was that national socialism came to rise in Ger- many, or that the Russian Revolution succeed- ed, or that brachiopods declined and bivalves expanded. Moreover we are culturally as a peo- ple programmed to see inevitability in history, as was made clear by Francis FitzGerald's (1979) fascinating analysis of American history books. Yet it is not at all obvious, as many histo- rians admit, what would have happened in Ger- many or in Russia if matters had been only slightly different at a dozen different times. And our record of these very recent events is ever so much more comprehensive than is our record of the "life and hard times" (Raup 1979) of bra- chiopods and bivalves. In summary of this section, both deterministic and stochastic approaches are useful in paleon- tology-but for accounting for different types of events. Our training constrains most paleonto- logists to think solely in terms of inductive gen- eralizations, and this leads to a deterministic interpretation of events which is often a plau- sible, but not a necessary conclusion. In con- trast to our training, the proper type of theory to apply to large statistical summaries is some form or another of stochastic theory, such as occurs in chemistry (the gas laws), population biology (demography), and physics (the Heisen- berg uncertainty principle). The fate of any giv- en molecule, or individual animal, or atom is of no concern per se. Rather, the ensemble statis- tical properties of the particles and the types of predictions which those properties allow are what is of interest. Lest some authors become concerned, this does not diminish the question of how and why bivalves evolved as they did, just as, in history, one is legitimately concerned with how and why Russia came to have its dic- tatorship and England did not. But this appeal for the incorporation of stochastic thinking into paleontology does say that there was nothing inevitable either in evolution or in history that a priori determined either the present state of affairs, or any specific past configuration. Rates of Evolution No topic in paleontology is so tied both to popular and to professional judgment as is the Shifting Trends In Perceived Rates Of Evolution A 1950 Number f of Taxa Living Bivalves Manmmals Hawaiian Fossils ..- Factor of Io -- Drosophilidae Dif ference in rate of - Factor ofa 1000 , evolution B. 2050 Factor of 100 C.

(C) Hypothetical stage to show presumed true rates of evolution if all biases could be removed. perceived rate of evolution. The pervasive view since World War II is that vastly different rates (factor of 10) occur between major taxa (mam- mals versus bivalves). And these are not the extremes (Figure 1). Even more striking is a comparison of the tails of the distribution. Out at the rapid end of the spectrum are the Hawai- ian Drosophilidae and the African rift lake cich- lid fishes each with their swarms of sibling species. The Hawaiian fruit flies include on the order of 10i species which have evolved in ap- proximately 10 Myr [5 Myr if one takes the Hawaiian Islands themselves, 20 Myr if one al- lows for an initial start at Midway Island (Car- son and Kaneshiro 1976; L. H. Throckmorton 1979, personal communication)]. At the slow end are the "living fossils" which, to quote the conventional view as developed and popularized by Simpson (1953 and else- where), is that "There are a number of animals living today that have changed very little for very long periods of time: a little brachiopod called Lingula, in some 400 million years; Lim- ulus, the horseshoe 'crab'-really more of a scorpion than a crab-in 175 million or more; Sphenodon, a lizard-like reptile now confined to New Zealand, in about 150 million years; Didelphis, the American opossum, in a good 75 million years. These and the other animals for which evolution essentially stopped long ago all</page><page sequence="8">344 THOMAS J. M. SCHOPF have relatives that evolved at usual or even at relatively fast rates" (p. 138). Simpson's view mirrored and created conven- tional wisdom on this topic and has had a very wide impact. Two decades later, the well- known "neutralist" proponents Kimura and Ohta in their article "On some principles gov- erning molecular evolution" (1974) reported that "Although local fluctuations no doubt occur, constancy rather than variation of the evolu- tionary rate distinguishes the process of molec- ular evolution." And then, citing Simpson, con- tinue, "This is particularly noteworthy since it is well-known that there are enormous differ- ences among evolutionary rates at the organism level; some forms have evolved very rapidly while others have stayed essentially unchanged over hundreds of millions of years (especially in organisms known as living fossils)." The view that "living fossils" are organisms in which, as Simpson described, "evolution es- sentially stopped long ago" arises from one as- sumption. This assumption is that speciation is reflected accurately in the remains of an organ- ism as preserved in geologic strata. That is to say, a literal reading of the objects which com- prise our fossil record is assured to reflect a "true" image of a previous reality. I wish now to dis- cuss this philosophical assumption. A general consensus of rates of evolution for different taxa might be as shown in Figure 1A. By evolution, I agree with most authors that one is chiefly concerned about the process of speciation per se. The question is, How does one recognize speciation? Humans can hardly dis- tinguish sibling species of Drosophila even though the flies themselves have no problem. Aside from "color and shape taxa" in, e.g., landsnails, the general pattern of the systematic literature seems to be that a group is subdivided into more and more species with the advent of each new method of analysis. Although exam- ples exist from protozoa to salamanders, I cite those from only one phylum-Bryozoa, which I know best. New characters are revealed by thin sections (Boardman and Utgaard 1964), scanning electron microscopy (Soule and Soule 1973, 1974), chromosomal analysis (Potter 1979; White 1977, 1978), and most recently gel electropho- resis (Thorpe et al. 1978; Avise 1974). These new characters are often assigned major syste- matic importance. Yet the "Truth" of any given biological species should not be dependent upon the technological accident of what instrument is brought to bear on the taxon. But in practice the extent of technological study has been, is now, and will continue to be a basic factor in how rates of evolution are perceived. Therefore I feel is it justified to ask where does the trend lead us? As fossil groups are studied more and more, it appears to me that, as an operational matter, finer and finer taxonomic subdivisions are made and that because of this, on the average, their geographic and ecologic ranges are shortened, the "rate of evolution" is quickened, and none of this through anything the organisms themselved did. Nowhere has the illusion of the "living fos- sil" been more patently exposed than in the case of Limulus, the horseshoe crab. The enormously abundant living species L. polyphemus is seemingly not known from a single fossil speci- men, and the family Limulidae to which the ge- nus Limulus belongs is not known beyond the Miocene (St0rmer 1955). Further, excellent fun- damental morphologic analysis has now revealed that among those specimens with the general Limulus-like tripartate division of fused cepha- lon-thorax, abdomen, and long terminal spike, that there are quite distinct physical capabilities for swimming, walking and burrowing (Fisher 1977, p. 199; personal communication 1977). And to take another group, for long-ranging bryozoans, Buge (1972, p. 56) wrote that the number of long-lived taxa "diminishes in propor- tion to the increase in our knowledge and as the possibility increases for distinguishing a different species those which former authors saw only as one form with a great persistence." Schopf (1977) reviews other bryozoan examples of sup- posed living fossils. More generally. T. Wayland Vaughan remarked in his 1923 presidential ad- dress to the Paleontological Society that "Dis- crimination between species, so called, is now much finer than in the days of Lyell and De- shayes, and now about the same percentage of Recent species is recognized in deposits of older Miocene age (Langhian) that Lyell considered characteristic of the Eocene" (Vaughan, 1924: 685). As species ranges are shortened, the per- centage of fossil species extending to the Recent declines. The trend of these practices of shortening</page><page sequence="9">PROGRESS IN PALEONTOLOGY 345 the geologic ranges of species (and thus in- creasing the rate of de facto speciation) leads to the situation shown in Figure 1C in which speciation rates converge at the "fast" end of the spectrum. What I wish to emphasize is that it is a historical accident that we are studying speciation in 1979-and not in 1879 when taxa had longer stratigraphic ranges-nor in 2079 when we may anticipate that we may come as close to knowing true rates of speciation as the technology is capable of permitting. The view that rates of evolution are com- plexity dependent is hardly new. T. Wayland Vaughan wrote 50 years ago that "It has been pointed out by many paleontologists that the more complex the structural features of an or- ganism are, the more restricted will be its strati- graphic range. This is the principle that under- lies the high value of mammals for correlation purposes. The range of species of mollusks, brachiopods, and other organisms that possess surface sculpture will be inversely proportional to the degree and complexity of the surface ornamentation; and the value of the larger Foraminifera, such as Discocylina, Asteriacites and Lepidocyclina, in the identification of strati- graphic horizons is a result of complex, mostly internal, structure" (Vaughan, 1924:687). The technological advances simply allow for the in- creased perception of complexity. This is not to imply that species are merely figments of technology. I firmly believe that bio- logic species are real entities in the sense that at any given place and time, individuals are grouped by ecological factors into local popula- tions, and that these populations have a large degree of genetic relatedness to other local popu- lations, and the whole ensemble of populations has a limited spatial, temporal and ecologic distribution. This is to imply that our recog- nition of these species is often dependent on technology. I would like to offer an additional ecologic reason why we should anticipate that rates of speciation should be close to the very rapid end of the scale. The tropics today are characterized by a large number of species and a large amount of co-evolution. Yet both rain forests and coral belts seem to have varied enormously in size over periods of a few thousand years. For rain forests, Shackleton (1977) synthesized the data on their Pleistocene areal coverage. He found that rain forests have varied from twice their present coverage (during pluvial times) to only one-third their present size (during arid times)- a factor of 6. This must certainly have been accompanied by an immense amount of both extinction and speciation (Simpson 1975)-little of which could be expected to have left a rea- sonable fossil record. In the sea, similar considerable Pleistocene changes occurred when sea level changed by approximately 200 m over 20,000 yr. Reefs built out at times such as we have had for the past 4,000 yr when sea level has been almost uni- form. In contrast during periods of rapid sea level lowering, reefs must have been very con- tracted which would explain why continental shelves of the tropics are not one continuous coral reef. Extensive speciation accompanied rising sea level (several examples summarized by Schopf and Murphy 1973), and extinction probably followed during lowering of sea level. Most of this change in diversity occurred in taxa which could leave no fossil record, and, in any event, sedimentation has preserved a very poor Pleistocene record on continental shelves. In summary of this section, a literal reading of the fossil record gives, I believe, a grossly distorted view of rates of evolution. Modern comprehension of speciation combined with the information on profound ecologic changes over geologically short periods of time lead to the conclusion that rates of speciation are very rap- id-often on the order of a few thousand years, at most. If so, the changes which paleontologists call speciation events, are largely some higher order evolutionary change, perhaps at the "ge- neric" level. Extinction Many deterministic explanations of origina- tion and of extinction are based on how one applies "fitness" to a given species. The plau- sibility of this explanation is due partly to the present mental attitude which a paleontolo- gist-or any historian-brings to a retrospective discipline. One wants to figure out why group A made it, and group B did not. In the discus- sions of the major extinctions, the assertion is made, retrospectively, that the reason group B</page><page sequence="10">346 THOMAS J. M. SCHOPF became extinct was that it was "less fit" (but this is by definition!). It is a tautology to write that "organisms lose adaptation, usually be- cause their populations do not adapt to changes" (Simpson 1953, p. 138). A non-tautological ac- count would include the possibility for less fit and ill-adapted taxa to persist, or alternatively one could develop other criteria (than survival) for "fitness." Because of the reliance on tauto- logical definitions, the concepts of "fitness" and of "adaptation" at present seem to be virtually meaningless in terms of understanding extinc- tion. Deterministic explanations of extinction of taxa characteristically involve the bias of the special case: one focuses on one or a small num- ber of taxa, and those forms which didn't make it are then afforded special explanations. Let us consider the following analogy which involves the extinction of a single person. Of all the per- sons driving a car at 4:00 p.m. on a Sunday, why did driver X crash with driver Y at the intersection of Hollywood and Vine? It is cer- tainly true that this happened-there was a rea- son. But it is also true that the rules of logic didn't preordain the crash, and that given the vagaries of how individual schedules are so often changed by a few minutes, that it was hardly inevitable that the particular crash should have taken place. At a demographic or population level, an insurance company would have predicted that for a given number of cars and a certain time of day, that a specific number of accidents would occur. Although there was a reason of course for the crash, or the death of an individual or the extinction of a species, "fit- ness" or "adaptation" may not have been a fac- tor . . . unless one defines them to have been a factor. In a world of fixed total resources that fluctuates from time to time and place to place, where individuals cannot live forever, it may be no more than bad luck as to which species per- sist, or die. I would like to turn now to special cases of extinction and the Permo-Triassic interval of time. Extinctions exceeded originations to such an extent that there was a factor of two reduc- tion in families . . . and necessarily a greater reduction in genera and in species. The over- whelming approach of paleontologists has been to focus on those taxa which died out and to deduce what was wrong with them. The first task, however, is to determine if membership in a particular taxon-taxonness, so to speak- made a difference as to which taxa survived and which didn't. If extinctions were random with respect to the available living taxa, then there would appear to be no special point in concern- ing oneself with deterministic explanations. Such explanations would be suitable for under- standing what happened to particular taxa but would be of limited general significance. One approach to evaluate whether extinc- tions are nonrandom is (1) to have the number of families for each group at the beginning and end of the interval in question; (2) to have the probability of familial extinctions for the inter- val as a whole; and (3) to compare the actual number of extinctions with the predicted num- ber of extinctions. Even then, however, if one accepts at 95% confidence limit for detecting randomness, 1 out of 20 groups will behave in a "nonrandom" way. One way to test for sig- nificance was used by Raup (1978) who found that extinction in echinoderm classes behaved as though Permo-Triassic extinctions had been random. Even if a group is shown statistically to have had an inordinate amount of extinction within a given interval of time, that could still be for a very simple reason unrelated to taxonness. Owing to the vagaries of history, most members of that group could have been in a single bio- geographic region, and for reasons of climate or plate-tectonics that region was largely obliter- ated-independent of what was living there. This could well have been the case for North American Western Interior dinosaur faunas be- cause when the Cretaceous seas withdrew, and the Mediterranean-type climate turned to a des- ert climate, adaptation within any normal meaning of expectation was denied to the in- habitants. "Fitness" within the range of a given adaptive regime would have had nothing to do with this scenario of extinction. For those who feel uncomfortable with rele- gating "fitness" to a minor role, let me give another example. To claim that fitness is im- portant in extinction is like saying that from World War II, the inhabitants of Dresden were less fit than those of Greifswald because most of those in Dresden didn't adapt fast enough to</page><page sequence="11">PROGRESS IN PALEONTOLOGY 347 fire-bombing. A more reasonable way to view those deaths is that it was a matter of chance where a person was born, and that the death of the people was unrelated to any reasonable con- cept of fitness. Perhaps most extinctions of the fossil record are due to a process whereby en- vironmental variation simply moves beyond gross adaptational possibilities. If so, extinction might best be considered a random process, un- related to the fitness of any given taxon. A model of extinction which is basically sto- chastic can be set up in the following way. In Figure 2 are shown three plots of number of individuals versus number of species for, say, birds in a small garden, a city and a country. It is a common experience that most individuals in a given region will belong to a few species. Waiting a long time, however, the rare species (of which there are many) will be seen. The gen- eral shape of the individual/taxon curve is a "hollow" curve. Let us further grant that a minimum number of individuals per unit area is required for re- production. The larger the area, the more in- dividuals which can be supported, and the larg- er the number of species with populations above the minimum number for reproduction. Simply to reduce habitable area creates a reduction in number of individuals and therefore in number of taxa. As habitable area is reduced, individ- uals which happened to be in a given region will die because resources for survival are not present. There are of course many factors which would contribute to the death of various indi- viduals of a species. The factors which deter- mined which individuals were present in a giv- en region may be so complex and multifaceted that in practice the phenomenon of extinction is best viewed as a stochastic process. By this scenario, extinction is a random process. High- est probability for survival would fall on those taxa initially in greatest abundance. All of the above is not to deny the values of deterministic explanations at the appropriate scale. There are sensible deterministic accounts which tell one how it is that a species is adapted to where you find it. It is important to identify the physical, chemical and other constraints on species adaptations. But the actual process whereby the number of individuals becomes so reduced that reproductive success is threatened A B C Number of A Sm11 Gad City ountry individuals } SmlGrdnCtCuty Minimum Number of Individuals T T T for Reproducion 0 8TC Number of Taxa FIGURE 2. Plots of number of individuals versus number of taxa for hypothetical collection of organisms (say birds) in a small garden, city and country. TA, TB and Tc are the number of taxa which reproduce in each region. Note that as area increases, a larger total number of individuals can be supported, and a larger number of taxa will be able to have reproductive success. and then denied can be owing to any one of several causes which are not mutually exclu- sive. It is my belief that the reason for the appeal of strictly deterministic explanations for phe- nomena which involve hundreds of thousands or more discrete "particles" is that our history, traditions, training and literature focus so much on particular taxa, stages, specific outcrops, etc., that we are almost compelled to explain this or that bedding surface, or this or that ex- tinction, rather than to consider each case as merely one example of many. Our whole focus is on the microcosm of a historical event rather than the macrocosm of events in general. If we make the distinction of "few" versus ''many," then it is quite easy to consider immediate de- terministic explanations for the individual cases (the movement of individual molecules) but to reserve stochastic explanations for the ensemble of events (the movement of molecules too nu- merous to count). A Stochastic View I have claimed above that stochastic theory is appropriate for dealing with populations of particles. Here I wish to indicate which paleon- tological patterns have now been considered from a stochastic point of view (aspects also re- viewed by Raup 1977a; Raup and Schopf 1978; Gould 1978). At the level of patterns of expansion and con- traction of taxonomic diversity, Raup et al. (1973) discovered that most of the variation in real-world patterns of taxonomic expansion and contraction can be generated by the simplest stochastic model of evolutionary diversification.</page><page sequence="12">348 THOMAS J. M. SCHOPF Gould et al. (1977) extended this work to show that the shape of the clades of these simulations can hardly if at all be distinguished from those of the real world. And considering morphologic trends within a clade, Raup and Gould (1974) suggested that more often than not, a unidirec- tional trend was the expected observation in a stochastic system. Most random walks appear to be going somewhere! An increase in special- ization was also confirmed as an expected result of stochastic speciation. Van Valen (1973) found by induction, and Raup et al. (1973) developed by deduction, the observation that in a world where rates of orig- ination and extinction are due to chance, that the survivorship curve is log-linear; that is, there is a constant rate of extinction through time. Schopf et al. (1975) suggested that this conclusion could apply to all taxa, independent of taxonness, provided that the taxa were nor- malized for their vastly different degrees of mor- phologic complexity. Rates of evolution could well be uniform through time. Anderson (1974) and Anderson and Anderson (1975) showed how the species/genus ratio, species/family ratio and species/order ratio of mammals could be simu- lated in a world of random extinction and orig- ination (but with equal probabilities). Plots of these taxonomic ratios are the "hollow curves" widely known from the extensive work of Willis (1922) whose explanations, however, were en- tirely deterministic. Most recently, Sepkoski (1978, 1979) devel- oped a kinetic model of diversification through the Phanerozoic using the notion from island biogeography that a faunal equilibrium should result as rates of extinction and origination come to balance each other. An equilibrium is- land-biogeographic model had previously been applied to patterns of extinction through the geologic record (Flessa and Imbrie 1973; T. J. M. Schopf 1974a; Simberloff 1974). The net effect of the papers reviewed in the previous two paragraphs is that there is now a considerable body of literature which illustrates that many of the major features of evolution can be simulated by stochastic processes. A pos- sible basic outline of the stochastic view might include the following: (1) At uniform habitat type, the number of species is directly proportional to the area of the habitat. (2) At constant area of habitat, the rate of orig- ination of taxa is equivalent to the rate of extinction of taxa, and therefore there is a mean diversity which can exist at any given time. (3) Total diversity therefore varies as a function of the number and size and ecologic setting of the areas available for colonization. (4) With a constant average rate of extinction and origination, there is an equilibrium clade shape. (5) Origination and extinction are random with respect to membership in a taxonomic group. That is, replay geologic history with- in the same general ecologic constraints as have prevailed, and it could well be that (for example!) blastoids live through the Permian, and the crinoids die out. (6) When morphology is considered for each lin- eage, extremes in specialization (relative to an ancestral group) drift from initial values and eventually become the norm. (7) Average rates of genomic change are within the normal bounds of biological processes (i.e., with a coefficient of variation of about 10 or less). However, owing to our percep- tion of differences in morphologic complex- ity, differences in rates of morphologic change and therefore assumed rates of spe- ciation mask and exaggerate biological dif- ferences in rate of speciation. Surely the discovery that for all intents and purposes the millions of species behave in some situations as though they are "particles" over the vast expanse of geologic time is in no sense "defeatist" to recall Thayer's quote cited above. If it is defeatist, then so is Henry's Law, Boyle's Law, Charles' Law, Graham's Law, Avogad- ro's Law, and Guy-Lussac's Law in chemistry, or the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in phys- ics (Bohm 1977). In "particle paleontology" it appears that stochastic processes are not only of major importance but perhaps of controlling importance in understanding the vast panorama of the fossil record (T. J. M. Schopf 1974b). There is, in sum, simply a different level of analysis between concern with individual his-</page><page sequence="13">PROGRESS IN PALEONTOLOGY 349 torical events or taxa and with the probabilities of all events of all taxa. Problems to Solve In Paleontology The core area of a science can be said to be defined by the nature of the problems which are considered worth solving (and not by the nature of the knowledge which is agreed upon at any given time). In the case of paleontology, a two track system seems worth emphasizing. On the one side are the historical problems rooted in specific taxa and specific times. These are large- ly the problems which by tradition have been approached for deterministic explanations. A recent list gives a ranking of the "top 10" major evolutionary events, all of which require expla- nation (see List 1). It is typical of such lists to conclude, as indeed this one does, with the or- igin of man. Non-paleontological historians also have their list, and it would include such items as what caused the American Civil War, what was responsible for the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, etc. List 1. "Top Ten" major evolutionary events that have occurred during the course of biolog- ical evolution (from J. W. Schopf 1974). Origin of: 1. Life (prokaryotic heterotrophs) 2. Blue-green algae (oxygen-producting pho- toautotrophy) 3. Eukaryotes (mitosis) 4. Sexuality (meiosis) 5. Metascopic multicellularity (metaphytes and metazoans) 6. Vertebrate animals 7. Vascular plants 8. Warm-blooded animals 9. Flowering plants 10. Man On the other side are what might be called the ahistorical problems which do not focus on specific events per se but rather try to ask ques- tions about the basic units (individuals, species, etc.) and about the processes and state variables in a stochastic framework. The sort of topic which is of interest here is, what are the life history equivalents of the gas laws, is there such a thing as an Avogadro's number for diversity, etc. In List 2, I have given what seem to me to be major questions of this sort. By their very nature, items in List 2 will not be answered from a deterministic viewpoint. List 2. A list of problems in paleobiology. Problems 1 and 2 are concerned with limiting values of "particles." Perhaps these limits are meaningless numbers in the same sense that the total number of atoms in the universe is a mean- ingless number. Rather, what may be biologi- cally meaningful is the number per unit area, or unit volume. Because organisms chiefly occupy a flat surface (in contrast to gases), the most impor- tant mode of expression is probably per unit area. If so, problems 1 and 2 should be further reduced to per unit area. Problem 3 concerns rates of change. Problems 4, 5 and 6 concern "innate" properties of species. Problem 7 is about ways in which species are organized among themselves by degree of evolutionary relatedness. Problem 8 concerns evaluating the bias of "fossilization po- tential. " 1. Given (1) the sun's energy, and (2) the stan- dard efficiency of metabolism of carbon, use data on food-chain analysis to determine the total number of individuals of successively different sizes for each level in a food chain until no more biodegradable carbon exists. Does the product of the number of individu- als of each given size times the size in ques- tion equal a constant for each size class? How can one, from paleontology, determine whether or not this limit on number of indi- viduals has changed over geologic time? 2. Large-sized species are less abundant than small-sized species, in a regular way. May (1978) reported that "The overall trend for organisms ranging in size from about a cen- timeter to a few meters is that a threefold increase in length corresponds to a tenfold decrease in number of species." Stated diffe- rently, the volume (almost 10 times larger) and the number of species (about 1/10th as many) appear approximately to cancel out each other, so that the product of the number of species of a given size times their volume equals a constant, for all size-classes. If so, summed over all size-classes, knowledge of the biovolume provides an order of mag-</page><page sequence="14">350 THOMAS J. M. SCHOPF nitude limit on the number of species which can exist. What is this biovolume limit? How can one, from paleontology, determine whether or not this biovolume limit has changed over geologic time? If the biovolume limit has changed, what are the implications for species richness over geologic time? 3. The size of individuals and their generation time are closely related (Bonner, 1965). What is the "generation time" of species? How (if at all) have these rates changed? What set of ecologic or geologic conditions would lead to rates of change whose mean values were 100 times faster (or slower) than the observed rates? 4. How could one tell whether or not species interactions have become less, or more, "finely tuned" over geologic time? 5. Is there any aspect of "taxonness" which is critical for the understanding of the fossil record? If so, then why hasn't this been evolved by all groups if it is beneficial, or lost by all groups if it is not beneficial? 6. Can one logically rule out the possibility that there exists at least one species such that it has an "inner drive" toward perfection-or extinction? 7. Can there be developed an equilibrium (stochastic) theory to account for phylogene- tic relationships among taxa (Schopf, 1971)? The form of a phylogenetic tree in the sense of (1) the number of major groups, and (2) the relative size of these groups, has been dealt with by Anderson and Anderson (1975) and Anderson (1974). Given empirical evi- dence of factors (1) and (2) from the fossil record, is there a predicted probability dis- tribution which is powerful enough to be used as a null hypothesis for comparison with these properties in various phylogenetic reconstructions? At any given time, for example, for a given number of species, is it more reasonable to expect 10, 50 or 100 phyla? 8. Because of assemblages which repeat them- selves from place to place in a given time interval, there seems to be a regularity in what is fossilized. Fossilization is a function of starting biologic materials (abundance, chemical composition, etc.), and subsequent geologic history (type of environment, type of mineralization, type of diagenesis, etc.). On the order of 70 percent of the photic zone shelly fauna genera may be fossilized (Schopf, 1978). A first-order calibration has not been obtained for other environments, nor have estimates been surmised of the per- centage coverage of shallow seas by the dif- ferent environmental types. We need to know the fossilization potential for each of the major types of environments, and the percentage of each type of environment on a period by period basis over geologic time. Such an analysis would indicate the extent to which changes in diversity through geologic time were a function of changes in the en- vironmental types as seen in the rock record. In sum, what is the pattern of diversity as normalized for fossilization potential? Paleontologists, of course, not only seek an- swers to the topics on the attached lists, but also work through the traditional topics regarding the description of taxa and the correlation of rock units-and even at this level there is a hi- erarchy of interest. Any list of major problems would include solution of the precise correlation of the latest Permian on a world-wide basis, many of the classical boundary disputes, etc. At the present time, the "core" area of what passes for paleontology is undergoing a con- siderable change involving not just the contin- ual "factual" aspect which indeed always changes. Rather, the nature of what is an in- teresting question has begun to include aspects of stochastic processes-such as how to distin- guish bona fide evolutionary trends (where nat- ural selection is called upon) from trends which are equally well described as random walks through time (Raup 1977b). Paleontology is coming to have a theory which is based on species as particles, and which is derived from internal standards of the field rather than bor- rowing from biology or geology. Summary The purpose of this paper has been to develop the appropriate level at which deterministic ver- sus stochastic processes can be applied. To de-</page><page sequence="15">PROGRESS IN PALEONTOLOGY 35 1 velop this theme, I have sought to point out that history when viewed at the time it is occurring is reasonably described within a stochastic framework-events are far from predeter- mined. Only in retrospect do historical events appear "inevitable," and thus become candi- dates for narrow deterministic explanations. The deterministic mode of explanation also fol- lows from the traditional inductive mode of pa- leontological reasoning-the often necessary fo- cus on specific outcrops, fossils, events and environments. This focus on a literal reading of the fossil record has had a profound effect on those documenting "rates of evolution." Biolog- ical determinism has been the most popular ex- planation for the apparent difference in rates in different taxa, and for apparent selectivity in faunal extinctions. Although such deterministic explanations are possible (almost anything is possible), the explanation may not be appropri- ate. Many of the patterns of evolution which traditionally have been viewed in a determin- istic framework have been placed during the past decade in a perfectly plausible stochastic framework. Many basic questions remain to be understood, both in deterministic and in sto- chastic terms. Acknowledgments I thank D. L. Hull, M. Wade, D. M. Raup, J. J. Sepkoski, S. J. Gould and R.
