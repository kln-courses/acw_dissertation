<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Dream of Descartes. By Jacques Maritain. Translated by Mabelle L. Andison. (New York: Philosophical Library, 1944. Pp. 220. $3.00.) It is hardly possible for the present reviewer to add anything to the general volume of praise which greeted the publication of this book. Its obvious virtues have been extolled enthusiastically, and often with more zeal than sober judgment. But the interests of truth are usually better served if criticism be allowed to temper enthusiasm. This review will therefore limit itself to a few observations which may serve as a guide for a more discriminating appraisal of M. Maritain's contribution. The first problem which confronts the reader of The Dream of Des- cartes is the work's significance and direction. Is it a contribution to the history of philosophy? to systematic philosophy? to theology? to some ill-defined conglomeration of all three? or to what? M. Maritain tells us in the Preface that he has attempted "to try to determine the value and significance of the Cartesian reform with regard to metaphysical and theol- ogical wisdom." But despite many poetic praises of metaphysics, we are left in the dark regarding the nature of the discipline that Descartes is supposed to have "degraded" and which M. Maritain defends so rhetoric- ally. As regards theology, M. Maritain does not make use of the theological sources, but confines himself to the opinions of certain theologians. So despite what he has attempted to do, his contribution is likely to be judged as a contribution to the history of philosophy and his observations about systematic philosophy and theology are likely to be regarded as clouding the issue. But The Dream of Descartes can hardly claim to be pure "history of philosophy." In the first place, M. Maritain does not simply expound</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 389 Descartes' teaching; he interprets it - and always in the light of M. Mari- tain's own convictions. On the basis of this interpretation, Descartes is then fitted into a preconceived scheme of the history of philosophy in general. In a recent issue of Franciscan Studies (Sept., 1945, pp. 301-308) Professor Ernest A. Moody did students of philosophy and or the history of philos- ophy a great service in his acute analysis of "a highly rhetorical discourse on the philosophical meaning of the history of philosophy." He drew attention to a curious method of writing the history of philosophy as exem- plified in Professor Pegis' introduction to The Basic Writings of St. Tho- mas Aquinas - a method which he characterized as a "game of diagnosing the history of philosophy in terms of 'isms' and errors" {loc. cit., p. 306). This "philosophical" treatment of the history of philosophy is further char- acterized by Prof. Moody as "Hegel's procedure of reconstructing intellec- tual history in such a manner as to illustrate (one's) own philosophy" {ibid.). This characterization fits M. Maritain's treatment of Descartes per- fectly. For example, Descartes' system is variously diagnosed as rationalism (p. 26), dogmatism and scepticism ( ibid .), idealism, intuitionism, Ange- lism (pp. 26, 28, 169), mechanism, intellectualist nominalism, ontologism (p. 55), naturalism (p. 98), dualism (p. 169), anthropomorphic in theod- icy (p. 151), anti-theological fideism (p. 79, 175), etc. As regards the scheme of philosophy into which Descartes is fitted, M. Maritain seems anxious to link up even eminent scholastics with the Descartes he thinks he has discredited by these uncomplimentary "tags". Scotus is made out to be a precursor of Leibnitz, and St. Bonaventure and Scotus are designated as the source of the Cartesian notion of ideas (notes 141 and 196). The ironical part about this attribution is that no text of Scotus himself is quoted, but only Cajetan's report of what Scotus said! Are the texts of Scotus so inaccessible that an historian must rely on what a confessed adversary has to say about him? Suarez, Vasquez, and of course St. Anselm, are likewise linked up with Descartes - on the basis of similar unhistorical speculation. The whole of Chapter Four, indeed, is a pitiful misunderstanding of the ratio anselmi (which M. Maritain prejudicially persists in referring to as the "Ontological argument") and the scholastic (and Aristotelian) ideal of strict demonstration. In looking for an explanation of M. Maritain's opposition to Des- cartes, several of the footnotes seem to provide the best answers. Notes 33 and 108 show that M. Maritain, while decrying Descartes' conception of Physics, is intent on preserving the notions developed in the Physics of Aristotle. Could it be because the Physics of Aristotle are so fundamental to the Metaphysics which Maritain is so anxious to preserve? If so, he might well give more sympathetic consideration to the following passage from Descartes (which is quoted in note 108): It seems to me we must be careful to distinguish the opinions decided upon by the Church from those commonly accepted by Doctors and which ar e founded upon an uncertain Physics. In general, lack of sympathy for the intellectual efforts of all but one man is the outstanding weakness of this book; or perhaps we should rather say "two men," since Maritain confesses that he is a "simple and ingenuous FRANCISCAN STUDIES - 9</page><page sequence="3">390 BOOK REVIEWS follower of Cajetan and of John of St. Thomas" - a very illuminating con- fession and an important point for the student of Maritain to bear in mind. This lack of sympathy leads him to blandly identify scholasticism with one school and to be content to accept unjustifiable criticisms of other schools on the basis of unreliable secondary sources only. This prejudice has its amusing side. Maritain dismisses Descartes because, he says, he claims the impossible for his system, namely, that it knows all the answers. But when M. Maritain points out that Descartes cannot know all the answers because Descartes' solutions do not conform with Maritain' s own, does not this criticism contain, by implication, a condemnation of the system which Mari- tain uses as a touchstone of Descartes' system? By far the most unfortunate feature of the whole book is the fact that M. Maritain seems intent to discredit Descartes rather than argue his case dispassionately. For inst√†nce, he makes much of the speculation that Des- cartes might have been influenced by Rosicrucianism, on the basis of the simple fact that Descartes was in close scientific relationship with a mathe- matician, Faulhaber, who was a Rosicrucian. After two pages of speculation on this point M. Maritain admits, of course, that "all this is pure conjecture," but the damage is done - suspicion has been aroused and Descartes is discredited. In the same way, the "higher criticism" which Knox satirized so brilliantly in Essays in Satire is applied to the incident of the Dream - in such a way that Descartes' whole scientific endeavor is made to appear as the outcome of a "cerebral episode" or a fit of "mental depression." This spirit of disparagement, as we have pointed out, also manifests itself in Maritain's treatment of St. Bonaventure, Scotus, Ockham, Vasquez, Suarez, St. Anselm, and others. It merely embarrasses the reader and certainly does not forward the cause of which M. Maritain is so ardent a champion. The general impression that a reading of The Dream of Descartes leaves is this: what a pity that such an extensive knowledge of the Cartesian sources is not put to better purpose. This might have been a great book. Sebastian Day, O.F.M. Franciscan Institute, St. Bonaventure, N.Y.</page></plain_text>
