MARCH 1999 / ART EDUCATION</page><page sequence="2">NATURE'S FOUR SEASONS AS INSPIRATION: ...I used to harbor the thought that oneyearofNature chronology wouldfinish the job-would rob succeedingyears of new chronologies. Even tho I walk forever on the same paths &amp; in the woods &amp;fields, and even note the same phenomena, each year will bring a new chronology, for my view of life is ever changing. The thought is still more ludicrous when I think of the meagerness of my observations. -Charles Burchfield, Jan. 9th, 1915, Poetry of Place The selection from Charles Burchfield's journals underscores how nature has continually served as inspiration for artists throughout the centuries. Nature embodies our ecstasies as we witness the new life of spring and the intensity of summer. It captures our mortality as the bright colors of fall signal the coming dormancy and repose of winter. Nature itself is a theme that has been depicted throughout time and across cultures and media. Regardless of which time in history or which culture views nature, it embodies the cycles of life and hints of resurrections, both physical and psychic. Each of the four works of art selected for this resource, Charles Burchfield's October Wind and Sunlight in the Woods, Utagawa Hiroshige's Fujikawa (from Tokaido Road), Childe Hassam's Bridge At Old Lyme, and Georgia O'Keeffe's Red Barn, Lake George, New York, tells the story of the events or nuances of a season that made an impression on the artist. As we examine each composition, we see a different aspect of nature. Burchfield's nature is a world filled with teeming spirits; a vital life-force permeates each tree and leaf blown by the autumn wind. In contrast, Hiroshige's serene world exudes a powerful sense of calmness as the snowflakes gently blanket a Japanese village and countryside. Hassam's light palette captures the shimmering quality of light and the vibrancy of color felt on a lovely spring day. O'Keeffe's contained forms communicate the quiet power and the solidity of nature as she depicts the clear, blue sky of summer. It is our objective to offer high school art teachers a unit of four lessons that can guide students to appreciate and create their own artworks that depict their personal views of nature and, specifically, the four seasons. These activities are designed to encourage students' observational skills and to go beyond depicting objective details in their work in order to bring to their art personal symbols and expressions. FALL CHARLES BURCHFIELD American (1893-1967) October Wind and Sunlight in the Woods, 1962 Watercolor, The Georgia Museum of Art ABOUT THE ARTIST Burchfield was born in Ashtabula, Ohio. His early paintings depict small-town New England scenes where houses and storefronts seem to possess human faces and personalities. From 1943 on, he concentrated on watercolor landscapes and transferred his anthropomorphic expression to the scenes of nature. As an art student, Burchfield was influenced by his readings in philosophy, especially transcendentalism, a philosophy that states: Nature is formed and informed by spirit; that a leaf or pebble, mountain or star, is a symbol of a greater spiritual reality, both beyond and within; that God not only created nature but is in nature. (Cohn, 1985) His transformation of the landscape is an outgrowth of the promise of the new world that shaped the concept of nature within the United States from the early 19th century onward. Not only did the wilderness in its vastness and mystery hold God's spirit, but America and the "Divine" landscape were ART EDUCATION / MARCH 1999</page><page sequence="3">INSTRUCTIONAL S|---= intrinsically linked. Burchfield was also rooted in the Romantic tradition that sought to express feelings of awe and reverence for nature and sensitivity to its various changes and nuances (Cohn, 1985). As a student, Burchfield read Hinduism, Buddhism, and Nordic and Aryan myths. From this study came the impulse to depict sounds, to anthropomorphize the landscape, and to convey a land brimming with insect, bird, and spiritual life. Burchfield later converted to Lutheranism in 1944, which further developed his belief that nature was an expression of the mind of God. He came to believe that his excellence as a painter was intrinsically connected with his growing relationship with God (Bauer,1982). He was a quiet man who preferred the company of his family and the woods near his home to that of the larger public. In the woods he found a healer for his often troubled emotions, a companion, and a friend. He wrote in his journal: If all musical sounds were to be forever silenced- orchestras, bands, human voices, birds and insects-and I were allowed to retain one sound to cheer me, I would ask that the wind might play in the treetops. (Townsend [Ed.], 1993) ABOUT THE ART Upon viewing October Wind and Sunlight in the Woods, it is obvious that this is no ordinary woods. One's attention is captured by the bits of dazzling sunlight that fill the scene, giving it the beauty of an enchanted dance. The woods are filled with insects and trees that come alive with faces. Butterflies-often symbols of the human soul and its flight through an earthly existence to the realm of the spirit-seem to flutter their wings in the autumn wind. This painting reveals an enchanted scene replete with a spiritual life and vitality characteristic of Burchfield's unique vision. Burchfield did not paint nature's appearances, but its forces. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1. How does Burchfield create the impression of the forces of nature throughout this painting? 2. How are faces and creatures integrated in the painting? 3. What feeling does this painting convey? 4. How did Burchfield express "autumn"? ACTIVITY Ask students to visualize an outdoor setting they experienced in autumn. Then ask them to do a watercolor painting of the scene. Encourage the students to use expressive lines, colors, and anthropomorphic devices such as creating faces on leaves and trees, to capture the "spirit" of their landscapes. Ask students to write a short description of the emotions they expressed in their paintings about their environment Evaluate work based on the students' ability to go beyond a physical description of nature and seasonal mood. WINTER UTAGAWA HIROSHIGE Japanese (1797-1858) Fujikawa (from Tokaido Road), 1855 Color woodblock on paper, 13 '/2 x 8 7/8 inches, The University of Georgia, Georgia Museum of Art ABOUT THE ARTIST Utagawa Hiroshige was born in 1797 in Edo (now commonly known as Tokyo), Japan. He was the eldest son of a low-ranking sumurai, a minor official of the shogunal fire department. In fact, many of his ancestors had been fire wardens, and Hiroshige might have followed this career path, had his family not recognized and encouraged his drawing talents as a child. Following apprenticeships to master artists, where he learned the elements of brushwork, composition, and the importance of atmosphere, Hiroshige became interested in the ukiyo-e genre. Ukiyo-e, translated as "pictures of the floating world," refers to a style of printmaking that was popular in Japan in the 1800s. Popular prints of this "floating world" represent an idealized view of Japanese landscape that is related to the actual climate and physical landscape. At the age of 15, Hiroshige became a pupil of ukiyo-e master artist Utagawa Toyohiro, whose lyrical style greatly influenced him. For several years, Hiroshige worked as a book illustrator and bijinga (pictures of beautiful women) artist He became a full-fledged landscape artist following the publication of fellow artist Hokusai's prints Thirty Six Views ofMount Fuji. Hiroshige is best remembered as a prolific painter and full-color landscape printmaker, producing more than 5,000 works during his lifetime. His work is recognizable due to his sensitivity toward nature and atmospheric designs. ABOUT THE ART During 1830 Hiroshige traveled along the Tokaido, the eastern sea road between Kyoto and Edo. During his journey, Hiroshige documented a plethora of activity and landscapes of the Japanese countryside in his sketchbooks. Much of what he saw and experienced through his travels was later represented in his sequential print series Tokaido gojusantsugi no uchi (Fifty-three Stages of the Tokaido). Each print depicted one of the "stages," or travelers' rest stops, along the Tokaido road. These prints were MARCH 1999 / ART EDUCATION</page><page sequence="4">Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese 1797-1858), Fujikawa (from the Vertical Tokaido), 1855 Color woodblock on paper, 131/2 x 87/8 inches.

Hiroshige's journey continued to influence his work throughout his entire life. Shortly before his death, he completed another series of prints focusing on the Tokaido Road. Unlike the horizontal format used in the earlier series, these works all utilized a vertical format. It is from this later series of the Tokaido that we have this winter scene titled Fujikawa (from Tokaido Road). DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1. Think about how difficult it was to travel in the 1800s. Why would an artist depict certain locations along a road? 2. Hiroshige's prints show us whatJapan looked like during the 1800s. What images of your world would you create to preserve "your viewpoint" for future generations? 3. What does it mean to be apprenticed to an artist? What were the benefits and drawbacks of learning art this way? 4. Find areas of the work that contain Japanese (writing) characters. Why do you think these were included? Compare advertisements you have seen recently in magazines that contain images and text. How are these similar to this work? ACTIVITIES-PRINTMAKING: ONE VIEW FROM MY WORLD Ask students: Think of a trip you have taken recently. (It could be a family trip, a school field trip, or the journey from your home to school.) Where did you go? What are some of the images that you saw? How could you convey the season in your work? Have students create several thumbnail sketches with simplified designs, then have them select one with the strongest composition. Enlarge this design and create a "moder" wood block print. Evaluate students' work based on design elements and technical mastery of printing. SPRING CHITDE HASSAM American (1859-1935) Bridge at Old Lyme, 1908 Oil on canvas, 24 x 27 inches, The University of Georgia, Georgia Museum of Art Eva Underhill Holbrook Memorial Collection of American Art, Gift of Alfred H. Holbrook, 1945 ABOUT THE ARTIST Childe Hassam is recognized as one of the foremost U.S. Impressionist painters. Like Hiroshige, he served an apprenticeship as a young man. Surprisingly, however, this early apprenticeship was not with a painter; it was with a wood engraver. For approximately ten years, between 1870 and 1880, Hassam earned his living as an illustrator of children's books in the Boston, Massachusetts area. During the mid 1880s, while he and his wife were living in Paris, Hassam's oils and watercolors began reflecting his knowledge of the French Impressionists' work, as his brush work became more broken and his palette became lighter. Although he adopted an Impressionistic style, his figures continued to exhibit a solidarity, creating a unique style that has come to be recognized as American Impressionism. Hassam's work captured both the bustling activities of urban life as well as the rural charm of quaint cottages and gardens. At the age of 55, he turned his attention to printmaking and produced over 350 etchings and 40 lithographs. ABOUT THE ART Vacations represent a time to spend with family and friends at a location other than home. Childe Hassam spent a great deal of time visiting friends and painting along the New England coast. In many cases, the landscape and seashore inspired Hassam during his travels. In this case, Bridge at Old Lyme portrays the countryside in Old Lyme, Connecticut. This work is representative of the American Impressionist style as it is filled with sensuous color and light and executed with choppy brushstrokes. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1. Why do you think the artist chose to depict this location? 2. Look carefully for a figure in the painting. Describe the types of brushstrokes used to create this figure. 3. Compare the types of brush strokes used in the figure to those used in other areas of the landscape. 4. What time of year is represented? What clues lead you to those conclusions? ACTIVITY This activity centers around drawing the landscape and developing observational skills. Discuss how one could include elements from nature that will suggest a specific time. During the spring, take students outside and have them draw their surroundings using watercolor colored pencils. Demonstrate how to use the pencils in order to create quick, loose sketches and how water may be applied to the media, creating an impressionistic feel. Evaluate work on the students' success using impressionistic pencil technique, composition, and their portrayal of the season. ART EDUCATION / MARCH 1999</page><page sequence="7">INSTRUCTIONAL SI SUMMER GEORGIA O'KEEFFE American (1887-1986) Red Barn, Lake George, New York, 1921 Oil on canvas, 14" x 16 /2 ", The University of Georgia, Georgia Museum of Art Eva Undersell Holbrook Collection of American Art, Gift of Alfred H. Holbrook ABOUT THE ARTIST O'Keeffe was born in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Art Students' League of New York. As an artist, she is known for her purity of form, close-up views of flowers, cow skulls, and scenes from New Mexico where she moved in 1949. According to O'Keeffe, she used her art to express ideas and sensations that she could not express through words. O'Keeffe became part of the group of early moder artists represented by Alfred Stieglitz in the 291 Gallery in New York City. O'Keeffe's career spanned the entire period of moder art ABOUT THE ART The Red Barn, Lake George, New York is characteristic of O'Keeffe's hard-edge realism. The painting is precise, controlled, and emotionally subdued. O'Keeffe expressed the subject in a simplified form that emphasizes art elements such as line, shape, color, and value. As is characteristic of her work, she sought to capture the essence of her subject and created a balanced composition that conveyed the solidity and calm majesty of the red barn. O'Keeffe spent her summers in Lake George for many years. This was the summer home of her husband's (Alfred Stieglitz) parents. Her art was influenced by colored Japanese woodcut prints of the 19th century with their flattened forms and soft colors. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS This painting, The Red Barn, Lake George, New York, demonstrates O'Keeffe's use of simplified forms that are abstracted from nature. 1. What do you see in this painting? 2. How is this painting different from a photograph? 3. How can you tell this painting depicts summer? 4. What mood does the painting convey? Why? ACTIVITY Have students talk about somewhere they visited during a summer and describe the sensation of the place. Then ask students to sketch from memory their special summer locations. Ask them to simplify the forms, shapes, and composition to capture the essence of the scene, concentrating on saying the most with the least amount of information. When the sketches are complete, the students will paint their composition. Ask them to consider what mood their colors communicate. Does this mood accurately express their feelings about the experience and location? Students will be evaluated on their ability to convey the sensation of summer through their color scheme and simplified forms.
