<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUSEUM HELVETICUM Vol.58 2001 Fasc.4 The Proem of Lucretius By Edward Courtney, Virginia Of the numerous problems raised by Lucretius' opening address to Venus, the central one is highlighted by the following quotation: "The most enigmatic feature of the proem lies in the first three subdivi sions, 1-43. How can Lucretius, as an Epicurean, praise Venus as a controlling force in nature, and even beg her to intervene in human affairs? In Epi cureanism, the gods emphatically do not intervene in any way in human affairs ... To respond that the proem's treatment of Venus is allegorical is not in itself a solution to the puzzle. As Lucretius himself warns at 2.655-660, allegorical use of divinities, e.g. 'Neptune' for the sea and 'Ceres' for corn, is permissible only if one avoids any false religious implications. Although Venus might, on this prin ciple, get away with symbolising nature, or even perhaps Epicurean pleasure (the suggestion of E. Bignone, Storia délia letteratura latina II (Florence 1945) 137-144 ...), the opening address to her as ancestress of the Romans can hardly be judged equally innocent, nor can the prayers to her to intervene in Roman affairs and to inspire Lucretius' poetry. It is not that these allegorical explana tions do not carry any weight at all. I think there is much truth in them. But the most they can do, for readers who have read on and been surprised to learn that this is an Epicurean poem, is mitigate their bafflement. The question remains, what can have impelled Lucretius to start out so misleadingly, totally disavow ing the attitude to the gods that the rest of the poem will so energetically pro mote? It is hardly an exaggeration to say that he spends the remainder of the poem undoing the damage done by the first forty-three lines." This quotation is from an article by D. N. Sedley, "The Proems of Em pedocles and Lucretius", GRBS 30 (1989) 281, now reproduced in his book Lucretius and the Transformation of Greek Wisdom (Cambridge 1998) 16. He is by profession a student of philosophy, and the quotation admirably encapsu lates the puzzled reaction expressed by many who have approached the poem concentrating on its philosophical content. The interesting thing is that it shows a glimmer of recognition that the poem also needs to be judged as a literary artefact (Lucretius himself makes it plain that the poetry was hardly less impor tant to him than the philosophy), and even, in the phrase "for readers who have read on and been surprised to learn that this is an Epicurean poem", a sense of the way to approach the problem. 14 Museum Helveticum</page><page sequence="2">202 Edward Courtney This way is indicated in some remarks by M. R. Gale, Myth and Poetry in Lucretius (Cambridge 1994) 3 n. 8, which may usefully be contrasted with Sed ley's approach: "Any reading of the poem must be both diachronic and syn chronie, and the récurrence of an image forces the reader to reassess earlier pas sages in which it has occurred, as well as affecting the interprétation of the im médiate context"; 57 "Lucretius' proem, when taken in isolation, is to all ap pearances a perfectly conventional opening invocation ... the illusion is main tained for forty-three lines. Lucretius is playing a kind of elaborate game with his readers ... Lucretius ... manipulâtes the literary expectations of his reader, who is to be 'deceived but not harmed' [1.941; E. C.]. Only once he has been tempted into the poem by the poetic tour de force of the proem does the sym bolic meaning... become clear"; 211 "When the reader looks back at the proem from the vantage-point of the édita doctrina sapientum templa, he is forced to reassess its meaning". Essentially the rest of this paper will be drawing out the implications of these comments. Imagine yourself Walking through the streets of Rome in the late 60's or early 50's B.C., and seeing on the bookstalls a new work De Rerum Natura by a writer T. Lucretius Carus, of whom you have never heard anything. You buy a copy, take it home and begin to peruse it.

It is important that this passage be punctuated as above, since otherwise its structure, which brings with it generic significance, will be lost. The point is that the long parenthesis causes an anacoluthon; 4—5 are resumed with quoniam in 21-23, as is corroborated by the recall of exortum lumina 5 in luminis... exoritur 22-23, and 1-2 get a verb only in 24. The first two words point you, the new reader whom I have described above, to the traditional Venus of mythology; so does alma Venus, about which see Munro's note and G. Appel, De Romanorum precationibus (Glessen 1909) 99-100. In 2-4 we begin to recognise the traditional form of a hymn with 'Rela tiv-Prädikation' in address (E. Norden, Agnostos Theos, Leipzig/Berlin 1913, 172), which is followed in 4-22 by the equally traditional 'Du-Prädikation' in listing the powers of the deity (Norden 150); the latter takes up the former in chiastic order (sky, sea, earth 2-3; earth, sea, sky 7-9, with the three key words placed prominently at the line-ends, as my colleague Prof. J. F. Miller points out). When we get to 22, which (as already remarked) is part of the resumption of 4-5, we recognise another hymn-feature in the antithetic converse per te - sine te\ see Norden 157 n. 3.159 η. 1 with Nachträge 391. 349-350, Fraenkel on Aesch. Ag. 1485. If we punctuate e.g. as recommended by W. Kranz, "Lukrez und Empedokles", Philol. 96 (1943) 87 n. 33 and not as above, we obscure this antithesis. Before that, in 6-20 we have recognised yet another traditional fea ture in the récital of άρεταί της Οεου (Norden 150). Sola 21 keeps us in the same sacral sphere (Norden 350 n. 1), and finally in 28 comes the third of the regulär structural features of the hymn, the request da (see my remarks on the hymn of Tiberianus in Fragmentary Latin Poets (Oxford 1993) 433 with further référencés, including Appel 133); H. Diels, Lukrezstudien I, SBBerlin, Phil. hist. 1918.922-923 = Kl. Sehr, zur Gesch. der antiken Philos. (Hildesheim 1969) 322-323 compares the structure of Homeric hymn 24 to Hestia, vocative, rela tive clause, asyndetic Statement of her appearance, request to come and give χάρις to the poet's song. There is too a strong emphasis on the part that the goddess of sexual love has to play in propagation (4—5,19-20 [with which com pare Homeric hymn 5 to Aphrodite 73-74], 22), and she is linked with desire ('cupide 16, 20) and love (amor 19, amabile 23). One other quality of the goddess which has been introduced is lepos 15 'at tractiveness' (for the connotations of this word in Lucretius see C. J. Classen, "Poetry and Rhetoric in Lucretius", TAPA 99, 1968, 101 = Probleme der Lucrez-Forschung, ed. Classen, Hildesheim 1986, 356 and addendum 373), a quality which Lucretius hopes to incorporate in his own poem too (28) and</page><page sequence="4">204 Edward Courtney which motivâtes him to ask Venus for her aid (24), as the Muses and other dei ties traditionally inspire poets; we may compare how "in HHom. 10, Aphrodite is asked as the goddess of desire (ίμερος) to grant the poet a 'désirable' (ίμερόεσσαν) song" (Gale 209). She is also the appropriate deity because she supervises rerum natura (21), which in the context, after the references to prop agation listed above, must at least hint at the dérivation from nascor (cf. 5.331 and D. Clay, Lucretius and Epicurus, Ithaca 1983, 85), and his poem is to be de rerum natura (25; the words in the same metrical position, as Prof. Miller stresses). The specifically Roman side of the goddess, which in 1 was introduced by a patronymic, is revived in 26 with another patronymic Memmiades. The identity of the dedicatee provides yet another reason for choosing Venus; the coins of the Memmii show this goddess (S. Weinstock, Divus Julius, Oxford 1971,23 and pl. 3.3-4 [after p. 44]; M. H. Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, London 1974,1.320-321 no. 313; R. Schilling, La religion romaine de Vénus, Paris 1954, 272 and pl. 29.1 after p. 366). We will notice that Memmius is given the epithet noster, i.e. 'yours, Venus, and mine'; thus three personages are linked. And, if I may anticipate a little, there is another link between them all, for Venus 'propa gates' (20) living things, Lucretius 'propagates' verses (25), a horticultural metaphor (see Munro's note, and to his quotation from Paul. Fest. p. 212 M add ibid. 108 s.v. impages), and Memmius is the propago of his ancestors (42). effice ut interea fera moenera militiai 30 per maria ac terras omnis sopita quiescant; nam tu sola potes tranquilla pace iuuare mortalis, quoniam belli fera moenera Mauors armipotens regit, in gremium qui saepe tuum se reicit aeterno deuictus uulnere amoris 35 atque ita suspiciens, tereti ceruice reposta, pascit amore auidos inhians in te, dea, uisus eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore. hunc tu, diua, tuo recubantem corpore sancto circum fusa super suauis ex ore loquellas 40 funde petens placidam Romanis, incluta, pacem; nam neque nos agere hoc patriai tempore iniquo possumus aequo animo nec Memmi clara propago talibus in rebus communi desse saluti. 50 quod superest, vacuas auris animumque sagacem semotum a curis adhibe ueram ad rationem, ne mea dona tibi studio disposta fideli intellecta prius quam sint contempta relinquas. nam tibi de summa caeli ratione deumque</page><page sequence="5">The Proem of Lucretius 205 55 disserere incipiam et rerum primordia pandam, unde omnis natura creet res auctet alatque, quoue eadem rursus natura perempta resoluat; quae nos materiem et genitalia corpora rebus reddunda in ratione uocare et semina rerum 60 appellare suëmus et haec eadem usurpare corpora prima, quod ex Ulis sunt omnia primis. Before we begin to consider this passage a textual problem must be dealt with. The last two words of 50 are not in the manuscripts of Lucretius, but are re covered from a quotation in the Veronese scholia on Georgics 3.3; they are cer tainly genuine, and closely parallelled by 4.912 tenais aures animumque sa gacem, as well as animum sagacem 2.840, animo sagaci 1.402. But who is being addressed? Before this line the manuscripts offer six lines which recur at 2.646 651. They make perfect nonsense of this passage and were deleted by Pontanus and Marullus, rightly (see my discussion in "Quotation, Interpolation, Trans position", Hermathena 143, 1987, 11). They deal with the lack of concern for men on the part of the Epicurean gods, and were originally added in the margin as a sarcastic comment on Lucretius' request for Venus' involvement by a reader who felt precisely the same difficulty about the proem of Lucretius as Sedley (see my initial quotation) and others. This reader was probably identical with the famous interpolator philosophus of Lucretius, who is not to be re garded, as many commentators would like to do, as just a figment; he may have been the same person who added tituli showing knowledge of the text of Epi curus. I do not propose here to waste time on proving something so obvious as the interpolation of these lines; Gale 215-217 rather hesitantly cornes to the same conclusion, and so does M. Deufert, Pseudo-lukrezisches im Lukrez (Ber lin 1996) 36, though instead of postulating a lacuna he prefers to reject the read ing of the Veronese scholia and emend 50 otherwise. Others who also believe in the interpolation of the lines are e.g. Schilling 347-348, W. Schmid, "Altes und Neues zu einer Lukrezfrage" Philol. 93 (1938-1939) 346, P. M. Brown in his commentary (Bristol 1984). It is however worth while to ask why so many scholars continue to accept them. To leave out of considération the low quality of many éditions of Lucretius, a weighty reason is that such scholars are in many cases professional students of philosophy (to name a few, Sedley ll.cc. 290 = 26; K. Kleve, "Lukrez und Venus", Symb. Osl. 41,1966, 86; Clay 94 and 109), and they like to devise ingenious solutions to philosophical problems. Now there is hardly anything which requires so much ingenuity as the defence of textual cor ruptions. Quite a few of what are currently regarded as problems giving scope to philosophical ingenuity are simply corruptions like this; see e.g. the futile (be cause the sentence deals with our means of perceiving the gods, not their sub stance) rétention of ad deos in Cic. De nat. deor. 1.49 as presented by Long and Sedley, The Hellenistic Philosophers (Cambridge 1987) 1.142; 2.148-149, a</page><page sequence="6">206 Edward Courtney book which in a number of cases errs in the rétention of indefensible readings (I hope that Mr Sedley is not by now feeling himself the victim of a persécution). Philosophers must really learn to think seriously about textual criticism; of course they can retort that textual critics should learn more about philosophy. Now to return to my question, who is being addressed in 50? The answer is of course Memmius, but as the text stands, whether 44-49 be présent or absent, that cannot be; this difficulty drove P. Gimpel, "De rerum natura: proemium re stitutum" RCCM 23 (1981) 12-13 to the desperate expedient of taking propago 42 to be vocative. As I explained in Hermathena I.e., quoting parallels, when these lines were incorporated from the margin into the text as if they had been accidentally omitted, they extruded a block of text in which Lucretius turned to address Memmius. The same thing may have happened between 1.145 and 149 (see Deufert 63). Now for the Substantive interprétation. Venus 'effects' (20) the propaga tion of species and 'alone' (21) controls natura rerum, Lucretius now asks her to 'effect' the cessation of warfare, since she 'alone' can give peace to men; i.e. he is still using the forms of traditional religion. This stylistic slant is emphasised by nam...potes31, which inprayers regularly appearsafter a request (Norden 152 154 and on Aen. 6.117; Appel 153); the turn is repeated in 41 after another re quest. Warfare is the province of Mars, and he is enslaved by love for Venus. He is described as reclining on her lap, and described in very précisé physical terms; his neck is teres (in a phrase which Lucretius took from Cicero Aratea fr. 9.5, where it is appropriately applied to a snake; quite likely, as Ο. Skutsch, Annais of Ennius, Oxford 1985, 783 = uestigia ix argues, the phrase was applied in En nius to the infant Romulus or Remus bending back to suckle on the wolf), i.e. he is like a youthful human lover (see Munro's note), his mouth hangs open with desire, etc. The whole description is so pictorial that Lucretius certainly intends us to think of artistic représentations of the scene; see the gern listed in Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae s.v. Ares 384 and illustrated ibid. II 2.413. Venus then is entreated to ask Mars, who like her is a divine ancestor of Rome, for peace (already associated with her in 31), a request which links Lucretius and Memmius; for without peace Lucretius (nos) cannot 'attend to the business in hand' (agere hoc, cf. 4.969 nos agere hoc autem et naturam quae rere rerum), and Memmius has to engage in politics. When the text résumés, he is being exhorted to apply uacuas auris animumque... semotum a curis to uera ratio, and not to dismiss what Lucretius has to offer through préjudice. This raises the question of the relationship between Lucretius and Memmius. In his youth the Epicurean Patron attempted to ingratiate himself with him (Cic. Ad fam. 13.1.2), from which no conclusion whatsoever can be drawn about interest or lack of interest in Epicureanism on Memmius' part; later in the same letter (dated to 51 B.C.) Cicero indicates (§ 4) that mockery of Epicureanism by Memmius would not be surprising, from which we must infer, as we could in any</page><page sequence="7">The Proem of Lucretius 207 case from his intention to demolish the ruins of Epicurus' house, that Lucretius did not make a convert of him. When Lucretius in 1.103 expresses the fear that Memmius may 'desert' Epicureanism, that is on the hopeful assumption that he will first have been converted to it by this poem. In short there is no good reason to suppose that Lucretius chose him as dedicatee for anything but social reasons and literary convention; in the poem he functions merely as a passive récipient at whom advice and information can be directed. just as Pausanias apparently functioned in Empedocles; with 50 cf. Empedocles Β 1 Diels-Kranz = 4 M. R. Wright, Empedocles (New Häven 1981) = 13 Β. Inwood, The Poem of Em pedocles (Toronto 1992), and Β 17 = 8 Wright = 25 Inwood. 14sqq. When in 1.141 Lucretius speaks of the sperata uoluptas /suauis amicitiae with Memmius, he is taking advantage of the semantic range of the word amicitia, which can em brace the sort of friendship so important to an Epicurean as well as various rela tionships in Roman society, including the type which obtained between Mae cenas on the one hand and Vergil and Horace on the other. I will recall I. Hil berg's observation (WS 21, 1899, 299) that 4.1015-1019 form the acrostich MEMMI, but like Hilberg himself I regard this as purely accidentai. At this point you, the reader whom I have envisaged, are beginning to wonder if you have been cheated into buying a poem entitled DE RERUM NA TURA, since so far this looks to be not a rationalistic poem about physics, like those entitled Περί φύσεως which you have read. The next lines (54-61), which outline the atomic theory that Lucretius is going to expound, begin to reassure you, but still with a tinge of ambiguity in the wording of 58-60. Who is 'we'? Is it, like nos in 41, just another way of saying Ί'? Or does it mean Ί and the other members of the school to which I belong'? Lucretius probably did not mean the answer to be apparent to you at this point; the singular use of the first person plural is so promiscuous in Latin that one cannot take the preceding mea (52) and incipiam... pandam (55) as pointing to a distinction. Finally in 62 sqq. with the denunciation of religion the poem with no more ambiguity gets on a track of the général type which the title had made you expect. It is then apparent that you need to re-evaluate the proem. In such circumstances one can sometimes revise one's understanding of earlier passages in a work during the process of linear reading (an opération which we regularly perform with motion pictures), but for the sake of clarity of exposition let us suppose that in this case you read on to the end and postpone the re-evaluation. When you come back to the proem you are now in possession of informa tion which you did not have the first time round. This raises a point of literary theory to which sufficient weight is not always given. In Auctor &amp; Actor (Berke ley 1985) John J. Winkler points out that two kinds of reading have to co-exist (see in particular pp. 10-14). One is the sequential or heuristic, in which things are revealed in stages; the other is hermeneutic, when we possess ail that we need to know in order to interpret features in the text as they arise. The topic is discussed from a theoretical viewpoint, mainly focusing on prose fiction, by</page><page sequence="8">208 Edward Courtney Matei Calinescu in Rereading (New Häven 1993), from which I take two quota tions. "Virtually unnoticed has been the fact that the very possibility of a poetics of reading is premised on the perspective of rereading, more precisely on the paradoxical situation that the most enjoyable ways in which a text can be read (... the conventions to be taken into account, the range of legitimate interpréta tions) can be fully determined only once the first reading is over" (p. 112). "Re reading and the characteristic absorption that accompanies it strive for an inter prétation of the text in terms of a complété hermeneutic system in which the sig nificance of each part is seen in the light of the whole and that of the whole in the light of each part" (p. 168). There are also a few remarks on the subject by Wayne C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago 21983) 284-285 under the heading Mystification. Relevant too, especially since the discussion relates to non-narrative poetry, are some of the comments in H. R. Jauss, Toward an Aes thetic of Réception (tr. T. Bahti, Minneapolis 1982) 139-148, though he is not centrally concerned with the same issue as I am. That the Romans were acquainted with this process of re-reading can be shown from Quintilian 10.1.20-21, which I adduce in the Loeb translation: "Nor must we study" [the whole text] "merely in parts, but must read through the whole work from cover to cover and then read it afresh, a precept which applies more especially to Speeches, whose merits are often deliberately disguised. For the orator frequently préparés his audience for what is to corne, dissembles and sets a trap for them and makes remarks at the opening of his speech which will not have their füll force tili the conclusion. Con sequently what he says will often seem comparatively ineffective where it actually occurs, since we do not realise his motive and it will be necessary to re-read the speech after we have acquainted ourselves with all that it contains". You, my envisaged reader, with some assistance from me have just read the proem heuristically; now let us read it hermeneutically. You now know that in the Epicurean view Venus certainly exists, but that she cannot possibly be Aeneadum genetrix in a literal sense; as for the second half of the line, which at first seemed to be saying something as non-technical as Plato Philebus 12b, you have read in 2.172 dux uitae dia uoluptas, and from your général cultural knowl edge you know the importance of ηδονή to Epicureans. "The word 'uoluptas' identifies Venus as the personification of the chief good in the Epicurean Sys tem: Pleasure (ηδονή)" (Ε. J. Kenney, Lucretius, Greece and Rome Surveys 11, Oxford 1977,13). So you see that Venus in philosophical terms is a symbol of an impersonal force which governs the whole world (the phrase just quoted from 2.172 is the subject of 173 res per Veneris blanditur saecla (sc. mortales) pro pagent:; with 19 blandum amorem compare the fréquent occurrence in Lucretius of blanda uoluptas), and that she is 'mother of the sons of Aeneas' only for the</page><page sequence="9">The Proem of Lucretius 209 literary purpose of linking her with 'the son of Memmius' and the contemporary political troubles which distract both poet and dedicatee; she can counteract them by providing tranquilla pax (31), which you have met in 2.1093 as an at tribute of the blessed life of the gods and in 6.78 as an appropriate human reac tion, in place of fear, to intimations of the divine. Accordingly she is to request from Mars placida pax (40) for the Romani (that is the Aeneadae); this too you have met as characteristic of the life of the gods in 6.73 (near one of the passages just referred to). It is of course central to Epicurean theology that the blessed life of the gods is to serve as a model for men, and you will easily recognize άταραξία under these phrases with pax. The hymn-formulae analysed above can be read as suggesting that ηδονή and αταραξία have displaced the tradi tional gods (note the form of 'Du-Prädikation' applied to Epicurus in 3.9-10). You will also put a new slant on 24 te sociam studeo scribendis uersibus esse. You have been reminded at 2.655-660 of the familiar poetic metonymy whereby e.g. mars can Substitute for bellum (cf. the only occurrence of his name outside the proem in Lucretius at 5.1304), and are now moved to read this line as a wish for the poem to possess uenus in the sense of uenustas (cf. Classen ll.cc. 103 = 357 with addendum 373). Moreover you will have read in 6.94 an invoca tion to Calliope as requies hominum diuumque uoluptas, from which you will draw the rétrospective inference that Venus - uoluptas is replacing the Muse traditionally invoked at the beginning of a poem as providing inspiration. As you read the poem for the first time, you observed that at 1.716 sqq., despite disagreement, Empedocles was spoken of with considérable respect. You will also have been much reminded of Empedocles both in specific pas sages and in the général style. Now that you are alert to the fact that you must see more in the Venus of the prologue than a traditional anthropomorphic deity, a natural next step is to think of the Empedoclean Aphrodite who is also Φιλότης and Γηθοσύνη, that is uoluptas (B 17.20-24 Diels-Kranz = 8 Wright = 25 Inwood), the force which brings the four elements (these of course will not appear in Lucretius; I am not persuaded by D. J. Furley, "Variations on Thèmes from Empedocles in Lucretius' Proem" BICS17,1970,55, to see a reference to fiery ether in 1.9, nor by Sedley 282 = 17 to see one in 5 also) together in création (Β 21 DK = 14 Wright = 26 Inwood) of trees, humans, animais, birds, fish and gods too. This is very close to the role played by Venus in Lucretius, with two différences. First, after hominum 1, Lucretius avoids speaking of humanity in 4-20, whereas men are présent not only in Empedocles but also in a very similar (Munro on 2-3; Gale 209) invocation to Aphrodite in Horn, hymn 4.3-5; this is because, as I explain below, Mars is intended to fill this gap. Second, Lucretius here makes no mention of gods because he does not yet want to disclose his view of them; Empedocles' mention of them provides that philosopher with a means of incorporating the traditional gods into his System, and perhaps the alert reader of Lucretius will be prompted to think how Venus too can be inter preted in novel fashion.</page><page sequence="10">210 Edward Courtney When you come to 21, you are remmded of another Pre-Socratic philoso pher whom you must associate with Empedocles, namely Parmenides; both are the author of a poem which (whatever name the writer gave to it) you know under the title of Περί Φύσεως. The phrase of which you are reminded (despite the currency of the image of god as helmsman) is Β 12 δαίμων ή πάντα κυβερνά; this daemon is she who unités male and female (Plut. Amatorius 13.756e suggests that Aphrodite is specifically meant). That fits the général con text in Lucretius, and indeed perhaps 'Aphrodite' was a way of designating this aspect of bringing things together in Stoic theology (E. Asmis, "Lucretius' Venus and Stoic Zeus" Hermes 110,1982,460). You will also note that Venus is taking over the role allotted in the hymn of Cleanthes to Zeus, who (35) πάντα κυβερνά (cf. 2 πάντα κυβερνών). This hymn is brought into relationship with the Lucretian prologue by D. Clay, "Greek Physis and Epicurean Physiologia" TAPA 100 (1969) 35 and Asmis I.e.; naturally enough it shows similarities in structure and style to the hymnodic features which I have analysed in Lucretius (see my note on the hymn of Tiberianus in Fragmentary Latin Poets, 1993,433). I draw particular attention to σου δίχα (15), which expresses one half of the an tithesis which I have discussed above, though Cleanthes prefers to express the positive side not in a prepositional phrase. I am not certain whether the hymn was quite prominent enough in Lucretius' mind to allow us to suppose that in 4 with per te he was putting Venus - uoluptas in the place of the Zeus whose ob lique cases the Stoics etymologised from διά (see again Fraenkel on Aesch. A g. 1485; a hint in this direction in Asmis 466). This much for Venus; what about Mars? It is tempting to suppose that as Aphrodite represents Empedoclean Love, so Ares represented Strife, but in fact there is no evidence for this, though it is sometimes maintained (e.g. by A. Dalzell in Cambridge History ofAncient Literature, 1982,2.227). G. S. Kirk/ J. E. Raven, Pre-Socratic Philosophers (Cambridge 1957) 349 saw a hint of the idea, but in the second édition (1983, with M. Schofield) 318 tacitly abandoned the contention; some late writers, interpreting the song of Demodocus allegori cally, draw an analogy with the Empedoclean conception ([Plut.] De Homero 2.101, p. 48 Kindstrand, and Heraclitus, Alleg. Horn. 69; it has become tradi tional, though Sedley 291 n. 64 = 27 n. 98 shows proper reserve, to refer to Eu stathius on Od. 8.367, but he has not a word to say about Empedocles), but none states unequivocally that it was in Empedocles. It is more fruitful to compare Mars with the human lovers about whom you, my envisaged reader, have read in Book iv; so Gale 222 "He perhaps symbolizes disturbing curae... This would explain why his passion for Venus is represented in terms of the romantic love condemned in the finale to book 4", with verbal parallels (especially the use of uulnus) in n. 65. Gale 83 n. 316 also comments on Mars' adjective teres, to which I have drawn attention above. Mars therefore lacks Epicurean tranquillity and can attain to it only by union with Venus - uoluptas. So, as Venus represents not only Empedoclean Love (and other things too) but also αταραξία, Mars repre</page><page sequence="11">The Proem of Lucretius 211 sents two potent forces which can disturb that, war and love, and needs to be smothered by Venus (tuo recubantem corpore sancto /circum fusa super). Only so can Lucretius achieve an aequus animus 42, i.e. άταραςία; his desire for this indicates the detachment which the Epicurean sage should ideally possess. As for the ambiguity about 'we' in 60, you will now have encountered first 1.458 haec solid sumus... euenta uocare, which raises exactly the same problem as here; is Lucretius employing current Epicurean terminology (so A. Dalzell, Criücism of Didacüc Poetry, Toronto 1996, 79 and 180 n. 18 claims, though on inconclusive grounds), or introducing his own terminology? But later you will have been in no doubt about 4.30 quae rerum simulacra uocamus, because this renders Epicurus himself, Ep. ad Herod. 46 τούτους δέ τούς τύπους είδωλα προσαγορεύομεν. So on your second reading you will understand the passage in the prologue and that at 1.458 to mean 'which the Epicurean school to which I belong dénotés by these Latin équivalents of Greek terms'. There is one piece of evidence to confirm that Lucretius had at his disposai at least some Latin technical terminology to render Epicurean concepts. Cicero (Ac. post. 1.6) tells us that the obscure Epicurean writer Amafinius, who, as is suggested by TuscA.6-1 (see C. J. Castner, Prosopography οf Roman Epicureans, Frankfurt a.M. 1988,7), was doubtless earlier than Lucretius, used the word corpuscula to refer to atoms, as Lucretius himself does at 2.529; in the four other occurrences of the word in him it means atomic nuclei. I should perhaps mention that Deufert 228sq. wishes to delete 58-61 on grounds which seem insubstantial to me. It is, I hope, apparent that no simphstic approach to this proem suffices. We must not come to it determined to find one all-embracing and exclusive inter prétation. We must not apply to it any one method of reading. If we do either of these things we are going to deprive Lucretius of the tour de force by which he has kept the reader on tenterhooks for about (this word because we cannot quantify what he wrote after 43) fifty lines. Above all we must not fall into an error which nowadays in similar situations afflicts the practitioners of many spe cialisms within classical studies, that of seeing ourselves interested as students only of either philosophy or literature.</page></plain_text>
