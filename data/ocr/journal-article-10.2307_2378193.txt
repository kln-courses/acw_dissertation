<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUGUSTE COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY MABEL V. WILSON There is no idea in Comte's positive philosophy which needs discussion and clarification more than does the concep- tion of humanity. In order to make progress in such a study we must lay aside at once the vague, popular notion that hu- manity connotes human nature in the mass, or a vast, dim aggregate of people located nowhere in particular. We must also guard against the assumption of pious minds that hu- manity is entirely a religious conception, in short, a Great Be- ing, who is but another name for God. Littre and others have encouraged the view that all the ideas in the Systeme de Poli- tique Positive, and in Comte's later treatises in general, have significance only for followers of positivism as a religious cult. This is not true. The conception can with much profit be stud- ied from a purely philosophical and ethical standpoint. It is our purpose, then, to ignore the common notions, re- ligious or otherwise, concerning humanity, or at least to subor- dinate them as far as possible, in order to investigate the particular philosophical meaning which is attached to this term in positivism. We must not hastily assume, however, that Comte was the sole originator of this conception. His predecessors had developed social theories, which, if not iden- tical with the positive doctrine of humanity, certainly bear a close relation to it. Turgot, Condorcet, and Saint-Simon, for example, had in their writings popularized the idea of human civilization as a continuous, growing whole. And Rousseau's theories, too, were based on the assumption that mankind constitutes a unit, for he advocated the return to nature for all men alike. Furthermore, the Greek notion of society-as an organism, and of man as possessing an inherent social qual- ity, had again come into vogue. All such doctrines, current in the early nineteenth century, represent certain aspects of the 88</page><page sequence="2">COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY 89 groundwork out of which the positive conception of humanity developed. Although they may seem to us merely vague, or even fanciful, speculations on mankind, civilization, and so- ciety, Comte was wise enough to appreciate their full force and to utilize them. Pascal, Leibniz, and Condorcet, in particular, furnished valuable source material for the positive theory of humanity. Pascal conceived of the whole past development of the indi- vidual and of the race as "converging" toward the present. Leibniz helped to clarify this obscure notion of human prog- ress by establishing a definite relation of dependence between the future and the present. Then Condorcet contributed the important conception of the human species as one people. All these partial truths Comte undertook to develop, organize, and incorporate into his positive theory of humanity. Al- though he refused to acknowledge all of his indebtedness to his predecessors, he did take cognizance of the various antici- pations which we have just mentioned, and furthermore sug- gests that even primitive man in some of his polytheistic be- liefs had given intimation of the positive doctrine.' In fact, a sociological study of early group life is of real value in deter- mining the origins of the idea of humanity. The simplest and most spontaneous form of human association is the family, in which there exists the germ of all social unity and progress, and the same principle of love and harmony which is at work in humanity. But it is not our purpose here to examine in detail the source materials of positivism or to trace how the doctrine of humanity developed historically, for it is a sufficiently diffi- cult task to analyze the meaning of the conception as it func- tioned in Comte's thought. All the positive treatises, the earlier as well as the later, contain references to humanity, and there is every reason to suppose that Comte would have made the idea still clearer had he lived to write his intended works on ethics. In fact we may regard this doctrine as the 'Systeme de Politique Positive (Paris, i851-54), II, 95; IV, 29-30.</page><page sequence="3">90 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS very basis of the positive sociology and ethics, and, if inter- preted properly, as the means of unifying positivism as a whole.2 Doubtless such a reference to humanity as a philo- sophical principle of co-ordination and unity will seem very "abstract" and generally undesirable to the religious posi- tivists. It should be recalled, however, that Comte never made a separation of his religion from his philosophy, but always regarded the former as an opportunity for the sym- bolic representation of his ideas. The scientific positivists, on the other hand, would natur- ally question the efficacy of humanity as a coordinating prin- ciple of positivism, because they assign this function to Com- te's hierarchical classification of the sciences according to their increasing concreteness or decreasing abstractness. But a study of the Cours de Philosophie Positive, where this means of unifying knowledge is attempted, reveals that the result was not so satisfactory as had been anticipated, because the treatise appeared to be an artificial linking together of various groups of scientific facts in an encyclopedic fashion rather than a systematic, unitary organization of the sciences. The positive sociology shows Comte taking a fresh start on his problem of achieving l'esprit d'ensemble, but it also fails to unify human knowledge completely, since it is so clearly di- vided into two departments, the social statics and the so- cial dynamics. Of course we are told that there is a comple- mentary relation between the two, expressed in the principle that progress is the development of order. But as a matter of fact, more time is spent on distinguishing what is statical from what is dynamical than on finding their points of connec- tion. So, although sociology had been hailed as the high point from which all the other sciences could be viewed in their proper relations, we find that it must be defined as the "sci- ence of humanity" if it is really to exercise this important function. Doubtless there is a general impression that in positivism 2Systeme, I, 6-7, La Synthese Subjective (Paris, I900), I, 2, 35-36.</page><page sequence="4">COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY 9I the terms "sociology" and "science of humanity" are synony- mous, and one cannot deny that often they may thus be used, for the line of demarcation between them is difficult to draw. In general, however, sociology may be said to resemble the natural sciences, having as its aim an investigation of social and political phenomena, while the "science of humanity" has the broader, more theoretical aim of setting the sciences in their true perspective. The latter is normative in nature and more akin to ethical theory, and presents sociological truths in their more spiritual aspects. Even a superficial study of this problem shows that humanity is pre-eminently a spirit- ual and ethical reality, though this is not to say that Comte means to give it a transcendental existence outside of na- ture. As in the case of ordinary human individuals, the very existence of humanity depends upon external, physical condi- tions, and its activities reveal the same principle of universal order which is exhibited in natural processes as well as in hu- man affairs.3 Otherwise there could be no science of humanity. This fundamental harmony between humanity and the natural universe is its first characteristic that we can recog- nize. The second is the inner unity, or "solidarity" of human- ity, which causes it to function as a unit, and have a definite course of history in time. This last-mentioned attribute of historical continuity is of distinct importance, for Comte thus connects humanity with his theory of progress, representing it in a teleological manner as "the chief impelling force (moteur) behind men's destinies."4 The quality of solidarity is, in the language of the positive sociology, the static aspect of hu- manity, while continuity is its dynamic characteristic. At last Comte has found a way of coordinating order and progress by showing them to be subordinate to a larger conception, humanity. Since harmony with nature represents the relation of humanity to the natural sciences, we see that this concep- tion embodies not merely the sociological principles, but all a Catkchisne Positiviste, Pecant ed. (Paris, n.d.), p. 68. 4Systf'me, Il, 364.</page><page sequence="5">92 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS the essential aspects of positivism. This is the sense in which the doctrine of humanity is a means of co-ordinating and uni- fying the positive philosophy. Such a method of study is so purely abstract and technical that it may seem little more than a manipulation of terminolo- gy. Granting that humanity has the attributes of solidarity, continuity, and harmony with nature, and that it serves as a principle of co-ordination, we must undertake a more detailed analysis of the conception and of the terms by which it is de- fined. Throughout the several treatises Comte often compares humanity to various kinds of unified wholes, especially or- ganisms. But this is hardly sufficient as a means of clarifica- tion, for a great number of social and political theorists have used the same idea of a "social organism," leaving its mean- ing undefined. Comte clearly refers to a biological organism, for in making his analogy he attributes to humanity the char- acteristic of a living body which develops from a single nucle- us, has a spontaneous growth, and possesses different organs for its functions.' It is in this sense, rather than the religious, that humanity is a great being which has the characteristics of an individual, namely, inner organization, or solidarity, and a continuity of growth in time. Comte goes on to elaborate this analogy by comparing the stages of man's history, theological, metaphysical, and posi- tive, to the infancy, adolescence, and maturity of humanity. He further develops this similarity to an individual by point- ing out that the classes of society, priests, working people, and women, correspond to the intellectual, volitional, and effec- tive aspects of human nature. This comparison very clearly reminds one of the Platonic parallelism between politics and psychology. But Comte recognizes that the analogy between humanity and a biological organism, or human individuality, must not be pushed too far. Humanity is vastly more com- 'Cours de Philosophic Positive (Paris, i830-42), IV, 409; V, 13-15; Syst~me, 1, 421; II, 6o, 451.</page><page sequence="6">COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY 93 plex in its organization than is an individual life, although they do have certain points of resemblance. The method of analogy can never give final satisfaction. There is some value in the comparison, however, since it reveals Comte's conviction that individual and social life cannot be radically different: any theory of the individual mind must also ac- count for its relations with other minds.6 So, in a certain sense, humanity is human nature writ large. There are various expressions and phrases used in the positive philosophy to describe and clarify the notion of hu- manity, and elaborate the theory that it is an organism. These are often obscure and fanciful, such as "a vast and timeless social unit," or "the center of human unity."7 More signifi- cant, however, is the use of the term ensemble, especially since there is no exact French equivalent for the English word "whole." From the very beginning of Comte's work, ensemble is a favorite term, e.g., in the phrase la point de vue d'en- semble, as well as in connection with humanity. Just what does ensemble mean? Does the unity of an ensemble reside merely in the mind of the observer, or is it independently in- herent in the structure of the ensemble itself? Descriptive terms, such as "collective" and "collective life" seem to sug- gest that when speaking of humanity as an ensemble, Comte means that it is a vast aggregate. This interpretation is en- couraged by the remark that the Great Being makes a con- stant effort "to conserve the union of the separable elements of which it is made up."8 However plausible this definition of the meaning of en- semble may appear, even with quotations as a basis, it was openly rejected by Comte, who held that any view of society as a mere "agglomeration" of individuals in a fortuitous and transitory union is an ideal characteristic of the theological 6Systeme, II, 9, I, 277; Discours sur l'Esprit Positif (Paris, I909), p. 7I. 7Cours, IV, 559; Systeme, II, 62. 8 Cours, IV, I78; V, 68, I5. Frederic Harrison inserts this interpretation in his translation of Systeme (London, i875), II, 369. Cf. Systeme, I, 4I7.</page><page sequence="7">94 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS stage of man's mental development.9 "The disintegration of humanity into isolated individuals," he stated, "is an irra- tional as well as an immoral analysis, which tends to dissolve social existence without explaining it. It is as vicious in so- ciology as is, in biology, the chemical decomposition of the in- dividual into irreducible molecules, a separation which never takes place during life."'0 Comte goes so far in his opposition to reducing humanity to an aggregate of individuals that he declares that man does not even exist in his own right: only humanity so exists. We may conclude, then, that the common view of an en- semble as an aggregate of separate elements is not adequate as a definition of humanity. And it is very confusing that both ensemble and "organism" should be used without any clear definition of either. Comte's conscious attempts to elucidate the notion of humanity in a philosophical way can, therefore, hardly be said to be successful. We may be able to make more progress in studying the conception by a more direct examina- tion of what sort of human individuals humanity is made up. Needless to say, the common identification of humanity with all of mankind or the human race in general is not made by Comte, or else we should not have the problem of discussing the doctrine at all. According to the positive view, humanity includes only a- certain portion of mankind as its members. More interesting still is the idea that humanity is not merely a component mass of members, but rather that it has mem- bers. These individuals are the means, the organs, by which humanity acts, and are indispensable instruments; but there is a certain aspect of humanity which is independent of them. The question then arises as to just what humanity apart from its members, in this detached sense, can mean, and this is in- deed an enigma. Perhaps it signifies mind ('esprit) in that broad historical and social sense which is so often used in posi- 'Discours, p. 87; Systeme, I, 4II. 'Systve'me, II. i~o-8i.</page><page sequence="8">COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY 95 tivism." Since there is no discussion on this point, however, we must content ourselves with examining the problem of who are the members. Comte declares that humanity consists essentially of the dead; life is a period of probation, during which individuals may prove or fail to prove that they are worthy of being incor- porated into humanity. This theory of gaining immortality by deeds and influence on the lives of living persons, thereby remaining in their memories and becoming part of the social heritage, has been so popularized since Comte's day that few of us remember that it was a part of the positive doctrine of humanity. The dead play a very real part, according to posi- tivism, and as time goes on the living are more and more ruled by them. This, of course, is only a more striking way of as- serting the tremendous force of history on present events, and that the pressure of the past is so great that we cannot oppose it, but only understand it. Needless to say, all historical facts are not on the same level of importance. Not everything that has happened is an integral and necessary link in the course of events; and like- wise not all who have lived become members of humanity. Comte very clearly declares, "Humanity is not composed of all individuals or human groups, past present, and future, in- discriminately brought into an aggregate (agglomere's). No real whole can be brought about, except from elements that are essentially "associable." The Great Being is formed only by the concurrence, either in time or in space, of lives that are "assimilable," or, in other words, sufficiently capable of being incorporated. Those who are mere encumbrances on the race are not members of humanity."' In another passage human- ity is defined as "the continuous whole of converging beings" (l'ensemble continu des 6tres convergents). In short, all ' G. H. Lewes, in his book Comtes Philosophy of the Sciences (London, i887), p. 23, suggests such a view by asserting that the evolution of humanity corresponds to the evolution of thought. 12Systeme, I, 4.II 13 Ibid., LV, 30.</page><page sequence="9">96 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS men are born children of humanity, but few become its serv- ants; some are merely passive, digesting machines, or para- sites. Like Carlyle, Comte had a profound admiration for the great men of history. He realized that one of the chief dan- gers of the doctrine of humanity lies in its tendency to over- shadow its individual members, and perhaps for this reason sought to appreciate and recognize the distinctive personali- ties who have been creative leaders of civilization. For this purpose the positivist calendar was organized, and became an important feature of the religious cult. Positivists revered the men of genius thus listed and deemed worthy of the honor by their master, almost worshiping them as the Roman Catholics do their saints. What are the characteristic qualities of these great men whom Comte has specially chosen? In order to dis- cover his criterion of personal greatness, and hence of mem- bership in humanity, we must determine what is meant by lives that are "sufficiently assimilable," and beings that "con- verge." At the outset of this inquiry it is somewhat surprising to learn that the higher animals may become members of hu- manity, since Comte considers that they are capable of noble, voluntary services to men, although he admits that they have no consciousness of performing a social function. Of course the faithfulness and courage of dogs in rescue cases, for ex- ample, seems to bear a real resemblance to human actions that we call good. It is quite a different matter, however, to go on to say that animals actually realize the ethical principle, "Live for others" (Vivre pour autrui), which is the first re- quirement for membership in humanity.14 Altruism, then, is the means of achieving incorporation into the Great Being. But this must not be interpreted in a petty way as meaning playing, the lady bountiful, or the good Samaritan. A member of humanity must be a great soul, and in transcending egoism give expression to the universal, eter- "Systlme, IV, 37.</page><page sequence="10">COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY 97 nally significant, or "social" possibilities of human nature. Civilization advances at a rate corresponding to the degree of dominance of altruism over egoism which we can achieve. Some might contend that every human life exhibits some al- truism, however infinitesimal, and therefore all can claim a place in humanity. But a member must do more than this; his life must reveal a preponderance of altruism over egoism, for this is what a real advance in civilization means. Only that part of a life which does so contribute has eternal mean- ing. In other words, humanity assimilates from each individ- ual only that part of his life which has significance from the point of view of the whole."5 Comte does not demand any uni- formity in the type of contributions which are made, but only in the fact of disinterestedness. Altruistic lives in this sense are homogeneous, they fit in with one another, or are "con- vergent," and are "assimilable" because they and they alone are capable of incorporation into humanity. The emphasis on the altruistic life as the indispensable condition for membership in humanity is only another way of stating the doctrine that the individual must be subordi- nated to society. If Comte had shown clearly that there is a fundamental harmony or identity between the purposes of humanity as a whole and the ideals and needs of individuals, then he might have justly maintained that morality consists in contributing to the good of humanity."6 But this he never does, and the idea that the individual must never be used for a purpose which does not include his own good is not given ex- pression in the positive philosophy. Followers of Kant were wiser in recognizing this human need for a consciousness of self-expression and self-realization, for while they, too, held that participation in a common, shareable good is essential, they also saw that this good must be one which expresses per- sonal, as well as social, ideals. Comte fails to see this. He in- terprets the ethical meaning and goal of individual life in 6 Systeme, 11, 62. 6 Cf. T. H. Green, Prolegomena to Ethics (Oxford, i906), pp. 210-29.</page><page sequence="11">98 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS terms of humanity, but does not recognize that the converse of this truth is just as valid and significant. One reason why humanity appears to transcend individual lives and to treat men as its servants lies in the fact that it crystallized into an object of religious worship. Even for Comte, not to speak of his followers, it was too difficult to de- velop the conception of humanity along purely ethical lines. While a symbolic Great Being may be of value in establishing a religion for the masses, there is in it very little contribution to a philosophical theory of the common good. We find, for example, that the Great Being is often described as kind and sympathetic toward his servants, who, in turn, are brought into unity through devotion, and so are made better and hap- pier. Thus taking Comte at his worst, we see that he finds the same paternalistic relation between humanity and the indi- vidual which is characteristic of the old theistic idea of God. Unfortunately, his attempts at a more truly philosophical in- terpretation are too full of obscurity to be of value. ,We have seen that not only is this question of the relation of the individual to humanity unsuccessfully treated, but the very nature and constitution of humanity, whether "organ- ism" or ensemble, is left uncertain. No doubt this confusion explains why so little study has been made of this part of the positive philosophy. These problems have been largely ig- nored, and understanding of the conception of humanity has come through insight rather than careful analysis. Perhaps, however, future study will reveal more of Comte's meaning than we can now discover. Notwithstanding the undeveloped nature of his theories, they were of distinct value in pointing the way to a new social and political type of ethical inquiry. The positivist's opposition to the abstract individualism of the eighteenth century, and insistence on the social nature of morality based on the doctrine of man's inherently social na- ture, have proved fruitful in developing a broader conception of ethics than was hitherto possible. Comte, however, stressed the idea of humanity too much</page><page sequence="12">COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY 99 without giving sufficient recognition to the human individual and the necessity of his conscious self-realization. Hegel, who has recently so often been accused of exalting the state above its members, and making it a mystical entity, is, in comparison with Comte, quite a champion of the individual. An examina- tion of the Philosophie des Reckts reveals the theory that the state is the ultimate form of human organization, and both an actual and a symbolic embodiment of concrete freedom, in which personall individuality, and its particular interests, as found in the family and civic community, have their complete development."'7 While this language is not the latest philo- sophical jargon, we cannot afford to ignore the fact that Hegel saw that the good of society as a whole must include the good of the individual, and this is more than Comte achieved. In this connection it is interesting to compare the positiv- ist with the Hegelian doctrine of rights. Comte was so hostile to the eighteenth-century insistence on rights that he went to the other extreme and recognized only man's duties to human- ity, ignoring rights altogether. This, of course, is a necessary corollary of the theory of the individual's subordination to humanity. For only in a limited sense are individual members separate or independent, because they have ethical signifi- cance only in so far as they embody the spirit of humanity as a whole. So the rights and duties of mankind, which had pre- viously been so carefully distinguished, were in positivism merged into the notion of one's duty as a member of human- ity. Hegel, on the other hand, had kept the old distinction be- tween rights and duties, but attempted to correlate them justly."8 This does not embroil him in the difficulties of ex- plaining just how rights can disappear in the supreme notion of duty to humanity, which, of course, is a question Comte never clearly answers. In fact, he is so absorbed in contem- plating humanity that he is scarcely conscious that there might be any difficulty about the free development of indi- 1THegel, Philosophy of Right, Dyde trans.

Philosophy of Right, pp. 249-50.</page><page sequence="13">I00 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS vidual charachter and destiny, or that he needs to reveal how the good of humanity can be identified with all possible per- sonal aims that are good. So the problem of an intimately per- sonal realization of ethical ideals, whether of right or what not, is ignored by Comte. To this challenge to positivism as failing to encourage, or even recognize, the necessity of an individual's having his own ideals and striving to attain them, positivists no doubt would make a number of responses. Few would care to accept the theory of subordination at its face value, but many would deny that such an interpretation of Comte need be made. The latter might contend that humanity, instead of being regarded as a super-individual entity, is merely an anthropomorphic conception, a greatly magnified or symbolic self, and that life in accord with its purposes is really life in accord with per- sonal aims and desires.19 But this makes humanity mean mere- ly human nature, and this most certainly was not Comte's idea. Study of the positive philosophy does not reveal an ex- alted egoism, but simply an altruism that is too abstract to admit of reconciliation with the fact of personal ethical con- sciousness and achievement. Frederic Harrison, writing on The Ethic of Humanism, takes cognizance of Comte's confusion in dealing with this problem, and in his own, we might say neo-positivist, theory he attempts to make room for the ethical significance of indi- viduality. He asserts: "The sympathetic social life is the life of self, in a true sense. We do not cease to be ourselves by lov- ing, thinking, and working for Humanity. We develop, real- ize, manifest ourselves. . . . .Why ought we to live for Hu- manity? Because we must. We are so constituted by nature. Because we live only by Humanity, in Humanity and through Humanity."20 This is a development of Comte's thought at its best, which rather resembles the Hegelian doctrine that the state is the objective spirit and the individual has his truth, real existence, and ethical status in being a member of it. Such 9J. H. Bridges, Essays and Addresses (London, 1907), p. 86. Frederic Harrison, On Society (London, i918), p. i6.</page><page sequence="14">COMTE'S CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY iOI an interpretation, however, is very clearly not the original Comtean doctrine. Naturally enough, some positivists seek to put their master's ideas in as favorable a light as possible, and to develop those aspects of his doctrine which are most fruitful. But the meaning of individuality and membership in humanity is a real problem, and it is doubtful whether any one can interpret Comte's statements in such a manner as to make them appear as a basis for a theory of the individual's right to a life expressive of his own ethical ideals. Before ending our discussion of this point, however, we must recognize that in a sense there is a positive theory of ethical perfection, for Comte wanted to harmonize all the in- terdependent aspects of human life, the affective, the intel- lectual, and the active, or volitional, thus achieving a unity of man's character.' This synthetic state, he believes, can be brought about only by concrete realization of the principle of love or altruism, and co-operation in humanity as a whole. We must note, however, that Comte understands human life and man in a generalized, abstract sense, never as concrete indi- viduality.22 The subordination of the individual to humanity is an idea that inevitably shows itself in positivism, no matter what the starting-point may be. Indeed, it is declared that a man cannot even be known at all except through his relation to humanity. And the only real means of an individual at- taining unity of character or life is by participation in the per- fect order of humanity itself, because harmony within any of the parts of a whole depends upon the harmony of the whole. So we see that there can be no individual good life. In positivism all the stress is laid on the social well-being and progress, but it can be seriously questioned whether this posi- tion is any more valid than that of the old individualism, to which it stands in antithesis. While it is true that all morality must be social in nature, it, is also true that the individual realization of a good life is a necessary -condition for the har- ' Cf. System, IV, 45, 46.

Great personalities, by their very nature, cannot be bound down by a sense of subservience to humanity, for greatness consists in the persistence to realize one's potentialities of mind and character in an untrammeled way. This whole difficulty in determining the relation between an individual's life and the purposes of humanity might have been avoided if Comte had held that humanity is merely syn- onymous with civilization, or the accumulated social heritage. For this ever increasing heritage, which results from the ac- tivity of mind in it8 broad, historical sense, could easily have been considered as a unified developing whole without a per- sonal character. Humanity, thus interpreted, would never have become a Great Being, demanding servility from man- kind, but would have been another word for the spirit (Geist) of progress, or civilization. Such a conception is just as ex- pressive of the intellectual and ethical possibilities of the in- dividual as it is of those of society as a whole; indeed, we might say that, in such a theory, individual potentialities would receive more recognition than ever. This, of course, is not the Comtean doctrine, but only a possible development of it. The notion of humanity as a Great Being is not conducive to the best results in the field of ethics, and it hardly seems possible that Comte would have achieved any measure of suc- cess in his proposed treatise on ethics if he had consistently held to this theological view. Perhaps the failure of positivism to provide any definite ethical theory for the individual ex- plains why there are so few positivists today. Inevitably man will break away from any idea which does not recognize the nobility and eternal significance of the human individual as such. We may conclude, then, that the conception of hu- manity has value as a principle of philosophical co-ordina- tion, but that it does not furnish a sufficient basis for develop- ing a system of morals.
