The piece was loaned by Frans Blom to the collection of the MARI. But there is no further information where and when Blom had obtained it. The sculpture showing a human head in profile is a fragment clearly broken off from a larger carved object. The height of the fragment is 15.8 cm; its width 14.0 cm and the thickness is 5.7 cm. The material is the typical greenish tuffite from which all sculptures at Copan had been carved. On the It" •# . filecard (Accession No. 35-7981) of the MARI collection it had been erroneously designated as "green limestone." The other désignation "Profile head 'tufa' " indeed refers to the material as tuffite. The face shown is that of a young man. Four short Strands of hair are visible atop his ear, a longer one reaches down to his cheek. He probably wore an earflare but this section of the sculpture is broken off. A curly element surrounding his eye and reaching down to his cheek is the most distinctive element on this face. This motif is characteristic for an anthropomorphic young male supernatural being that was designated by Paul Schellhas as God R (Schellhas 1897, Taube 1993), probably an Earth deity aspect. The head of this deity serves also as the head variant for the number eleven, buluk. Prefixed by the bar-and-dot numeral 11, it comprises the name glyph of God R in the códices. The shape and proportions of the face indícate that the fragment perhaps formed part of a hieroglyphic inscription carved almost in high relief. The element in front of the forehead seems to be a lock of hair or a filier element which occurs in various shapes in front of head-variant signs. The elegant and vivid style of the relief is close to that of the monuments commissioned since the reign of Copan's 13"1 ruler Waxaklajuun Ub'aah K'awiil after about 9.14.0.0.0. The piece had been examined by William Fash in 1985 but he could not associate it with a specific structure at Copan. Apart from a building or monument in the Main Group (Gordon 1902; Morley 1920; B. Fash 1992; Baudez 1994), the sculpture could also originate from one of the numerous residential groups in the Copan pocket (Fash and Long 1983). Beside the already comprehensively excavated and restored residential buildings outside of the Main Group which are known to have had mosaic façade sculptures and inscribed monuments (W. Fash 1986, 1989; Ashmore 1988; Sheehy 1991; Andrews and Fash 1992; Webster et al. 1998), numerous buildings in other residential groups throughout the Copan pocket are potential sources of façade sculptures or sculptured inscriptions. On the other hand, the style and size of the carving point to the possible earlier version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway assumed to have been re-used in the later one of Structure 10L-26 (Stuart 2000), which was erected as an ancestral shrine by Copan's 15th ruler K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil in 9.16.4.1.0 (755 AD), as a highly possible source of the sculpture fragment presented here.
