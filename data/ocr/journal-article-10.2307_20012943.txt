<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARC BEKOFF SOCIAL COGNITION: EXCHANGING AND SHARING INFORMATION ON THE RUN ABSTRACT. In this essay I consider various aspects of the rapidly growing field of cognitive ethology, concentrating mainly on evolutionary and comparative discussion of the notion of intentionality. I am not concerned with consciousness, per se, for a concen? tration on consciousness deflects attention from other, and in many cases more interesting, problems in the study of animal cognition. I consider how, when, where, and (attempt to discuss) why individuals from different taxa exchange social information concerning their beliefs, desires, and goals. My main examples come from studies of social play in mam? mals and antipredator behavior in birds. Basically, I argue that although not all individuals always display behavior patterns that are best explained by appeals to intentionality, it is misleading to argue that such explanations have no place in the study of animal cognition. 1. INTRODUCTION Individuals in many animal taxa need to be able to exchange social in? formation. While many details of transmitting, receiving, and processing information can be explained by appealing to hard-wired evolved mech? anisms or to rules of thumb acquired during past exposures to various stimulus-response contingencies, in other instances explanations that ap? peal to the philosophical notion of intentionality (beliefs and desires) more easily and parsimoniously explain observed patterns of behavior. While there has been a good deal of concentration on the cognitive abilities of non-human primates (Byrne and Whiten 1988; Byrne 1995; Russon et al. 1996), there also is a wealth of data on nonprimates that is important for studies of non-human animal (hereafter animal) cognition (Bekoff and Jamieson 1990, 1996; Ristau 1991a; Griffin 1992; Allen and Bekoff 1997; Bekoff and Byers 1998). In this paper, I discuss two different types of behavior, mammalian social play and antipredator behavior in birds, to make the case that the time has come to expand our taxonomic interests in cognitive ethological inquiries. These examples show how individuals exchange information during on-going social encounters - how analyses of social cognition on Erkenntnis 51: 113-128, 1999. ? 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

SOCIAL PLAY BEHAVIOR: HOW INDIVIDUALS NEGOTIATE COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS ON THE RUN In recent years, the scientific study of play behavior has undergone many significant changes. Researchers in various disciplines are conducting de? tailed observational, experimental, and theoretical analyses of play primar? ily in mammals (including humans) and birds. They are concerned with such topics as evolution, ecology, development, social communication, individual well-being, neurobiology, learning, and cognition (for refer? ences see, Bekoff and Byers 1981, 1998; Fagen 1981; Burghardt 1998; Bekoff and Allen 1992, 1998; Allen and Bekoff 1994, 1997; Pelligrini 1995; Sutton-Smith 1998; Burghardt 1999). New data are forcing people to give up old ideas and set ways of thinking about this phenomenon. Most researchers recognize the importance of rigorous interdisciplinary collaboration in play research (Pelligrini 1995; Bekoff and Byers 1998; Burghardt 1998), and the interactions among those studying humans and non-humans are producing exciting new results. Social play behavior is performed by individuals in many mammalian, avian, and perhaps other vertebrate taxa (Fagen 1981; Bekoff and Byers 1998; Burghardt 1998). It is a behavioral phenotype that lends itself to detailed empirical study (Allen and Bekoff 1997; Bekoff and Byers 1998; Burghardt 1999). Following Bekoff and Byers (1981), I will define play as follows: "Play is all motor activity performed postnatally that appears (my emphasis) to be purposeless, in which motor patterns from other contexts may often be used in modified forms and altered temporal sequencing. If the activity is directed toward another living being it is called social play". This definition centers on the structure of play sequences - what animals do when they play - and not on possible functions of play. It concerns what play is, rather than what it is not. The flexibility and versatility of social play make it a good candidate for comparative and evolutionary cognitive studies including those that are concerned with ways in which individuals may negotiate agreements to engage in cooperative (not merely coordin? ated) social interactions. Fagen (1993, p. 192) has noted that "Levels of cooperation in play of juvenile primates may exceed those predicted by simple evolutionary arguments ..." Play cannot occur if the interacting animals do not agree to cooperate. Cognitive ethological approaches are useful for gaining an understand? ing of social play for various of reasons including: (1) it exemplifies many</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL COGNITION 115 of the theoretical issues faced by cognitive ethologists; (2) empirical re? search on social play has and will benefit from a cognitive approach, because play involves communication, intention, role-playing, and cooper? ation; (3) detailed analyses of social play may provide more promising evidence of animal minds than research in many other areas, for it may yield clues about the ability of animals to understand one another's inten? tions; and (4) play occurs in a wide range of mammalian species and in a number of avian species, and thus it affords the opportunity for a com? parative investigation of cognitive abilities extending beyond the narrow focus on primates that often dominates discussions of non-human cogni? tion. For example, during social play, many nonprimates (and primates) engage in self-handicapping and role-reversals, two behavior patterns that are often used to make inferences about intentionality (and consciousness and self-consciousness). Along these lines, Povinelli and Cant (1995, p. 400) suggest that the performance by arboreal ancestors of the great ape/human clade of "unusual locomotor solutions ... drove the evolution of self-conception". Many nonprimate mammals also perform complex, flexible, and unusual acrobatic motor patterns (locomotor-rotational movements; Wilson and Kleiman 1974) during social play, and it would be premature to rule out the possibility that the performance of these behaviors is also important to the evolution of self-conception in nonprimates. In some instances it is difficult to know whether arboreal clambering or the performance of vari? ous acrobatic movements during play may more be related to the evolution of (mere) body awareness (e.g., knowing one's place in space) and not a concept of self. The study of social play also lends itself to Colin Allen's work on con? cepts (this issue, pp. 33-40). Allen explores the idea that an organism O may reasonably be attributed a concept of X (e.g., play) whenever: (1) O systematically discriminates some instances of X from some non-Xs; (2) O is capable of detecting some of its own discrimination errors between Xs and non-Xs; and (3) O is capable of learning to better discriminate Xs from non-Xs as a consequence of its capacity (2). With respect to Allen's point (1), individual canids, especially coyotes, seem to be able to discriminate some cases of play from non-play. They clearly respond differently to long and vigorous bites and long stand-overs (an action that is performed significantly more by dominant individuals during aggressive interactions). Bites directed toward the body and stand overs during play are of significantly shorter duration during play than during aggressive encounters (Hill and Bekoff 1977). Concerning Allen's point (2), individuals seem to have the capacity to recognize that they</page><page sequence="4">116 MARC BEKOFF have misclassified some encounters as play or non-play. For example, when it seems likely that a playful encounter will escalate into aggression, individuals tend to perform a play bow (see below). Allen (personal com? munication) pointed out that this might not be the case if play escalating into aggression is no longer perceived to be play by the interacting animals; there might be no misclassifcation in this case. With respect to point (3), individuals also appear to learn to discriminate play from non-play as a consequence of recognizing their own previous misclassifications. This is especially so in cases where they use play bows or other actions to indicate "this is play" with individuals with whom they had previously made errors. That is, individuals seem more likely to assess more carefully the situation if they have made previous category (play/non-play) errors (Bekoff 1975). 3. THE COMMUNICATION OF THE INTENTION TO PLAY: THE MEANING OF BOWS When individuals play they typically use action patterns that are also used in other contexts, such as predatory behavior, antipredatory beha? vior, and mating. These action patterns may not be intrinsically different across different contexts, or they may be hard to discriminate even for the participants. How do animals know that they are playing? How do they communic? ate their desires or intentions to play? Individuals might know that they are playing because the actions that are performed differ when they are performed during play when compared to other contexts (Hill and Bekoff 1977), or the order in which motor patterns are performed differs from, and might be more variable than, the order in which they are performed during the performance of, for example, serious aggression or serious pr?dation (Bekoff and Byers 1981). While there still are very few empirical data that speak to either of these alternatives (Bekoff and Byers 1981, 1998), numerous people who study play come away with the impression that these possibilities would have strong and wide support if they were studied rigorously. Suffice it to say, playing animals seem to fine-tune on-going play sequences to maintain play and to prevent play from escalating in real aggression. Because there is a chance that various behavior patterns that are per? formed during on-going social play can be misinterpreted, individuals need to tell others "I want to play", "this is still play no matter what I am going to do to you", or "this is still play regardless of what I just did to you". An agreement to play, rather than to fight, mate, or engage in predatory activities, can be negotiated in various ways. Individuals may use various</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL COGNITION 117 behavior patterns - play markers - to initiate play or to maintain the play mood (Bekoff 1995a, 1977; Chalmers 1980; Newberry, Wood-Gush and Hall 1988; Allen and Bekoff 1997) by punctuating play sequences with these actions when it is likely that a particular behavior may have been, or will be, misinterpreted. There is little evidence that play signals are used to deceive others. The "bow", a highly ritualized and stereotyped movement that seems to function to stimulate recipients to engage (or to continue to engage) in social play, provides an excellent example of a signal and it has been extensively studied in various canids in this context. Bows (the animal crouches on her forelimbs and elevates her hindlimbs) occur throughout play sequences, but most commonly at the beginning or towards the middle of playful encounters. In a detailed analysis of the form and duration of play bows (Bekoff 1977) it was shown that duration was more variable than form, and that play bows were always less variable when performed at the beginning, rather than in the middle of, ongoing play sequences. Three possible explanations for this change in variability include: (1) fa? tigue, (2) the fact that animals are performing them from a wide variety of preceding postures, and (3) there is less of a need to communicate that "this is still play" than there is when trying to initiate a new interaction. These explanations are not exclusive alternatives. Play bows occur almost exclusively in the context of play, and it is common to attribute to play-soliciting signals the message "what follows is play" or "this is still play". What is the significance of these messages for the players themselves? Are they in any way aware of the meaning of the play bows, or are they simply conditioned to respond differently, for example, less aggressively or less sexually, when a specific action such as a bite or a mount is preceded by a play bow? One way to approach these questions is to ask whether play signals such as bows are used to maintain social play in situations where the per? formance of a specific behavior during a play bout could be misinterpreted or when an individual makes an error. A recent study of the structure of play sequences (Bekoff 1995a) showed that bows in some canids (infant and adult domestic dogs, infant coyotes, and infant wolves) often are used immediately before and immediately after an action that can be misinter? preted and disrupt ongoing social play. For example, in infant coyotes, wolves, and domestic dogs, the "bow" was not performed randomly, but rather immediately preceded or immediately followed behavior patterns that can be misinterpreted (for example, biting accompanied by vigorous side-to-side shaking of the head). Recall that the social play of canids (and of other mammals) contains actions, primarily bites, that are used in other</page><page sequence="6">118 MARC BEKOFF contexts that do not contain bows (e.g. agonistic, predatory, or antipredat? ory). Actions such as biting accompanied by rapid side-to-side shaking of the head are used in aggressive interactions and also during pr?dation and could be misinterpreted when used in play. While there are few comparat? ive data, in most species in which play has been described, play-soliciting signals appear to foster some degree of cooperation between players so that each responds to the other in a way consistent with play and different from the responses the same actions would elicit in other contexts. 3.1. Sharing Intentions How might a play bow serve to provide information to its recipient about the sender's intentional state - his intentions, desires, and beliefs? Perhaps one's own experiences with play can promote learning about the intentions of others. Perhaps the recipient shares the intentions (beliefs, desires) of the sender based on the recipient's own prior experiences of situations in which she performed bows. It may be reasonable to attribute a very specific second-order inference of the form "when I bow I want to play so when you bow you also want to play" without being committed to a general capacity for the possession of second-order mental states in these animals. Gopnik (1993) has suggested that others' body movements are mapped onto one's own kinesthetic sensations based on prior experience of the observer. She has claimed (p. 275): "In particular, we innately map the body movements of others onto our own kinesthetic sensations. This initial bridge between the inside and the outside, the self and other, underlies our later conviction that all mental states are things both we and others share". Tomasello et al. (1989) also have noted that some gestures in chimpanzees may be learned by "second-person imitation" - "an individual copying a behavior directed to it by another individual" (p. 35). They concluded (p. 45) that chimpanzees "... rely on the sophisticated powers of social cog? nition they employ in determining what is perceived by a conspecific and how that conspecific is likely to react to various types of information ..." Flanagan (1992, p. 102ff) also has been interested in ways in which mental states can be shared, and introduced the notion of a "mental detector" that is used to detect others' invisible mental states. There is research that suggests a neurobiological basis for the under? standing of others' mental states. "Mirror neurons", found in macaques, fire when a monkey executes an action and also when the monkey observes the same action performed by another monkey (G?llese 1998; Gallese and Goldman 1998; see also Jeannerod 1994 for discussion of possible neural bases for kinesthetic-visual matching). These findings are intriguing, and more comparative data are needed to determine if mirror neurons are found</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL COGNITION 119 in other taxa and if they might actually play a role in the sharing of intentions between individuals engaged in an on-going social interaction. 4. SELF-HANDICAPPING AND ROLE-REVERSING IN PLAY Two behavior patterns that have been reported to occur during on-going social play in various mammals are self-handicapping and role-reversing (for reviews see Bekoff and Allen 1998; Biben 1998; Pellis and Pellis 1998; Thompson 1998; Watson 1998). Both might also be important for maintaining a play mood. Self-handicapping occurs when an individual performs behavior pat? terns that might compromise herself. For example, a coyote might not bite her play partner as hard as she can, or she might not play as vigorously as she can. Watson and Croft (1996) found that red-neck wallabies adjusted their play to the age of their partner. When a partner was younger, the older animal adopted a defensive, flat-footed posture, and pawing rather than sparring occurred. In addition, the older player was more tolerant of its partners tactics and took the initiative in prolonging interactions. (While more data are needed, this study also suggests that the benefits of play may vary according to the age of the player.) Role-reversing occurs when a dominant animal performs an action during play that would not normally occur during real aggression. For example, a dominant animal might voluntarily not roll-over on his back during fighting, but would do so while playing. In some instances self-handicapping and role-reversing might occur together. For example, a dominant individual might roll over while play? ing with a subordinate animal or inhibit the intensity of a bite. In other situations, self-handicapping and role-reversing might not be performed together - a subordinate animal restrains herself during play so as not to al? low the interaction to escalate into a real fight. There are very few data that are concerned with self-handicapping and role-reversing in play. In canids, infant coyotes, when compared to infant wolves and beagles, are more aggressive and engage in serious fights that determine social rank (Bekoff 1974). Dominant coyote pups use rolling-over as self-handicapping and role-reversing to get subordinate animals to play. In one case, 38/38 in? stances of rolling-over by a dominant coyote were used in the context of social play. Furthermore, 34/42 (81%) approach/withdrawals were used in social play and resulted in chasing by the subordinate coyote. In real aggressive encounters, dominant animals do not allow others to chase them.</page><page sequence="8">120 MARC BEKOFF Both self-handicapping and role-reversing are also responsible for al? tering the temporal sequencing of play and might serve to call further attention to the intentions of the animal who engages in these activities. That is, not only are the behavioral sequences performed in play different from those performed during serious aggression, but play sequences are punctuated with behavior patterns that indicate that an individual is willing either to handicap himself or to engage in role-reversing. From a functional perspective, self-handicapping and role-reversing, similar to using specific play invitation signals or altering behavioral sequences, might serve to signal an individual's intention to continue to play. The performance of self-handicapping and role-reversing suggests that an individual is able to make an assessment of himself and others and manage or regulate how she plays (Pellis and Pellis 1998, Thompson 1998), and detailed analyses of these activities will undoubtedly inform arguments about the cognitive capacities of animal who engage in them (Allen and Bekoff 1997). Certainly, it appears that individuals trust others to maintain the rules of the game. Biben (1998) stresses the importance of developmental flexibility in the social behavior of rhesus monkeys, and suggests that individuals use play as a way to learn strategies of social interaction that are related to self-competence and self-preservation. To sum up briefly, I found that at least some canids (and, I expect other mammals also would) cooperate when they engage in social play, and that individuals may negotiate these cooperative ventures by sharing their in? tentions. In general, animals engaged in social play use specific signals to modulate the effects of behavior patterns that are typically performed in other contexts, but whose meaning is changed in the context of play. These signals are often flexibly related to the occurrence of events in a play sequence that might violate expectations within that sequence. Further? more, the relationship of play to a cognitive appreciation of the distinction between reality and pretense provides an important link to other cognitive abilities, such as the ability to detect deception (which is extremely rare in social play) or to detect errors. Given these connections, further detailed analyses of various aspects of social play might help promote the devel? opment of more sophisticated theories of intentionality, representation, communication, and (perhaps even) consciousness. 5. ANTIPREDATORY BEHAVIOR IN BIRDS: COGNITION ON THE FLY Antipredator behavior in birds also provides a good example of the use? fulness of comparative cognitive ethological approaches. For example, Ristau (1991b) conducted field studies of injury-feigning in piping plovers</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL COGNITION 121 (the broken-wing display) and wanted to know if she could learn more about deceptive injury-feigning if she viewed the broken-wing display as an intentional or purposeful behavior ("the plover wants to lead the in? truder away from her nest or young") rather than as a hard-wired reflexive response to the presence of a particular stimulus, a potentially intrud? ing predator. She studied the direction in which birds moved during the broken-wing display, how they monitored the location of the predator, and the flexibility of the response. Ristau found that birds usually performed the display in the direction that would lead an intruder who was following them further away from the threatened nest or young, and also that birds monitored the intruder's approach and modified their behavior in responses to variations in the intruder's movements. These and other data led Ristau to conclude that the plover's broken-wing display lent itself to an inten? tional explanation - that plovers purposely lead intruders away from their nests or young and modified their behavior in order to do so. In another field study of antipredator behavior in birds, I (Bekoff 1995b, 1996) found that western evening grosbeaks modified their vigilance or scanning behavior depending on the way in which individuals were po? sitioned with respect to one another. Grosbeaks and other birds often trade-off scanning for potential predators and feeding. Basically (but over? simplified), some birds scan while others feed and some birds feed when others scan. Thus, it can be hypothesized that individuals want to know what others are doing and learn about others' behavior by trying to watch them. My study of grosbeaks showed that when a flock contained four or more birds, there were large changes in scanning and other patterns of behavior that seemed to be related to ways in which grosbeaks attempted to gather information about other flock members. When birds were arranged in a circular array so that they could see one another easily compared to when they were arranged in a line that made visual monitoring of flock members more difficult, birds who had difficulty seeing one another were (1) more vigilant, (2) changed their head and body positions more often, (3) reacted to changes in group size more slowly, (4) showed less coordination in head movements, and (5) showed more variability in all measures. 6. BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY AND INTENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS The differences in behavior between birds organized in circular arrays when compared to birds organized in linear arrays were best explained by accounting for individuals' attempts to learn, via visual monitoring, about what other flock members were doing. This may say something</page><page sequence="10">122 MARC BEKOFF about if and how birds attempt to represent their flock, or at least certain other individuals, to themselves. It may be that individuals form beliefs about what others are most likely doing and predicate their own behavior on these beliefs. I have argued that cognitive explanations were simpler and less cumbersome than non-cognitive rule-of-thumb explanations (e.g., "scan this way if there are this number of birds in this geometric array" or "scan that way if there are that number of birds in that geometric array". Non-cognitive rule-of-thumb explanations did not seem to account for the flexibility in animals' behavior as well or as simply as explanations that appealed to the intentions of the animals under study. In many other instances it also may be more economical or parsimo? nious to assume that not everything that an individual needs to be able to do in all situations in which it finds itself is preprogrammed; intentional explanations can be simpler than cumbersome stimulus-response explan? ations (De Waal 1991; Allen and Bekoff 1997; Bekoff and Allen 1997; Bekoff 1998a). While general rules of thumb may be laid down genetically during evolution, specific rules of conduct that account for all possible contingencies may be too numerous to be hard-wired. Furthermore, while behavioristic learning schemes appealing to notions such as conditioning, generalizing, and substituting can account to a limited extent for behavioral flexibility, behavioral integration, and the use of internal states and images of absent objects in some organisms (e.g., Holland 1990), learning at high degrees of abstraction from sensory stimulation seems less amenable to behavioristic analysis (Bekoff and Allen 1992). Cognitive models of learning provide explanatory schemes for such cases. It might actually be more parsimonious to appeal to intentional explanations in terms of accounting for complex patterns of behavior with fewer explanations. For example, the results of my study on gros? beaks, namely that flock geometry influences various patterns of behavior, are more simply explained in terms of the representational needs or information-gathering goals of grosbeaks than by an attempt to account for the effects of group geometry in terms of numerous and diverse stimulus response contingencies or generalizations from earlier experiences (e.g., the birds are somehow conditioned [or innately predisposed] to produce certain behavioral patterns in response to group geometry). In this case it is difficult to conceive that an individual grosbeak's experience could have included explicit conditioning about the factors that influence when and how it should scan or move its head and body.</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL COGNITION 123 7. towards a broad and comparative cognitive ethology: The relationship between what's happening "out there" and "in here" In his early work, Niko Tinbergen (1951/1989, 1963) identified four over? lapping areas with which ethological investigations should be concerned, namely, evolution (phylogeny), adaptation (function), causation, and de? velopment (ontogeny), and his framework also is useful for those interested in animal cognition (Jamieson and Bekoff 1993; Allen and Bekoff 1997). Burghardt (1997) suggested adding a fifth area, private experience. He (p. 276) noted that "The fifth aim is nothing less than a deliberate attempt to understand the private experience, including the perceptual world and mental states, of other organisms. The term private experience is advanced as a preferred label that is most inclusive of the full range of phenomena that have been identified without prejudging any particular theoretical or methodological approach". Burghardt also noted that calling the fifth area "cognitive ethology" is not radical enough because there may be some historical baggage associ? ated with the use of this term. For one, it is frequently associated with only the study of animal consciousness. However, cognitive ethology is much more than the study of animal consciousness (Allen and Bekoff 1997; Bekoff and Allen 1997; Bekoff 1998a) although many do not mark this distinction. My studies of animal cognition have taught me a number of important lessons. The first is that detailed observational and descriptive research are mandatory, especially under field conditions. We must know what animals do "out there" in order to learn more about what is going on "in here" - in their minds. Of course, experimental work is essential as well, but before we understand the lives of the animals we study, much experimental work is premature and can even be misleading. A second lesson is that the sort of research that is needed in order to study different aspects of animal cognition also is extremely tedious and time-consuming, but there are no substitutes for this work. For example, in a current project on vigilance in western evening grosbeaks, I am finding that individuals exchange inform? ation very rapidly. Information on head (and eye) and body position is lost if frames are not analyzed every l/30th of a second (Bekoff, unpublished data). I hope that my colleagues who study animal cognition as well as (es? pecially?) those who are extremely critical of the study of animal cognition and of the notion of animal minds, will engage in, and in some instances return to, this type of research as we head into the twenty-first century. The third lesson concerns the use of old data. There are many existing data that</page><page sequence="12">124 MARC BEKOFF can inform cognitive ethological inquiries and researchers might consider revisiting them while planning future studies. Sometimes a fresh look at old data can be extremely revealing. All in all, we are a long way from having an adequate data base from which hard-and-fast claims about the taxonomic distribution of various cognitive skills, or about the having of a theory of mind, can be put forth. Byrne (1995), who otherwise takes a strongly primatocentric view of animal cognition, agrees with the importance of conducting broadly com? parative research. Consider studies that show that some monkeys cannot perform imitation tasks that some mice can (Whiten and Ham 1992). If the point is to answer the question if monkeys are smarter than mice or not, it is misleading, for there is no reason to expect a single linear scale of intelligence (Bekoff 1998b,c). In the world of mice it may be more important to be able to do some things than it is in the world of monkeys, but in other respects a monkey may have cognitive capacities that a mouse would lack. There also is much individual variation within species, and this also must be documented more fully. To sum up, speciesist cognitivism must be resisted. We should strive to study individual animals to learn more about their lives in their own worlds (and their abilities to feel pain and to suffer psychologically and physically). Methodological pluralism is required: species-fair methods need to be tailored to the questions and the animals under consideration, and competing hypotheses and explanations need always to be considered. In the absence of suitable criteria and empirical data for making compar? ative claims about smartness or intelligence, we need to be very careful about making such statements as "apes are smarter than monkeys or dogs" for each can do things the other cannot. Thus, Marier (1996, p. 22) con? cluded his review of social cognition in non-human primates and birds as follows: "I am driven to conclude, at least provisionally, that there are more similarities than differences between birds and primates. Each taxon has significant advantages that the other lacks". Along these lines, Tomasello and Call (1997, pp. 399^4-00) summarized their comprehensive review of primate cognition by noting that "The experimental foundation for claims that apes are 'more intelligent' than monkeys is not a solid one, and there are few if any naturalistic observations that would substantiate such broad-based, species-general claims". There are many examples other than social play and antipredator beha? vior that could have been chosen for illustration, but these two behavior patterns make the case that chauvinism on either side of the debate con? cerning how to explain animal behavior is unwarranted. Sometimes some non-humans (and some humans) behave as stimulus-response machines</page><page sequence="13">SOCIAL COGNITION 125 and at other times some non-humans (and some humans) behave in ways that are best explained using a rich cognitive vocabulary. A pluralistic approach will result in the best understanding of the minds of other animals.
