As a visual model for the “classical” postcolonial discourse theories that have given rise to such often-cited notions as cultural hybridity, mim- icry, and “writing back,”1 the notion of the frame, I argue, offers a pow- erful conceptual tool for negotiating the operational difWculties of such models of postcolonial criticism, for which neither their originat-  ors nor their more recent critics are able fully to account. In particular, I will suggest that what Paul Duro identiWes as the frame’s “tendency to invisibility” in critical discourse (1) provides us with an apparatus for locating the ever-shifting sites of agency in the complex critical operations of poststructuralism-inXected postcolonial criticism, which I shall argue has a tendency to efface its own presence even as it per- forms its work. I hope that from my discussion will emerge an impression of a body of theory that—despite signiWcant real and apparent differences between individual approaches and practitioners—is paradigmati- cally ekphrastic in nature, governed always by a temporalizing, narra- tivizing impulse in its radical unsettling of the “works” of Wction, colonialist history, and modernity. Given the size and scope of this essay, it will necessarily be theoretical for the most part, rehearsing its central arguments by aligning observations concerning the semiotics of the frame with current postcolonial critical positions. In the last section of the essay, however, I will sketch out my theoretical formu- lations in a more practical manner, by providing and then analyzing Cultural Critique 77—Winter 2011—Copyright 2011 Regents of the University of Minnesota </page> <page sequence="2"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 103 FRAMING THEORY 103 my own reading of an ekphrastic Wction that operates within post- colonial and counter-discursive paradigms—an example, therefore, that will seek to be at once critical and metacritical. THE MONA LISA SMILE SYNDROME: THEORY AT THE LIMITS OF REPRESENTATION My opening suggestion that the frame constitutes a “simple image” is immediately complicated through a consideration of the frame’s tendency to invisibility. Attempting to conjure a mental picture of the frame necessitates also conjuring what might lie inside and outside it. Whether the frame is mounted on a gallery wall or demarcates the limits of a movie screen, the image that we have brought to mind almost certainly contains a work, some form of representation,which it presents for our attention. The frame, then, though it is not the work, is indis- sociable from it; presents it in a certain manner, in a certain light; and draws attention to the relationship between the work and its setting. The frame serves as the principal example of what Jacques Derrida terms a parergon: “neither work (ergon) nor outside the work [hors d’oeuvre], neither inside nor outside, neither above nor below, it dis- concerts any opposition but does not remain indeterminate and it gives rise to the work” (1987, 9). A parergon, for Derrida, fulWlls the role of “a supplement outside the work, [which] must, if it is to have the sta- tus of a philosophical quasi-concept, designate a formal and general predicative structure, which one can transport intact or deformed and re formed according to certain rules, into other Welds, to submit new contents to it” (55). From these descriptions, it may readily be seen that literary theory in general occupies a space with respect to the lit- erary work closely analogous to that of the frame with respect to the visual art object: it lies outside the work, but supplements it (I will return to Derrida’s use of this term and its particular relevance to my model later); it produces cognitive structures that can be taken to the work in order to enhance reading in the light of new contents. More simply, the primary function of theory—perhaps even its only func- tion—is to give rise to (certain readings or aspects of) the work. This much can be said of literary theory in general as frame, man- ifested in its dualistic positioning between interior and exterior, which </page> <page sequence="3"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 104 104 RICHARD BROCK lends it the mediating role that gives rise to both. Yet my suggestion of the frame as a model for postcolonial discourse theory in particular rests on a duality, unique to the object of the frame, which situates it always at the boundary between spatiality and temporality. Consider, for example, the movie “frame” versus the framed visual artwork. The “frame” of a movie, in addition to referring to all that is organized in the space on the screen, can also refer to a frozen instant, a single ex - posure on a Wlm reel, which combines with thousands of others to create a narrative. Each frame of a movie at once represents a com- plete organization of visual elements and a tiny fragment of a Wxed temporal sequence: it is an entirely spatially constituted entity, de-  signed to function in a temporal realm. The visual art object, while it shares the two-dimensional spatial arrangement of visual elements, in fact fulWlls the reverse function with respect to spatiality and tem- porality. This time a plurality of possible narratives is coded into the spatial elements of the single frame. Indeed, it could be argued that the warmth of a work’s public reception increases with the number of narrative possibilities which remain (partially) visible within the visual Weld: there is no better example of this than the continuing preoccu- pation with “the” narrative behind the enigmatic smile of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, which seems to have left no corner of high or popular art untouched.2 The Mona Lisa is the paradigmatic example of an art form that is constituted temporally but operates in an exclu- sively spatial realm. What we might playfully term something like the “Mona Lisa Smile Syndrome” demonstrates an awareness, at the level of popular culture and the everyday, of what both of the above examples illus- trate: the frame’s situation in a moment between spatiality and tem- porality, where the temporal Xows of entities in a spatial plane are arrested. Insofar as it is always attendant on such a reduction, the frame represents an organizational principle, an icon of Wxity that seems diametrically opposed to the Xuid, hybrid gestures character- istic of postcolonial critical engagements; yet if it is not precisely out- side the spatiotemporal collapse represented by the work itself, the frame nevertheless also occupies the marginal locus where mediation between the spatial and the temporal takes place. With such dualities inherent in its very being and function, the frame shares much in com- mon with the disjunctive “interstitial” space in which Homi Bhabha </page> <page sequence="4"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 105 FRAMING THEORY 105 suggests the spatial Eurocentric “mapping” of modernity and history is disrupted by the emerging temporalities of postcolonial discourse. Insisting that a “mapping” that concerns itself merely with “spatial position” and “representational visibility” is inadequate, Bhabha suggests that what must be mapped as a new international space of discontinuous historical realities is, in fact, the problem of signifying the interstitial passages and processes of cultural difference that are inscribed in the “in-between,” in the temporal break-up that weaves the “global” text. It is, ironically, the disintegrative moment, even movement, of enuncia- tion—the sudden disjunction of the present—that makes possible the rendering of culture’s global reach. And, paradoxically, it is only through a structure of splitting and displacement—“the fragmented and schizo- phrenic decentring of the self”—that the architecture of the new histor- ical subject emerges at the limits of representation itself. (310) This passage succinctly expresses many of Bhabha’s core ideas con- cerning the emergence of the postcolonial subject in the marginal spaces “at the limits of representation,” the precise location at which the frame is to be found. Bhabha’s repeated references to disjunctures, splits and breaks that—paradoxically—enable a “reach” beyond the plane of representation, of the “global text,” likewise correspond closely to what I have characterized as the duality of the frame’s func- tion as limit, at once demarcating a disjunctive boundary to the work and mediating between its interior and exterior. Finally, the reference here to a temporal/spatial duality inherent in the splitting of the sub- ject of modernity (embodied in the tension between disintegrative moment and movement) also recalls the parallel duality in the frame, once again identifying the marginal spaces at the edge of representa- tion as the site of translation between spatiality and temporality. My development of the frame as a model for the marginal artic - ulations of postcolonial discourse theory owes much to Bhabha’s  spatiotemporal formulations, almost all of which are situated in mar- ginal, “in-between” spaces reminiscent of the frame. A chapter in The Location of Culture entitled “The Commitment to Theory” speaks in afWrmative terms of the political value of literary theory, precisely be - cause “it overcomes the given grounds of opposition and opens up a space of translation: a space of hybridity, Wguratively speaking, where the construction of a political object that is new, neither the one nor the </page> <page sequence="5"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 106 106 RICHARD BROCK other [compare Derrida’s reading of the frame as that which is “nei- ther inside nor outside” and “disconcerts any opposition”], properly alienates our political expectations, and changes, as it must, the very forms of our recognition of the moment of politics” (37). Spaces (or temporalities) of hybridity emerge again and again in The Location of Culture as Bhabha formulates and reformulates locations of splitting and doubling that give rise to articulations of cultural difference, con- verging ever more insistently on the proWle of the frame that I offer here. The “time-lag of the colonial relation” reveals that “modernity and postmodernity are themselves constituted from the marginal per- spective of cultural difference” (281); the “non-synchronous tempo- rality of global and national cultures opens up a cultural space—a third space—where the negotiation of incommensurable differences creates a tension peculiar to borderline existences” (312). Closing in on the site of this “third space,” Bhabha notes both that “the contour of difference is agonistic, shifting, splitting, rather like Freud’s descrip- tion of the system of consciousness which occupies a position in space lying on the border-line between inside and outside” (156; italics added), and that “the contingent and the liminal become the times and the spaces for the historical representation of the subjects of cultural dif- ference in a postcolonial criticism” (256). Most crucially of all, in the closing pages of his conclusion, Bhabha identiWes the “translation of the meaning of time into the discourse of space; [the] catachrestic sei-  zure of the signifying ‘caesura’ of modernity’s presence and present,” as the moment at which “the cultural location of modernity shifts to the postcolonial site” (360). The question of cultural “location,” the foremost preoccupation of Bhabha’s work, Wnally settles itself (provisionally) on a site marked by both spatiotemporal translation and disjuncture: the “caesura” rep- resents a break in the poetic line both spatially (visible in the arrange- ment of words on the page) and temporally (manifested in a pause in the line as read). In this respect, Bhabha’s “caesura,” like Derrida’s parergon,might be viewed as an exemplary instance of what the latter terms spacing,which, in the context of the notion of différance, reXects the undetectable intervals that arise in the deferral of presence, speak- ing “the articulation of space and time, the becoming-space of time and the becoming-time of space,” and remaining “the unperceived, the nonpresent, and the nonconscious” (1976, 68). Such a reading of </page> <page sequence="6"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 107 FRAMING THEORY 107 spacing, however, is limited in this context in that it threatens to allow the spatial and temporal coordinates of the critical articulation to dis- appear into each other, obscuring the place of criticism just as we have made it visible. Thus, while Derrida’s earliest theoretical uses of spac- ing, focusing solely on the articulation of space and time in language, appear to disclose the mutual dependency of the two concepts to the point where any essential difference between them becomes impossi- ble to articulate, my own use of the frame as a metaphor for literary theory in general and postcolonial theory in particular is indebted more to his later, more Xexible uses of the concept in work on non- verbal artforms, which tend to adopt a more or less “commonsense” distinction between spatiality and temporality.3 In an interview with Peter Brunette and David Wills concerning the applicability of decon- struction to the “spatial arts” (which is to say, painting, sculpture, and cinema), Derrida situates the special properties of these artforms precisely in their resistance to temporalization, arguing that “it is within a certain experience of spacing, of space, that resistance to philo- sophical authority can be produced. In other words, resistance to logocentrism has a better chance of appearing in these types of art” (1994, 10). For Derrida, this “resistance” to the temporality of discourse can be both a positive and negative property: on the one hand, the spatial arts are able to counter the “discursive hegemony” of philosophy as a discipline, disclosing “a real place from the perspective of which, and in which, words Wnd their limit” (1994, 13); on the other hand, however, this same resistance means that the spatial artwork “be - comes the very place of a word that is all the more powerful because it is silent, and that carries within it . . . a discursive virtuality that is in Wnitely authoritarian, in a sense theologically authoritarian. Thus it can be said that the greatest logocentric power resides in a work’s silence, and liberation from this authority resides on the side of dis- course, a discourse that is going to relativize things, emancipate itself, refuse to kneel in front of the authority represented by sculpture, or architecture” (13). It is this conception of the silent, spatial artwork (which, in its inhospitability to the temporal, becomes a kind of re-  pository or tomb for discourse, exercising a tyrannical authority as  it does so) that is of special value to the notion of the frame as a  structural metaphor for postcolonial discourse theory. The “inWnitely </page> <page sequence="7"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 108 108 RICHARD BROCK authoritarian” spatial artwork here metonymically represents a vari- ety of literal and Wgurative uses of space to conceal the temporal maneuvers of colonial discourse. Hence, the Enlightenment’s ratio- nalizing of spatial representation through linear perspective—a sys- tem whose abstraction of the viewing subject to an omniscient point behind the plane of representation not-so-coincidentally arose in tan- dem with early colonial explorers’ depiction of newly discovered land as empty space, entirely unshaped by the narratives and experiences of its existing inhabitants4—appears on a continuum with the con- temporary historiographies that Bhabha characterizes as “insistent spatializ[ations] of the time of modernity” (349), whose constructions of modernity and history as synchronic, spatial entities contribute to their Eurocentric Wxity, and “[fall] prey to the notion of the ‘cultural’ as a social formation whose discursive doubleness—the transcenden- tal and empirical dialectic—is contained in a temporal frame that makes difference repetitively ‘contemporaneous,’ regimes of sense- as-synchronous” (349). Whether it is achieved through the realist work of visual art’s insistence on the absolute, universal authority of European construc- tions of rationality over space, or through the more Wgurative spa- tializations entailed in the reiWcation of Eurocentric historiography and the ossiWcation of modernity as an inWnitely repetitious synchro-  nicity, the work of colonial self-fashioning aspires always to what Wendy Steiner, in a different context, calls the “atemporal eternity” of the nondiscursive object (1988, 14), imbuing its epistemologies with the permanence and unimpeachable authority-in-presence of the inanimate. Insofar as it entails a burial (both in the senses of suppres- sion and entombment) of discourse, this work is fundamentally anti - discursive, properly belonging to the domain of what Derrida terms the “spatial arts.” As such, the emancipatory function of discourse- based postcolonial criticism requires it to mediate between the “inW- nitely authoritarian” “discursive virtuality” of the spatial work and the temporal domain of discursive actuality, the domain in which “liber- ation from this authority” is to be found. In part, then, the metaphor- ical device of the frame is the natural ally of a project that “displays the problem of the ambivalent temporality of modernity that is often over- looked in the more ‘spatial’ traditions of some aspects of postmodern theory” (Bhabha, 342; emphasis in original). The frame, that is to say, </page> <page sequence="8"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 109 FRAMING THEORY 109 represents the locus in which the ideologicalmaneuvers underscoring both the “becoming-space of time” and the “becoming-time of space” might become visible, if only Xeetingly. The ideological dimension of his critique of the spatiotemporal properties of modernity helps to explain why Bhabha himself never settles on the metaphorical device of the frame, despite a vocabulary of margins, borderlines, and breaks that permeates his critical work. Bhabha’s commitment to privileging temporality over spatiality leads to a natural suspicion of any metaphor that appears to be exclusively spatial in nature (an objection, which, as we have seen, need not pre- clude the use of the frame as a device along both spatial and tempo- ral axes). Bhabha persuasively argues that a spatial construction of history is inadequate to decenter it from its reiWed position at the heart of Western discourses of modernity, a decentering that his own radical, temporality-based critique is far better placed to effect. Yet this privileging of temporality, I believe, leads Bhabha to pay insufW- cient attention to the spatial dimensions in which his own theoretical modulations operate. To adapt Bhabha’s own phrase, his work is characterized by an “insistent temporalizing of the spaces of theory.” In practice, what this means is that Bhabha offers only Xeeting glimpses of the “in-between” and “interstitial” spaces he proposes for the operation of theory, eschew - ing the kind of locatability that would ensure their permanent visi- bility and transparency. Within Bhabha’s own paradigm of Xuidity and the absolute disavowal of reiWcation, the avoidance of a temporal Wxity that might result in the reiWcation of the “objects” of theory and discourse is understandable. The model of the frame, however, offers at once a spatial Wxity and a temporal Xuidity that render the elusive spaces of theoretical operation visible and transparent, even if only in the shape of a metacommentary on their tendency to invisibility. (RE)COMMITTING TO “THEORY” A renewed attention to the spaces in which postcolonial discourse the- ory operates is, I want to suggest here, a matter of the utmost urgency. Before I proceed to discuss the applications of a framing metaphor further, it is therefore necessary to outline the rationale for focusing </page> <page sequence="9"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 110 110 RICHARD BROCK on this model of postcoloniality in particular and the reasons why the “reframing” I propose should be considered a pressing and relevant matter. In the discussion that follows, I will focus on two critics in particular as representatives of discourse-based postcolonial theory: I will continue to discuss Bhabha, whose brilliant though spatially elusive essays on colonial and postcolonial ambivalence, hybridity, and mimicry at once provide ample instances of the problematics I attempt to address, and contribute substantially to the vocabulary I employ  in elucidating them. By way of both continuity and contrast, I shall also offer a detailed discussion of Helen TifWn’s inXuential 1987 essay “Post-Colonial Literatures and Counter-Discourse,” which pioneered many of the ideas expanded upon in the book The Empire Writes Back (co-authored with Bill Ashcroft and Gareth GrifWths) that followed it in 1989. Two theorists whose work Wrst came to prominence during the initial rise of postcolonial studies in the 1980s (following the land- mark application of Foucault’s poststructuralist discourse analysis to a colonial context in Edward Said’s 1978 work Orientalism), Bhabha’s and TifWn’s coinages remain among the most frequently cited para- digms in contemporary literary studies, where their frameworks of subtle cultural appropriation have given rise to hundreds if not thou- sands of postcolonial readings of individual literary works.5 My choice of these two critics in particular is to a certain extent an arbitrary selection (as, indeed, is my choice of Marxist exemplars elsewhere), based on aspects of their work that are hospitable to de-  constructive analysis and that I believe can be argued to be represen- tative of certain trends of discourse-based postcolonial criticism. It does not, however, claim to be anything approaching an exhaustive Weld study. To this extent, my selection of Bhabha and TifWn rests in part upon their considerable similarities, but it is based equally on some telling differences. These two critics may be viewed as occupy- ing opposite ends of a spectrum of critical work that, in its totality, reXects postcolonial theory’s inheritance from poststructuralist notions of discourse and representation, and of sociocultural positions de-  Wned in relational rather than absolute terms. If Bhabha’s often difW- cult work occupies the high-theoretical ground, TifWn by contrast is Wrst and foremost a practical critic, focused more on particular, demon- strable instances of cultural production (which may go some way toward explaining why she has so far largely escaped the charges of </page> <page sequence="10"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 111 FRAMING THEORY 111 indulgence in apolitical textuality that recent critical works have lav- ished not only on Bhabha but also on Said, who arguably writes from a more overtly “political” position than either Bhabha or TifWn). They are, however, united by their profound suspicion of simple binary oppositions in resistance to imperial discourses, which, they argue, lock the colonized into the terms of reference dictated by the colonizer and as such are inadequate responses to the totalizing nature of colo- nial representation. More telling, as we shall see, despite substan- tial differences in vocabulary, style, and approach, the framing opera- tions their critical works perform at the mediating boundary between  spatiality and temporality can be demonstrated to be fundamentally identical, not only generating equally productive and subversive read- ings but also raising equally problematic questions about agency and authorship. Perhaps somewhat counter-intuitively, I would suggest that this essay’s focus on these critics is of vital importance precisely because, some two decades on from the initial formulation of their most inXu - ential ideas, the inXuence of these constructs appears Wnally to be  on the wane, in the face of repeated assertions from Marxian post - colonialists and globalization theorists that the time of Theory with a capital “T” (which is to say, of poststructuralist/deconstructionist in-  heritance) has passed. By considering the vigorous interrogations of poststructuralism-based postcolonial theory that have emerged from these quarters, I intend not to add my voice to the growing chorus proclaiming “Theory’s” obsolescence, but rather to afWrm my own commitment to “Theory,” which I believe remains best placed to effect the kind of self-reXexive criticism required of postcolonial reading. In doing so, I make two claims: Wrst, that postcolonial discourse theories have already refuted many of their detractors’ claims substantially and effectively, and that those legitimate questions that remain can be re-  solved with reference to the metaphorical device of the frame, a con- ceptual tool entirely in keeping with the theories it seeks to examine; second, that, even within readings undertaken by self-identiWed mate- rialist critics, the framing action of a discourse-based theoretical  paradigm remains an indispensible, if disavowed, component of any reading seeking to mediate between the interiority of the work and the cultural and/or material conditions that give rise to it. The tension between the “cultural” and the “material” is central to </page> <page sequence="11"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 112 112 RICHARD BROCK the critiques of poststructuralist methodologies brought to bear by Marxist critics. Aijaz Ahmad, in his 1994 book In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures, complains of the institutionalization of postcolonial stud- ies in the Anglo-American academy, arguing that “debates about cul- ture and literature on the Left no longer presume a labour movement as the ground from which they arise; ‘theory’ is now seen . . . as a ‘conversation’ among academic professionals” (2). For Ahmad, post- colonial discourse theory “inevitably believe[s] that ideas—‘culture’ [is] the collective term in most mystiWcations, but it mainly mean[s] books and Wlms—and not the material conditions of life which in-  clude the instance of culture itself, determine the fate of peoples and nations” (41). These are grave charges, and for many have been sufW- ciently convincing to bring about something of a “material turn” away from poststructuralist, discourse-based approaches at the van- guard of postcolonial thought. Thus, ten years after the emergence of Ahmad’s In Theory, Benita Parry was able to assert with some conW- dence, in the introduction to Postcolonial Studies: A Materialist Critique, that “the volume and vigour of work advancing Marxist/Marxisant positions within postcolonial studies has abated the predominance of a textual idealism,” while cautioning that “it remains important to urge more historically grounded directions and greater discrimina- tion in the enquiries of an ecumenical and proliferating Weld where the material impulses to colonialism, its appropriation of physical resources, exploitation of human labour and institutional repression, have receded from view” (3). It would, of course, be irresponsible to suggest that these are any- thing other than important—even vital—concerns; yet such accounts too often dismiss the many legitimate objections regarding the total- izing tendencies of Marxist critique that caused Wrst the poststructur-  alists, and then the postcolonialists they inXuenced, to treat it with deep suspicion. The relevance of these objections within a postcolonial context is articulated effectively in Robert Young’s White Mythologies, in which Young dwells on the Marxist reliance on a linear, teleologi- cal construction of history, reminding us that “Marxism’s universal- izing narrative of the unfolding of a rational system of world history is simply a negative form of the history of European imperialism” (33). In addition to outlining the complicity of Eurocentric historiogra- phies with imperialism, Young has devoted a considerable portion of </page> <page sequence="12"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 113 FRAMING THEORY 113 his work to complicating what he sees as a false opposition between “apolitical” poststructuralism and the more avowedly and transpar- ently political approaches attached to Marxism, through a unique focus on poststructuralism as an “event” historically and spatially grounded in Third World radicalism. In the introduction to White Mythologies he argues that “if so-called ‘so-called poststructuralism’ is the product of a single historical moment, then that moment is probably not [the Paris student riots of] May 1968 but rather the Algerian War of inde- pendence” (32), citing the personal connections, by birth or other- wise, of many prominent poststructuralists and deconstructionists to Algeria and its struggles for self-determination. In a more recent book, Postcolonialism: A Historical Introduction, Young furthers his argument for poststructuralism as a “Third-World” criticism by devoting two chapters—“Foucault in Tunisia” and “Derrida in Algeria”—to studies of the political, cultural, and spatial situatedness of poststructura list thought. If he occasionally overstates the case—as when he attributes Foucault’s often-criticized Eurocentrism to an unwillingness to en-  gage in colonialist ethnology (2001, 397)—Young’s arguments debunk Ahmad’s rather simplistic view of poststructuralism as an irrevoca- bly tainted and solipsistic product of the Western academy, incongru - ously applied to situations that call for activism rather than wordplay. It is worth noting that the tension between activism and theory has been explored extensively by the very critics Ahmad attacks, most notably Edward Said, who as early as 1983 had commented in The World, the Text, and the Critic that “critics have been content to conWne themselves to the academic matter of literature, to the exist- ing institutions for teaching and employing students of literature,  to the often ridiculous and always self-Xattering notion that their de - bates have a supremely important bearing upon crucial interests affect- ing humankind” (160). A more attentive reading of Said might have prompted Ahmad to consider, in Said’s terms, the “worldliness” of his own book, and its inevitable circumscription within academic cir- cles—one more addition to “a conversation among academic profes- sionals.” Said’s work is characterized by an acute awareness that, by its very nature, and deWned inevitably by the (institutional) contexts in which it is produced, theoretical and critical work belongs Wnally to the realm of “culture,” and not activism. Yet, to the extent that the varied, interdisciplinary applications of the “cultural” engage ments </page> <page sequence="13"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 114 114 RICHARD BROCK of postcolonial discourse theories have lent them currency in a wide range of Welds, they might be viewed as rather less circumscribed by the conWnes of “academic conversation” than the ostensibly more polit- ically engaged approaches advocated by Ahmad. This consideration brings us to the danger postcolonial studies faces if the “mater ial turn” is allowed entirely to displace discourse-based postcolonial models. For if, as Ahmad and his fellow Marxist dissenters have persuasively argued, the material has been imperfectly appropriated by the “cul- tural” in postcolonial discourse theories, there so far appears to be far less space for the cultural in many of the materialist accounts that have emerged to challenge them. I would contend that the best critical and theoretical work to emerge in postcolonial studies since the dawn of the new millennium by and large continues in the self-reXexive traditions of postcolonial discourse theory while incorporating many of the cautionary notes sounded by Marxist critiques of this body of theory, at once generat- ing “cultural” theoretical principles with broad critical applications and turning its deconstructive gaze back on the discipline that has coalesced around the founding works of the 1970s and ’80s. Graham Huggan’s The Postcolonial Exotic: Marketing the Margins, arguably the best and most inXuential of these more recent critical works, is exem- plary in this regard. Examining in detail the discursive processes of exoticism and the fetishizing of difference, Huggan’s book goes on to discuss the material and “cultural” effects of such discourses (the commoditization of ethnicity, the booming industry in “exotic” cul- tural artifacts, and the consequent circumscription of modes of cul- tural expression among “postcolonial” communities to articulations of salable “multicultural” perspectives), all the while considering the ways in which the academic discipline of postcolonial studies is com- plicit in the exoticization of the capitalist West’s “others.” Such works are, however, becoming fewer and farther between: suspicious of extrapolating abstractions gleaned from cultural readings into the “concrete” realm of political and economic analysis, recent materialist works have not had anything like the same effect on the vocabularies of postcolonial cultural critics as those of the postcolonial discourse theorists. If this trend continues, and theoretical work continues to move away from discourse-based analytical paradigms, critics ap-  proaching new works from a postcolonial perspective are liable to be </page> <page sequence="14"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 115 FRAMING THEORY 115 increasingly faced with a stark choice: to continue working within unmodiWed and increasingly outdated versions of frameworks estab- lished a quarter of a century ago, or to embrace a newer breed of post- colonial analysis that, for all its claims to the contrary, conspicuously fails to theorize the relationship between the work and its material contexts. MATERIAL TURN, THEORETICAL SPLIT The danger here, I want to suggest, is of a destructive divorce between postcolonial theory and criticism,which Wnds theorists at the vanguard of postcolonial thought embroiled in ever more “concrete” political discussions, while applied postcolonial criticism becomes slowly dis- engaged from contemporary politics altogether. And there is no better place to analyze the practical effects of this split than Parry’s Postcolo- nial Studies: A Materialist Critique, one of the most enthusiastic endorse- ments of the critical trends that have been instrumental in bringing  it about. A close reading of Parry’s book reveals an irreconcilable schism between Parry the Marxist theorist and Parry the cultural critic, despite an impressive mission statement that announces its intention of uniting the “material” and the “cultural” more closely than ever: “What [I am] concerned to suggest is that without moving in a direc- tion where studies of actually existing political, economic and cultural conditions, past and present, are no longer separated from meta- critical speculations, or culture and discourse from histories that have happened or are still in the making, postcolonial studies will remain ensnared in an increasingly repetitive preoccupation with sign sys- tems and the exegetics of representation” (12). By Parry’s own ac - count, her materialist analyses will serve to diminish such separations, providing a basis for theoretical mediation between the “cultural” and the “material.” Yet, for all the conWdence with which Parry asserts her intentions, her work has precisely the opposite effect in practice. Postcolonial Studies: A Materialist Critique is split more or less equally between theoretical sections that focus in the main on (debunking) par- adigms developed by other theorists (and which therefore belong, quite literally, to the realm of “meta-critical speculation”), and closely </page> <page sequence="15"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 116 116 RICHARD BROCK argued critical readings that, if they are concerned to emphasize the importance of the “material” as a context, fail to turn their “cultural” insights back onto this material context to yield any larger-scale the- oretical insights—except on those occasions when Parry lapses into the very kind of discourse-centered analysis she rejects so em phatically elsewhere. The problems in Parry’s work begin with her rejection of “that theoretical mode which rather than conceiving language as signifying reality allots ontological priority to the semiotic process, [meaning that] the generation of meaning is located in the enunciative act, and not in the substance of the narrated event” (59), a position that she unjustiWably ascribes to Bhabha alone, when it might reasonably be argued to be a central tenet of the Foucauldian model on which all postcolonial discourse theories, to a lesser or greater extent, are based. Indeed, if there is a single mantra that unites this heterogeneous body of theory and sets in opposition to the approaches advocated by Parry, it might well be Foucault’s assertion that “what makes power hold good, what makes it accepted, is simply the fact that it doesn’t only weigh on us as a force that says no, but that it traverses and produces things, it induces pleasure, forms knowledge, produces discourse” (1980, 119). If Parry is right to suggest that the absolute priority of sig- nifying practices—with its attendant tendency to theorize the colo- nial experience as an exclusively discursive rather than a material one—is to some extent a conceptual Wction, it is at least a richly pro- ductive one. “Cultural” criticism yields theoretical principles beyond the work under immediate discussion precisely because it is able to identify constitutive discursive processes in the act of forming the social conWgurations of knowledge and perception upon which schemes of power and domination (and resistance) are built. When, on the other hand, a literary or “cultural” work is viewed simply as a reXection of a particular set of social circumstances, rather than as a constituent and active component of this milieu’s coming-into-being, such an ap-  proach is methodologically incapable of conceiving of that work as stand- ing for more than itself, and of thereby yielding insights into broader “cultural” phenomena. Inevitably, therefore, despite the promise of Parry’s opening, the applied critical readings that accompany her metatheoretical explo- rations are radically limited in scope. Symptomatic of this limitation </page> <page sequence="16"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 117 FRAMING THEORY 117 is her chapter on Rudyard Kipling, a Wgure whose works, as several other critics have argued persuasively, was instrumental in shaping Britain’s imperial consciousness at home,6 but who, in Parry’s read- ing, becomes merely a chronicler of a historical moment. This approach so severely limits the capacity of Parry’s reading to generate broader cultural implications that, at times, the most substantive conclusions she is able to draw from some impressively detailed close readings concern the Wgure of the author himself. Thus, we learn that Kipling “set out to be the bard of empire” (an ambition that “was abundantly realized, [although] this is not all that he became”) (121); that critical “rehabilitations” of Kipling as a discerning student of India are ulti- mately unsustainable, given his journalistic practice of “vilifying the customs and manners of contemporary India and ridiculing its ancient literary heritages” (124); and that “Kipling is an exemplary artist of imperialism” (130). At times, then, Parry’s reading of Kipling appears to be in danger of slipping altogether from the realm of theory into the domain of lit- erary (dis-)appreciation. However, it does occasionally seem to gesture toward broader cultural implications, when it focuses on the internal tensions in his rhetoric, allowing Parry to argue that “what criticism can recover, through dismantling the plural discourses and reconstruct- ing the displacements and erasures, is the effaced historical context and unrehearsed enunciations of the anxieties in the conquering imag- ination, both necessarily repressed by the exigencies of ideological representation” (121; italics added). If, in Parry’s own reXections on the implications and applications of her own reading, she has restricted herself exclusively to the domain of discourse and representation, ap-  pearing temporarily to have forgotten the “material” consequences of “the conquering imagination,” we do not have to look too far for an account of the broader signiWcance of the undisclosed “anxieties” she Wnds within colonial discourses: “In order to understand the pro- ductivity of colonial power it is crucial to construct its regime of truth, not to subject its representations to a normalizing judgement. Only then does it become possible to understand the productive ambiv-  alence of the object of colonial discourse—that ‘otherness’ which is at once an object of desire and derision, an articulation of difference contained within the fantasy of origin and identity. What such a read- ing reveals are the boundaries of colonial discourse and it enables a </page> <page sequence="17"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 118 118 RICHARD BROCK transgression of these limits from the space of that otherness” (Bhabha,  96). It is ironic, though ultimately unsurprising, that we are required to turn to Bhabha—the focus of so much of Parry’s ire against post- colonial discourse theories—to appreciate the signiWcance of the am- biv alent, double articulations of colonial fear and desire that Parry  Wnds in Kipling. For a critical reading such as Parry’s, which fails— or refuses—to acknowledge the productive, mutually constituting rela- tionship between discourse and power, is methodologically bound to be constrained within the work it analyzes, however subtle or brilliant that analysis may be. Parry’s materialist reading of the postcolonial, then, remains irre - vocably split, between the tightly constrained interiority of the work and the remote exteriority of “meta-critical speculation.” To even hint at the possibility of mediation between the two, Parry’s only possible recourse is to frame her reading with a discourse-based paradigm capable of performing such mediation—in this case, with Bhabha’s paradigm of productive ambivalence in the discourses of colonialism, a theoretical debt that she pointedly refuses to recognize, despite bor- rowing extensively from its vocabulary. Parry’s own critical approach thus shows us that, paradoxically, the impetus toward a more “con- crete” political engagement may be the very thing that breaks up alto- gether the always imperfect marriage between “culture” and politics that has informed postcolonial discourse theories, greatly reducing the value of theory and criticism in the process, until both really are rendered mere conversations between academics. This prognosis is an especially bleak prospect for scholars whose primary focus within the paradigms of postcolonial theory is on  situations where colonial discourses are both ongoing and deeply disjunctive—in a nation such as Canada (the main focus of my own postcolonial inquiries), for example, where the inclusive discourses  of multiculturalism both perpetuate and seek to atone for the other- ing processes central to colonial conquest and rule; where overt resis- tance to the dominant Anglo culture from both First Nations and Queb ecois communities is assimilated into a pluralist national nar- rative; where national identity can sometimes seem to reside rather prec ariously between the history of multiple colonizations that consti- tuted the nation as a sovereign territory and the ever-present perceived  </page> <page sequence="18"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 119 FRAMING THEORY 119 threat posed to that sovereignty by American neo-imperialism. As  Leonard Cohen’s radical Quebecois nationalist F. succinctly puts it in Beautiful Losers, “The English did to us what we did to the Indians, and the Americans did to the English what the English did to us” (199). While a continuous present tense seems more appropriate for the relations of domination and subjugation F. describes, there are times when reading the complex interactions of cultural signiWca- tion in Canada feels (rather like reading Cohen’s novel) to be a vain attempt to construct a single whole from an evasive postmodern pas- tiche of colonization, domination, fear, and desire. Within such a cli- mate, a construct such as Bhabha’s “colonial identiWcation subject,”  a dialectical union of colonizer and colonized constituted through  “a repertoire of positions of power and resistance, domination and de pendence” (95), is not merely a theoretical abstraction but an accu- rate depiction of the very real indeterminacy underlying postcolonial subjectivity, and therefore a methodological necessity for responsible “cultural” criticism. Even in an era of U.S. global dominance, which has caused some of the more radical Marxist critics to call for a complete epistemologi- cal break from postcolonial frameworks (see, for example, Hardt and Negri, 143–46), postcolonial discourse theories still offer compelling insights into cultural conWgurations as they exist. I would suggest, in fact, that this focus on what is, at the expense of a materialist focus on what ought to be, accounts for at least some of the hostility to post- colonial discourse theory: that postcolonial discourse theory’s great- est crimes, for its materialist critics, have been its unwillingness to masquerade as activism, its open admission of its own irrevocably “cultural”—even institutional—nature, and its insistence on describ- ing interaction rather than prescribing revolution. Whatever one’s standpoint—whether one views these as deWning strengths or fatal weaknesses—one must at least recognize that these are all truths that postcolonial discourse theory has known about itself from the outset (they might, indeed, be regarded as founding principles): they are cer- tainly not, despite what the proponents of the material turn in post- colonial studies might have us believe, novel disclosures that invalidate the wealth of insights discourse-based theories continue to offer the Weld. </page> <page sequence="19"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 120 120 RICHARD BROCK POSTCOLONIAL DISCOURSE THEORY AND APPROPRIATION The question, then, remains as to why these critiques have begun to be successful in “dethroning” postcolonial discourse theory. The an-  swer, I propose, is ironically to be found not in any of the overtly “material” questions they have posed but rather in the searching, probing, “cultural” analyses of the reading strategies adopted by post- colonial discourse theory that underpin the best of the materialist cri- tiques. The one substantial criticism of postcolonial discourse theory that remains to be answered relates to accusations neither of institu- tional complicity nor of apolitical textuality, but to a question com- fortably within the framework of poststructuralist analysis: that of authorial agency. This is a question that postcolonial discourse theory has wrestled with from the moment of its inception (see, especially, Said 1995, 23),7 and, despite appearances, is the one that has enabled its materialist critics to gain a substantial foothold. There is little, for instance, in “Signs of the Times,” the chapter of Parry’s Materialist Critique devoted largely to debunking Bhabha’s critical method, that is especially new or offers any substantial grounds for privileging Parry’s own approach over Bhabha’s. (Bhabha’s critical method, we learn—again and again, through example after example that arrives at the same damning conclusion—prioritizes signifying practices, con- structs colonial experience as primarily discursive, and in doing so tends to elide conXict and enmity in its foregrounding of contact, nego- tiation, and compromised subjectivity. For all its posing as a radical and undermining exposé, however, no claims are made in Parry’s ex - tensive close reading that are not explicitly stated by Bhabha in his own discussions of his work, though the stated aim of his approach— “to provide a process by which objectiWed others may be turned into subjects of their history and experience” [Bhabha, 255]—is casually and disingenuously dismissed as “Bhabha’s interest in re-presenting the colonial encounter as a complicit relationship” [Parry, 67].) What is more convincing, however, is Parry’s discussion elsewhere of Bhabha’s reading of Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks, an undertaking central to Bhabha’s thought. Here, Parry’s criticism of Bhabha is not (as it tends to be elsewhere) simply that he is not Fanon; rather, she draws atten- tion to the ways in which he appropriates and undercuts the agency of Fanon the critic, to the point where he seems to be suggesting that </page> <page sequence="20"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 121 FRAMING THEORY 121 Fanon is not Fanon. Here, far from recovering the agency of Fanon as  a “subject of his own history and experience,” Bhabha appears to turn Fanon into the object of his (Bhabha’s) own critical discussion. This is a far more serious criticism than the vague accusations Parry directs at Bhabha simply because of his adherence to a deconstructive meth - odology, and one to which it is far more difWcult to Wnd an answer. Parry acutely observes that “aspects of Black Skin, White Masks con- genial to Bhabha’s deconstructive practice are abstracted from the body of Fanon’s writings” in such a way that “obscures Fanon’s par- adigm of the colonial condition as one of implacable enmity between native and invader” (16–17), a reading practice that serves merely to “annex Fanon to Bhabha’s own theory” (16). This criticism, more than any other to which Parry subjects Bhabha, is persuasive because it directly engages the textuality of Bhabha’s approach, focusing on the internal ethics of a reading that appears entirely to disregard Fanon’s particularity and subjectivity and supplant it with one that is im posed upon it. According to Neil Lazarus, this is no isolated example, but a con- dition of a Weld in which “the sheer appropriativeness of some of the readings regularly put forward . . . can still make one gasp” (427). If the examples Lazarus cites, where “novelists like Ngugi and Heath and Rao are linked under the unlikely sign of multiculturalism,” or where “we encounter presentations of Wole Soyinka and Kamau Brathwaite as poets closely aligned, in their deepest convictions, with deconstruc- tion” (Lazarus, 427), are particularly grotesque appropriations not just of the authors they discuss but of the postcolonial theorists they employ, it is equally true that a certain appropriativeness of authorial agency is indelibly inscribed into the very fabric of postcolonial dis- course theory, and to this extent its foundational thinkers are at least partially culpable even for the egregious examples cited by Lazarus. It is for this reason that a transparent mapping of the locations of these appropriative tendencies is a matter of the utmost urgency, and such a mapping requires us to return to the frame, that metaphorical device that, located always in the “marginal” space-time of the postcolonial, is uniquely capable of answering those critics of poststructuralism- based approaches to the postcolonial who have taken to referring to them in the past tense. </page> <page sequence="21"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 122 122 RICHARD BROCK A DOUBLE INSCRIPTION: RADICAL CRITIQUE vs. RESPECTFUL COMMENTARY To lead us back to into our frame, another irony: I contend that the appropriative tendency of postcolonial discourse theory lies not in  its supposed retreat to a realm of pure textuality, but rather in its rad- icalism, speciWcally in its often uneasy fusion of poststructuralist  textual approaches and Third World political activism. In the post- structuralist tradition, discourse-based postcolonial criticism operates in a manner consistent with Derrida’s succinct account of the decon- structive critical reading: “The reading should always aim at a certain relationship, unperceived by the writer, between what he commands and what he does not command of the patterns of the language that he uses. This relationship is not a certain quantitative distribution of shadow and light, of weakness or of force, but a signifying structure that critical reading should produce” (1976, 158).8 This type of critical reading, which Derrida contrasts with “the effaced and respectful dou- bling of commentary” (1976, 158), is the one most often applied by the postcolonial critic to the Western canonical work, the means by which the atemporal, reiWed “object” of Eurocentric history is constructed. In this type of reading, the critic is the sole possessor of critical agency, producing or giving rise to new signifying structures contained within that portion of the text beyond authorial control. Yet, as well as a pro- ductive force, the dual lineage of postcolonial discourse theory requires it—unlike the poststructuralism(s) on which it is based—to serve also as an expositorymethod, documenting instances of artistic production that engage critically with the Eurocentric discourses of history and modernity, and in the process Wguring the author as the agent of post- colonial cultural resistance. This second type of postcolonial critical reading respects authorial intent utterly, and thus serves—in the terms of Derrida’s distinction—as commentary rather than critique: (self-) effacing and entirely “respectful.” The complicating Wgure here of course is that of the author: the doubly inscribed movement of the postcolonial reading functions to wrestle the text from the control of the (colonial) author as agent of oppression, Wxity and reiWed spatiality, creatively producing a reading that then opens up space for the (postcolonial) author as agent of resis- tance, Xuidity, and hybrid temporality. In the process, critical agency </page> <page sequence="22"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 123 FRAMING THEORY 123 is transferred to the author, and the productive reading wholly or par- tially effaces itself, emerging in the guise of respectful commentary that outwardly contains only traces of the radical critique that has driven its operations. The coexistence of these conXicting approaches is a characteristic of all discourse-based postcolonial criticism, an inevitable consequence of the distinct reading strategies associated with its antecedents. If, as we shall see in a moment, it is an obvious structural principle of TifWn’s postcolonial counter-discourse, it is much more difWcult to locate in the provisional formulations of a critic like Bhabha. But Benita Parry, in her discussion of Bhabha’s reading of Fanon, has been acute enough to Wnd it here too, and we can appre- ciate its centrality to Bhabha’s critical formulations by brieXy con- sidering the contrasting treatments of two key Wgures in Bhabha’s discussions of hybridity: Salman Rushdie and V. S. Naipaul. Rushdie can be considered something of a standard-bearer for Bhabha’s particular formulation of hybridity. His novel The Satanic Verses offers a fantastical version of a migrant London that both shapes and is shaped by radical hybrid conceptions of nation and city space. Bhabha’s commentary thus contentedly constrains itself within the central ideological thrust of Rushdie’s narrative, and his suggestion “that it is only through the process of dissemiNation—of meaning, time, peoples, cultural boundaries and historical traditions, that the radical alterity of the national culture will create new forms of living and writing” (Bhabha, 239). Bhabha’s reading of The Satanic Verses— combined with his knowledge of, and afWnity with, Rushdie’s migrant positionality and hybrid sensibilites—thus substantiates his statement that Rushdie “remind[s] us in The Satanic Verses that the truest eye may now belong to the migrant’s double vision” (8). Bhabha Wnds this “double vision,” however, in works whose authors view hybridity as a demeaning and degrading state rather than a radical reformulation of binary colonialist discourses, as his read- ing of Naipaul as the basis for his seminal work on mimicry attests. Bhabha’s conception of mimicry, as giving rise to “a writing, a mode of representation, that marginalizes the monumentality of history [and] quite simply mocks its power to be a model” (125) performs a radical reversal of Naipaul’s own use of the term in The Mimic Men, revealing a hidden capacity for resistance in the outwardly faithful conform- ity of colonized peoples to imposed imperialist discourses. Hence the </page> <page sequence="23"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 124 124 RICHARD BROCK central theme of Naipaul’s novel—in his own words a book “about colonial men mimicking the condition of manhood, men who had grown to distrust everything about themselves”—is transformed into something potentially “menacing,” as a result of “its double vision which in disclosing the ambivalence of colonial discourse also dis- rupts its authority” (Bhabha, 126). Such an approach is immediately recognizable as an example of a radical postcolonial critique, effected in the space beyond authorial control, and transcending the limits cir- cumscribed by the author’s “reading” in the act of writing his own work (a formulation to which I will return subsequently). However, when Bhabha enumerates The Mimic Men’s cynical, self-loathing pro- tagonist/narrator Ralph Singh—widely read as an authorial surro- gate, and whose agency, like that of his creator, exists almost entirely in a writing that renders his despair at the postcolonial condition as an impeccable work of art—among those “parodists of history” who “in-  scribe the colonial text erratically, eccentrically across a body politic that refuses to be representational” (126), the radical critical agency that informed the reading begins to be displaced onto Singh, and the reading emerges instead as something resembling a respectful com- mentary on the work of Naipaul, his creator. The coexistence of apparently irreconcilable methodologies within postcolonial discourse theory does appear, on a certain level, to repre - sent an insurmountable problem. Yet the wealth of productive readings that have been produced in its doubly inscribed inner spaces continue to indicate otherwise: that at some level these conXicting approaches operate dialectically; that the tension between them is a highly produc- tive one. Nevertheless, it is clear that some conceptual tool is required to visualize the “third space” in which they might be reconciled, in order to situate this dialectic at the metatheoretical level. Otherwise, a body of theory whose raison d’être lies in the dismantling of imposed binary classiWcations could do no more than displace such oppositions. Anterior to any writing—however hybrid in form and content—would be a simple, binary reading decision: whether to classify a text’s author as “colonial” (an agent of oppression) or “postcolonial” (an agent of resistance), a classiWcation that would incontrovertibly determine the character of the critique (or commentary) that followed. It is to the end of resolving this logical conundrum that I return once again to my proposal of the frame—that entity which tends always to invisibility </page> <page sequence="24"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 125 FRAMING THEORY 125 and self-effacement—as a model for postcolonial discourse theory, and seek to delineate the elements that constitute this inWnitesimal space of critique. As it becomes evident that these elements—far from being anterior to the critical movement from spatiality to temporal- ity—are always generated by it, regardless of whether this movement appears to constitute a radical critique or respectful commentary, the frame emerges as the third space we have been seeking: a space in which the apparently distinct activities of reading and writing col- lapse into a single gesture in which the agencies of critic and author are dialectically uniWed. I propose, then, three key constitutive elements for this space of the frame—critical constructs that are never stable or Wxed, but cir- culate in Xuid, independent “orbits” around that which the frame contains. They might, in fact, form the basis for a metatheory of all poststructuralism-based criticism, but they converge and separate  in particularly striking ways in the spaces of postcolonial discourse theory. These elements are author, culture, and text, and they are con- stantly at play in the discourse-based postcolonial critique, whether Wxed in the same moment of textual production (postcolonial theory in expository mode, offering an “effaced, respectful” commentary on the author as agent of cultural resistance via the medium of the text), or forced into disparate locations to provide the space for a productive, deconstructive reading (postcolonial theory as a radical critique of the known). The frame enables a reconciliation of these two apparently conXicting and contradictory modes by revealing that both emp loy the same elements, within the same plane, to arrive at their disparate formulations. Furthermore, the directionality of these approaches is identical, in that each propels the work, across the mediating boundary of the frame, from the realm of the spatial to the realm of the tempo- ral, the inexorable ideological drive—as Bhabha has so persuasively argued—behind the articulations of postcolonial discourse theory. TEXT, AUTHOR, CULTURE Of the elements that constitute this inWnitesimal, self-effacing space of the frame—text, author, and culture—we have already dealt with the Wgure of the author in some detail. We must, however, wrestle with </page> <page sequence="25"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 126 126 RICHARD BROCK the meaning of the term culture, in an attempt better to understand the full range of activities and conditions that coalesce around this elusive notion in postcolonial discourse theories. As we have already seen, to materialist critics of these theoretical positions, culture often appears to be a problematic abstraction, a reference only to the artis- tic outputs of elites. Given the focus of discourse-based postcolonial criticism on “cultural” production in this sense, such a perception is not entirely inaccurate, and at times appears to be vindicated by crit- ics such as Said, for whom culture functions either to refer to the sum of a particular group’s artistic output or as an exclusionary term re - Xecting a judgment on the quality of a set of artistic artifacts, or both (see Said 1994, xii–xiv). Yet this is an overly simplistic picture, and does not take into account the ways in which culture refers simultane- ously to a second set of more “material,” if equally nebulous, notions: to an aggregate, for instance, of communal practices, economic con- ditions, or shared experiences. Depending on the context for its usage, culturemay therefore refer to a collection of works to which an author contributes, and/or to the contexts that give rise to these works. ReXecting on this duality, we can begin to appreciate the privileged position of “culture” in postcolo- nial discourse theory, as the mediating concept that (imperfectly) links literary or artistic artifacts to the material conditions of their produc- tion in and through the singular Wgure of the author. As I use the term culture, then, it necessarily retains a somewhat Xuid deWnition, reXect- ing its theoretical Xexibility as a signiWer of the customs, conditions, or norms of a particular group of people, whether deWned nationally, denominationally, or by any one of a set of innumerable criteria that can be imagined in terms of community or collectivity. In short, for my purposes culture indicates the combination of sociopolitical norms, material conditions, customs, practices, and discourses that an author may be (reductively) assumed to represent. If we follow Michel Fou- cault’s suggestion that the author represents an “ideological Wgure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning” (2003, 391), or a principle of discursive “rarefaction” (1981, 58), then culture refers simply to the plethora of contextual assump- tions underlying the rarefaction or limiting of discourse that author- centered commentary effects. In the particular context of postcolonial theory, of course, the term culture is a heavily loaded one and stands </page> <page sequence="26"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 127 FRAMING THEORY 127 on a long history of crude essentialist generalization in the service of Eurocentric—often overtly imperialist—anthropological discourses. A critical reading in this context, if it is to avoid reproducing prior essentialist assumptions, must be constantly vigilant in preserving the space between author and culture; conversely, if textual commentary is to (re)construct the author as an agent of anything at all, he or she will inevitably be situated in some “cultural” conWguration or other. Of the three constitutive elements of the theoretical “frame” I have proposed, it is perhaps text that requires the most precise deWnition, not least because it might reasonably be expected to lie inside the frame, rather than to constitute a part of it. It is crucial here to distin- guish between the work, the material object that lies inside the frame, and the text,which is produced by critical reading, and is among those framing entities that mediate between this strictly spatial object and the temporal realm of discourse that lies beyond the frame, and toward which the critical reading inexorably drives. Critical readings enacted by this theoretical frame thus entail a movement “from work to text,” an often-cited phrase given to us by Roland Barthes, whose distinc- tions it is useful to repeat here: “The difference is this: the work is a fragment of substance, occupying a part of the space of books (in a library for example), the Text is a methodological Weld. . . . The work can be held in the hand, the text is held in language, only exists in the movement of a discourse . . . the text is experienced only in an activity of production” (157). Barthes’s treatment of work and text here neatly en - capsulates the distinction that I have been making between the spa- tial and temporal: the work occupies space; the text exists (in deed, Barthes insists, can only exist) in a temporal movement. It is necess ary to change only a single word here to accommodate this passage com- fortably into my own model of the frame—and, I believe, make it more consistent with itself. By asserting, as I have done, that the text exists in a movement toward, rather than (as Barthes suggests) of, a discourse, we can more satisfactorily illuminate the status of the text as a “methodological Weld” and come to a better understanding of the text’s fundamental liminality. Situating the text in an insubstantial crit- ical frame around the work allows us to acknowledge its transitoriness, its ephemerality, and its status, Wrst and foremost, as a component in the process, rather than as the product, of a critical method. The text, then, is liminal in two distinct ways, which are united by the model </page> <page sequence="27"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 128 128 RICHARD BROCK of the frame: it is liminal Wrst because it is a space of transformation, a space that it is necessary to move through in order to produce a crit- ical reading of a work; that is, to free the temporal Xow of the dis- courses contained within the static, spatial entity that is the work. Second, and just as important, the text is liminal because it exists in the ill-deWned region at the limit of the work, that region that I have conceptualized as a dynamic frame that gives rise to the reading. “THE WRITING THAT IS YET READING”: AGENCY, SUPPLEMENTARITY, AND THE PARERGON The framing actions of the three entities identiWed above are perhaps most readily observable in the model of postcolonial counter-discourse, owing to this model’s relative transparency and the consequent ease of pinpointing the moments at which the frame is brought into play. It is in this context that I want to pursue a closer examination of the operation of text, author, and culture as critical framing concepts; Wrst, however, we will allow TifWn to outline the central theoretical tenets of the counter-discursive paradigm: The rereading and rewriting of the European historical and Wctional record are vital and inescapable tasks. These subversive manoeuvres, rather than the construction of the essentially national or regional, are what are characteristic of post-colonial texts, as the subversive is char- acteristic of post-colonial discourse in general. Post-colonial literatures/ cultures are thus constituted in counter-discursive rather than homolo- gous practices, and they offer “Welds” of counter-discursive strategies to the dominant discourse. The operation of post-colonial counter-discourse is dynamic, not static: it does not seek to subvert the dominant with a view to taking its place, but to, in Wilson Harris’s formulation, evolve textual strategies which continually “consume” their “own biases” at the same time as they expose and erode those of the dominant discourse. (18) In order fully to appreciate the signiWcance of the frame to this pro-  cess, we must focus our attention on two intriguing doublings that, almost unnoticed, articulate the central elisions upon which subse- quent critical operations are based. The Wrst concerns what TifWn terms “the European historical and Wctional record” (not, as we might expect, </page> <page sequence="28"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 129 FRAMING THEORY 129 records). The singular term employed here indicates not merely that Wction and history are closely related—that the boundaries between them might be uncertain—but that they are in fact the same. It is not just speciWc histories and/or Wctions that TifWn’s method will interrogate, but the very process of recording and archiving history, which in this formulation is simply one of literary canonization. Much of the power of this model lies in its implicit assumption of a Wctionalizing, reify- ing process by which history is rendered as a work, an entity that we have already identiWed as fundamentally spatial in nature. Thus when TifWn tells us that “the operation of post-colonial counter-discourse is dynamic, not static” (my emphasis), we immediately see its potential as a radically destabilizing, temporalizing counter-balance to Eurocentric historiography. A second elision, perhaps even more striking than the Wrst owing to the absence of a conjunction, is the formulation “post- colonial literatures/cultures.” The complete interchangeability of liter- ature and culture in this construction tells us that the Wnal conWguration toward which the counter-discursive critical gesture works—notwith- standing the in-between spaces that it will exploit in arriving at this con- Wguration—will be generated by an arrangement of text, author, and culture in a moment of “cultural” agency through artistic production. The passage through the critical frame in this counter-discursive pattern inscribes several distinct layers of critical/authorial process into a structure of simultaneity. The Wrst process concerns the post- colonial author’s treatment of a canonical work. In order to “write back” to this canonical work, the postcolonial author must initially take on the role of critical reader, Wrst of all generating a dynamic text from the static work, then reading it both with respect to and in iso- lation from its authorial and cultural contexts so that the discourses contained, suppressed, and excluded by its spatialization of history can proliferate in the space beyond the frame. These are the necessary steps toward a rewriting, which, TifWn suggests, is continually in dia- logue both with the discourses it generates and those that it contests. Counter-discursive writing, however, is an inherently double act: if its radical reading of the canonical work allows it to give rise to a tem- poral, discursive entity outside the frame, we can be aware of this only because we infer it from the author’s writing; that is, in the work he or she has created. The dialogic, Xuid discourse that the critic Wnds in this work is the product of his or her own reading, which necessarily </page> <page sequence="29"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 130 130 RICHARD BROCK occurs after the reading it reads, so to speak, but emerges in the criti- cal writing it generates as simultaneous with that prior reading. For our purposes here, it will be assumed that the text generated by a critic is a qualitatively different entity than the work produced by the counter-discursive author, since the former may be assumed to have as its primary aim the manifestation and elucidation of discourses in a temporal realm. While we have seen that the counter-discursive cre- ative work typically draws our attention to previously suppressed or excluded discourses, their subsequent explication requires a further critical movement. This is especially true when we consider a work such as J. M. Coetzee’s Foe,which is widely regarded as paradigmati-  cally counter-discursive precisely because it documents the impossibil - ity of penetrating the silence of those excluded by a Eurocentric history, its postcolonial critique focused squarely on colonial appropriations of voice. We may readily recognize the critical reading of a counter- discursive work as an example of a “respectful commentary,” in which the discourses recovered from the work are attributed entirely to an intentional manifestation of postcolonial cultural agency on the part of the author. Yet the critic’s construction of this agency is based on a reconstruction of the author’s reading practices: the critic brings his or her own prior reading of the canonical text to this subsequent-yet- simultaneous reading, which embellishes, underwrites—even sub-  stitutes for—the author’s own. The critic’s reading, that is to say,  supplements the author’s prior reading, in the special double sense of the word supplement offered by Derrida, meaning both “to add to” and “to replace”: “The supplement supplements. It adds only to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place-of; if it Wlls, it is as one Wlls a void. If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior de - fault of a presence. Compensatory [suppléant] and vicarious, the sup- plement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-(the)-place [tient-lieu]. As substitute, it is not simply added to the positivity of a presence, it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness” (1976, 145). The supplementary reading that the critic adds to his or her commentary on the act of counter-discursive writing, then, leaves its mark in the critical frame in the shape of the constructed entity author: a surrogate author persona is generated to “read” along with the critic; this author persona aspires to compensate </page> <page sequence="30"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 131 FRAMING THEORY 131 entirely for the irretrievable absence of the “real-life” author, but always falls short of achieving this aim. This much can of course be said of any reading that aspires simply to commentate on, or reproduce ent irely, the author’s original intention. But the importance of this authorial sur- rogate to postcolonial discourse theory—what allows the construct of author to transcend the real-life author’s control over and ownership of his or her work and to propel the text into the realm of discourse beyond the frame—is that the critic invariably constructs the post- colonial author Wrst of all as a reader, whether of that author’s own work, a particular canonical work, or the “works” of modernity and colonialist history. Extending this analysis beyond the counter-discursive paradigm to postcolonial discourse theories more generally, we can see that  the process of critical supplementation is of the same order regard- less of the author’s perceived subject position, though it remains  virtually undetected when the sympathies of the author in question are avow edly “postcolonial” ones. Coetzee’s Foe, therefore, is “meta- counter-discursive” (TifWn, 31) because it reads itself through TifWn’s counter-discursive paradigm; the “migrant’s double vision” that allows Rushdie and his characters their hybrid perspective on postcolo- nial London is of course an identical “vision” to that which informs Bhabha’s own readings. Naipaul, meanwhile, whose own “postcolo- nial” credentials are the subject of intense and ongoing debate, is  (or so Bhabha would tell us) a far better “reader” of the historico- Wctional “record” of his own time and place than he himself is aware. Even such an apparently “un-postcolonial” novelist as Jane Austen is constructed by postcolonial criticism in a similar way: Edward Said openly acknowledges that her novel MansWeld Park “is totally untrou- bled by the slavery and by the sugar plantation,” the historical context against which Said’s own reading of the novel is positioned; never- theless, Austen is a sufWciently attentive “reader” of this historical context that MansWeld Park “contain[s] within itself [the] possibility  of reaccommodating it to something else, to another kind of reading, to a different interest,” a discursive plurality that for Said renders an already “great” work “an even more interesting novel, even greater” (2005, 211–12). These diverse examples illustrate a tendency that is endemic  to postcolonial discourse theories. Regardless of a work’s nominally </page> <page sequence="31"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 132 132 RICHARD BROCK “colonial” or “postcolonial” nature, every work that is of interest to discourse-based postcolonial criticism is of interest precisely because its author is perceived to be Wrst and foremost an astute “reader” of what we have seen TifWn describe—in a now highly resonant elision— as the “historical and Wctional record.” This authorial reading is then supplemented—through reconstruction, addition, amendment, and substitution—by a critical reading, through which the work is tem- poralized and its discourses allowed free and visible movement. The critical supplementation of authorial reading, we have seen, differs only by degrees depending on the “colonial” or “postcolonial” prove- nance of the author; it is always of the same order. It is, Derrida tells us, “in principle impossible to separate, through interpretation or com- mentary, the signiWed from the signiWer, and thus to destroy writing by the writing that is yet reading” (1976, 159). The frame or parergon becomes the site upon which is inscribed not only this imp ossibility but also the processes of supplementarity by which critical reading— albeit imperfectly—circumvents it by dialectically reconciling the (often disparate) agencies of critic and author into a uniWed temporalizing impetus. UNFRAMING HISTORY: AN EKPHRASTIC PARADIGM The observations above, concerning the spatiotemporal movements, enunciations, and operations of text, author, and culture as critical con- structs, demonstrate the validity of the frame as a model for the post- colonial critical reading. However, I suggested that the power of this model derives from its ability to mediate between spatial and tem- poral conceptions of history and modernity. In order to validate this claim fully, it is necessary to examine further precisely how the tem- poral Xows of history become “framed” or reduced to the spatial frame of the art object; how, in short, history is rendered as a work. It is help- ful in this regard to consider brieXy the work of one of the most com- pulsively spatial theorists of history and modernity, the Canadian media critic Marshall McLuhan. McLuhan conceptualizes moments in time—whether historical or contemporary—as “environments,” differing only in their degree of visibility. He suggests that “the really and totally saturating environments are invisible. The ones we notice </page> <page sequence="32"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 133 FRAMING THEORY 133 are quite fragmentary and insigniWcant compared to the ones we don’t see” (49). The “environments” of the past, McLuhan argues, become visible to us because they have been framed for our perception; that is, “[what] once was environmental and invisible has been reprocessed into an art form” (49). The “present,” in this formulation, remains un-  framed, and therefore its organizing structures remain invisible to us, until they too are processed into a digestible “art form.” However, McLuhan speculates that perhaps “we have reached the stage where we have begun to process the environment itself as an art form. We may be catching up with ourselves” (49). For McLuhan, writing in 1967, this shift in perception represents the arrival of modernity, a moment at which new technologies are allowing us for the Wrst time to imagine the time of the present in spatial terms, and hence to frame it as an art object. The paradigmatically modern moment McLuhan describes rep- resents precisely, in Bhabha’s terms, the spatialization of the time of modernity, an instant at which modernity’s intense impulse toward spatialization results not only in its reiWcation of history, but a reiW- cation of its own time as history-in-the-making, through a collapsing of the temporal into a framed artwork. Yet McLuhan’s identiWcation of this process also gestures toward a proto-postmodern moment that, by recognizing the means by which framing spatializes and reiWes history’s discursive temporalities, facilitates a recuperation of tem- poral Xows at the margins of representation. This recuperation, this liberation of temporality from modernity’s repository of reiWed spa- tiality that provides the impetus for the emergence of postcolonial rearticulations of history, parallels what I earlier termed the “Mona Lisa Smile Syndrome,” an impulse toward narrative exposition that cannot be satisWed by the merely spatial. Which is to say, simply, that postcolonial discourse theory is paradigmatically ekphrastic. Ekphrasis, the term that refers to narrative depictions of visual art, is traditionally reserved more or less exclusively for studies of the aesthetic afWnities between visual art and literature, but it is uniquely positioned to articulate the critical movements effected by postcolo- nial discourse theory in the ephemeral frame around the work. Char- acterized by James Heffernan as a “struggle for mastery between word and image” (1993, 6), ekphrasis represents both the frame and its other: it occupies the site of conXict between the spatial and the temporal, </page> <page sequence="33"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 134 134 RICHARD BROCK while resisting and countering the exclusionary, spatializing act of framing. As it is traditionally conceptualized, ekphrastic representa- tion concerns “pregnant moments” in graphic art, here deWned by Roland Barthes: “In order to tell a story, the painter has only an in - stant at his disposal, the instant he is going to immobilize on canvas, and he must thus choose it well, assuring it in advance of the greatest possible yield of meaning and pleasure. Necessarily total, this instant will be artiWcial . . . , a hieroglyph in which can be read at a single glance . . . the present, the past and the future; that is, the historical meaning of the represented action” (73). The Eurocentric “mapping” of history I have been discussing so far may readily be thought of in these terms, as a series of pregnant moments, each spatially consti- tuted, with its meaning, its past, present, and future, already Wxed, in advance of its documentation. Necessarily total, seemingly overXowing with narrative possibility, the pregnant moments of Eurocentric his- tory are nevertheless illusory, artiWcial, their interpretive potential always already determined, encoded into a hieroglyph that requires only a single glance to decode. When considered in keeping with its traditionally aesthetic con- ception, as “an attempt at an iconic embodying of stillness” that “saves action from the impermanence and death that all time objects suffer” (Steiner 1982, 81), ekphrastic representation seems an unpromising counter to this spatialization of history in pregnant moments. How- ever, when Heffernan suggests that, on the contrary, “ekphrastic rep- resentation delivers from the pregnant moment of graphic art its embryonically narrative impulse” (1991, 301), he is, at least by impli- cation, delineating a radical textual strategy, an opening out of a Wxed, spatial history to a plenitude of narrative possibility. When Heffernan goes on to tell us that the “ekphrastic tradition” also encom- passes “prosopopoeia, or the rhetorical technique of envoicing a silent object” (302), it becomes clear that ekphrasis functions as nothing less than a comprehensive shorthand for the aims and operations of post- colonial discourse theory: a series of articulations positioned at the margins of a spatialized Eurocentric history, functioning to narra- tivize, and “envoice,” the silenced, marginal discourses buried within this history. In the closing section of this essay, I will proceed to offer a “snapshot” of ekphrastic representation operating in a counter- discursive postcolonial mode. My purpose here is twofold: I want Wrst </page> <page sequence="34"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 135 FRAMING THEORY 135 to demonstrate, through the use of a work that employs ekphrasis counter-discursively, the appropriateness of ekphrasis as a concep- tual analogue to the temporalizing impetus of postcolonial criticism; second, through a metacritical analysis of the multiple frames—or parerga—that my reading constructs around the work, I want also to demonstrate my own superimposition or supplementation of numer- ous ekphrases in order to (re)construct the counter-discourses I Wnd contained within it. A SAMPLE (META)CRITIQUE: BY WAY OF A CONCLUSION The closing section of this essay focuses on my own reading, within  a counter-discursive framework, of the ekphrastic short story “Death by Landscape,” from the collection Wilderness Tips by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, as a “writing back” of sorts to the “empty wilder- ness” aesthetic of the Group of Seven, an overtly nationalist Canadian art collective active in the 1920s.9 This aesthetic is deeply implicated in a desire to establish a terra nullius, virgin territory for the exploita- tion and recreation of white settlers, and has frequently been linked to the discursive erasure of aboriginal populations that one critic has gone so far as to label “cultural genocide” (Watson, 94). My choice of Atwood as an exemplar needs some justiWcation: even if (as I argue here) Atwood’s more recent work on the wilderness displays a deeply ambivalent relationship with the perpetuation of colonial power rela- tions in contemporary articulations of Canadian nationhood, it is equally true that in early works, such as the inXuential critical work Survival,Atwood contributed substantially toward a settler-nationalist literary mythology based around a wilderness aesthetic heavily inXu - enced by the Group itself. Perhaps more disturbingly, even her recent work has continued to display an alarming tendency to Wgure Euro- Canadians (especially women) as the oppressed party in a relatively straightforward colonizer-colonized relationship between the United States and Canada, thereby eliding the ongoing colonial oppression of aboriginal peoples by the Canadian state.10 It is also true that persuasive interrogations of the complicities of visual representations of Canada have emerged in recent years from the far more unambiguously colonized quarters of aboriginal literature, </page> <page sequence="35"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 136 136 RICHARD BROCK among them Thomas King’s Truth and Bright Water and Eden Robin- son’s Monkey Beach. However, it is the very anxiety and indeterm i-  nacy of Atwood’s work—its exemplary occupation of what Stephen Slemon calls the “neither/nor territory of white settler-colonial writ- ing” (30)—that concerns me here. It is that “violent duality” identi- Wed by Sherrill Grace as integral to Atwood’s oeuvre that makes her work both receptive and challenging to counter-discursive theory, and thereby renders the theory’s framing operations more clearly vis- ible than the less ambiguously situated writing of those who con- tinue to be materially disadvantaged by colonial power relations. It is not by accident, after all, that many of the most celebrated writers of counter-discursive works—among them Jean Rhys, J. M. Coetzee, Peter Carey, and Nadine Gordimer—are similarly in-between Wgures, occu- pying “the radical ambivalence of colonialism’s middle ground”  (Slemon, 34): settler literature owes its existence in its entirety to the Western canon, on the one hand, and to the experience of colonialism (whether from the perspective of the colonizer or the colonized), on the other. In this respect, the settler writer is the archetypal “colonial subject,” brought into being by the colonial encounter, and with no existence prior to this moment. It is in such a context that the erratic nature of the logic of supplementarity underscoring postcolonial read- ing and writing becomes most evident, and that the productive Wction- ality of the constructs text, author, and culture is most clearly exposed. A critical link between the semiotic discussion of the frame I have been pursuing and Atwood’s short story is provided by the art critic Jonathan Bordo. Both Atwood’s story and several of Bordo’s critical essays focus on landscape—or, more speciWcally, wilderness—repre- sentation in the works of the Group. Bordo points to a series of para- doxes in the production of the “framed” wilderness landscape, which he characterizes as “an ordered sedimentation of witnessings—of the ergon, in the ergon, around the ergon. In this regard the pictures of the wilderness are a region where testamentality takes on a special char- acter” (2002, 299). The very notion of wilderness, Bordo suggests, is produced by a framing, which is by nature a strategic exclusion: “The pictorial space as voided human presence is a frame, constituted by the systematic voiding of human presence. That frame establishes wilderness as a way of looking at—and as a way of denying” (1992, 106). The wilderness, Bordo suggests, is by deWnition an absence of </page> <page sequence="36"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 137 FRAMING THEORY 137 human presence, a space without witnesses. Yet, “whatever the mean- ing of the image, the fact of the image proves the presence of the  Subject: the Subject was there. Thus, for the image to exist requires a contact—a ‘being there’ for which the image is a record” (1992, 117), a fact that paradoxically undermines the very nature of the wilder- ness at the moment it is recorded as an image. The wilderness paint- ings of the Group of Seven, therefore, are examples of “the image as a record or trace of the subject—in other words, a symbolic deposit. The symbolic deposit is the trace of the contact: the having been there but also the having-to-be-there in order to record as work one’s being there. The legitimation sits in the contact and the manner of the con- tact” (1992, 117). The “symbolic deposit,” Bordo argues, manifests itself in the Group of Seven’s landscapes through the reWguring of the wit- ness or subjective trace through “an organizing non-human Wgure, paradigmatically a single, foregrounded Northern tree, typically a Jack Pine, iconized as canonic in such celebrated paintings as Tom Thom- son’s The Jack Pine and West Wind and Frederick Varley’s Stormy Weather, Georgian Bay” (1992, 98). The insertion of this anthropomorphic trace that renders the human as landscape, then, marks the erasures per- formed by the Group’s framing of landscape, and it precisely this trace that Atwood identiWes as a weak point in their representative practices, a weak point that allows for the ekphrastic “liberation” of the paint- ings’ suppressed discourses. Atwood’s story opens with a detailed ekphrastic description of a collection of Group of Seven art owned by its protagonist, Lois—a collection of paintings of “convoluted tree trunks on an island of pink wave-smoothed stone, with more islands behind; of a lake with rough, bright, sparsely wooded cliffs; of a vivid river shore with a tangle of bush and two beached canoes, one red, one grey; of a yellow autumn woods with the ice-blue gleam of a pond half-seen through the inter- laced branches” (Atwood 1991, 110). From the bounded, framed space of the paintings, “Death by Landscape” proceeds to deliver a narra- tive concerning the disappearance of a young girl—Lois’s childhood friend Lucy—from a summer camp, where the girls have spent the day emulating what they believe to be native dress and customs, aspiring “to be adventurous and pure, and aboriginal” (118). This doubly-inscribed construction—Atwood’s young white girls masquerading as aboriginal peoples—is, characteristically of Atwood’s </page> <page sequence="37"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 138 138 RICHARD BROCK engagements with her nation’s colonial complicities, hardly unprob- lematic. The conXation of the privileged Lois and Lucy (this is summer camp, after all!) with Canada’s disenfranchised First Nations peoples is a distinctly uneasy one, and constructs a rather crudely essentialist “marginalized” subject. Problematic as it is, however, this construc- tion is also a strategic one, which we can appreciate by considering some of Atwood’s recent writing on aboriginality in Canada. In a lec- ture entitled “The Grey Owl Syndrome” given in 1991 (the same year as the publication of Wilderness Tips), and subsequently published in 1995 as a chapter in Strange Things: The Malevolent North in Canadian Literature, Atwood offered arguably her most detailed discussion to date on the topic of First Nations culture, albeit a discussion framed by white Canadian appropriations of aboriginal identities. Beginning with the example of Archie Belaney, an Englishman who assumed the native alias Grey Owl and lived among aboriginal trappers in Canada’s far north, Atwood goes on to explore a number of similar appropri - ations, including the kind of summer-camp “Indianism” (Atwood’s word) practiced by Lucy and Lois in “Death by Landscape.” Acknowl- edging the hypocrisy of appropriating aboriginal cultural property for white recreation in the context of a genocidal government assim- ilation program, Atwood nevertheless Wnds much to celebrate in the practice, arguing that “the contrast reinforces its value; at least [such camps] created a generation of quasi-Native children, some of whom would grow up to be ardent conservationists and sympathetic to Indian claims once they had made their way on to the agenda again. It’s harder to collude in the destruction of a people and a way of think- ing if you feel that this people and this way of thinking are partly your own” (2004, 57). Read in this light, the disappearance of Lucy—the essentialized embodiment of both “femininity” and “aboriginality”— echoes the Group’s representational erasures of all those who are other to their white, male construction of Canadianness through metonymic association with the hostile wilderness. Atwood’s narrative implicitly identiWes the moment at which human presence is reWgured through the anthropomorphic subjective trace by temporally reproducing the instantaneous erasure of the human as a traumatic narrative of dis- appearance. Thus transformed, the trope of erasure is manifested in the suggestion of a literal body-landscape translation that forms the zero-ground of Lois’s traumatic relationship with the paintings: “But </page> <page sequence="38"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 139 FRAMING THEORY 139 a dead person is a body; a body occupies space, it exists somewhere. You can see it; you put it in a box and bury it in the ground, and then it’s in a box in the ground. But Lucy is not in a box, or in the ground. Because she is nowhere deWnite, she could be anywhere. . . . Who knows how many trees there were on the cliff just before Lucy disap- peared? Who counted? Maybe there was one more, afterwards” (1991, 128, 129). Atwood’s story, then, comfortably Wts the paradigms both of ekphrasis and postcolonial counter-discourse and underlines the afWnities between them. “Death by Landscape” directly engages the silent “objects” of the settler landscape painting, uncovering traces of their elided subjectivity by immersing itself in the discourses of im - perialism, and seeking not to replace these discourses but rather to render them visible by attaching to them a temporal narrative. Unfold- ing from what we have identiWed as the instant at which the wilderness environment and its associated histories of imperialist suppression and erasure are “framed,” and thus rendered as an atemporal art form or work, “Death by Landscape” reverses this spatialization, counter- ing it with its own postcolonial temporalizing impetus. But this is only part of the story. The reading that I offer here exists in a matrix of ekphrases, of which Atwood’s is only one. While I seek to offer a “respectful commentary” on what I believe to be the impetus behind Atwood’s story, my reading hinges on its suggestion of an (implicit) identiWcation of certain representational practices,  of which I am aware only because I have read of them in highly theo- retical art criticism. Jonathan Bordo, the major critical source I em-  ploy, generates his own proto-ekphrasis in identifying a narrative  of “witnessing” encoded into graphic representations of wilderness; I do similarly elsewhere when I characterize the Group’s paintings as documents of a combative struggle with a masculine, warlike envi- ronment. In my commentary on “Death by Landscape,” therefore, I supplement the “real” author Margaret Atwood with my own con- structed version, who “reads” the Group of Seven’s paintings through both of these theoretical frameworks and generates the narrative that I in turn—subsequently, yet simultaneously—read, faithful to the in - tentions of my surrogate “author” only. My surrogate author, who bears the name of Atwood but possesses my own critical motivations and reading sensibilities, is furthermore the author of this story only: if I contend at all with the very different authorial personae I would </page> <page sequence="39"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 140 140 RICHARD BROCK have to construct in reading a critical work such as Survival or a novel such as Surfacing, I do so only insofar as to position Atwood as a re - Xective and revisionist critical reader of these past selves and their works. The shifting of the constructed critical entities in the parergon I place around the work allows my surrogate author to be placed in a role of cultural resistance to the essentialist and exclusionary works of colonialist representation, even as I write between this Wgure and the cultural conWgurations and practices from which the “real” author is historically inseparable. Through the dialectical synthesis of critical and authorial agencies—through, that is, a multilayered process of parergonal supplementation—“Death by Landscape” is ekphrastically transformed from a static, atemporal, framed work to an object of post- colonial discourse, even as it performs the same transformation on a set of landscape paintings. In the Wnal analysis, it must of course be remembered that First Nations peoples are directly present neither in Atwood’s story nor in the Group of Seven landscapes it depicts. If their marginal, suppressed voices are to be recovered at all within such a work, it is through a critical movement at the margins—the margins, that is, which theory constructs at the limit both of the Group of Seven’s paintings and “Death by Landscape”—which temporalizes and thus renders visible the colonialist discourses and practices that led to the exclusion of indigenous presence from the spatial artwork. If my analysis of the temporalizing mechanisms at work in the foregoing reading has demonstrated that appropriations of authorial agency are an unavoidable and integral part of discourse-based post- colonial critique, it has also demonstrated that a sufWciently spatial theoretical approach is more than capable of mapping these appro- priations even as it performs them. Just as signiWcantly, it has demon- strated the continued indispensability of a discourse-based approach to elucidating the complex array of subject positions traversed and inhabited by an author such as Atwood, whose own cultural com- plicity and uneasy ambivalence with regard to Euro-Canadian wilder- ness myths means that her postcolonial critique is always more likely to be manifested in subtle re-visioning than in open and absolute oppo- sition. With its deconstructive gaze turned on its own representational elisions, as well as on those of the works it reads, postcolonial discourse theory therefore remains uniquely placed to offer marginal, liminal </page> <page sequence="40"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 141 FRAMING THEORY 141 articulations, from the margins, by, to, for the marginalized. I end here, then, with a complex, shifting, ephemeral image: that of the frame. Notes I would like to express my thanks to the anonymous readers at Cultural Critique, whose stimulating observations and challenges prompted extensive revisions to this essay. 1. By “postcolonial discourse theory,” a term I shall use throughout this essay, I am referring, approximately, to what has become known more widely as “colonial discourse analysis.” This latter phrase, which broadly references those branches of postcolonial theory that derive from poststructuralist and decon- structionist theories of discourse and representation, has to my mind acquired something of a dismissive air, especially in the mouths of its materialist detrac- tors, whose arguments I align myself against for the most part here. If such a body of theory is to be grouped under a single banner (something I Wnd an unavoidable necessity, given the terms dictated by its critics), it seems to me that the phrase used to refer to it ought to acknowledge its dynamism and currency as a means to theorize the postcolonial, rather than assigning it, anterior to any discussion of its merits or demerits, to a “colonial” past that it is Wt only to analyze. 2. For an entertaining and informative account of the Mona Lisa in the popu- lar imaginary, see Donald Sasson’s Becoming Mona Lisa: The Making of a Global Icon. 3. This is not, however, to suggest that such “commonsense” distinctions are universally accepted within discussions of the relationship between the visual and literary arts. For a particularly vehement rejection of the space/time binary as an essential distinction between the literary and the visual, see W. J. T. Mitchell’s Iconology (1986), especially his chapter on G. E. Lessing. 4. For more on linear perspective and the rationalization of spatial percep- tion, see Henri Lefebvre’s discussion in The Production of Space (1991) of “con- ceived space,” a construct that “too often imitates or caricatures the discourse of power, and that it suffers from the delusion that ‘objective’ knowledge of ‘reality’ can be attained by means of graphic representations,” and whose “distant ancestor is the linear perspective developed as early as the Renaissance: a Wxed observer, an immobile perceptual Weld, a stable visual world” (361). On realist visual art as a “natural” (and hence universal) sign system, embodying Western rationality and spatial control, see W. J. T. Mitchell’s chapter on Ernst Gombrich in Iconology, and also his introduction to Landscape and Power (2002). 5. It should be noted that my positioning of these critics as “poststructuralist” postcolonialists, opposed to the more recent wave of Marxist critics of such posi- tions, is itself not an unproblematic act. While I have followed the now-prevailing trend of distinguishing between what Simon During rather simplistically calls “critical” and “reconciliatory” postcolonialisms (31)—based on whether or not a </page> <page sequence="41"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 142 142 RICHARD BROCK given critic locates discourse as the central site for critique—other boundaries have  certainly been drawn from time to time within this debate. Ironically, TifWn, whose own work I shall argue has given rise to some of the most enabling yet problematic theoretical formulations within what I am calling “postcolonial discourse theory,” has in the past been a vocal critic of deconstructive approaches within postcolonial discussions. For example, in the introduction (co-written with Stephen Slemon) to the anthology After Europe: Critical Theory and Post-Colonial Writing, TifWn referred in condemnatory terms to a tendency toward “wholesale retreat from geography and history into a domain of pure ‘textuality’ in which the principle of indeter- minacy smothers the possibility of social or political ‘signiWcance’ for literature” (x), a position that seems to have a good deal in common with the Marxist cri- tiques of postcolonial theory that I argue against (and position TifWn against) here. For reasons dictated both by length and the necessity of responding speciW- cally to claims made by Marxists about postcolonial discourse theory, it is beyond the scope of this essay to discuss those areas of postcolonial inquiry that occupy a position between the poststructuralist and Marxist “camps,” such as the work of the Subaltern Studies group. It is interesting if not surprising to note that this work, combining a Marxist conception (via Gramsci) of the proletariat with aspects of Foucauldian approaches to historiography and discourse analysis, has been claimed by theorists on both sides of the argument. Selected Subaltern Studies, a collection of the most important work by this inXuential collective, is remarkable also for its framing by the prefatory remarks of both Edward Said and Gayatri Spivak. Predictably, for the former the collective’s major contribution is the con- struction of an “alternative discourse” (vi) to Western historiography, while for the latter Subaltern Studies are characterized by a Derridean deconstruction, albeit implicit, of Western humanism, a reading that repeatedly invokes Derrida’s “supplement” without pausing to consider the appropriative nature of its own supplementations. Aijaz Ahmad is characteristically combative in his dismissal of such readings, emphasizing their Marxist lineage while remarking on “a tren- chant irony in the obviously paradoxical relationship between the way the Subal- ternist project would deWne itself and the way Said deWnes it” (210), a criticism that, if highly presumptive in its assumption that its own deWnition of Subaltern Studies is the correct one, might also be applied to Spivak’s reimagining of the col- lective as deWned fundamentally by deconstruction. 6. See, for example, Said’s reading of Kim in Culture and Imperialism (1994, 132–62). 7. In White Mythologies, Robert Young refers to this anxiety speciWcally in relation to Said’s work, where he identiWes in the latter’s discussions of the author an “articulation of individual instance to the general [which] poses a major uneasy question for Said” (174). Young’s discussion is astute on this point, though, as I argue here, the problem is not limited to Said’s work: indeed, the major difference between Said and many other discourse-based postcolonial critics is his willing- ness to acknowledge its existence. </page> <page sequence="42"> 04 Brock_CC #77  5/4/2011  10:03 AM  Page 143 FRAMING THEORY 143 8. Note here a telling parallel between the “formal and general predicative structure,” whose production Derrida enumerates among the key functions of the parergon, and the “signifying structure” produced by critical reading. 9. I discuss the semiotics of the Group’s wilderness representations, and Atwood’s ekphrastic Wctional treatment of them, in greater detail in my essay “Envoicing Silent Objects: Art and Literature at the Site of the Canadian Land- scape” (2008). The reading I provide here is in part adapted from the one I offer in that essay. 10. Atwood’s 1970 novel Surfacing amply illustrates these traits while also exhibiting a growing anxiety about Canada’s colonial history (if not yet its colo- nial present). Following a young woman’s journey to northern Quebec in search of her missing father, Atwood begins by establishing—in opposition to the American tourists who serve as the novel’s “colonizing” force—its archetypal “Canadians”: the narrator’s missing father and his friend Paul are the kind of wilderness-savvy archetypes popularized by the Group of Seven’s early mentor and associate Tom Thomson, secure in their command of canoes, Wshing rods, and a cornucopia of associated wilderness paraphernalia (the former’s death, like Thomson’s, is even- tually revealed to have been due to drowning). The novel does acknowledge traces of aboriginal presence, but First Nations peoples are relegated to the area’s pre- history: their art survives on rock walls that are now underwater. Thus, even as the novel’s ekphrastic depiction of these paintings insists on the ghostly traces of vanished native inhabitants, it simultaneously reduces their stories to an atempo- ral, spatial moment that belongs (reassuringly) to the distant past, just as the copies of these images the narrator’s father has made consign him to absence, death, and pastness.
