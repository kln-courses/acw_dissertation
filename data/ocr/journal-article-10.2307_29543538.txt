<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RENOVATION OF THE BODY JOHN HEJDUK &amp; THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF THEORETICAL PROJECTS Alberto Perez-Gomez 'The living being had no need of eyes when there was nothing remain? ing outside him to be seen, nor of ears when there was no surrounding atmosphere to be breathed... it was not necessary to bestow upon him hands, nor had he any need of feet. . . and he was made to move within his own limits, revolving in a circle.' ihe pervading symmetry of ancient architecture was a response to the basic form of the human body.2 The body is our undivided A possession, which allows access to reality, now understood as embodied consciousness through the polarization of the 'stuff external to the body.3 In spite of our still prevalent rational prejudices, body and world remain inextricably and mysteriously related.4 The world is endowed with meaning in the immediacy of perception, and it is given a physiognomy which derives from the projection of our body image on to it. This continuity, while constantly shifting throughout history, has been shown to be the seat of reality, preceding individual existence. It would be fair to say that the theoreticians of both modern and post? modern architecture have ignored the implications of the rejection of Cartesian dualism vis-?-vis the human body. Norberg-Schulz, for ex? ample, who claims a phenomenological point of departure, is unable to acknowledge the primordial continuum between the visible and invis? ible aspects of culture.5 No one could dispute today the intention of 'making concrete place as opposed to abstract space'. It is totally irrel? evant, however, to assume that architecture can recover its historical figural quality by isolating the morphological or typological character? istics of buildings or urban spaces which might become a point of departure for contemporary design. These popular applications of existential phenomenology and Heideg? ger's language to architectural theory are superficial and fallacious. In spite of good intentions, they fall back upon an antiquated Cartesian understanding of perception and upon the assumption that the body image of our culture remains unchanged and identical to that initially postulated in classical Greece. Not surprisingly, the arguments for a figural architecture have accepted the elements of classical architecture and traditional types. Most post-modernist arguments in favour of a figural architecture stem from a legitimate concern regarding the limitations of invention, imagination and reductive processes. It is well known that abstraction is a unique and indispensable tool of modern science, and therefore a dangerous component of technological intentionality.6 The abstraction of space, however, when resulting from the reductionist process of Plato planning, has been the main protagonist in the devaluation of the modern city. The anonymous skyscrapers that litter our cities are not identical to the Seagram's Building, but are, rather, superficial formal reproductions of it. 'Designed' buildings usually reflect the pressures of fashion, devel? opers' interests or technological imperatives. Nevertheless, the reduc? tion of architecture to formal styles and technological values should not detract from our appreciation of its potential for profound revelations, which are genuinely related to those attained in painting, music and literature. Modern architecture is only now emerging, and the sugges? tion of authentic meanings for the present and of its potential for the future is striking in buildings such as Le Corbusier's La Tourette, Aalto's Paimio Sanatorium and Villa Mairea, Mies's Barcelona Pavilion or Gaudi's Sagrada Familia. These works refer to a body image which is very different from that of the body in the classical tradition. Modern art has clearly demonstrated a concern for meaning beyond traditional mimesis. But modern man exists in 'u-topia', regardless of the historical debris that may or may not have accumulated in his cities. The problem of dwelling, formulated by Heidegger in terms of orienttion and belonging, has to be reformulated in relation to our reality, not through the nostalgic view of traditional cultures in which meaningful places were disclosed (rather than invented) because the symbolic order of architecture was founded on knowledge and religion. Architecture must address present reality. This demands personal invention and imagination, coupled with the greatest rigour and clarity, in a quest to reveal the archetypal and essential, within the framework of meaning. This process by definition entails a 'bracketing' of that which is irrelevant or superfluous to our culture.7 It is fallacious to pretend, for example, that the archetypal meaning of entry might be recovered by placing a classical pediment over a door. Phenomenology has shown the fallacy of assuming that theory and practice (the mind and the body) relate to one another as in a mechanistic diagram.8 Consciousness is always an embodied consciousness, and the relationship between mind and body is always intrinsic. Theory must provide the words that allow us to ground our architectural work in the totality of our existence, here and now. We think with our hands, with our feet, with our hearts.9 Thinking must be understood once again as. poiein or techne, as meditation-in-action. As Heidegger clearly dem? onstrated, our historical situation demands that we transcend rational metaphysics, and David Michael Levin has shown that we need to re? trieve a new and more radical experience of being.10 Architecture is crucial for this retrieval. 26 AA FILES 13</page><page sequence="2">The essence of man cannot be determined through the traditional metaphysical interpretation of man as animale rationale.11 The 'renov? ated' body can be contemplated only in the existential mode, in terms of the engagement of embodiment and being. (This condition sets a frame? work for our discussion which will be regarded as a limitation from the standpoint of scientific writing. Levin has pointed out that even Heideg? ger, whose brilliant existential analyses of the body were a point of departure for later speculations, thought himself to be deferring the dis? cussion about the essence of 'bodily nature'.) As Heidegger's successors we can perceive how his analyses of perceptual and gestural capacities lead to an ontological understanding of embodiment. In John Hejduk's work the critique of the Cartesian body image and the implicit suggestion of a renovation become clear. The dialectic of his work, dealing with the capacities and limitations of invention and reductive processes on the one hand, and the basis of meaning in language on the other, reveals both the end of classical, cosmocentric or anthropocentric architecture and the potential for an architecture addressing reality ? that is, the continuum body-world. Such a renov? ation of man's embodied existence is indispensable in order for being to prevail over nihilism and apocalypse. Hejduk's outstanding work (now accessible in his recently published Mask of Medusa)12 is proof that architecture survives, in spite of a difficult and precarious existence. His architecture does not avoid the problem of a symbolic order, yet it rejects both reductionism and nos? talgia. Authentic architecture has always enabled man to come to terms with his mortality and to transcend it. Historically, the medium for addressing these concerns has shifted from the diadalon, or magical object, of the pre-classical architect, to gardens, cathedrals, fireworks, temporary buildings and, more recently, drawings and constructions. In other writings I have endeavoured to explain the reasons for the emergence of the theoretical project as a form of authentic architecture in the last two hundred years.13 The epistemological transformations at the end of the eighteenth century signalled a split between myth and reason, the start of positivism and scientism, and the exclusion of God from 'serious' knowledge. Ritual, traditionally the embodiment of myth as a form of collective belonging, was excluded from modern town planning. These forms of public participation were the condition of the effective revelation of 'cosmic place' in the institutions and urban spaces of the city. Ritual constituted the invisible dimension which founded the visible order of architecture. Facing the profound cultural transformations which made architec? ture as an act of symbolic ordering practically impossible in the indus? trialized city after the French Revolution, Boullee confessed that his theoretical projects in the form of drawings were his real architecture, rather than his extensive but rather meaningless practice.14 The myths supporting classical architecture had been eroded by reason, and he understood that architecture, to be valid, had to reflect knowledge in its most profound sense, not as information, but as the visible equivalent of metaphysical orientation. Hejduk's work questions the possibility of its execution at a different scale, in the world of genetic engineering and cryogenic entombment, and in this sense it is in the best tradition of modern architecture, under? standing modern, not as a style, but as a distinct time and place with its characteristic world view. Witness the questions raised in spectators' minds by The Collapse of Time (see pp. 73-82 of this issue of Files). Octavio Paz has pointed out that after the dissolution of the traditional cosmos in the late eighteenth century any authentic form of poetry must also be criticism. This duality pervades Hejduk's renovation of the body and architecture. His projects are a critique of conventional con? temporary practice; his architecture can only be 'experienced' directly, because it represents no reality except its own. The dilemma entailed in building theoretical projects is not unique to Hejduk. Gaudi's architecture, for example, was not 'designed' in the conventional sense. His understanding of techne was profound, as was his comprehension of the phenomenic qualities of materials, which were irreconcilable with the constraints of industrialization. Gaudi also believed in the primacy of mythopoeic reality. Paradoxically, although Casa Mila or the chapel of Colonia Guell are very much three-dimensional and inhabitable, they question their own 'existence' in the context of modern culture because they are not derived from the classical body. The architecture of dreams, though more real, does not 'belong' in a world generally uninterested in transcendence through symbolization. Similarly, Hejduk's work cannot be placed in the realm of perspective, which, in spite of his rejection of Cartesianism, remains the 'site' for buildings. Cartesian perspective space is still assumed to be the space which man inhabits. The 'u-topic', universal space of modernity admits only a residual perception of qualitative 'places' in the traditional sense. Any form of contextualism has, therefore, a very limited scope. We are all tourists and voyeurs in the Piazza Navona, regardless of the frus? trations and limitations that this present mode of 'public life' entails. In this connection, it should be remarked that the ultimate theoretical discipline ? reducing the three-dimensional world to two dimensions ? was indeed a perspective theory.15 The assumption of efficient tech? nological control has isolated the architect from the act of making. John Hejduk's architecture, from the Diamond Houses to the Masques, can be seen as a devastating criticism of this most serious of all evils. His work is the constructions that exist in the in-between realm. It is in the revelation of the diagonal of the square, the apocalyptic reality of modern man, that Hejduk's architecture can be understood. It exists in the frontal axonometric projections of the Bernstein House, for example. This is a concrete architecture which resists any attempt to place it as an object among others in perspective space. Hejduk's archi? tecture transcends the classical distinction between craftsman and architect, to recover the archaic horizon of techne-poiesis. His work finds the archetypal by means of the personal, the eternal by means of the present. It can be perceived only in its own terms, in a realm of perception that is no longer regulated by the Cartesian coordinates of a perspectival world. Thus Hejduk's architecture postulates a renovation of the body which is still obscure in its implications, but which discloses the fragility of the present and the possibility of a future. The dialectic between Hejduk's early work and his late work is particularly crucial to the clarification of the scope of this renovation. It is well known that his earlier work seemed closer to the interest in abstraction of the heroic age of modern architecture, while his later projects have emphasized their search for the figural through colour, texture and, more recently, language. It shows explicitly that the task of the modern architect is, more than ever, a dangerous personal task. The architect must discover order that transcends historical styles, meaning? less technological processes, or the hedonism of empty form. Hejduk's work always refers to the world-as-lived, our primary source of meaning. He uses words in his recent work to search for a figural ground and to tie his concrete poetry of invention to the con? tinuum of history. The theory which reflects the mind of the renovated man is no longer a logos, however. Since the time of Boultee it has become clear that the formulation of architectural intentions in the universe of intellectual discourse can no longer be scientific prose, but poetry. The text has replaced the metaphors which provided the in? visible structure for meaningful architectural order since classical Greece. During the Renaissance, the scientific prose of the treatises disclosed the principles and precepts (mathemata) derived from these metaphors and from the myths which sustained them. Once the cosmos was shattered and man's world view became the void of technologi? cal Utopia, the most enlightened architects attempted to recover the transcendental (semantic) dimension of meaning through the use of poetic texts. AA FILES 13 27</page><page sequence="3">The dialectic of modern architecture exemplified by Hejduk's work has oscillated between silence and the word, recognizing the limitations implicit in the nature of an architectural universe of discourse, no longer predicated on the assumption of an ordered cosmos or the use of meta? phor as a revelation of truth. Between poiesis as making and poetic truth coined in language, Hejduk's architecture has developed during thirty years of intense dialogue. On both levels, it posits the recovery of the poetic as the origin of dwelling. Man's existential condition demands that he be a poet first of all, and only secondly a scientist. In Phaedrus Plato displays an awareness that words can be evil, becoming 'an elixir not of memory, but of reminding'. On the other hand, Heidegger has clearly explained how 'language is the house of Being',16 and Ricoeur has elaborated the notion that there is no symbolism before man speaks, 'even if the power of symbol is rooted much deeper'.17 Everything that is, is known through language. Poetic speech, or naming, is much more than a mode of communi? cation among other modes of equal value. Aristotle recognized the privileged role of metaphor. In his Rhetoric, he postulates metaphor as the fundamental figure of speech in prose, essential to communication. In the Poetics, metaphor constitutes the essential aspect of tragedy, and is seen as the vehicle for mimesis, allowing tragedy to become an effec? tive microcosm in which the spectators apprehend their 'place' in the face of destiny. Acknowledging the ambiguity of the human condition, poetic naming embodies the necessity of displacement, allowing for indirect reference to the primordial, and is therefore the only language which reveals reality. Scientific language, still considered the exclusive means of communicating truth and objectivity, rests on the illusion of reduc tionism and assumes a direct and unambiguous relationship between the human mind and the material world. All human knowledge is con? ditioned by interpretation, and its actual meaning must derive from its ability to orient man in view of an eschatological, ambiguous horizon. Hejduk's architecture is true knowledge in precisely this sense. His Masques have a density and grounding that his earlier work seemed to lack. Through poetic naming, the architecture attains an unfathomable concreteness. The word allows the architect to reveal the ground of the 'thing', of the products of poiesis, and to attain archetypal meanings, thus the abstract becomes concrete and the figural is regained. Without renouncing the personal power of the modern architect to discover essential, abstract geometrical orders through making, the Masques suggest their potential inhabitation, a reinvention of ritual as a primor? dial round-dance, addressing the necessity of universality in meaning. Through language, Hejduk's recent architecture is inhabited with all the dreams and fears of modern man. Poetry speaks in images in order to let us dwell, states Heidegger. Hejduk's vision does just that: it pro? vides existential orientation reflecting the structure of the world and suggesting a renovated body image, while avoiding the classical illu? sion of assuming an objectified unitary body as the point of departure. If Hejduk's work is capable of mirroring the earth and the sky, it is because he acknowledges the concealment and desecration of nature. Only by questioning empirical reality, the common sense of a materialistic history, dogma and opinion, is it possible to re-create the archetypal. The apparent external order described by typologists and historians creates a dangerous delusion whose seductive gloss deters one from searching for the truth within. Hejduk, on the other hand, has adopted a rigorous introspective search as a form of self-knowledge. The power of Hejduk's architecture as presence is a constant which transcends the differences between his early and late work, encompass? ing the full range of modern art, from abstraction to surrealism. The ap? parently contradictory positions represented by abstraction and sur? realism are reconciled. When we open our eyes each morning, we find the world already organized. Our potential for dealing simultaneously with the specific and mutable, on one hand, and the ideal and universal, on the other, is the most significant characteristic of human perception, a mystery which has been revealed and legitimized by phenomenology. We are capable of perceiving the ideal in the specific. Art and architec? ture, seeking to reveal the truth of reality, are no longer condemned to choose one or the other. The end of classicism also meant the end of this dilemma which so much preoccupied traditional philosophers. Hejduk's renovation makes the world possible in this realm of simultaneity, encompassing the absolutely universal and the utterly specific. This is the nature of the architect's concrete poetry and of his archetypal objects. These are pristine intentional objects, or Heideg gerian 'things', whose truth exists beyond all subjective emotions and measurable, objective dimensions. The participants in Hejduk's Masques are more like bodily skins than skins of buildings. They refer in a direct way to the body, but they are not anthropomorphic in the classical tradition. Rather, they take on the qualities of the flesh, as described by Merleau-Ponty. He contends that the flesh is an element in the same way that philosophers used to think of air, water, earth and fire; it is a concrete emblem of a general manner of being which transcends all dualisms: 'My body is made of the same flesh as the world . . . and moreover, this flesh of my body is shared by the world.'18 The constructions may be empty but they are impenetrable, except through the word, because the space contained by the flesh is very shallow, while the space which contains it is infinite. It is the proverbial gap between the face and the mask. This architecture addresses em? bodied perception in a direct way. The body of both the architecture and the participant undergoes a crystallization which engages its fragments in the geometrical essence of architecture, thus allowing man to recover a foothold in the world. Hejduk's architecture is an architecture of objects in drawing or con? struction, complemented by an architecture of spatial qualities through the word. Together, both dimensions provide existential identification and orientation. His architecture is universal and impenetrable. It at? tains meaning, in the Heideggerian sense, by being suspended 'outside' the world of contemporary buildings and sites, always in waiting. In Victims, Hejduk has told us, it is only the sign naming the sign that can exist. On the other hand, when the architect names his archetypes, he allows language to speak, respecting its existential function, and the architecture becomes fully accessible. Thus a concrete poetry emerges, a reinvention of history ? Hejduk's storia ? for the future. Significantly, these observations remain true even when one is in the presence of the large Berlin Masque structures or The Collapse of Time, physically inhabitable but denying the classical scale relationships expected in buildings of such size. The scale and perceptual size of the object represented in the drawings remains identical in the large 'built' structure. This continuity is their salient characteristic. They establish their own distance with the spectator and become contradictory to traditional ritual participation. Hejduk's architecture has posited technique once again as a magical, propitiatory act. His objects, like the daidala in Homeric literature, convey fear and admiration through their metaphysical light. The pro? tagonists of the Masques have a mysterious emanation of being, a seductive power that can create dangerous illusions. Rather than rep? resenting that which is alive, pre-classical daidala allowed inanimate matter magically to become alive. Like Hejduk's architecture, they were thaumata, marvellous animated machines with brilliant suits of armour and scintillating eyes. This architecture is the mimesis of a transcendental emotion. It discloses the possible totality through the fragment. Just as today we have closed the cycle of classical thought, and are traversing the twilight of reason, the image of the body has started to change. The cycle began with myth, then became metaphysics in the form of philosophy and science, and has ended again in myth. It is per 28 A A FILES 13</page><page sequence="4">haps significant, in relation to Hejduk's work and the architecture of the future, that in Homeric language there is no word for the body as an or? ganic totality. The nine different verbs which Homer uses in relation to our function of seeing, for example, do not identify the function itself, but rather illustrate the mode of engagement, the palpable aspects or ex? ternal qualifications of the act of seeing. The human body in the world of the daidalos was comprehended, not as a unit, but as an aggregate of parts, particularly limbs with strong muscles. The body of gesture and motility was thus perceived as an authentic body of understanding. Our renovated body image can only be grasped analogically, in? directly, through the very instruments and objects that mediate between the body and the world, capturing the footprint of the embodied con? sciousness. David Michael Levin has dedicated a brilliant book to the retrieval of this body of understanding which our dominant philosophi? cal-scientific tradition has kept in concealment.20 This retrieval is two? fold: on the one hand Western tradition has suppressed the life and truth of the body, while on the other the mainstream of this tradition has steadfastly excluded an ancient spiritual wisdom which speaks in arche? typal and mythopoeic language about the body's ontological under? standing of being and of the ways to bring it forth. What Levin (with the help of predecessors) accomplishes in phil? osophy, Hejduk makes visible in his architecture: the retrieval of the human body as the authentic place-holder and the metaphor of tra? dition, as maker or craftsman and as poetic inhabitant. This retrieval implies both a radical break with the dominant classical tradition and also a renewal 'which makes contact with, and continues, that which has always inhabited the most concealed interiority of the prevailing form of the tradition' .21 An authentic interest in architectural meaning in our times must be accompanied by a conscious or unconscious renovation of the body. As an exemplary work of modernity, this renovation is manifested in Hejduk's work, particularly in his profoundly moving later projects. In our dark age, this manifestation is a welcome sign of hope. This article consists of excerpts from a lecture given at the Architectural Association in March 1987.

This Cartesian assumption is at the root of modern architecture's identification of theory and methodology, and of its concomitant belief that theory had to be validated in terms of its applicability (the obvious failures of Durand's theory). This has en? tailed the reduction of true theory to the status of applied science, a reduction which was supported by the parameters of a technological world view.
