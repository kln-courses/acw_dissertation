<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE BY KLARA KELLEY AND HARRIS FRANCIS Every inch ofground, all vegetation and the fauna on it are considered sacred. There are no places that are holier than others. There are so many stories that go with the land that it would take more than twenty years to tell them. [Gives names of local sacred landmarks.] The Water Monster, a holy being, made the Tsegi Canyon and lived in there. He used one of his horns to dig the channel where Laguna Creek now flows. There is never supposed to be any dispute about the water, but like everything else, there are disputes about the land on which the stream flows. The Holy People put us here and the people considered all things sacred, the land, plants, and animals-we are their children. When it is cold, we burn the wood, which keeps us warm. We cook with it in order to eat, to keep us from getting sick. We use the plants for medicine and to smoke. We pray with the smoke. Learn the prayers for the plants, and you can use them to help yourself and other people. [The Black Mesa Mountains are another sacred area.] It is said to be the body of the Female Pollen Range lying there. It is there to protect the people. The Navajo people were told by the holy ones to leave it alone. Now the coal companies who hire Navajos have come in and are strip mining the mesa, desecrating it. This coal is said to be the blood of the Female Pollen figure lying there. This coal is considered sacred. Young Navajos help in digging up the coal today. They burn the coal for heat, and use it for cooking, breathing in the fumes from it. This causes many different kinds of sickness. You hear about the people working in these mines become sick with cancer. The desecration of Black Mesa will burn out our souls one day. Today when we try to teach the young people about these impor- tant things, they will not listen to us. We, the Navajo people, are travel- ing on the same road the Anasazi traveled. The Anasazi were placed here before us. They were a part of us also, only their language was a little different. As time went on they stopped listening to the holy ones and did everything they weren 't supposed to. They continued their bad ways, and in time they actually developed wings and could fly. This made the immortal beings very angry, angry enough that the immortals destroyed the Anasazis. They had become too crazy. That is why they are gone now, only their houses and graves remind us that they were here. We Nava/os were then put here by the immortals. The Anasazis were given corn and other necessities needed to sustain life. This was not destroyed with them. This corn and other foods were then given to us.

THE STUDY In 1986, the Navajo Nation government created the Historic Preservation Department to help care for the cultural resources of the Navajo Indian people-places and landscapes important to the Navajos and other Indian communities, archaeological sites, historic buildings, objects, even "intangibles" like oral history and customs. One of the first tasks for the department was to learn about "grass roots" Navajo historic preservation concerns. In 1986 and 1987, as employees of the Navajo Nation government, we talked with people in various parts of Navajoland about what kinds of cultural resources they think are worth preserving and why (Downer and others 1988, 1989; Downer 1989).1 The project involved thirteen local communities, called chapters, in New Mexico and Arizona. The chapter is the smallest unit of Navajo self- government. At the time there were 109 chapters (now 110), averaging 1,500 to 2,000 residents. Chapter meetings occur at least monthly. Each chapter has officers and a full-time chapter manager who administers daily business. Each chapter makes up all or part of the district represented by a delegate to the Navajo Nation Council, the Navajo law-making body. The chapters where we worked were Navajo Mountain in Arizona and Utah; Leupp, Tsaile-Wheatfields, Kayenta, Tuba City, Indian Wells, and Blue Gap-Tachee in Arizona; and Beclabito, Sanostee, Toadlena, Sheep Springs, Nenahnezad, and White Rock in New Mexico. We chose these chapters because they seemed to have a good geographical spread and range of economic development. Some rough geographical-economic indicators of each chapter's involvement (or at least possible involvement) in the non- Navajo world show that these chapters represent the range of economic development in the Navajo Nation: miles of paved road for each 10 square miles of chapter area (the thirteen chapters range from no paved roads to 1.5 miles of paved road per 10 square miles, compared with the Navajo Nation average of 0.8 miles), number of commercial businesses in each chapter (the thirteen chapters ranged from one to forty-five; only six of the 109 Navajo 152 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VOL 17(2)</page><page sequence="3">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE Nation chapters had ten or more businesses at the time), presence of a large employer in the chapter area-one that could employ at least a few dozen local residents (range is zero to two among the thirteen chapters; most Navajo Nation chapters lack a large employer), paved road distance to nearest off- reservation "border town" (ranged from 15 to 160 miles; range for all Navajo Nation chapters is 5 to 160 miles) and to the nearest federal and Navajo Nation government headquarters (agency) (the thirteen chapters ranged from 0 to 90 miles, which is the same as the range of all chapters). Of the thirteen chapters, Tuba City seems to have the greatest possibility overall for contact with the "outside world," followed by Kayenta and Nenahnezad. Navajo Mountain seems to have the least possibility for outside contact. Field Methods: We started fieldwork in each chapter by contacting chapter officials-the officers, Navajo Nation Council delegate, or both. We followed up these first contacts by attending meetings of residents in some chapter areas. Some chapters assigned an official or volunteer to show us places of concern. In most chapters, either the officials or the residents in the meeting gave us lists of people to interview. They apparently assumed that the concerns and places important to these people would adequately represent the chapter. We intentionally avoided imposing a uniform procedure for choos- ing people to interview in all chapters. Since our purpose was to find out the concerns of community members, we didn't want to prejudice the result by dictating how the chapter would give us the information. Of the eighty-one people we interviewed, about one in four was a middle-aged chapter official, whose concerns leaned toward community development. The rest were older people steeped in knowledge of the land and Navajo culture. Their concerns leaned toward preserving the land and culture. The interviews were "open- ended," that is, after we explained why we were asking them for help, the interviewees would take control of the conversation. Most of the interviews were conducted in the Navajo language by a pair of researchers (usually the authors), at least one of whom is fluent in Navajo. Interviews were taped if the interviewee was willing.2 Most of the interviews occurred at the homes of the interviewees. Whenever possible, we also visited the places with the person who told us about them. Otherwise, we visited the places on our own. We located all places on United States Geological Survey topographic maps, photographed them, and made various field notes (including plan maps of archaeological sites). The differences between the chapter with the most possible connec- tions "outside," Tuba City, and the chapter with least such connections, Navajo Mountain is worth noting. Because of the Tuba City chapter's centralized approach to identifying places (having one of the council delegates show us everything), there we interviewed the fewest people and identified the most places per person interviewed. Because of the Navajo Mountain chapter's extremely decentralized approach (giving us a list of a couple of dozen elders and having a chapter employee accompany us to introduce us), we interviewed the most people there and identified the fewest AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2) 153</page><page sequence="4">KELLEY AND FRANCIS places per person. It is tempting to think that the difference in the two chapters' approaches reflects differences in their connections to the outside world. We did not come to that conclusion, however. Indian Wells and Leupp also took a rather centralized approach and yet are not as connected as Kayenta and Nenahnezad, which followed Navajo Mountain's approach. We don't know what caused some chapters take the more centralized approach. We do think chapter officials tended to mention more "historic" (public) buildings and potential tourist attractions than did the old people to whom chapter officials referred us. The chapters where the largest proportions of "historic" buildings and tourist attractions were mentioned are the chapters where officials gave us the most information, but they are not necessarily the chapters most connected to the outside world. Results: Mamie Salt, whose statement appears at the beginning of this paper, was one of the people who helped us. Her statement typifies the concerns that people expressed to us and the contexts within which people told or referred to stories.3 Most interviews unfortunately occurred in the spring, summer, and fall, when, as many people pointed out, you're not supposed to tell sacred stories. While some people gave us more, and more detailed, stories than we expected, many didn't tell these stories in the detail that some scholars have recorded. Instead, many people only summarized or alluded to these stories, or even evoked them simply by naming a person (usually immortal) or incident in the story (compare Basso 1990)-not only because it was the wrong season for storytelling but also, more important, because of how we approached people-asking about protecting places, not "tell me a story" to record the most complete version that the teller is willing to give. Further encouraging people to give stories only through summary or allusion was their desire to tell their concerns about "economic develop- ment" and recent events as they are affecting the landscape and Navajo culture in general. The stories are subordinated to this larger context, as locations where many Navajos use ceremonial and other customary measures to cope with changes imposed from national, even global, society. The allusions to stories give statements like that of Mamie Salt a very compressed, almost infinitely unpackable quality, as one recalls the stories that she alludes to, then the branching networks of possible associations with each person, symbol, and so forth in each story. For example, the reference to the Water Monster in Mrs. Salt's statement calls to mind the Navajo story of the creation of the earth, the Navajo and other people, and Navajo customs. After Coyote stole the Water Monster's baby, the Water Monster caused the flood that drove most beings from the lower world up a giant reed to the present earth's surface, then used its horn to drain the floodwaters from the land. The Water Monster is also associated with rainmaking ceremonies, certain sacred stones that are offered to it during those ceremonies conducted at springs where one's prayers can most directly reach this immortal being. The reference to Black Mesa as the Female Pollen figure calls to mind how, after the Emergence, First Man, First Woman, and other immortal beings 154 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2)</page><page sequence="5">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE placed specific landforms (including Black Mesa) on the surface of Navajoland and gave them certain epithets (Female Pollen figure). The Anasazis were the prehistoric residents of Navajoland, and they emerged with First Man and First Woman, later to be destroyed by winds or other forces unleashed by the immortals. Changing Woman appeared miraculously on one of the moun- tains that the first people had just put in place and grew up to take over the task of creation. She gave birth to the Hero Twins, who later ridded the earth of the monsters that had killed off most of the inhabitants, then created the progenitors of the Navajo people (see Yazzie 1984, Benally 1982, and Wyman 1970). Mrs. Salt's statement thus recapitulates the main episodes of the creation story entirely through allusion, so that the creation story implicitly becomes the context from which the places she names gain their importance. Through stories and statements like Mrs. Salt's, we learned about 164 important places in and near the thirteen chapters. This is about one place for every 26 square miles. As our own experiences and other studies show, such places sit much more densely on the land than that. If we had interviewed more people and included all the places on which each family pegs the story of its past, each medicine person collects materials for ceremonial use and makes offerings to the immortals, and so forth, we would have learned about tens or even hundreds of thousands. It's useful to describe these places according to both what they look like and why people consider them important. We can't offer a Navajo "emic" typology of these places because no one offered an explicit typology and we didn't ask people to help us draw out typological distinctions that might be only implicit in (or even absent from) their statements. We describe the places in terms of what they look like because that seems most accessible to most readers. We describe them in terms of their significance because that is closest to the contexts in which the people themselves described the places. In terms ofwhat they look like, most places are features of the natural landscape (on which evidence of human use is incidental to their signifi- cance): mountains, hills, rock outcrops, canyons, springs and other bodies of water, natural discolorations on rocks, areas where certain plants grow, mineral deposits, isolated trees, places where rocks produce echoes, air vents in rocks, sand dunes, flat open areas, lightning-struck trees and rocks. Another common type of place consists of those where Navajos have left evidence of customary Navajo activities-certain types of cairns, traps for ceremonial hunting of antelope, deer, and eagles. People gave particular locations of these sites and the natural features of the landscape. Other sites- abandoned family homesites, locations of most ceremonies, graves, sweathouses, corrals, cornfields-are so widespread that we didn't ask for or record specific locations except for such sites where unusual uses or events occur. People mentioned certain prehistoric Anasazi archaeological sites- usually ruined masonry pueblos, sometimes petroglyph panels. Still another large category of places consists of "historic" buildings, "historic" sites, or "historic" districts-places with public functions such as trading posts, missions, schools, government buildings-either standing or reduced to archaeological remains. We will call these hereafter public AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2) 155</page><page sequence="6">KELLEY AND FRANCIS buildings or central places. "Historically significant" places are places linked to the past and Navajo custom that are also related to what is important to the lives of Navajo people today. In terms of significance, most of these places, especially the natural landscape features, Navajo archaeological sites, and some prehistoric Anasazi archaeological sites, are important because they are where people have performed the activities that keep Navajo life going and because stories go with them. At these places, people offer prayers or gather water, plants, minerals, and other natural materials for ceremonial use, food, medicine, or handicrafts, and so forth. The sites of daily life (dwellings, cornfields, and so forth) also have this significance. Often, people choose a place for customary activities because "a story goes with it." These places are connected to Navajo origin stories, family stories, stories about some other event that conferred some special power on the place. There are also certain basic tenets of Navajo cosmology (although most interviewees didn't explain these to us) that ascribe special power to certain events or processes in the natural world (for example, lightning strikes, first rays of dawn). Places on the landscape where these processes occur, especially where several occur together or are somehow aligned, are thought to have special power. Battlefields-sites of colonial (often intertribal) warfare-belong in this group because they have special, harmful power from the killings. A few places, mainly public buildings and central places, are important because they are connected to the recent past of the local community as a whole. Some people consider these important because they might attract tourists and their money. A few natural landscape features might be called "natural wonders," places with unusual natural characteristics apparently unconnected to stories or customary practices. It is important to note that many people mentioned customary activities at many natural places without saying anything about a story, but we believe that most of these places do have stories. The same may be true of the "natural wonders." It's also worth noting the multiple, synergistic significance of battle sites and refuges. Because warfare was an important part of Navajo life-from the killing of the monsters by the Hero Twins, to early Spanish colonial period that began around 1600, to the United States Army's conquest of the Navajos in 1864-much Navajo ceremonial practice is also linked to warfare. Places where Navajos in recent generations successfully hid or defended themselves, especially mountains, became validated by those events as good places for ceremonial practices linked to warfare. Certain prehistoric Anasazi archaeological sites are important be- cause "a story goes with them" or because ceremonial materials are gathered from them. Others, however, are of concern mainly because they attract visitors for better or for worse, either tourists desired as patrons for local businesses, or undesirable pothunters and tourists who trespass on one's grazing area. Other studies have recorded Navajos who believe that all such sites, even those without stories, are homes of certain immortals, Talking God 156 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2)</page><page sequence="7">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE and Calling God, and are therefore sacred (Mitchell 1978; Francis and Kelley 1993). Of the 164 places, fully three out of four are significant because they are linked to Navajo stories, Navajo customary activities, or both. We will hereafter call these "sacred places," a translation of the Navajo term dahodivini applied to places with these sources of significance. We remind the reader that "sacred" in the Navajo context embraces much more than it does in the national principle that separates "church and state." One could almost say that Navajo life and the stories and beliefs and customs that go with it are Navajo religion. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Culturally Significant Landscapes: When we started our work in the thirteen chapters, we expected people to answer questions about what local places are important to them with lists of places. Instead, as the statements in the preceding chapter show, people told stories, or at least alluded to them, about Navajo origins, about Navajo encounters with colonialism, about their own personal encounters with immortal beings. The names of places are embedded in these stories, which explicitly tie many places together into landscapes or allude to or imply other, related stories that involve other places and landscapes. The people we talked with don't think of these places as isolated locations. Important places are unlikely to be isolated. A place is usually important because it is part of a larger landscape constituted by a story, customary activities, or both. Clearly understanding that we saw our purpose as developing an "inventory" of"significant places," more than one person tried to correct the "piecemeal" perception of the landscape they saw in this purpose by saying, like Mamie Salt, "the whole land is sacred." Since the same people told stories that refer to specific locations, they clearly weren't saying that there are no qualitative differences among places. They were instead trying to tell us that you can't isolate a particular place as being more significant ("sacred") than another-places each draw their particular distinct significant qualities from their interrelations, from how each functions in the overall system ("the whole land") that sustains the Navajo people and way of life. Several concepts-sometimes explicit, but more often implicit, in people's statements-seem to organize places into culturally significant landscapes. We have already mentioned two such concepts: stories and customary (usually ceremonial) activities. The places where successive episodes of a particular story or set of interrelated stories occurred make up a culturally significant landscape just as the episodes make up the story. The places where activities related to a particular ceremony occur make up a landscape just as the activities make up the ceremony. Places often make up landscapes that symbolize various important groups in Navajo social structure and their interrelations. In the words of AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VOL 17(2) 157</page><page sequence="8">KELLEY AND FRANCIS Navajo teacher and writer Grace McNeley (1987:163-164): The Navajo term ktft'oot-derived from k6, meaning "feet," and trootmeaning "root system"-expresses the concept of having a foundation for one's life in the earth, much as a plant is rooted in the earth ..... Let us visualize the central root as extending all the way back to Asdzain Nadleehi, "Changing Woman"-who is Earth Mother herself. Developing from this main root is the complex web of kinship relations extending back even to ances- tors and including clan relations, the extended family and the immediate family. Tied to this system are material goods, familiar surroundings and livestock. This webbing of earth, of ancestors, of clan and familiar surroundings all constitute a Navajo home, enabling those within it to flourish, to thrive. These thoughts reflect the objective bonds between the land and the people who have customarily produced food and met other basic needs from the land. The flow of family labor into the land produces livestock and crops that each family member consumes. The land, water, air, and sunlight that go into the family's food become the people's flesh. Among these substances are also the essences of the immortal beings like Changing Woman. By consuming the products of the land, one also incorporates the essences of the immortal beings into one's flesh. Particular spots or areas on the land bases of various groups within Navajo society symbolize this relationship of the land and the particular group. To symbolize the land base of the Navajo Nation as a whole, Navajos commonly mention the four sacred mountains associated with the cardinal directions and the outer limits of Navajoland, often together with two others in their midst, the birthplace and home of Changing Woman. These mountains symbolize also the largest social unit in preconquest times, the tribe. They figure prominently in the creation story. They have names. Other places named in the creation story would also symbolize the tribe. A landmark may also symbolize the loosely organized network of several extended families that occupy neighboring or interfingered patches of land surrounding the landmark. As mentioned above, during raids and warfare in preconquest times, people living around a mountain massif would flee to its upper elevations. People still pray from the tops of these mountains for protection, especially when they are about to travel far from home (as during military service). To symbolize the land base of individual extended families, the people we have interviewed commonly mentioned particular homesites and gravesites of members, and also landmarks (such as rock outcroppings) around which generations of the family have built and abandoned and sometimes reoccupied homesites, while they herded and farmed. These and other places within an extended family's land base are where its members may offer prayers. These places symbolize and validate the family members' rights to use particular lands and embody the family story. 158 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2)</page><page sequence="9">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE Even places that don't symbolize territories of social groups but do figure in the history of the Navajo people as a whole or various social groups without territories, in some sense symbolize the associated group. These places include locations of certain events in the creation story, clan origin and migration stories, origin stories of ceremonies. They also include some public buildings and central places. These have a comparable significance in the hazy zone where Navajo culture and that of the colonizers meet. They symbolize the local communities of which they are the central public architecture. This seems to be one reason that people told us these buildings are significant. Sacred places that are not connected with stories about social groups may still be connected to the activities of such groups. Many of these places provide raw materials for ceremonies or are places for ceremonial offerings. The use of these places helps keep alive ceremonies that contain Navajo stories both in verbal performances during the ceremonies themselves and in the origin stories of the ceremonies that medicine people learn when they learn to perform the ceremony. Since extended families sponsor these ceremonies, and the larger ones may attract most of the other families in a locality, these ceremonies strengthen the ties that keep these social groups and networks alive, not to mention the social ties between the humans and the immortals with whom ceremonial acts are the proper form of social interaction. People also identify zones and spots on the larger landforms and in the surrounding country (commonly entire hills, mountains, and canyons) that some people say have too much sacred power for residence, grazing, and other everyday uses. Such uses should therefore be limited in these places, if not forbidden (many voiced dismay at neighbors who have moved into these preserves). They consider these zones storehouses of medicinal plants and natural materials for ceremonial and other customary purposes. The power of these landforms makes people prefer them for gathering raw materials for religious use, even water, earth, and plants common everywhere, because the power of the zones gives extra strength to whatever comes from within them. Besides their connections with the landbases of various social groups and with events or figures in stories, many points where people offer prayers and do other religious activities are chosen for ceremonial uses because certain important attributes of the larger underlying landform are most intensely evident at these spots, and especially because the essences of the immortals-moisture, earth, the air and light (Reichard 1963; J. McNeley 1981; Farella 1984)-come together at these places. For example, the land's capacity to give life-giving water and various plants is most evident at springs and the confluences ofdrainages. Many other places are chosen because there the landform interacts with certain important natural forces. For example, besides being refuges for local communities, mountaintops are where the dawn's first rays strike, and they gather the rain for the surrounding country. The tops of mountains and mesas also seem to be favored for prayers that relate to the surrounding country within view and the growing things upon it, such as livestock. These places, then, are the focus of activities that benefit the surrounding landscape. AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2) 159</page><page sequence="10">KELLEY AND FRANCIS Certain types of sacred spots, such as gathering places for ceremonial raw materials and places for offering certain types of prayers, are more likely to occur in the sacred preserves. Other types of sacred spots more closely linked to daily life are more likely to occur in or near homesites, cornfields, and grazing areas. These places remind one of the extended family's past and present dependence on its customary land base. Although some types of sacred places are more likely to occur in the religious preserves and others are more likely to occur in the residential-grazing-farming zones, sacred places of all types can be found in both types of zone. Illustrating Grace McNeley's statement quoted above about the physical processes that flow between the people and the land, many (probably most) of the sacred places on the land are where people give something back to the land (and the indwelling immortals who make the land alive) in exchange for the life-sustaining things that people take from the land. This is another reason why one cannot grasp the full significance of a place by considering it in isolation from the surrounding landscape. It isn't these places that are sacred in themselves. They concentrate power from the landforms on which they sit, whether those landforms are the powerful religious preserves or the life-giving areas outside them where people have their homes, farms, and grazing lands. Through these interrelated symbols, stories, and activities, people never forget that they exist within, and function as part of, a very large, complex world that includes other groups of Navajos and non-Navajos, the earth and the different landforms upon it, the celestial bodies, the atmo- sphere, and the immortals who animate them. People thereby see themselves as part of much larger organisms. Do these places really have the importance that people say? Non- Navajos often ask this question, especially about sacred places. Yes, they do. Having talked with the people face-to-face, we are convinced of their sincerity. For the skeptic, we offer the following corroboration: We have yet to compile the many references to places scattered throughout published works on particular Navajo ceremonies and the stories that go with them. More general printed sources on Navajo sacred places, however, mention 64 of the 164 places that people told us about, including 30 of the 124 sacred places and "natural wonders."4 The 30 places that the literature identifies as sacred include three places identified to us as natural wonders. Three chapters (Navajo Mountain, Indian Wells, and Tuba City) were parts of larger districts where Walter Vannette (1988) studied sacred places very intensively. Vannette lists 18 of the 20 sacred places mentioned to us. Moreover, of our 164 places, 39 were mentioned by more than one person in separate interviews or, in a few cases, collectively by the chapter organization. Of these 39 places, 27 were sacred places mentioned by more than one person in separate interviews (one out of every four sacred places mentioned). The literature (supplemented by our own field observations) revealed more cultural resources that people didn't mention spontaneously and that we didn't ask people about. These sources mention some Navajo sacred places as well as other places more likely to be significant to the colonizers than to 160 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2)</page><page sequence="11">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE Navajos. Excluding Vannette's (1988) study of sacred places, these sources mention 72 places in addition to the 20 we specifically asked about. Of the total 92, 16 are reportedly sacred to Navajos. Moreover, Vannette, besides recording almost all the sacred places that people mentioned to us and many of those in the literature we consulted, lists about 200 places in the Navajo Mountain chapter area and about 150 to 200 in the Tuba City chapter area (but only one in the Indian Wells chapter area). Why didn't people mention these other places to us? An adequate answer requires the comparison of purposes and field methods between our study and Vannette's and other similar ones, which is beyond the scope of this paper. Reasons include differences in field methods, time spent, people (especially old people and medicine people) interviewed, and the purpose of each study as the people understood. PRESERVING THE CULTURE BY PRESERVING THE LAND: THE "LANDSCAPE" AND "PIECEMEAL" APPROACHES This section covers the most general "historical preservation" con- cerns that Navajos expressed in both our thirteen-chapter study and many other studies.5 These concerns are: That Navajo culture is in danger of dying out, that whole landscapes are significant, and that no one place is more significant than any other. These general concerns are all related as follows. Economic develop- ment is undermining Navajo culture by disturbing or destroying important places on the land, by disrupting the customary activities on the landscape through which people integrate the various places on their landbase into the system of Navajo life, and by seducing younger people away from the Navajo way. Preserving places important to Navajo people can help preserve Navajo culture. To be most effective, preservation efforts must widen their focus from the specific place to the culturally significant landscape within which each place functions and from which it gets power and to which it gives power. A focus on places isolated from their landscape contexts also allows preservation bureaucrats to try to assign different levels of significance to each place to justify not preserving certain places. Preservation efforts that focus on places but ignore their associated landscapes run the risk of saving the places while letting the living context be destroyed, as in a strip mine (like the one Mamie Salt mentions) that "islands" or "pedestals" the family graves that people won't consent to have moved but evicts the living people and turns the land into an uninhabitable moonscape. Without Navajos living the customary life on the land, the places will no longer be part of a living cultural system and the landscape that it animates. They will only commemorate the past existence of a dead culture. In a nutshell, most of the people whose ideas are expressed in these studies don't want "historic preservation" efforts to preserve mementos of "traditional" Navajo culture. They want those efforts to help keep the Navajo way of life itself alive. The Navajo way can't survive unless its practitioners AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2) 161</page><page sequence="12">KELLEY AND FRANCIS have some control over the whole landscape that they need to live. That's why they insist on the "landscape" preservation as opposed to "place" preserva- tion. Here is where Navajo statements about the Anasazis come in. Although some people, like Mamie Salt and the late Navajo Blessingway singer Frank Mitchell (1978:178-179) see them as "part of us" or originators of some Navajo ceremonies, the Anasazis lived badly and therefore the immortals swept them from the land, breaking the bond between the people, culture, and land (see also Wyman 1970:58-59).6 The ruins commemorate a living relationship between the land (or its immortal inhabitants) and the mortal Anasazis, a relationship that died when the bond was broken (although a few immortal Anasazis in the form of Talking God and Calling God inhabit the ruins, according to Mitchell, and help Navajos live). Anasazi ruins to some Navajos are a memento morior a warning. Navajos don't want their own places to be like that. This discourse is an example of a much more general, repeated, never yet resolved discourse that Gill (1987) finds between Indians and Euroamericans. Here [in the discourse of the late nineteenth century], as through- out the history of contact, the issue is land, the earth. This issue continues the imagery of savagism versus civilization. American policy centers upon the transformation of native hunters (gather- ers and fishers) into cultivators (miners and builders). It is an issue of property and ownership. In the native lifeways the land is not divided and owned as personal property, while this divi- sion, settlement, and personal ownership is essential to European- American ways of life. The issues, the contrasting imagery, changed little as the United States spread across the continent (pp. 63-64). Various Indian statements in this late nineteenth-century discourse involved: [T]he notion of the chieftainship of the land. This is a political and legal extension of the creation doctrine. That is ... native peoples have the creator-given charge to maintain certain respon- sibilities toward land, heritage, and lifeways. Furthermore, this is a basis for the inherited rights to the lands. All this amounts to law whose authority is none other than the creator of the world. No other authority can supersede this, not even that of the President of the United States (p. 65). The discourse involved references to "Mother Earth" by members of various tribes, each of which had its own distinct stories, beliefs, and pantheon. Many Euroamericans have thought these references indicate a pan-Indian religion centered on an Earth Goddess, but Gill disagrees. These references to the earth are metaphorical, not theological 162 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2)</page><page sequence="13">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE [they do not make the earth an immortal personification]. The Native Americans [sought] in the metaphor of motherhood some commonality with their oppressors by which to communicate effectively their reluctance to be severed from their lands. They say simply that their traditions, cultures, heritages, and very existence depend on their land as a child depends on its mother (p. 66). By the mid-twentieth century, however, Gill thinks that "these [Euroamerican] misinterpretations [mistaking metaphorical portrayal of the earth as a mother for a pan-Indian deity] were appropriated by Native Americans who transformed metaphor into divinity" (p. 66)-Mother Earth has become a divinity in a modern, emerging, pan-Indian religion. Accord- ing to Gill, Indians have constructed "an Indian tradition out of a huge variety of tribal traditions, and in turn, [there is] the reflection of aspects of this common tradition in the respective tribal traditions" (p. 150). Gill sees this recent construction as an aspect of "[n]ativism [which] indicates the rejection of the oppressing culture and the assertion of native or indigenous values and ways in response to the experience of cultural deprivation" (p. 138). Much political discourse between Indians and Euroamericans empha- sizes "the differences between cultures ... [and] the superiority of Indian culture over white European-American culture," especially since the latter has degraded the environment so much as to jeopardize life on the earth. We aren't so sure that a lot of Indians who refer to "Mother Earth" in their public statements even today see the earth as a divinity. Many may still use the phrase as a metaphor (and a veil) for their own particular tribal beliefs. Others, especially those with much formal education, may have trouble believing literally in any kind of earth-inhabiting deities, including the immortals of their own tribal beliefs. They may think of Mother Earth and the other immortals as metaphors for an all-pervading power. Such people may not have adopted the Euroamerican construction, as Gill suggests, so much as shared with Euroamericans the difficulty of squaring a secularized formal education that emphasizes scientific routes to knowledge with a literal belief in anthropomorphic immortal beings immanent in the land. Figurative language is the way out-its ambiguity allows one to keep two seemingly contradictory frames of reference. Gill quotes Navajo Tribal Chairman (now Navajo Nation President) Peterson Zah (p. 144) and Asdzaan Bazhnoodaa'i (Woman for Whom They Held an Enemy Way Ceremony) of Black Mesa, both of whom criticize strip mining by asking rhetorically how Navajos can allow their "Mother" to be so damaged (pp. 143, 144). We suggest that these statements, like that of Mamie Salt at the beginning of this paper, continue the "Mother Earth" imagery of the nineteenth century, and for the same reasons-to get their bonds with the land across to non-Navajos by using imagery more accessible to non-Navajos than mentioning Navajo immortals would be (and also probably because there is a widespread reticence to invoke the immortals in non-Navajo contexts). There is also, in statements like that of Mamie Salt, AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VoL 17(2) 163</page><page sequence="14">KELLEY AND FRANCIS the idea of an apocalyptic catastrophe, cultural annihilation, in store for Navajos who give up their responsibility for the land. These are the ideas behind the statement we and other researchers have heard so often, "the whole land is sacred." IMPLICATIONS FOR "HISTORIC PRESERVATION" DECISION MAKING Our own study of thirteen chapters and the various other studies reveal a tension between the historic-preservation bureaucrats' need to set "management priorities" on the one hand, and, on the other, the Navajo cultural aversion to hierarchies, especially in connection with Navajo customs. In the other studies, the researchers reveal a sense of being caught between the go-ahead interests of developers that shape the realpolitik of historic preservation decision making, on the one hand, and on the other, their professional responsibility to convey the concerns of the people they consulted. They compromise by focusing on places-not on whole landscapes, as the people want, but not on nothing, either, as many developers wish. This focus on isolated "historic properties" lets preservation decisionmakers recommend the relatively easy protection measure of resituating the development to avoid these places. That's one reason that they want to know where the boundaries of such places are (documentation for compli- ance with the National Historic Preservation Act also requires such bound- aries). Establishing different ranks of significance gives them a loophole to justify the disturbance or destruction of some places. It should be clear by now that these piecemeal approaches focused on "preserving" isolated places with "cultural significance" to Navajos from the inroads of economic development are at odds with the Navajo approach to preservation. The goal of the Navajo approach is to keep entire, interacting cultural landscapes intact by keeping economic development from disrupt- ing the full range of customary activities that keep these landscapes alive. The preservation decision maker's goal in Navajoland therefore should not be to rank isolated places according to their "level of significance" and then to single out the high-ranking places for protection efforts such as setting boundaries within which development is forbidden. Instead, the goal should be to find out how each place functions in the physical, social, and conceptual landscape of which it is a part, and how can a proposed development be integrated into these landscapes, among these interrelated places, with the least disruption to the lives of the people (including the immortals) whose activities tie them together. An obvious way to practice this "landscape" approach is through meetings between project planners and overseers (including preservation bureaucrats), on the one hand, and, on the other, representatives of the interested communities. Such meetings may then lead to more detailed information gathering about the various parts of the landscape, including particular places, through private interviews. But such place-focused, individual interviews don't occur until the larger landscape context has been 164 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VOL 17(2)</page><page sequence="15">PLACES IMPORTANT TO NAVAJO PEOPLE established. The landscape approach basically asks that cultural landscape preservation be integrated more thoroughly into overall planning, a political process that ordinarily fails to realize cultural landscape planning because it doesn't involve individuals whom the plan will affect. Seemingly among the critics of something like the landscape approach are Richard Stoffle and his colleagues (Stoffle and others 1990; Stoffle and Evans 1990), who call the approach holistic and its advocates self- defeating in the light of all the evidence that the approach is politically unworkable. Their conception of the holistic approach isn't entirely like our landscape approach, however. They sometimes suggest that holism, based on the idea that "the whole land is sacred," implies opposition to all land- disturbing development. But this isn't quite the lesson that we get from the Navajos we have talked with, even those who say "the whole land is sacred." They say, for example, that if you don't use the livestock forage and medicinal plants that the immortals put out for you, the plants will disappear. This statement may seem backward from the omniscient viewpoint claimed by "Western Science."7 Its truth depends on the magnitude of disturbance and of time and space. Older Navajos have seen land once well vegetated where farming in small drainages checked erosion and maintained commensal plants become gullied and bare after people quit farming to buy food at the store. The land undisturbed by humans won't necessarily support humans as well as land that people tend, at least in certain ways. Developments that don't disrupt these relations, especially those that help the land sustain the people and their customs (windmills, for example) without depleting the land, are fine. Everyone realizes that the land can no longer support most Navajos with the old ways of herding and farming, and most people must work for large-scale productive enterprises or in govern- ment jobs. Less acceptable are those developments that deplete the land, do nothing for the people or disrupt their lives, displace them, exploit workers and run away with the profits. Of course, not everyone will evaluate a given project the same way (for example, electric line extensions to people's houses that bring power generated with coal mined on Navajoland). At any rate, Stoffle and his colleagues have refined an approach to preservation decision making that they call "triage." It resembles the piecemeal approach in its focus on places without explicit reference to their relation to the landscape. In practical terms, the triage approach requires the bureaucrat (usually through a researcher) to ask concerned community members to pick which places are most important to preserve and which can be sacrificed to development if necessary. Unlike most practitioners of the piecemeal approach, however, Stoffle and his associates have often worked with community members in groups early in the planning process, as we advocate for our landscape approach. In fact, we believe that the contrast between our landscape approach and the triage of Stoffle and colleagues is more apparent than real. Community representatives talking with researchers in the framework of triage may actually base their decisions on an unspoken (at least to the AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SPRING 1993/VOL 17(2) 165</page><page sequence="16">KELLEY AND FRANCIS researchers) analysis of how the project can best fit into the landscape with the least damage to its interconnectedness. The landscape approach simply makes this framework explicit. This explication is important because it can lead to better understanding between community people and planners. NOTES This paper includes a small part of the text of A Story Goes With It: Navajo Sacred Places and the Encounter with Economic Development, by Klara Kelley and Harris Francis, to be published by Indiana University Press. 1. The Navajo Nation Historic Preservation and Archaeology Departments matched grants from the Arizona and New Mexico State Historic Preservation Offices to fund this work. 2. Besides the authors, interviewers were Richard Begay, Alexa Roberts, Stella Clyde, and Loretta Werito. 3. To avoid the "us and them," literate-nonliterate value judgment implicit in the common usages of the words "history" and "story," we follow Gill's (1987:67-68) usage of the word "story:" "When the facts of history come together for someone in a way that reveals their meaning . .. a story is born.. .. For the European-American story tradition the authority is history, even though the story is not strictly historical; for the Native American story tradition the authority is religious and outside of history, even though the story reflects history." 4. These sources also cover Navajo archaeology and the story of Navajos under colonial rule and include: Van Valkenburgh 1941, 1974; Watson 1964; Wyman 1962, 1973; Luckert 1975, 1977, 1978; Navajo Nation n.d.a, n.d.b, 1962; Stokes and Smiley 1963, 1964, 1966, 1969; Crampton 1959; Hafen and Hafen 1954; McNitt 1962, 1972; Kelley 1977; Richardson 1985; Colton 1946; Gregory 1916; Walker and Shepherd 1964; Threinen 1981; Bingham and Bingham 1979; Fransted 1979; Fransted and Werner n.d.; York 1979, 1984; York and Winter 1988; Etcitty n.d.; Brugge 1964; Carroll 1982, 1983; Condie and Knudson, eds., 1982; Kemrer and Lord 1984, Begay and others 1992; and Vannette 1988. 5. These studies include: Van Valkenburgh 1974; Fransted 1979; York 1979, 1984; York and Winter 1988; Bartlett 1980; Bowen and others 1991; Cahn 1982; Carroll 1982, 1983; Cleeland and Doyel 1982; Clinton 1990; Condie and others 1982; Francis 1988; Francis and Kelley 1993; Jett, Neboyia and Morgan n.d.; Kelley and Francis 1991; Kemrer and Lord 1984; Vannette and Feary 1981; Walt and others 1987; Wood and Vannette 1979; Vannette 1988. 6. Another link between the Anasazis and the Navajos is that Navajo stories of the origins of many Navajo clans attribute their ancestry to the occupants of particular Anasazi archaeological sites or to various Pueblo Indian groups (see, for example, Matthews [1897] and Mitchell [1978]), who in turn identify the Anasazis, or at least the occupants of particular Anasazi archaeological sites, as their forebears. 7. The "Western Scientific" way of knowing, incidentally, from a "holistic" viewpoint like Navajo seems paradoxical in its reliance on analytical disarticulation, after which its all-too-human practitioners forget to reassemble things (at least analytically) and see if they still work together in the real world as they seemed to in experimental isolation.
