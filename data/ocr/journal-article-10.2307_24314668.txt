<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES Vol. 23 September, 1960 No. 3 THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES Wilfred T. Neill Research Division, Ross Allen's Reptile Institute, Inc. Silver Springs, Florida During recent studies on the herpetofauna of British Hon duras, I noted certain juvenile pit vipers with bright yellow tails. The occurrence of a yellow tail in various young snakes is of broad zoological interest, for in some cases the brightly colored append age is said to function as a lure, attracting lizards and frogs to within the snake's striking range. Previous reviews of this phenom enon have been incomplete, the literature has not been satisfactorily collated, and several aspects of the topic merit further discussion. The Caudal Lure in the Pit Vipers The account may begin with the pit vipers (family Viperidae, subfamily Crotalinae). Ditmars (1907) was the first to describe the caudal lure. He noted that young of the copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) had bright sulfur-yellow tails. When living food was introduced into their cage, the young snakes would wriggle their tails in a manner remarkably suggestive of writhing grubs or maggots. Among dry leaves, the reptiles' skin patterns blended so well with the sur roundings that, from a short distance away, only the writhing tails could be seen. Ditmars thought it probable that frogs would be deceived by the lure. These observations appeared in other writ ings of Ditmars (e. g., 1922, 1936). Henry (1925) described apparently successful luring by a white tailed juvenile of an Asiatic moccasin (Agkistrodon hypnale). When lizards were placed in the cage, the snake began waving its caudal appendage. A lizard was eventually caught and eaten. Pvcraft (1925) stated that this tail wriggling was carried on by the</page><page sequence="2">174 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES light-tailed young of the copperhead, of the cottonmouth (A. pisciv orus), and of the fer-de-lance (Bothrops atrox). He noted that the brightly colored tail of the young snake would begin to writhe when frogs were placed in the cage, and that the snake itself was well camouflaged while luring. Cott (1940), following Pycraft, remarked on the yellow tail tip of the young copperhead, cotton mouth, and fer-de-lance; he accepted the interpretation that the structure served as a lure. Kauffeld (1943) raised broods of the banded rock rattlesnake (Crotalus lepidus klauberi) and of the twin-spotted rattlesnake (C. p. pricei). The young rock rattlers had sulfur-yellow tails; the twin-spotted rattlers did not. The rock rattlers often lay coiled, excellently camouflaged, and motionless except for the tail; this appendage was wriggled in a fashion exceedingly reminiscent of an insect larva. The twin-spotted rattlers, with dark tails, exhib ited no such behavior. Kauffeld felt that in nature the tail of the young rock rattler might well lure a lizard, but he could not defi nitely associate tail-waving with hunger or with feeding behavior in captivity. He also questioned Henry's (loc. cit.) observations. This same year, M. A. Smith (1943) mentioned impressively suc cessful luring of lizards by Henry's examples of Agkistrodon hyp nale. Next, I described luring behavior in a brood of southern cop perheads (Agkistrodon c. contortrix) from near Augusta, Richmond County, Georgia (Neill, 1948). The behavior was evoked from the snakes by the presence of cricket frogs (Acris g. grylitis). Sub sequently I observed the phenomenon in another copperhead brood from the same area. On the basis of these additional obser vations I should like to emphasize certain points of the earlier discussion. 1. Tail-waving was not carried on in the dark. This might have been expected, for the similarity of the "bait" to a worm or insect larva involves optical properties: shape and movement, as well as the pallid, unmarked coloration. Such a close similarity in optical properties, of the snake's tail to a larva, might at first seem unnecessary; but it has been shown that frogs are capable of distinguishing between various classes of potential prey (Cott, loc. cit.), and the same is true of lizards (idem). 2. Tail-waving was not carried on in strong light. This, too,</page><page sequence="3">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 175 might have been anticipated. In bright surroundings the outlines of the snake proper are apt to be clearly distinguishable; the efficacy of the lure is reduced, and the possibility of exposure to ophiophagous predators is increased. Also, in the habitat of the copperhead there are few frogs that forage in bright sunlight although some lizards may do so. It is difficult to say, in the absence of direct measurement, just what degree of illumination inhibited the luring behavior. The human optical system, very adaptable, does not register the fact that the light intensity in a room with ordinary artificial illum ination may be several thousand times less than in the out-of-doors. The two Augusta broods were kept in a box open to light only at the top. When the box was placed, during daylight hours, on the floor and in a corner of a room with windows, the snakes would usually begin tail-waving as soon as frogs were offered. Luring was rarely attempted in direct artificial light, which might actually have been insufficient rather than too bright; nor was it attempted when the box was placed near a window through which strong natural light fell. I would estimate that a degree of illumination, suitable for luring, obtains in nature for several hours during morning and evening in the honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) tangles, kudzu (Pueraria thunbergiana) thickets, and brushy stream margins that make up the usual habitat of the copperhead in the Augusta area. In general, luring was attempted when the illumination was such as to permit the yellow tail to stand out clearly, yet to ob scure the outlines of the snake proper. 3. Tail-waving was not carried on unless the snakes were on a concealing background. This is similarly consistent with the theory of luring. 4. Tail-waving was not carried on unless frogs were present and hopping about. (I did not experiment with lizards.) In nature such behavior would go far toward assuring that the lure would be seen by prey and not by some animal capable of making off with the whole snake. Kauffeld (loc. cit.) noted that his rock rattlers waved the tail not only in the presence of lizards but also "when no lizard was in sight, or when [the writhing tail] could not have been seen by the lizard." These observations are not inconsistent with mine,</page><page sequence="4">176 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES even though at first they might appear to be. In interpreting rep tile behavior, one must carefully avoid anthropomorphism, and must also think of such behavior in terms of virtually automatic responses to stimuli. In the luring behavior, the stimulus (aware ness of the nearby presence of suitable prey) evokes from the snake an overt response (tail-waving). The awareness need not be a matter of vision. Rattlesnakes have, for example, a keen sense of smell, and can distinguish among various odors (Cowles and Phelan, 1958). Also, by means of the pit organ which is an infra red receptor, they can distinguish objects that are either warmer or colder than the background (Noble and Schmidt, 1937; Bullock and Cowles, 1952). It is possible that Kauffeld's rattlers were from time to time receiving an olfactory stimulus that triggered the luring behavior. My copperheads waved the tail only when frogs were hopping about; when the amphibians settled to rest, the raised tails were lowered. In this case the stimulus was either visual or else involved infrared reception, perhaps both. How ever, I suspect that young copperheads might also respond to an olfactory stimulus, in a cage that was impregnated with the odor of some potential prey. It is also possible that an internal stimu lus, hunger, combines with external ones to bring about luring behavior. Returning to the literature, in 1948 my colleague, Ross Allen, observed successful luring by young of the cantil or Mexican moc casin (Agkistrodon bilineatus). He made a series of photographs clearly showing that toads, treefrogs, and lizards were attracted to the waving yellow tails. These photographs accompanied his article, but only one was selected for publication (Allen, 1949). Some others of the series were used by Atz (1950) in a popular account of luring. As the most revealing of Allen's photographs have never appeared in any technical journal, I include some of them here (Fig. 1, a-d). They should set at rest any remaining doubt concerning the efficacy of the caudal lure. In Fig. 1, a, an anole (Anolis c. carolinensis) has observed the lure. In Fig. 1, b, the lizard has moved into the snake's striking range, and has reared to seize the lure. In Fig. 1, c, an oak toad (Bufo quercicus) manifests interest in the lure. In Fig. 1, d, the toad has hopped onto the coiled snake in an effort to reach the lure. Allen found that the cantil could readily lure green tree</page><page sequence="5">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 177 Fig. 1.

For further description see text.</page><page sequence="6">178 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES frogs (Hyla cinerea), squirrel treefrogs (Ii. squirella), anoles, and oak toads, but would strike and eat only the first three of these species. Of course, toads, somewhat protected by glandular se cretions, are refused by many snakes that accept other anurans. The cantils, like the copperheads, did not use the lure in the dark. Allen's unpublished notes reveal that they were also re luctant to wave the tail in bright light. He found it difficult to illuminate the snakes sufficiently to permit the making of photo graphs, without also inhibiting tail-waving. Allen's article pointed out that the resemblance of the snake's yellow tail tip to an invertebrate was enhanced by a gray terminal spot, suggestive of a caterpillar's head. (In the southern copper head, a comparable marking closely simulates paired eye-spots, and behind these are minute transverse dark lines resembling segmentation or wrinkling.) Popular accounts of luring by Agkistrodon bilineatus and A. hypnale were presented by Blaedel (1953, 1954, 1955). Burger and Smith (1950) introduced a complication. They found that, among three broods of the fer-de-lance, only the males were provided with yellow tail tips. In the females, the tip of the tail was but slightly lighter than the remainder of the append age, with dorsal blotches extending virtually throughout. Burger and Smith's snakes sometimes held up the tail but did not wave it or use it to lure prey. The sexually dimorphic broods were from Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia. Ditmars (1937) figured a yellow-tailed example from Honduras, and a brood of young from a Honduran parent. In this latter photograph, most of the snakes are coiled in such a fashion as to conceal the tail; but in at least some of the figured individuals, this appendage is not immaculate yellow but is marked as in Burger and Smith's females. (A somewhat sharper print of Ditmars' figure appeared in Pope, 1944.) It may be presumed that the fer-de-lance exhibits a dimorphism of tail color in Hon duras, as in countries to the north and south thereof. A yellow tailed Costa Rican example is identified as a male (Taylor, 1954). Also, I have examined newborn fer-de-lance from British Hon duras, in the collection of Ross Allen and myself, finding that, as reported by Burger and Smith, a yellow tail characterizes the juve nile male only.</page><page sequence="7">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 179 It may be significant that records of this sexual dimorphism in the fer-de-lance all relate to broods of the population called Both rops atrox asper, a name revived by Smith and Taylor (1945). The subspecies is presumed to range from Mexico through Cen tral America into Colombia and perhaps somewhat beyond. The subspecific splitting has been disavowed by Amaral (1954); but whether taxonomically distinct or not, the population is a north erly offshoot of an essentially South American stock. The more southerly B. atrox may well be yellow-tailed in both sexes. Cer tainly some large Neotropical lanceheads, closely related to B. atrox, exhibit the bright yellow tail tip in male and female. Fig. 2, a, portrays one individual of a litter of Bothrops born at the Rep tile Institute. The young are as large as those of B. atrox, and, while presently unidentified, represent one of the near allies of that species. Both sexes are yellow-tailed. Burger and Smith thought it possible that the fer-de-lance might be losing the yellow tail tip because as a juvenile it feeds to a considerable extent upon prey that is not attracted by a worm like lure. Their specimens, while accepting frogs, also ate other snakes, which probably could not be lured. It might be added that a yellow tail tip is very conspicuous and could well attract an occasional visually oriented ophiophage. Loss of the juvenile yellow tail color, in a species or population, may therefore reflect not only the nature of the snake's available prey but also the nature of the local ophiophages. There is one report of geographic variation in the tail color of a juvenile lancehead, in this case involving both sexes. H. M. Smith (1943) stated that in a more northerly Mexican population of the jumping viper, the tail tip of the young was never yellow, whereas in a more southerly one it was always yellow. Smith thought he was dealing with two species, but both are now con sidered Bothrops nummifer (Neill and Allen, 1960). British Hon duras juveniles, examined by me, combine the characters of the two nominal forms, but are always yellow-tailed in both sexes. (Burger and Smith were puzzled by a report that the young jump ing viper ate crickets and grasshoppers, which of course are not lured. However, these food items were almost surely secondarily ingested. A frog, lizard, or salamander, packed with insects, is eaten by a snake; the lizard or amphibian is digested but its stomach</page><page sequence="8">180 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES C V Fig. 2.

The contrast between the yellowish-tan body and the sulfur yellow tail is greater in the living specimen than the photograph would suggest.</page><page sequence="9">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 181 contents are not (Neill and Allen, 1956). The indigestible, chitin ous insect fragments remain in the snake's digestive tract long after the primarily ingested prey has vanished.) Although this geographic variation in juvenile tail color is theoretically explicable in the light of varying selective factors, it is difficult to see why in the fer-de-lance, or a population thereof, the bright tail should have been lost in females yet remain fairly well developed in males. Of course, the reproductive organs of the male snake are carried in the tail rather than the body. In the male the caudal appendage is usually longer and stouter at the base than in the female, for it must contain the large hemi penes, their specialized muscles, and vascularization. The tail of the male must undergo different embryonic development, and be under somewhat different genetic control. Also, the caudal appendage of the male, being longer, is better adapted for modi fication into a lure, and in most if not all of the tail-waving species, the yellow tail tip is somewhat more conspicuous in the male. Returning again to the literature, Hylander (1951) described the use of the caudal lure by the copperhead, but the account was obtained from me and did not involve any new observations. Klauber (1956) summarized the observations of Kauffeld (loc. cit.), Allen (loc. cit.), and Smith and Burger (loc. cit.). Wright and Wright (1957), citing only Neill (loc. cit.) and Smith and Burger, stated that the use of the yellow tail tip as a lure was "not wholly confirmed." About the same time, Schmidt and Inger (1957) stated that the yellow tail tip of the cottonmouth, like that of the copper head, was believed to function as a lure. Finally, Wharton (1960) observed use of the caudal lure by young cottonmouths from Florida, providing a sketch of the luring posture and of the positions assumed by the writhing tails. As the lure of the cottonmouth has not been figured photographically, I provide an illustration (Fig. 2, b). Wharton's snakes did not wave the tail during the night even under artificial illumination. Apparently, luring behavior was evoked from the reptiles by the presence of toads in the cage. However, the toads seemingly were not attracted to the lure, and were not eaten. It may be mentioned that cottonmouths of all ages refuse toads, within my experience. (It will be recalled that Allen's cantils</page><page sequence="10">182 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES similarly ignored toads even though these anurans were attracted to the lure.) No doubt, to observe under captive conditions the entire process of luring, the experimenter will find it necessary to provide food animals that are acceptable to the snake, that feed upon worms or larvae comparable in size and appearance to the reptile's yellow tail tip, and that find food visually. It should also be borne in mind that frogs or lizards, suddenly placed in the snake's cage, may not adjust to captivity therein for days or weeks, per haps never. Vivarium keepers well know that some amphibians and reptiles refuse all food in captivity, and eventually starve. To recapitulate briefly, successful use of the caudal lure has been observed and thoroughly documented in the Mexican Agkis trodon bilineatus. The United States species, A. contortrix and A. piscivorus, are provided with exactly the same sort of lure as A. bilineatus, and they employ it in precisely the same fashion when potential prey is introduced. The frogs and lizards, de ceived by the caudal lure of A. bilineatus, were of species that in nature are associated with A. contortrix and A. piscivorus. It should no longer be questioned that in all three New World moc casins the yellow tail tip of the juvenile functions as a lure. In view of observations on these moccasins, and the Old World A. hypnale, I would have no hesitancy in granting that Kaulfeld's (loc. cit.) rock rattlers were also carrying on luring behavior. It is not surprising that prey is not always successfully lured under the abnormal conditions of captivity. The Yellow Tail Tip in Certain Juvenile Pit Vipers Luring, a distinctive behavior pattern involving manipulation of the yellow tail tip, has thus been reported in juveniles of Agkis trodon contortrix, A. piscivorus, A. bilineatus, A. hypnale, Bothrops atrox, and Crotalus lepidus klauberi. In all of these it is definitely known that the yellow color of the tail tip is lost with age. In the rattler the tail becomes salmon, remaining in contrast with the body; in all the others it darkens and assumes the general body col oration. In the copperhead and cottonmouth, at least, some trace of the bright tail color may persist (as a greenish-yellow tinge) into the second year of life, or even beyond. This was noted for the broad-banded copperhead (A. c. laticinctus) by Ditmars (1907) in the first published account of luring.</page><page sequence="11">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE NSAKES 183 Among snakes there are often various changes of color from the juvenile to the adult, and these ontogenetic changes are a func tion of time rather than of growth. That is to say, a young snake that is feeding heavily will grow rapidly, and so will exhibit the juvenile coloration at a fairly large size; whereas a young snake that is on a minimum diet will grow very slowly, and will still be rather small when the ontogenetic color change is complete. There fore the yellow tail tip, like other juvenile color characters, is not always lost at the same body length within each species. Ontogenetic loss of the yellow tail color was reported for the copperhead well before luring had ever been observed (e. g., Stejneger, 1895). However, many other pit vipers, described in the early literature as being yellow-tailed, white-tailed, or red tailed, remain practically unknown even today, and in some of these cases nothing is known of the brightly colored appendage beyond the mere fact of its existence. But when the various ref erences are collated, it appears likely that quite a few of these snakes are provided with a typical caudal lure as in Agkistrodon bilineatiis. A brief review of the literature, and of available speci mens, is warranted. In the Japanese Agkistrodon halys blomhoffi, the tail tip of the young is always "light colored" (Stejneger, 1907). I find that it is dark in adults, of both the reddish and the blackish color phases. In the more northerly (Tamaulipan) race of the cantil (.Agkistrodon bilineatus taylori), the tail tip was "yellow-green," in a young example (Burger and Robertson, 1951). The tail tip is "bright yellow" in the young of the southern Pa cific rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis hellen), but becomes gray or black with age (Klauber, loc. cit.). In newborn young of the canebrake rattlesnake (C. horridus atricaudatus) the dorsal surface of the tail is gray with darker transverse bands, but the lateral and ventral sur faces of the appendage are tinged with sulfur-yellow (personal ob servation in the Upper Coastal Plain of eastern Georgia and nearby South Carolina). As the tail of the male is longer than that of the female, the former sex is more definitely yellow-tailed. In this spe cies, with which I am especially familiar, the young probably do not practice luring; but the yellow tinge of the tail, so like that of the juvenile moccasin, is apt to be a vestigial character. A yellow tail tip is also suggested in the South American rattlesnake (C. durissus</page><page sequence="12">184 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES terrificus), and will probably be found, at least in vestigial form, among several other rattlers when neonatal examples become avail able for study. In the pygmy rattlesnake (Sistrurus miliarius) the young are born with "bright-yellow" tails (Klauber, loc. cit.). I find that, in a small living example of the Floridian subspecies (S. m. barbouri), with two rattle segments and a button, the scales of the distal por tion of the tail are edged with deep chrome yellow and are mostly centered with red, so that the gross appearance is close to a cad mium orange. The red involves the rattle matrix and the first rattle segment. The color is different from the sulfur-yellow or greenish-yellow of Agkistrodon contortrix. As the yellow-tailed juvenile of the pygmy rattler has not been illustrated, I provide a photograph of an individual collected at Silver Springs, Marion County, Florida (Fig. 2, c). It is not the specimen described, but a smaller and younger one. Among the New World lancehead snakes, a Panamanian species (Bothrops leptura) was described as new on the basis of its long, thin, "yellow and unspotted" tail (Amaral, 1923). An Ecuadorian lancehead (B. alticola) has the distal portion of the tail "white (red in life?)" according to Parker (1934). I find that in a half-grown specimen of the Peruvian B. oligolepis, the distal portion of the tail shows orange-brown spots with whitish interspaces, while the remainder of the tail, like the body, is marked with black and greenish-yellow. Almost surely the caudal pattern is character istic of an ontogenetic stage between a yellow-tailed juvenile and a dark-tailed adult. The copperhead, cottonmouth, cantil, and fer de-lance go through a similar stage, during which the dorsal pat tern begins to appear, in pallid version, on the tail. The tail is red in Bothrops schlegeli, according to Schmidt and Inger (loc. cit.), while in another species, unnamed by them, it is lemon yellow. Taylor (loc. cit.) described and figured examples of Costa Rican B. schlegeli, one with "orange" on the tail tip but others with the tail spotted like the body and not distinctively marked. In Asia are also found various lancehead snakes. Two Old World species seem especially close to the arboreal lanceheads of the New World (Maslin, 1942); and at least one of these (Trimere sums wagleri) has a tail that is "usually red or reddish-brown"</page><page sequence="13">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 185 (Boulenger, 1912). This must be true only of the young, for in the adult the tail is blackish with green speckles (Schmidt and Inger, loc. cit.). In Malaya the end of the tail of Trimeresurus gramineus is red or yellow (Boulenger, loc. cit.); "pale reddish" in China (Pope and Pope, 1933). T. erythrurus, thought by Stejneger (1907) to be merely a red-tailed or yellow-tailed "phase" of T. gramineus, was considered by Pope and Pope to be a distinct species; they de scribed a specimen in which the tail tip was greenish-brown with dark brown bands. De Rooij (1917) mentioned the "red" tail tip of T. sumatranus; the "yellow or red" one of T. gramineus; the reddish one of T. puniceus; and the "reddish or reddish-brown" one of T. wagleri. The tail tip is red or reddish in Malayan T. sumatranus and T. borneensis (Boulenger, loc. cit.); pale reddish in Chinese T. stejnegeri and T. albolabris (Pope, 1935). Taylor and Elbel (1958) mentioned individuals of Siamese T. albolabris with brown-spotted tails and others with "uniformly colored" or "grayish, not brown spotted" tails. It was not stated whether the apparent dimorphism was correlated with sex or size. Günther (1864) described an Indian species (T. strigatus) in which the tail of the young, but not of the adult, was "white." The end of the tail was "uniform light brown" in an example of T. popeorum from Siam; very light, to judge from the illustration (Taylor and Elbel, loc. cit.). According to Stejneger (1907), the tail tip was "uniform light-colored (yellow?)" in the young but not the adult of T. ele gans from the southern Ryukyu Islands. (In this and other para graphs I have brought up to date the generic nomenclature of earlier authors.) It is thus evident that many pit vipers, not as yet observed to carry on luring, are provided when young with a brightly colored, usually yellow, worm-like tail tip; the bright color vanishes with age, being replaced by the general body pattern. This is pre cisely the condition obtaining in pit vipers known to lure prey. It is probable that in all these crotaline snakes the yellow tail tip of the juvenile is either a caudal lure or a vestigial remnant thereof. Puzzling, however, are references to red-tailed pit vipers. Schmidt and Inger (loc. cit.) stated that many Trimeresurus, in cluding T. puniceus, are red-tailed. They gave no indication of</page><page sequence="14">186 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES believing that this was a juvenile character only, and seemed to feel that the New World Bothrops schlegeli was also persistently red-tailed. Certainly in Crotalus lepidus klauberi the yellow cau dal lure eventually becomes reddish, and remains so. Could a red tail also be used to lure some kind of prey? In several harmless snakes of the family Colubridae, the under side of the tail is red. When the snake is disturbed, the append age is curled in such a way as to display the bright under side (Davis, 1948; Mertens, 1946; Neill, 1951). In the large but harm less South American cribo (Drymarchon c. corais) the tail and posterior part of the body are deep yellow while the remainder of the snake is black. When approached, the reptile raises the bright tail in the air and waves it about (personal observation). However, the red tail of various pit vipers is not apt to be compar ably aposematic, for it is not displayed upon disturbance. The Crotalus, like others of its genus, generally rests with the rattle elevated, so that the tail is of necessity conspicuous; but the red tailed lanceheads, of the both the Old World and the New, are arboreal, and the appendage is usually coiled for support around a twig or branch. In such a position it is not especially in evi dence. In many snakes of the family Elapidae, subfamily Elapinae, the tail is brightly colored at least on the under side. When the snake is disturbed, the appendage is curled into a head-like ball and elevated, while the actual head is kept low (Mertens, 1946; Neill, 1951; Schmidt and Inger, loc. cit.). Presumably predators are deceived into directing their attack toward the wrong end of the snake. However, this is not apt to be the function of the red tail in pit vipers, which usually do not raise the caudal appendage or lower the head when a predator appears. Yet almost surely the red tail color will be found to serve some function. Most references to white, gray, ivory, light brown, or pale red tails of young pit vipers are probably based on preserved examples from which the red or yellow pigments have been partly or wholly dissolved. A green or greenish-yellow tail probably results from a com bination of the usual yellow pigment with a Tyndall blue, the latter resulting from melanin deposits beneath pellucid tissues.</page><page sequence="15">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 187 Thus, in spite of literature references to various tail colors among juvenile pit vipers, only two or at the most three pigments seem to be involved. In at least a majority of the species men tioned herein, the pigment of the juvenile tail tip is essentially a yellow, varying interspecifically in intensity, and evanescent in preservatives. A red may also be present from birth, as in Sistrurus miliarius, or may develop later as in Crotalus lepidus. As this red is not so fleeting in preservatives, it may be one of the reddish melanins. A darker melanin may, through a Tyndall effect, give the yellow a greenish cast, and may eventually replace the yellow caudally. The scattered literature references, when analyzed, reveal that the caudal lure, or some indication thereof, is widespread among pit vipers. I did not learn the appearance of the tail in hatchlings of the bushmaster (Lachesis muta); or in the young of the so-called "hog-nosed vipers," a group of small lanceheads ranging from Mexico to South America and probably meriting generic separa tion from Bothrops. With these possible exceptions, yellow-tailed juveniles occur in every presently recognized genus of the family Viperidae, subfamily Crotalinae. Evidently the yellow tail tip is an ancient character, antedating the generic separation and dis persal of the pit vipers. It should therefore be looked for in other families of snakes. The Yellow Tail Tip in Other Snake Families Closest relatives of the pit vipers are the true vipers (family Viperidae, subfamily Viperinae). There seems to be no reference to a viperine snake that is yellow-tailed as a juvenile. In the Egyptian Cerastes vipera, there is sexual dimorphism in tail color, but it characterizes adults as well as juveniles. According to Marx (1958), in most males the tail is colored like the body (pallid, sandy) and has a black terminal spot; in most females the entire append age is black. Schnurrenberger (1959), who examined living speci mens, pointed out that in the male the tail is actually lighter than the body. The original description of a Liberian viper, Atractaspis corpulentum, made no mention of a light tail, but subsequent au thors have noted specimens in which the tail was "entirely white" or "partially . . . white or cream;" see Taylor and Weyer (1958).</page><page sequence="16">188 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES Snakes of the family Elapidae mostly lack a caudal lure. This situation would be expected among the marine snakes of the elapid subfamily Hydrophiinae, in which the tail is oar-like. Of the sub family Elapinae, the death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) of the Australian region is unique in having the build and certain habits of a viper. According to De Rooij (loc. cit.), its tail may be either yellow-tipped or all black; an accompanying pen-and-ink illustra tion of a young example seems to show a caudal lure much as in, say, Agkistrodon piscivorus. In the death adder the tail is of nearly uniform diameter throughout, very slender in contrast with the heavy body. The terminal scute of the tail is modified into a curved spine, and the entire appendage resembles a scorpion's sting. The resemblance is impressively close, and in Australia it is popularly but erroneously believed that the snake conveys its venom by means of a caudal "sting." The reptile has the habit of lying coiled and camouflaged in small, open spots along trails through patches of jungle, and at the edges of clearings in densely wooded areas (personal observation in the Markham Valley area of New Guinea). It is unlikely that the modification of this snake's tail is a case of protective resemblance. The outlines and behavior of the snake are probably more discouraging to predators than the appearance of a scorpion's sting. It would not be surprising to find that the young death adder lures some scorpion-eating prey. Many organisms eat scorpions, and a few are even known to direct their attack at the arachnid's uplifted sting. The harmless and rear-fanged snakes (family Colubridae), for all their diversity, apparently are not provided with the caudal lure. In the rainbow snake (Abastor erythrogrammus) of the south eastern United States, the hatchling females have larger and darker spots on the under side of the tail than do the males (Richmond, 1954), but no reason for the dimorphism has been suggested. A caudal lure would not be expected among the secretive blind snakes (families Typhlopidae and Leptotyphlopidae). Many of these are scarcely larger than worms themselves, and feed on ants or termites. The tail is very short and blunt, resembling the head. In some species both head and tail are bright yellow, in contrast with the dark body; presumably the condition is con fusing to some predators. In the families Xenopeltidae, Uropelti dae, and Aniliidae, there is no indication of the caudal lure, al</page><page sequence="17">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 189 though in all these groups there are interesting modifications of the tail, as regards structure and/or use. In the boa and python family, the Boidae, the yellow tail makes its appearance again. Barbour (1937) may have been the first to note the similarity in tail color between young moccasins and cer tain young boas. He found that the end of the tail was "bright yellow" in a brood of Trachyboa boulengeri, a dwarf boa from Panama. He noted that a similar condition obtained in the dwarf boas of the genus Tropidophis. Although not mentioning the possibility that the appendange might serve as a lure, Barbour did offer the interesting comment that a yellow tail tip "must be a character as ancient as black temporal stripes, cross bands be tween the eyes, loreal stripes, and other color features which are probably among the most ancient and stable of reptilian charact ers. . . [Perhaps] the agkistrodons sprang from some early ophidian stock having a common ancestry with these little terrestrial boids for the brilliant yellow tails of young moccasins are strikingly similar." The genus Tropidophis, closely related to Trachyboa, is repre sented by about half-a-dozen species in the West Indies, plus two in South America. There are references to a yellow tail tip in the young of Tropidophis maculatus pilsbryi, T. melanurus, and T. nigriventris, all Cuban (Bailey, 1937). Bailey also mentioned a black terminal scute in T. nigriventris. In a young specimen of T. parkeri from Little Cayman Island, the distal part of the tail was "light green with minute black tip" (Grant, 1940b). Grant referred to the brightly colored tail tip of T. parkeri as a "caudal finger" and noted that in an adult female the green was still evi dent through brown speckling. An early account, cited by Stull (1928), considered the blunt, brightly colored tail of young T. par dalis to be "curved for clasping." In T. pardalis stejnegeri of Ja maica, the tail tip was olive above and yellow below; in T. maculatus stulli of this island, the last half of the tail was bright yellow be neath (Grant, 1940a). Hoopes (1938) described ontogenetic change in Cuban T. melanurus; just as in various moccasins, the tail tip was yellow at birth but darkened with age. Stejneger (1917) provided a line drawing of the tail in Cuban T. pardalis, but other wise the yellow tail of the juvenile dwarf boas has not been illus</page><page sequence="18">190 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES trated. I therefore include a photograph of a young T. melanurus (Fig. 2, d). Barbour and Ramsden (1919) thought that Tropidophis melanu rus, in spite of the meaning of its specific name ("black tail"), never developed a black tail. However, Grant (1957) described the ontogenetic change of tail color from greenish to black. Grant, also Schwartz and Thomas (1960), indicated a possibility of sexual dimorphism in the adult tail color of this species, but neither paper made clear the nature of this dimorphism. T. pardalis evidently develops a black tail, and may show some geographic variation in the degree to which the caudal appendage darkens with age (Bailey, loc. cit.; Hecht et al., 1955). Here again, from the litera ture it cannot be determined whether sexual dimorphism is in volved in the adult tail color. Hecht et al. (loc. cit.) noted that yellow-tailed young of Tropi dophis pardalis often held the caudal appendage erect. They thought the bright tail tip might be aposematic. They noted that several of their specimens had part, and in one case all, of the tail missing, and attributed this to the work of visually oriented pred ators, perhaps land crabs. (It should be noted that many snakes frequently are found lacking a part or all of the tail. The North American species of Natrix and Thamnophis are often so muti lated, and the condition in these has been ascribed to turtles. Actually, the condition also is of common occurrence in some very secretive snakes, e. g., Tantilla canula of the Yucatan Peninsula. It is, at least in most cases, not the work of predators but the result of a widespread ophidian disease which for want of a better name I have called tail-rot. The tail becomes dry and bloodless toward the tip, which breaks away. The progress of the disease may soon be halted, or may continue until the entire appendage is lost; but in any event the snake recovers without other harm.) Hecht et al. opposed the idea that the yellow tail tip of Bahaman T. pardalis functioned as a lure, because they considered the snake to be secretive or nocturnal. However, wholly nocturnal snakes are very few, perhaps because insolation is involved with Vitamin D metabolism or with pituitary-governed physiological cycles. So called "nocturnal" snakes usually are also crepuscular, if indeed they do not venture abroad in the early morning hours. Further more, Barbour and Ramsden (loc. cit.) noted that this snake in</page><page sequence="19">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 191 the Bahamas "frequently appears crawling by daylight after heavy thunder showers." Barbour and Ramsden thought the reptiles were driven from their retreats by rainwater flooding, but this is improbable; secretive, non-aquatic snakes usually are confined to habitats where there is no danger of flooding except under un usual weather conditions. It is more likely that T. pardalis, like many other secretive snakes, prowls after rains in order to catch certain prey species that also come forth at such times. Hecht et al. were told by local residents that T. pardalis appeared after rains; and these authors quoted an account of similar habits in the Jamaican T. maculatus jamaicensis. C. B. Lewis (in Grant, 1940b) stated that T. melanurus caymanensis was caught in num bers after the rains on Grand Cayman Island. Hecht et al. noted that examples of Tropidophis pardalis, kept captive by them, accepted small lizards, especially anoles; but suggested that young treefrogs (Hyla septentrionalis) might be a prey in some areas. Stull (loc. cit.) included literature references to prédation upon treefrogs (Hyla pulchrilineata) by the Haitian T. maculatus haetianus; and on treefrogs (II. septentrionalis), a lizard, and birds by the Cuban T. melanurus. (The latter snake is much larger than its congeners, more arboreal, and less secre tive.) Young T. melanurus caymanensis ate frogs (Eleutherodac tylus species) in captivity (Lewis in Grant, 1940b). An anole (Anolis sagrei) was found in an example of T. parkeri from Little Cayman Island (Grant, 1940b). When the literature on Tropidophis is reviewed in toto, there is strong circumstantial evidence that the yellow tail functions as a lure, just as in some Agkistrodon. The tail tip of the young Tropidophis, as in the young moccasins, is either yellow or green ish. In at least some of the Tropidophis, just as in some Agkistro don, the tip of the tail bears a terminal spot of gray or black, en hancing the resemblance of the appendage to some vermiform in vertebrate. The dwarf boas' tails are muscular and prehensile, capable of the rhythmic, wave-like motions through which the lure is put in Agkistrodon. The food of Tropidophis, except per haps in adults of the large, aberrant T. melanurus, consists largely of frogs and lizards, both of which are susceptible to luring. Specific food records for Tropidophis mention frogs of the genus Hyla and lizards of the genus Anolis; both genera are known to be</page><page sequence="20">192 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES susceptible to the caudal lure of Agkistrodon. In the dwarf boas, as in moccasins, the yellow tail of the juvenile is lost with age. The situation in Tropidophis closely parallels that in Agkistrodon, and one might well accept the same explanation for the yellow tail tip of both (and of Trachyboa). When Barbour (loc. cit.) speculated regarding the yellow tail of moccasin and dwarf boa as a common inheritance from some early ophidian stock, he remarked, "I hardly expect that this no tion is worthy of serious consideration." Today the idea, while still unproven, has more to recommend it. Boas are among the earliest of snakes to appear in the fossil record (Bellairs and Un derwood, 1951). Modern boas are, structurally, the most primi tive of snakes (Dowling, 1959). There is "growing evidence" that the viperids were derived from some boa-like stock (Savage, 1957). Boas and vipers, for all their differences, have several features in common. In both families, live-bearing species far outnumber egg-laying ones. In all members of both families, the pupil of the eye is round in dim light but forms a vertical slit in bright sun. The habitus of a generalized boa, with broad head, stout body, and short, muscular tail, is also met with among many vipers; and both families have likewise produced more elongate, thoroughly arboreal species with notably prehensile tails. More significantly, perhaps, the facial pit of the crotaline snakes finds a close counter part only in the labial pits of the boids. (Pit-like structures occur in a few viperine and colubrid snakes, but are not especially well developed and are of unknown function.) Interestingly, some of these similarities could be involved with the caudal lure. The pupil modification permits vision in dim light without concomitant dazzling in bright light; and as men tioned, luring is carried on in dim light. The motion of the lure, described by Kauffeld (loc. cit.) as "peristaltic" and shown by Whar ton (loc. cit.) to be wave-like, is possible only to a species with a muscular tail. In boas, whether arboreal or not, the muscular tail functions during the constriction of prey. Pit vipers are not con strictors, yet they usually have muscular, even prehensile, tails. Allen and Swindell (1948) illustrated prehensility of the tail in the cottonmouth; I have noted it in the young copperhead, which can easily support itself from the tail tip only; Niceforo Maria (1933) remarked on the prehensile tail of the young fer-de-lance. Most</page><page sequence="21">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 193 of the red-tailed or yellow-tailed Bothrops and Trimeresurus are aboreal, with a prehensile caudal appendage. Only in rattle snakes is there a trend toward loss of caudal flexibility, and this is not especially evident in the more primitive species which have proportionately long, slender tails and small rattles. Sensory pits supplement vision, permitting an accurate strike even when the snake's eyes are masked (Klauber, loc. cit.; Noble and Schmidt, loc. cit.). This is not to contend that the characters, held in common by boas and pit vipers, have evolved in response to luring. Rather, the lure, a primitive character, is apt to be lost when a snake de velops diurnality; or some modification of the tail that limits its flexibility; or some method of prédation not involving sensitivity to infrared or visible radiation (as in the chemoreceptive tracking of prey); or a habit of preying upon organisms that cannot be lured. This theory would explain why the boids, primitive and possibly ancestral to several other snake groups, have not passed on the caudal lure to all of their descendants. It may be asked how widespread the yellow tail is among the Boidae. It does not occur in Charina and Eryx, burrowing snakes with a blunt tail resembling the head; nor in Lichanura of the arid southwestern United States and nearby areas. I find it lacking in broods of Epicrates striatus, E. cenchris, Corallus enydris, C. canina, Eunectes murinus, E. gigas, and Boa constrictor. The tail color is not known in Xenoboa, the Round Island boas (Casarea and Bolyeria, perhaps not truly boid), the pythons (several Old World genera), or in Loxocemus (probably not boid). It would not be surprising to find a yellow tail in the young of Ungaliophis conti nentalis of Guatemala, or in the Old World dwarf boas (Enygrus). Summary Except for some primitive species with vestigial "claspers" or anal spurs, snakes lack external, functional limbs. In the absence of limbs the tail has become modified for such diverse purposes as swimming, surface progression, burrowing, prehension and constriction, sound production, defense (by a sharp terminal spine), warning display, phragmosis, and mimicry (of a snake's head). Modification of the tail simultaneously extends, where necessary, to its shape, its color, and its use. It should therefore not be sur</page><page sequence="22">194 JOURNAL OF THE FLORIDA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES prising to find that the tail, normally somewhat vermiform, has in some species been modified into a lure which closely resembles a worm or insect larva. The caudal lure is present in the juvenile only, at least in those species that have been well studied. The modification of the tail involves a worm-like shape thereto; a bright color thereof, sometimes with a dark terminal spot remin iscent of a larva's head; and a habit of wriggling the appendage in slow, wave-like motion. In general, tail waving is carried on only when the snake is camouflaged, is in dim light, and is pro vided with suitable prey. Lizards and frogs, nearly all of which are visually oriented predators upon worms and larvae, are suscept ible to the lure, which they will actually try to grasp. Treefrogs, toads, anoles, skinks, and geckoes have been reported as attracted by the lure. The bright tail of the juvenile snake is usually yellow or yellow ish-green. Generally, with age the yellow tail darkens and be comes colored like the body. However, in at least one and perhaps several species, it becomes reddish. The function of the red tail tip is unknown, as is that of the black tail developed by a few species. A brightly colored tail tip, usually yellow, occurs in the young of most and perhaps all boas of the genera Tropidophis and Trachyboa; in three New World moccasins (Agkistrodon contortrix, A. piscivorus, and A. bilineatus) and at least two Old World ones (A. hypnale and A. halys blomhoffi); in at least three rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus klauberi, C. viridis helleri, and Sistrurus miliarius); in at least five or six New World lancehead snakes (genus Bothrops) and about nine Old World ones (genus Trimeresurus). Attempted luring, upon the introduction of prey, has been definitely reported for Agkistrodon contortrix, A. piscivorus, A. bilineatus, A. hypnale, and Crotalus lepidus klauberi; and somewhat less definitely for Bothrops atrox. Fully successful luring, resulting in the capture of prey such as lizards and treefrogs, has been noted for Agkistrodon hypnale and A. bilineatus. Attempted but unsuccessful luring in captivity is the fault of the experimenter who has not provided wholly nat ural conditions. Snakes that attempt luring in captivity may be inferred to carry on successful luring in nature. Indeed, one might infer that luring is carried on by all snakes provided, as a juvenile</page><page sequence="23">THE CAUDAL LURE OF VARIOUS JUVENILE SNAKES 195 and in both sexes, with a bright tail tip. Thus the discovery of luring behavior is to be anticipated in several additional Bothrops, Trimeresurus, Tropidophis, and the Trachyboa, at the least. How ever, several factors might exert selection pressure toward loss of the bright tail color, and the character is therefore apt to be vestig ial in some species or populations. For example, one might expect loss of the lure in Tropidophis inhabiting various small, ecologically unbalanced islands of the West Indies. The caudal lure may well prove vestigial in several Crotalus, perhaps Sistrurus miliarius, a few Trimeresurus, some Bothrops, and some Tropidophis. Sexual dimorphism of tail color, whether confined to juveniles as in Bothrops atrox asper, or evident at all ages, is inexplicable, but might be correlated with anatomical peculiarities of the tail in the male. Although the literature is scattered and at times tantalizingly incomplete, when it is collated it implies that one explanation will suffice to embrace all known cases of juvenile snakes with brightly colored tail tips. At least, all the observations and inferences can be encompassed by a single theory. It is postulated that the caudal lure is a primitive character, which has for various reasons been lost in several phylogenetic lines, but has been retained by some small boas and many pit vipers. In any event, possible exceptions and remaining problems should not obscure the interesting fact that in some snakes the tail of the juvenile is modified into, and successfully employed as, a lure for frogs and lizards.
