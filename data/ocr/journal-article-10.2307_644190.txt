They suggest a number of im- portant questions that historians and anthropolo- gists might ask to realize the potential of their ap- proach, and they make some insightful suggestions about specific issues-noting, for example, that sib- ling relationships have been relatively neglected by students of the family. Most of the 15 papers that follow address them- selves to 7 issues raised by the editors. A fascinating essay on inheritance and naming customs on the Greek island of Karpathos makes the editors' re- marks on the interrelationship of material concerns and affective relations marvelously concrete. Two articles, by Regina Schute and Vanessa Maher, con- cern the bond between mothers and children. They provide an unsettling demonstration of how the at- titudes of women to their illegitimate and/or female children are affected by material conditions and property relations. Three historical studies of re- gions of France and Germany explore the ways in which inheritance and the transfer of property struc- ture emotional relations. Martine Segalen and Alain Collomp discuss the interfamilial tensions that arose from inheritance practices in Brittany and Haute Provence. David Sabean examines conflict and cooperation between brothers-in-law in a South German village. The rest of the articles are concerned mainly with the family in changing political and economic con- texts. Andrew Strathern discusses relations between brothers in Papua New Guinea, weaving together family history, economic development, and poli- tics. Roger Sablonier's account of the Aaragonese royal family around 1300 is disappointingly con- ventional-an illustration, perhaps, of just how dif- ficult it is to make fresh observations about the rather stale subject of royalty. The family strategies of groups at the opposite ends of the social hier- archy, American slaves and West African blacks in contemporary Britain, are skillfully depicted by Herbert Gutman and Esther Goody. The latter's es- say is a tour de force of historical and cross-cultural analysis that succeeds in deepening our under- standing of servitude in medieval England and fos- tering among West African immigrants in contem- porary Britain. Karen Sacks and Louise A. Tilly at- tempt to show how family life and the organization of work affect one another. Tilly's analysis of the weavers of 19th-century Cambrai convincingly de- molishes earlier, antithetical hypotheses about the emotional climate produced by the family econ- omy and urges closer attention to the develop- mental cycle of the family. Finally, three papers by Hans Medick, Gerald M. Sider, and Karin Hausen examine customs that illuminate personal relations in particular economic regimes. Medick's fine study of spinning bees in early modern Germany wanders from the central topics of the collection-editor's privilege, I suppose. Sider provides a fascinating but rambling essay that shows how "scoffs" expressed the patterns of competition and cooperation pro- duced by the merchant tyranny that prevailed in Newfoundland fishing villages. Hausen's paper on the German Mother's Day is an expert and discour- aging demonstration of the capacity of commercial interests to manipulate the values and customs that govern relations within the family. Essays on so various an array of places and times might have been expected to yield general conclu- sions that are banal. Remarkably, these papers com- bine persuasively to prove that property relations and ties of sentiment are interconnected and to pro- vide a series of impressive demonstrations of how the links between them can be discovered. This is an important achievement that will confound the assumptions of many social historians. It should also cause them to reflect anew on the usefulness of anthropology to their craft. The historical anthro- pology of Western Europe has been preoccupied with mentalite and has generally neglected the con- nections between mental worlds and material life. The approach advocated by Medick and Sabean and realized by their contributors is one that should appeal to both historians and anthropologists, for it enhances the ability of scholars to integrate dispar- ate aspects of social life and to view them in a changing temporal context. This book marks a con- siderable advance in the methodology of family his- tory, and I hope that it will encourage similar stud- ies on other topics of common interest to historians and anthropologists. Kingship and Sacrifice: Ritual and Society in Ancient Hawaii. VALERIO VALERI (PAULA WISSING, transl.). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1985. 392 pp., tables, figures, notes, glossary, references, index. $40.00 (cloth), $20.00 (paper). JOCELYN LINNEKIN University of Hawaii at Manoa Valeri's long-awaited study of Hawaiian ritual is a brilliant and complex work, an intellectual tour de force. Empiricists who are not persuaded by the de- ductive methodology of Continental rationalism may find it audacious, but the analysis convinces because it is based on exhaustive and meticulous ethnohistorical research. In this work Valeri offers us at once a reconstruction of the major Hawaiian pre-Christian rituals, a semiotic analysis of Ha- waiian religion and society, a theory of the relation- ship between sacrificial rites and political power, and an important theory of ritual. This is surely the definitive work on Hawaiian religion and symbol- ogy to date, and it will be consulted for its relevance to other Polynesian semiotic systems as well. Valeri traces his intellectual genealogy to Hegel, Feuerbach, and Durkheim. From Hegel, he adopts the premise that religion is "the objectified system of ideas of a community." While rejecting Dur- kheim's "sociomorphic reductionism," he relies heavily on the Durkheimian notion of the efficacy of ritual and religious representations. Specifically, he asserts that ritual, by producing typical or "model" experiences, fixes in the minds of its par- ticipants the semiotic code and "mental disposi- tions" on which social and political relations are based. In this way, ritual reproduces society, and an 788 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="2">analysis of Hawaiian ritual is inextricably an anal- ysis of Hawaiian social categories. Valeri's introductory discussion of the sources is invaluable for anyone working with Hawaiian eth- nohistorical materials. He appears to have con- sulted virtually all the non-Hawaiian accounts of the early society as well as the major Hawaiian-lan- guage texts relating to ritual, and he discusses the biases, strengths, and reliability of each source. I am delighted to see this sort of treatment in print. Al- though evaluating the sources is crucial to ethno- historical reconstruction, such information is often transmitted only through the oral traditions of schol- ars, and the author's weighting is rarely systemati- cally presented. Valeri is also careful to use diacri- tics for Hawaiian words and names (although the macron is consistently missing in the plural forms such as kanaka[men] and aumakua[guardian gods]). Valeri focuses particularly on the luakini temple ritual, where the ruling chief offers human sacrifices (ideally, his rivals) and thereby confirms his con- quest of the land. To set the stage for a detailed anal- ysis of these rites, the first two sections of the book establish Hawaiian cosmology and present a theory of sacrifice. The last third of the book consists of a description and interpretation of the luakini ritual, which reproduces the social hierarchy in toto as god, sacrifier, and society pass through a series of patterned transformations. Valeri's premise is that sacrificial rituals "hierarchize" subjects by relating them to different gods. Lower-ranking men sacrifice to inferior deities; the king offers the most valued sacrifice and "creates society" by establishing the rank of all those below him. The Hawaiian gods are anthropomorphic and personify types of social beings. Their function is therefore normative: they symbolize and represent men in the course of the ritual. Valeri likens the luakini rites to "pro- grammed learning through activities that involve the apperception of codes, principles, concepts, and their reproduction in practice" (p. 344). In one phase of the luakini ritual, a god-image is tamed, passing from a wild, disordered, and individual state to an ordered collectivity. The god thus "re- constitutes" society through its ritual transforma- tion, and the king's role is crucial because he serves as the ideal man in this passage-an exemplar and also a mediator between the human and the divine. The best semiotic analysis resembles good liter- ary analysis and succeeds in making sense of a myr- iad of seemingly imcomprehensible details. Partic- ularly in his illumination of the luakini parapher- nalia and procedures, Valeri's method and rhetorical style are reminiscent of Levi-Straussian myth analysis. He makes the similarity explicit when he considers all the available versions of the luakini ritual as a set of transformations and pro- vides a running commentary on the differences be- tween the sources. I cannot do justice to the rich- ness of the detail in this review, but to explicate the meanings of particular procedures and icons he takes into account colors, shapes, spatial levels, di- rection, material, even fragances. To confirm sym- bolic associations, he calls upon linguistic conno- tations and mythic examples, providing in passing a brilliant interpretation of the Papa/Wakea primor- dial myth. Valeri stresses the unity of the system of sacrifices, and his discussion of "high" foods and the qualities of specific offerings fits well with my own work on modern Hawaiian exchange, where modern versions of the ritually high goods of old continue to be the stuff of socially significant offer- ings. In a work of such extraordinary detail, a reviewer is bound to find some linkages and conclusions less convincing than others. I will raise a few quibbles, then, stressing that these are quibbles rather than major criticisms. I am uncomfortable with citations to 20th-century sources such as E. S. C. Handy and Mary Kawena Pukui to support statements about precontact ritual. Valeri acknowledges that these sources are frequently derivative and may combine contemporary empirical data with attempts at re- construction, but he nevertheless uses them when they support his point. This is unnecessary because he has an arsenal of much better sources at his com- mand, and material from less reliable works could easily be omitted. I have reservations about Valeri's treatment of Hawaiian women. Women are peripheral to this work because they "have only a marginal relation to the sacrificial system" (p. 1 10). Men sacrifice- chiefly men in the temples, commoner men in their separate eating houses-whereas women do not. Valeri associates mana, efficacious power, with pu- rity and the divine. Women are categorically im- pure because they menstruate and bear children (thereby shedding blood). Although Valeri does not explicitly say so, the logic suggests that women can- not therefore possess mana. The categorical status of Hawaiian women may have been at odds with their social efficacy, however. To some extent Val- eri recognizes this when he notes that women, while ritually inferior, were equal to men in the ge- nealogical hierarchy; rank was bilaterally deter- mined. But he states that in the Hawaiian scheme, "sacrifice is superior to genealogy." Men are seen as active, while women have only a "passive" re- lationship with the gods, and this is "only natural" because of their association with sexual reproduc- tion (p. 114). This begins to sound suspiciously Western. Valeri's categorical equation may be quite correct, but I think that in some of the Hawaiian myths, at least, women could also be interpreted as active. I particularly take issue with his use of a quo- tation from David Malo's Hawaiian Antiquities (1951:82) to confirm his point (p. 113): "The ma- jority of women ... had no deity and just wor- shipped nothing." Malo's statement seems incon- sistent even in context because it comes at the end of a long list of female deities, and I think that it is not worth much as an assessment of the women's cult. The problem of Hawaiian women raises another issue: that of time and change. This work is essen- tially a synchronic study of the Hawaiian ritual scheme, and therefore rightly operates on the cate- gorical level. In his 1982 article "The Transforma- tion of a Transformation," Valeri gave us a more processual view and shared a brilliant vision of the diachrony inherent in the Hawaiian political and reviews 789</page><page sequence="3">ritual system. But Hawaiian women, with their con- textual efficacy, were also the source of a certain dynamic in the society-a force for change. I look forward to another breathtaking work where Valeri might synthesize these different potentialities. Huarochiri: An Andean Society under Inca and Spanish Rule. KAREN SPALDING. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1984. xi + 364 pp., figures, tables, photographs, notes, refer- ences, index. $38.50 (cloth). HENRI FAVRE Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris In this important book, Spalding expounds the re- sults of her research on the Sierra of Lima in light of the thematic studies she has been carrying out on the Andean populations for more than 15 years. We find in Huarochirf, fully developed and harmoni- ously intertwined, several ideas that the author has presented in various articles published in English and Spanish that have significantly contributed to the advancement of the history and the ethnohistory of the Andes. In nine masterly chapters, the book "tells the story of the construction of a social relationship of inequality and oppression in a portion of the An- dean highlands of central Peru" from pre-lnca times to the fall of Spanish colonial rule, as it is stated in the Introduction. Before the Inca conquest, which does not seem to have left important traces here as in other regions, Huarochirf corresponded to the territory of a stratified agrarian society. Kinship re- lations governed the access to land and to the labor force that was needed to exploit the resources of a vertical mountain environment. Kinship and terri- toriality were the bases of sociopolitical units ap- parently similar to those that existed elsewhere in the Andes and that are generally interpreted in terms of dualist organization by most ethnohistori- ans. Spalding proposes another interpretation, which is not new, but whose validity and greater ca- pacity for explanation are confirmed once more. Under the moiety system, which is perhaps an in- novation introduced by the Incas for administrative purposes, she reveals a system of hierarchized and nested polities. Although she refuses-which is her privilege-to qualify them as segmentary, she shows that these polities segmented. A permanent movement of dissidence and secession operated in them, as is strongly suggested by the manuscript of Avila. The political instability that this movement of segmentation generated certainly helped to foster endemic warfare to which most of the early colon- ial sources of pre-lnca Andes refer. Besides, the fragility of power, constantly threatened by the secessionist tendency of the subordinated polities, might explain the peculiar ways of the exercise of authority that have been described by Murra. In fact, the dynamic model used by Spalding could be applied more audaciously and profitably. The Inca conquest, says the author, did not change the organization of production at the re- gional level. The Incas extracted surplus by making the mechanisms of corvee and other labor services that existed before them function to their benefit. The Spaniards tried to do the same in the framework of the encomienda, until the demographic catastro- phe caused by European diseases, against which the Indians were not immunized, led to the eco- nomic collapse of the 1560s. The chapter dedicated to the study of the reorganization of Peru directed by Viceroy Toledo in the next decade is the key- stone of the work. In this chapter, Spalding shows that the setting up of new, truly colonial modes of exploitation at the end of the 16th century corre- sponded to the assertion of the exclusive rights of the Spanish Crown against the interests of all the so- cial sectors of Peru, and that it was conditioned largely by the rise of the absolute monarchy in Spain as well as by the rivalries of the European powers on the world scene. The following chapters treat the consequences of the colonial system on the social, economic, and political organization of a region which was transformed into a province of a worldwide empire and whose fate had to depend henceforth on decisions made beyond the ocean according to purely metropolitan considerations. These consequences were numerous. The pyramid of polities progressively eroded, and the Indian no- bility tended to blend into the peasant mass. Kin- ship networks, already dismantled by epidemics, fi- nally decomposed. The land they controlled in- creasingly passed into private ownership. The social relations of production, which were based on reciprocity, became monetized. In the 18th cen- tury, land and labor were already bought and sold in some villages of Huarochirf, whose economy was more and more oriented by the market of Lima. The Indians' reactions against the colonial system and its catastrophic effects appear to have been lim- ited. On this point, the conclusions that Spalding draws from her analysis of the 1750 rebellion and from the participation of a descendant of an old no- ble family in the wars of Independence are not en- tirely convincing, however balanced they are. From the 16th century to the beginning of the 19th, Huar- ochirf rebelled twice, and twice only. We would scarcely find calmer provinces, quieter villages, more peaceful peasants in Europe during the same period. It would be better to acknowledge openly that the Indians tolerated the Spanish domination and even that they accommodated themselves to it. After all, oppression, far from mechanically precip- itating insurrection in those who endure it, alienates the oppressed and leads them to accept as normal, and sometimes as legitimate, what seems to be un- acceptable. The Church certainly played-more successfully than Spalding is ready to admit-an es- sential role in the "moral disarmament" of the In- dians. It would be useful to study the Church, no longer as an institution that extirpated idolatries, but as a true state ideological apparatus. It is impossible to convey in a few lines the rich- ness of this work, which captures a regional society within the various spheres of power that include and determine it (Peruvian viceroyalty, Spanish em- pire, European world), but which does not ignore, for all that, the Andean context in which the region is inserted.
