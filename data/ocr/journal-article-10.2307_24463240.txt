<plain_text><page sequence="1">126 MILTON QUARTERLY Further Thoughts on Satan's Journey Through Chaos Michael Lieb I Several years ago, I attempted to determine imagistically the scatological dimension of Satan's journey through Chaos in Book II of Paradise Lost.1 That journey, I maintained in The Dialectics of Creation, involves, among other things, an ironic debasement of the Arch-Deceiver in scatological terms.2 Entering Chaos' "Furnace mouth," which belches forth its innards (II. 888-89), Satan becomes part of the "crude consistence" (II. 941) that characterizes Chaos' "intestine broils" (II. 1001).3 As such, he participates in a process of intestinal decomposition that finally expels him as "waste" through the opening of what Milton variously calls the "bare outside of this World" (III. 74) and the "backside of the World" (III. 494). There, he is buffeted as the "sport of Winds" (III. 393) in a place "since calld / The Paradise of Fools" (III. 495-96). In that way, his journey nicely illustrates Raphael's adage that excess "soon turns / Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Wind" (VII. 129-30). Assuming the imagistic validity of this scatological point of view, I would now like to explore some of its biographical and historical implications. Biographically, Milton had prepared for his account of Satan's journey as early as his infamous 1628 Prolusion VI on "Sportive Exercises."4 Just as the appended poem "At a Vacation Exercise" anticipates in part the "graver subject" (/. 30) of what will be Milton's future epic endeavor, the prose section of the projusion foreshadows the comic elements of that undertaking. Reminding his colleagues that "the feast of Hilaria ... is at hand," Milton encourages them to "raise loud laughter from . . . [their] saucy spleen" (XII, 229). If he finds one colleague not laughing with due lack of moderation, he will conclude that this person either is concealing rotten teeth or has stuffed himself so full at breakfast that he is afraid that "not his Sphinx, but his sphincter anus, [will] accompany his mouth in its incantations, and against his will babble some riddles." These riddles, in turn, will be deciphered not by Oedipus but by doctors "who relax the bowels." "Unwilling that the groan of a posterior by the sound of its cheery voice should make a din in this assembly," Milton is also averse to noises emitted from the other end, especially if they are accompanied by such "deep and deadly exhalations" that they outvie Aetna and Avernus and kill off the neig. jors with their stink (XII, 229). Nonetheless, he praises his colleagues for journeying through the flames of Tartarus to hear him, in spite of "that gleaming Cerberus" which threatens on one side and the "blazing and all devouring . . . furnace [which] belches forth lurid flames and rolls out tortuous balls of smoke" on the other. Having welcomed his colleagues so in Hell, Milton finally transports them to Heaven, where, hopefully untainted, they "have left purgatory behind and have issued from the fiery furnace, saved by some new miracle" (XII, 231). Such has been their "dangerous and fearful" "journey" (XII, 235). The significance of the references is unmistakable. Milton's "excremental vision," to use Norman O. Brown's catch-phrase,5 appears fully articulated from the outset. The anality of Hell causes the perilous journey to take on distinctly unsavory overtones: the passage through the lower regions to the upper regions smacks of the passage of bodily gases through the anus or the mouth as a function of the digestive process. Milton's colleagues are at once conceived as the bodily vehicles for such a passage (they are, after all, the "student body" or Academiae juventute) and as the voyagers themselves. They are at once the devourers and the devoured. The collocation could not be more appropriate. It is no accident that, once Milton's colleagues reach the upper world, they are promised "a sumptuous banquet" (XII, 235) as part of this feast of Hilaria. Upon reaching the upper world, Satan, we recall, is compared to "a Vultur on Imaus bred" "bent on his prey" (III. 431,441). He too is the devoured (compare IV. 77) and the devourer. What could be more fitting in an epic concerned with the distinction between proper and improper eating? Indeed, the propriety of such an act concerned Milton throughout his career. In Christian Doctrine, for example, he argues against the doctrine of the Real Presence because of its unsavory digestive implications. With their emphasis upon the physicality of the Host, the Papists, Milton maintains, "have well nigh converted the Supper of the Lord into a banquet of cannibals" (XVI, 197). In that banquet, Christ's flesh is devoured not only by the communicants (good and bad alike) but even occasionally by "the mice and worms," all of whom will indiscriminately attain "eternal life" as the result of eating "this heavenly bread." As if those observations were not repellent enough, Milton concludes his line of thinking with an idea so repulsive that the good Bishop Sumner could not bring himself to translate accurately: "si carnem comedimus, non in nobis manebit, sed, ut dicam quod</page><page sequence="2">MILTON QUARTERLY 127 honestissimum est, in ventriculo coctus tandem exudabitur" (XVI, 194). Whereas the language is brutally explicit, Sumner clouds the issue by talking in general terms about "food['s]" "being carried off partly by natural transpiration, and partly in other ways" (XVI, 195). I suppose it takes the twentieth century to confront the import of what Milton says. The new Yale translation of John Carey comes about as close as possible: "Whereas if we eat. . . [Christ's] flesh it will not remain in us, but to speak candidly, after being digested in the stomach, it will at length be exuded."6 The vision is almost Swiftian in its repulsiveness. It is not for that, however, so unique as to single out Milton's views as an aberration. His mentality, as Erik Erikson would concur, has its roots in the kind of perspective that Luther embodied. Inspired by the Spiritus Sanctus on the cloaca or toilet, Luther proclaims at the dinner table, "Ich bin der reiffe dreck, so ist die welt das weite arschloch" ("I am like ripe shit" and "the world is a gigantic ass-hole"). This was the man who, at the height of his leadership, "made 'Furzesel' (fartass) out of the family name Farnese, and had woodcuts made representing the Church as a whore giving rectal birth to a brood of devils."7 Defending Luther's frankness (III, 314-15), Milton would not have been shocked at this language. As we know, Milton forever eschewed an "excremental whiteness" (IV, 311): he was as much inclined to expose the world's "loathsome uncleannes" and "harden'd excrements" that cause God to "vomit" (III, 12,48 49), as he was to extol its higher attributes. "Scrupl[ing] not to name the Dunghill and the Jakes" (III, 308), he saw himself as one who, in cleansing and "scrowring" the filth of his enemies, "had the labour ... to carry dung out of the Augean stable" (IV, 271). Doing so, he exhorted all those who failed to understand the wisdom of his ways "to sit upon the stool and strain, till their cross dispositions and contrarieties of mind . . . change to a better correspondence, and to a quicker apprehension of common sense, and their own good" (IV, 251). Responding to all this, perhaps Professor Erikson would find in Milton what he finds in Luther: a nature that must repudiate "an appointed enemy on the outside in order to avoid victimizing and, as it were, eliminating itself."8 Certainly there is the temptation to psychoanalyze. If Edmund Wilson were to put Milton up on the couch, he would no doubt diagnose Milton—as he does Ben Jonson—as an "anal erotic," characterized by an "infantile preoccupation with the contents of the alimentary tract."9 To what extent Milton may be so diagnosed, I do not claim to know. A full psychobiography of Milton has yet to be written, although psychological studies continue to appear.10 I would be more inclined to place Milton's emphasis upon the bodily processes within an historical framework and to suggest once again the centrality of the body and all its functions to the traditions he inherited. II So I suggested in a Milton Studies article entitled "Milton and the Organicist Polemic,"11 and so I recapitulate briefly here. For one who, like his contemporaries, viewed the world as "one huge" "personage" (III, 38), the organicist point of view is a natural. Deriving from "ancient Hindu, Chinese, Greek, and Roman writers," organicism had a major impact upon Western thought and is today a sociological commonplace. In the Renaissance, it appears in works ranging from Edward Forsett's A Comparative Discourse of the Bodies Natural and Politique (1606) to Richard Bernard's The Isle of Man (1626). At least five bodily categories are delineated in Francis Gray's The Judge's Scripture (1637): "body celestial," "body astronomical," "Body natural," "body economical," and "body politic." In the polemical arena, I have shown that the tendency "to formulate one's position through a bodily correspondence" was so pervasive in the Renaissance that "controversies in general tended to resolve themselves into arguments about bodies."12 If Milton's polemical practices are no exception to this rule, his poetical practices are equally as "organicist" in their bearing. The Chaos of Paradise Lost represents a case in point. As David Masson long ago recognized, the "hot, cold, moist, and dry" elements that "strive" for "Maistrie" in Chaos are none other than the humors of a gigantic elemental body.13 Chaos is envisioned not only in personified form as an "Anarch old" with his consort Night (II. 988, 960-63) but in anthro pomorphic form as "one Huge" "personage." Out of that personage emerges the world's body, equipped with its own "vast anthropomorphic digestive sys tem"14 (V, 414-26). It is that very system which prompts Thomas Kranidas "to view the middle section of Paradise Lost [Books V-VI] as operating under vast organic metaphors," according to which the "dinner scene uses a central metaphor of digestion" and the War in Heaven a "metaphor of physical purgation."1* Examples could proliferate. Suffice it to say that the conventions which inform this outlook are so common</page><page sequence="3">128 MILTON QUARTERLY place that Ernst Curtius classifies them among his "corporal" and "alimentary" topoi.le Those topoi, in turn, would hardly be foreign to someone like Phineas Fletcher, whose Purple Island (1633) is, as Leonard Barkan makes clear in his recent book-length study of the body as metaphor, the "most exhaustive treatment of the human body ever composed."17 Anyone who has made his way through the whole poem would certainly concur. Among the physiological correspondences one finds there, the most interesting for our purposes are those concerning the digestive system, where "the Islands common Cook, Concoction," with his attendants, makes certain that the process of digestion occurs temperately. "Garbage" and "filth, whose scent the place annoyes" are eliminated "by divers secret waies in under-sinks." These lead to "port Esquiline, " which "lies" "in darkest valley" "between two hills." As soon as "the gate opes," the waste "empties it self, far thence the filth out-throwing." The whole process is accompanied at times by the "raging of windes" in "Aeols court," "shut close within a cave the windes encaging."18 At a later point in the poem, the scatological imagery depicted here characterizes the Dragon and his crew.19 As is well known, Fletcher's organicist practices are indebted to The Faerie Queene where the physiological correspondences are likewise of central importance. One thinks particularly of Book II on Temperance. There, that sterling virtue is portrayed by the House of Alma. Contrasting implicitly with the Cave of Mammon, which leads nowhere but into the "mucky filth" of "hell-mouth," the House of Alma opens into the bodily compartments of the well-ordered soul. Among the compartments that Guyon and Arthur traverse in their journey through Alma's realm, the stomach is of most importance to us. In the stomach, the two knights encounter, notably, Concoction and Digestion, whose office it is to make certain that food is properly assimilated into the body anjl that waste finds its appropriate outlet through either the urinary tract or the anus: "But all the liquor, which was foule and waste, / Not good nor serviceable elles for ought, / They in another great round vessell plaste, / Till by a conduit pipe it thence were brought: / And all the rest, that noyous was and nought, / By secret wayes, that none might it espy, / Was close convaid, and to the backgate brought, / That cleped was Port Esquiline, whereby / It was avoided quite and throwne out privily."20 In Miltonic terms, Satan's experience in Chaos is precisely to the point. Traveling the "crude consistence" of Chaos' waste winds, Satan is "close convaid" to the "backgate" of the world's "Port Esquiline" or imperial dump, where he is "avoided quite and throwne out privily."21 The repercussions of his excremental egress are significant indeed. In effect, they comically, even triumphantly, recast the physiological correspon dences established by Spenser and Fletcher. Both poets would concur fully with Milton's handling of Satan's egress. If the Satan of Paradise Lost were to travel through their realms, that is precisely how they would dispose of him. To give the whole matter a slightly mythological flavor, I might suggest that in Paradise Lost the bodily accoutrements of The Faerie Queene and The Purple Island undergo a kind of metamorphosis of Ajax. Sir John Harington would not blanch at the pun. In fact, his treatise on the privy or "jakes" consistently views the Satanic world as a place of filth.22 The outlook is in keeping with Milton's practice of depicting the "stench" of up-turned mountains in Hell (I. 237) and the "disemboweling" of cannons in Heaven (VI. 584-89). Ironically, the very substance that propels the cannon balls through their "hollow Engins" (VI. 484) also propels Satan himself through the "hollow dark" of the "vast vacuitie" (II. 953, 932). A "tumultuous cloud / Instinct with Fire and Nitre" (II. 936-41), that substance is the "Sulphurous and Nitrous Foam" dredged up in Heaven by Satan and his crew from "Th'originals of Nature in thir crude / Conception" (VI. 511-13). Convertible into gunpowder, that "Smuttie grain" (IV. 817), it is associated by Milton in no uncertain terms with oral and anal discharges as it "belches" and "disgorg[es] foul" upon the "Victor Host" in Heaven and "embowel[s] with outrageous noise the Air" (VI. 584-89). Its proper element is the "combustible / And fewel'd entrails" of Hell, where its explosive qualities "aid the Winds / And leave a singed bottom all involv'd / With stench and smoak" (I. 233-37). Propelling Satan through Chaos, it is finally "Quencht" in a "Boggie" mire, "neither Sea, / Nor good dry land" (II. 939-40). Its fate is befitting all that is excreted from what we might call the Porta Stercoris of Chaos.23 The aura befits the Satanic milieu. Milton no doubt read with gusto Dante's account of Malacoda's anal trumpet blast in Hell, or he might have recalled Chaucer's reference to all those friars swarming out of "the develes ers."24 Milton's depictions resonate with the comedy of such scenes. With its delight in the crudely physical, his comic realism, in fact, recalls not only Dante and Chaucer but Rabelais.</page><page sequence="4">MILTON QUARTERLY 129 Satan meets Chaos</page><page sequence="5">130 MILTON QUARTERLY Paradise Lost is part of a tradition that extends from Gargantua and Pantagruel to Gulliver's Travels and beyond. From the organicist perspective, Rabelais could not be more appropriate. As Erich Auerbach makes clear in Mimesis, Rabelais represents a prime example of that comic realism concerned with "the physical body and its functions" which distinguished the early stages of the Renaissance.25 To prove his point, Auerbach singles out Book II, Chapter 32 of Gargantua and Pantagruel. Entitled "How Pantagruel Covered a Whole Army with His Tongue and What the Author Saw in His Mouth," this chapter portrays the organicist perspective in its most graphic form. Having spent six months inside Pantagruel's throat during a battle campaign, Alcofribas finds the throat populated with new worlds. Among other things, he discovers a "plague" "raging" in the cities of Larynx and Pharynx, "due, apparently, to a noxious, malodorous and infectious exhalation which had been rising out of the abyss for some time now." The exhalation, of course, is none other than "the unsavory breath emanating from Pantagruel's belly." After Alcofribas emerges from Pantagruel's mouth, the giant questions him about his experience. Having satisfied himself that Alcofribas could have existed in his throat so long, Pantagruel finally asks, "But where did you cack?" The answer: "Down your throat, my Lord."26 I am not suggesting specific parallels between Alcofribas' journey and Satan's (although such parallels obviously exist); rather, I am pointing toward a tonal similarity that reveals the extent to which Milton's organicist techniques share much of that comic realism—that delight in "the physical body and its functions"—which Auerbach saw as a hallmark of early Renaissance art. For our purposes, this characteristic reaches its high point in such poems as Ben Jonson's "On the Famous Voyage."27 In that poem, the excremental vision is portrayed in exactly the mock epic terms that distinguish Satan's journey through Chaos. As Jonson conceives it, the voyage traces the course of two heroes, Shelton and Heyden, up Fleet Ditch in a rowboat from Bridewell Dock to Holborn. The setting is modeled on classical versions of journeys through the underworld. Departing from Avernus, the voyagers encounter "that ugly monster / Ycleped Mud," which "Belch'd forth" her "merd-urinous load" (11. 61-65). "Thorough her wombe they make their famous road," where "Hung stench, diseases, and old filth" (11. 66 70). Offended by the sound of "privie[s]" and "guts wind-bound, / Over [their] heads," they are fearful lest the inhabitants will "beshite" them (11. 72-92). To add to their misery, they are surrounded by the "ridiculous" atoms of "late departed" "farts," which cause "those thicke frequent mists / Arising in that place, through which, who goes, / Must try the unused valour of a nose" (//. 125-32). These mists, Jonson conjectures (much as Milton does in his reference to the "tumultuous cloud" that is "Quencht" in a "Boggie" mire), either "stuck upon the wall, / Or were precipitated down the jakes" (11. 136-37). Passing from Styx to Acheron, the voyagers finally enter Pluto's hall. In a brief mock-epic poem, then, Jonson anticipates the journey Milton's Satan is to take in full epic style. In either case, the journey is accompanied by bodily correspondences that I have already shown to be central to Renaissance thought. It remains finally to suggest the ultimate source of those correspondences as they manifest themselves in Milton's concept of Chaos. To do that, we must explore the origins of Chaos in myth. There is where we shall find the roots of the organicist concept of Chaos both as elemental and as bodily phenomenon, at times portrayed with almost primitive crudity. Ill We may begin with one of the oldest known epics of creation, the Babylonian Enuma Elish (ca. 2000 B.C.). In that epic, the primeval waters assume an anthropomorphic form as the female figure Tiamat, who engages in a cosmic battle with Marduk god of thunder. Marduk destroys her by driving in "the Evil Wind that she close not her lips. / As the fierce winds charged her body, / Her body was distended and her mouth was wide open. / He released the arrow, it tore her belly, / It cut through her insides." Then, "He split her like a shellfish into two parts" and bounded her waters. From her spit, he created the clouds and filled them with water; from her udder, he formed the mountains;1 piercing the udder, he made wells; with her crotch, he fastened her to the heavens."29 As scholars have recognized, this anthro pomorphic vision of Chaos finds its correspondence in the Chaos of the Biblical account. Conceived as Tehom, Rahab, Leviathan, Tannin, and Nakhash, the watery monster is defeated by Jahweh as a prelude to creation.3" The process is archetypal. In the myths of Canaan, Mot, god of death and sterility, swallows Baal, god of fertility, after which Mot is overcome, Baal reborn, and fertility returned to the universe. As we can see from the following description of Mot as world-monster, the bodily perspective is all-important: "[A Lip to ea]rth / A lip to heaven / [And to]ngue to</page><page sequence="6">MILTON QUARTERLY 131 the stars / So that [Baa]l may enter his inward / Yea descend into his mouth."31 In this connection, one thinks of Hesiod's Theogony. Ouranos, we recall, keeps pushing his dreaded offspring back into their mother Gaia to prevent them from being born, until his son Kronos emasculates him; from his blood spring the Furies, from the foam of his testicles, Aphrodite. Kronos, in turn, swallows his offspring and is then made to vomit them up as he is overcome by Zeus.32 This genealogical myth has ties with the Hittite Kumarbi legend of the vizier who swallows his master's testicles, only to find to his dismay that he is pregnant with the storm god Teshub. Not being female, Kumarbi is put to the expenses of finding an opening to let the storm god out. Teshub is particularly anxious about the whole affair because he fears that he will wind up being excreted from Kumarbi's anus, which will certainly "defile" him. Nor does he especially wish to exit through the ear or any of the other orifices that he has at his disposal. Perhaps he winds up exiting through the mouth, since Kumarbi does spit out seeds that bring forth offspring. But the tablet is too badly damaged to say.33 In any case, birth from the god or monster, whether out of the belly, the mouth, the ears, or the anus, is universal in mythopoeic thought. As a "rite of passage," it inevitably involves the experience of being swallowed up, digested, and then reborn from the monster's maw.34 From this perspec tive, it is especially significant that the giant fish which swallows and disgorges Jonah becomes, according to Jonah's own words, a symbol of Sheol, "the belly of hell," from which Jonah is reborn (1. 17 2.2 Given that context, it is no accident that in Paradise Lost Chaos for Milton becomes "The Womb of Nature and perhaps her Grave" (II. 911). With its ties to mythopoeic thought, it is none other than Tiamat, that elemental monster big with wind through the forces of Marduk who subdues the primeval waters; Tehom, Rahab, Leviathan and the other monsters overcome by Jahweh to create the universe; and, finally, all those gods, among them, Ouranos, Gaia, Kronos, and Kumarbi, that swallow bodies or parts of bodies to imprison them, digest them, and then disgorge them as new births. If the swallowing up of Jonah is akin to being taken into the belly of Sheol, the swallowing up of Satan and his crew by "Yawning" Hell (V. 874-75) merely recapitulates, albeit comically, a basic mythopoeic pattern. Satan thereafter has a perpetual fear of being swallowed up by lower deeps "still threatening to devour... [him]" (IV. 75-76). No wonder: once in Chaos, he finds himself practically "swaflowed up and lost / In the wide womb of uncreated night" (II. 149-50), until he undergoes a mock birth from the monster's innards. His birth, as I have discussed at length in The Dialectics of Creation, represents a perversion of the creative process, a veritable uncreation.35 Its referent is in the degenerate form of creativity typified by the birth of Sin, Death, and the Hell Hounds from their respective progenitors stemming from Satan himself. The relationships are too complex to recount here. Suffice it to say that Satan's birth from the monster recalls the basic pattern established by the monster Sin, from whose "entrails" Death is violently born and from whose "Bowels" the Hell Hounds burst forth, only to return to devour their mother's innards (II. 777-802). They are driven on by their father Death, who, in turn, would devour his own mother-consort if he could (II. 803-07). He must wait instead to devour man, who will be his prey until the time that Death ironically becomes the "Gate of Life" (XII. 571), the birth-giver, and the redeemed issue newly born from his "maw." Then, Satan, along with his degenerate offspring, will return to the monster, not to devour, but to be devoured. The Satanic process of birth from the "entrails" and "Bowels" that are in turn devoured as a dog returns to its vomit (Prov. 26: 11) will then be realized with a vengeance by the unwitting Hell Hounds of God (X. 630). Having "lick[ed] up the draff and filth" of the pollution they created, Satan and his offspring will, in effect, be made to eat their own excrement. "Cramm'd and gorg'd" near bursting with their "suckt and glutted offal," they will be "hurld" through Chaos, where "the mouth of Hell" will be "obstructed]" forever and "his ravenous Jaws" "seal[ed] up" (X. 629-37). Followed to its conclusion, the Satanic process of birth will thereby be turned against itself in a paradoxical act of cleansing. To quote the Elder Brother in Comus: "But evil on it self shall back recoyl, / And mix no more with goodness, when at last / Gather'd like scum, and setl'd to it self / It shall be in eternal restless change / Self-fed, and self-consum'd" (11. 593-96). Because of that fact, the excremental vision culminates in a promise of ultimate purity; "Heav'n and Earth renew'd shall be made pure / To sanctitie that shall receive no stain" (X. 638-39). Conceived scatologically, Satan's voyage through Chaos is one part of a larger conception that eventuates not in the mire of the Satanic world but in the sanctity of a higher vision.
