In our modern time we find many works which present to the reader various means by which meditation or mysticism can as suage our anxieties, frustration, and frag mentation. These four works approach this practical form of meditation/mysticism for the modern seeker of truth. My approach in this multiple review will be to briefly re view the works and their central thesis and problems and then to add a caution to the type of approach that is presented by two of the books. For those who know the work of Heinrich Dumoulin in A History of Zen Buddhism, this book will add to their"Tcnowledge of Japan ese Buddhist thought. It is a book of dia logue between Christianity and Buddhism cen tering upon preparation, mutual recognition and cooperation, experience, Buddhist spirituality and mysticism, and lastly, Ultimate Reality and the Personal. The. idea of dialogue permeates this work and presents itself at various places throughout the book. He recognizes the difficulty of the task and discovers! "The authentic mystical experiences in East and West converge, and the points of contact are not limited to the higher forms. The entire way of Higher Meditation in Christianity and Zen Buddhism glows with the fervor of mysticism" (p. 19). He believes that the world view of Teilhard de Chardin could be a path to realize this goal (p. 24), correctly observes that dia logue does not mean amalgamation (p. 34), 53</page><page sequence="3">and lends an interesting insight into the problem of social service as conceived by these two religions. Further, he out lines the major differences on Revelation and Metaphysics, and notes that there is no single religious notion in Buddhism which exactly corresponds to the absolute reality Christians call God (p. 96). He distinguishes Buddhism from Gnosticism (p. 133 ff.). He calls for a "negative theology" which would more easily be open to dialogue, and which would correct an over-emphasis on anthropomorphic theology (pp. 167-9). This book represents a complementary study to his previous work in the field, and expresses the creative, rather than the historical approach of Dumoulin. At times his insight is penetrating and most informative and the over-all vision of the work is well conceived. The problems that I have with this work are few. I think that Dumoulin has mis understood, perhaps because of his Chris tian vision, the nature of Nagarjuna's thought, which he calls "negative theology" (p. 18). It is difficult for me to under stand the context of theology when for all practical purposes there is not a theos. I also question his joining of Eastern and Western mysticism, since I believe, as I will briefly outline later, that there is a radical difference between them. His observation that doctrinal systems play a minor role in Buddhism (p. 112) is akin to a non-Christian observing that there is really no difference between the Roman Catholic and Baptist view of Christianity. 54</page><page sequence="4">The whole history of Buddhism shows us the doctrinal differences. Again, he uses orthodox Christian words in his statements of Buddhism, as when he speaks of the Buddhist way of salvation (p. 1^5). Also, I do not understand his reference to "ambiguous monistic metaphysics of Mahayana Buddhism" (p. 14?). But these are minor problems and for those who wish a good in troduction to Japanese Buddhism and a Christian approach to dialogue, Dumoulin's work is well worth reading and pondering. In Zen Meditation for Christians, Father Enomiya Lassalle gives us a more practical book of meditation in a Buddhist context. He divides his work into two parts. The first deals specifically with the histori cal background of Zen meditation, a com parison to Christian meditation, the fruits of Zen meditation, and Satori. Part two is primarily concerned with mysticism. He observes what he terms as the nonthinking of the mystics, the Way of Absorption, En lightenment, the Cloud of Unknowing, and finally Zazen as Christian meditation. Father Lassalle presents an excellent outline account of Zen practice and method and the place of the Master. He distin guishes Christian meditation as discursive and Zen as object-less. He observes a re lationship of Zen to Eckhart and The Cloud of Unknowing (p. 32). When he speaks about Satori, he begins by relating the experi ences of the Hindu Sri Ramana Maharshi (p. 54 ff*) and moves to Zen. In his anal ysis of mysticism he leads us through a psychological interpretation of the experi ence of the mystics, concentrating first 55</page><page sequence="5">on John Tauler, and leads us to a compara tive chart between Zen and Christian medi tation and mysticism (pp. 129 f?). The book presents Lassallefs case very clearly, and shows an understanding of methodology in both traditions. The major problems I found with this work are two. The first concerns the ele vation of psychology to a status by which different things seem the same. This is more or less acknowledged in numerous places (pp. 41,92,105,114,122,162). The second concerns p. 67 and his comparative chart on 129 ff. Let me note his observa tions on the former, my comments, then the latter and my comments. ,fThe enlightenment of Zen is an experience of God in a certain sense . . . Leaving the word fGodf aside for a moment, we can say without reserva tion that enlightenment is an 'experience of Being1. . . . For the Buddhist, it is absolute being that is experienced in Satori, regardless of his naming it so or not, or even of his experiencing nothing ness, emptiness. That is the ultimate and absolute reality" (p. 67). The problem here, for those not familiar with Bud dhism, is that the Buddhist never can understand what is meant by enlightenment as an experience of God or even of Being in an Absolute Way (for this is one reason Buddhism rejected Hinduism). I do not know of, although there may be, any learned Buddhist who would agree to this statement about Satori and absolute being. Here Fr. Lassalle is placing words in the mouth of one who refuses to speak. We are deal ing with a radically different understanding 56</page><page sequence="6">of language and what it can signify. Con cerning the chart on page 129 and following, there are certain very misleading Christian words which carry important consequences! sin, being, personal absolute, guilt. There is also the minor point of how one can speak of a soul in Zen (p. 1^3). The work thus has problems but, as a general introduction to the psychology of Zen and Christian medi tation, it serves a purpose. The best work in this reviewerfs opinion is Dom Aelred Graham's Zen Catholicism. It reads very easily and encompasses an excel lent understanding of the differences be tween Zen and Roman C?tholic thought. The author is Thomistic, which gives him a cri tical insight into things that seem to go together. He divides his work into eight chapters with three supplementary discus sions and a most interesting postscript. In the main body of the work, Dom Graham recon structs the present situation in Catholic thinking and presents it and Buddhism as at tempts to answer the spiritual questions of man. He critiques our modern world and com pares this to egocentricity and the driving force behind Buddhism and Christianity, which are viewed with a careful eye. He then compares Zen meditation experience with mysticism. His concluding three discussions on Yoga, Monasticism, and St. Thomas are ex cellent. His postscript, the best part of the book, is a critique of Walter Kaufmann1s critique of religion. The major problem of this work, which does not affect Graham's conclusions, is a serious mistake in South Asian religious history. 57</page><page sequence="7">He, time and time again (pp. 71185t95t lW infers that the essence of Buddhism is to be found in the Vedantic tat tvam asi (that art thou)f and that Buddhism teaches a doctrine of inner self (Atman) which is the same as Ultimate Self (Brahman) (p.27)# This is simply not true as it was precisely this concept which early Buddhism, and, by extension, all subsequent Buddhism, re jected and spurned. Yves Raguin, S.J. has written a non scholarly book in his Paths to Contempla tion. As he writes in the first part of the work, it is the statement of one who practices what he teaches. It is not meant to be anything other than a blueprint or map of contemplation. It is therefore a practical work for those who wish to par ticipate actively in this path toward God. This map takes the traveler through Scripture, Christ, and the Sacraments to the art of contemplation, where God in vades the soul, and through which one can begin to understand the ineffable language of God. This book is written by a devout Christian for both Christian and non Christian who wish to understand the Church and her mysteries, and for those who wish to participate in the life of contemplation. These four works would probably be found under the area called "mysticism" in your local bookstore. However, each does not specifically deal with mysticism proper but rather tfith meditation and contempla tion. In the works of Dumoulin and Las salle, there is an attempt to adapt Zen thought to a Christian context. I believe 58</page><page sequence="8">both of these attempts fail. Dumoulin fails because the book actually becomes an intro duction to Japanese Buddhism, and tends to ignore orthodox Christian categories of faith and reason. To use Teilhard de Chardin in this way misses the cosmic im plications of his Christogenesis. Lassalle bases his analysis on psychological similarities, and it is interesting as far as it goes but misses the deeper ontological differences between Zen Buddhism and the Christian faith. Let me close by observing that comparative mysticism, like comparative religion, must follow the slow path of understanding other positions of faith on their terms, rather than on what we would wish them to believe or from our standpoint of commitment. I believe that we do this both consciously and unconsciously. One example is when we take psychology or sociology as the method of truth rather than the method of compara tive religion, which itself has enough dif ficulty in its appointed task. I would like to suggest in closing that one approach that can be used is to ask such questions of each position ast 1) Its view and value of history; 2) Its view of the nature and mean ing of religious language (revelation)i 3) The view of the nature of persons; 4) The ultimate objective and meaning of his tory, religious language, and persons. In this approach one should concentrate not only on ontological and non-ontological positions but their expression in various epistemologies within the tradition. This is a method which will allow positions to exist alongside each other and not be 59</page><page sequence="9">subsumed under a different position. In this we must at all times be aware of the continuity of religious traditions, for example,, under standing that Japanese Zen is an expression of Chinese Chfan, which is in turn an expression of the Indian Vijnavada (Yogacara) and Madhyamika schools of the Mahayana.
