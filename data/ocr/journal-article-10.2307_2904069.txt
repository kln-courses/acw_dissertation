<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious: An Interfacing of Novelist Baraka and Friedrich Nietzsche Ikenna Dieke The Dionysian is the horror of the annihilation of the principium individuationis and at the same time "rapturous delight" in its destruction. It is therefore comparable to intoxication, which dissolves the individual into his collective instincts and components-an explosion of the isolated ego through the world. Hence in the Dionysian orgy, man finds man. -Carl Gustave Jung, Psychological Types On an earlier occasion in this Forum, I discussed the feminine principle in Baraka's novel The System of Dante's Hell and the ways in which this principle related to the homecoming of the black prodigal, Roi, within the broad schema of Sadean poetics (see Dieke). I established that, toward the end of his mythopoeic quest, Roi had changed from Roi/Airman to Peachesman. However, the meaning of that symbolic transformation lies not merely in the carnal relationship between him and Peaches, the Cyprian archetype, but instead within the broader context of a tragic faith which channels that relationship into profounder essence. I am speaking, of course, about the more potent archetype in the novel-the chthonic archetype of the Dionysian spirit. An in-depth exploration of the configuration of this archetype brings into focus the prima facie convergence of Friedrich Nietzsche's metaphysical thought and Baraka's voluntaristic vision in The System of Dante's Hell. Generally speaking, Nietzsche's influence on modern and contemporary art and literature has long been recognized by Ikenna Dieke, a comparativist, holds a Ph.D. from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and currently serves as Chair of the English Department at Allen University.

For example, the dramas of Pinter, Ionesco, Beckett, Brecht, and many others, "in their attempts to come to terms with the absurdity of human existence, and to preserve human dignity in the face of a reality that seems paradoxical and senseless" (Pfeffer 65),1 contain radical manifestations of Nietzsche's tragic faith and metaphysical conceptualization of art, grounded in the categories of becoming and the senses. The symbolic quintessence of this tragic faith is Dionysus, who, according to Nietzsche, represents the passionate and tortured search for a meaningful life, beyond any objective ground of moral principles. In The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche makes a distinction between what he calls the Apollonian and the Dionysian imaginations. The Apollonian artist, he explains, is like the philosophical worker who creates values, who determines and formalizes some large reservoir of value judgments. The Apollonian artist overpowers, abbreviates, and makes visible an ordered past. On the other hand, "the Dionysian artist plunges into time, risks himself and his world in the flux, dark to all except his desire, to the elan of the dance to which he abandons himself' (Dooley 158). Douglas Jones, expounding on the thesis of Dionysian aesthetics, has said that, in a time of disintegrating culture, it is the Dionysian imagination which we need to cultivate, abandoning ourselves to Eros and the deepest springs of our desire. Cultivating the Dionysian imagination is in keeping with the Nietzschean aphorism that "the greatest epochs of our lives come when we gain the courage to rebaptize our evil as our best" (Dooley 158). My position is that, in The System of Dante's Hell, Baraka assumes the role of the Dionysian artist, an artist opposed to Dante, whom Baraka sees very early in the novel (in the Epigraph) as being allowed no other function except that of watering down the moral ideas of Platonic-Christian orthodoxy. The meaning of this Dionysian role is played out within the context of four symbolic frames: the nihilistic, the tragic, the Dionysian, and, finally, the frame of the heroic individual, or what Nietzsche has called the "Overman" and Baraka the "Peachesman." The nihilistic frame is, for Nietzsche, the frame of despair and anxiety. Nicholas Berdyaev calls it "Nietzsche's torment" (82). Baraka's nihilism, like Nietzsche's, derives from what Jules Chaix Ruy refers to as "the decomposition of culture" (96). Its genesis is in the uncompromising viewpoint that all traditional values and beliefs are unfounded, and that all existence is consequently senseless and useless. Like Nietzsche, Baraka is haunted by nihilism, the devaluation of values. Again like Nietzsche, Baraka knows that no longer can we trust our old gods, our</page><page sequence="3">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 101 traditional, orthodox values and goals; no longer can we believe in the exclusive power of reason and science. Religion and morality appear to have lapsed into a state of crisis, vitiated into what Martin Buber has characterized as "the eclipse of God" (see Pfeffer 68), Nietzsche as "God is dead," and Baraka as "jewchrist, that's hunkie bread, turned green." Baraka vents his nihilistic anger on almost every page of the first half of the novel. The nihilistic chord is first struck in the novel's epigraph, leaving a rather jarring, disturbing note: I put The Heretics in the deepest part of hell, though Dante had them spared, on higher ground. It is heresy, against one's own sources, running in terror, from one's deepest responses and insights ... the denial of feeling ... that I see as basest evil. (Jones 7) This quick, unapologetic swipe at Dante has colossal Nietzschean implications. Like Nietzsche, Baraka insists that the feeling for life, not for some otherworldly existence, provides the only sane justification for man. Dante's quest for eternal meaning among the cloistered tombstones of Judeo-Christian morality is misguided, given the phenomenal fact that this morality summarily deprecates life; that is, this life here on Earth. The epigraph echoes Nietzsche's repudiation of the eternal, immutable values and axiological assumptions of Plato's realm of ideas and the transcendent, supersensible norms of Christianity. Both philosopher and novelist suggest that the transcendental metaphysics of Western civilization denies reality to the world we live in-the world of the objective senses, of feeling and emotion, of mutation and dialectic (change and opposition)-and ultimately degrades it into a secondary world of semblance, simulacrum, and pathetic illusion. Baraka carries his nihilistic sentience even on to the very end of the novel. In the postscript, titled "Sound and Image," for example, Baraka attempts a personal transvaluation of Hell: What is hell? Your definitions. I am and was and will be a social animal. Hell is definable only in those terms. I can get no place else; it wdn't exist. Hell in this book which moves from sound and image ("association complexes") into fast narrative is what vision I had of it around 1960-61 and that fix on my life, and my interpretation of my earlier life. (153) In other words, Baraka like Nietzsche rejects the mythology of the traditional Christian interpretation that places hell in an otherworldly realm. Nietzsche himself claims that nihilism is deeply rooted in Christian morality. "For our adherence to Christian morality,</page><page sequence="4">102 Ikenna Dieke Nietzsche says, we must pay dearly: by this adherence we are losing our equilibrium and are on the verge of adopting opposite valuations-those consisting of nihilistic elements" (see Wright 278). Baraka's nihilism, Nietzschean and nonpathological, does, however, hold out the possibility of some redemptive alternate order. His alternative to a transcendentalized noumenal inferno is a distinctly socialized hell, for there is no world, reality, or realm which transcends that in which we live and move. So the hell of traditional, orthodox Christian theology and metaphysics appears, in the author's view, more contrived than real and substantive, whereas the more phenomenal hell of Baraka, the Black nihilist, and Nietzsche, the white agnostic, represents the closest thing to the existential truth. Baraka's nihilism, like Nietzsche's, also expresses a longing for a new, uncoerced relation with and definition of the divine: Finally, God, is simply a white man, a white "idea," in this society, unless we have made some other image which is stronger, and can deliver us from the salvation of our enemies. For instance, if we can bring back on ourselves, the absolute pain our people must have felt when they came onto this shore, we are more ourselves again, and can begin to put history back in our menu, and forget the propaganda of devils that they are not devils. Hell is actual, and people with hell in their heads. But the pastoral moments in a man's life will also mean a great deal as far as his emotional references. One thinks of home, or the other "homes" we have had. And we remember w/ love those things bathed in soft black light. The struggles away or towards this peace is Hell's function. (Wars of consciousness. Antithetical definitions of feeling(s). (153-54) Though anti-Christian, and short of endorsing a blind impulse toward an anthropomorphic Black deity, Baraka cannot be charged with anti-religion. He may be one of Nietzsche's "great despisers," but he is also, by the same token, one of his "great reverers." Baraka's world, like Nietzsche's, consists mainly in the repudiation of the dualistic separation of God and Nature. It does not express a negation of all faiths, but rather reveals the tragic predicament of modern man who has lost his faith in a transcendent, anthropomorphic God. Baraka's God, like Nietzsche's or Goethe's or Spinoza's, faces an entrance into the qualitative primacy of consciousness, into the totality of being, without moral deduction, without axiological pontification, where good and evil, the ugly and the beautiful, the normal and the bizarre, the finite and the infinite, the sublime and the ridiculous, the limited and the limitless, dwell side by side in a kind of reciprocal Manicheanism, where, in</page><page sequence="5">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 103 Nietzschean terms, "even the ugly and horrible are redeemed and made meaningful in the fatality of the whole" (Pfeffer 260). For Baraka, the relation of God and the oppressed/downtrodden people should not be construed in purely abstract, theoretical terms, understandable by the discursive intellect alone, but must proceed instead from the totality of being, touching the very depths of the black soul, the unconscious black psyche. It must be a relation that is lived, experienced, and suffered. It must take place within the sphere of the daemonic and the Dionysian, within the checkered reality of struggle, dialectical tension, negation, and despair, and be understood essentially as a desire and drive to connect and relate and unify Black history, and thus express the fundamental essence of the Black world, the Afrocentric world view. The alternate image of God on which Baraka insists as a sine qua non for black selfhood has all the glorious resonances of Rastafarian philosophy. It is coterminous with the peculiar attainment of unassailable harmony with oneself and the whole, the whole represented by the enjoined, redefined image of God. Baraka like Nietzsche demands that redemption be found in this world and not in the world beyond, within tragedy and suffering and historical/ dialectical materialism, not necessarily beyond it. This sense of the tragedy of life and the devaluation of all values is not for Baraka a mere accident. In fact, insistently and consistently Baraka draws attention to this fact. In "Neutrals: The Vestibule," for instance, Baraka admonishes us to: look at things in another light. Not always the smarting blue glare pressing through the glass. Another light, or darkness. Wherever we'd go to rest. By the simple rivers of our time. Dark cold water slapping long wooden logs jammed 10 yards down in the weird slime, 6 or 12 of them hold up a pier. Water, wherever we'd rest. And the first sun we see each other in. Long shadows down off the top where we were. Down thru grey morning shrubs and low cries of waked up animals. (9) This is an exceedingly ticklish symbolic scenario of the breakdown of traditional, orthodox values. "The first sun we see each other in" is the old sun, the traditional Western world view, now smudged through the cynical shadows of skepticism, a process which renders the idea of a transcendent, noumenal realm not only unattractive to Baraka, but also starkly elusive and pale. "Down thru grey morning shrubs and low cries of waked up animals" suggests the dawn of the nihilistic era in which the search for absolute truth is abandoned. This in turn leads to the psychological "breakup of my sensibility" (9). The asceticism of the transcendent morality is also summarily called into question:</page><page sequence="6">104 Ikenna Dieke Even that asceticism you pulled in under your breast that drunks &amp; school- friends thought of as "sense of humor" . . . gone, erased, some subtle rot disposed in its place. Turning towards everything in your life. Whatever clarity left, a green rot, a mud, a stifling at the base of the skull. No air gets in. (13) What is left after the devaluation of the transcendent morality is for Baraka an aimless becoming in which all dialectical tensions between good and evil, between the veridical and the delusory, appear to have tailed off. We are set adrift, left apparently with nothing, no support, no inspiration. Conscious of that, the protagonist, Roi, cries out passionately: I feel sick and lost and have nothing to place my hands on.... Everything I despise some harsh testimonial of my life. The Buddhism to affront me. (14) "The Buddhism to affront me" suggests the extreme form of nihilism which Nietzsche regards as the European form of Buddhism. Like Nietzsche, Baraka equates Buddhism with Christianity; both are perceived as religions of exhaustion and negation. With its nirvana, Buddhism seeks a pure state of freedom from karma, the extirpation of desire, passion, the empirical self, instinctual drives, those things that validate the here and now.2 But by far the most nihilistic scenario in The System of Dante's Hell involves the brutalization and flagrant desecration of the deistic, natural, and creative world order. Baraka portrays this desecration in terms of violence "against one's self, / against / God, Nature and Art" (36). For both novelist and philosopher, God exists in the creative activities of nature and man. It appears that Baraka, like Nietzsche, finds in the dynamic forces of the cosmos and the eternal Viconian cycle of destruction and creation, death and rebirth, the very basis of the unity of immanent God, nature, art, and the creative genius of man. Thus, reality for Baraka does not necessarily lie exclusively in the Christian transcendent realm alone, but instead with nature and the art which mirrors it, of which man is an integral part. We recall Goethe's conception of the universe as a cosmic unity of God, nature, and man (see Pfeffer 167). Baraka's nihilistic spirit is a spirit that places no faith in a transcendent God, but in a God immanent in this world, whose effulgence is fundamentally linked with the productive, regenerative forces in nature, man, and his creative expressions. The destruction of this unity engenders a fundamental loss of purposefulness, a fundamental shattering of a moral world order. Roi no longer possesses ideals and absolute goals toward which to strive:</page><page sequence="7">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 105 Nothing to interest me but myself. Disappeared, even the thin moan of ideas that once slipped through the pan of my head. The night is colder than the day. Two seconds lost in that observation. The same amount of time to stroke Nijinski's cheek. One quick soft move of my fingers on his face. That two seconds then that same two if they would if there were some way, would burn my soul to black ash. Scorch my thick veins. (15) In despair and dread, Roi faces the dilemma of existence without the comfort and security of eternal goals, normative constructs, and categorical imperatives in which he was once schooled. He is now a black man, lost, without a Westernized God, and for now, at least, without the promise of a better, meliorist world. Baraka's nihilistic spirit reaches its fever pitch in "Seven (The Destruction of America" (35-36), in which nature, mingling with the grisly scenario of dead Indians, provides a kind of apocalyptic vision of the social condition in America, the destruction of which the author finds infinitely desirable for its own sake, independent of any constructive social engineering or willed mobilization. However, for Nietzsche and Baraka, the crisis of nihilism should not be a pretext for man to will nothingness, to accept the void as his eternal guide or companion. Nihilism, as a historical movement, is for both philosopher and novelist not destructive but tragic, containing within its negative ideology and rhetoric the very basis for regenerative growth. As in Baraka's Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note (1961), The Dead Lecturer (1964), and Black Magic (1969), a nihilistic current is latent in every creative fount of black history in which an affirmative cultural plane is achieved, in which there is a gem of what Clyde Taylor calls "creative orientation" (1 13). In his Unpublished Notes 223, Nietzsche underscores the point succinctly: "The symptoms of decline belong to times of enormous growth; each creative, powerful movement of humanity has at the same time produced a nihilistic movement." The next task beyond the nihilistic stage is to find what Nietzsche calls "the exit and hole through which one arrives at something," to construct a new culture that can lead mankind out of the suffocating hole of nihilism (Pfeffer 79). For Nietzsche, constructing this new culture is metaphorized into an act of philosophizing with a hammer. But the hammer, for Nietzsche, is not only a tool of destruction but also an instrument of deconstruction and reconstruction-both functions are involved in the vital creation of new values. Nietzsche declares: "He who hath to be a creator in good and evil-verily he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values in pieces" (Wright 155). In Baraka's novel, where belief in the whole system of Western values and meanings Roi had lived by is lost, Roiman is abandoned</page><page sequence="8">106 Ikenna Dieke to himself and faces nothingness. Roi tells us: "Nothing to interest me but myself. Disappeared, even the thin moan of ideas that once slipped through the pan of my head" (15). But the void does not drive Roi into futile resignation, or into weak pessimism and permanent nihilism. Being a higher individual, a Nietzschean hero, he feels the void both as loss and as liberation. It is not mere non- being and perpetual darkness. Roi understands Nietzsche's argument that this kind of void is the greatest challenge in human history, including his own history. Consequently, for now he becomes fully responsible to himself. Roi is convinced that he is a survivor. The narrator tells us that he had survived the evilest time. A time alone, with all the ugliness set in front of his eyes. His own shallowness paraded like buglers across the dead indians. Some time, some space, to move. (19) It is essential that Roi survive these evilest times in order to be assured a second chance to tap his creative spirit. His expression of the tragic spirit boils down to the personal resolve to move within a distinctly phenomenal space: "All I want is to move. To be able to flex flat muscles" (19). What Roi wishes for is a space to move; the void left by the collapse of the deistic, natural, and moral world order is for him a Nietzschean space, a space of freedom. It is not the space of Democritus and Dante, which is empty; it is not even a space for the ontological interpretation of evil. Instead it is for Roi a new positive, affirmative space. Paul Tillich, in The Courage to Be, states that "no actual negation can be without an implicit affirmation" (176). While Nietzsche manifests this implicit affirmation by wielding the hammer, Baraka through Roi will be "frank in armor thrust[ingJ out his sword" (21). He will never surrender his will. He remains defiant: "I am awake in your cold world" (28). The void that he faces is a potential space of freedom, freedom to create new values and systems of meaning. For Baraka and Nietzsche, freedom can be achieved only after the destruction of the old idols and empty traditions. In deontological terms, it is a departure from the Christian and Dantean conception, in which freedom exists only in the transcendent world of the Christian paradiso of the Kantian noumenal, and is based on metaphysical and moral beliefs and attitudes that negate or "condemn life." The new space that Baraka's Roi longs for exists "beyond good and evil," independent of traditional moral categories and their transcendent, metaphysical assumptions, which Roi characterizes as a pack of lies (32). It is not based on a rigidly dualistic world order,</page><page sequence="9">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 107 but is meaningful for this life only, the life of the senses, of conflict and despair. It is the foundation of a new article of faith and secular piety. Roi's talk of putting on his armor and sword (21) embodies a celebration of the heroic will to destroy and, in destroying, to build and create anew. Like Shaw's Undershaft, Roi finds this creative will in the devil, whom he sees as the spirit that eggs him on to "break out" (36), insistently heeding the call: "Let us create a new world. Of Sex and cataclysm. The rest, let them languish on their Sundays. Let them use shadows to sleep" (51). Baraka calls this heroic will "high tragedy" (52). Thus, the meaning of the tragic spirit is the courage to face something that can infinitely outweigh all struggle and anguish. It is the affirmative spirit which can aid the black man in America in this age of anxiety to surmount racial injustice, cultural displacement-in short, the whole nihilistic foundation of modern life-without recourse to what Rose Pfeffer describes as the "optimistic illusions and mechanisms of escape" (36). It is an affirmative vision arrived at through the most uncompromising nihilistic position, in full realization of the negative elements of life. For Baraka the basic elements of this tragic spirit are struggle, pain, and opposition; each is metaphysically grounded in and derived from life and a sense of beingness. They cannot be eliminated without destroying life itself. However, as Roi discovers, they can be made to function as cathartic stimulants in the evolution and development of the black personality and culture by a process Nietzsche calls "overcoming." For Baraka as well as Nietzsche, the nihilistic and the tragic visions are linked by a certain ineffable complementarity. For Nietzsche, the archetype of this complementarity is the god Dionysus. Dionysus is Prometheus, Faust, Zarathustra; he is skeptic, critic, destroyer, builder, and creator. He is the "Ur-Eine," primal oneness and the ground of being, ever contradictory and ever suffering; he is Schopenhauer's eternally striving will.3 He is also the will to power, the will to overcome, to affirm, and to create. Dionysus is Nietzsche's symbol of modem man who has lost all traditional values and beliefs and faces nihilism and despair. But he also represents the heroic individual who overcomes nihilism and finds a new meaning of life, one that Nietzsche designates as Dionysian and tragic. I apply the term Dionysian to Baraka's imagination in System in the same way that Nietzsche would employ the term. In The Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche provides this exegesis: "The saying yes to life even in its strangest and hardest problems; the will to</page><page sequence="10">108 Ikenna Dieke life, rejoicing over its inexhaustibility even in the very sacrifice of its highest types, that is what I call Dionysian" (Pfeffer 173). I suggest that the last pages of the novel-that is, the whole of "The Heretics"-dramatize the Dionysian Spirit, which is a spirit of synthesis in which negation and affirmation, suffering and joy, are reconciled. I suggest that Roi's descent into the midnight underworld of the Bottom and the Joint is a descent into the world of Dionysian nuptials. I suggest that Roi is Baraka's black prototype of the Dionysian hero, a hero born out of primal instincts and urges, orgiastic rites and drunken frenzy, all of which Dionysus represents. I suggest that Roi is Baraka's creation of the heroic Dionysian attitude of the higher individual who has the courage to stand alone and self-reliant, neither comforted by Dante's compensatory heaven nor protected by illusory categories of mind. Roi also recognizes that destruction and annihilation are part of the eternal cycle of life and death, and of the everlasting change that pervades all nature. He knows that contradiction, evil, and suffering belong to the very essence of black life, yet he does not turn away in hatred or, worse still, resignation or negation. In his very failure and despair, Roi the Dionysian man fulfills himself, recognizing that "it is out of the deepest depth that the highest must come to its heights" (see Nietzsche 226). Notice in the following passage how Roi affirms life in spite of, or even because of, tragedy, understanding it in terms of its perils and potentialities, its nothingness and its greatness: Empty man. Walk thru shadows. All lives the same. They give you wishes. The old people at the window. Dead man. Rised, come gory to their side. Wish to be lovely, to be some other self. Even here, without you. Some other soul, than the filth I feel. Have in me. Guilt, like something of God's. Some separate suffering self. Locked in a lifeless shaft. Light at the top, pure white sun. And shadows twist my voice. Iron clothes to suffer. To pull down, what had grown so huge. My life wrested away. The old wood. Eyes of the damned uncomprehending. Who it was. Old slack nigger. Drunk punk. Fag. Get up. Where's your home? Your mother. Rich nigger. Porch sitter. It comes down. So cute, huh? Yellow thing. Think you cute. (134) Earlier on we have heard him affirm life even in the face of benumbing death: And they tell me there is one place/ for me to be. Where it all comes down. &amp; you take up</page><page sequence="11">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 109 your sorrowful life. There! with us all. To whatever death. (121-22) In other words, Roi is molded out of the Dionysian myth of suffering and death, of being constantly sundered from himself. ("Split open down the center, which is the early legacy of the black man unfocused on blackness" [153], Baraka writes near the end of The System.) Roi's suffering is the Dionysian pathos connected with the age- long concept of Rausch, which Nietzsche defines as "the psychology of the orgiastic as an overflowing feeling of life and power where even pain has the effect of a stimulus" (Nietzsche 173). In simpler terms, Rausch is a Dionysian quality which refers to states of alcoholic intoxication and to the orgiastic abandon experienced in impassioned dancing, sexual intercourse, and the like. Let me suggest that the story of the Bottom underworld, like that of the Joint and the Cotton Club, is an exploration of the psychology of the orgiastic. The Bottom is the consummation of the tragic culture achieved through the Dionysian passion which recognizes suffering, pain, and contradiction as essential elements in the productive activity of life and art, which, in order to create, must first destroy; in order to affirm, must first deny and annihilate. The central motif of this Dionysian psychology of the orgiastic is the dance, music. Baraka describes it with remarkable succinctness: The dancing like a rite no one knew, or had use for outside their secret lives. The flesh they felt when they moved, or I felt all their flesh and was happy and drunk and looked at the black faces knowing all the world thot they were my own, and lusted at that anonymous America I broke out of, and long for it now, where I am. We danced, this face and I, close so I had her sweat in my mouth, her flesh the only sound my brain could use. Stinking, and the music over us like a sky, choked any other movement off. I danced. And my history was there, had passed no further. (129) Let me suggest that, like the Dionysian music, the music of the Bottom brothel, to which its inebriated customers dance, transports them into a state in which the artificial boundaries between people, black and white, and the limits of space and time, are broken down, leaving them to savor a sense of quasi-mystical oneness, a sense of what Levy-Bruhl identifies as participation mystique (de Laszlo 77). The music reveals a world that is unknown and seemingly unknowable to reason with its fragmentizing, isolating activity, a world which instead can be grasped intuitively by feelings and</page><page sequence="12">110 Ikenna Dieke instincts. It penetrates to the primal force of life, which is, to Baraka and Nietzsche, the human will in its unadulterated form. Nietzsche has said that in the Dionysian music "the gospel of universal harmony is sounded; each individual not only feels united and reconciled with his fellow man, but at one with him, as if the veil of Maya had been torn apart and there remained only the vision of mystical Oneness" (Nietzsche 121-24). I submit that what Roi actually experiences in the dithyrambic, syncopated rhythm of the Bottom music is a state of Dionysian frenzy, a state of exultation which includes suffering and pain as part of the primordial definition of the black experience. He feels deeply a sense of joy and realizes that, in spite of terror, pain, and relative deprivation, life is at base indestructibly powerful and creative. And yet there is another sense in which the brothel rite is linked with the Dionysian unconscious; this is the area of "creative madness." According to Walter Friedrich Otto, the Dionysian nature is one of madness, a madness inherent in a world itself, not the passing or lasting derangement that comes as a disease, or even a sickness or degenerative state, but the companion to one's "most perfect health" (142). Roi's transformation from a nihilistic pervert to a more or less extroverted tragic-Dionysian hero is conceived within the mythos of Dionysian creative psychopathy. The first indication of this comes just before Roi descends into the Bottom. As he trudges his way to the Bottom, the whole vision of his mythopoeic quest becomes somewhat transpersonalized into a suspenseful moment of creative insanity: But it was dusty. And time sat where it could, covered me dead, like under a stone for years, and my life was already over. A dead man stretched &amp; a rock rolled over ... till a light struck me straight on &amp; I entered some madness, some hideous elegance .... (119-20) Like Saul of Tarsus on the dusty road to Damascus, Roi is profoundly moved by this strange encounter. From his deeply felt response to the tragic living conditions in the Bottom comes the second indication of the kind of infinite madness he is up against. The Bottom is like some life drained off in silence. Under some grey night of smoke. They roared thru this night screaming. Heritage of hysteria and madness, the old meat smells and silent grey sidewalks of the North. Each father, smiling mother, walked thru these nights frightened of their children. Of the white sun scalding their nights. Of each hollow loud footstep in whatever abstruse hall. (125)</page><page sequence="13">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 111 The final indication, and perhaps the most direct and deathly, comes from the inscription on the brothel wall directly above the entrance door: "The neon winked, and the place seemed mad to be squatted in this actual wilderness. 'For Madmen Only'" (126). These three indications are conceivably part of Baraka's strategy of stressing the Dionysian mania symbolized by the brothel, a mania which provides a visionary explanation of a state in which man's vital powers are enhanced to the utmost, in which consciousness and the unconscious merge toward the inner growth of the individual. Baraka associates Dionysian madness with the churning up of the essence of black life, surrounded by the eternal storms of death, deprivation, and destitution. Since the tumult of creative insanity lies waiting in the bottom-most depths and makes itself felt in a noisy kind of way, all of life's ecstasy is stirred up by Dionysian paroxysm and is about to frolic beyond the bounds of controllable rapture into an infinitely dangerous wildness. The elements of creative madness associated with Roi's eternally striving will, as in Euripides's The Bacchae, provide the underground storm which splits up the stratified civilization of the West epitomized by Dante, the Christian pilgrim, from which Roi has received the conscionable injunction to "break out" (29), to "break, Roi, break" (134). Finally, a discussion of the Dionysian in The System of Dante's Hell will not be satisfactorily conclusive without mentioning its relation to the primordial concept of the "eternal feminine." Peaches is the main symbol of this eternal feminine. Carl Kerenyi suggests that the myth of Dionysus relates to women in terms of their overflowing vitality, their milk and physical energy, their qualities as nurses and maenads (13). J. J. Bachofen states that the appeal of the Dionysian mythos is primarily to women. It is among women, argues Bachofen, that it finds its most loyal supporters, its most assiduous servants, and their enthusiasm is the foundation of its power (101). On the basis of these enunciations, I submit that Baraka's Peaches is the maenad of Dionysus, the Dionysian heroine of Ikarion, the love-stricken Eros who summons Roi, a young black man who also embodies Dionysian qualities, to the hot game of unrelenting love and dance. She and the other prostitutes are the bearers of the brothel's Dionysian cultus, the strange mistresses of wine and wonder. Like the Dionysian maenad, Peaches welcomes a timid youth, then lures, cajoles, and throws him unrepentantly into the seething cauldron of orgasmic and voyeuristic encounter through the mystery of his transformation into a true Dionysian protege. Notice how Baraka describes their lovemaking, a description which has all the dark trappings of Dionysian intensity:</page><page sequence="14">112 Ikenna Dieke She rolled on me and, after my pants were off pulled me on her thick stomach. I dropped between her legs and she felt between my cheeks to touch my balls. Her fingers were warm and she grabbed everything in her palm and wanted them harder. She pulled to get them harder and it hurt me. My head hurt me. My life. And she pulled, breathing spit on my chest. "Comeon, Baby, Comeon ... Get hard." It was like being slapped. And she did it that way, trying to laugh. "Get hard ... Get hard." And nothing happened or the light changed and I couldn't see the paper woman. (139) The paroxysms of intoxication and sexuality represent the Dionysian via media to the sublimest gratification of the primordial unity. In the erotic encounter between Roi and Peaches, the artificial distance between "opposites" or strangers is annulled, a process which Jung describes as conjunctio oppositorium. Thus the Dionysian vision, within the mythos of anima-animus encounter and cohabitation, provides a profound insight into how a renewal of life may come from seeming evil. Renewal comes about through the assistance of the femme fatale and through the painful acceptance of what had hitherto not been cared for, what had previously been rejected or disowned, hence not really internalized. That regarded as evil may have been so, while it was allowed to remain unexperienced. Baraka had been raised as LeRoi Jones by orthodox Christianity, according to which sex out of wedlock is regarded as lewd and sinful. But Roi experiences what Edward Whitmont has described as "the orgiastic quality of sex" (226), or what I call the metaphor of seductive eros, the image of the unrealizable maternal unconscious in each one of us, coming to fruition in a moment of transformational erotic encounter, and he becomes bound by Peaches's viewpoint, which is designed to minimize its perceived evilness. This is the moment when traditional evil becomes rebaptized in a cultural, Nietzschean, and Jungian sense. While Dante would affirm ultimate reality by encountering it in ascetic, repressive, and suppressive virtuousness, Baraka, like Nietzsche, would uphold it in the primal majesty of ecstasy and joy expressible in Dionysian orgiasm. To achieve our individual wholeness, we are compelled to risk the experience of our own evil, an act that would allow us the capacity to express its energy in constructive ways. It seems as if the devil, in the shape of our anima, has applied the sting to make us find new ways out of our dilemma. So then what is the underlying meaning of the Dionysian vision? Nietzsche, in The Birth of Tragedy, offers one plausible answer: "Under the charm of the Dionysian not only is the union between man and man reaffirmed, but nature which has become alienated,</page><page sequence="15">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 113 hostile, or subjugated, celebrates once more her reconciliation with her lost son, man.... Now the slave is a free man; now all the rigid, hostile barriers that necessity, caprice, or impudent convention have fixed between men are broken. . ." (Nietzsche 37). This sense of reconciliation, this vision of freedom, Roi experiences all around him through his Dionysian encounter with Peaches. The passionate Dionysian orgy of the Bottom awakens him to a new, significant sense of wholeness and affinity with his previously unappreciated heritage. The sun that had once paled during the dark period of his alienation and egotistical inflation now shines in the moment of his cultural epiphany with a bright lustre: "The sun, thru that one window, full in my face. Hot, dust in it. But the smell was good. A daytime smell. And I heard daytime voices thru the window up and fat with optimism" (146-47). Roi is so ecstatic about this moment that he declares gleefully: And I felt myself smiling, and it seemed that things had come to an order. Peaches sitting on the edge of the bed, just beginning to perspire around her forehead, eating the melon in both hands, and mine on a plate .... Things moving naturally for us. At what bliss we took. At our words. And slumped together in anonymous houses I thought of black men sitting on their beds this saturday of my life listening quietly to their wives' soft talk. And felt the world grow together as I hadn't known it. All lies before, I thought. All fraud and sickness. This was the world. It leaned under its own suns, and people moved on it. A real world of flesh, of smells, of soft black harmonies and color. (147-48) Roi, thus emancipated, might very well be overhearing the distant echoes of Nietzsche's voice: A spirit thus emancipated stands in the midst of the universe with a joyful and trusting fatalism, in the faith that only what is separate and individual may be rejected, that in the totality everything is redeemed and affirmed- he no longer denies.... But such a faith is the highest of all possible faiths: I have baptized it with the name Dionysus. (Pfeffer 258) With this feeling of emancipation and joyful reconciliation, Roi arrives at a new sense of self. His transformation is a veritable rite de passage in a somewhat Gennepean sense. Roi is no longer another faceless airman running after strange, incomprehensible values, but a truly rejuvenated Peachesman: "Into that sun. The day was bright and people walked by me smiling. And waved 'Hey' (a greeting) and they all knew I was Peaches' man" (149). Roi, as airman, is Nietzsche's "herdman," the thing to be overcome in each of us. Where the herdman's life is shrouded in ambiguity and anonymity, that of the Peachesman is focused-on blackness. Roi is now the black inheritor of the Nietzschean Ubermensch, egged</page><page sequence="16">114 Ikenna Dieke on by what Paul Tillich has described as the courage of despair. We see this courage of despair borne out in Roi's heartful affirmation: It was a cloud I think came up. Something touched me. "That color which cowardice brought out in me." Fire burns around the tombs. Closed from the earth. A despair came down. Alien grace. Lost to myself, I'd come back. To that ugliness sat inside me waiting. And the mere sky greying could do it. Sky spread thin out away from this place. Over other heads. Beautiful unknowns. And my marriage a heavy iron to this tomb. "Show us your countenance." Your light. (149) Like the fate of Nietzsche's Overman, Roi's fate is the victory of the human spirit; its ultimate given is not opposition, but synthesis and reconciliation. The result of the Overman spirit in Roi is to see greatness and beauty even in the face of the horrible and ugly in black experience, to exult over suffering and pain, and to affirm the superior creative vitality of native Dionysian spirit. Roi is like Goethe's Faustian man, who has turned away from revealed, sanctioned truths and solipsistic pedantry toward hallowed truths, toward communal, chiastic existence as he wanders with Mephistopheles through life's depths and heights, its infamy and glory. Roi's experience as Peachesman takes place within the struggles and tensions of the heroic will to overcome. His is an experience leveled in tragic vision, one that culminates in an affirmation of life and a savored glorification of the totality of all being, where the devil himself is present in heaven and the horrible and infamous are accepted as necessary and sacrosanct. The path to the Peachesman is like the path of Childe Roland, a path fraught with dangers and risks, and it leads all those who take it through an abyss, to the dark tower, the Bottom. The essential quality of character which Roi shares with Nietzsche's Overman is his titanically striving will, expressed in Nietzsche's will to power and symbolized by Goethe in the Eternal Feminine. Like Arthur Schopenhauer, Amiri Baraka in The System of Dante's Hell is driven by the voluntaristic and pessimistic metaphysics of his age, a metaphysics which parts with Cartesian rationalism and the transcendentalized dicta of Dante Alighieri. Again like Schopenhauer, Baraka believes that the innermost essence of the world which underlies all things is a blind impulse toward existence, an arational, ceaselessly striving, instinctual, and suffering will. This impulse pits Baraka against the fundamental presuppositions of ready-made angelic harmony assumed in the Western philosophical tradition of which Nietzsche is a constant</page><page sequence="17">Tragic Faith and the Dionysian Unconscious 115 critic, and this accounts for the seeming chaos of the plot of the novel. Unlike Schopenhauer, however, Baraka does not see this ceaselessly striving and suffering will as merely alternating between pain and boredom; instead, he sees it as transforming its basic agony through the mediation of the tragic spirit distilled in Dionysian mythogeny into patterns of life celebration and "higher equations of purpose." This is where Baraka's path crosses Nietzsche's and makes Baraka Nietzsche's seeming disciple. For Baraka and Nietzsche, the final goal of life is not attained through the abolition of the striving and suffering will, but through its tragic overcoming, the spirit of which is borne in the indefatigable soul of the Overman, or what Baraka cognitypically designates as the Peachesman. Baraka, through the mediation of the Dionysian imagination, proves ultimately to be Nietzsche's initiator of tragic culture. Like Nietzsche he sees with sharp clarity the deepest roots of black suffering and anonymity in racist America. With passionate concern, he searches for a way out of the moral dilemma that America poses. And he finds his escape neither in the noumenal illogic of a futuristic divine order nor in the presumed supremacy of the intelligence of man, homo sapiens, but rather in the phenomenal primacy of what Max Scheler calls home faber-a creature of instinctual drives and practical needs-in the depths of man's personality and his creative, self-affirming will to power, symbolized by the Bottom (dynatype) and embodied in the body scheme of Peaches (cognitype), the eternal feminine.4 Notes 'Pfeffer's book is the sole inspiration for this essay; and I hereby express my total, unqualified indebtedness. 2For a fuller discussion of the affinity between Buddhism and Nietzsche's thought, see Stambaugh 17-19. 3We are reminded of Nietzsche's early praise of Immanuel Kant's victory over the optimistic foundations of logic. Nietzsche paid the highest tribute to Kant when he called him "the initiator of a tragic culture." For more on this, read The Birth of Tragedy (1872). 4Dynatypes and cognitypes are two essential manifestations of the 6lan vital within the human psyche as identified by Ira Progoff. According to Progoff, dynatypes are the roots of the lifestyles to which we are attracted, in which we excel, and with which we find ourselves most easily content. Dynatypes program our vital energies. Cognitypes, on the other hand, release our vital energies. Cognitypes are the eternal verities through which the higher self in man is actualized.
