My motives are twofold. First, those works are interesting and provocative enough to point to larger reflections based on more historical information and put within an overall theoretical framework. Second, I wanted to show the huge bulk of cumulative and sometimes contrary research on which they are built, just as Newton was 'seated on the shoulders of giants'. Hence the amazing and tiresome, even for me, number of footnotes to document, and sometimes expand on the text. Instead of leaving the buildings in their state of elegant achievement once the scaffolding has been taken off, I have done quite the opposite and shown their blueprints, designs, material and tools used (plus some others). I have to thank most warmly the editorial board (and the copyeditor) for being so gracious and leaving me much more than the usual leeway. I wonder if any other journal would have ever done so. © The Authors 2010 .Journal compilation © 2010 Government and Opposition Ltd Published by Blackwell Publishing, 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main Street, Maiden, MA 02148, USA.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEW ARTICLES 209 The EU is a unique, treaty-based institutional framework that decides and manages economic and political cooperation among its . . . members.2 BACK TO BASICS: INSTITUTIONAL THEORY, POLITY AND NARRATIVES By way of reminder: I am pleading for an old-fashioned institutional theory of the EU, which is not the same as the trendier institutionalist theories. The latter proffer tentative explanations of the emergence and effects of a given set of institutional arrangements (following March and Olsen I would rather use 'organizational'), especially the compliance they elicit from their subjects. The former describes the working of institutions, and conjectures and assesses the logical and sociological coherence and comprehensibility of patterns of gover- nance and cooperation fit for a definite polity and the specific policy challenges it has to face. These patterns are not only systems of rules but also symbolic tools for building identities and inducing trust (they are sometimes called 'myths'). While an institutionalist theory describes and explains an ever-moving process,3 an institutional theory describes and explains how processes are designed and controlled and how they are related to purposes and outcomes. To use a metaphor, an institutionalist theory is like a movie where the final 'The End' barely appears, except in macro-sociological histories where it signals an epochal change when Minerva's owl flies off ('a form of life has had its day'); an institutional theory tries to freeze a frame. Institutionalist theory outlines broad inter-temporal margins; institutional theory tries its hand at drawing precise analytical borderlines.4 i 2 Raymond J.

In certain circumstances it speaks with - seemingly - one voice when a specific agent has to say some- method must be highlighted: A. Lijphart, Patterns of Democracy, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 1999; see a recent commentary: A. Vatter, 'Lijphart Expanded', European Political Science Review, 1: 1 (2009), pp. 125-54. I will not deal here with institutionalist theories of the EU, but a recent excellent example is L. Hoogue and G. Marks, 'A Post-functionalist Theory of European Integration: From Permanent Consensus to Constraining Dissensus', Bńtish Journal of Political Science, 39 (2008), pp. 1-23 (an interesting departure from the thesis that consensual institutional processes are functional since they are required by the process of integration). The distinction between the two types of theory is not made in the famous Hall and Taylor paper, P. Hall and R. Taylor, 'Political Science and the Three New Insti nationalisms', Political Studies, 44 (1996), pp. 936-57; nor in the title of the useful B. Guy Peters, Institutional Theory in Political Science: The ' New Institutionalism', London, Pinter, 1999; which leaves the reader in a state of uncertainty. It is true that rational-choice institutionalism (see O. Williamson, The Economic Institutions Capitalism, New York, Free Press, 1985; K. Shepsle, 'Studying Institutions: Some Lessons from the Rational Choice Approach', Journal of Theoretical Politics, 1: 2 (1989), pp. 131-47; D. North, Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1990; S. Bulmer, 'The New Governance of the European Union: A New Institutionalist Approach' , Journal of Public Policy, 13: 4 (1994), pp. 351-80; R. L. Calvert, 'The Rational Choice Theory of Social Institutions: Cooperation, Coordination, and Communica- tion', inj. S. Banks and E. A. Hanushek (eds), Modern Political Economy, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 218ff) is both institutional and institutionalist since it aims to explain the emergence of institutions providing public goods or compliance in the absence of institutions (the 'heuristic of trust': J. T. Scholz, 'Con- tractual Compliance and the Federal Income Tax System' , Journal of Law and Policy, 13 (2003), pp. 139-203), while describing and prescribing an institutional design (see the critical position of Robert Goodin, The Theory of Institutional Design, Cambridge, Cam- bridge University Press, 1996). Having said that, I have to admit that the rational- choice and evolutionary institutionalists are consistent in their reasoning. I am still puzzled by the tendency of sociological institutionalists with strong social-constructivist leanings to consider institutions as quasi-material internal elements to the individual actors whose preferences are thus structured by their institutional position, and yet they neglect the institutional analysis itself. The explanation is that social constructiv- ists (whose canon is W. Powell and P. Di Maggio (eds), The New Institutionalism in Organizational Analysis, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1991) and most of the historical institutionalists, in contrast to rational-choice institutionalists, do not con- sider the possibility of institutional choices (see T. A. Kolbe, 'The New Institutionalism in Political Science and Sociology', Comparative Politics, 2 (1995), p. 239; and the excellent M. Aspinwall and G.

This is the case for the presidents of the Council and the Commission, sometimes for the president of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the commissioners - at the risk of being taken to task by a member state. It is seldom the case for the presidents of the Parliament and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) , for obvious reasons that are valid at the national level as well. In other circumstances a tepid declaration is issued or a splendid cacophony fills the air. We cannot systematically manage the lan- guage mix of European politics (to the extent that we tend to deny the relevance of the distinction between domestic and international politics) . This makes the intertwining of substantive policy and insti- tutional issues (the linkage is widespread in many polities; compari- son with the United States is fruitful) all the more difficult to apprehend and assess, since the two types of issue are often phrased in both languages that the ECJ sometimes tries to combine to promote a federal view in the name of equality between member states in domains that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the EU (e.g. in matters of higher education: Commission versus Austńa , 2005) or are expressly reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the member states (e.g. in matters of regulation of labour relations: Laval versus européenne', in M. Delori, D. Deschaux-Beaume and S. Saurugger (eds), Le choix rationnel en science politique. Débats critiques, Rennes, Presses Universitaires de Rennes, 2009, p. 113), which may well be an uncritical extension of the 'path dependency' thesis (R. Rose, 'Inheritance Before Choice in Public Policy', Journal of Theoretical Politics , 2: 3 (1990), pp. 263-91. Does that rule out any interest in choice? I am sure Rose thinks not). Such a shortcoming, leaving nothing to say about change, as we have argued in Part I of this article, may be related to the lack of precision in the definition of institutions (see H. Keman, 'Approaches to the Study of Institutions', in B. Steunen- berg and E. Van Vught (eds), Political Institutions and Public Policy, Dordrecht, Kluwer, 1997, pp. 1-27). In homage to a recent Nobel Prize in Economics granted to a political scientist I would rather recall a theory both institutional and institutionalist that takes seriously the biologist Garret Hardin's authoritarian solution to 'the tragedy of the Commons' and explains how common goods are managed in the absence of a state and how institutional arrangements structure situational decisions outside the market model: L. Kiser and E. Ostrom, 'The Three Worlds of Action: A Metatheoretical Synthesis of Institutional Approaches', in E. Ostrom (ed.), Strategies of Political Inquiry, London, Sage, 1982, pp. 179-222; E.

The 2005 ruling favoured a 'welfarisť view whereas the 2007 ruling favoured liberal economics) .5 The outcome is that in the current state of EU studies we can stress exclusively the need for an institutional system with new rules of representation and decision-making, sometimes made up of isomor- phic organizations (the lawyers speak of 'structural congruence'), as if every policy sector should be governed by the same institutional setting,6 which is not even the case in the most centralized nation states themselves. Alternatively, we can stress the variation in policy- making - even within a single 'pillar' - without taking into account the need for a modicum of coordination between sectors, conveyed by the concept of 'regime'. Simon Hix seems to think that such a coordination, necessary to the rise of a politics of 'political' choices, does not need deep institutional changes, yet the behavioural and organizational reforms he advocates (e.g. on p. 186) are expected to bring about a renewed institutional regime. In this respect, his theory is genuinely institutional, as are Zielonka's and Colomer's, whose visions of a European polity are widely at variance with Hix's own 5 On the second case, see N. Reich, 'Free Movement versus Social Rights in Enlarged Union. The Laval and Viking Cases Before the ECJ', German Law Journal, 9: 2 (2008), pp. 125-61. The Laval ruling states that the Swedish labour law cannot auto- matically apply to a member state corporation operating in Sweden since it would be a violation of the European law (see on the overall problem, V. W. Kerber, 'Interjuris- dictional Competition within the European Union', Fordham International Law Journal, 23 (2000), p. 217). To say that the ECJ has a federal agenda dictated by the law it has to interpret and related to its institutional nature of 'Supreme Court' does not mean that it ignores the reactions of the member states and does not anticipate their decisions: in this respect the ECJ is a 'political actor' and its decision-making process may be the object of a 'strategic interpretation' (G. Garrett, 'International Cooperation and Insti- tutional Choice: The European Community Internal Market', International Organiza- tion, 46: 2 (1992) , pp. 533-60) . But it is a political actor using a legal language under its linguistic constraints (see the critical comments of A.-M. Slaughter and W. Mattli, 'Law and Politics in the European Union: A Reply to Garrett', International Organization, 48 (1994), pp. 183-90; and G. Garrett's rejoinder, 'The Politics of Legal Integration in the European Union', International Organization, 48 (1994), pp. 171-81). The same could be said of the federal input of the Commission and the Central Bank: they pursue political strategies using (and constrained by) a technical-legal language and a technical-economic language. Here historical and rational-choice insti tu tionalists may help each other to understand the processes. 6 On the use of institutional isomorphism to explain compliance with ambiguous rules, see P.

As I have been taken to task by readers of the first part of this review for not defining what I mean by a 'polity', let me begin with a crude tentative definition. Political theory has to do with polities, what Raymond Aron called 'pre-eminently political aggregates' (' agrégats politiques par excellence) such as cities, principalities, kingdoms, empires and states7 and with systems of polities. These systems of polities might be 'international' systems governed by the blanket concepts of war, opposing parties that distrust one another and rely first and foremost on self-help and the claim to be legally 'waterproof to one another,8 or they might be part of a foedus that binds parties 7 Raymond Aron, 'A propos de la théorie politique', in Raymond Aron, Etudes politiques , Paris, Gallimard, 1972. 8 The most extreme exponent of this view is obviously Carl Schmitt, whose use of the adjective 'waterproof can be found in his Theory of the Constitution (quoted by Olivier Beaud, Théorie de la fédération , Paris, PUF, 2007, p. 301). In its most extreme version, the 'war model' is related to a gloomy vision of human relations as an endless succession and repetition of modes of destruction, documented by scholars who do not openly share such a dire outlook (e.g. Ben Kiernan, Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 2007). A more balanced view is taken by the various brands of 'realists'. Despite the wealth of the recent literature on international relations in the last 20 years, too immense to be even recorded, I still think that over the last 60 years Hans Morgenthau, Raymond Aron, Hedley Bull, Stanley Hoffmann, Kenneth Waltz, Barry Buzan, John Mearsheimer, Stephen Walt and Edward Luttwak are still the leading exponents of such a view, whatever their huge differences; Aron, Bull, Buzan, above all Hoffmann, and even Morgenthau are the most prudent in their approaches. In the books under review, only Niall Ferguson fits squarely with the 'war model'. The other three either choose the second model or do not take sides. They tend to belittle or dismiss the difference between the language of a polity and the language of a system of polities. Zielonka, having dealt earlier and elsewhere with European foreign policy and its 'paradoxes', returns to the topic under the umbrella of his concept of empire. That relative neglect is also the reason why I do not mention the 'balance of power' view, which is a sort of compromise between the 'war' and the foedus models. Although the idea is today squarely and excessively rejected when used to describe the relations within the EU modelled on the ' Concert européen (Edward Gulick, Europe's Balance of Power , New York, Cornell University Press, 1955; L. Dehio, The Precarious Balance: The Politics of Power in Europe , 1494-1 945 , London, Chatto and Windus, 1963) , it should not be dismissed too easily given its long-term history and its current relevance, at least at the global level (Stanley Hoffmann, Primacy or World Order, New York, Auckland, 1978; R. Little, Balance of Power, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007). © The Authors 2010.

In modern times, the foedus dates back to Grotius and the Enlightenment and has gained strength with the recent transformations of the concept of state, becoming a 'market state', a 'trading state' and even a 'virtual state', due to the changing nature of the resources necessary to its existence and the supply and demand for new collective goods that the territorial Westphalian state is no longer able to provide. This leads to the concept of a state deregulating massively, or regulating wisely, leaving much room for private initiatives and local autono- mies; this is one of the core arguments that Josep Colomer shares with the lawyer Philip Bobbitt, without drawing the same interna- tional conclusions at all, as we will see below. More basically, the foedus view holds that relations between polities need not be governed by the 'state of war' (meaning that war is always possible as the only way to bring about peace, to quote the provocative Edward Luttwak's Virtual Empire) , since the opposite view taken in 1917 by Colonel Gatti after Caporetto is the motto of our times: 'It is idiotic to imagine that war can be a means of healing.' As with every motto, this one is far from being implemented, and Barack Obama's argument in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech restoring the notions of 'war of neces- sity' and 'just war' may look closer to facts, yet as a matter of principle it is the only available discourse, which leads us to hold that the autonomy of polities can exist alongside their well-organized coop- eration (as President Obama told his Oslo audience, 'we can under- stand that there will be war and still strive for peace'), hence the logical continuum from alliance to federation.9 The alliance, even 9 William Riker, 'Federalism', in Fred Greenstein and Nelson Polsby (eds), Hand- book of Political Science, New York, Addison Wesley, 1975; W. Riker, Federalism: Origin, Operation, Significance, Boston, Little, Brown, 1964. What is really fascinating is that such a view may be held by hard-nosed rational-choice individualists, Riker himself or Hayek (F. Hayek, The Economic Conditions of Interstate Federalism, 1938, reprinted in F. Hayek, Individualism and Economic Order, London, Rouledge, 1948), as well as by people holding an opposite sociological view, for example the economist François Perroux, cited below, the influential French lawyer of the 1930s and 1940s Georges Scelle, (Georges Scelle, Précis de droit des gens, Paris, Sirey, 1932, reprinted by C.N.R.S, 1981, pp. 187-287; Georges Scelle, Le fédéralisme européen et ses difficultés politiques, Nancy, Centre européen, 1952) and the equally influential Paul Reuter. Reuter's role next to Jean Monnet in the implementation of the 'Déclaration Schuman' should not be overlooked (Paul Reuter and Jean Combacau, Institutions et relations internationales, Paris, PUF, 1985, p. 289). © The Authors 2010.

Basically, a polity is not merely a set of elites, processes, cultures, public policies or tech- niques of administration, although almost any polity may of course be described with these toolboxes - terms also utilizable to describe any kind of organization, from a guild or a religious order to a corpora- tion, an union or an international organization where 'political activi- ties' take place, 'rule-making', 'measure-taking', 'dispute-settling', 'party-politics'.11 A polity is first the corporate organization of a set of collective choices binding parties whose membership is not revocable unless secession is permitted by a special provision,12 and who cannot legitimately resort to a type of physical violence forbidden by the accepted division of political labour (which does not cover all types of violence). The members (that is, the individuals) cannot be 'sover- eign', they cannot be the supreme judges of the value of their own interests, material or symbolic, including their own lives. They are de 10 Although this can be logically proved by rational-choice approaches, I prefer to recommend a superb illustration drawn from the analysis of British-American relations in the Second World War by a scholar deeply committed to the 'special relationship': Andrew Roberts, Masters and Commanders: How Four Titans Won the War in the West, New York, Harper, 2008. We should not be misled into thinking that this is one more 'heroic' piece of history. Was it a case of what the Lisbon Treaty calls a 'sincere cooperation'? 11 Carl Friedrich, Man and his Government. An Empirical Theory of Politics , New York, McGraw Hill, 1963; S. N.

Although I agree with Wolker Balli about the need to take seriously concepts such as 'constitutive for the European polity' (a much-needed and easily neglected statement), I do not think his definition of a polity as 'a configu- ration of agreements to collectively address common problems' is precise enough, being too close to the 'Guidebook' issued by the Commission and quoted as an epigraph to my text (W. Balli, 'Power and Gestalt of Political Concepts.

Second, no specific domain is ascribed to a polity by an organization of a higher order and it may pursue as many, or as few, substantial finalities as conceiv- able. It is precisely this ever-present and threatening capability that explains the many attempts made at submitting a polity to a higher order (usually religious but also what Hans Kelsen called a 'super order', legal for Kelsen but it may be also moral or economic), circumscribing its 'proper domain'13 and dividing its organization into mutually countervailing powers. This is where domestic federal- ism comes in as a sophisticated way to ascertain and guarantee the right of individuals not to obey anyone who would set forth a decree of nature to justify his commands.14 1 am aware that I am presenting 13 This is the meaning of the liberal tradition represented by Humboldt, for example. I recognize that the libertarian movement, sometimes rejoined by its sym- metrical enemy advocating a god-given politico-religious order, holds the reverse view. Only the interactions of individuals or believers have no specific domain ascribed to them, and the polity, being a derivative entity (and concept), is from the very begin- ning something to which some domain should be attributed by the pre-political social arrangements. It remains that nowadays this anti-Aristotelian view can only be imple- mented by the operation of agents recognized by a polity, unless those agents are opposed by a rival polity or a 'quasi' or 'anti' polity (see below note 15) in the cases of collapsed states such as Somalia, among others. 14 Larry Siedentop, Democracy in Europe , London, Allen Lane, 2000.

The crux of the matter is that Beaud stays resolutely away from the Hobbesian narrative basing a monolithic concept of sovereignty on individualism and that he does not construe federalism from the point of view of the individual to whom the Federation would grant © The Authors 2010.

By those standards, many - but not all - empires are much 'thinner' polities. This is precisely the point: a polity is also, third, the 'assertion of an overall collective identity',15 the taken-for-granted answer to a global question 'who are we?' disaggregated into 'where do we come from?' (genealogy), 'where are we going?' (teleology), 'who are our part- ners?' (commerce) and 'who are our enemies?' (polemics, too easily deconstructed today through the trick of the ubiquitous 'discursive construction of the enemy'16). These questions are complemented by more rights (ibid., p. 198). For these very reasons, he sees no logical discontinuity between 'interstate' and 'intrastate' federalism, a point that an institutional theory of the EU could, and should, emphasize. But it does not follow that Beaud dismisses the necessity of a federal state in a Federation, a point that the 'new federalists' such as Kalypso Nicolaïdis are all too willing to miss (see K. Nicolaïdis and R. Howse (eds), The Federal Vision. Legitimacy and Levels of Government in the European Union, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001, and below). In my opinion, Olivier Beaud's work is the best institutional theory of federation available, with Christoph Schönberger, Unionbürger. Europas federales Burgerrecht in vergleischender Sicht, Tübingen, Mohr, 2005; and Christoph Schönberger, 'European Citizenship as Federal Citizenship. Some Citizenship Lessons of Contemporary Federalism', European Review of Public Law, 19: 1 (2007), pp. 61-82. 15 Can non-territorial polities exist such as the 'dissenting' nomadic tribes that do not pay taxes to the nominal ruler? If those tribes are sedentary they have actually a territory and if they are not they carry their territory with them like a tortoise its shell or a ship its nationality. There may be 'quasi-polities', either legitimate (the religious order of the Knights Templars until Philip IV of France destroyed them) or illegitimate such as some types of mafias and groups of outlaws. The issues here are: 'is there a genuine rule of law in these would be polities?' and 'do they pursue a more general end besides making money?' The international networks of organized crime are more anti-polities than genuine polities, even though Charles Tilly's analogy between state- making and organized crime holds some value and some states are so deeply pen- etrated that the idea of 'mafia state' has been ventured.

Those assertions of a 'political community' are embedded in grand narratives.

The political feature of a narrative only emphasizes the corporate and organic aspect of a polity, even when it is not directly based on blood ties - a feature that may be explained in terms of rational choices, or alternatively required func- tions, but cannot be felt as a mere outcome of self-interested (possibly unconscious) calculation and games or of impersonal processes short of losing its credibility as a source of commitments. (2) More trouble- some is the fact that this article is in some respects a third-order construction based on second-order ones that utilize (sometimes, not always) sources based on primary documents (first-order construc- tions) . I have to concede that my narratives are not based on opinions and folk knowledge. Most of the European citizens do not know, and do not care for, the story of past European polities (except the states, their recent wars and their current protective duties), despite the European officials' hard work at persuading them that such a story does exist.17 But this is exactly what happened to the national (and other) threat. If that were not the case, the ruler would have no interest in such a move since it would be an irrational miscalculation - great cost and uncertain benefit. 17 For a study of the officials' efforts, see Chris Shore, Building Europe.

Among the main differences are weak salience of the European issue, ignorance of the remote past and presence of the post-colonial issue. The only surveys that might be relevant to the construction of European narratives would concern the intellectual elites and the officials (e.g. © The Authors 2010.

As Habermas (quoted in the first part of this article) has pointed out, a narrative is always a top-down process that runs the risk of not being accepted by a fractious audience, since, as Paul Ricoeur has put it, a narrative 4s meaningful to the extent that it portrays the features of temporal experience'.18 The outcome of the interplay between the experience of living and narrative is often problematic;19 all the theories of legitimacy are at great pains to deal with the issue. I am trying to sort out narratives for two reasons: they are present in the books I am commenting upon, and any viable institutional theory (I am tempted to add, 'any theory', even the most 'scientific') is more or less explicitly based on a narrative. Yet I am not drawing the authoritative conclusion that one of the narratives is going to succeed. Both of them may fail. My stubborn contention is that only those two stories may give rise to a coherent European polity. The following paragraphs are devoted to developing these points. Current conventional wisdom holds that there is no longer any room for monolithic grand narratives whose function was to impose their R. Wodak, 'National and Transnational Identities. European and Other Identities Constructed in Interviews with EU Officials', in R. K. Harmann, T. Risse and M. B. Brewer (eds), Becoming European in the EU, Oxford, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004), but the results might be rather conventional since it is well documented that the internal- ization of the EU's rules influences the civil servants' actions (J. Peterson and E. Bömberg, Decision Making in the European Union , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan, 1999). The thesis of 'epistemic professionalism' is not very fruitful in that case, but it may be useful to account for differences in how things are done in various member states, one of Zielonka's more powerful arguments, as we will see below. 18 Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative , vol. 1, Chicago and London, University of Chicago Press, 1984, pp. 3 and 64-70. On the epistemological status of narratives, see Shaul R. Shenshaw, 'Political Narratives and Political Reality', International Political Science Review, 27: 3 (2006), pp. 245-62 (a resolutely anti-relativist stance). 19 See the thoughtful remarks of the historian Edmund Morgan about the 'make- believe' notions enabling, in Hume's terms, the governors who have nothing to support them but opinion (a Machiavellian insight that struck Napoleon Bonaparte like a flash of lightning) to achieve 'the wonder of governance' through which so many should willingly submit to being ruled by the few. Morgan takes as a relevant example the Madisonian fiction of 'popular sovereignty' complemented at Philadelphia by 'the American people'. But the fiction was sufficiently close to fact to allow a suspension of disbelief and so Madison's invention worked (E. Morgan, 'The Founding Fathers' Problem: Representation', in E. Morgan, American Heroes: Profiles of Men and Women Who Shaped Early America, New York, Norton, 2008).

Today's reality, being much larger and vastly more fractured, would be unlikely to give rise to these modern visions (to wit the Enlightenment and 'the white man's burden') through which a genius, whether political or artistic, would present himself as an example to the whole of human- kind. In this would lie the reason for the decline of great composers: Elliott Carter is not Ludwig van Beethoven or even Piotr Illich Tchaik- ovsky; Luciano Berio's 'Symphony' is to a world of (not necessarily conflicting) 'collage' what Haydn's 'London Symphonies' were to a world of (conflicting) systemic orders. This view is mistaken: an aesthetic narrative does not always perform the same functions as a political one unless one decides that both are part and parcel of the same meta-narrative (which is just a narrative among others). More important, such a grand narrative is precisely what the EU proposes to the rest of the world for such matters as human rights, free trade, climate change and peace-building (this is the heart of Jan Zielonka's argument but Jacques Delors, far from his institutional views, shares the same vision, as do Jurgen Habermas, Peter Sloterdjick and a myriad of intellectual European elites of various persuasions, with a few conspicuous exceptions - Perry Anderson and perhaps Axel Honneth among them) . The European narrative envisions quality of life, sustainability, peace and harmony;20 its five key concepts are human rights, democracy, diversity, prosperity and security.21 A grand narrative need not be 'imperialist' in the usual sense - imposed by the sheer force of conquering armies or technological, economical and ideological weapons. It may be pluralist, tolerant, multiculturalist 20 J. Rifkin, The European Dream: How Europe's Vision of the Future is Quietly Eclipsing the American Dream, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2004.

Fabbrini is to be believed, the USA and Europe are becoming similar (S. Fabbrini, Compound Democracies. Why the United States and Europe Are Becoming Similar, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007) but, for Rifkin and Leonard, they have quite different dreams. Sigmund Freud would have been delighted by the enigma. To use anthropomorphism when speaking of collectives may be hazardous. It is not, however, a sufficient reason to espouse a purely social constructivist view of the phenomenon (for example, F. Schimmelfennig, The EU, NATO and the Integration of Europe.

Nye's construction) that is nothing other than its attractiveness to the rest of the world entranced by its charms and struck with an intense sympathy to the particular polities supposed to embody that universal model of civilization. This is Western Europe's mania to present itself as a disgusting old man that has cast off all the sins it is still brooding over and has emerged as a young and wise prophet. Admittedly, some tough hardliners outside and sometimes inside the Western world deem this endeavour a form of cultural neo-imperialism even more pernicious than the clash of civilizations since it is a vicious attempt to win the clash by denying its existence, just as the Soviet Empire's 'hard-soft power' over the non-Tro tskyist communists throughout the world denied, until Tito and much later Mao, the existence of an enduring clash of nations. To sum up, a narrative may be identified as an authoritative 'story', an imaginary reconstruction of the past or of a historical trajectory utilized to convey a convincing description of what is going on now and a plausible prediction of what the future challenges might look like. Accordingly, it is bound to select relevant (to its authors) aspects of the past as well as of the future. Whether it is created in an official political framework (like the ones I am going to expound), or in a non-political context - albeit dealing with matters that the scientist may deem political in a broad sense - a narrative endows the world with meaning by locating the experience in time and place and 'moralizing the events'.22 The two narratives I have sorted out emphasize as pressing challenges economic globalization, global environmental issues and the needs for a global humanitarian rule of law, competitive growth and sus- tainable development, but they tend to ignore the demographic ordeal awaiting Europe as a result of its early and overextended transition to low birth and death rates compared with its southern neighbours' late and insufficient transition to the same state, which makes for a disproportionate high fertility and population growth (the exceptions are Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia and Iran). Although the overall European population will keep growing, Germany and, 22 H. White, 'The Value of Narrativi ty in the Representation of Reality', in W. J. T.

In Germany today around a quarter of the children are born to immigrant fami- lies and, unsurprisingly, they drop out of school at more than double the rate of 'native' Germans, a sound recipe for dangerous social cleavages since everywhere the evolution of the breakdown by age and ethnic groups will lead to drastic changes in the welfare regimes and Europe's social fabric. Zielonka pays some attention to the topic, but only in his strongly argued chapter on 'Economic Governance', to show that - despite some achievements - several European coun- tries suffer from the rigidity of their welfare systems, the failure of welfare reforms and the fact that 'the EU must increase its growth rate and improve its overall competitive position'. Those common- place views are wide of the mark; welfare reforms are on all the developed countries' agendas, not only because the population is ageing but also because the costs of health care grow faster than the economy, and the two phenomena are not quite connected. Suffice it to note, with the demographer Paul Demeny, that in 2005, for every 10 people in the 27 countries of the EU there were 14 people in the surrounding Arab countries, and if the current trend is extended by moderate projections the proportion will be 10 to 28 in 2050. The entire population of the Arab world is expected to grow by some 40 per cent over the next two decades, the equivalent of two new Egypts (153 million people), and in 2050 the EU-25 will reach 450 million and its southern and south-eastern neighbours will grow to perhaps 1.25 billion, and that in a region that already has the lowest employ- ment rate in the world, with about one out of five young people out of work, and where total manufacturing exports are below those of the Philippines or Israel. The only industry growing steadily is the manufacturing of political alienation and ideological resentment. None of the authors reviewed cites those widely known figures, which are ignored by the European circus, admittedly for good reasons (why should we assume that no change will occur in the labour market and in industrial production? Why should we ignore that the hostile attitudes towards certain immigrants are triggered by consistent 'group cues', emotionally convincing whatever their objec- tive validity?23) , but also because everyone is careful not to darken its 23 T.

Colomer seems to think the issue settled if self- government is transferred to small units without their own armies, borders and customs but with a strong cultural homogeneity allowing democracy to be effective. This would only move the problem down to local governments without solving it: how can a small borderless unit remain homogeneous unless it resorts to some unpleasant tech- niques of social control likely to be judged unlawful by the European courts? Little Botswana, one of the best governed and most prosper- ous African countries, has borders to protect the exceptional cultural homogeneity of its democratic polity. For his part, Zielonka does not neglect the consequences of the Arab and African imbalance on neighbouring Europe but he wisely refrains from depicting the EU as a besieged fortress analogous to Byzantium in the fifteenth century. His solution is to recommend that the governments give up their bad habit of showing an unwar- ranted and malignant distrust of the Muslim citizens, to forget or qualify traditional foreign and security problems and to export a model of good economic governance. He recommends this, as if the success of an economic and administrative model (supposing it might bring about immigrants' upward mobility, see the German case among others) were enough, together with the government's and officialdom's virtuous and tolerant attitudes, to transform people with legitimate grievances expressed in a nationalist, ethnic or reli- gious language into good liberal and loyal citizens of European Union. Most of them are willing to act in perfect good faith and to do their utmost for this purpose, provided they keep and deepen their core identity. While we do not know any dominant interpretation of the meaning and the range of that identity (it is likely that many Muslims do not feel more Muslim than the secular French or German Jews felt Jewish in the 1920s), or how many Muslims (a majority? a minority?) adhere to a strict interpretation of Islam and which one, it remains that the topic is hotly debated (and not only in the 'liberal' cal Science , 52: 4 (2008), pp. 959-76 (an excellent experimental research).

That value system is arguably best as a political order to the contemporary European public opinion (despite, or because of, its somewhat excessive cultural and moral permissiveness), with some residual resistance in Poland, Ireland and Italy, yet it is not universal by any 'scientific' or other standards.25 The issue is not new, nor is it that it encourages local-level clien- telist practices of politicians to conquer a safe immigrant constitu- ency, even in laïque , republican and Jacobin France. After all, those practices used to be and still are part and parcel of the healthy US democracy, threatened by other problems such as growing social inequalities, the culture war and, more importantly, the culture of war. The real issue, which should be recognized quite apart from any feeling of racism and Islamophobia, is that a significant number of Muslims in Europe have good reasons of their own to share the feelings of some of their radical cousins in the Arab and Muslim world and may be less hostile in 2010 to radical, or simply fundamen- talist, Islam than the East Europeans refugees were to communism in the 1950s and 1960s. Besides, they are under heavy external pressures exerted by radical missionaries. I will not expand on the topic, which is the subject of a mass of repetitive literature of poor and uneven 24 Admittedly, it is difficult to disentangle taken-for-granted social practices from the religious justifications offered as constitutive of those practices by their agents (even though other religious agents may distance themselves from them). This is particularly obvious in matters of 'honour killings', which permit the killing of women (and their guilty lovers) for breaking codes of sexual conduct, for example in Pakistan (despite a law passed in 2005 making honour killing a capital offence) and also among Pakistanis in Great Britain: see Tariq Ali, 'Diary', London Review of Books, 18 December 2008, p. 35, suitably introduced by a similar story that inspired Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel, Chronicle of a Death Foretold. Marquez blamed the socio-moral dicta- torship of the Catholic Church. In Dante's Inferno, the unfaithful Francesca da Rimini and her lover, both beheaded by an outraged husband, are well placed among the damned, nothing is said about the husband. 25 On the pro and con, see W.

The first is Paul Sniderman, Multiculturalism, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2006 (a study of the Netherlands that helps us to understand why in a country more culturally liberal and more critical of a rigorous position on law and order in the 1970s the parties have become by the 1990s the least culturally liberal of all the countries compared by H. Kriesi; see H. Entzinger, 'The Rise and Fall of Multiculturalism: The Case of the Netherlands', in C. Joppke and E. Morawska (eds) , Toward Assimilation and Citizenship: Immigrants in Liberal Nation States, New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, pp. 59-86). The second is Bassam Tibi, 'Euro- peanizing Islam or the Islamization of Europe: Political Democracy vs. Cultural Dif- ference', in Timothy Byrnes and Peter Katzenstein (eds), Religion in an Expanding Europe, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2006. The opposite stance, which feigns to believe that the only external pressures come from the liberal societies that want to constrain the Muslims to be secular liberals, is naively taken by (among many) J. Nielsen, 'The Question of Euro-Islam: Restrictions or Opportunity?', in A. Al-Azmeh and E. Fokas (eds), Islam in Europe. Diversity, Identity and Influence, Cambridge, Cam- bridge University Press, 2006, pp. 34-48; another type of polemic can be found in the second-hand yet professional enough article of A. Boukhars, 'Islam, Jihadism, and Depoliticization in France and Germany', International Political Science Review, 30: 3 (2009), pp. 297-317. Its main thesis is that 'demonization' of Islam is counter- productive and an obstacle to the definition of what is negotiable in the secular model of society. The argument seems well taken although, like many others, it follows the trendy path of feigning to ignore that such a definition has been provided time and again by serious scholars: among other fine examples see Patrick Weil, 'Why the French Laïcité is Liberal', Cardozo Law Review, 30: 6 (2009), pp. 2699-714, a robust rejoinder to the American multiculturalists' unwarranted attacks (J. W. Scott, J. Bowen and J. Carens). Moreover, Boukhars ignores the reverse question: why is the symmetric 'demonization' of non-Muslims in several Islamic countries productive? Let us note that in an article dealing inter alia with Germany Bassam Tibi, who teaches and publishes mosdy in German, is not even mentioned, which makes his work all the more commendable, as well as the whole Byrnes and Katzenstein book, which deals seriously with the problem of multiple modernities raised by Eisenstadt and Berger and Hun- tington (S. N. Eisenstadt, 'Multiple Modernities', Daedalus, 129: 1 (2002), pp. 1-29; P. Berger and S. Huntington (eds), Many Globalizations: Cultural Diversity in the Contempo- rary World, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002), a topic I will only address in passing. In any case, the heated and confusing debates about the vices and virtues of two models of integration (multicultural and republican, see below) strongly suggest that there is no more a European model in this matter than in matters of welfare, an argument that bothers hard-nosed federalists who ignore that it may be a blessing in © The Authors 2010.

Only comparativists such as Hanspeter Kriesi, to whom we will return later, pay growing attention to the story, at least in so far as it has some bearing on the dominant populations' prejudiced behaviours and attitudes and is in some ways related to the transfor- mation of the traditional cultural cleavage and the emergence of a new cleavage (not always linked to immigration): two phenomena caused by globalization. Narratives treat history as a whole as the 'grand theories' of 'big science' treat the evolutionary nature of physical reality. They are different from academic theories that aim to explain a mechanism or deconstruct a conventional wisdom based on the common sense of actors. Yet, even these theories are more often than not embedded in a theory, explicit or tacit, one of whose functions in the modern times has been to restructure political space to control and annul political time27 in order to tame the tidal wave of change. In the same way a constitution - both a higher law and a tool for political governance - is, according to Jon Elster remembering Rousseau, 'a way for the dead to tie the hands of the living' by providing the latter with rules and meaning. By the same token, it is possible to detect self-images in the workings and justifications of specific policies.28 Narratives are differ- disguise for the soft federalists, and suits the 'imperialists' who ignore that a modern ' democratic empire' may be in trouble when leaving both topics to the nation states' discretion. 27 John Gunnell, Political Theory. Tradition and Interpretation, Cambridge, MA, Win- throp, 1979. On political theory (pt), empirical, normative or prescriptive, as a subfield of academic political science, and Political Theory ( PT) as an interdisciplinary activity extending far beyond the limits of professional political science to comprehend phi- losophers, linguists, historians, memorialists, essayists, political (and other) agents trying to make sense of their practice, see John Gunnell, 'Political Theory. The Evolution of a Subfield', in Ada Finifter (ed.), Political Science. The State of the Discipline, Washington, DC, American Political Science Association, 1983. Thirty years on, I do not find these texts outmoded, though they claimed to signal the end of traditional Political Theory, now thriving in political science. It is probably because I am under the overwhelming impression, seemingly shared by Simon Hix, that political time has gone mad and so a genuine political theory (PT as well as pt) is more necessary than ever, provided it abides by the caveats mentioned in the first part of this article (this corollary statement is mine and Hix does not take a specific stance on that method- ological issue). 28 See Furio Cerutti and Sonia Lucarelli (eds) , The Search for a European Identity.

Yet, even those ideological and strategic justifications, however cynical or manipulative, make up, or are a blueprint of, one Zeitgeist (or more) , available at a given time to be used as a reservoir or toolbox of strategies that can be activated in different situations by social actors.29 Let us give an example of the use of narratives as toolboxes. Vivien Schmidt has aptly identified four types of discourse among the political rulers' different ways of responding to the dissat- isfaction of their peoples by improving their sense of empowerment and finding innovative EU solutions to their economic problems: 'pragmatic' (the EU as a borderless problem-solving entity ensuring free markets and regional security), 'normative' (the EU as a bor- dered value-based community) , 'principled' (the EU as a border-free, right-based, post-national union), and 'strategic' (the EU as a global actor pursuing a grand strategy by doing things differendy in international relations through multilateralism, humanitarian aid and peace-keeping30) . Those discourses are circumstantial rhetorical Furio Cerutti and Enno Rudolph (eds), A Soul for Europe, 2 vols, Leuven, Peters, 2001). There is some relation here to the discursive institutionalism advocated by Vivien Schmidt in her excellent critical review of institutionalist theories (Vivien Schmidt, 'The Explanatory Power of Ideas and Discourse', Annual Review of Political Science , 11 (2008), pp. 303-26), although those grand narratives are somewhat different from the specific public policy narratives described by Claudio Radaelli (C. Radaelli, 'Logiques de pouvoir et récits dans les politiques publiques de l'Union Européenne', Revue française de science politique, 50: 2 (2000), pp. 255-75). 29 Ann Swidler, 'Culture in Action: Symbols and Strategies', American Sociological Review, 52 (1986), pp. 273-86. 30 Vivien Schmidt, 'Re-Envisioning the European Union: Identity, Democracy, Economy', fournal of Common Market Studies, 47: Annual Review (2009), pp. 24-5. For an earlier study of discourses, see K. Joergensen (ed.), Reflective Approaches to European Governance, London, Macmillan, 1997. I am emphasizing here the difference between discourse and narrative but discourse may be used as a broader concept than narrative since, as a linguistic phenomenon, a narrative belongs to the discursive category (J. Wilson, 'Political Discourse', in D. Schiffrin, D. Tannen and H. E. Hamilton, The Handbook of Discourse Analysis, Oxford, Blackwell, 2001, pp. 398ff). On the last and least conceptualized but very widespread discourse mentioned by Schmidt, see J. Howorth, 'The Case for an EU Grand Strategy', Egmont Papers, 27 (2009), pp. 18-24. Edward Luttwak, specialist of the grand strategy of the Roman and Byzantine empires, would be horrified by such an extension of the term. Yet it is still possible to venture that a new type of empire needs a new type of grand strategy. © The Authors 2010.

We will show that the pragmatic and principled discourses draw on the imperial-clerical narrative, while the normative and stra- tegic discourses draw on the federal narrative. Of course, the discur- sive agencies may have (good) reasons of their own to deny the terms used here to describe the core narratives but that is entirely another matter: the scholars' political concepts are not the actors' politically and ideologically manipulated concepts. The former cannot be con- flated by scholars to form a new concept without solid logical argu- ments, whereas that is the usual fate of the latter when the sociopolitical context constrains the political agents to do so. Any political narrative is always in competition with other narra- tives. In Carl Schmitt' s terms a narrative is not political if it is not at war with another narrative, and Skinner has extended this polemical view, perhaps excessively, to 'the more abstract works of political theory' that 'are never above the battle, they are part of the battle itself.31 Accordingly, there is a sizeable number of European stories, each differing according to the local situations it stems from.32 For example, a continental story may be matched by a Europe of archi- pelagos (I owe the formula to John Pocock), or by a Europe where 31 Quentin Skinner, Hobbes and Republican Liberty, Cambridge, Cambridge Univer- sity Press, 2008. 32 As Juan Diez Medrano has observed, the European citizens' images of the EU and the European integration process are always filtered by national and subnational cultures (J. Diez Medrano, Framing Europe. Attitudes to European Integration in Germany , Spain and the United Kingdom, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2003, p. 249). See Justine Lacroix and Kalypso Nicolaïdis (eds), European Stories , Oxford, Oxford Univer- sity Press, forthcoming. Their study is limited to the 'EU stories'. It may happen that the process works in a reverse order, Europe being a reference point embedded in the constructions of national identities, as the social constructivists such as Ole Waever and Thomas Diez have argued (a familiar thesis long applied to the construction of national public policies, e.g. P. Muller, 'Entre le local et L'Europe. La crise du modèle français de politiques publiques', Revue française de science politique, 42: 2 (1992), pp. 275-97).

Incidentally, this would explain why Angela Merkel, who shares this overall vision of a protecting state, strongly disagrees on several issues (among others, the budget deficits and the eco- nomic government), not only because she is the guardian of the German national interest (which she is, of course), but also because she, as a former East German, holds another vision of the German past and therefore of its national identity. However, anecdotes are not arguments, and it would be foolish to explain away what some- body says by holding that, being who she is and given where she is located, she could not have spoken otherwise. Has not Angela Merkel recently abandoned, at least for a time, the dogma of 'no deficit'? her main theses is that compound national polities (a term coined after the compound republic in The Federalist, p. 39; see the authoritative Vincent Ostrom, The Political Theory of a Compound Republic: Designing the Ameńcan Experiment, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1987) with strong traditions of authority dispersal, as in Germany and Italy, fit better with the EU than simple polities with an ethos and structure of centralization, as in France and Great Britain. I cannot help thinking that beyond the German and Italian cases she has in mind the United States while dealing with her European region state as a federation in the making (although in her more recent text she seems to waver in her appraisal: Schmidt, 'Re-Envisioning the European Union'). I am not claiming that she makes a comparison by similarity between the EU and the USA. Actually she contrasts them and she does not dream of taking Mr Van Rumpuy and Lady Ashton for the new European George Washington and Thomas Jefferson who did not have to coexist with a 'rotating president' of the American governors. But she sees the EU through the lenses of her location as a citizen of the USA. A caveat: this is a truncated version of the USA, more a congressional government with its subtle party system combining a relatively moderate ideological struggle for the conquest of power posi- tions with a 'desideologization' of policy-making based on interests and consensus- seeking (I am not sure Schmidt is still right, given the recession of bipartisanship in the hottest issues today, religion and health care), than a presidential government with its elected king of a strong federal state. It is more a soft civilian power with social concerns than the hard imperial power described by Ferguson. It is likely that this USA is what Schmidt wishes her country to be and her EU a sort of imperfect USA. I am struck as an afterthought that her picture of the EU is a mix of Simon Hix's effort to set up what she calls 'more federal institutional relations' between the member states (p. 273) and Colomer's and Zielonka's remarks that the EU works if and only if it eschews ideological politics (once again, in Schmidt's recent article she seems to have partially changed her mind to come slightly closer to Simon Hix) . © The Authors 2010.

I could have included Vivien Schmidt, whose regional state comes close to a mixed federal vision of sorts. Admittedly, she has recently offered substantial policy prescriptions, of which only one implies an institutional innovation, but they are not based on an overall narrative of what a European polity might be.39 Her concept of regional state, designed to meet the challenge, does not do the job, precisely for a reason she gives herself: whereas empire is a normative conceptualization (like the supra-national state she also mentions), 'calling the EU a regional state reflects empirical reality'. This is a much-needed caveat against normative theories forgetful of the whole empirical reality, and I have highlighted this trap myself in the first 37 This is vindicated by the empirical measures and explanations of the distribution of opinions legitimizing the EĻJ among the European citizenry, for example Sophie Duchesne, 'Waiting for European Identity.

Frognier, 'National and European Identification. A Dual Relationship', Comparative European Politics, 6 (2008), pp. 143-68. 38 Following Michael Oakeshott, I am merely transposing the Aristotelian figure of the theoros/bios theoretikos from a world where politics is a matter of art and ethics, and history is just a reservoir of examples regardless of the stages of historical development when they occur, to a world where historicism reigns while politics may be also, at least partially, an object of hard science. Michael Oakeshott's subtle and critical reflections are still well worth reading for his apology of conversation against management and institutional engineering (two necessary tools today), his distinction between religious and civil association and his emphasis on universitas and societas , useful to deepen our understanding of the European past and present.

Yet, there may be normative theories immune to such a widespread disease and, besides and above all, a grand narrative - being symbolic, and a genuine symbol is not the figment of an irrational imagination - is always more or less normative since it gives meaning and value to empirical reality, so contributing to its making and finally reflecting it if and only if it achieves the status of grand narrative , a well-grounded illusion. This is precisely what the concept of regional state cannot do because it simply reflects (with a somewhat inappropriate use of the term 'state') a European empirical reality that comes to us in disjointed bits and pieces. The ' regional state ' , Schmidt tells us, ' reflects state quality in certain domains' (European Monetary Union (EMU), ECB, ECJ, competitive policy) while in many other domains it is the province of differentiated participation, variable boundaries and so on. To put it bluntly, the regional state is the place where the language mix triumphs and a grand narrative should leave no room for a language mix. If it does so it calls for a new and convincing language that will transform the former language's mixed nature into a new vision of empirical reality, just as a new paradigm or grand theory reduces the former paradigm's enigma to a new all-encompassing paradigm. This is not the case at the moment and it is perhaps a sufficiently pragmatic reason for holding that every attempt at departing from this polycentric polity and advo- cating a liberal intergovernmentalism or its opposite - an idealistic federalism - would weaken its legitimacy.40 Why not? In the meantime, that wise and candid position should not keep us from depicting the messy structure in a non-messy language. For example, a mixed government, whether it means a distribution of power between class or status-based organs (the pre-modern meaning) or a combination of 'pure' regimes conducive to a separation of functions (presidential leadership, parliamentary legislation, autonomous judiciary)41 that the French pluralists name a régime mixte , is not just a regime of 40 R. Bellamy and D. Castiglione, 'Legitimizing Euro-"Polity" and its "Regime" European Journal of Political Theory, 2: 1 (2003), pp. 7-34. 41 On the difference between a mixed government and the classical separation of powers related to the regime mixte, see Maurice Vile, Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers, Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, 1998. We will return to that important difference later. I thank Christopher Bickerton for emphasizing it to my benefit (C. Bickerton, 'Europe's Neo-Madisonians.

As an empirical concept the region state may well be a conceptual innovation, admittedly better than its earlier relative, multilevel governance.44 Yet the single state- ment that the EU should not be modelled on the nation state - which is just a negative conceptual prescription born of an uncontroversial empirical observation (a nation state made up of resilient fully fledged nation states is a rarity; even a successful military conquest does not easily achieve this goal) - must not lead its author to venture a bold theory of a post-state or non-state federalism, or better, a hybrid customized federalism produced by an evolutionary pragmatism and based on the (once again uncontroversial) empirical observation that 42 Nobody has questioned for a long time the simple reality of the growing trend towards power-sharing in the EU (G. Garrett and G. Tsebelis, 'An Institutional Critique of Intergovernmentalism', International Organization, 50: 2 (1996), pp. 269-99). 43 This is where I differ with an otherwise very good work in European constitu- tional legal theory, Sébastien Roland, Le triangle décisionnel à Vanne de la théorie de la séparation des pouvoirs. Recherches sur la distribution des pouvoirs législatif et exécutif dans la Communauté, Brussels, Bruylant, 2008. To be more specific, practising a language mix is not at all the same as having within a single polity 'a variety of governing institu- tions . . . based on . . . divergent constitutional conceptions' (A. King, The British Con- stitution, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 352). Nor is it the use of ambiguity within a single language: ambiguity is a basic property of most of the natural languages since it may be useful for defusing conflict by casting a 'veil of vagueness' on social arrangements (D. Gibson and R. Goodin, 'The Veil of Vagueness: A Model of Institutional Design', in M. Egenberg and P. Laegreid (eds), Organizing Political Institutions:. Essays for Johan P. Olsen, Oslo, Scandinavian University Press, 1999, pp. 357- 85; J. Erk andJ.-L. Gagnon, 'Constitutional Ambiguity and Federal Trust: The Codification of Federalism in Belgium, Canada and Spain', Regional and Federal Studies, 10: 1 (2000), pp. 92-111). If one puts together the language of international organi- zations (which are systems of polities) and the language of domestic institutions, that will suffice as long as one is trying to describe and explain some empirical arrange- ments born of the pragmatism of practical politics but not if one tries to offer such a description as an institutional feature of a polity, for example in taking Madison's compound republic for a theory of the EU as it is today. 44 Besides the references in the first part of this article, see B.

Moravcsik's and Menon's outstanding works do not quite fit in the picture, at least in my opinion, since they are first and foremost explanatory and demystifying narratives of a system of polities in a state of relative equilibrium. When they make a theoretical move these narratives defend the democratic legitimacy of the EU by arguing, as Moravcsik does, that the modes of delegation to the ECJ, ECB and other autonomous authorities are consistent with the late twentieth-century practice of most advanced industrial countries.46 This argument overlooks on purpose the obvious difference from the EU: to wit the EU has no responsible government. More logically, their description and justification of the EU could apply to an inter- national organization as well: it 'empowers states by limiting them', it supplies functional benefits by doing things that the states are no longer able to do, it enhances legitimacy by embedding within national political and administrative systems legally enforceable obli- gations to respect the interests of actors whose voice is excluded or muffled {de jure or de facto) within purely national processes.47 We could add that it may induce the member states to a reciprocal modification of their national interests.48 That is the spitting image of an international organization that works and so improves the demo- 45 K.

My interpretation may be wrong, but it looks fairly certain that Moravcsik and Menon waste no time caring for an institutional design and are focusing on the explanation of the actual working of a consensus-based messy system where the only coherent institutional innovations are the arrangements for the single market and mon- etary policy. Anand Menon, from whom I borrow the latter assess- ment, has a lot of sensible things to say in describing and explaining why the European Parliament is both highly effective in its capacity as law-maker and widely perceived as irrelevant in the EU polity, yet he does not feel the need to go further, given what the European national governments and other organizations and groups are and how they behave. Once again, why not? After all, should we not avoid the trap of nominalism and be satisfied with the current name or its equivalent - a Union of States (note that the term 'state' is carefully avoided in the Commission guidebook quoted earlier)? He may be quite right and what I am going to present may be nothing more than 49 Compare these justifications of the EU to the argument for multilateralism made by R. Keohane, S. Macedo and A. Moravcsik, 'Democracy Enhancing Multilateralism', International Organization , 63 (2008), pp. 1-31: multilateralism combats special inter- ests, protects individual and minority rights and improves the quality of public delib- eration.

TWO MASTER NARRATIVES - PRELIMINARIES I have no intention of following here the familiar opposition between, on the one hand, a nomos of the earth, a Federation with a definite territory, and, on the other hand a cosmopolitan norm, a potentially universal empire, or even the Kantian 'league for per- petual peace', universalistic but not imperial. This is despite their obvious relevance in many philosophical and empirical debates in bygone and present days (we could oppose Madison to Kant, chro- nologically and logically53) and several imperial theses' bias in favour of the norm. Both narratives have their particularistic and universal- istic sides. They may advocate in various proportions both exclusion- ary and universalistic norms,54 the adamant nationalists being, in the present process of globalization, the only ones likely to rely on exclu- sionary norms at the national (distinct from European) level, all the more so if they feel they are the losers in the process. Both narratives admit that a European model based around open borders, free trade and consolidated welfare systems may have some difficulty in being viable, all the more so when the 2008-9 crisis has exposed such issues as how to marry a European cross-border single market for finance with the reality that only national governments can and will step in when things go wrong.55 52 W.

They may even concede (unwill- ingly on the part of the federalists) that national boundaries may be, paradoxically, rendered more salient by the new features of politics, and so bring about a demand for exclusionary measures.56 Kriesi and his co-authors rightly take it for granted that the process of denationalization is of an unprecedented magnitude and that the new patterns of globalization display unparalleled qualitative differences surpassing the earlier epochs' patterns.57 We should be careful to note, however, that globalization has not the same mag- nitude everywhere: Africa, so important to Europe given its geo- graphical and historical proximity to the southern part of the EU, is more an outcast than an integral part of the process. Staying on the margins, it has been less affected by the 2008-9 crisis but has suffered from the withering away of foreign direct investments, the decrease in exports and remittances of expatriates, which is likely to speed up the migrations of the poorest people.

Physical distance remains a causal factor alongside topological distance (the presence of other coun- tries between two countries), gravitational distance (the rise or decline of influence according to the mass and proximity of a country) and - the only non-geographical distance - attributional distance (the affinities between cultural and political regimes).58 It is true nevertheless that, from a European standpoint, both narratives recognize globalization's universal effects and the conclu- sions drawn from that fact about the universalistic (or not) features of the European polity cannot be used as a watershed between them. As we have seen in the first part of this article, Jurgen Habermas is both federalist and cosmopolitan, as were Arnold Toynbee, Aldous Huxley and Bertrand Russell in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, and above all Alexandre Koj ève, whose vison of the end of history included a 'universal and homogeneous state' in the mak- ing.59 For his part Zielonka seems to think of a borderless empire while Colomer holds that one empire stops where another empire begins. We will see later that this seemingly small difference will become a huge gap between their conceptions. For the time being their agreement is limited to the notion of flexible, moving and functionally differentiated imperial borders and to a resolute discon- nection of 'nation' from 'nation state' (Westphalian). There is nothing inherently contradictory in the imperial cosmopolitan vision, despite its seemingly oxymoronic (for the non-connoisseur) flavour when it has become fashionable to oppose cosmopolis to impe- ńum.60 For its part, the federal narrative may also aim either at a world 58 A.

See the linguistic embarrassment of Anne-Marie Slaughter in her widely praised book, Anne-Marie Slaughter, A New World Order, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2004: most of the reluctance to revive the federal topic is due to the misgivings about the idea of a 'world government' liable to be a top-down tyranny in a dystopia (Michael Walzer, Arguing About War, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 2004, pp. 171-91; Richard Falk, Achieving Human Rights, London, Routledge, 2009, pp. 11-24. Hence the shift to the less offensive and more horizontal 'governance' and sometimes the use of 'government' for 'governance'.

The imperial narrative is decidedly against a sovereign Westphalian European state and shows more leniency to the residual sovereignty of the member states, although it also holds that even at this level sovereignty is actually shared and divided (some federalists would not disagree). The federal narrative is suspected of sticking to a Westpha- lian sovereignty at the European level while denying it at the national level, which is only partially true. The founding fathers (Schuman, Gasperi, Spaak, Hallstein, but not Monnet) probably shared such an outlook, but that is no longer the case, given the conceptual stretch- ing to which the unfortunate term is submitted by some would-be federalists. Actually, no sharp dividing line can be drawn between the two narratives. Both of them encompass variegated views, from the purposeful ignorance of the meaning of the concept to evade the issue of an European democracy's institutional consistency, to an utter rejection of its utility for the issues at hand.63 An additional note on sovereignty is therefore needed: it is defi- nitely not a descriptive sociological concept that would be empty for want of any empirical illustrative case: nobody in the real world rules supremely for more than a few instants to do whatever he wants (Caligula, as emperor, was not sovereign, he was just mad). It is a stipulative juridical concept, a necessary fiction expressing a claim (which has to be justified and vindicated) utilized by the agents as a ritual to put their house in order and carry through political battles inside and outside. In this context, the famous image of 'organized hypocrisy'64 should be seriously qualified since it cannot be taken for a falsification of the concept, the difficulty being not in truly believing it 62 W.

Neither is it a problem to renounce or infringe the principle at times while claiming it always reigns (any legal norm is in that uncomfortable situation), provided too obvious and repeated violations of its meaning and effectivity are avoided. Therefore I do not find so shocking Robert Keohane's statement that sovereignty is a bargaining resource' in a situation of global interdependence.65 Contrary to a rather widespread thesis,66 sovereignty as a juridical concept is not absolute (unique and above everything) , despite the interpretation we might derive from a part of the early twentieth-century German legal doctrine. Neither is it an inconsistency for an international system to be founded both on limits put to the states' competences and on the formal assumption of the sovereign equality of states,67 provided the states have consented to those limits by using their free (legal) will under factual constraints that they have to assess and put up with. Although it is quite possible that the argument of the limits on sovereignty might be manipulated to 'rationalize a narrowing of political possibilities and diminished sense of human agency which pervades politics today',68 a legitimate concern shared by Simon Hix and several political liberals,69 it does not follow that the two statements are identical. The first is legal and the second is sociopolitical, the proof being that Hix is a federalist who is rather hostile to the member states' sovereignty without pleading pp. 657-70.

It is true that the current debates about the transformations of 'private' international law and the extension of the lex mercatorìa may lead to a demise of sovereignty, detrimental to social rights.70 That highly technical debate opposes a liberal vision that makes the parties' autonomy a consequence of the public law, since their autonomy is conceded by the state or the agreement between states (according to the concept of the polity I have outlined71) to a neolib- eral vision. That vision makes the parties' autonomy the fundamental rule facilitated by the actors' mobility and enables them to do their shopping among the member states' national economies and their legal systems as it is recognized by the ECJ in the Laval case and regulated by different rulings of the EU ('Rome 1' art. 3; 'Brussels l', art. 23). More important, beyond and despite regulation, the most powerful private actors may treat national laws as commodities and use their mobility to appropriate the state regulations by exporting their activity's social cost,72 thus creating a well-known situation of 'moral hazard'.73 Such a trend is resisted by the ECJ, which has refused to recognize the primacy of the judge chosen by one party to rule on the validity of a jurisdiction clause when a parallel procedure has been previously engaged (ECJ, December 2003, Gasser , C-116/ 70 On the particular example of private international law, Nils Jansen and Ralf Michaels, 'Private Law Beyond the State?

To make things a little clearer to non-lawyers, let us say that the ECJ, while bound to stimulate the legislative competition between member states (to the imperialists' satisfaction), expresses here a federal resistance to globalization and accordingly the expansion of private laws, a resistance ill-perceived in Britain (the same debate takes place about inheritance laws) . In doing so the Court may help to avoid the downward spiral that would bring social norms into line with those least favourable to the workers74 - a powerful argument for the federalists who hold that only a federal Europe can be a social Europe and resist the manipulations that result from globalization. Keohane's argument lends itself to such manipulations if interdepen- dence is left to the unilateral interpretation of a particular state, or group of states, thus making any choice over whether a state should or not be bound by the EU's rules disappear from the landscape, replaced by the inescapable interdependence recalling Brezhnev's doctrine of limited sovereignty, and raising some international rules to the status of dogmas. The EU is at times accused of behaving as infamously in Eastern Europe as the Soviet Union did, with economic rules replacing Marxist political ideology.75 There is a little truth in such bold judgements and we will show that it is permissible to see the acquis communautaire as a new dogma, something Zielonka will do his best both to vindicate and to prove that it is not infringing on the member states' autonomy. It remains that the states are still free not to apply for membership and that the EU does not need a Red Army. Actually, the debate is perhaps less about sovereignty (national or European) than about whether or not the European Social Charter should be a part of the European dogmas. Last, I have to say something more than a passing comment about the problems regarding war and security, at least in their most extreme forms. Is European integration 'a solution to war'?76 This is a world 74 H. Muir-Watt, 'Les normes sociales et le marché global du travail: comment sortir de la spirale vers le bas?', in A. Lyon-Caen and Q.

But we have conveniently forgotten that it is also a world where the most murderous war since the Second World War, involving 14 states and parties, ended only in 2002 out of sheer exhaustion after the loss of more than 4 million lives (the war in Congo), where ever-expanding nuclear proliferation is a permanent fact of life and brutal physical violence is considered a normal way to play politics in most parts of Caucasus, Asia and Africa (its consequence being the dominance of asymmetric wars77).

It is fasci- nating to notice that the rapid spreading of the legal notion of 'crime against human- ity' used by serious UN reports to expose, say, the actions of Tsahal and the Hamas in Gaza goes hand in hand with the development of this type of war, although the concept was constructed out of the asymmetric behaviour of states agents during the 'symmetric war' of 1939-45. Let me use that example to emphasize that in a world where military expenditures exceeded 1.2 trillion in current dollars in 2006 (SIPRI Yearbook 2007, Armaments, Disarmament and International Security, Oxford and Stock- holm, Oxford University Press and International Peace Research Institute, 2007) the probability of a mega war (a symmetric transformational war analogous to the Napo- leonic wars and the Second World War) is 'no less than about 15% and most likely around 20%, that is 10 to 100 times higher than the probability of global natural catastrophes and infinitely more destructive than global terrorism' (Vaclav Smil, Global Catastrophes and Trends: The Next Fifty Years, Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 2007). I would not have paid attention to this exercise in futurology and major risk assessment, being as aware as any well-heeled scholar of the futility of long-range prophecies and the prejudices carried along by these discursive social constructions and so on, had it not been for the prestige of its publishing house and, more important, the seriousness and prudence of its assessments (although certain comparisons between statistics regard- less of their meaning to the real people are somewhat farfetched) . © The Authors 2010.

Zielonka has a whole chapter on 'Governance Beyond Borders', focused more on the 'neo-medieval' way of ensur- ing a peaceful coexistence and preventing or managing conflicts than on 'hard cases', and his conclusion is surprisingly cautious. Colomer has logically determined that the democratic rulers' self- interest makes them think twice before engaging in warfare, except in the interest of political survival (p. 39), an important Schmittian conces- sion that simply poses the question one step further back: how are democratic rulers going to assess survival in the same way?78 His conclusion is to take as a current expression of empirical reality (actually to advocate) an 'idealistic realism' through which 'demo- cratic rulers may pretend to make the great powers' interests coincide with the diffusion of the values of freedom and democracy across the world', provided that they renounce the assumption that democracy requires nation state-building. According to Colomer, this is a mis- taken assumption that ignores the fact that democracy can work in polities other than the state and that an imperial polity may save the states from building their own centralized bureaucracies, armies and border controls (p. 40, an interesting inference that Hayek also makes regarding 'interstate federalism') . That leads him to a purely idealistic prescription for peace in the Arab world and the Middle East. The late Elie Kedourie (ignored by Colomer) used to say - not without seem- ingly good reasons - that nationalism had been the great disease passed from the Europeans on to the Arab world like an epidemic. However, is it enough to recommend the creation, through a revival of the 60-year-old Arab League, of a 'union of democracies, in several cases organized as federations of smaller units' (p. 41)? So easy! How can we have missed such a simple solution? However, the other prescriptions have not worked very well so far. Let us go back down to earth, from logic to sociology: the EU as a whole holds no hard power and therefore has determined that it 78 Charles de Gaulle and the arch-collaborationist Pierre Laval were both deeply devoted to France's survival in 1940. In 1940 Laval had as many patriotic and many more democratic and pacifist credentials than de Gaulle; in 1945 the former was executed for treason by the latter after a slapdash trial acclaimed by the vast demo- cratic majority of the French people.

The EU has some capabilities it may be willing to use in a war on something, preferably poverty or violations of basic human rights rather than on terrorism. The latter has been discredited as a casus belli , and so making the war on it is something both useless and illegitimate (for international and domestic reasons of its own the USA itself seems to have abandoned the 'war on terror' idiom after August 2009). The alternative view is implicitly discarded: that a war on terrorism is as stupid an idea as a war on war, since terrorism is itself a kind of war - a specific strategy pursued by at least one of the protagonists. The reason is fairly obvious: the EU has no intention of waging a war on someone except as a possible indirect consequence of the soft-hard power that consists in proposing rewards and with- drawing them when the other party fails to behave as we hoped in response to our incentives. The current relationship with a proto- nuclear Iran, where democratic elections seem to have been rigged, give a serious headache to everyone, yet in Europe, Germany, Italy and France are at great pains to reach a common decision to act. 'When there is no solution there is no problem', the cynical saying goes. Accordingly, the EU has no official threatening enemy, only a 'turbulent environment' liable to cause shocks to be cushioned.79 'No enemy, no war'. Yet the adage is not quite accurate in the European situation. The EU, by denying the existence of a problem, has found a solution to another - and, for some, more pressing - difficulty: war can no longer coexist with democracy. The mere possibility of war threatens democracy as soon as something that the rulers claim to be a crisis gives rise to a 'culture of emergency' blurring the boundary between foreign war and domestic crisis, thus favouring a concentra- tion of power in the governments' hands and edging the other countervailing powers out of decision-making.80 The solution to the 79 Knut-Eric Jorgensen, 'The European Union's Performance in World Polities', in Jan Zielonka (ed.), Paradoxes of European Foreign Policy, The Hague, Kluwer, 1998.

There is a far-reaching fringe benefit to such an intellectual posture: it eschews the dilemma gripping the people (scholars and politicians alike) caught in the different temporalities of politics and global problems. Global problems are very long-range problems and managing them forces one to take the long view and to put the interests of the whole world to the forefront, as if it was a single democratic polity of which all the members are increasingly depen- dent on one another and no member can claim a commanding place on top. Yet, politics takes its revenge when, confronted by a world-risk society, the same people tend to rely on their own community because their awareness of the short-term problems makes them discount the long-term ones, just as the rulers who are close to them are more amenable to their concerns than the distant members of a world government unless it is composed of philosopher-kings. Hence the return to an international view of the world as a system of polities and the recurring question, which should not be asked if one believed seriously in a single world community: which nation (s) will rule the world?81 The European answer is that the pacifists will rule projection of Socialist Realism onto the whole society (which is true) minus the KGB and the gulags. Besides, he does not deign to notice that what is a disastrous conse- quence in the USA is precisely the beneficial goals intentionally pursued by their enemies (say, the Afghan Talibans) , namely the conflation of foreign war and domestic conflicts and the promotion of a 'culture of emergency' - two core features of times of war. However he may be right on one point: the 'civic war' may look to be a way to escape the perverse effect of America's global aspiration to pre-eminence as an exem- plar of democratic potential, namely its increasing exposure to critical assessments of its democratic credentials (as noted by M. Foley, American Credo. The Place of Ideas in US Politics , Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 466) since in times of war the democratic standards should be significantly lower, at least to the national public opinion. Unfortunately it is exposed to the retort that it is wrong and non-democratic for a democracy to wage this kind of war. The EU may think that its peaceful outlook protects it from such an indictment, which remains to be seen. There is no logical solution reconciling political ethics and materiel security when some parties have decided one is their enemy whatever one claims to be. 81 Vaclav Smil (Smil, Global Catastrophes) looks to be a victim of such an apparent contradiction but it is probably due to his keen awareness of the two pictures of the world involved in the assessments of different risks, a political whole, a universum, pictured for example by the demographer Joel Cohen in his projection for 2050 © The Authors 2010.

They will act as if there was already some world polity in the making, of which the core identity consists in being, as Zaki Laidi puts it, 'risk averse' in matters of war, environment and finance. The term 'rule the world' still sounds too authoritarian and hegemo- nial; the correct expression should be 'they will possess the earth', but that sounds a little too evangelical. The EU is decisively a pacifist actor of a special kind. The usual pacifism means only the exhaustion of all the peaceful means to manage conflicts with enemies who are not of our own choosing; they choose us for good reasons of their own. Of course the enemies have the same opinion, the roles are simply reversed; even provocative and jeering North Korea may argue that it feels threatened by the nuclear umbrella supplied by the USA to Japan and South Korea. In the same way the noisy Libyan crowd had good reasons for greeting with cheers, in the towering presence of the president-for-life's son, one of the convicted killers of the Lockerbie bombing, compassionately released by the Scottish government in August 2009 after serving eight years in jail (perhaps for the sake of British realist interests hidden behind humanitarian medical reasons). The crux of the matter is that, very often, a polity has enemies not because of what it does but of what it is; what it does is perceived through a lens of its past actions - there is some hidden truth in the much-derided notion of ennemi héréditaire. For example, many European states may be resented as 'powers of an unjust status quo', guilty of aggression against the peoples of the Middle East (among others) and of covert complicity with American actions in Iraq, as documented and denounced by the report of the Swiss senator Marty to the Council of Europe. The European pacifism goes one step further by determin- ing that, since Europe is nobody's enemy , Europe has no enemy (except the 'enemies of humankind'), only unwise neighbours who have not yet understood their interest in recognizing that they could be friends. Therefore the best way to avoid war is not only to stay neutral (as the European neutralists claimed to no avail at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s) but also to deny war's existential possibility and to (J. Cohen, 'Make Secondary Education Universal', Nature , 4 December, 2008, here again the prestige of the journal has made me take it seriously) or a world divided into different polities, a pluriversum.

Actually, as such a position is indefen- sible as a political position, in many cases the decisions are made by the states, within the UN or NATO (noticeably in Afghanistan where a 30-year war is under way, with in addition more than a touch of the Vietnam War), or on their own. Thus the member states go into action regardless of the convoluted provisions of the Title V, Article J.4 of the Amsterdam Treaty of 1992, which should be compared to the crystal-clear stillborn EDC Treaty of 1953 that mentions in its Preamble a 'supra-national European Organization'. Different states have different foreign policies, going from an Irish quasi-neutrality82 to British or Polish commitments; Great Britain has been at war in various theatres since 1939, despite Orwell's remark on 'the English hatred for war and militarism' - not such an English peculiarity nowadays in Europe, where the states have to cope with resistance from public opinion and scarce military resources. Even in interna- tional trade it is not certain that this supra-national Europe actually exists, since the EU's successful role in multilateral trade negotiations (predicted by Patrick Messerlin and documented by Sophie Meu- nier83) does not prevent the member states from competing harshly for the conquest of foreign markets and treating commercial bal- ances as part of high-power politics related to the security of territo- rial peoples with little mobility. A fortiori the EU's 'common "security strategy" is not a security strategy'.84 82 On Ireland, in comparison to Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, see N. G.

That is related to the institutional inconsistency of the European foreign policy-making (Hill, 'Convergence, Divergence and Dialectics'). It is also related to a type of rhetoric emphasizing 'security' as a presupposition of individual well-being, or as itself an element of individual well-being, rather than the state of a political unit facing a potential enemy (Emma Rothschild, 'What is Security?', Daedalus, 122 (1995), pp. 53-98).

Admittedly, the existence of OCCAR may lead, together with the creation of the European Defence Agency (EDA) , to a shift from a common European preference in matters of procurement to a pref- erence in matters of military goals through the 'military capability debate'.85 However, for the time being, the shift from a military policy dealing with ways and means to a defence policy dealing with goals is far from being achieved, so the EU looks to be constructing a tool without knowing exactly when and how to use it, and why it is doing so. One may wonder if the impressive European diplomatic service with a big budget described in detail by the new Lisbon Treaty (one has carefully avoided calling it a 'foreign office'; it is 'the external-action service') will not follow the same path, all the more so as the powerful high representative sitting at the top who is to head foreign operations of both the Commission and the Council86 needs to coexist with the UNESCO, 2007), 'welfare security' and 'desecuritizing securitization' (Olav Knudsen, 'Post-Copenhagen Security Studies: Desecuritizing Securitization', Security Dialogue, 32 (2001), pp. 355-68) that I hardly understand unless I resort to the recent financial language. In that area securitization means 'the slicing and dicing of illiquid assets such as mortgages', in which case the term would refer to the slicing of political concerns and assets and the refusal to put them within the all-encompassing context of the countries and the world's real security (analogous here to the real economy). 85 In accordance with the healthy distrust governing the relations between institu- tions and between member states, the composition of the service will be hotly debated.

That suffices to make the thesis of a kind of G2 made up of America and the EU, enjoying both legitimacy and power, look rather fanciful unless we go back 35 years to the Cold War and revive François Duchêne's notion of Europe as a 'great civilian Power' in a division of labour with the USA as a great military power,87 or we adopt Ferguson's thesis that Europe could, and should, have acted 'as a peacekeeper that follows in the wake of the peace-maker'. I would venture that the idea was floating about in many Europeans rulers' minds until 2003 despite some states' uneasy feelings about NATO, and it may still be alive in 2010 under the new Obama administration, especially with respect to Palestine and Afghanistan. More sober observers may conjecture a likelier G2 made up of the USA and China if the biggest debtor and its biggest creditor settle their differences. The key issue is the question of 'multilateralism', which has never been suitably defined since John Ruggie proposed its formula more than 15 years ago. He defined it as a certain form of international relations that coordinates behaviour between three or more parties on the basis of certain general principles of conduct, regardless of recommended to turn to the specialists, for example Douglas Porch, 'Military "Culture" and the Fall of France in 1940', International Security, 24: 4 (2000), pp. 157-80.

The idea of a G2 has been ventured by the prolific lawyer Philip Bobbitt, Terror and Consent: The Wars of the Twentieth Century, New York, Knopf, 2008, a view that would horrify Colomer, whose conceptualization of the current market state (or, in his terminology, market nation) is by and large similar to Bobbitt's, albeit more carefully crafted. Most supporters of a directory of Great Powers, like Richard Rosecrance, are much more multilateralist, at least as far as the decent peoples' (in John Rawls's parlance) interests are concerned (Rosecrance speaks of 'states', which makes all the difference with Rawls). Today, 'Civilian Power Europe' is used in quite a different sense, as a power that relies on the power of the norm, both the fount and the consequence of its influence in world affairs (Zaki Laidi, La norme sans la force.

At the European level, whatever the domain concerned (domestic European politics or international policy) , multilateralism is the only game in town, at least as a rhetoric often conflating multilateralism and multipolarity, two notions that should be carefully distinguished (mul tipolari ty implies a 'balance of power', a division of the world between powers that may even be enemies, whereas multilateralism implies that a whole has different sides). The problem is, as John Ruggie noticed, that 'the adjective multilateral modifies the noun institution yet it should not be (con) fused with any one particular institutional expression of it'. A mindset, however vague, is more reliable than a formal organization, yet both need each other.

The current EU, despite its power to regulate interstate commerce, is still closer to the American Articles of Confederation preceding the circulation of The Federalist's Papers and the holding of the Philadelphia Convention than to the text later issued from the Convention. 'Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence and every power, jurisdiction and right which is not by the Confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.' Moreover, in Europe nationalisms are no longer running the show, but they are still well and alive as 'banal nationalisms' of cultural-political entities (nationalism in Gellner's and Deutsch's sense as the story of a community of communications encompassing within the same territorial boundaries one economy, one culture and one polity, a story perhaps declining in Belgium and Spain, still unfinished in Balkan and Eastern Europe and under a destructive attack everywhere in the economic domain) rather than as a nationalist ideology (nationalism in Isaiah Berlin's sense, 'my nation, right or wrong, above and against the others, be they other nations or an international organization of some sort', and more, 'my nation should rule the world').89 The recent emphasis put on a mysterious economic patriotism bears witness to the resilience of the first type of nationalism, also illustrated by 'artistic nationalism' such as Greece's obstinate efforts to reclaim the Parthenon Marbles, which, incidentally, would have been lost for ever had not Lord Elgin stolen them. Last, a European people can, and should, coexist with European peoples. The Kelsen-Schmitt model that stipulates that a 'constitution makes a people' has no relevance in such a situation (during the constitutional debates, the American lawyer J. H. H.

After all, the Constitutio Westphalica predated the idea of constitution as we know it,91 and Britain does have a written constitution, interpreted by the courts (and now a constitutional court) , but it is not written all in one place; and among its various pieces there are even European texts that the courts are required to consider in order to assess whether British laws violate their provisions (the European Convention on Human Rights is a case in point and it does not emanate from the EU).92 Finally, the books reviewed here may take the same position across the dividing line: Zielonka is against a constitution but Hix is not a supporter of the document either since he holds the astounding view (to be explained later) that the main issue on the EU agenda is no longer 'how to construct the basic political and economic architecture of a continent-scale polity', the problem having been solved to the satisfaction of all countries and mainstream political groups. Thus the policy agenda 'has shifted from polity-building to what economic and social policies should be pursued' (p. 89).

To be sure, as far as the social question was concerned, the Communist Manifesto was about to steal the show, although the Socialist Internationale had to wait half a century to emerge. The story was first and foremost the (not so) oxymoronic story of a universalist federation of nationalists,96 keener on self-government than state control (the nuance is capital) that is typically a pre-Marxist and post-Wesphalian narrative. Today it could be José Bove' s story in France, or many anti-capitalist parties' story anywhere, from the GUE/NGL to a significant number of socialists, not to forget the greens who would be willing to accept the Soviet amendment of a 'federalism with national form and social content', had it been really implemented.97 Even Josep Colomer would accept it, provided the nation should not be a nation state and the rule of individual free choice would be beyond question. But another story, much older and pre-Westphalian, was flowing underground: the imperial story, dead today - or so Zielonka, Colomer and a host of intellectuals believe, as the story of colonial Europe and of Christian Europe (the final blow 95 It is worth recalling that the first appearance of the term ' impérialisme in French (1832, long before 'imperialism' was used in English by Charles Conant and John Hobson at the end of the nineteenth century, in a quite different, and rather deroga- tory, meaning) was in praise of the Napoleonic regime.

Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , preceded by Montes- quieu's questions, is the elaborate story produced in a system of Westphalian states that emerged fully through a long process in medieval times.99 The religious basis of this system was strongly opposed by Pope Innocent X in a rearguard battle when the treaties were signed in 1648-59 but they succeeded in accommodating the intractable problems brought about by the wars of religion (with for the first time the growth of Protestant kingdoms that led to the terri torialization of religion) and exacerbated by the Thirty Years 98 J.

Strayer, The Medieval Origins of the Modern State , Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1970, and of course Perry Anderson's volumes. Let us not forget the classics: 'The real state of the Middle Ages in the modern sense - if the words are not a paradox - is the Church' with its autonomous bureaucracy pursuing its own ends (J. Figgis, Political Thought from Gerson to Grotius, 1414-1625. Seven Studies, New York, Harper and Row, 1960). Lord Acton has shown that the 400-year conflict opposed two powers, both aiming at absolute civilizational authority. As they had to call the nations to their aid the conflict brought about the rise of civil liberty (Lord Acton, 'History of Freedom in Christianity', inj.

Von der Muhl, 'Ancient Empires, Modern States, and the Study of Government', Annual Review of Political Science, 6 (2003), pp. 45-76. As I am interested here in the passage from medievalism to modern states, I mention only in passing the rational- choice explanations of the power of a prince as the outcome of an unequal exchange between protection and taxation (F. C. Lane, Venise: une république maritime, Paris, Flammarion, 1985) , transformed by Tilly into a racket -a process of extortion facilitated by the increasing cost of war-making (C. Tilly, 'War Making and State Making as Organized Crime', in P. Evans, D. Rueschemeyer and T. Skocpol (eds ), Bringing the State Back In, New York, Cambridge University Press, 1985) . However, I have to admit that the thesis has been applied first of all to the formation of modern states (e.g. Margaret Levi, Consent, Dissent and Patriotism, New York, Cambridge University Press, 1997).

At the beginning this conflict saw a Catholic emperor opposing the rebellious Protestant Bohemians, but it progressively involved new actors, sometimes engaged in unexpected alliances when reli- gious, princely, national and imperial interests were so intertwined that the current peacelike European, and warlike Middle Eastern, politics look almost clear in comparison.100 Yet, the much longer- standing story had been for a millennium the story of Translatio Imperìi favoured by the neighbouring presence of Byzantium and of Islam, perceived as 'the significant Other'.101 This imperial tradition was inveterate even during the Dark Ages of the fourth to tenth 100 Peter Wilson, Europe's Tragedy. A History of the Thirty Years War, London, Allen Lane, 2008. This huge book has made me realize the unthinkable (to contemporary liberal and peaceful minds who ignore what is happening today in Africa) magnitude of the most destructive war (in relative numbers) in European history, the Napoleonic and the two World Wars included (the Holy Roman Empire lost about 20 per cent of its population; by comparison the USSR lost 12 per cent and Poland possibly 15 per cent of their populations in the Second World War) . Wilson notes that the horrors of the war stemmed less from political and religious motives than from want of money and credit. I cannot help thinking that a total war, once launched by an intractable conflict over the nature of the polity, is self-sustaining, as the war lives on the civilians, and consumes its children, as the French and Soviet revolutions did, 150 and 270 years later. This appalling way to move to an autonomization of politics was not fatal, however. A more peaceful process was advocated in sixteenth-century France by Michel de L'Hospital and the parti des politiques and was actually taking place at the grassroots level (see O. Christin, La paix de religion. L' autonomisation de la raison politique au XVIème siècle, Paris, Le Seuil, 1997). 101 When, in 1209 Pope Innocent III decided, rather unwillingly, to launch the Crusade in Toulouse against the Albigensians, who were Christians albeit heretics, the petty local counts who supported them more or less openly did not think of looking to nearby Islam for help. Several centuries later, in the sixteenth century when François I signed with the Ottoman Empire the famous treaties of capitulation, the Moroccan king, Moulay Ahmad al-Mansûr - who was building up his own legitimacy as the Soltan-Charif of a centralized monarchy against the same Ottoman Empire - was getting the support of Philippe II's Spain by utilizing the struggle between the Habs- burg and Ottoman empires, then turned against Spain and tried an alliance with Henry VIII's England that could not survive the cultural incompatibilities between the two countries. Actually Ahmad al-Mansûr was interested in Henry VIII's rejection of the pope's clerical authority not only because of the realist political alliance he was trying to build up but also because it divided and weakened the main 'Other', Chris- tendom. Likewise, the many English who lived in Morocco, whether they became Muslim or not, were interested in what was going on in the country and in the empire because they wanted to do business, rather than create a 'dialogue of civilizations' (see Nabil Mouline, Le califat imaginaire d' Ahmad al-Mansûr, Paris, PUF, 2009). © The Authors 2010.

Even though Roman law waned, it was taken as a model by Theodoric and his enemy Clovis in the sixth century102 and codified a little later in Byzantium by Justinian, who reconstituted the whole empire for a short while. The later conflict between papacy and empire, was part and parcel of the same worldview, as Carl Schmitt has made clear. This was the view (meaning here both a description and a 'well-grounded illusion') of a world of diverse cultures, ethnic groups, cities and principalities supposedly unified under the same civilizational symbols of a moral-political order phrased in a religious language where Christianity had replaced the mere primacy of the emperor's religion over other religions accepted as parts of a reli- gious 'pluriverse'. In this respect it is mistaken and anachronistic to deem the Holy Roman Empire 'secular', as Zielonka does (p. 157): the Church was ecclesiastical but the empire was not secular.103 Trans- latio Imperii was a way to cope with the stunning movement of political time whose Augustine was the prominent witness, by imagining a political space as both the heir of a past space and the image of a future space.104 102 See the reassessment of Chris Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome.

Ferguson carries the story up to the 2000s by discussing 'the case for liberal empire', an unabashed plea for the benefits brought about by the imperial endeavour; He strongly advises the USA to begin its work 'in wretched Liberia' (pp. 178-9). The problem with Ferguson is that, despite some foolish state- ments, his arguments are very often well grounded . . . and out of touch with the political reality constructed by the real politics of the agents, from the bottom to the top. He is a wonderful case of scholarly erudition gone crazy through an excess of rationality. For a version limited to a few cases, M. Ignatieff, Empire Lite, Nation Building in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, New York, Vintage Books, 2003 (six years later, two cases, at the very least, do not bear witness to the achievements of this type of 'empire'). 105 In the comparative history of China and Rome the problem is the sequence of autocratic (at the centre) and imperial (at the periphery) rules, the two cases showing inverted sequences (W. Schneidel (ed.), Rome and China. Comparative Perspectives on Ancient World Empires, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2008). See in general Michael Doyle, Empires, Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press, 1986. His core definition involves a strong and insulated centre, a periphery submitted to a hierarchical domination and a coercive and corrupting control, so deprived of sovereign autonomy (p. 12). In his first attempt at conceptualization Alexander Motyl, influenced by his study of the Soviet Empire, emphasized the distinction between a core population and a peripheral population and the dictatorial relationship between the core elite and the peripheral elite (A. Motyl, 'Thinking About Empire', in K. Barkey and M. von Hagen (eds), After Empire. Multiethnic Societies and Nation-Building, Boulder, CO, Westview, 1997).

The practice was still in force in the French Westphalian state: the Italian Giulo Mazzarini was the controversial yet immovable prime minister in 1648-61 and the Swiss Jacques Necker was minister of finance in 1789. 107 Amy Chua, reconciling the opposite views of 'empire by conquest' and 'empire as a commonwealth', has argued that an empire is doomed to fail if it is unable to be tolerant, intolerance being a sign of decay (Amy Chua, Day of Empire. She is careful to stress the difference from the Enlightenment idea of toleration that is based on secularist individualism and is an outcome of the Westphalian order). Despite the Antonines and the Edict of Caracalla granting Roman citizenship to all the free men of the empire, it is doubtful that an empire at its pinnacle is always a model of toleration, even in the pre-Enlightenment sense (to leave the subjected groups to believe whatever they like so long as they remain peaceful and cooperative, a sense likely to surface again, now that the Enlightenment is no longer viewed as a universal road to progress but just as one road among others). The conqueror Timur at his zenith is no more enticing than Diocletian at his twilight eight centuries earlier and Lord Acton has wonderfully shown the similarity between Diocletian's and Constan- tine's schemes of policy, strengthening the emperor's arbitrary authority with, in Constan tine's case, the support of a religion that had astonished the world by its power of resistance ('History of Freedom', p. 29). On the Islamic empires and toleration see the sobering account of Ephraim Karsh, Islamic Impeńalism, A History, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 2007, too focused on the last two centuries and the decay of the Ottoman Empire relayed by Pan-Islamism and Arab nationalism (which is question- able).

To put it simply, charisma - be it 'extraordinary and transformational' or 'routinized and consolidated', personal or institutional - refers to a 'descending legitimacy', an ordo rerum, an 'order of things' whose value cannot be changed by the citizens' and politicians' choices. It can only be implemented and interpreted because it expresses a deep connec- tion between the values governing politics and the rules governing social, personal and above all natural life, whether they are religious, scientific or simply moral.110 It may even be claimed that although charisma trumps the other Weberian types of legitimacy (this is the 109 Alexander Motyl, 'Is Empire Everything?

Most of it focus on the 'neo-charismatic para- digm' in organizational research (R. J. House, 'A 1976 Theory of Charismatic Lead- ership', inj. G. Hunt and L. L. Larson (eds), Leadership: The Cutting Edge, Carbondale, Southern Illinois University Press, 1977; J. MacGregor Burns, Leadership, New York, Harper and Row, 1978; J.

Madsen and P. G. Snow, The Charismatic Bond: Political Behavior in Time of Crisis, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1996) with the ensuing problem of leadership change and the succession dilemma (R. Burling (ed.), The Passage of Power: Studies in Political Succession, New York, Academic Press, 1974). The main debates have been about the heroic bias (D. K. Simonton, Genius, Creativity and Leadership: Historiometric Inquiries, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1974; G. Yukl, 'An Evaluation of Conceptual Weaknesses in Transformational and Charismatic Leadership', Leadership Quarterly, 10: 2 (1999), pp. 285-305) versus the structural and contextual approach (J. M. Beyer, 'Taming and Promoting Cha- risma to Change Organizations', Leadership Quarterly, 10: 2 (1999), pp. 307-30; H. B. Jones, 'Magic, Meaning and Leadership: Weber's Model and the Empirical Literature', Human Relations, 54: 6 (2001), pp. 753-71), the problems raised by the use of charisma in the context of secularization (S. Turner, 'Charisma Reconsidered', Journal of Clas- sical Sociology, 3 (2003), pp. 5-26), which may lead to the fallacy of using charisma in a vulgar and ill-defined way as a successful leader's quality, thus making the reasoning circular since successful politicians are easily called charismatic while unsuccessful politicians will never become charismatic (W.

The core point is that only a new charisma may bring about social change, the process of 'ordinary' politics being powerless and even dangerous if it aims to create a new social order by legislation instead of following the old ways of the law (after all, Hayek's catallaxy is nothing other than both the conservative and innovative ways of submitting to the imper- sonal charisma of the cosmos-taxis combination that is embodied in Hume's laws of justice). Therefore, Popper's 'piecemeal change' will be achieved much more efficiently through non-political agencies and bureaucratic andjudiciary activities than through the ambitious, noisy and often cheap talk of the political debates typical of domestic processes. This is where the social polity comes in.112 A social polity is a polity where the organization and language do not clearly differentiate de jure concrete empirical politics from other domains of social life. The opposite, a political society, is endowed with a highly differentiated machinery and a specific language making up the champ politique , known as such ('politics') and not merely practised under another name.113 In a democratic political Discontent: Empirical Tests of Explanation of LPF Support', Acta Politica, 38: 1 (2003), pp. 89-106). Naturally, as - following Eisenstadt and Shils - I am interested in the institutional aspect of charisma, only the topic of secularization will be treated here. 111 M. Suchman and L.

This is what struck Tocqueville ('society acts by itself on itself) and how Madison seemed to understand it, which led him to the conclusion that for the majority not to be unjustly oppressive under the veil of society, it had to be divided into 'so many descriptions of citizens as will render any combination of a majority on the whole very improbable, if not impracticable'.114 But such a justification presupposes the existence of a political society; it would not even be thinkable in a social polity where there is no champ politique to be legitimized by a democratic device. A social polity does not need democracy as a political system. More precisely, the democratic language is alien to the very idea of social polity, what the Islamist intellectuals well know when they hold democracy to be contradictory to the UmmaĶ a Muslim social polity (self-) governed by the respect of a god-given law. To be a little more explicit, the democratic language is not banned out of an authoritar- ian contempt for the people (as usual, such a contempt may be lurking behind the discourse), but as an example of any kind of came to be used in the mid-twentieth century to disparage low politics practised by the politicos (actually all the politicians) . Jean Laponce has cleverly noted that 'modern politics' has become explicitly a system of opposition of parties challenging a natural order of things, which explains both its location on the negative side of the overall system of perceptions (religion staying on the positive side) and the positive assessment of the left (usually downgraded in ordinary non-political language) within the seman- tic order named 'polities', since in modern times politics is the mirror image of an immovable order of things (Jean Laponce, Left and Right. The Topography of Political Perceptions , Toronto and London, University of Toronto Press, 1981, pp. 13 and 43-6). See also a truly European history of the left, both Western and Eastern, where socialism is interpreted as the struggle to expand democracy, thus making this very thick book both wanting as historical scholarship (colonialism is lightly treated) and successful as a tentative grand narrative (Geoff Eley, Forging Democracy. The History of the Left in Europe, 1850-2000, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002). 114 I am indebted to Christopher Bickerton for making this point, which he utilizes to show that the Madisonian limitation of powers is internal to the concept of popular sovereignty and thus requires the concept of sovereignty, contrary to what K. Nicolaï- dis, among others, asserts (Nicolaïdis and Howse, The Federal Vision', Nicolaïdis, 'Con- sti tutionalizing the Federal Vision?').

Admittedly, any polity needs a set of over- arching beliefs maintained above conflictual dissensus to constitute the 'cement of society' and all the more so if it is a free society. To quote Tocqueville again: T tend to think that if a people wants to be free, he must believe, and if he does not, he must serve'; compare this with John Stuart Mill's chapter 'On Nationality' in his Representative Government. Yet it still makes a big difference whether we consider these supra-political norms as emerging from the agents' conscious political consent to their public culture so that they become their authors and may modify them (that is what The Federalist meant and what struck Tocqueville) or if we see them as expressing an ordo rerum. This is precisely what Rawls meant when he stated that his theory of justice was 'political, not metaphysical'. Are we light years away from the current European Union? When José Manuel Barroso maintains that 'there is no politics at the Com- mission' to the amazement of Simon Hix, he is not so foolish, or canting, as he looks: he knows full well that real politics is one of the main games real actors play, even in Brussels (this former professor of international relations was for a time the Portuguese prime minister) , nor does he revive the old Gaullist image of the Commission as a 'technocratic Areopagus'. He only means that the policy choices made at Brussels cannot be phrased in the language of political choices, any more than can the political choices made by the ECB115 or by the 35 or so agencies operating throughout Europe. He may say so to placate the members of the Council who are always concerned about the Com- mission's initiatives, but here the argument is more interesting than the motives behind it: what he puts forward is the (intended or unintended) outcome of definite political choices (fully conscious or incremental) , an outcome that in turn becomes one of the main inputs governing the European political game. The members of the Euro- pean Council who in June 2009 endorsed grudgingly but unanimously his candidature to a second term may chide him for not being inspirational enough and for trying to please everyone, but they know 115 Like the ECJ (see above, note 5), the ECB, which is the most independent bank in the world (apart from the much less powerful World Bank), has a policy and a strategy that can be studied by using the principal-agent model (R.

Actually they are chiding their own hypocrisy, transferring their guilt onto Mr Barroso and keeping intact their proclaimed commitment to a truly political Europe, which is in reality ruled out by the logic of its rationale. The European Parliament (EP) might be considered the only place where people use the language of politics in a European polity, yet we should note that that language is not at all similar to the language of national parliaments. Here lies the huge difference in the institu- tions, much more than in the voters' low turn-out, since abstention has not the same meaning according to the ties binding the repre- sentatives to their constituencies and the type of political language used. The EP's language is less confrontational, as befits a parliament that is more 'working' than 'talking'. When it happens to talk (seldom about great European questions116) its language - distinct from its practice - is more driven by axiological rationality (stating principles regardless of the consequences) than by instrumental rationality (reserved to the working feature) . Although I must confess that I find the working language, for all its jargonish technicalities, refreshing and soothing compared to the constant nastiness and aggressiveness of the national political languages, I also have to admit that the talking language makes the parliament at times look more like a giant NGO matching up big words with small deeds117 than the policy-making body it is. Curiously yet logically enough, the more it expresses symbolic values (the great utterances, usually the preserve of exceptional and constituent moments), the less it is granted a symbolic institutional value of its own. Rozenberg thinks that the 116 Paul Magnette, 'La difficile parlementarisation de l'Union', in Pascal Delwit and Philippe Poirier (eds), Parlement puissant, électeurs absents?

In December, the exchange was still confrontational, but then the style was more the style of a French-French controversy, and Sarkozy mischievously retorted to Cohn-Bendit that he was not talking politics 'the European way', that is, in a moderate and consensus-seeking way.

Secondarily, the more it is efficient in the policy process and perceived as such,118 the less the citizens are interested in its working. The real problem is not the 'Orleanism' of the European public space, noted by Paul Magne tte and modelled on the practices of the French monarchie de juillet (1830-48) 119 - its restriction to the con- cerned interest and public action groups - although that may be questioned, 'comitology' being more a fixture of the Commission and hence detrimental to the Parliament.120 Olivier Rozenberg may 118 The EP's efficiency has not been hindered by the enlargement (R. Dehousse, F. Deloche-Gaudez and O. Duhamel (eds), Elargissement. Comment l'Europe s'adapte , Paris, Presses de Sciences-po, 2006). According to Eurobarometer, the proportion of people thinking that the EP plays an important role in EU's affairs has moved up from 62 per cent in 2000 (with 15 member states) to 75 per cent in 2007 (with 27 members). See Eurobarometer 53 and 68: 1 . In 2007, the EP was believed by 43 per cent of the Europeans to be holding 'the greatest power of decision within the EU today', against 14 per cent for the Commission and 10 per cent for the Council (this is not recent, see O. Niedermayer, 'Turn-out in the European Elections', Electoral Studies , 9: 1 (1990), pp. 45-50). These findings, which strengthen the position of Simon Hix, also vindicate Olivier Rozenberg's interpretation (Rozenberg, 'L'influence du Parlement européen', p. 12). He notices, however (p. 21, n. 17), that in 2009, while a plurality of 46 per cent says it should play a more important role, the minority saying the opposite has gone up to 22 per cent from 12 per cent {Eurobarometer 68: 1 and 71: 1). 119 Paul Magnette, L'Europe, l'Etat et la démocratie.

As the many studies of comitology allow us to draw any kind of institutional conclusion one may wish (Orleanism, interest group politics, deliberative intergovern- mentalism, good governance with strong publics, oligarchic governance with weak publics etc.), I no longer think that this useful descriptive concept has any interest in the identification of the European polity, or of any polity for that matter except a corporatist polity, since it expresses the ubiquitous and banal tensions between inter- ests' representation and political representation, 'expertocracy' and democracy. © The Authors 2010.

The first is the absence of elites of a European citizenry, only the elites of national citizenries are included in the Orleanist picture; admittedly they are also European but it is a different matter to be really a member of a real collective from just having the status of membership of a legal formal one. Second is the fact, also noticed by Rozenberg and others, that the EP's effective participation in policy-making is stimulated by its electoral support's weakness , which may be a blessing in disguise as we will show in the next section, but is still a paradox to the democratic theorists who do not have a go at democratic elitism. Likewise it may well be that the Parliament's ability to come to reasonable compro- mises for the common good and the absence of pork-barrel politics (concentrated benefits and diffuse costs)123 are precisely due to its insulation from democratic pressures. As we will see in the last section 121 Rozenberg, 'L'influence du Parlement européen', p. 31. 122 Although the social background of deputies has changed through an incremen- tal process, 'politicians have become a self-referential group' (M. Cotta and H. Best (eds), Democratic Representation in Europe, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 474-9. Also, M. Cotta and H. Best (eds), Parliamentary Representatives in Europe, 1848- 2000. Legislative Recruitment and Careers in Eleven European Countries, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2000). That reminds us of the French Fourth Republic's 'windowless house'. Weber with his professionals of politics and Ostrogorski with his party machines are vindicated beyond their worse fears. Small wonder that the concept of representation has moved up to the imperial presidencies or the plebiscitarían lead- ership called for by Weber (in several democratic states, from the USA to members of the EU, but certainly not at the EU level, where it is made unthinkable) and down to variegated forms of functional and self-authorized representation (in the EU and elsewhere at all levels, see N.

Even within the various and highly political Councils of Ministers, where the built-in tendency of sectoral ministers to cooperate even against their own government is matched by the equally built-in tendency of the heads of states to fight harshly when their countries' national interests are at stake, the vote by unanimous decision, despite the supra-national or federal rule of a super-majority, far from bringing evidence of the immovable resilience of sovereignties, only shows the common determination apparently to take the only possible decision, a non-political one. In the language of interna- tional relations, it is a decision by 'consensus and no-objection'. Indeed, the members do their best to hide the fact that some deci- sions are majoritarian (as an open political choice should be) and to present a façade of unanimity so the losers do not appear as a minority of losers. This avoids the losers paying too heavy a price in front of their national constituencies that are their main interest, since they are not concerned about a European constituency to whom they barely talk, even when addressing the Parliament ('Gov- ernment ministers and national party leaders will not want to reveal publicly that they lose any key battle', as Simon Hix puts it, p. 89). So they resort to the classical politics of blame avoidance by feigning not to be defeated whereas in other matters, where the Commission is more involved, the same strategy incites the national governments to put the blame on Brussels, or to criticize the heavy-handed policy of the yellow cards (which are not without relation to the clerical power to brandish the threat of excommunication or to grant indul- gences). All that comes at a price: under the false pretence of a clear population of its Makhzen and the loyal members of its periphery. There are many other types of this ubiquitous phenomenon close to clientelism (the papal selling of indulgences, for example). 124 That does not mean that European concerns, however downgraded, do not matter to the voters. In more down-to-earth bread-and-butter matters they tend to participate more in European elections when they belong to countries or regions where the benefits brought by the Commission's specific actions are well perceived (M. Mattila, 'Why Bother? Determinants of Turnout in European Elections', Electoral Studies, 22: 3 (2003), pp. 449-68). © The Authors 2010.

That is not quite the case in the European Parliament and not at all in the Council, which were designed to avoid that such a situation (that actually does exist) be laid bare. Some difference indeed. In any case, the formula at the root of the strategies of depoliticization is simply: The emperor is always good under his clothes, only his bureaucracy should be criticized and constrained to appear as it really is, naked' (of course, the bureaucracy does its best to stay conveniently clothed). 12 ' I am relying on the work of Stephanie Novak although the interpretation I propose is mine with all its possible flaws.

I only maintain that in European studies the art gives rise to rather strange typologies (see in the same vein J. Caporaso, 'The European Union and Forms of State: Westphalian, Regulatory or Post Modern?', Journal of Common Market Studies, 34: 1 (1996), pp. 24-52). As there is a plethora of literature on the 'new public management', I will mention a few indispensible titles: Christopher Hood, 'Contemporary Public Management: A New Global Paradigm', Public Policy and Administration, 10: 2 (1995), pp. 104-17; B.

In the way that it is expounded it reminds us of the elephant question: is it a flock of sheep, a wolf or a new set of teeth? Staying away from those theoreti- cal generalizations, I tend to see the new modes of governance as examples of imperial government or, perhaps more accurately, cleri- cal government, to capture the idea of a would-be polity where poli- tics would be everywhere, provided it is not considered as a specific domain, in other words a social polity. In the EU, it takes an addi- tional turn: its members do not want to recognize, to Simon Hix's sorrow, that, inside , in European politics , the EU always make political - non-consensual - choices, but they should not be recognized as such. On the other hand they may advocate in other circumstances the idea of a political Europe in world politics and in some matters, such as social policy or the management of the economic downturn, some members or some groups may lament the lack of a common Euro- pean policy (true, when there is one, like the Common Agricultural Policy, it is vilified by other members and other groups) . Yet, even in world politics, nowadays global politics, the clerical image is casting its spell in respect of human rights and climate change (witness the recent call by Daniel Cohn-Bendit for a unanimous position by all the - French - political parties on the eve of the December 2009 Copen- hagen meeting) where it meets its old enemy, political realism.129 Union as a Coxswain. Governance by Steering', inj. Pierre (ed.), Debating Governance, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 19-40. Beware of Chairman Mao, the 'Great Helmsman'!) . Likewise I should not have missed 'cluster policies', a term forged by managerial sciences to refer to the very simple collaboration of public and private actors in specific areas and territories, of which some features may be interesting to explore (S. Borras and D. Tsagdis, Cluster Policies in Europe. Firms, Institutions and Governance, Cheltenham, Edward Elgar, 2008). My apologies. For a political assess- ment, see S.

In this (rare) case of a supra-political consensus, the multilevel government is working: while the European Emissions-Trading Scheme (ETS) controlled by the Commission determines the level of the carbon price and the emission caps (the latter being contested by Italy and most of Eastern Europe), the member states have much leeway to take additional measures, such as imposing a minimum price on carbon (e.g. France), introducing a carbon tax © The Authors 2010.

Zielonka does not think that institution fits within his framework, it is here just as a minor speck of dirt on his neat picture (we will return to that later) . We might note that in the ultimately failed Bismarckian Reich the Bundesrat (the Chamber of States) steadily gained more powers to the detriment of the Reich- stag, but although the comparison could vindicate Zielonka as the Bundesrat was a tool against the parliamentarization of the empire, it would embarrass him since the Reich was organized under Prussian hegemony, and the bureaucratic monarchic structure invaded it to the very detriment of the Bundesrat itself.130 That is precisely the situation that Zielonka thinks impossible and unwanted in the Euro- pean Union, no more than a Weimarian evolution. The main paradox is not even that; in international relations a sizeable number of Wesphalian states - Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands - were the centres of new colonial empires of great magnitude, The Age of [colonial] Empires' being (hotly debated in France) or granting subsidies to renewable energies (e.g. Germany and Spain). See the British Committee on Climate Change's first report, issued in October 2009. Besides, it strengthens the power of the Union as long as it does not meet other Great Powers that do not take the problem as seriously as the EU. For once, public opinion matches governments' policies. For instance, while 77 per cent of the British and 76 per cent of the French say that their government should give a higher priority to climate change, only 52 per cent of the USA agree. It is true that 48 per cent of Germans share this opinion but the difference is that Germany figures among the three countries whose governments receive the highest scores when assessed on how high a priority they actually give to climate change whereas the US government gets one of the lowest scores on the same question (see a 19-nation survey by the Program on the International Policy Attitudes, University of Maryland, July 2009). Yet, the resilience of political realism is not only because of the other Great Powers, it extends its long arm inside the Union as soon as the nagging question is asked: who is going to foot the bill? Here the whole of Eastern Europe, faced with budget constraints, is strongly reluctant to finance climate costs in the developing world. However, the clerical-imperial argument still stands out: the participation in the Crusades was a religious obligation, but that did not keep several princes from coming off duty ahead of the rest of the army. 130 Beaud, Theońe de la Fédération , pp. 401-17. © The Authors 2010.

When he ven- tures into those domains he jumps to weird conclusions. For example, in an endnote he gladly espouses Charles Maier's (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) suggestion that 'the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusa- lem and Acre with their "condominized periphery" comes closest to [his] imperial notion of the EU' (p. 198, note 50), which is not likely to make his ideal type so enticing to all the Arabs and Muslims invited to join it. Elsewhere, he makes a bold and unwarranted attempt at regrouping Britain, Russia and the USA, among others, under the rubric of 'Westphalian empires, that is Westphalian centralized states turned empires through military conquests, territorial annexations or international economic exploitation'.132 131 See for example, Michael Mann, Incoherent Empire, London, Verso, 2003; Jonathan Schell, The Unconquerable World , New York, Holt, 2003; James Rosenau, 'The Illusion of Power and Empire', History and Theory, 44 (December 2005), p. 74; Joseph W.

This contention disregards the setting from the very beginning: of federal armed forces including an army waging an ambitious war in 1812, of a navy pursuing the pirates in the Indian Ocean, all claims vindicated by the Supreme Court's Schooner Exchange ruling of the same year, 1812, that asserted the international sovereignty of the federal state over the claims of the member states (in this case, Pennsylvania) to determine the nationality of a ship. Admittedly, there may be more than a kernel of truth in the idea of a 'nation by design' made up by the laws and measures of the federal state and its member states caught between the original 'nativisť view of an 'Anglo-American nation' and the 'capitalist' view of a 'nation of immigrants' (the early Tocqueville praised the first and loathed the second in 1835). We have also to make allowance for Tocqueville's Etats-Unis/Europe , Paris, Fondation Robert Schuman, 2002). Most recently, see the both sober and brilliant A. Glencross, What Makes the EU Viable ? European Integration in the Light of the Antebellum US Experience , New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, one of the most judicious and creative assessments of the EU's institutional perspectives, perhaps because this young author, although holding a PhD from the Florence EUI, is not a card-carrying member of the European circus. 133 Colomer does not make the same blunder and goes the other way in stating that the USA was an empire until the beginning of the twentieth century when, its external limits being fixed, 'the USA was able to complete the institutionalization of internal federal relations between the Union and a variety of states and local governments' (p. 89), not so wrong a view even though it goes too far. In his defence we may note that Zielonka quotes Gianfranco Poggi 's general proposition that in federal states, despite the division of governmental powers between the central state (writing in English Poggi avoids the capital 'S' but it is in his mind) and 'other political entities (some- times called states)', 'historically, however, centralization applies to them too, as a trend in the actual relations between the two levels' (Gianfranco Poggi, The State: Its Nature, Development and Prospects, Cambridge, Polity Press, 1990, pp. 22-3). The seem- ingly mistaken application of the formula to the nineteenth-century USA suits Zielonka fine by proving that a federal option is not available in Europe and thus that the EU as empire is the only way not to be again an imperialist empire. Regardless of the credibility of such a benign view to non-European eyes, it remains to be seen if a federation with a federal state (with a small 's') sharing the sovereignty on an equal footing with member states should always become a federal State (with a capital 'S'). See on this point Beaud, Théorie de la Fédération. Here the gap in the Colomer-Zielonka front is widening, as we shall see later. © The Authors 2010.

O. Key is right, a national public opinion appeared only with the New Deal) - and even with his refusal to set up a national bank that would have jeopardized the president's powers.135 However, we are still bound to emphasize the obvious: 134 See Ari Zolberg, A Nation by Design. Immigration Policy in the Fashioning of America, New York and Cambridge, MA, Russell Sage Foundation and Harvard University Press, 2006. Also Rogers Smith, Stories of Peoplehood.

Letters and Other Writings, New York, Cambridge University Press, 2009. The rulings of the Supreme Court and Tocqueville's judgement seem to me to carry much more weight than the observation that as late as 1892 the USA had very few ambassadors abroad (P. Robin, Enclaves of America. The Rhetoric of American Political Architecture Abroad 1900-1965, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992). When we are reminded 'that it took the United States until the New Deal to give the federal level the kind of competences (regulatory and allocative) that we associate with a "state" today' (K. Nicolaïdis, 'Con- stitutionalizing the Federal Vision', in Menon and Schain, Comparative Federalism, quoting Lowi's contribution to this book, T. Lowi, 'Eurofederalism: What Can Euro- pean Union Learn from the United States', pp. 93-119), one forgets that the original Westphalian state is less allocative and even regulatory than coercive and military. When Lowi (rightly) holds that in 1789 the USA was neither united nor a state, it is for more compelling reasons - among them the weakness of a coercive federal power and the overwhelming influence of the local notables. 135 That rings a bell to contemporary European ears when the central bank is so autonomous that several groups hold that it prevents the EU from making political choices. However, we should not transpose the cleavages of the first half of the nineteenth century into the twenty-first (see Walter McDougall, Throes of Democracy: The American Civil War Era, 1829-1877, New York, Harper Perennial, 2008). The only point worth making is that as early as the 1830s the federal state's powers were growing, it was not Jackson - who opposed it - but the Whig Henry Clay who endorsed federal government intervention in the economy and declared the American people 'entitled © The Authors 2010.

The territorial empires, even when they pretend to spread universal values (' la mission sacrée de civilisation or 'the radiant future of communism'), rely always on invasion, command and submission, in accordance with the pattern of ancient empires, minus the munifi- cence displayed by the ruler to his loyal subjects (although it was to the protecting care of a parental government'. This growth was not due to institu- tional changes but to the formation of the second-party system paradoxically created by Van Buren (to be elected president after Jackson) by taking the slavery issue off the political agenda (see M. Shefter, Political Parties and the State: The American Historical Experience , Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 68; and A. Glencross, What Makes the EU Viable!, pp. 140ÍF). 136 Desmond King, 'When an Empire is not an Empire: The US Case', Government and Opposition, 41: 2 (2006), pp. 163-96. King deals sensibly with a topic too often marred by a combination of soul-searching, indictment, defensive plea and finally advocacy for a stronger American Empire. Rather than quoting once again, say, Irving Kristol and M. Mandelbaum versus Chalmers Johnson and Noam Chomsky, I would recommend returning to two books that have aged remarkably well: Raymond Aron, La république impériale.

If the EU - whose values are, in his (questionable) opinion, not that different from the American ones - were a part of a new kind of empire, not as nice as his own ideal type and closer to the famous Hardt-Negri thesis, a world domination of a universal republic, a network of powers and counter-powers structured by an unlimited and inclusive architecture, and if the USA was just the most visible part of the system140 but not its territorial centre, then the new system would be a decentred and deterritorializing apparatus of rules that progressively incorporated the entire global world within its open, expanding frontiers. The story told by Zielonka should at the very least be modified this way: while the USA was not yet a fully fledged Westphalian state it achieved an imperial territorial conquest 139 In order to set my mind at rest I have to mention a revisionist view of the European expansion in the nineteenth century, marginalizing imperialism replaced by settlerism, the migration of British and other people over the globe to establish free societies in the 'waste' place of the earth, without cutting their ties to Britain (the USA being the exception), sometimes with the aid of state power for protection in their travels and settlings but without a goal of domination and exploitation of a periphery by a centre (James Belich, Replenishing the Earth. The Settler Revolution and the Rise of the Anglo World, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2008). As the book ignores India (there were no settlers in the British Empire's jewel) and more generally considers most European empires in Asia and Africa as a flash in the pan seemingly without far- reaching consequences (he should go to Algeria today), it is both interesting and irrelevant. It has at least the merit of supplying much information on the culture of settlerisms and induces a comparison with the Russian settlerism in Siberia, of which a late offspring in the 1920s was the anti-Westernizers' and anti-Bolsheviks' 'Eurasian- ism' that glorified the Mongol conquest in the thirteenth century, still fashionable in Kazakhstan and in some Russian circles, Muslim or not, not to forget the Turkish brand (M. Lamelle, L'idéologie eurasiste russe ou Comment penser l'empire, Paris and Mon- treal, L'Harmattan, 1999; published in English as Russian Eurasianism.

Note that this empire looks like Zielon- ka's and Colomer's turned upside down and that it has the same enemy, the Wespha- lian sovereign state that all of them deem a thing of the past, replaced in Negri's conception by the indomitable multitude (Hardt and Negri, Empire, and A.

In a second phase it became a non-territorial empire by accident because of its growing economic and military supremacy. Following Carl Schmitťs division between the powers of the earth and the powers of the sea, today extended to the air and outer space but yet not cyberspace, the USA holds what Barry Posen calls 'the control of the Commons'.141 It is still, perhaps only for a short time now (at a very superficial level the gentle, clever and popular President Obama holds no more sway than the nasty, clumsy and despised President George W. Bush), a hege- monial empire brandishing universalis tic values, not fully legitimate yet invited to intervene, and thus liable to develop the hubris of the old ' mission sacrée de civilisation under a wholly new guise.142 Hence the dangerous question arises of whether we should not consider the EU as a post-hegemonial empire faute de mieux , lacking military power, yet with the secret desire to impose on the rest of the world its own weltanschung through the wise use of its economic and technological clout - in sum the continuation of imperialism by other means.143 It proclaims the value of diversity but the would-be diversity 141 Barry Posen, 'Commands of the Commons: The Military Foundations of US Hegemony', International Security, 28: 1 (2003), pp. 5-46. 142 See Ghassan Salamé, Appels d'empire.

Le ' moment américain' au Moyen-Orient , Paris, La Découverte, 2007. As time flies very quickly, those visions seem a bit impaired by mid-2009 but it is wiser not to pass judgement too hastily. 143 The term 'post-hegemonial' is used in a laudatory way by Ulrich Beck and Edgar Grande, Kosmopolitische Europa, p. 85. Magali Gravier takes them to task for postulating an evolutionary process leading from the hegemon to the empire whereas the two terms designate two different kinds of phenomenon. She is right from her point of view since she uses a structural theory of empire borrowed from Alexander Motyl, and in her view the USA is not and never was an empire (M. Gravier, 'The Next European Empire?', European Societies, 11:5 (2009), pp. 625-47). But she misses the point that to the people who adopt the loose definitions provided by Hardt-Negri and Zielonka, the prosecution rests its case, vindicated as it is by Ferguson or, with a vastly different oudook, David Chandler, who demeans the EU as an empire that declines to assume its responsibilities (D. Chandler, Empire in Denial: The Politics of State-Building, London, Pluto Press, 2006. Needless to say, the Balkans loom large in the latter view). Likewise, © The Authors 2010.

Similarly, 'every human being was born a democrat and a free economic agent' and it is up to her free choice to decide to join the Church or the Ummah and to follow her own genius to make the best use of the recipes offered by the Union, which, in return, will not issue direct orders but evaluate the results and pass judgement on the 'orthodoxy' of the new converts. To escape from the trap, Zielonka needs to prove that the EU has a strong but not territorial centre (not a place but a stratum, as Magali Gravier puts it) to which the periphery accedes gradually by becoming a set of places where economic development occurs through the market and the competition between regions.145 It is understood that the territorial units (not always nation states) are preserved - a pressing concern for Colomer, who maintains that Spain is a failed nation state. There is more at stake: what does really matter in Zielonka's view is providing a convincing descriptive and prescriptive picture of the current EU polity as a polity based on a legitimate normative order located above politics, a manifest destiny devoid of any relation to military, economic or cultural adventures in authoritarian expansion. The new empire's identity is not genealogi- cal, mired in the past's dubious ruts, it is teleological, decidedly Herfried Münkler holds that Europe should adopt the imperial model in the future (H. Münkler, Empires. The Logic of World Domination from Ancient Rome to the United States, New York, Polity Press, 2007, pp. 161-7). 144 Among the liberal theorists Michael Walzer squarely rejects this fake universal- ism.

In accordance with its own brand of pacifism that we have defined above, the EU declares peace to all the peoples of good will, it is nobody's enemy and accordingly nobody is, or should be, its enemy. Its constant effort will be to transform the neighbour, this ill-known and thus threatening alien, into a potentially domestic partner, familiar to the anthropologists, a partner with whom the EU will share the full security of a normative regulation.146 Zielonka goes even further and does not miss the opportunity of joining the choir of Huntington-bashers by citing the East European studies that show the overlapping of civilizational borders between Islam, Catholicism and Orthodoxy.147 He could have added that pre-Westphalian Europe was, like Islam, relatively more tolerant in religious matters than the conventional Westphalian Europe.148 He could have pleaded for a new political language freed from the Hobbesian presuppositions and emerging beyond the dis- tinction of the Self and the Other, the Inside and the Outside149 - a combination of medievalism and postmodernism that would suit his thesis - were it not for his equally strong plea for the national economic and social preferences in his chapter on 'Economic Governance'. A note of caution is in order here. In the depths of a polity, within specific sectors or at its civilizational borders, there may be strong ties 146 I borrow this analysis from Ziegmund Bauman, Postmodern Ethics, Oxford, Black- well, 1993. Zielonka does not mention the Polish sociologist and philosopher but, like Michael Keating's cited above, Bauman 's work fits in his overall framework and for once an idealist postmodernity would be relevant to the imperial design.

These sensible empirical descriptions are not unexpected since there are in the modern world very few purely homogeneous societies. Such societies are always more the (too often harmful) dream of ideologists feeding on widespread popular (and populist) prejudices than a true picture of empirical reality. The problem is that it is a feature of modern polities to aggregate the variegated identities into a dominant 'We' supposed to transcend them. We cannot afford to overlook what James Bowen calls scornfully 'the big political dramas' engineered by the politicians and echoed by the media since they are part and parcel of the endless debate about the nature of the 'We'. To ignore them is to betray a hidden political agenda. Besides, the stories of conviviencia should be complemented with no less sensible descrip- tions stressing the enduring influence of those local identities on their very members whose identities are deemed fluid, from the baroque Catholics Ladinis of South Tyrol to the Sepharadic Jewish Ladinos of Slovakia, not to mention the better-known Roms or a part of the 'Muslims' who do their best to resist the move to fluidity, powerfully helped as they are by the various stigmatizations they have to put up with. Put together, they do not suffice to destroy Hunting- ton's thesis (which is questionable only as far as the 'clash' looks inevitable between groupings of which the boundaries are ill- 150 R.

Whatever caveat we may enter against Zielonka's bold statements, he, as well as Colomer in his own way, indeed breathes new life into the first Roman concept of impeńum around 100 BC,151 as legitimate authority disconnected from any idea of a conquering or dominating power, a concept relayed several centuries later by the idea of empire as the immanent bearer of the Universal, 4 the ideal of a new age, the plural and universal gathering of the peoples under the same author- ity, just laws and within the same order of peace and prosperity, of happiness at a mytho-paleogenesic Ievel'.152 One cannot help being impressed by the affinity of this conception, still held in Dante's Monarchia, with the underlying rationale of Zielonka. I do not think he is in full command of the many historical cases (admittedly, that would require an impossible proficiency), which leads him to over- look, or downgrade, the truly important paradox. The Paradox of a Post-Imperialist and Post-National Empire The paradox lies in this: it is risky to apply the model of empire, worked out for either the 'Axial Age' or the 'Age of [mostly colonial] Empires' to either post-Axial or post-colonial times, with their vastly different economies, technologies and politics. The pre-Axial Age, as far as large units are concerned, was the age of god-kings who em- bodied both the cosmic and the earthly order. With the Axial Age new ontological visions emerged and were institutionalized, from 500 BC to the first centuries of the Christian era (and later on under Islam, where they are still alive). The conception included notions of a basic tension between the transcendental and mundane orders, 151 J. S. Richardson, ' Impeńum Romanům : Empire and the Language of Power', in Armitage, Theories of Empire. 152 We should have a look at the seemingly unfathomable works of the specialists in hermeneutical economy: Philippe Forget, 'Herméneutique et grande politique', L'art du comprendre , 10 (June 2001), p. 34; and 'Théorie et puissance.

Hence the clerical idea that the kings (the 'Sword' in Islamic parlance), although responsible for restruc- turing the political order, were accountable before a higher author- ity, be it God or divine law represented by the 'Pen'.153 Incidentally, yet most importantly, that proves that the baroque idea that the Sword and the Pen should be unified de facto and de jure in a single regime of government without any separation of powers between the princes and the clerks was never dominant in most of the religious social polities, except for a short while with the idea of 'Césaro- papisme'; that includes the House of Islam, until the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1920s, after the suppression of the Muslim Caliphate by Ataturk. This model was thrown down as a political order, although it is still greatly relevant in the Muslim world. It partially subsisted almost everywhere as a moral order either god-made or man-made, but still marked by its location above politics (in the last case by a process of 'self-transcendency', as Luc Ferry puts it, to name the moral order of human rights154) . This position justi- fied Montesquieu's attempts to create a new political science founded on the relationship between power politics and moral character. For all their differences Rousseau and Tocqueville took their cue from Montesquieu in that matter.155 153 S. N.

Descartes's ill-famed dualism is hard to kill. The current neo-Darwinists, from D. Dennett to A. Damasio, have spent much time and great skill explaining that apparent discrepancy.

Although reflecting the author's mood and final arguments, the unattractive title is somewhat misleading because it does not give any idea of the subtle and tight line of reasoning of an important Montesquieu scholar. However, its reading should be accompanied with a serious injection of Pocock's historical scepticism towards political philosophy's abridgement of history (on Rousseau and Enlightenment radical ideolo- gies, see J.

If we set apart Joseph de Maistre's famous Du Pape , a fantastic denial issued 30 years after the Revolution (the Scottish Jacobite Andrew Ramsay's denial of the English Glorious Revolution of 1688 in the name of divine monarchy was already a rearguard battle in 1719-21157), only Russia remained the towering exception since, as democratic policy? (K. McGraw and J. Scholtz, 'Appeal to Civic Virtue Versus Attention to Self-Interest: Effects on Tax Compliance', Law and Society Review, 25: 3 (1991), pp. 471-98; D. Braun and O. Giraud, 'Models of Citizenship and Social Democratic Policies', in G. Bonoli and M. Powell (eds), Social Democratic Party Policies in Contemporary Europe, London, Roudedge, 2004). Unfortunately, several micro-sociological studies show that a plurality of motivations coexist in front of a requirement of compliance and that March and Olsen's two logics (appropriateness and utility maximization) cannot be disentangled (P. May, 'Regulation and Compliance Motivations: Examining Different Approaches', Public Administration Review, 65: 1 (2005), pp. 31-44; M. Wenzel, 'Motivation or Rationalisation? Causal Relations between Ethics, Norms and Tax Com- pliance', Journal of Economic Psychology, 26 (2005), pp. 491-508; S. Lindenberg and L. Steg, 'Normative, Gain and Hedonic Goal Frames Guiding Environmental Behavior', Journal of Social Issues, 63: 1 (2007), pp. 117-37). Yet the macro-sociological question raised by Montesquieu is still valid. 156 As John Plamenatz noted long ago in his famous, and criticized, 'Two Nation- alisms', the story holds true first and foremost for Western Europe. Between 1400 and 1800, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth where the Reformation was non- existent, state power was reduced and the influence of the nobility grew so that the commonwealth's role in European developments weakened and the interference of neighbouring powers in its internal affairs grew, the result being the emergence of nationalism not through the state's strength but its weakness (see A. Zamoyski, Poland. A History, London, Harper, 2009, much better on this period than on contemporary times). 157 On the highly confrontational and transformational features of the Glorious Revolution, admittedly less bloody than the French and Russian revolutions, see Steve Pincus, 1688 : The First Modern Revolution, New Haven, CT, Yale University Press, 2008, a reassessment of the role of James II, whose project was to emulate Louis XIV's state, which makes 1688 the victory of one face of modernity, a commercial society, against another, a modernizing state bureaucracy, both of them condemned by Maistre.

Both the liberals and the Roman Catholics strongly disagreed with this, each pursuing their own dream, and in 1914 only Nicholas II still thought that he had a personal covenant with God. With the Hobbesian era, a social polity - as we have called it earlier in this article - was openly superseded by a political society, and modern politics emerged, to Leo Strauss's great dismay.158 The so-called secularization was not this society's first and foremost feature, and religion did not become pluralist (actually it had always been more or less so). Neither did it lose its grip on public life to be replaced by the improbable 'naked public space': eighteenth-century liberal England and nineteenth-century post-revolutionary France were replete with heated religious-political debates. The core charac- teristic was a public sphere governed by the primacy of politics, free from any moral and legal constraint unless it had been consented to by the sovereign. Not that the sovereign was devoid of any morality, but his authority was, in Hobbes's parlance, jure divino , whereas the clerks' University Press, 2008. Also, M. Kishlansky, Monarchy Transformed: Britain 1603-1714 , London, Penguin, 1997. With the benefit of hindsight it seems today that the 'rear- guard battles' of 1720-1830 are making the headlines again, when the Islamist cri- tiques of the Enlightenment, voiced in the 1950s by the influential Said Qutb (executed by Nasser), echo Maistre's and many others' critiques (R. L. Euben, Enemy in the Mirror. Islamic Fundamentalism and the Limits of Modern Revolutions , Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1999). 158 Strauss was not mourning the demise of empire and of its illegitimate offspring, absolute divine monarchy transferring the emperor's status to the princes (the kings' 'original legitimacy comes from History thanks to God or from God through History', Yves-Marie Bercé, Les Monarchies, Paris, PUF, 1997, p. 9). But he would regret the breakdown of the unity of the ontological, moral and political orders, liable to provoke a 'putrefaction of politics' and the totalitarian attempt to create an artificial unity in the name of a would-be 'authenticity', hence its fulminations against Machiavelli, Hobbes and Rousseau. Curiously, I have detected some Straussian flavour in a dire analysis of the post-totalitarian situation where the 'church of civil society' has replaced for a short while Marxism-Leninism: 'By proclaiming that salvation is to be found here on this earth, through improvements in human institutional arrangements, neither [Marxism-Leninism or civil society] is able to connect with the transcendental, with the sense of the sacred, which so many human beings appear to need' ('the soul of the city' strikes again: is a spurious dogma divorced from any sense of the sacred possible in the European 'empire'?

The representation of individu- als is a constant concern of the democratic federalists, especially the republicans who share Skinner's conviction that liberty is today threat- ened by the arbitrary will of an omni-incompetent state.160 We will see 159 Zielonka makes the familiar mistake of taking for granted Hobbes's amorality since his construction is based on the science of the laws of nature, and of indicting Westphalian realism for believing that 'might makes right' and cutting foreign policy from all ethical moorings as if there could be no morality in the state of war (which is questionable at the very least). The first claim is still hotly debated, the main issue being the possibility of morals based on self-interest (Gregory Kavka, Hobbesian Moral and Political Theory , Princeton, Princeton University press, 1986). As for the second, it stands true only as far as certain German theorists from the early twentieth century - including sometimes Carl Schmitt - are concerned; it ignores authors as diverse as Fénelon and Morgenthau, as well as the fact that, for all their dreadful breakdowns, in the first Wesphalian era (1648-1815), wars became less barbaric, particularly for civilians, and in the second one (1815-1939) the first conventions of The Hague were signed. More generally, the idea emerged that the international community needed rules and practices to subject the international game to a measure of rational calcula- tion and control since enough people started to conceive of the domestic polities as associations of individuals and no longer as hierarchical structures endowed with a god-given legitimacy, which strengthened the foedus view of international politics (Tim Blanning, The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture: Old Regime Europe 1660-1789 , Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2003, and Blanning, The Pursuit of Glory). Last, there is no logical connection between realism and the conviction that the ends always justify the means (Noel Malcolm, Aspects of Hobbes, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002, and Reason of State, Propaganda, and the Thirty Years' War. An Unknown Translation by Thomas Hobbes, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007. On the relation to the 'radical Enlight- enment', Jeffrey Collins, The Allegiance of Thomas Hobbes, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2005). Is it far-fetched to recall that Noel Malcolm is also a Eurosceptic? For an overall assessment of realism, see Stephen Walt, Annual Review of Political Science, 2002, and more specifically on Niebuhr, Morgenthau (who ended up advocating a world state) and Waltz, see Campbell Craig, Glimmer of a New Leviathan. Total War in the Realism of Niebuhr, Morgenthau and Waltz, New York, Columbia University Press, 2003. The neo-realists, including Waltz, have maintained their thesis of the impossibility of a world state, e.g. John Mearsheimer, The Tragedy of Great Powers Politics, New York, Norton, 2001. 160 Skinner, Hobbes and Republican Liberty. © The Authors 2010.

Is it possible to revive the imperial commonwealth in a non-theological framework? Would it not be like reviving the efficient natural conservationism of the Itza' Maya in Guatemala (a cooperative way to solve Garrett Hardin's 'tragedy of the Commons') without actually treating the forest resources 'as intentional, relational entities, like friends or enemies' and the 'spirits of the forest' as thinking beings endowed with super- natural powers of knowledge with whom the humans should stand in a relation of reciprocity?161 Can James Lovelock really believe that science can re-enchant the earth when he speaks of Gaia? The solution of the paradox of the revival of empire may follow two paths. First, if the coercive aspect of an empire is stressed, the solution is the denial of such a revival, reduced to a mere pun. This is how Zielonka is usually dismissed, and still more so Colomer, whose definition - however presented as covering all the historical cases - stresses the commonwealth aspect of empire (large size, no fixed boundaries, territorial diversity and multilevel jurisdictions, pp. 3-4) so exclusively that it looks obviously cut out to match the correspond- ing definition of the modern state. Thus Colomer's definition cannot claim to cover all the characters of most empires (his powerful retort is that he uses the term to define not a policy but a polity, thus only his definition is truly universal: all the empires are not imperialistic, nor should they be confounded with dictatorship, but he eschews the theological aspect of an empire162). The second path is: if the com- 161 See the methodologically rigorous work of A. Atran and D. Medin, The Native Mind and the Cultural Construction of Nature , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 2008.

Zielonka makes a perfunctory and awkward attempt at using a post- modern rhetoric, mosdy ignored by the more prudent Colomer since this rhetoric cannot fit into his framework of a rational imperial economic order combined with the self-government of small and homogeneous units (two features the postmodernists hate). Accord- ing to the post-sovereign rhetoric, the transcendental order is replaced by a rational-natural (in Hayek's acceptation, at once cosmos and taxis) economic and liberal order, claimed to be universally valid whatever the variegated cultures it is embedded in.163 Therefore, the clerical-imperial model is confronted with democracy whose achieve- ment, often merely deemed nation-building, looks to be the main goal of the new empire (this is an oddity since nation-building is typically derived from a Westphalian conception). In any case, it has to conjecture the transformation of politics and accordingly the mutation of democracy short of being a mere oxymoron like the republican empire.164 On the other hand, the federal model, which has no such problem since it is firmly rooted in modern democratic politics, has to confront the problem of a federal governance and the problematical supervening of meaningful structuring cleavages at the European level which are the only way to legitimize the asymmetry between members and possibly between them and a federal polity, now considered a tool for federal stability.165 That explains why 163 The denial, as the statement that the use of the concept of empire is an anachronistic fallacy, is represented, among others already cited, byjoseph W.
