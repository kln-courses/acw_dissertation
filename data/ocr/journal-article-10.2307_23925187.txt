<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 1, No. l, March 1987 GOD IN THEORY: MILTON, LITERATURE AND THEODICY Margarita Stocker Theodicy, that which attempts to account for the existence of evil given the proposition that God the creator is good, is necessarily a topic which engages Christians in a crucial argument. For the Christian poet, it seemed to Milton at least, this was the one subject meriting and demanding an epic scale of treatment, the object of Paradise Lost being to justify the ways of God to men' (1.26). It is impossible not to think of Milton when the idea of a literary theodicy is postulated. Although he does not mention Milton or literary theodicy explicitly, Austin Farrer does in Love Almighty and Ills Unlimited suggest a literary analogy for his theodicy which must be seen, in the context of his remarks elsewhere on the 'imagination', as central to his conception of the religious consciousness.1 Farrer's view of literary inven tion would be regarded by modern literary theorists as at least old-fashioned, and, for theodical purposes, irrelevant. By discussing theodicy in the light of literary theory, I want first to explicate this opposition and then to suggest that, nevertheless, modern literary theory may in fact help us to develop the implications of theodicy as they apply to literary form; that this formalism can enable us to clarify the enterprise of theodicy itself; and that theodicy cannot escape the conditions of its own articulation as literature. In this light I shall be examining both Paradise Lost and D. J. Enright's Paradise Illustrated. The purpose of this paper is to provide a critique of Farrer which is also a literary critique of theodicy. The traffic is not one-way, however, for this process is a testing of some aspects of literary theory itself. Although the name of the late Austin Farrer is not generally well known, the works of this philosophical theologian and Anglican priest have aroused considerable interest amongst theologians and philosophers of religion. In recent years several conferences have taken his works as a starting-point for the discussion of issues significant to both disciplines. (The most recent of these was held at Louisiana State University in 1986.) Farrer's publications range from sermons to the abstruser philosophical arguments of Finite and Infinite (1943) and his highly individual accounts of scripture in The Glass of Vision (1948) and A Rebirth of Images (1949). In The Glass of Vision Farrer addressed Mark's gospel as a literary text in a manner which proved controversial at the time, and has continued to provoke discussion amongst © Oxford University Press 1987</page><page sequence="2">MARGARITA STOCKER 71 those literary critics who are interested in the relations between theology and literature. Part of Farrer's appeal is doubtless owing to his peculiar combination of traditional convictions with independence of mind. As John Hick has observed, in his theology "The criterion to which Farrer appeals is rationality ... within the life of faith".2 Similar impulses give rise to his 'note of realism', an insistence upon the interaction of faith with the actual quotidian conditions of life.3 He will not allow that God 'plan(s) for an imaginary virtue we haven't got, he plans for the very men we are'.4 A natural consequence is Farrer's concern for practicality in theology, for its expression in what his editor designates 'the philosophy of action'.5 In the theodicy of Love Almighty this rational realism is evident in Farrer's refusal to deny the actuality of evil (as some of his predecessors had done), and in his concern for the relation of the problem of evil to activity and process. The particular emphases of his work give higher resolution to the fact that perhaps the final criterion for a theodicy, when others are satisfied, should be its utility. We must begin with the classic problems of theodicy, which Farrer acknowledges and attempts to avoid. The theological dangers of theodicy involve the ways in which the attempt to 'justify' God may in fact compromise what is defended: the heresies of Gnosticism and Manichean ism, for instance, which contradict God's omnipotence by dualism; of Leibnitzian optimism, which makes God complacent of human suffering. Then there is an apparent circularity in theodical arguments, since God's goodness is justified on the premise that God is good: all theodicy must return to this premise, as Farrer reiterates. Since, however, the problem of evil arises precisely in the context of belief in a beneficent Creation, his goodness is logically a precondition of the argument. As Farrer is aware, theodicy cannot be conducted except in terms which allow for its context in faith. But literature must encounter readers who are not theists, and literary theodicies are therefore (in our time at least) problematically detached from proper theological discourse. Yet the nature of discourse itself could be construed as a problem for theodicy. Language is, of course, inseparable from the definition of what humanness consists in, equally as for Farrer it reflects godhead too; Man is a talking beast, and in his speech lies his reason. Through reason he shares, however faintly, that truth which is the mind of God, and becomes a copy or reflection of the divine likeness. (106—107) Therefore theodicy itself is a product of language, for as Farrer says language is what brings into being such concepts as justice and love (no). It follows that literary discourse may, for Farrer, equally reflect the talking</page><page sequence="3">72 GOD IN THEORY beast's reiteration of the divine 'truth'. Literature and theodicy are both linguistic constructs, a fact which circumscribes their potential. Our very 'notion of God himself, like all other ideas, depends upon language, for it can be argued that nothing can be conceptualized other than in linguistic terms. The consequent epistemological constraints necessarily limit the enterprise of theodicy. Language controls knowledge. If language is human ness, it cannot describe divinity in other than human terms. To state this in religious terms, if humanness is fallen its language is necessarily reflective of human limitations. Viewed from either end of the proposition, language is at once the condition and the limitation of humanness. When language is used to discuss the problem of evil it exercises a self-reflexive limitation upon the topic, since it must deal with the distance between its conceptual possibilities and those items—like 'godhead', the conditions obtaining at the Creation—which human knowledge, by definition, cannot comprehend. Indeed, 'faith', generally speaking, is that which recognizes the difference between what can be known and what is believed. Naturally Farrer is aware of the constraints upon conceptualization, and that is precisely why he offers anthropomorphic analogies for his theodicy. That theodicy involves a conception of God's goodness as inventiveness, creating a plenitude in which each phenomenon seeks to be itself perfectly, and its consequent perfecting activity creates an endless motion of compet ing phenomena, each intrinsically good. Farrer's notion of God's 'inven tiveness' avoids theodical heresies by allowing that God was free to choose what to invent (his omnipotence) and that created beings, because good in themselves and active for their own good, are equally free of predetermina tion (thus they too choose, and the evils they experience are not imputed to God). God's "powers of invention are inexhaustible. Men also invent... and the process of artistic invention probably casts as much light as anything human on God's devising of the world." (62). In this analogy Farrer adopts a traditional position, derived largely from Neoplatonism, which drew parallels between God the Creator and the human artificer, between the world as God's 'book' and the literary text. That tradition, and its characterization of the 'invention' of literary texts, is precisely what modern literary theorists have challenged most strongly. Literary theory is the investigation of the origins of literature. Farrer rightly insists that theodicy must be properly ontological—that is, investigative not of the Fall but of the Creation itself, of theistic origins, for only thus may the origin of evil be argued. Hence the value of his analogy for God's 'inventiveness', and the fact that its assumptions about literary origins are susceptible to a critique from literary theory. Since, as I have said, literature is a vehicle of Farrer's model of humanness as language, such a critique is not only relevant but necessary. We must begin by exploring Farrer's analogy a little further. If the human</page><page sequence="4">MARGARITA STOCKER 73 imagination aids theological understanding, as Farrer suggests,6 it is also subject to theological difficulties. Faith must underwrite the theodical premise that God is good, but faith itself is not enough (as we have seen) to prevent heretical or self-defeating constructions (like the Manichean argu ment) of theodicy: it is an unreal sanctity which does not clothe itself with common sense ... [in considering the problem of evil] the man of sense [therefore] disciplines his imagination. (181) If in theodicy the imagination cannot be a free agent, then what of literary theodicies, where the imagination must be free to construct fictions? Where, also, the control of common sense over the theodical content must recognize a competing claim for control, from the exigencies of literary form. A literary theodicy must take on board not only those theodical difficulties outlined above, but also the conditions of its own articulation as literature. Since it is precisely the nature of literature—or any artefact—as form which animates Farrer's analogy for God's forming power, we should be conscious of the way in which this idea is a corollary of Farrer's model of 'inventiveness' as a freedom of choice which is also an active, a forming power. In effect, his analogy suggests that 'imagination' and 'control' in literature are analogies for their combination in theodicy itself. As Farrer suggests, language is not merely expressive but active. Indeed, the revelation of'the Word', of God, depends upon its activity; "when the saint speaks with effect to the spiritually unawakened ... mentality ... is imparted, or at least actualised, in being addressed", and thus the Christian life depends upon "a saving action developed in discourse" (123, 128). The literary formalization of this discourse is evident in a work like Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, where for the once unregenerate de Stogumber the martyred saint has 'actualized' the meaning of the Passion: DE STOGUMBER. ... I did a very cruel thing once because I did not know what cruelty was like ... you must see it. And then you are redeemed and saved. CAUCHON. Were not the sufferings of our Lord Christ enough for you? DE STOGUMBER. ... No ... I had ... read of them in books... But it was no use: it was not our Lord that redeemed me, but a young woman whom I saw actually burned to death ... CAUCHON. Must then a Christ perish in torment in every age to save those that have no imagination?7 In fact de Stogumber does not recognize Joan as the woman involved, for it was not she but the enactment of martyrdom, the symbolic action, which redeemed him. For Shaw this play is the imagination's re-enactment of that</page><page sequence="5">74 GOD IN THEORY enactment, an expression of what Farrer called 'saving discourse'. As in Love Almighty, 'imagination' is here regarded as both a spiritual raising of consciousness and (in Shaw's writing) a replication of the creative act. In both cases—Shaw's and de Stogumber's—imagination is regarded as the opponent of evil. However, this is also an instance of the inescapable implications of form in the literary representation of religious conscious ness. De Stogumber was saved not by reading but by seeing: 'books' had no effect upon this unimaginative reader. On the other hand, the spiritual efficacy of enactment implies here the necessity of Shaw's chosen form: drama is not for reading, but itself an enactment. Saint Joan is an instance of the literary conditions of a 'saving discourse'. Those conditions are relevant to all writings, whether these are designated 'literature', 'theodicy', or 'literary theodicy'. Farrer's own Love Almighty is a theodical text, a text aiming for a 'saving discourse', explicating theodicy, and with 'effect' for its reader. These three functions are not separable. This cannot be a 'saving discourse'—that is, a successful theodicy—unless it does 'have effect' (to quote Farrer's own phrase). Form, content, and reception are fundamental to all texts, and hence to theodical texts of any kind. Equally, the 'effect' of a theodical text may, like theodicy itself, go disastrously wrong. To illustrate 'effect', and its problems, we can begin with Voltaire's Poem on the Lisbon Disaster (1756),8 in which he challenged the contention of Optimistic theodicy that 'all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds'. The Lisbon earthquake was an inexplicable disaster confirming the fact 'recognized by all men, that "There is evil upon the earth" '. In the face of this powerful actuality Pope's optimism is an 'insult' to human suffering, the actuality of evil which Voltaire is concerned to reassert. Although it is true that 'Voltaire ... either rejected or made impossibly difficult the language of theism and denied proper theological discourse',9 the poem's revocation of suffering counteracts the essential callousness of Optimistic theodicy, which untheologically implies God's collusion with and indifference to human suffering. Similarly, Voltaire's anger was echoed by Samuel Johnson's reaction to the theodicy of Pope's disciple, Soamejenyns' A Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil (1757). Jenyns' crude statement of the notion that evil is a necessary constituent in the universal system of 'subordination' evokes Johnson's protest that "This author and Pope perhaps never saw the miseries which they imagine thus easy to be borne".10 Because such 'imagin[ing]' is deviant, suppressing human empathy (and hence the problem of evil also), Johnson recognizes a discrepancy between the intention and the effect of Jenyns' text. Evidently Jenyns intended to suggest a comforting theodicy, but its effect is at once illogical and callous. Worse, in reflecting upon metaphysical questions without due regard to the limitations</page><page sequence="6">MARGARITA STOCKER 75 of human knowledge—emphasized by Farrer too—-Jenyns' text becomes for Johnson an instance of 'presumptuous imagination' in imputing its own notions to God.11 In this manifestation of the inherent dangers of theodicy Johnson observed the unfortunate effect of Jenyns' 'imagination' not only upon the author, confirming his complacency, but also upon the reader. In his view all literary texts should (as Farrer's analogy suggests) have an ameliorative function like that of theodicy itself: The only end of writing is to enable the readers better to enjoy life, or better to endure it ... The only reason why we should contemplate evil is that we may bear it better.12 Whereas the ironic effect of Jenyns' Optimistic text is to foster puzzlement and dismay.13 There is an instructive similarity in Rousseau's reaction to Voltaire's poem, which he complained did not merely express the horror of evil but actively 'afflicted' its readers.14 Relating man's character as the 'talking beast' to the nature of original sin, Farrer says that 'Our humanity itself is a cultural heritage; the talking animal is talked into talk by those who talk at him; and how if they talk crooked?' (114). If this is how original sin is inculcated, the process implies a difficulty in Farrer's conception of the 'imagination' as revelatory, for deviant imaginations will 'talk crooked' to their readers. According to Rousseau and Johnson, Jenyns and Voltaire have perpetrated not 'a saving action developed in discourse' but an evil action developed in discourse. If, as Johnson suggests and Farrer's analogy implies, all literary activity can be regarded as having theodical aspects, it is likely to share the intrinsic dangers of theodicy; once theodicies are written they inevitably hazard themselves to the fate of all texts, which is to be interpreted and to have effect. For Johnson and Rousseau as readers, then, the texts of Voltaire and Jenyns by imaginative enaction give the dangers of theodicy effect as evils. In Jenyns' case the literary creation of evils is an ironic effect of an optimistic theodicy, but for Rousseau Voltaire's pessimistic text is equally misaligned, since Rousseau remarks that Voltaire cannot have intended to deny providence. Flere he makes an instructive distinction between inten tion and effect which provides a critique of Farrer's creational analogy. Farrer's suggestion that the writer replicates the divine .creativeness not only ignores the potential deviance of'imagination', as suggested by Johnson, but also unproblematically implies the writer's replication of the divine inten tion. As Farrer himself insists, theodicy properly conducted requires that God intended what he created, and intended that it be good. We have seen that the writer's intention, whether or not beneficent in itself, can be accused of malignant effect. For Farrer's analogy the consequence would be an</page><page sequence="7">76 GOD IN THEORY antitheodical implication that God having created was unable to prevent malignant consequences of his creation: hence compromising those premises which Farrer rightly insists are requisite of any theodicy properly conducted, that God intended what he created, and intended that it be good. His omnipotence and his goodness inhere in the conjunction of intention and effect. An analogy which allowed this conjunction to be challenged would be unworkable for theodicy. This problem is not merely theoretical, avoidable if we simply dismissed Farrer's analogy. On the contrary, his analogy points, as we have seen, to the literary conditions of theodicy itself. Love Almighty is as much a text as a theodicy, because textuality is necessarily the vehicle of a theodicy. In Jenyns' text, then, the problem is not merely a matter of Optimism's theodical deficiency but also a matter of the way that deficiency is enacted as the text's 'affliction' of its reader. That is, the very textuality of theodicy is itself a problem. From Farrer's literary analogy we have been able to posit several principles. First, that there is no simple parallel between divine and human 'creations', world and text; that textuality is a condition of theodicy; and that textuality is problematic for theodicy. It follows that, just as theodicy is an 'interpretation' of the creation—of the world-text—so as a textual phenomenon theodicy too is subject to interpretation by its readers. (There is indeed an analogy between the textual and creational 'readerships'.) The literary disjunction between intention and effect is a matter of interpretation. This fact is what literary theory can clarify and develop. As the investigation both of the origins and of the interpretative possibilities of literature, literary theory in fact parallels theodicy as con ceived by Farrer as the investigation of primordial origins and the proper interpretation of the world-text. The clarifying function of literary theory is indicated by the way in which Rousseau's distinction between intention and effect in Voltaire's poem anticipated modern criticism. The disjunction of intention and effect arises as a problem in the texts we have considered because their readers, and Farrer, assume that intention is important. According to W. K. Wimsatt, this assumption is 'The Intentional Fallacy'.15 Traditional approaches to poetry operate on the principle that the literary 'success' of a text may be assessed according to how far it achieves what the author intended it to achieve. If 'Intention is design or plan in the author's mind' before he begins to write, then One must ask how a critic expects to get an answer to the question about intention. How is he to find out what the poet tried to do? If the poet succeeded in doing it, then the poem itself shows what he was trying to do. And if the poem does not succeed, then the poem is not adequate evidence, and the critic</page><page sequence="8">MARGARITA STOCKER 77 must go outside the poem—for evidence of an intention that did not become effective in the poem.16 In other words, the question of the author's intention has no value in the reading and criticism of literature, for the text itself is the object of enquiry. Because 'it is embodied in language, the peculiar possession of the public', the text 'is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it'.17 It seems, then, that if we accept this account of the inescapable disjunction of intention and effect we would have to dismiss Farrer's analogy for the divine author, since its implication would be that the Creation is independent of God's 'power to intend about it or control it': a defective theodicy. Yet from another angle Wimsatt's definition of the intentional fallacy actually clarifies the nature of theodicy. As Farrer says, the fundamental epistemological difficulty of theodicy is that it must investigate in 'ordial' terms what is primordial. The situation of the theist in relation to the Creation is precisely that of the critic who wants to find out 'what the poem intends to do' when the available evidence is the poem itself; to find out what God was intending to do when the evidence is the created world. In neither case is such an anteriority recoverable; nor, if it could be recovered would it be relevant except in so far as the text-world already evidences it. The difference is, for theodicy, that God's 'intention', although not recoverable, is qualitatively defined by the premises of his omnipotence and goodness, premises 'guaranteed' as it were only by faith. So one must conclude that God's world/text is the only text for which extrinsic evidence is citable. This essential distinction between divine and human intentional ism is what clarifies the anthropomorphic element of Farrer's analogy. The analogy may usefully suggest God's creativity precisely on the basis that it is like human creativity, but unlike human creativity in that it possesses effective intentionalism. In this way we can usefully isolate the difference as well as the similarity in the analogy, and hence account for that in it which is anthropomorphic. Such a distinction prevents the ever-present danger, in theodicy, of allowing an anthropomorphic 'seepage' to compromise God's attributes. But other implications follow from the fact that a text qua language is 'the peculiar possession of the public'. If, as Farrer reiterates, language is humanness, it is necessarily communal, and he and Wimsatt are therefore agreed that it is 'public', available to interpretation. For this reason the text, not the author, is what the reader interprets. Later theorists have revealed the 'anti-theological'18 implications of this view. When Roland Barthes an nounced 'The Death of the Author' he implied also 'The Death of God': Farrer's analogy in reverse.</page><page sequence="9">78 GOD IN THEORY Barthes attacks explanations of texts which are author-orientated, arguing "the necessity to substitute language itself for the person who until then had been supposed to be its owner ... it is language which speaks, not the author ... only language acts, 'performs', and not 'me'".19 This account of the independence of language reflects the linguistic theory of Saussure, who describes language as a system which refers only to itself; language allows no single, unitary appeals to the 'reality' beyond itself, but constitutes its own reality.20 As Derrida develops Saussure's theory, it follows that we have no conception of a 'reality' other than that world which language makes for us. Therefore language can only refer to itself. Let me anticipate objections to the relevance of linguistic theory either to Farrer or to theodicy. Farrer himself is concerned to emphasize the hermeneutics of human investigation of the Creation. Man, once endowed with speech, starts making an inventory of the universe. The speaker, having labelled everything else, labels himself, and becomes an item on his own list. He is now ... a part of the description he constructs. (109) For Farrer man's construction of the world and the self in language is important, for language thus acknowledges 'otherness'. This enables a recognition of others—Caritas, justice—but also recognizes createdness as otherness. The Creation—in Farrer's account, its multiplicity and therefore its goodness—is 'difference', that which distinguishes one labelled thing from another. That labelling, in Saussure's account of language, is defined as the differences whereby a linguistic system distinguishes 'signs' from one another. Each sign is meaningless except in so far as it is defined by its difference from other signs. If we read Farrer's creational hermeneutics in terms of Saussurean theory, the linguistic system does construct and define the 'differences' which are the human conception of reality. We may say that Farrer's account of that difference moralizes it, finds in it the specifically Christian construction of reality. That the theory emphasizes language's disjunction from any 'reality' beyond itself might well help us to understand the disjunction between 'intention' and 'effect', if we acknowledge that theodicy, itself necessarily a linguistic construction, cannot break out of the world of language. We have seen as much, and accepting this is a peculiarly conscious—sceptical— method of accounting for theodicy's dangers, and of (though never, it must follow, avoiding them) retaining a sense of theodicy's construction even as we construct it. Such an attitude would expect disjunctions. It would be suitable to the Christian conception of human limitations in theodicy, for it would account for that limitation as language. If humanness does depend</page><page sequence="10">MARGARITA STOCKER 79 upon language, the encoding of human limitations in the self-reflexivity of language is not only inescapable but (if recognized) useful. Let me anticipate another objection to the sceptical modernity of literary theory, this time as an account of literature. There is now a common belief, inherited from the nineteenth century, that literature reflects life. A simple example is the Hazlitt/Bradley notion of characterization: in Hamlet there is a character called Hamlet who can be described psychoanalytically, exactly as we might psychoanalyze a person we know. Structuralists and poststruc turalists would not recognize this operation as literary criticism. As Terence Hawkes observes: Mass literacy, and an education system firmly based on it, has tended in twentieth century Europe and America to establish and reinforce an equation between literature and life that would have astonished any preceding age.21 The equation between literature and life is a modern critical heresy. The first English statement of literary theory, Philip Sidney's Apologie for Poetry (1595)» actually insisted upon the disjunction of literature from 'reality' because literature 'constructs' reality as something finer than reality could ever be. That is for Sidney the condition of literature's moral status, and, ultimately, its right to exist. Structuralism is not interested in 'moral status', but it reiterates and refines the independence of literature as a language system. And this too is something that Farrer's analogy would have to assimilate, for Christian reasons. It cannot be held that literary intention is capable of replicating the actuality of God's invention; nor that fictions could reflect 'reality', if 'reality' is taken to be what God sees, since man is incapable of such omniscience; nor that any literary theodicy, in particular, could possibly describe the 'reality' of the Creation as God has disposed it. Theodicy, and literary theodicy, are not explanations but constructions; as Farrer notes, no-one can 'explain' the Creation; they can only construct a human—a linguistic—speculation, the terms of which are self-reflexive. The value of Farrer's analogy is enhanced as well as qualified if we juxtapose the contention that books finally appear to portray or reflect, not the real physical world, but a world reduced to other dimensions; to the shape and structures of the activity of writing: the world as a text ... As a result, we tend to 'literarize' all our experience, reduce it to a kind of'book'.22 Indeed, Farrer's account of the hermeneutics of a Christian life precisely reflects the idea that the individual 'reads' what he has labelled, including himself. According to Barthes, it is not the author but the reader who 'makes' a</page><page sequence="11">8o GOD IN THEORY text, by interpretation. The author is not the begetter or father of his text: rather the hand ... borne by a pure gesture of inscription (and not of expression) traces a field without origin—or which ... has no other origin than language itself, language which ceaselessly calls into question all- origins.23 Therefore no text has a definable single or 'ultimate meaning', for it has the many 'meanings' readers make as they peruse it. Barthes regards this 'liberation' of the text from 'a "secret", ultimate meaning' as involving 'an anti-theological activity' because it implies the denial of 'meaning' itself. If we accepted this analysis we would have to abandon Farrer's analogy altogether—and the tradition behind it—for if there are no authors there are no replications of divine authorship and no divine authorship either. Barthes argues that no text is original, 'authored', because all texts endlessly replicate the literary gestures of other texts, and this is also the source of cultural determination. This literature is essentially form not 'meaning'. Equally, a multiphcity of potential meanings follows because the writer can only imitate a gesture that is always anterior, never original ... a text is made of multiple writings ... but there is one place where this multiplicity is focussed and that place is the reader ... a text's unity lies not in its origin but in its destination.24 We have already suggested that, to refine Farrer's model, the point of analogy is precisely its 'difference': that the human scriptor is linguistically and conceptually different from the divine author. The divine author may be conceived in terms of intentionalism but the human scriptor cannot. Therefore, if we take on board Barthes' description of the cultural determination of texts, we could place it alongside Farrer's characterization of sin as culturally and linguistically determined. This would define the limitations of writers and especially of theodicists. Equally, the reader of Barthes could suggest that human scriptors are 'never original', cannot be themselves inventive of origins, because only the divine author was capable of originality properly conceived. It could also be said that the divine originality is a corollary of God's pre-textual view of reality; whereas human scriptors imitate that original gesture in ways that are textually determined. It could then be said that only God, as the sole author, could write a text with 'univocal' meaning. According to Farrer, however, it is the multivocal ity of God's text/creation that is its meaning, for its very principle is inexhaustible inventiveness. In such terms it could be observed that Barthes is mistaken in imagining that a 'theological activity' demands a 'univocal</page><page sequence="12">MARGARITA STOCKER 81 meaning'. Indeed, a peculiar value of Farrer's theodicy is its focus on origins rather than effects, so that there is no fixity of the creative order: rather a continuing play of meaning which is "the inexhaustible inventiveness of divine mercy" (161). Because there is no fixed predeterminative system (as the 'subordination' theodicy would suggest), "God designs more through us, and less ... for us".25 This is the point at which Barthes' emphasis upon the reader helps us to refine Farrer's analogy. The refinement would run something like this. God's text-creation, the original invention, continues in play and is 'interpreted', given meaning, by the individual as a Barthian 'reader'. In Farrer's terms, God makes his text 'through us', the individual's making. Thus literary texts, while endlessly repeating the original gesture whereby God wrote and 'read' his text ('saw that it was good'), would not themselves be original, 'intended' or predetermined of meaning; but readers of his text and theirs would 'make' meaning of them. Equally, as Farrer is concerned to liberate theodicy from predetermination by emphasizing the human repetition of God's 'choice' or inventiveness, so the notion of the reader's invention of the text presupposes its—and his—liberation from 'fixity' or determination. Having suggested this view of textuality's relation to theodicy I want to focus the discussion on that central literary theodicy, Paradise Lost. The history of its controversial reception illustrates precisely the problems, and the potential resolutions, suggested in this discussion. Once the poem was accepted as a classic, reaction rapidly followed. Johnson was (again) the first to notice the 'presumptuous' element in Milton's imagination, remarking those infelicities into which Milton had been tempted solely by his awareness of his own genius—which had motivated his choice of theodicy as his topic in the first place, as the only theme which could 'satiate his appetite of greatness'.26 Johnson also detected a disjunction of intention and effect owing to the poem's 'want of human interest'.27 The effect of reading Paradise Lost is that the reader 'retires harassed and overburdened',28 the opposite effect of that required by Johnson both from literature and from theodicy. Like Voltaire's, Milton's poem as it were 'makes' evil over again. Taking Johnson's hint about the reader's frustrated search for 'human interest', Blake discovered it in Satan, claiming that 'Milton was [uncon sciously] of the devil's party'. In turn this allegation was adopted by modern critics, most virulently by William Empson, who argues in Milton's God (1961) that contrary to his intention Milton revealed the true malignity and cruelty of his God. In this by now clichéd attitude to Milton's text we can see how wide is the postulated gap between his intention and his effect: that he is seen not to have moderated the problem of evil but to have intensified it. More recently, however, critics have followed C. S. Lewis in defending</page><page sequence="13">82 GOD IN THEORY both Milton's text and his intention. Dennis R. Danielson's Milton's Good God (1982) gives notice even in its title of an anti-Empsonian thrust. However, it is especially the defence offered by Stanley Fish which corresponds to the next stage of the critical process, for his view is reader oriented. He argues that (1) the poem's centre of reference is its reader who is also its subject; (2) Milton's purpose is to educate the reader to an awareness of his position and responsibilities as a fallen man ... (3) Milton's method is to re-create in the mind of the reader (which is, finally, the poem's scene) the drama of the Fall, to make him fall again exactly as Adam did and with Adam's troubled clarity, that is to say, 'not deceived'.29 Thus Fish's critical method presupposes intentionalism but also places the process of meaning within the reader-text relation. For Fish the assertion of intentionalism here prevents an erasure of the author, who controls the reading process. By this means the long-supposed 'disparity between intention and execution' in Paradise Lost is sucked back into the ontology of the text, 'becomes a disparity between reader expectation and reading experience'.30 Like Farrer on theodicy, Fish approaches the problem of Milton's text by unravelling it back to the point of origin. If it was Milton's creative intention that we should misread his text, this makes the reader his own critic: Milton consciously wants to worry his reader, to force him to doubt the correctness of his responses, and to bring him to the realization that his inability to read the poem with any confidence in his own perception is its focus.31 To advance this notion towards the next step of the argument I have suggested from Farrer, we would have to abandon Fish's intentionalism, focusing rather upon his reassertion of the text's 'making' in the reader and that this reader is, inevitably, postlapsarian. Then the reader's construction of meaning in the text would come to include a consciousness of his own responses—an interrogation of himself in the process of constructing that meaning. An example illustrating this function is the reader's response to Satan. According to Fish, the reader comes to be sceptical of his own attraction to Satan's charisma. Farrer points the way to the theodical implications of this process when he insists on the Luciferean mythos of evil, observing that such a fiction is a cognitive code: such "stories ... are alive in our emotions"; "Lucifer's sin is only imaginable in so far as it is human ... You will only make a story of him in so far as you humanise him." (146, 135—6). That, of course, is what Milton does, and the critical reception of his Satan is in effect</page><page sequence="14">MARGARITA STOCKER 83 the graph of an evolving recognition of mythos rather than heroic embodi ment. For the reader to recognise the mythos requires that he recognises his 'reading' of the text, that Satan is constructed by the reader because the mythos is 'alive in our emotions'. If, as I have suggested, the reader be regarded as continuously interrogating his own construction of the text, such a view of the interpretation of literary theodicy would at once allow the reader not to be 'afflicted' by the text, and release the 'author' from responsibility for its effect. By dismissing 'intention' we could regard the theodical text as constructed by the reader in terms of that sceptical attitude to himself. This scepticism would then extend to the theodicy that the reader constructs from his reading of the text, so that it would no longer be possible for that text to be considered as 'promoting evil' of itself, nor for its theodicy to be a 'presumptuous imagination'. The reader becomes responsible for the text he has interpreted. Therefore the reader would be as Farrer describes the human being in response to God's 'text': making it, and responsible for his own 'choice'—choice, in the literary context, of meaning. Since, as I have said, textuality and theodicy are inescapably related, such a theory of reading would be cognizant at once of literary theory and of the problems inherent in offering or receiving a theodicy. It must be said that pre-modem texts like Milton's epic do not readily present themselves as materials of the reader's construction. Barthes saw the claims of 'univocal' textuality as a product of post-Reformation individualism, and 'multivocality' as a modem phenomenon. Certainly the 'authoritative' and intrusive authorial voice of Milton's epic appears to deny free reader construction and Fish sees the reading process as controlled by it. According to Derrida, such an achievement of meaning is not really available in texts (or in language) because, in Barthes' words, "life never does more than imitate the book, and the book itself is only a tissue of signs, an imitation that is lost, infinitely deferred".32 In Paradise Lost theodicy is essentially teleological, looking beyond the text's internal setting and its time of writing, to the apocalyptic New Jerusalem.33 Farrer remarked of the nature of theodicy that we cannot do justice to the purpose of God, or balance the arithmetic of good and evil, without mapping the universe, and running our heads against the end of history (184) and this teleological view is necessarily the context of Milton's epic action. In one sense, then, his and any theodicy is constructed on the principle of deferring meaning. The meaning of Creation is invisible, deferred till God gives it an Ending and reveals Himself.34 Actually, faith itself is a recognition of and a commitment to the deferment of meaning. This deferment is crucial to the construction of theodicy: as Farrer</page><page sequence="15">84 GOD IN THEORY continues, "... And yet the further we go beyond the range of our natural sympathies, the less light we can see." (184). Johnson said exactly this of Milton's theodicy, and his criticism of the 'want of human interest' must be seen in this context. However, if we recognize a deferment of meaning as both proper to theodical activity and a condition of textuality, we could regard the many commentaries on Milton's text as its multivocality. In this sense the commenting texts themselves represent a deferment of meaning. Then we could be assured that Milton's theodicy has not that 'fixity' which would be theologically unthinkable too. Regarded in this light, critical studies of Milton are what Julia Kristeva would describe as 'intertexts' of Paradise Lost. Intertextuality, the way texts speak to and echo each other, reflects Barthes' contention that 'a text is made of multiple writings'. In poststructuralism, "the critic creates the finished work by his reading of it, and does not remain simply the inert consumer of a 'ready made' product ... [no] reading is wrong, they all add to the work. So, a work of literature ultimately consists of everything that has been said about it".35 This play of meaning between texts is what, I would suggest, has liberated Paradise Lost to that sceptical multiplicity of reading which denies any unfortunate fixity to Milton's theodicy. In this way the literary text would, qua text, reflect Farrer's postulation of a theodicy which resides in multiplicity, plenitude and openness. What, then, would a twentieth-century text, conscious both of literary theory's postmodernism and of twentieth-century scepticism, make of theodicy? I would suggest that D. J. Enright's Paradise Illustrated (1978) is precisely such a text. As it happens, this is an intertext of Paradise Lost, insisting on that intertextuality not only by echo, parody, and modifications of Milton but also explicitly. In this sense Enright's is an 'interpretation' of Paradise Lost. In the nineteenth poem of the sequence the archangel Michael informs Adam and Eve of the future writing of Paradise Lost and its reception, commenting on the fallibility of readers and on the controversy surrounding the identification of the 'hero'. Michael offers an opinion on this which is evidently unprescriptive. Indeed, many of these poems end with a pregnant silence which insists that no explicit conclusions are offered in this theodicy. Interpretation is invited and teased. The text is conscious that it must and will be construed by the reader, and continuously foregrounds precisely the necessity of such construction. Thus these poems exploit and emphasize the nature of words as signs, their ambiguities and deferral of meaning. The whole action is played out as a drama of signs. When asked to name the creatures Adam proves uninventive (PI,I), whereas this Eve (characterized now in cognizance of contemporary femininism) proves adept at linguistic invention (VI). Throughout the poem the postlapsarian nature of the text is visibly encoded</page><page sequence="16">MARGARITA STOCKER 85 into it, for language itself is the system of knowledge which is the apple. As Adam says, "I think of words, therefore I am" (V). Equally as being visibly constructs itself in the text, so the linguistic play forces the reader's self-conscious interpretation. When the Lord tells Adam "take your thumb out of your mouth" it is remarked that "(Adam was missing his mother)". The pun on 'missing' at once reflects the mythos (Adam was without a mother) and the inescapable Freudianism of the modem reader. The parentheses of the statement visibly encode an explicit interruption of the text by the 'authorial voice', and thus offer it to the reader to judge its apparent authority. This offer to the reader's construction also encodes the Freudianism of the modem 'authorial voice'. This is only one—an initial example in the text's first poem, which indicates the reading process expected for the rest—of many examples of the text's play of meaning, which eludes the fixities, errors and dangers of theodical activity by evidently textualising itself. The problems ofpostlapsarian language, writers and readers are textual activities which prevent any prescriptive or 'univocal' interpretation here. Equally, the Miltonic presentation of Satan as a 'character' is here interpreted as verbal construct. The Miltonic parody in poem IX begins with quotation: "The subtle snake, the fittest imp of fraud", So spoke the Fallen Angel, fond of artful sound, So spoke the Fiend, alliteration's friend. Thus Satan is verbal artfulness, drained of characterization to be made the mythos of 'speaking crooked'. The arbitrary linguistic difference between 'Fiend' and 'friend' is focussed and played upon to encode signs and their interpretation as themselves the system of 'good' and 'evil'. The investiga tion of signs is the theodical interrogation of the Creation, for there is no other mode of interrogation, arid nothing else may be interrogated through language but language itself. So Adam's meditation upon the actuality of evil is in fact a meditation upon signs: "I gave him a very nice name", said petulant Adam. "I called him SNAKE. I even gave him a second name, I called him SERPENT. There's no gratitude in the world, They bite the hand that feeds them." (XXIV) The reader may speculate that giving the snake two names was Adam's mistake, for the duality of signs, like the replications of Satan's alliteration, is</page><page sequence="17">86 GOD IN THEORY a dangerous linguistic hazard. The instability of signs, their arbitrary relation to the signified, is where doubt and multiplicity make for the deferral of meaning. That play of linguistic speculation here interacts with the irony of Adam's complaint, for he too has bitten the hand that feeds him as well as the apple. Indeed, Satan's temptation itself is ambiguous and deferent of meaning. He tells Eve that God "only wants to keep you dumb,/And that's the truth" (X). The ambiguity of'dumb' insists on the text's modernity, that the reader reads 'stupid' as well as 'silent'. The theodical question, "does God oppress the Creation through ignorance?" is implied even as the postlapsarian system that is language implies the absolute identity of knowledge and language. Thus the theodical question, and the temptation which theodicy must interrogate, are offered for interpretation at the same time as the text emphasizes that both the subject and the object of that interpretation are linguistically determined. Knowledge is language is fallenness, but that equation does not add up to a fixity of meaning because its very terms are opened up to a play of speculation. This 'release' of theodicy and its interpretation is precisely conditional upon its necessary limitations— linguistic and therefore epistemological limitations. The release from inter pretative predetermination is also a theological release from the problems of theodicy. This avoidance of theodical problems is especially evident in the text's continuous exuberance. One example must suffice. In Paradise Lost the last two books portray world history after the Fall in a manner which might well 'afflict' the reader—the vision certainly horrifies Milton's Adam. In Paradise Illustrated that vision is treated with the same playfulness as the rest, a verbal dexterity and wry irony: Enoch died untimely, he was only 365. Certain angels got physical. There was wickedness in tents. (XXVIII) The humour here is not discontinuous from the wry, because knowing, utterances of Enright's God. This implies the theodical value of such literary devices, that they not only forestall a reader's 'affliction', but also liberate the text from the possibility of treating postlapsarian evils as any more or less than anything else in the text. Like Satan, Adam, or Milton himself in this text, these parodie statements interrogate themselves. And their ludic sense of sin retains for the text a premise similar to that of theodicy itself. While theodicy requires that the Creator is beneficent, so the text requires an everpresent enjoyment—a form here of what Barthes calls 'textual pleasure'. The text's exuberance prevents afflictive effect, even as it liberates meaning.</page><page sequence="18">MARGARITA STOCKER 87 Paradise Illustrated interprets in Paradise Lost the 'textual pleasure' which Johnson discovered in Milton's 'imagination': Milton's delight was to sport in the wide regions of possibility ... He sent his faculties out upon discovery into worlds where only imagination can travel, and delighted to form new modes of existence ... When he cannot raise wonder by the sublimity of his mind, he gives delight by its fertility.36 Yet, as Johnson also recognised, Milton is not truly 'original' because intertextual—of Homer and Virgil.37 In Paradise Illustrated, intertext not only of an intertextual Milton but also of Milton criticism, we can see how the literary gesture endlessly replicates itself, the continuous liberation of meaning. If theodicy, speculating rather on origins and ends, nevertheless cannot achieve 'anteriority' to the text of Creation, then this textuality is its analogue. The postmodern liberation of meaning through intertextuality, irony, and wordplay can formalize a theodicy such as that suggested by Farrer's postulation of God's 'inexhaustible inventiveness', without attempting in any sense to prescribe or contain it. In this light the literary text's endless deference, postponement of meaning, would be deferent to God. But, equally, the reader's construction of and pleasure in the text is that human invention or 'choice' which liberates individuals as well as texts from predetermination. The 'choice' or difference in language is also its deferral: at once a literary and a theodical necessity. The world would be God's text but also a human text; Enright's God is a reader of the human being as book, but his human beings are makers of their book.38 In his parody of Milton's epic ending, which is also the beginning, "The words were all before them, which to choose".39 REFERENCES 1 Love Almighty and Ills Unlimited (London, 1966): references in the text are to this work.
