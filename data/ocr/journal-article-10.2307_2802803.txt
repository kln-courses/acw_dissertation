<plain_text><page sequence="1">FETI SHI SM* RoY ELLEN University of Kent at Canterbury The concept of fetishism in anthropology, Marxism and psychology is examined as a particular case of the interplay between theories of cognition and collective representations. Classificatory end-products to which the word 'fetish' has been applied cannot be understood simply as special kinds of objects, or defined in terms of their generic functional attributes. Neither do they reflect a particular mental condition. Rather, they reveal a variable combination of three underlying features of categorisation and representation characteristic of all thought. These are concretisa- tion, animation or anthropomorphisation, conflation of signifier with signified, and an ambigu- ous relationship of control between person and object. All lie on a processual continuum which begins with the identification of categories, relationships and phenomena, and proceeds-via reification and iconification-to their personification. In this sequence what we might loosely describe as 'fetishisation' appears with a shift from the balanced simultaneity of signifier and signified towards 'the thing in itself'. During the last decade analyses of the various connexions between cognition and collective representations, mind and culture, and between 'mundane' and 'symbolic' classifications, have all received a certain degree of prominence in the professional anthropological literature. In contrast to some writers (e.g. Bloch I977; 1985), my own view is that the interrelationships between these apparent opposites as evident in particular substantive cases are often far from clear (Ellen I979; I986b; cf. Harris &amp; Heelas I979). Here I wish to make the point a little more forcefully in relation to the concept of fetishism, and hope to show that this perhaps rather unlikely choice is not as strange as might first appear. I begin by discussing the historical origins of the concept and its three principal analytic traditions-anthropological, Marxist and psychological. Although a handful of recent ethnographic studies have used the notion of fetishism (and I shall refer to some of these below), all can be placed in one of the three traditions. Only Pouillon, to my knowledge, has attempted to review the field with the aim of adopting a more synthetic approach (Pouillon I975 (I970)). There are certain parallels between our positions. The intellectual history of a concept (a) The anthropology of religion. The term 'fetish' is derived, along with its cognates in other European languages (Haddon I92I: 66-7; Tylor I878: I35), *The Curl Lecture, 1987 Mall (N.S.) 23, 2I3-235</page><page sequence="2">2I4 ROY ELLEN from the Latinfacticius, meaning 'to do', or in the passive 'a thing made by art'. By the late fifteenth century it was being applied widely to charms.1 The earliest English forms of the word (O. E. D. (iv) I 93 3: I 76) are directly adopted from the Portuguese feitifo (used in Portugal itself to refer to amulets and the relics of saints). The Portuguese extended its application to certain objects venerated by inhabitants of the Guinea coast, and it was through this channel that it entered scholarly dogmatism, probably during the second half of the eighteenth cen- tury. In this context its use was popularised by the first president of the Dijon parliament, Charles De Brosses (I972 (I760): Io, i8; Tylor I924 (I87): I44). De Brosses had in mind the worship of stone figures and other material objects -the 'stocks and stones' of a later generation of evolutionists-and believed that the savage mind required some kind of tangible object to focus upon, and that only later could the abstract and animate be comprehended. De Brosses regarded religion as having originated in fetishism and his views were widely accepted until the mid-nineteenth century. The concept obtained even greater currency through Comte's use of it to denote a particular theory of religion, in which human mental qualities were attributed to non-human bodies. For Comte (I893 (I830-I832): 2, 545-8) fetishism constituted the first of three stages in the development of religious ideas: fetishism &gt; polytheism &gt; monotheism. It was the first great epoch in human thought in which 'the primitive assignment of passion and will to the most inert forms of nature led almost spontaneously to the assignment of deities to the inanimate and to the animate', and generally to the development of polytheism and organised religion (Voget I975: 2I7). In such a scheme, fetishism represented individual- istic rather than organised religion, and to a large extent corresponded to what later writers would describe as magic. The Comtean framework was widely adopted and, in someinstances, refined. Lubbock (i870: I19), forexample, with the fervour of an evolutionary typologist, placed it as the second of a succession of no less than five invented stages which had to be passed through before reaching polytheism; somewhere between atheism and totemism. We hardly need concern ourselves with the definitions of any of these, other than fetishism, which for Lubbock was that stage 'in which man supposed he can force the Deity to comply to his desires'. Tylor (I924 (I871): I53) rejected Comte's use, preferring to call the attri- bution of human mental qualities to the inanimate animism, while restricting fetishism to the doctrine of spirits embodied in, attached to or conveying influence through certain material objects. Thus, spiritual beings worked through fetish objects, and objects were to be distinguished from spirits. His description of the 'maraca' or ceremonial rattle, used by certain Brazilian peoples is a good illustration of this. He tells us that the fetish: was a calabash with a handle and a hole for a mouth, and stones inside; yet to its votaries it seemed no mere rattle, but the receptacle of a spirit that spoke from it when shaken; therefore the Indians set up their maracas, talked to them, set food and drink and burned incense before them, held annual feasts in their honour, and would even go to war with their neighbours to satisfy the rattle-spirits' demand for human victims (1924: 154). But even during the latter part of the nineteenth century the concept of fetishism was coming in for criticism, and the reports on which the secondary</page><page sequence="3">ROY ELLEN 215 authorities relied were often of a highly questionable kind. For Robertson- Smith it was 'merely a popular term, which conveys no precise idea, but is vaguely supposed to mean something very savage and contemptible' (I884: 209). Haddon (I92I: 64) was derisive of its sloppy application to virtually anything connected with West African religion, and he is particularly critical of the way Mary Kingsley and R. H. Nassau-the chief authorities on the subject in his day-used the term. Nevertheless, he was prepared to justify a more specific definition, namely the worship of 'an intangible power or spirit incorporated in some visible form' (I92I: 70), while remaining broadly Tylo- rian in his use of it for a stage in religious development. Even Frazer (e.g. I922 (I925): 234) appears to assign no particularly distinctive role to the notion, using it as a vague synonym for things magical or religious. With the demise of evolutionism there seemed even less justification for a general concept of fetishism. Evans-Pritchard (I965: 24) is disparaging and dismissive of its employment as an evolutionary stage on the grounds that fetishes are not found everywhere and in particular are not characteristic of very primitive peoples. By this he had in mind food-gatherers. Part of the problem was that particular writers insisted on defining fetishism in terms of particular local manifestations with which they were familiar, but which differed slightly from the usages of other writers. For Nassau, writing in I904 (I969 (I904)), a fetish is a local residence for a spirit, and can be thrown away afterwards. He advises us that it is 'best to limit the word to the worship of natural objects revered not for their own power, but because they are occupied by a spirit' (I969: 8i). But although anthropologists spent much effort criticis- ing the misuse of the term 'fetishism' amongst others, they were, all the time, missing one of the main features of objects described in this way, namely that there tends to be an inner ambivalence as to whether it is the objects themselves which effect material changes in some mysterious way, or whether it is some spiritual force which is either represented by or located in (but separate from) those objects. I shall take up this important point later. With such abundant conceptual confusion, in addition to the indiscriminate application of the term to primitive religion in general, it is no wonder that anthropologists began to avoid using the term. Increasingly, if referred to at all, fetishes were bracketted with charms (Lowie I934: 30I) (see footnote i), while the word survives as a designation (usually untheorised) for certain kinds of art-object in catalogues of ethnographica and in museum labels. An exception in this tradition is Robert Brain, who in a recent book on African art uses fetish in a quite specific sense to refer to 'machines': fabricated by the diviner or sorcerer of various materials and medicines in order to draw upon the immanent life-force of these substances. The sculpture itself may be of minor significance, the fetish being activated by the diviner or sorcerer by performing appropriate ceremonies and incantations over the symbolic paraphernalia attached to it (Brain 1980: 208). Thus, among the Bangwa of Cameroun fetishes are objects used as part of a divinatory technique to protect individuals from attacks of witchcraft, objects which receive power from the medication of a ritual expert. Apart from such usages, and the conceptually explicit applications which I shall now go on to</page><page sequence="4">2I6 ROY ELLEN discuss, the term is occasionally used in a vague, rather deprecating, sense: as in 'the fetishism of reality'. Frankly, I find such phrases quite meaningless, and will not consider them further. (b) Marxism. Marx first introduces the concept of fetishism in a short piece published in the Rheinische Zeitung (issue I93) for I842, having read De Brosses on the subject earlier in the same year.2 It occurs again in The economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 (Marx I977 (I844): 89, ii6) in a context which very much suggests that it matches, and was reinforced by, the use of the same term by Hegel (I975 (I830): i8o-i, I89, 2I8-I9). However, the notion of 'the fetishism of commodities'-as a specific instance of a more general fetishism of property-was not fully developed until Das Kapital, where Marx defines it as where a definite social relation between persons assumes 'the fantastic form of a relation between things'. Here Marx deliberately draws an analogy from religious discourse, one in which the 'productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relations both with one another and the human race'. 'This', he says, 'I call fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour, so soon as they are produced as commodities, and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities' (Marx I970 (I867): 72). Thus, the appearance of value conceals its real nature, while once a commodity plays the role of value equivalent to any other commodity it immediately seems as though it possesses in itself the ability to measure the value of other commodities. It is hardly surprising that in the neo-Marxist resurgence of the seventies it was anthropologists in particular who struggled with the notion of fetishism (Friedman I974; Godelier I970; I977), stressing the central place of religious forms of ideology in Marx's conceptualisation of history (Godelier I977: I76). The problem for a Marxist theory of fetishism, however, is that the principal relation of production (capital) might be at the same time an illusion (Friedman I974: 32-3). For Friedman, the earlier 'idealist' and the later 'materialist' interpretation has led to certain ambiguities in Marxist usages. Following the mature Marx, he claims that 'capital is fetish because its internal properties do not correspond to the function it performs in the material process of reproduc- tion, not because it is a deformed image of that process' (Friedman I974: 43). Balibar (I973) rejects Marx's concept of fetishism as ideological, and distin- guishes commodity fetishism from capital fetishism, in an attempt to expurgate all traces of non-materiality from the relations of production (Friedman I974: 52). Friedman criticises Godelier for displaying the same ambiguity found in the writings of Marx (p. 53), pointing out that 'the problem with the term is that "a fetish" always seems to be the end product of the process of fetishisation, a misrepresentation of some other object or situation, i.e. a deviation phe- nomenon'. This is where the problem lies in resolving the contradictions in Marxist conceptions of fetish. Friedman himself(I974: 59-60) regards fetishism -or at least did so when he wrote the article-as the dominant structure of social reproduction, inevitably contradicting the biological capacities of the species. The Marxist concept of fetishism has been little used in the analysis of specific</page><page sequence="5">ROY ELLEN 217 ethnographic materials. Friedman (I974) uses it in his explications of Firth's Work of the gods and Leach's Political systems of highland Burma (Friedman I 979); it is implicit in some of Godelier's work on the Baruya (Godelier I977). Its most extended and successful application, however, is arguably found in Michael Taussig's The devil and commodityfetishism in South America. Taussig looks at the image of the devil among proletarianised rural people in Colombia and Bolivia, which he claims mediates the conflict between precapitalist and capitalist modes of objectifying the human condition. This image can be interpreted as an indigenous reaction to the supplanting of one form of fetishism by another, and is one which permits envisioning the bonds between persons in their contemporary economic activities for what they really are: asymmetrical, non-reciprocal, exploitative, and destructive of relationships between persons (Taussig I980: 37-8). One manifestation of this is as follows (I980: I26): According to the belief in el bautizo del billete (baptism of the bill) in the southern Cauca valley (Colombia), the god-parent-to-be conceals a peso note in his or her hand during the baptism of the child by the Catholic priest. The peso bill is thus believed to be baptized instead of the child. When this now baptized bill enters into general monetary circulation, it is believed that the bill will continually return to its owner, with interest. . . . The baptized bill receives the names-the 'Christian name'-that the baptismal ritual was meant to bestow on the child. It is not commodity fetishism since these people do not consider it to be a natural property of money to reproduce. Indeed, it is seen as so unnatural that supernatural power has to be invoked by the most devious and destructive means. Marx had long before noted that the fetish character of money varied with social conditions, distinguishing (for example) the veneration of precious metal coinage from general commodity fetishism (Marx I977: I i6). There is an echo of this pluralist view of fetishism in Taussig (I980: 3 7), for whom: the fetishism that is found in the economics of precapitalist societies arises from the sense of organic unity between persons and their products, and this stands in stark contrast to the fetishism of commodities in capitalist societies, which results from the split between persons and the things that they produce and exchange. The result of this split is the subordination of men to the things they produce, which appear to be independent and self-empowered. (c) Psychology andpsycho-analysis. In the psychological literature fetishism refers to the use of a non-genital object to achieve sexual gratification, or an erotic attachment to inanimate objects or ordinarily asexual parts of the human body.3 The term was first popularised by Richard von Krafft-Ebing (I894), though it had earlier been employed by Binet (I887: I43). Apparently, Binet had in turn picked it up through his reading of Rousseau, Darwin and contemporaneous ethnography. Thus defined, such behaviour usually begins in adolescence, though it may (particularly in Freudian theory) have its origins much earlier in infantile experiences and obsessions. It is generally regarded as normal in heterosexual pre-marital sex lives, and only when contact with the fetish becomes an end in itself is the condition considered pathological (Anon I975: II4-I5). The sexual goal is the body part (a hand, an armpit or a buttock), body products, items of clothing (frequently shoes and items of female under- clothing), fabrics (fur, leather, rubber), even inanimate objects such as collar studs and safety-pins (Gosselin &amp; Wilson I980: 43-4). Fetishes may, therefore,</page><page sequence="6">2I8 ROY ELLEN have no direct association at all with the body. In its psychological sense, fetishism is generally thought of as being highly gender-linked and culture- bound. It is rare in females, and although not restricted to European and Euro-American societies as suggested by Gebherd (I976) in its usual sense is not well-documented elsewhere. It has been suggested that the Chinese custom of mutilating the female foot and then revering it exhibits some of these classic features (van Gulik I974: 2 I6-22, 253, 265). The Freudian definition and explanation is altogether more specific. In his essay on the subject (Freud I977: 35I-2), Freud describes fetishism as the 'after-effect of some sexual impression, received as a rule in early childhood'. The fetish stands-he argues-for the missing penis of the woman. Thus, foot and shoe fetishism reflects the inquisitive desire of young boys to approach a woman's genitals from below-from her feet upwards-whereas fur and velvet fetishism becomes a fixation on pubic hair. By comparison, underclothing crystallises the moment of undressing-the last moment in which a woman can still be regarded as phallic (I977: 355, 357). In later essays on the subject, Freud argues that fetishism involves disavowal of sexual difference: the fetishist both acknowledging and not acknowledging this difference by use of the fetish to stand in for the missing penis (Freud I964 (I940)). Winnicott (I974: ch: i) sub- sequently assimilated this idea to that of the 'transitional object'. Fetishism as a category and the fetishisation' of categories There are, therefore, three main scholarly traditions which employ a concept of fetishism, and-strikingly-these relate respectively to three principal spheres of human activity: religion, economy and sex. They might be characterised individually as follows: i. Anthropological (specifically, intellectualist-evolutionist): in which an object is believed to be a spiritual force in itself: the result of malthought; 2. Marxist: in which an object takes on a fixed quality that conceals its true economic function: the result of mystification; 3. Psychological: in which a part (or an associated artefact) replaces the whole as an object of-usually sexual-desire: the result of repression or 'disavowal'. Occasionally, ethnographers have fused two of the meanings: the erotic and the religious, for example (e.g. Herdt I982),4 or the religious and the Marxist (as in the work of Taussig). I know of no analysis which has combined fetishism in its sexual and Marxist senses, though it is what we might expect to find among social Freudians in the tradition of Wilhelm Reich. On the whole, there has been a reluctance to go beyond these separate, though overlapping, senses to explore what it is they might have in common. Of the main differences, apart from the major substantive function of the concept in each case (religion, sex,.economy), the only one which need detain us is the extent to which each operates at the individual or social level. The Marxist notion of fetish is unambiguously social-the general and objective result of collective experience. The psychological usage is for the most part individualistic,</page><page sequence="7">ROY ELLEN 219 though Reich might have envisaged it operating at a collective level. The anthropological usage is ambiguous, for while for the intellectualist it reflected an aberration in individual thought, and functioned-like magic-essentially as 'individualistic religion', fetishes may have collective devotees or their worship may be socially organised. My particular interest in fetishism arises precisely because it is a concept which enables us to focus our attention on the articulation of individual cognitive process and the structure of collective representations. Of the similarities, only one, it seems to me, must be rejected: this is the idea that fetishism is intrinsically aberrant or reflective of a primitive mental con- dition. In all three cases fetishism is regarded not merely as abnormal behaviour, but dysfunctional, pathological and deviant; that is, it is defined partly in moral terms. Early anthropological uses, in the context of evolutionism, inevitably impute inferior mental powers. Karl Marx talks of 'perversion' (Marx I970 (I867): (3), 806), and Godelier (I977: i6) echoes the master when he speaks of a 'fetish to exorcise' and a 'myth to destroy'. Binet's construction of the concept in psychology was explicitly as a 'separate perversion', and in Freud its pathology is transparent. I contend that this is a fatally misleading way to approach the more general (or, as I would prefer, partial) phenomenon of what in the past has been designated 'fetishism'. This does not, however, entail any rejection of the possibility that fetishism-as with any mode of apprehending the world -cannot become 'pathological', either in the sense that its cultural distribution is statistically limited, non-standard and negatively valorised socially, or in the sense that it may threaten the dominant structures of social reproduction. I wish here to identify four general underlying cognitive processes at work in the generation of those cultural representations (objects or phenomena) which have been labelled 'fetishes', and which are all present-explicitly or analogously-in the three main historical traditions.5 These are: i. a concrete existence or the concretisation of abstractions; 2. the attribution of qualities of living organisms, often (though not exclusively) human; 3. conflation of signifier and signified; 4. an ambiguous relationship between control of object by people and of people by object. These processes, in whatever combination, are not confined to particular kinds of society, primitive or bourgeois; or to types of theoretical paradigm, or to fields of substantive investigation. Thus, I reject-with Pouillon (I975: II5-I6)-the idea that fetishism represents a distinct mode of thought, and hold with him and Evans-Pritchard (I965: I05), a view confirmed by his Nuer fieldwork (Evans-Pritchard I956), that whatever it is may co-exist with other different kinds of belief. There is nothing about it which requires that it be treated as a completely separate type; and certainly it does no good to banish it to the realm of the exotic. By including here examples from historical and near contemporary European sources I hope to emphasise more effectively the universal human character of fetish-like behaviour and avoid its relegation to some primitive ethnic 'other' To claim that a term and definition devised during a period of intellectual</page><page sequence="8">220 ROY ELLEN history whose typologising proclivities have been much discredited should now be re-thought is perhaps not very radical. Legitimate comparisons can be made with other attempts to deconstruct analytic categories invented by those convinced of their moral and mental superiority in order to distance the mind of some primitive 'other' from that of a European 'self'. One thinks, for example, of mana, taboo and-particularly-totem (Pouillon I975: I05). Fetishism, like totemism, has over the years emerged as a confusing hydra. In order to tame the beast it is necessary to lop off its many heads and begin to re-constitute its conceptuality. It will, therefore, come as no surprise that I should at this point take my inspiration from Levi-Strauss (I962) and ask 'of what greater whole is fetishism a part?' In such an exercise we must not expect the boundaries of the concept to be drawn in the same way as in its previous incarnation, and indeed we may conclude that no firm boundaries can be drawn at all. Concretisation It will be evident from the previous discussion that, in principle, the notion of fetish can refer to almost anything, a characteristic which the earliest writers were well aware of (Lubbock I 870: I96; Tylor I924 (I 87I): i68, 302). It may not be an object at all, but rather an abstraction which is treated as if it were. It may be a culturally unmodified, modified or only minimally modified natural object, including such diverse items as bundles of sticks (as in Nuer kulangi (Evans- Pritchard I956: ioo)), the celebrated Kongolese nail fetishes, bodily relics of saints, the icons of eastern orthodox Christianity and the Marian images of the western Church). But whatever its physical status, concretisation or objectifica- tion of representation is an intrinsic quality, and a process which we must now examine in further detail. It is instructive to approach the idea of concretisation by considering the case of the most elementary categories which we can identify ethnographically. Such elementary representations (not to be confused with Durkheimian elementary forms), consist of those categories least affected by feedback loops from more inclusive and complex levels of cognitive abstraction. They are sometimes called 'percepts' and we can infer their existence from empirically verifiable variation in the semantic and morphological construction of categories in a single culture as revealed through ethnography; from the changing character of categories (often through the accretion or deletion of meanings, and the growth of more complex classificatory and social environments) as shown historically; and also from the development of categorisation in children evident from work in developmental psychology. Elementary representations and the structures created from the relations between them may be transformed into complex symbolic representations in two ways. The first is by increasing abstraction. An example of a string of increasing abstraction would be in folk biological taxonomies: buttercup &gt; herb &gt; plant; or in the social realm: individual person &gt; family &gt; clan &gt; society &gt; humanity. In the second, elementary representations are transformed by compression, or condensation, of meaning or cultural value on a single item or relationship. An example of such compression of meaning would be in</page><page sequence="9">ROY ELLEN 22I increasingly abstract ideas being associated with a single object: monarchy represented in the body of an individual person, nationhood expressed in terms of a single animal, saintliness in terms of the dried viscera of a long-deceased holy person, and so on. Abstract symbols (often the most abstract) may be turned into icons (often the most concrete) through a process of objectification, and these end-products may be either physical icons (Ohnuki-Tierney I98I: 458) or 'thingified' verbal signs (cf. Pouillon I975: I I9). Thus, the concept is no longer simply in the minds of people but it exists in the external world, culturally transmitted independently of the existence of individual persons. Such objectified concepts-in which we must include fetishes-are therefore treated like other sense images. A good illustration of how this process of concretisation may operate at different degrees of categorical inclusiveness is with respect to the concept of natural kind. Ethnobiologists, in their attempts to compare different systems of classification and understand the processes of category formation, acquisition and evolution, have sought a cross-cultural concept of natural kind.6 It would be highly convenient if all cultures operated with a species concept comparable to that in Linnaean taxonomy, which could serve as the basic building-block of classificatory systems. But although different workers agree that all peoples behave as if they recognised a basic level of categories, this sometimes appears to be at one level, and sometimes at another. It is now recognised that basic categories can be utilised at different degrees of inclusiveness, sometimes equivalent to phylogenetic species, sometimes to genera, sometimes to families and sometimes to entire phyla; and this may vary within cultures, within the same domain or between domains, and according to context, as well as between cultures. In small-scale societies, basic categories of, for example, animals are more likely to be gestalts, clusters of features verging on a general prototype, at the generic-specific level, while in industrialised and literate cultures (which are more detached from the world of plants and animals, and who mediate through abstract secondary representations) they are more likely to be generalised categories, distinguished on the basis of a few distinctive features. Part of the problem faced by ethnobiologists was that they were narrowly comparing Linnaean taxonomy with particular folk animal domains, and not looking at language more broadly. For the concept of natural kind is really no different from categories which we apply to people. Both conceptualise groups of generically-related objects as things and that 'thinginess' must be understood as an acceptance that, at least for some purposes, they should be regarded as having a kind of objective existence, like individual unique objects (this stone, this individual bird) and so on. It is not so much that such master concepts as species, genus or phylum are an 'internal transformation from human social relations' (Durkheim &amp; Mauss I963 (I9OI-2); Dwyer I976: 434), which they may sometimes be in terms of the imagery of representation, but that there is a generalised propensity in all human classifying behaviour, to reify through concretisation, to treat the most complex of abstractions as things. Even entire classifications-the word 'classification' itself deceptively conveys somewhat more than just a penumbrum of 'thinginess'-acquire a false objectiveness through our insistence on a model of two-dimensional multi-levelled</page><page sequence="10">222 ROY ELLEN hierarchies. Moreover, by turning abstractions into things we compound the illusion that categories (natural kinds of cultural entities) exist independently of other categories. Another route to objectification is through our attempts to represent social relationships. Those items which we subject to any kind of exchange, either concrete items (such as food), notional ones (such as credit transfers), or-as in most cases-a mixture of the two, almost always serve to 'thingify' a rela- tionship. A gift given, as Mauss tells us, is inevitably a relationship between persons; a square metre of land owned implies and requires a relationship between owner and non-owner. In contemporary Euro-American culture and its global outliers, this kind of language of things routinely masks the complex- ity of real-world social relationships, by some sleight of thought making what is sociologically recondite pragmatically pellucid. Consider, for example, the rather special (but nevertheless much-discussed) case of the creation of 'fictional' commodities. In Marxist terms, these involve the transformation of production relations into entities, the most familiar of which is money (Marx I970 (I867) 3: 8o0-io). Whether interpreted as a logical or historical process, this may be analysed in terms of the five-stage sequence illustrated in table i. TABLE i. The process of de-objectification and re-objectification by which 'fictional' commodities are created. i. objects C 2. exchange of individual objects C - C 3. objects come to represent other objects in exchange relations C - C C 4. signs are adapted to represent objects in delayed exchanges C M &lt;* C 5. signs become relfied as real things which underpin the economy M&lt;-* C &lt; C Money (or capital) qualifies as a fetish in all this because it is seen to 'objectify' transactions and reduce them to a single physical medium. Although it is conventional to exemplify this in terms of the secular economy it is hardly surprising that once any idea has been in some way objectified it will, under the appropriate economic circumstances, become commoditised. One thinks, for example, of the trade and theft of saints' relics in mediaeval Europe (Sumption I975: 3I), the purchase of votive offerings to images (Christian I98I: 93), the marketing of nkisi figurines among the Kongo (Brain I980: 2IO), or kulangi among the Nuer (Evans-Pritchard I956: ioo) during the present century. Indeed, in the form of indulgences, consecrated offerings and the like, the payment of money in return for divine help signifies as clearly as anything the transactional character of the relationship. The turning of ideas into objects inevitably involves an element of separation, decontextualisation or externalisation (Taussig I980: 460, following White- head). As society finds it necessary to deal with notions of increasing abstracted- ness by objectification there is a propensity to ignore the wider setting from which they are derived. The creation of a category for a particular animal separates it from other species which are regarded as different though compar- able and related species; the recognition of a particular classification cuts off a general repres ntational device of cognitive relations from the particular social contexts fro'm which its existence is inferred. Moreover, fetishes are frequently</page><page sequence="11">ROY ELLEN 223 metonymic, in that one part of something substitutes for the whole. It is significant that it is often 'parts' of saints or holy things that are fetishes, and not totalities: dismembered anatomy and matter indirectly associated with divers sacra, such as pieces of shrouds and tombs, oil from lamps which burned before them, dust from the ground around them (Sumption I975: 24). Bodies were dismembered in order to establish subsidiary shrines, as 'in the divided body the grace survives undivided' (1975: 28, quoting Theodoret of Cyrus). Limbs 'were put in separate reliquaries, thus permitting more pilgrims and therefore greater pecuniary contributions' (Finucane I977: 29). In my own Cathedral city- Canterbury-though the bones of Thomas Becket were taken upstairs to a new shrine in I220, pilgrims continued to venerate the empty tomb in the crypt (Finucane I977: 30). Similar processes seem to be at work in the realm of political economy, where the existence of commodities serves to disconnect entities from the social relationships in which they are embedded; and in much the same way sexual fetishes are ultimately a constituent of, and in a sense proxies for, a greater whole-the animated interacting human body. Attribution of the properties of living organisms There is a general tendency in human relations with the inanimate world to attribute and represent that world in organic terms, and to attribute inanimate objects with the properties of living things. There is nothing particularly mysterious about this, and it is perhaps the most prominent feature of those things we call fetishes, although by no means only characteristic of them. It happens because we are bound to model our world directly on those experiences which are most immediate, and these are experiences of our own body. Even our conceptions of personhood, and hence personification, are approached through the language of biological individuals and its associated organic metaphors. And we employ that selfsame model as a source of labels and concepts to interpret the world outside the body. The lexicon of animal parts is, after all, for the most part that of human anatomy. Botanical nomenclature is less so, and that of inanimate objects less still, but body terms-or at least terms which appear concurrently in anatomical lexicons-are still crucial (Ellen 1977b). More than this, if we 'thingify' parts of a living system, and then observe that the things move, so to speak, it logically follows that the things may well be regarded as, or spoken of, as if they were real things; they will appear as though they were indeed animate things. Thus things which have life (trees, human bodies) are turned into objects (carvings, saint's relics), only to be re-animated -but then usually as autonomous or semi-autonomous parts of some original whole. The attribution of the properties of living organisms, in the first place, serves as no more than a special case of concretisation. But what it does beyond this, and what concretisation in itself does not do (and it may indeed tend to imply the opposite), is to attribute physiological and behavioural characteristics-truly to 'animate' what has first been concretised. Capital, for instance, is often com- pared to a tree that may bear fruit, or an animal which reproduces after its own kind (Taussig I980: 13 I); the thing itself is the source of its own increase:</page><page sequence="12">224 ROY ELLEN 'Money will breed money'. And these are perhaps among the less exotic expressions of the standard formula for capitalist accumulation. Mauss (1954) is well-known for having reported that the Maoris believed that goods transacted were thought to be persons or pertain to a person, and that in exchanging something one was in effect exchanging part of oneself. For Taussig (I980: 36), if the atomistic view prevails, as it does in modern Western culture, then the isolated thing in itself must inevitably tend to appear as animated because in reality it is part of an active process. Animation of the cosmos is, therefore, omnipresent and pervious. However, the actual organic models used vary along a continuum from general organic analogies (organomorphs), plant analogies (phytomorphs), animal analogies (zoomorphs), general human analogies (anthropomorphs), and the attribution of the qualities of particular personalities (personification). Of these, what Marx called 'the personification of things' (Marx 1970 (I887): 809-Io), is the most developed, the most characteristic projection of what we call fetishes. It is so characteristic that it is worth looking in detail at one particular instance-in this case the manufacture of sacred shields by the Nuaulu of the eastern Indonesian island of Seram. Many Nuaulu clans possess sacred shields, anyawe mone, imbued with special powers and subject to veneration. Throughout its manufacture, a new shield is compared in detail with the old one-it must be an exact copy, and is treated and referred to as if it were a person. The shield it replaces is spoken of as 'being close to death, . . . no longer with breath . . . or strength . . . too old'. Personifi- cation is evident (among other things) from a number of practices: i. A sacred shield, during its manufacture or at any point thereafter, is never laid directly on the ground, or even on the floor of a ritual house. It is always first placed on a special pandanus mat. Humans too must never sleep directly on the ground, only on raised platforms or in traditional-style elevated houses; 2. As the new shield progresses over the months its genesis is likened to pregnancy (tiai: pregnant, full); 3. The shield has a proper orientation, the top being referred to as the 'head' and the bottom the 'foot'. It may never be held or placed 'head-down'. And when laying on its 'back' must adopt the setting sun, foot: rising sun, head orientation prescribed for sleeping. The raised strip running along the back is known as the spine (totu unie); 4. The head of any shield (sacred or otherwise) is indicated by attaching a charm. These vary from clan to clan, but invariably include ginger and red cloth. In some cases the feathers of totemic birds may be added. The fragments of Nautilus shell or porcelain attached to the front of the shield in fixed patterns are compared to the headdress worn by ritual specialists during ceremonies. The headdress too contains Nautilus shell, as well as various kinds of feathers and red cloth. All such additive materials are regarded as being functionally equivalent to human bodily adornment. 5. Coconut oil is rubbed over the tips, edges and finally the whole of a new sacred shield before it is considered complete, a process which may be</page><page sequence="13">ROY ELLEN 225 repeated on occasions when the shield is brought out from its place of rest. In the same way humans are smeared in oil or pig grease in preparation for dances and ceremonies. The oil is said to heal the wounds caused by humans during the gouging and cutting involved in its fashioning; 6. The spirit of the old shield is transferred to the new through a final rite of passage conducted on completion. In many respects this rite reflects the structure of those used for male initiation and installation into high office; 7. The first chip to be cut is wrapped in a red cloth and stored in the ritual house of the clan chief. This is functionally equivalent to the placenta and umbilicus in a human birth, which too must be preserved. It contains part of the soul of the wood, as the placenta contains part of the soul of a new-born child. And as with a new-born child in a menstruation house, it may not be removed from the house until complete; 8. All the chippings created in the carving of a sacred shield are collected in a basket and then taken to a spot in the forest where they are buried. Again, there is here a similarity with human personal leavings subject to ritualisation, such as the hair removed at a first hair-cutting ceremony. None of this is particularly distinctive to shield veneration, though with shields it reaches its peak. We can see many of the same attitudes and practices with respect to Nuaulu ritual houses (Ellen I986a). Neither are such practices confined to the Nuaulu. Objects from widely separated cultures are frequently represented as if they were human, are involved in processes which are recognisably human, are treated in ways that humans are treated-and in particular are in themselves subject to rites of passage, other rituals and attitudes, which are usually reserved for humans. Of the many descriptions of this kind of practice in the literature, consider, for example, a report of Tylor (I924: i67n, following Nilsson i868), that: in certain mountain districts of Norway, up to the end of the eighteenth century, the peasants used to preserve round stones, washed them every Thursday evening (. .), smeared them with butter before the fire, laid them in the seat of honour on fresh straw, and at certain times of the year steeped them in ale, that they might bring luck and comfort to the house. The additive materials so characteristic of Nuaulu shields are functionally little different from those attached to the divinatory objects described by Brain for various peoples of west Africa. Fetishes are given gifts, are named, massaged and talked to, sympathetically and with supplication; follow life-cycles in which they are strongest in their youth and weakest in old age; and after use are frequently laid aside to recuperate their powers. They may or may not be explicitly regarded as persons, but social interactions with them are as behaviour between persons, not that of persons towards objects. Fetishes may sometimes be said to see, hear, understand and act (Tylor 1924: i68). They may have the human passions of anger, revenge, generosity, gratitude (Haddon I92I: 83). Nuer make offerings of tobacco and food to their fetishes, and ritually ablute them; but they are also feared and disliked (Evans-Pritchard 1956: 102-3, I 58). Elsewhere they may be the subject of contempt and anger (Lubbock I870: I65). But despite such active personification there is no requirement that fetishes</page><page sequence="14">226 ROY ELLEN actually take on the physical form of humans, that is, become anthropomorphic figurines. By using metaphors of embodiment something that is merely objectified becomes something approaching a fetish. Though to say that non-human objects of all kinds are treated anthropomorphically is not, in itself, to say a lot, since humankind has no option but to apprehend and represent its world in anthropomorphic terms. Conflation of signifier and signified The relationship between signifier and signified may, as we have learned from Saussure, be either arbitrary or non-arbitrary. Thus the relationship between the word 'dog', the concept of dogginess and the real-world species Canisfamiliaris is quite arbitrary. In much human religious language, however, signifiers do not stand in a non-arbitrary relationship to the signified. The word 'God', for example, is not arbitrary since it is more than a grapheme or lexeme representing the concept 'God', and may itself be treated with respect and reverence. In many cases of this kind of non-arbitrary usage it is clear from the context of use, or from direct statements about uses, that it is understood that the word is only a signifier, that it stands for something else. Sometimes the signified is treated as though it were embodied in the signifier. Many of those things which have been conventionally labelled as fetishes are, to a degree, representations which have become signifieds and causative agents in their own right, not merely because they convey or stand for some other meaning. This accords with Tylor's conception of fetish. A similar notion is entailed when a signifier is somehow mystically transformed into the signified, as in the case of the host in a Catholic mass. In orthodox Catholic theology, the host does not simply represent the body of Christ, but-miraculously-becomes the body of Christ. The next step in any cognitive (though not necessarily evolutionary) sequence would be for the boundary between signifier and signified to breakdown altogether. In some cases the boundary between the two may merely become indistinct, though under certain circumstances this may ultimately result in dislocation or disjunction. In this situation, the signifier may become more important than what it stands for, and may be venerated for itself. Thus, for Pouillon (1975: I I9), fetish is signification rather than what is signified. In the Christian Catholic tradition a prime example of the simultaneity of signified and signifier is found in the veneration of the relics of saints, to which the original PortuguesefeitiCo was applied. In other cases the mystical content is different. Nuer fetishes have their own tie (soul); it does not stand for anything else. Other mystical objects are inhabited by ancestral ghosts. Nuaulu shields are allocated a soul (nemati) which in itself passes from one generation of shields to the next through a line of transmission activated in the ritualised replacement of one sacred shield by another. Thus, it is also like an ancestral clan spirit (though not one which has ever been a mortal human being). With money, too, the distinction between signified and signifier is blurred: modern coinage and banknotes are no more than promises which indicate suspended transactional relationships. And yet they are treated for most purposes as ifthey stood only for</page><page sequence="15">ROY ELLEN 227 themselves. This semantic shift has not quite been achieved with cheques or plastic 'credit' cards, though we must surely anticipate it. What is clear from such varied examples is that you cannot define the products of fetishisation in terms of their semantic or mystical content; what is diagnostic is the ambiguity between content and form, between signifier and signified. Where 'fetishisation' has occurred, therefore, the material object itself may be regarded as an active causative agent as much as anything it might stand for. The cvidence of ritual practice proclaims that in many instances it is an image which performs miracles, which is prayed to and to which promises are made (Christian I98I: 93). The ethnography of local religion in Spain is replete with such examples. The Black Madonna, Our Lady of Monserrat, located in a monastery northwest of Barcelona, has been an important centre of Spanish and Catalan pilgrimage for centuries. The image is nowadays protected by a glass screen, though a hole has been cut to allow physical contact (usually kissing) with the orb which she holds in her left hand. For many supplicants this physical contact is vital, as is the physicality of the spiritual presence. To all intents and purposes it is the image which is being worshipped, as the spiritual essence is intrinsic to this particular object and cannot be said to stand for some disembodied notion which has some temporary incidental association with it. Theological casuists and diverse varieties of believer will no doubt take issue with such an interpretation, but devotion to objects has long been part of the Christian tradition. Historically, it first took the form of the cult of relics-as early as the second century; the worship of images (of saints and the Madonna) followed rather later (Christian I98I: I26; Sumption I975: 22), though from the earliest period there has been a division of opinion as to its orthodoxy. For divines such as Vigilantius, the cult of relics was a pagan practice. The classic Christian defence is well-known: 'we do not worship their relics', protested St Jerome, any 'more than we do the sun or the moon. . .'. Objects were not worshipped in themselves, but merely as aids to the veneration of martyrs of undoubted holiness (Sumption 1975: 22-3), the earthly reminders of holy men. At other times the justification was more subtle, less equivocal; to put it impolitely, more fudged. Thus for Thomas Aquinas relics might enjoy a certain intrinsic merit on account of their holy connexions, and by working miracles at their tombs God demonstrated that he wished them to be venerated (Sumption 1975: 23-4). In the Eastern Church, also, the apologetic mobilised against the iconoclasts was that it was not the form which was being worshipped, 'but rather the prototype behind the image manifest through the representation' (Weitzmen I978: 8). Similarly, with Marian shrines the image is said to represent the Madonna, though the specific characteristics of local madonnas sometimes makes this difficult to believe. Such special pleading within the institutional Christian sects is echoed in other religious traditions, and where the explicated practices are not those of the apologists themselves reflects an aspect of Hume's distinction between 'elite' and 'vulgar' religion (Brown I98I). Tylor (1924: I69) had long ago recognised that for any two votaries an image may mean different things: either a symbol or an intelligent and active being. It is precisely this ambiguity, whether reflected in the contrasting attitudes of different</page><page sequence="16">228 ROY ELLEN supplicants, or in the mind of a single person which is generated by the cognitive processes which combine in 'fetishisation'. Ambiguous conceptualisation ofpower Finally, we come to power relations between people and objects. By turning ideas or relations into objects you can more easily manipulate and control them, or at least you may believe that you can. By animating what has been concretised the object acquires a utility over and above its appearance. In this way objects may become-though not inevitably-those 'machines' for divinatory pur- poses which Brain describes for the Bangwa. The Nuaulu sacred shield enables people to manipulate the abstract idea of clan-ness. For Lubbock, a fetish brought a deity within the control of mortals, and he reports a west African as saying 'we make and break our gods daily, and consequently are masters and inventors of what we sacrifice to' (Lubbock I870: I65, I96). In some extreme cases objects described in the literature as fetishes may be reviled, beaten and even discarded if they do not serve a user well (Lubbock I870: I96; Tylor I924 (I87I): I58), attitudes which are consistent with, and follow directly from, the conceptualisation of material objects as animate entities. The commoditisation of ideas, likewise, enhances the degree to which we believe we may control social relationships; and for the sexual fetishist the transference of erotic attachment to objects enables a degree of control impossible in terms of conventional relations with sentient and feeling humans. The ability to manipulate an abstraction because it has in some way been concretised is additionally important if that object itself has the ability to alter the material conditions of life. Those things we call fetishes have this dual quality. As long as figurines or relics are seen merely as passive objects through which the disembodied spirit can work then they do not appear to measure up to one of the more specific definitions of fetishes, that is objects described as having attained power, or which are power in themselves. Nuaulu shields protect, not merely physically, but magically also. The Kongolese nkisi is regarded as having certain magical effects when properly manipulated. The tenth century image of St Foy at Conques, 'was carried with clashing cymbals through the valleys of the Rouergue whenever the abbey's land was threatened' (Sumption I975: 52). Likewise, some eastern theologians were inclined to accord intrinsic powers to the relics of saints used in consecrating churches (Sumption I975: 29). The relic had power, which was activated through ritual manipulation. Contempt for the relics of the saints was regularly visited with dumbness, bodily distortion, disease, madness and death (Sumption I975: 4I), even though supplicants could themselves physically manipulate the objects and seek assistance through them. Failure to care for Nuaulu sacred shields may unleash malign ancestral forces and result in unpredictable events. Money does things, apparently on its own (it can be left to accumulate), and yet is obviously also manipulated. The boot fetishist can manipulate the object of his desire, but at the same time he is the victim of his mental condition-and may often indulge his fetish despite his rational feelings. Often he may find it difficult morally to accept his condition given the dominant conformist values of his society.</page><page sequence="17">ROY ELLEN 229 Thus, 'fetishisation' is characterised by a progressive ambiguity in the conceptualisation of power with regard to objects, and to understand it we must always presuppose a particular ideology of power. The desire to control increases with the intrinsic powers attributed to objects, but as these powers increase so they may counter the power which people have over them. This paradoxical tension is very characteristic of fetishes. The power relations between humans and supernatural beings or objects is always conditional, never absolute. Such an ambiguity derives from the human attribution of power to objects and a desire to control those intrinsic powers. Power is a volatile force, and the more power attributed to objects the more they are likely to be able to control the manipulator. One of the problems in analysing fetishised objects is that the objective properties of fetishes do not always correspond to their material or cultural effects. Bangwa believe that by manipulating an nkisi figurine they can control future events; most anthropologists would claim that they cannot, but seek to explain why-rationally-they think they can. For the Marxist, the active character of money is a figment of a particular cultural imagination: money can never, in itself, do what is attributed to it by those involved in a particular economic discourse. Likewise, the boot fetishist is convinced that in venerating boots he can obtain ecstatic sexual pleasure. Though a psycho-analyst may not deny that he does so, the behaviour nevertheless involves a displacement of 'real' sexual gratification. But in all cases what is present is a belief that the manipula- tion can attain particular ends, and that the representation of ordinary experience is sufficient for belief in that ends-means relationship to be maintained. Conclusion I began by suggesting that the subject of fetishism provided an appropriate opportunity to explore the articulation of cognition and collective representa- tions. We are now in a position to see more clearly why this should be so. To summarise, my argument is this: First, the overlapping concepts of fetish used in three historically-situated scholarly practices-anthropology, Marxism and psychology-all depend upon the concurrence of four underlying cognitive processes: concretisation, animation, conflation of signifier with signified, and an ambiguous tension between person and object in terms of control. These are all cognitive processes (means, agents, instruments) which help us first comprehend the world and then negotiate our way through it. They do so by acting on and through existing sets of beliefs or representations (the medium) and influencing the generation of new ones; indeed they are the co-ordinates which determine how much of what comprises belief is expressed and represented. Second, the processes outlined are apparent in the social construction of categories across the complete range of human experience, 'mundane' no less than 'symbolic'. Thus, if we wish to understand the processes which underly classifying activity in general, and which connect the instruments of cognition with the medium of belief and cultural representations, we would do well to</page><page sequence="18">230 ROY ELLEN begin with those processes through which are categorised the discontinuities of (as far as this is ever possible) un-socialised nature. Despite feedbacks from pre-existing classifications and representations, and their inextricable social contextualisation, animals and plants provide us with some of the simplest possible-in a word 'elementary'-relationships between objects and their representations accessible to ethnographers producing data in natural settings. Categories of natural kinds are about as rooted in the empirical world as categories can ever get, and in a way that those applied to the world of people and social phenomena can never be (Ellen I979: in preparation). So, while ethnobiology is in no sense unaffected by cultural relativities, it is sufficiently less so to serve as a bench-mark when examining classification more widely. This latter conclusion implies a distinction grounded in the kinds of 'entities' subjected to classifying activity, though it is sometimes presented as one between specialised theoretical approaches. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney-for example-has suggested that whereas cognitive anthropology focuses upon the phases in which memory codes are established, symbolic anthropology deals with the phases in which analogy codes are formulated (Ohnuki-Tierney I98I). I cannot agree that such professional distinctions relate to completely separate processes, historically or processually. The model which emerges here, and the evidence which supports it, indicates the mutual embeddedness of instrument and medium, individual perception and collective representation, in terms of linguistic expression, metaphorical penetration and classificatory structures involved. Though cognition and belief are often erroneously conflated, they are intrinsically bound together in particular instances. Third, the four cognitive processes isolated can be instructively modelled as part of a single logical sequence, by which percepts are progressively trans- formed into more complex categories. Beginning at the simplest level, we reify what we 'perceive' in terms of our sensory experience of natural and cultural discontinuities; what we reify may in turn be reconstituted as an icon (an abstraction represented as a material thing), and what we iconify animated through conflation of signifier with signified. This is schematically represented in figure i. Animation, through an analogy (ultimately with the sentient human body), provides a means for representing, comprehending and evoking; the inevitable consequence of which is the socialisation of the natural, material, world. But the socialisation of nature releases ambiguities, most notably in terms of the semiotic status of the objects or categories (their simultaneity as both signified and signifier) and in the perceived power relations between object and person. It seems to me that the best we can do is to see in 'fetishisation' an extension and culmination of this process, differing from iconification in shifting the balance from simultaneity towards 'the thing in itself'. In re-establishing 'things in themselves' as legitimate features of the cognitive landscape (see also Appadurai I986) we also bring back morphological reality-physically or ideationally construed-as an essential ingredient to understanding, in addition to func- tionality, iconicity or whatever is 'represented' (Ucko I969: 28-30). During the last fifty years anthropology has come to place less emphasis on the materiality of cultural phenomena and has become more interested-almost obsessively</page><page sequence="19">ROY ELLEN 23I SENSORY EXPERIENCE OF NATURAL AND CULTURAL DISCONTINUITIES PERCEPTS natural or social kinds neurophysiological constraints parts of things attributes REIFICATION an abstraction conceptualised REIFACT as a thing ICONIFICATION culturally-constructed encoding process an abstraction represented as ICON a material thing ANIMATION , I conflation of ORGANOMORPH signifier with signified PHYTOMORPH ZOOMORPH ANTHROPOMORPH 'FETISHISATION' cognitive I FETISHES I ambiguities arising from animation I FIGURE I. Cognitive processes underlying 'fetishisation'.</page><page sequence="20">232 ROY ELLEN so-in intricate abstracted systems of belief and webs of significance. Material culture can no longer be treated as though it were, somehow, outside culture. Finally, those things to which the word 'fetish' is customarily applied arise from attempts to construct a definite type of belief from a particular combination of cognitive features. The problem is that the same features, in various combina- tions, are characteristic of an extensive range of particular historically-fashioned representations, and it is this array of possibilities which constitutes the 'greater whole' of which that phenomenon labelled 'fetishism' must be considered an empirically ill-defined part. The boundary between fetishes and non-fetishes is consequently vague, admitting such a ludicrously wide area of reference. Fetishes cannot be treated as a special type of object, defined in terms of physical appearance or in terms of generic functional attributes; neither is fetishism a particular kind of mental condition (but rather an aspect of all thought). I have no particular desire to salvage terms once thought obsolete or retain old concepts as they stand, and I think I would actually resist applying the word 'fetish' to ritual objects I might encounter in the course of ethnographic analysis, even if they appeared to satisfy the various conditions listed. I am much more interested in dissecting the cognitive structure of the category implied in its usage, which seems to me to raise issues far too important to be consigned to some cul-de-sac in the history of ideas. NOTES I should like to thank the Librarians of St Augustine's Abbey, Ramsgate, and the Franciscan Study Centre in Canterbury for background assistance in preparing the original lecture, the Royal Anthropological Institute for inviting me to give it and the Department of Anthropology at the University of Manchester for being such perfect hosts. For their comments on a revised written version, or for help in clarifying various points, I am indebted tojosep Llobera, David McLellan and Janet Sayers. 'It is difficult to make a rigid distinction between fetishes and charms (under which I would include amulets and talismans), though some have attempted to do so. Ruth Benedict (Benedict, I938: 643-6), for example, suggests that we should use the word 'charm' when material objects are not anthropomorphised, where their mystical power is an attribute of the thing (like colour), and when they work automatically; when material objects are to varying degrees anthropomorphised, where their mystical power is intrinsic to the entity, and when they have to be ritually activated, then we are dealing with fetishes. A Nuaulu mauna is-in this sense a charm. It is made from a type of croton, leaves of a small tree which the Nuaulu call asinokoi and red cloth, the whole tied together with pineapple fibre (see the Museum of Mankind specimen As I.240). The mauna is made by the head of a patriclan section and given to a new-born child from the opposite section following the birth ritual. It guards a child for a period of 3-4 months against those evil spirits which are most likely to threaten the life and health of a baby during this crucial phase of its development. However, it is not very instructive (and possibly even misleading) to place the mauna in a quite separate category to the sacred shields which I discuss below, and to which the term 'fetish' might be more recognisably attached. Such a contrast may have a limited application as an ad hoc working distinction but it will not sustain close scrutiny. 2 'The leading article in No. I79 of the Kdlnische Zeitung (I842)', in Marx, I975, p. I89. He writes, 'the author . . . calls fetishism the "crudest" form of religion', and appears to adopt the evolutionist notion-to be later defended by Lubbock-that animal worship is a 'higher form of religion' than fetishism, which is characterised by the attempt of worshippers to seek the compliance of an object in attaining particular ends and the destruction of such objects which fail to do so. Marx had read Uber detn Dietust der Fetisc1hotter (I 785), the posthumous German translation of Du culte des dieuxfitiches by De Brosses (Marx 1970: II5; Rubel &amp; Manale I975: 23).</page><page sequence="21">ROY ELLEN 23 3 This latter fixation is sometimes distinguished in the literature as 'partialism' (Gebherd I97I). 4 Consider also the dual fetishistic character of those animated phalli, allegedly used as charms in the Graeco-Roman world. These mainly consist of birds with heads in the form of a phallus, or a phallus with human legs (see e.g. Boardman &amp; Rocca I978: I57), and originated in the Hellenistic Greek cities of the eastern Mediterranean basin (e.g. Miletus, Smyrna and Alexandria). 5 Haddon (I92I: 72-9i), as some of you may recall, offered a 'rag-bag' of no less than eleven essential characteristics' of fetishism, an assorted checklist which must have done much to hasten its demise as a useful descriptive term. These were: (i) 'may be any object whatsoever', (2) 'consists of a symbolic charm with sympathetic properties', (3) 'may consist of sign or token representing an ideal notion or being', (4) 'credited with mysterious powers owing to its being the habitation, temporary or permanent, of a spiritual being', (5) 'sometimes merely the vehicle or means by which the spirit communicates with his worshippers', (6) 'instrument by which the spirit acts', (7) 'possesses personality and will', (8) 'may act by will or force of its own proper spirit, entering or acting on it from without', (g) 'the spirit and the material object can be dissociated', (io) 'worshipped, prayed to, sacrificed and talked with', and (i i) 'petted or ill-treated with regard to its past or future behaviour'. This list is so varied and complex that it is of little comparative and analytic use. 6 For a more extended discussion of the concept of 'natural kinds' and 'basic' categories see Ellen (in preparation; I979; i986b).

Fetichisme Resume L'idee du fetichisme, en anthropologie, dans le marxisme, et en psychologle, est examin6e comme un cas particulier des reactions entre les theories de la cognition et des representations collectives. Les resultats classificatoires auxquels le mot 'f6tiche' a ete applique ne peuvent pas etre simplement compris comme des objets de genres sp6ciaux ou bien definis en fonction de leurs attributs fonctionnels generiques. Ils ne refletent pas une condition mentale particuliere non plus. Ils revelent plutot une combinaison variable de trois traits qui sont a la base des categorisations et des representations caract6ristiques de toute pensee. Ceux-ci sont la concr6t1sation, l'animation ou l'anthropomorphisme, la fusion du signifiant et du signifie, et une relation ambigue d'autorite entre la personne et l'objet. Tous reposent sur un continuum de processus qui commence avec l'identification de categories, des rapports et des phenomenes, et procede - par la reification et l'iconification - a leur personnification. Dans cette sequence ce que nous pouvons vaguement decrire comme 'f6tichisation' apparait comme un mouvement de la simultaneite equilibree du signifiant et du signifi6 vers 'la chose en elle-meme'.</page></plain_text>
