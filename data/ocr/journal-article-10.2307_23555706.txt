The paper focuses on two tra jectories in cognitive science: the modular approach of Pascal Boyer and the metaphorical approach of Lakoff and Johnson. Beginning with a brief discussion of Foucault s Birth of a Clinic, I identify three methodological moves central to empiricism. I then show how these three moves structure the modular and the metaphorical approach, both of which conjoin a particular way of seeing with a particular way of saying. In each case, religion is used to close, rather than open, the biological body. I contend that both approaches are part of a larger cultural incitement to (at least discourse about) religiosity. I conclude by reflecting on disciplinary differences as matters of intellectual taste.

Introduction Our continuing studies of subjectivity and the body in the humanities and the social sciences inevitably, if we go deeply enough, bring us back to the more com plex and unsolved questions of the natural sciences, questions we had perhaps hoped to foreclose, sidestep, or ignore, but that now press upon our most intimate and subjective experiences with more and more urgency.... We need to under stand not only how culture inscribes bodies—a preoccupation of much social and cultural theory in the last decade or more—but more urgently, what these bodies are such that inscription is possible, what it is in the nature of bodies, in biological evolution, that opens them up to... political, cultural, and conceptual evolution. —Grosz 2004: 2 and 3 I begin with these words by Elizabeth Grosz to indicate what I think is at stake in the recent resurgence of the life sciences—especially in the turn to biological © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012 DOl: 10.1163/157006812X632847</page><page sequence="2">A.

Grosz was responding to the situation in the mid-nineties, when critical theory was so dismissive of biological accounts that Eve Sedgwick and Adam Frank went so far as to charge that "theory has become almost coextensive with the claim (you can't say it often enough) it's not natural" (Sedgwick 2003: 109). While I still say (with Nietzsche) that there are no brute facts and all is interpretation—when a primary form of expression is genetic, the nature, function, and mechanisms of both discourse and biology have expanded (some say to the point of explosion). Not only can a neuroscientist like Antonio Damasio acknowledge "growing evidence that, over multiple generations, cultural developments lead to changes in the genome," but he can approach "[j]ustice systems, economic and political orga nizations, the arts, medicine, and technology" as "active curators of biological value" (2010: 37). "I know it is difficult," Damasio writes, "to imagine that the notions of 'desire' and 'will' are applicable to a single lonely cell. How can attitudes and intentions that we associate with the conscious human mind, and that we intuit to result from the workings of big human brains, be present at such an elementary level? But there they are, by whatever name you wish to call those features of the cell's behaviors" (2010: 35). Shades of Nietzsche indeed! We are two cultures no more (Snow 1960). Yet declarations do not make it so. Much contemporary discussion around the cognitive science of religion has difficulty moving beyond disciplinary supercessionism (at worst) and parallel play (at best). My intention in this paper is to make a modest step toward the kind of open dialogue for which Grosz calls by exploring what cognitive/ neuro-scientific accounts of religion look like when viewed through the lens of a Foucault-style history of science. I will start by extracting three methodological moves from Foucault's The Birth of the Clinic. I see these moves as central to the formation of any empiricism: • Empiricism is an effect produced by specific ways of synchronizing seeing ' and saying • Material relations precede relata (the terms they relate): objects and sub jects emerge out of singular historical practices; there is no natural object or eternal human problem that elicits various responses throughout the ages (Veyne 1998: 171-72) • Neither a simple break with nor a simple continuation of religion, West ern forms of secularism distance themselves from religion even as they intensify religious sensibilities, particularly surrounding sexuality. The body of this paper will use these three principles to analyze two major trajectories in the cognitive science of religion. I will conclude by re-framing</page><page sequence="3">120 A. Burlein I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 the felt dichotomy between 'discursive' and 'biological' forms of empiricism as a matter of intellectual taste. II. Foucault: An Eye that Speaks The Birth of the Clinic1 is often read as a scathing critique of the medical gaze. It is that. But it is also more. Between the first edition in 1963 and the second edition in 1972, Foucault developed his own practice of empiricism: to unearth the historical a priori of a given mode of knowledge. Foucault claimed clinical medicine was the West's first "scientifically structured discourse about the individual" (BC: 169-172), as well as the moment when Western experi ences of disease shifted from the metaphysics of evil to become a matter of lesions in tissues. Embedded in Foucault's analysis of empiricism, then, is an attempt (not to refute but) to escape Hegel, whose dialectic kicks off when sense-certain spirit cannot say the truth it means: its truth is the rich undoubt able presence of concrete particulars—that house, this love, here, now—but its every word speaks a universal. Foucault analyzed clinical medicine—and empiricism more generally (1 contend)-—as "the great myth of a pure Gaze which will be a pure Language: an eye which speaks" (NC: 115/114). This is my first methodological move: a fantasy undergirds empiricism: to know is to lift one's lids and speak-see. Eighteenth century clinicians in Paris thought they had stripped away abstract speculations and archaic superstitions to lay bare "the modest but effecting level of the perceived" that characterized medicine since Hippocrates (BC: xii). In contrast, Foucault attributed the alleged 'modesty' of the clinic (Shapin and Schaffer 1989)—defined by the systematic use of autopsy in hos pitals which thus became sites of teaching, research and treatment—to the associationist philosophy of Abbe Etienne de Condillac which enabled them to conjoin the perceptible and the statable in a new way (BC: xviii, NP: 115/114). Foucault saw this conjuncture as an event in thought: "The access of the medical gaze into the sick body was not the continuation of a move ment of approach that had been developing in a more or less regular fashion since the day when the first doctor cast his somewhat unskilled gaze from afar on the body of the first patient; it was the result of a recasting at the level of ' When I cite the English translation, the citation reads BC.

As a result, Laennec, for example, was the first to see the differ ent consistency of a liver affected by cirrhosis—not because no one had ever looked at a cirrhotic liver before, but because they had neither the eyes to see it when they did, nor a language sufficiently subtle to capture "a hitherto unperceived pathological individuality" (BC: 169). Thus not only did patho logical anatomists link the dual senses of the infinitive 'to anatomize' in a particularly tight way (principle #1), they also articulated a new system of ill ness (principle #2). In this system, a) disease was defined as 'pathological life' insofar as it was caused by the normal wear and tear of tissues; b) the inside of the human body became solid and mappable; and thus c) it was the doctor and not the priest who presided over death. In this new experience of suffering, religion was central albeit in a new way (principle #3). According to medicines own origin story, modern clinical medicine was born when a few heroic men dared to cut into—and thereby know—that which God had sealed. Yet by the eighteenth century, an "ana tomical church militant and suffering" no longer existed and so had to be invented (BC: 126; Park 2006: 3-4). "... [Djoctors had to feel, in the depths of their scientific appetite, the repressed need to open up corpses" (BC: 125 6). It was by professing to speak against 'religious repression that the doctor's will to know was recognized as one whose truth would set people free (NP: 127/125-6). The clinics origin circa the French Revolution was no accident. Social reformers dreamt of a generalized presence of doctors throughout the provinces who would care for bodies as priests had cared for souls (BC: 31-36). By casting itself as opposed to religious consolation (be serene in your suffer ing), medicine provided concrete vocabularies and empirical technologies for the emergence of the secular state as a "Great Eye ' which saw the misery of its citizens and acted to remove it (BC: 40; Asad 2003: 100). Yet medicines relation to religion was no simple break: the anatomical gaze relied on and strengthened religious and moral sensibilities regarding 2 According to James Bernauer, the technical distinction between connaissance (the content of particular disciplines) and savoir (the conditions of possibility in a given historical period of being able to speak truly or falsely) appears for the first time in Foucault in the second edition of Birth of the Clinic, as Foucault moved away from presenting his work as a "structural analysis" (2000). For more on the importance of this distinction to Foucault s own empirical practice of an archaeology of knowledge, cf. Gutting 1989: 251-53.</page><page sequence="5">122 A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 sexuality. "For thousands of years," Foucault narrated, "doctors had tasted patients' urine to test it. Much later, they began to touch, to tap, to listen. Was this a result of the fact that the old moral interdictions had finally been lifted by the progress of the Enlightenment?" (BC: 166-7). Foucault thought not. Doctors needed to place their ear on a woman's breast to hear her heart. But we can't! Yet we must! Not for subjective reasons of sexual desire but for objec tive reasons of science. According to Foucault, Paris clinicians turned the dis tance that shame prescribed into a screen onto which doctors could "fix the virtual image of that which is happening far below the visible area That which one cannot see is shown in the distance from that which one must not see" (NP: 168/164). As a result, "[kjnowledge develops in accordance with a whole interplay of envelopes... Its lively curiosity invents innumerable means, including the shameless use of shame: witness the stethoscope" (BC: 166) which Laennec invented AFTER he had re-discovered the technique of aus cultation (tapping on the chest) only to find himself 'hindered' by moral obstacles against placing his ear on women's breasts. In sum, pathological anatomy emerged when doctors yoked seeing and say ing together by means of Condillac's philosophy associating sensation and language (principle #1). The systematic use of autopsy for purposes of treat ment and research engendered a new distribution of illness, marked by the clinical body and the gaze of the doctor as the great white eye that has seen death (principle #2). Finally, while portraying themselves as the anatomical church militant and suffering, the men of the Paris clinic strengthened reli gious and moral sensibilities in order to authorize a deeper penetration of technology and knowledge into the human body (principle #3). Taking these three principles as constitutive of empiricism, I will use them to analyze two major trajectories in the cognitive science of religion. The first trajectory is variously dubbed the embodied or situated cognition approach. I will focus on the work of Lakoff and Johnson, who use neuroscience to advance a metaphorical account of cognition. Their work is being taken up quite widely by scholars across the social sciences and humanities. I will argue that the advantage of the metaphorical (or embodied cognition) approach is that it can focus analytical attention on the middle level of specific and overlapping religious phenomena: how religious and medical rituals might modulate pain, for instance. I will explore the metaphorical approach last. I will start by exploring a rival approach, which envisions cognition as a series of specialized computational modules or devices. So: no gene for God here, no brain center for spirituality. Instead, the contention is that religion in general—for such is the explanatory level to which this approach aspires— arises indirectly out of cognitive devices that were selected for survival value.</page><page sequence="6">A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 123 For example: humans have a hyperactive agency detection device (HADD) that evolved for protection from predators, but which now has people across the globe believing in supernatural figures (gods, spirits, ancestors). My text will be Pascal Boyer's 2001 text Religion Explained (hereafter RE), which I chose partly because Barbara Herrnstein Smith focused her analysis on Scott Atran, but largely because Boyer's Religion Explained is the book my students know—and not because they were assigned it! (In fact, my copy was given to me several years ago by a student who was going to Iraq as a way for me to remember him.) III. The Modular Approach: Pascal Boyer Using my first principle from Foucault, I will show how Boyer conjoins seeing and saying by means of "folk disciplines" to produce the empiricism-effect: to know is to lift one's lids and speak-see. Guided by my second principle (rela tions precede relata), I will argue that much as pathological anatomists thought they had returned to a "clinic" present since Hippocrates, so Boyer's account of religion relies on a still point: "a normal brain in a normal environment," in Boyer's words; "a stone age mind in a space age world," in Scott Atran's. This still point enables the modular approach to treat mind and world as relatively stable and established entities—not all cognitive science does this. Boyer uses the stability of religion's relatively timeless truths to contain difference (principle #3). Yet Boyer's discussion of the diverse variety of religious notions and behav iors is one of the best things about his book. Unlike strands of neuroscience which resuscitate perennial philosophy, Boyer "gets" that diversity runs deeper than your being Baptist and my being Buddhist (to use his examples). Boyer knows that supernatural agents can be stupid; they can be replaced if their job performance is poor; and they do not always concern themselves with salva tion. And he knows that 'religion is a category inflected by the peculiarities of Western history. For Boyer, humans are "the information animal." Our ecological niche is information (RE: 3 and 325). Because we depend on "rich information," we need cooperation (RE: 120) and "information about other people's mental states" (RE: 122). But we also need to order the chaotic plethora of informa tion in which we live, move and have our being. One way order happens is through ontological categories, each of which provide a frame plus a series of expectations. If you put something in a particular category (let's say ANI MAL), you expect certain things. If you identify it as a PERSON, you expect</page><page sequence="7">124 A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 other things (RE: 78). The value of these templates is the inferences they enable (RE: 95). Ontological categories assimilate sensory data by cutting through the mass of detail to foreground essential similarities. Those who pon der whether they are really justified in concluding that this particular oncom ing animal is a predator (like the last one) do not contemplate their navels for long. While this action-oriented approach to knowledge led Nietzsche to con clude that what we call truth might be nothing more than the errors our spe cies cannot do without, this strand of cognitive science (unlike the metaphorical approach) seems relatively uninterested in deconstructing the 'fit' between organism and environment on the one hand, and human knowl edge on the other. For Boyer, thinking remains resolutely internal, and thus religion most properly concerns beliefs, a focus that leads him to pay little significant attention to material objects and practices (Day 2004). Boyer is more interested in what ontological categories enable. Ele sees these categories as "switch settings [that] activat[e] or inactivat[e]" (RE: 113) our intuitive (or folk) physics system, our goal-detection system, our folk psychology system, and so forth (RE: 100). Take fear, induced by rustling bushes. Heartbeat quickens, perspiration increases: "[W]e have to choose among several behaviors in such instances— freeze or flee or fight—a choice that is made by computation, that is, by men tally going through a variety of aspects of the situation and evaluating the ieast dangerous option. So fear is not just what we experience about it; it is also a program, in some ways comparable to a computer program. It governs the resources of the brain in a special way" (RE: 21-22; emphasis added). Here Boyer seems to be envisioning cognition as serial computation, rather than connectionist. In the latter, the brain computes over associations, so that rather than choosing' between diverse programs, one finds oneself fleeing or fighting.3 For Boyer, having a normal brain does not mean you will get religion (RE: 4). Individual minds inherit not traits, but the capacities to build them. (This is the legacy of charges of genetic determinism directed at sociobiology (Sterelny and Griffiths 1999: 313-38)). If someone does develop religion, however, their religious expressions will fall within a closed set of possibilities. Religious concepts are formed when an ontological category is joined with a "tag" that violates associated expectations.4 "The many forms of religion we know," Boyer contends, "are not the outcome of a historical diversification, but Anthony Dardis, personal communication. William Connollys Neuropolitics is informed by cognitive science in the connectionist paradigm (2002). 4 Because of this structure (ontological category plus violating tag), the modular approach speaks of agents as supernatural'—admittedly a term with historical baggage, but which cogni tive science attempts to use as a mere placeholder. John Teehan, personal communication</page><page sequence="8">A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 125 of a constant reduction" (RE: 32; emphasis in original). For religions to be transmitted, they must "jointly activate inference systems for agency, préda tion, death, morality, social exchange, etc. Only a small range of concepts are such that they reach this aggregate relevance, which is why religion has com mon features the world over" (RE: 324-5). Kim Sterelny sees this combination of multiplicity and unity as the power of Boyer's account of religious cognition and behavior (2003: 192). Matthew Day sees this insistence on strict con straints to the formation of religious concepts as crucial to its scientific preten sions, lest it "be left to wrestle with the ad infinitum of variations and responses that natural selection tends to generate" (2007: 63). Principle #1: Folk Disciplines Enable Us to Speak-See From a Foucaultian point of view, just as the anatomist's gaze came pre equipped with a logical armature that came from Condillac, so the modular approach comes pre-equipped with a vision of mind that came from Fou cault s old debating partner, Noam Chomsky. While Chomsky acknowledged that experience "initializes" our "language organ," he thought we do not really learn language. Instead, much of the information crucial for language compe tency is pre-given and functionally autonomous. Chomsky's domain-specific language device was generalized by J.A. Fodor in his 1983 classic The Modular ity of Mind. Ten years later, the essays collected in the Adapted Mind (by Barkow, Tooby and Cosmides) generalized Fodor's insight that cognition evolved to address specific problems posed in special domains by ancestral environments. This specificity and specialty resulted in a proliferation of infer ence systems thought to arise spontaneously' as humans interact with their environment. Dubbed 'folk' disciplines, these inference systems include folk physics and folk biology, folk psychology and folk morality. I see these 'folk disciplines' as Boyer's version of Condillac. Folk disciplines enable Boyer to assume a fit between seeing and saying (principle #1). Thanks to this link, Boyer can move from demonstrating this behavior in these people at this time and this place to speak about humans, brains, religion in general.3 Thus one way to understand what "folk disciplines" do is help Boyer mediate the paradox of sense-certainty that catalyzed Hegelian idealism. 5 Shapin considers such metonymy to be fundamental to scientific truth: .. [T]hat to which scientists naturally have, or have worked to secure, effective access is intended to stand for that to which they cannot, or do not yet, have access. That métonymie relationship is a way of point ing to the scope of science: scientific claims—only provided they achieve credibility—act as a shorthand for the natural world" (2010: 23).</page><page sequence="9">126 A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 "It is not too surprising," Boyer writes, "that various people have similar representations about the ghosts' thought processes, although no one ever talks about it. The representations are similar because the PERSON template in everybody's mind is very similar. Cultural transmission is cheap; it does not require much effort at communication, as long as templates in our mind pro vide order for free" (RE: 75). Boyer, of course, has no direct access to the person template to see that it really is the same in every case. Boyer frames an argument akin to that of Freud: given a set of demonstrated phenomena, the best way to account for these phenomena is to postulate cognitive mecha nisms below consciousness. Alternatively, Daniel Dennett puts these folk notions in scare quotes: in his pragmatist view, it does not really matter if these conventional forms of intentionality and belief are what drives human behavior in fact insofar as folk notions serve as reliable predictors for human behavior (Day 2007: 50-53 and 60). In keeping with these assumptions, Boyer's book begins with a discussion of common scenarios for explaining religion. They are what students say on the first day of an introductory class: religion is for social cohesion, existential comfort, pre-scientific accounts of nature. Boyer deems these scenarios "not that bad" (RE: 6; emphasis in text). To his mind, these scenarios tackle crucial questions: Why are there many religions rather than one? Why do people believe? Why do people kill for religion? Why does religion persist? While Boyer claims to be merely "adding to the bookshelves" of "treatises on religion, histories of religion, religious people's accounts of their ideas"—in the very next clause, Boyer proclaims that while religion presents mysteries so baffling that we did not even know how to proceed (hence all those volumes), cogni tive science has transformed these intractable mysteries into "difficult but manageable problems" (RE: 2). In contrast, I actively discourage students from asking the kinds of questions that drive Boyer's scenarios. I see such questions as too general to be informative, illuminating or even very interest ing about how actual people live religion. To my mind, such questions share the same fallacy as asking why some people become gay: the question invents the problem. Similarly, while Boyer approaches his object through the problematic of science versus religion, troubling this dichotomy is one of the first moves made by introductory textbooks in the history of science. This dichotomy also does not accurately describe U.S. history, which has been replete with forms of religiosity that see themselves as allied with science; these religious formations continue to play a crucial role in alternative medicine today. Much less does this dichotomy fit with my claim that the birth of clinical medicine circa the French Revolution involved a complex double-voicing of religious sensibilities regarding the body.</page><page sequence="10">A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 127 Not only might there well be many pathways to phenomena as complex as religiosity (and homosexuality), but I see the search for this kind of a 'why' as an artifact of an analytical (and yes, socially inflected) category—namely, reli gion in general. This category makes sense in the scholar's study (J.Z. Smith 1982: xi). Given a society as confused about religion as our own, it also makes pedagogical and political sense to group together scholars of different religions in an academic department. But in keeping with Ann Taves' recent theoriza tion of religion as one of many things that humans deem special, I see nothing unique, original, or suigeneris about either religious or scientific cognition and behavior. Just because it makes cultural sense to speak about 'religion' does not mean (as Foucault famously argued regarding madness) that religion exists in general. This is, of course, the kind of counter-intuitive claim that made Foucault's intellectual work seem brilliant... or exasperating. To explain it, allow me to turn to principle #2, which asserts the primacy of relations. Principle #2: Folk Disciplines and the Search for a Still Point Foucault's point in denying the existence of an object like madness (or reli gion) was to foreground the primacy of material practices. As historian Paul Veyne puts it: "The denial of madness is not situated at the level of attitudes toward the object, but at that of its objectivization [Ajcross the ages we do not encounter the evolution or modification of a single object that always appears in the same place. We are dealing with a kaleidoscope, not a tree nurs ery. Foucault does not say, 'For my part, I prefer discontinuity, breaks,' but 'Beware of false continuities.' A false natural object such as religion or a certain religion aggregates very dissimilar elements (ritualism, sacred books, a sense of security, disparate emotions, and so on) that, in other eras, will be expressed in very different practices and objectivized through these practices in very differ ent guises" (1998: 168-172; Foucault 2009: 118). As Nietzsche put it in his discussion of genealogy: "The form is fluid, the meaning even more so" (1994:55). In contrast, Boyer uses the 'folk disciplines' to provide (what I call) a still point: a normal brain in a normal environment. At first glance, this is curious: the computational capacities of the brain seem strangely settled for a theory about change over time. The idea, of course, is that evolution is cumulative and incremental: sudden and/or large transformations are likely to result in the organism becoming nonviable. While rejecting biological determinism, Boyer limits development to triggering internal computational devices on or off. So while E.O. Wilson's cover blurb casts Religion Explained "in the spirit of the French Enlightenment," I situate Boyer within the long line of domesticating mis-recognition that has dogged Darwin, preventing us again</page><page sequence="11">128 A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 and again from facing "Darwin's dangerous idea" (Dennett 1996). Títere is not much body in Boyer's cognitive devices—and even less difference—although Boyer starts with diversity and does it better than most. Boyer acknowledges that someone could construct a religious notion or behavior that lies outside his/her ontological categories. Mutations happen. But for Boyer, deviant developments remain marginal—they do not correspond to expectation for mats and thus they cannot generate inferences. To say this with a bit more edge, these deviants cannot reproduce, being found only "in obscure theo logical scholarship rather than in popular representations" (RE: 163). Along with an indifference to material objects and practices, then, Boyer's under standing of religion relegates theological and ideological concerns to the level of mere superstructures with no significant recursive effect on the 'base.' More strongly, I contend that Boyer's appeal to disciplines of the folk functions as an invocation of "the normal" that works to render moot the question of what Boyer's object should be.6 Is human aggression, for example, a single trait? Chimps, after all, have two different threat displays. But what if aggression is just one small part of a larger "tit for tat" strategy which could include coop eration? Because human traits are often interdependent, determining the right object is a crucial but non-obvious question (Sterelny and Griffiths 1999: 315-6). Oneway, then, to understand the significance of Foucault's claim that forms of empiricism work by conjoining seeing and saying is to suggest, with Steve Shapin, "that many notions flowing from expert human and social sci entific culture enjoy a credibility advantage by virtue of being high-toned ver sions of locutions already present—in some form and to some degree—in lay culture" (2010: 28). Boyer sees his explanation of religion as "departing from our spontaneous intuitions" (RE: 321). For him, the folk disciplines provide a diving board from which the empirical researcher plunges into the cognitive unconscious. In contrast, I want my critical accounts of religion to effect a sharper break with cultural common sense. This is in part because I want to explain (not religion in general) but the way that religion in modernity exerts force without anyone needing to postulate supernatural agents. There you are, having a con versation whose topic has nothing to do with religion, religion is not even on the horizon of what you are talking about... and then the issue of sexuality comes up and all of a sudden you understand why all those French guys spent 6 Again, not all cognitive neuroscience does this. In addition to the Dennett's instrumentalist invocation of the folk disciplines, Antonio Damasio will use conventional ways of talking about emotion to guide his research into the neuroscience of emotions and feelings, but he deems these categories inadequate and marks his usage as provisional: "[a]s knowledge accrues, the labels and the classifications are likely to change" (2003: 43).</page><page sequence="12">A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 129 so much time trying to theorize the power of discourse as something that we do not speak: it speaks us. When it comes to sexuality and gender, religion (structured in dominance with Protestantism on top) still speaks us. This is in keeping with Foucaults contention that the fundamental problem of religion and politics in the West concerns not around church and state, but the mixed figure of "the minister, with all the ambiguities of that word": the minister of a church; the Minister of State and other governmental ad-ministrations; and voluntary ministry to the suffering (Foucault 2007: 191-92). Thus I read Foucaults claim that sexuality is modernity's quintessential sermon as more than mere metaphor or sarcasm. Or more exactly, it is precisely sarcasm in the Foucaultian sense of laughter as a critical scalpel—"knowledge" being made "not for understanding but for cutting" (Foucault 1977: 154). Interlude: Causality and Its Discontents According to Boyer, both Mayans and American college students conceptual ize the natural world at the level of species (even though the actual species they name vary). While this kind of claim exasperates a Foucaultian, Boyer finds this fact good to think with. Boyer sees it as evidence for the existence of a cognitive program that sets frames and parameters within which cultural scaffolding develops and can then, in its turn, reflect back onto the program. As I noted earlier, in this book Boyer limits the role of environment or culture to triggering internal devices on and off. Yet as newer brain studies dispute the specificity of brain locus implied by the notion of module, later works in the cognitive science of religion use looser images such as tools, predispositions, and devices.7 John Teehan sees such devices as "natural anchor points," on the model of a retractable leash (2010). In this frame, the power of different cul tural environments concerns their ability to extend or shorten that leash (Schloss, Barret and Murray 2010: 626). The alternative model provided by developmental systems theory (or what Barbara Herrnstein Smith calls the dynamic ecological approach) contends that information can evolve in development so that the leash itself is part of a series of interlocking developmental systems. Its classic text is Susan Oyama's The Ontogeny of Information (first published in 1985). Oyama broadens inher itance beyond the organism to "its developmental system": the changing com plex of interacting influences, some of which are inside the organism and some of which are outside but all of which count as essential contributors to the emergence of form and variation—not just in special cases like parasites John Teehan, personal communication.</page><page sequence="13">130 A.

For Oyama, then (as well as for LakofF and Johnson, as we shall see), neither Dawkins' later notion of an extended phenotype,8 nor Boyer's conclusion that cross-cultural regularity bears witness to an unseen cognitive device, would go far enough. Much as there is no one-to-one correspondence between molecular structures and the traits people actually exhibit, so there is not necessarily a one-to-one corre spondence between neural structures and the beliefs people actually live.9 While all agree that reliability and regularity arise from certain processes and interactants becoming so tightly coupled that they can be reliably reassembled in each generation, developmental systems theory departs from the replicator/ interactionist view of someone like Dawkins by arguing that while this regular coupling can happen on the level of molecular or neural structure, it need not in every case: one must empirically investigate (Oyama 2000: 43 and 48). In short, developmental systems theory denies the assumption at work in the notion of folk disciplines according to which minds can connect to the envi ronment—productively or normally—in only one way (Sterelny 2003: 233). Principle #3: The Christian Secular While debates about causality and control concern empirical and theoretical issues, they also involve contestations regarding the power of the scientific secular to govern. Boyer sees religion as a natural form of cognition and behav ior, different from no other, and yet one whose strangeness is nevertheless in need of scientific explanation. For Boyer it is science that is special: "What makes scientific knowledge-gathering special is not just its departure from our spontaneous intuitions but also the special kind of communication it requires, not just the way one mind works but also how other minds react to the infor mation communicated. Scientific progress is brought about by a very odd forms of social interaction, in which some of our motivational systems (a desire to reduce uncertainty, to impress other people, to gain status, as well as the aesthetic appeal of ingenuity) are recruited for purposes quite different than their evolutionary background. In other words, scientific activity is both cognitively and socially very unlikely, which is why it has only been developed 8 While replicator/interactionist thinkers like Dawkins tend to envision causality as primar ily—not exclusively—one-way, they have broadened their notion of causality by acknowledging that the target of genetic causality can extend beyond the specific organism in which "selfish genes" are located. Thus Dawkins speaks of an extended phenotype in the case of parasites. '' Matthew Day argues that this fact renders Boyer's explanation of religion sufficiently statis tically tentative so as to call into question the explanatory power of his model (2007).</page><page sequence="14">A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 131 by a very small number of people, in a small number of places, for what is only a miniscule part of our evolutionary history" (RE: 321-22). Boyer here revives the classic story of secularism. Indeed, a concern for religious violence seems the spur behind much of the turn to the modular approach.10 In contrast to those who contend that violence and injustice decrease when reason rules, I do not think that religion leads to more violence than... shall we say: the secular commitment to a lifestyle that has Americans, as 3% of the globes people, arrogating 25% of the globe's resources? I could polemicize with further examples about the 99%, but so, dear reader, could you. Unlike those who deem secularism necessarily less violent than religion, I agree with William Connolly when he argues for putting all forms of reason (scientific as well as philosophical) on the same plane with religion and spiri tuality (2005). For Connolly, this means taking seriously the diverse ways in which religion, science, and philosophy all involve thought and argumenta tion, reason and evidence; as well as habit and ritual, devotion, dispositions, and belief. Taking seriously does not mean conflating: the empiricism of vari ous scientific methods is NOT identical to the empiricism of Foucaultian histories of the present. While all three involve similar elements, they differ in their methods and styles of combination. What Connolly means by placing all three styles of thought on the same plane, then, is rather that there is no truth so uncontested that we all simply surrender to its truth-telling power. As Owen Flanagan argues: "even if everything there is, is the way it is because some set of causes made it that way, it does not follow that the only real relation, or the only interesting relation, is the causal one" (2009: 13). Indeed, one of my delights in the nineties was watching scholars in science studies run into a situation that scholars of religion know all too well. As Shapin puts it: "As we get, we like to think, better and better at doing the history of science, we know less and less about what makes it science and not some other differently desig nated form of culture" (Shapin 2010a: 8). Sound familiar? Placing religion, science, and philosophy on the same plane raises a series of Nietzschean questions about the search for truth. What would it take to develop evolutionary accounts of the human that are robust enough to resist the powerful pull of normativity that has dogged Darwin's reception from the get-go? Almost fifty years ago now, Foucault argued that the reason the life sciences became the model for the human sciences in the nineteenth century 10 The final chapter in John Teehans book In the Name of God is devoted to understanding what to do about the fact that the dynamics of in- and out- group are what makes religion so violent; how to ameliorate the violence that results from the simple fact that the cognitive devices we have stress in-group identification and out-group exclusion. Likewise, Scott Atran's more recent work also focuses on religious violence.</page><page sequence="15">132 A. Burlein /Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) ¡18-142 was NOT because of the comprehensive character of the concept of life. The "science of man appeared as an extension of the science of life" because its epistemic field was undergirded by "the medical bipolarity of the normal and the pathological" (BC: 34-35). Similarly, I contend that reading the modular (or internalist) approach through a Foucaultian lens situates cognitive neuro science and evolutionary psychology—contemporary contenders for becom ing the model for the human sciences—in an epistemic field that is structured in depth by the bipolarity of the normal and the pathological. Once again, there are other methodological choices available, as indicated by the literature concerning the distinction between statistical normality and social normativ ity. As my opening quote from Elizabeth Grosz indicates, there are large stakes here, things to be fought for (and against). If Antonio Damascio can verbally acknowledge Althussers ideological apparatuses as "active curators of biologi cal value" (2010: 37), what would we need to do—to unlearn and to invent— in order to develop theories of religion whose naturalism is not contingent on becoming tone-deaf to the politics of knowledge (that of science or our own)? In contrast to Boyers desire for a completely scientific or mechanistic account of religion that will lay to rest the problems around which the ethnography of religion has revolved, I ask what it would take for us to develop theories that use the relations of knowledge-power that imbue religion to open biological explanations beyond the dichotomy of the normal and the pathological? IV. The Metaphorical Approach: LakofF and Johnson For the embodied or situated cognition approach, I will examine the work of linguist George LakofF and philosopher Mark Johnson, especially their book Philosophy of the Flesh (hereafter PF). I will argue, first, that LakofF and John son conjoin seeing and saying in a literal link: the neural connections we form as children. Second, the still point around which the metaphorical approach turns, then, is not "the normal brain in a normal environment"—but the timeless child. Thus while LakofF and Johnsons understanding of truth as metaphorical deconstructs master narratives, I will argue that LakofF and Johnson contain this potential for pluralism within a philosophical anthropol ogy. Predictably enough, perhaps,—and this is my third principle—it is at precisely this point that religion enters: our neural capacity to project will be the source of the human capacity for an embodied transcendence whose mechanism resembles that of dreaming. Disagreeing with strong modular theories of mind and language, LakofF and Johnson understand evolution to mean, instead, that our abilities to reason</page><page sequence="16">A. Burlein I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 133 and reflect grew out of perception and physical movement: "Over the course of evolution, newer parts of the brain have been built on, taken input from, and used older parts of the brain. Is it really plausible that, if the sensorimotor system can be put to work in the service of reason, the brain would build a whole new system to duplicate what it could do already?" (PF: 43) As their talk of plausibility indicates, much as Boyer has no direct access to the mod ules that he thinks take effect in most people most of the time (Day 2007: 59), so LakofF and Johnson cannot yet empirically demonstrate that we actually reason with the same neural circuitry we use to perceive and to move (PF: 583). What they have done is develop a series of neural computational models which indicate that it is at least possible for abstract thought to boot-strap itself from sensation via metaphor. In ways that would be dear to the young Foucault who wrote an introduction to Ludwig Binswanger's The Dream and Existence, LakofF and Johnson suggest that the actual neural mechanism involved might resemble dreaming. In dreams ". ..we use the visual system of our brains to 'see' images based on input not coming from our retinas. Simi larly, perceptual mechanisms, freed by neural inhibition from their purely per ceptual functions, could be used to perform abstract reason" (PF: 575). When LakofF and Johnson speak of an "embodied mind," they mean more than the "trivial" fact that we cannot think without a body (PF: 37). For LakofF and Johnson, humans are neural animals. "... [T]he very structure of reason itself comes from the details of our embodiment" (PF: 4), including the peculiar fact that the brain passes information from one dense ensemble of neurons to another via a "relatively sparse set of connections The sparse set of connections necessarily groups together certain input patterns in mapping them across to the output ensemble" (PF: 18). This neural binding is catego rization. What justifies calling these neural structures concepts "is their infer ential capacity, their ability to be bound together in ways that yield inferences. An embodied concept is a neural structure that is actually part of, or makes use of, the sensorimotor system of our brains. Much of conceptual inference is, therefore, sensorimotor inference" (PF: 20; emphasis in original). Insofar as abstract thought evolved out of our sensorimotor capacities, LakofF and Jonson deem cognition mostly" a matter of metaphor. When we reason, we are creatively mis-using neural structures that were originally devel oped to enable sensation and movement. Abstract cognition is metaphorical in that it arises as the literal trans-position of inferences onto 'improper' objects " According to Lakoff and Johnson, primary metaphors combine with: 1) literal forms of thought (like spatial relations); 2) interpersonal relations; and 3) cultural common sense. All these sources are folded into the complex metaphors that constitute abstract thought.</page><page sequence="17">134 A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 (PF: 4). Not surprisingly, Lakoff and Johnson use thoughts metaphorical character to deconstruct correspondence theories of truth. In this, they are akin to Nietzsche, when he declared that there are no colors in nature, or sounds—not as we see and hear them (Kofman 1993: 28). All is metaphor. Everything is equally improper.12 Insofar as scholars of religion have felt sealed within what Frederic Jameson called the prison-house of language, this approach can enable a break-out.13 Representations—the ways in which we signify and construct reality—are not our only means of access to the real. Action provides another route (Grosz 2004: 191). As Shaun Gallagher puts it in How the Body Shapes the Mind: "It may even be possible to say that bodily movement, transformed onto the level of action, is the very thing that constitutes the self" (2005: 9). For Lakoff and Johnson, this 'shaping' (Nietzsche's formative force) takes body first and fore most in metaphors we live by. Principle #1: Primary Metaphors Conjoin Seeing and Saying According to Lakoff and Johnson, just as children cannot help but love and idealize their parents, so children cannot help "projecting" sensorimotor expe riences onto the domain of conceptual judgments and subjective evaluations. As infants we did not differentiate being physically held from being emotion ally connected; as adults we speak of "a warm smile" or "a close friend." Child hood conflation of sensation and conception results in several hundred primary metaphors: while originally contingent, these neural mappings eventually become permanent. I see these "primary metaphors" as Lakoff and Johnson's version of a Condillac-style element linking seeing and saying. Lakoff and Johnson contend: "We acquire a large system of primary meta phors automatically and unconsciously simply by functioning in the most ordinary of ways in the everyday world from our earliest years. We have no choice in this [W]e all naturally think using hundreds of primary metaphors" (PF: 47): happy is up; bad is stinky; difficulties are burdens; know ing is seeing; understanding is grasping (for more, PF: 50-54). These concep tual metaphors can manifest in language—but also in gesture, art, or ritual 12 As Kofman wrote in Nietzsche and Metaphor. .. Nietzsche speaks of an originary instinc tive activity, an artistic force creating fictions. This allows man to remake the world in his image so as to master it: an anthropomorphic transposition which, in order to be effective, must neces sarily be performed self-effacingly.... It is not just a drive like any other; it could be called the general form of all drives" (1993: 25). 13 I have taken this point from Nancy Levene's response to a NAASR panel on which I pre sented this paper.</page><page sequence="18">A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 135 (PF: 57). "Whenever a domain of subjective experience or judgment is co activated regularly with a sensorimotor domain, permanent neural connec tions are established via synaptic weight changes" (PF: 57). While these neural connections are contingent, over time "permanent connections are forged" (PF: 57). If certain embodied experiences are universal, "then the correspond ing primary metaphors are universally acquired... [as] a consequence of our brains, our bodies, and the world we inhabit" (PF: 56 and 59). Rather than contending that the mind connects successfully to the world in only one way (a la folk disciplines), Lakoff and Johnson postulate at least three different levels of embodiment. The first is "[t]he cognitive unconscious [which] makes use of and guides the perceptual and motor aspects of our bod ies" (PF: 103). The second level of embodiment is phenomenological—the 'feel' of experience. The third is neural embodiment. In keeping with develop mental systems theory, Lakoff and Johnson argue against any absolute privi leging of one level over the others. For them, no one level tells us all the truth about embodiment. Tfius rather than aspiring to explain religion in general, the metaphorical approach can direct our analysis to the middle level of spe cific phenomena (such as pain) which overlap both the biological and the cultural.14 Principle #2: The Timeless Child and the Anthropological Present "Perhaps the most important thing to understand about conceptual meta phors," enjoin Lakoff and Johnson, "is that they are used to reason with. The Love is a Journey mapping does not just permit the use of travel words to speak about love. That mapping allows forms of reasoning about travel to be used in reasoning about love.... enriching the concept of love and extending it to love-as-journey" (PF: 65; emphasis added). Such metaphors often fold cul tural particularities into neural structure (as does LeDoux). Yet while Lakoff and Johnson can acknowledge the American-ness of the Love is a Journey Metaphor, their ahistorical understanding of culture contains the pluralism that they want metaphors to provide. Their explanation focuses on the child we once were, and on some profound level still are. Invoking the child as a still point frames their analysis of culture in a timeless anthropological and literary 14 A good example of the productivity of the middle-level approach for religious studies are the essays collected in Pain and Its Transformations. This volume grew out of an interfaculty venture at Harvard that brought together natural scientists with scholars from the social sciences and the humanities to dialogue across the biology/society gap by focusing on the "strange liminal position between biology and culture" occupied by pain (Coakley and Shelemay 2007: 1). See especially the essays by Becker and Kirmayer.</page><page sequence="19">136 A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 present. They do not consider culture as a contradictory process constituted in use (Taylor 2003: 160). Lakoff and Johnson use the body much as Nietzsche suggested—as a guiding thread that leads to multiplicity. Yet the "empirically responsible phi losophy" they fashion does not share Nietzsche's taste for history. They focus on metaphors laid down in childhood as a still point rather than offering a genealogy of the different metaphors by which different cultures live. So if I argued earlier that the modular approach did not have enough body in its mind, here I argue that Lakoff and Johnson do not have enough history in their body. Consider Foucault's contention that our experience of our bodies as con tainers whose 'insides' hold organs and fluids bounded by the two-sided cover ing of skin depends on the historical practice of autopsy. The clinical body is not universal: a body of chi is not a container. Chinese acupuncture does not envision the body as bounded by its skin. Indeed, Judith Farquhar suggests that Chinese acupuncture might not have a concept of the body at all (2002: 300; 1994). I would argue that this could well be because—while physicians in ancient China knew about dissection (and occasionally even performed one)—Chinese medicine did not define the body through practices of dissec tion (Kuriyama 2002). They saw and spoke the body differently. This is what it means to say that a certain way of conjoining seeing and saying is historical. As Foucault wrote in his essay "Nietzsche Genealogy, History": "Nothing in man—not even his body—is sufficiently stable to serve as the basis for self recognition or for understanding other men" (1998: 380). In contrast, Lakoff and Johnson are sure they know, if not all of what humans are, at least a significantly stable portion: what a neural animal is and cannot do. At its heart, then, the metaphorical approach is an anthropology, in the Kantian sense of the term that Foucault spent the first decade of his career attacking: the sense that we know what the human is and can do. "More than two millennia of a priori philosophical speculation about these aspects of reason are over," Lakoff and Johnson proclaim. "Because of these discoveries, philosophy can never be the same again" (PF: 3). Their revolutionary rhetoric recalls that ofXavier Bichat, when he declared: "For twenty years, from morn ing to night, you have taken notes at patients' bedsides on affections of the heart, the lungs, and the gastric viscera; and all is confusion for you Open up a few corpses: you will dissipate at once the darkness that observation alone could not dissipate" (cited in BC: 146). With the Paris clinic, medicine "passed from an analytic perception to a perception of real analysis" in actual tissues. THAT was Bichat's genius, not re-discovering dissection: Bichat re-made both disease and death in his own image as analyst. On one hand "[djisease is</page><page sequence="20">A. Burlein / Method and Tfjeory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 137 autopsy in the night of the body," pulling apart tissues to reveal differences that normally went unseen (BC: 132). On the other hand, "[djeath is the great analyst... bursting] open the marvels of genesis in the rigor of decomposi tion" to reveal death as partial and multiple: brain, lungs, heart (BC: 147). Lakoff and Johnsons pre-emptive declarations rest, I contend, on a similarly tight link between seeing and saying. Lakoff and Johnson think they have discovered a literal instantiation of a Condillac-style link between seeing and saying: the still point of the physical projections performed by your neurons during childhood. According to Foucault, the routine practice of hospital autopsy circa the French Revolution located disease inside the body for the first time. When the scalpel's penetration was no longer experienced as assault, the clinical body was born. Similarly, Lakoff and Johnson see cognitive neuroscience as finally freeing us from the body-hating hegemony of the Cartesian mind by locating us inside—only this time not inside the body: Lakoff and Johnson locate the mind inside the material world: "Our flesh is inseparable from what Merleau Ponty called the 'flesh of the world'... Our corporeality is part of the corpore ality of the world" (PF: 565). While the modern, secular sense of bodily interiority emerged through inculcating shame, Lakoff and Johnson's embod ied mind joins up with a dimension of the cognitive science of religion that I have not yet broached: meditation and mysticism. Principle #3: Natural Mystic Five hundred and fifty pages into their book, in the final chapter, Lakoff and Johnson ask the "So what?" question. "What difference does it make if there is no such thing as a disembodied mind?" (PF: 563). Their answer shocked me: "All this matters vitally in the realm of spiritual and religious life," they declare from out of nowhere (that I could find) (PF: 563). They then give a brief, but nonetheless rich account actually, of all the religious notions that an embodied mind contradicts. "What is needed," they conclude, "is an alterna tive conception of embodied spirituality that at last begins to do justice to what people experience" (PF: 564). And what people experience as neural beings, according to Lakoff and Johnson, is transcendence: "How are we to understand our sense of being part of a larger all-encompassing whole, of ecstatic participation—with awe and respect—within that whole, and of the moral engagement within such experi ence?" Where is mystery, revelation, God? (PF: 564-65). As someone trained in religious studies, I think I can tell them: mysticism is a road that religion and science have been down before (Albanese 2007; King 1999).</page><page sequence="21">138 A. Burlein I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 Lakoff and Johnson, however, have a more timeless cultural figure in mind: "From birth we have the capacity to imitate others, to vividly imagine being another person, doing what that person does, experiencing what that person experiences. The capacity for imaginative projection is a vital cognitive fac ulty" (PF: 565). Indeed, as we saw earlier, projection and dream might well be the means by which abstract thought was able to bootstrap itself out of senso rimotor thought and behavior. Imaginative projection gives us a sense of being out of our bodies—yet it is very much a bodily capacity (PF: 565). As when we dream, so when we prepare to imitate, we vividly simulate the movements of the other by activating motor programs, while inhibiting their input to our muscles. "There is nothing mystical about it," Lakoff and Johnson declare. "Yet this most common of experiences is a form of'transcendence,' a form of being in the other ' (PF: 565). Lakoff and Johnson see religions as "meditative traditions" that have been cultivating our capacity for "focus of attention and empathetic projection... for millennia" (PF: 565-66). On one hand, this is material religion with a vengeance. On the other hand, the 'religion' in ques tion is in fact a form of perennial philosophy that has no concern with con crete human/ historical practices. In keeping with the current 'revolution in neurogenetics' and thus in con trast to the medico-philosophical thought of Bichat, Jackson and Freud, Lakoff and Johnson no longer need to pass knowledge of the human through the valley of the shadow of death. "The vehicle by which we are moved in pas sionate spirituality is metaphor. The mechanism of metaphor is bodily. It is a neural mechanism that recruits our abilities to perceive, to move, to feel, and to envision in the service not only of theoretical and philosophical thought, but of spiritual experience" (PF: 567). Thus I submit that if the secular that emerged amid the modern clinic felt like shame, the secular that arises with the neoliberal embodied mind feels like ecstatic belonging. In their liberatory lyricism, Lakoff and Johnson put me in mind of Foucault's conclusion to his History of Sexuality. "We are often reminded of the countless procedures which Christianity once employed to make us detest the body; but let us ponder all the ruses that were employed for centuries to make us love sex, to make the knowledge of it desirable and everything said about it precious" (1978: 159). Thinking analogously, I suggest that today we live amid a curious and con tinual incitement to discourse (not about sex, but) about religion: to want it, to speak of it, to explain why it is here to stay, to lament it, to believe in belief itself (the Obama campaign). If sexuality was modernity's quintessential ser mon, perhaps neoliberalism's quintessential desire is to believe in belief. By double-voicing religiosity, the scientific secular promises that empirical truth will set us free... to believe.</page><page sequence="22">A. Burlein / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 139 V. Conclusion The preceding pages have staged how two major trajectories within the cogni tive science of religion look from the vantage point of a Foucault-style history of science. From this point of view, I have shown, first, that both the modular and the metaphorical approach work by synchronizing a particular practice of perceiving with a particular practice of speech (principle #1). Second, I have shown that in contrast to Foucault's insistence on a genealogy of material human practices, both Boyer and Lakoff and Johnson elaborate biological accounts of human cognition that rest on a still point: a normal brain in a normal environment for Boyer; the timeless child for Lakoff and Johnson (principle #2). Finally, I explored how the scientific secular is entangled with religion (principle #3). Pascal Boyer explains why we have religion—still. Lakoff and Johnson enjoin us to exploit the projective capacity of our neurons by elaborating metaphors that make an ineffable God vital. Either way, cogni tive neuroscience situates itself as an active player in a more general cultural incitement to (at least discourse about) religiosity. Yet while laying bare the truth games that condition the forms of scientific discourse by which liberal democratic states govern might well lead one to oppose specific scientific practices in particular,15 showing how these three methodological moves pattern two trajectories in cognitive science by no means dismisses cognitive/ neuro-scientific accounts of religiosity. Genealo gies do not refute. Rather, by developing a practice of empiricism that directs attention to the vertical dimension of savoir, Foucault thought to make pos sible a critical practice of freedom vis-à-vis scientific truths: to enable us to resist specific scientific truth claims, not insofar as they falsely disguise ideo logical agendas, but insofar as a specific scientific way of seeing and saying is (or might be) true. Viewing biological accounts of religion through the lens of Foucault shows how neuroscience uses religion to close the body, rather than to help us understand (as Elizabeth Grosz enjoined in my opening quote) "what it is in the nature of bodies, in biological evolution ... that opens them up to... political, cultural and conceptual evolution" (2004: 2). Needless to say, we are not there yet. To write this paper was to confront how incommensurable the natural and the humans sciences still feel—even if, at the end of the day, both 'biological' and 'discursive' accounts of religiosity 15 As the Science Wars have recently demonstrated, to be against science in general is to be against nothing much; whereas to "be against the current peer review system, or against the hegemony of Big Science, or against the way in which clinical trials are constituted and funded, is to be against something substantial and important" (Shapin 2010; 44).</page><page sequence="23">140 A. Burlein I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 24 (2012) 118-142 share the 'materialist' sense that knowledge is not for understanding, but for cutting. Shared orientation in theory does not mean that we as scholars know in practice how to move beyond parallel play. Drawing on Nietzsche's discussion of the etymology of sapio, I want to conclude by suggesting that a helpful first step in constructing the kind of understanding we need would be to frame these difficulties as matters of intel lectual taste.16 For one of the primary ways that we are made into subjects of our respective disciplines who act with the appropriate manners is by cultivat ing a taste for particular objects, questions, and explanatory objectives. On one hand, the metaphor of taste has the virtue of framing these different posi tionings as situated, as matters of affect, aesthetics, and ethics (Shaviro 2009). On the other hand, if we want to understand the conjunction of biological and conceptual evolution, it is a theoretical and methodological mistake to assert the reducibility of a claim, or to deny the reducibility of a claim, "in the name of a transcendence" which implies that the person speaking "knows, in this case, what 'science' and 'politics' are, and gives or refuses to one of these terms the power to explain the other" (Stengers 2000: 16). This refusal to reduce does not require us to forgo the difficult and often obnoxious task of critiquing both science and religion. This is not the best of all possible worlds. It does, however, require us to construct a rich middle (or mediating) realm in which people trained in cultural studies can be intrigued, moved, and repulsed by biological styles of problematization—and vice versa. For in the end, method and theory are matters of movement: what moves you—with what you are capable of interacting. References Albanese, Catherine (2007).
