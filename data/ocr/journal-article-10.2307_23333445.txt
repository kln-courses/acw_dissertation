<plain_text><page sequence="1">Crossing over Horror: Reincarnation and Transformation in Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Primitive Una Chung In Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963), the entrance of a stranger into the small coastal town of Bodega Bay, California, triggers the eruption of violent attacks from birds—seagulls, crows, unidentified others. In a post trauma conversation among locals at a diner, one person points out that birds are prehistoric, unknowably alien, belonging to a geological time not contained within a human evolutionary narrative. Another person points out that there are also a lot more birds in the world than people are aware of—someone gives a number—and it seems clear that the significance of that number, in its day-to-day invisibility, is hard to fathom. Someone tries to make the number more dramatically graspable by speculating that if all birds were to rise up in a war against humans, they would be sure to win. The horror of the imagined scenario imbues the unfathomable birds with some sense of accountability, some sense-ability, even as this scenario of an interspecies war humanizes the attacks occurring in the town, which are far more enigmatic in nature. The birds follow a precise but inexplicable rhythm of attack and rest. They are propelled toward the humans in a massed onslaught of speed and force with unabated intensity until they reach a point of change in rhythm. During periods of rest, the birds seem content to perch and slowly gather into a visible mass. People move slowly and safely among the birds dur ing periods of rest, whereas energetic motion attracts the birds' attention and draws them toward people during periods of attack. Although there are deaths among birds and humans, there is no discernible narrative of murder or war, only a destructive force that obeys the rhythms of a score that we cannot hear. It is hard to see a concerted goal behind the force, much less any intentional character such as malice; there is only violence WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly 40:1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Summer 2012) reserved. © 2012 by Una Chung.

Most of the bloodshed comes from bird bodies shattering against and through windows of buildings, phone booths, car windshields. There is rather an uncanny responsiveness between bodies of birds and humans that unfolds through the film. People are able to fall into step with the rhythm of attack and rest in order to make their own escape from the besieged town. The stranger from the city, Melanie, displays taut calm, a mixture of alertness and relaxation that is crucial to her survival. In the schoolyard, she notices with shock the sudden amassing of birds behind her, yet without panic she immediately intuits that it is not about being seen but about being sensed. She moves slowly and gracefully, her face remaining tense but calm, and enters the school to warn the children. Only when she loses complete touch with the rhythm of the birds and gives in to restless urges, instead of remaining still, does she finally fall victim to a violent attack, which leaves her catatonic. The birds thus seem to demonstrate certain qualities of the viral: invis ible, too small, too many, overly mobile, movement signifying contagion, alien reminders of a world not ruled by humans. Hitchcock's film gives us an image of the viral as an image of horror. Without horror, birds remain singly or in pairs in their cages, taught to mimic human words, or bred in chicken coops and given feed. The film does not indulge in arbitrary fanta sies of birds escaping into the wild or gaining human cognitive ambitions such as waging modern war. Hitchcock's birds do not present us with an image of anthropomorphic horror but of a human fear of the viral. These birds evoke horror through a play of numbers and visibility. In the scene where Melanie waits at the schoolyard, we see one bird, then three, then another three, land behind her. We look ahead with her at a single bird fly ing in the sky and track the arc of its descent behind her, when suddenly we see that the space is thick with birds perched on all available bars and rail ings. The absence of solid structures in the image enhances the effect of the birds' filling up all empty space, a quality of something unseen suddenly made visible. The famous and oft-discussed soundtrack and the repetitive chant of the children singing, underscore the period of rest, the boredom, the slow rhythms of accumulation, which lead to the massed onslaught. In a later scene, after the explosion of a car at a gas station, the camera jumps to a high aerial view above the bay, and from behind the camera, a bird drops down into view, followed by another, and then a mass of birds covers the sky.</page><page sequence="3">Crossing over Horror 213 For Slavoj Zizek, the camera's "God's perspective" above the bay clears the screen of any possible human subjective point of view, which is then used to bring our vision direcdy into alignment with the viewpoint of the attacking birds (2010,236). According to Zizek, we are thus made to expe rience the horror of looking from the vantage point of murderous agency We realize that it is for our gaze that the spectacle of violence has been staged. We imagined ourselves innocently looking for visual pleasure but discover a murderous drive within. If we wish to understand why in this film "every relationship of partnership is either doomed to fail or totally void of libidinal content" then we must look to the "massive, oppressive material presence" of the birds, which "gives body to the impossible jouis sance" (9). There is nothing to see in that moment when the camera brings us into alignment with the absolute gaze, but there is something to be felt, understood, in that moment of horror: the presence of something inhu man that sees through our own seeing. Our own points of view are not closed circuits within our being but cracks opening onto our world from something utterly alien. Hitchcock's camera in The Birds embodies the same drive as "mon sters, cyborgs, the living dead . . . machines which run blindly, without compassion, devoid of any 'pathological' considerations, inaccessible to our pleas ... yet at the same time ... defined by the presence of an abso lute gaze" (Zizek 2010, 256). The eruption of birds from the pure gaze of Hitchcock's camera suggests that "this Otherness ultimately coincides with the machine (camera) itself" (256). The drive of the id—the essence of the animatedness of the human body that terrifies us in its deafness to the socially determined nature of our desires—can be materialized not simply in the allegory of the birds as attacking Furies but directly in the camera's capacity to produce the horror of the absolute gaze. This techno logical capacity is linked, for Zizek, to psychosis: "This dream of a drive that could function without its representative in the psychic apparatus is what one is tempted to baptize the psychotic core of Hitchcock's universe—a core strictly homologous to Freud's dream of a moment when the sym bolic procedure of psychoanalysis will be replaced by pure biology" (241). This fantasy of "pure biology," or perhaps the pure machine of posthuman ism, augurs the "collapse of the very field of intersubjectivity as medium of Truth in late capitalism" and with it the end of psychoanalysis (262).1 There is a cruelty in Zizek's writing—the cruelty of a Lacanian ana lyst—when he writes, "The public fascination with figures like Hannibal</page><page sequence="4">214 Una Chung Lecter, the cannibal serial killer from Thomas Harris's novels, provides a ray of hope: this fascination ultimately bears witness to a deep longing for a Lacanian psychoanalyst" (262). The "ray of hope" may allow psycho analysis to continue providing "symbolic integration of our traumas" but there is never any hint about how we might cross over horror. For Zizek, horror is in fact essential; it is the only cut to an outside—one that shows us precisely that there can be no outside within the enclosure of global capitalism. It seems to me that Zizek's investment in insisting on a certain structural critique of capitalism in fact curtails the power of his analysis of horror and closes off the creative potential of the future of psychoanalysis. We might articulate the political critique differently—not against capital but rather toward the cultivation of new practices (which produce new socials). Patricia Clough wonders whether psychoanalysis and tech noscience could not be reconfigured together by an "imagination of a criti cal practice capable of a more direct engagement with semiotic-material objects" (2000, 184). In fact, Clough suggests that a certain genealogy of thought that moves from feminist critiques of technoscience through Jacques Derrida to Sigmund Freud will uncover the very technical sub strates of the unconscious: "Freud refused to describe the nervous system as compartments for storing memories; instead his description proposed that the nervous system is a substrate in motion" (33). Derrida not only "turns Freud's mystic writing-pad into a perpetual motion machine," but also in effect begins to unfold the technical substrate onto "a distributed network of transmissions without beginning or end" (38). We are led by deconstruction of nature and culture to a point where the fine between human and machine becomes indecipherable. But it is here that decon struction too stalls. There is a different blockage of love at work here; Clough will call it love of television, a machine that she imagines Derrida was "unable to embrace." Derrida could see in Freud's use of the metaphor of the mystic writing pad a presentiment of the technical substrates of the unconscious but was unable to articulate fully what it would mean for human life to see so directly into its own mutability—not simply through evolutionary time but directly in its own momentary affective fluctuations. Could we (bear to) see our horror released into waves of nervous energy and quanta of attention? Could we forego using our psychosis to condemn the complicity of technology and capital, and simply invent new practices of living that engender different social worlds? To love television is not about being an avid consumer but rather is a way of saying that we might</page><page sequence="5">Crossing over Horror 215 loosen our grip on the containment, or securitization, of human identity connected to our belief in fixed ontological categories that ignore the technical substrates of the unconscious. "Derrida hesitates. He turns back from ontology or turns ontology to the historical production of technol ogy" (40). This second turn, away from the machine he had begun to turn Freud toward, is so often where our understanding of technology seems fated to begin—with the line between history of production and life of human being. Technology becomes a problem with objects rather than of our own becoming across multiple life forms and life times, beyond the limited borders of individualism? Keith Ansell Pearson attempts to chart a path between the extremes of technophilia and technophobia toward a reconceptualization of viral life. Pearson objects to the naturalization of technological evolution, and the new "theology of capital" that justifies "life's evolution leading in the direc tion of nonaffective machines, in which thought exists without a body," and where "there is no future of, or for, invention, since all is given" (1997, 2). At the same time, Pearson makes clear, "Neither do I adhere to fanta sies of historical revolution in which we humans will reclaim our rightful control and mastery over nature and society," which have inspired major thinkers such as Herbert Marcuse, Guy Debord, and Fredric Jameson (3). For Pearson, the "desire for complete historical immanence" as much as "our contemporary cyberspace gurus" inspire "dread and loathing," real horror (3). Rather than succumb to psychosis, however, Pearson advo cates, for contemporary thinkers, a dousing by Nietzschean nihilism, a suicidal, sobering, and unflattering coming to terms with "the culminating point of Western narcissism and humanism" (7). The task today is no longer to seek God, dead or alive... but to be drawn to the land of the future where human impotence no longer makes us mad and where it is possible to decode the signs of alien life within and with out us. For this we do not so much require new truths, rather it becomes necessary to remember and relearn some ancient ones. One will then discover them as if for the first time, for there is only the "first" time that is repeated again and again. The future, for example, has always been "out there."' It does not simply lie ahead of us. It is the place of the "out side." (7-8; my emphasis) If I might read for poetic nuance, as it were, I would suggest that Pear son invites us to think of the human as a realm of being (rather than an ontological truth) and the future as the name for a different land, where</page><page sequence="6">216 Una Chung "human impotence no longer makes us mad" (my emphasis). There is indeed to be a crossing over horror, a place beyond the paradoxical "truth" of psychosis that claims madness can be the only true experience of rec ognizing the impossibility of (human) truth. In a land of sanity, call it the future, "machines provide pathic and cartographic access to a plurality of beings and worlds" (Pearson 1997, 6). We understand ourselves to be sharing in viroid life—a "figure for the indeterminacy of life itself and of the complexity of the evolutionary process" (Lynch 1999, 120). It is not the virus that threatens us but our "narrative of teleological biological and technological progress" that claims the virus as a threat to itself (119). The image of "viroid life" necessitates that we consider the nonlinear transfer of information between more highly evolved and less highly evolved species (Pearson 1997, 133).3 This is due to not simply the "new truths" of sci ence but perhaps also the "ancient ones" of repetition and difference and, I would add, karma and rebirth. We are currently living at a time when digital technologies, algorith mic design, and ecosensibilities are producing environments that do not resemble the inhuman machines of yesterday s future, "the living dead," but rather animated affective beings—responsive architecture, sensual machines and mobile devices, global networks of information that move at the speed of thought. What terrifies us today is not the idea that these material appearances of animatedness are at their core not human or not really alive. What we do painfully lack is a form of subjectivity (other than "hyper-self-reflexivity") adequate to what we feel we actually are and a common notion of life adequate to our experience of today's lived environ ments. We remain fascinated by the voice of Zizek, perhaps, for he seems to offer us the unfeeling (dead) eye of god, at a time when we find ourselves surrounded by endless screens that capture our attention for seemingly no purpose at all—the truism of the pure productivity of capitalism not being sufficient answer. Clough implicitly raises the question of whether horror might not serve a purpose other than to provoke self-destructive imma nent critique (revolution over capitalism), instead directing us toward shock (or trauma) as a site where we can reencounter "the play of the dif ferences of preontological forces" (Clough 2000, 40). Bound up in social formations of familial relations are also "agencies immanent to matter." The social organization of production is not the only access point into new political futures. Rather than horror, which is oriented by our attachment to a certain historical configuration of the social (an attachment to histori</page><page sequence="7">Crossing over Horror 217 cal norms of sanity and humanity), we might find Cloughian psychoanaly sis showing us that "technology crosses through ontology."4 The Birds leaves us with an enigmatic image of Melanie's face that sug gests not only horror but also the Open, the future. Her face is impassive; her eyes are open but no longer looking onto the same world as those of the others fussing around her and busily enjoying their symbolic integra tion, so to speak. Assured of the reality of a murderous violence greater than her own, Mitch's mother gives up her own small measure of resent ment and gives Melanie a small hug. Mitch's sister continues to disavow what has occurred by remaining attached to her caged lovebirds—"They haven't harmed anyone!" Mitch himself drives determinedly away with his brood under his paternal care. The film gives narrative closure to these three characters, who happily return to a semblance of a larger society, San Francisco. But for Melanie, there is only indetermination. What does she see? What will come after? It seems important to see in this face a real startling openness—provoked not through the manipulations of horror (speculation about what we cannot see), but through a strange stillness, an uncertainty about what rhythms she hears now. Hers is not the dead eye of Marion's corpse in Psycho but a nonreactive eye that continues to look for ward to what is to come—a bird's eye. "It is not clear what future will come beyond the future given with the unconscious thought of teletechnology. It is being written; no doubt somewhere it is just starting itself up. In fits and starts, across mystic writing-pads, it is producing bodies, assemblages of scenes, screens, and moving machines" (Clough 2000,186-87). Can there be a crossing over horror? Does viroid life open us up to ways of thinking about birth and death beyond the horror of self-witnessing? Are there aesthetic practices that can lighten the impulse toward horror accompanying our glimpse of life beyond rational sight? Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Primitive project, including the feature film UncleBoonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (2010) and the multime dia installation of Primitive, consisting of eight videos and one print, shifts the ground from under the composition of horror by exploring how rein carnation and transformation might provide us with a different aesthetic form for understanding subjectivity and technicity.5 Primitive explores the condition of memory in the rural village of Nabua in northeast Thailand, near the border of Laos. Nabua was occupied by the Thai military from the 1960s to the 1980s during an aggressive repression of communism. The</page><page sequence="8">218 Una Chung violent treatment of sympathetic Nabua farmers and their families by the military caused many to flee to the jungle. Foregoing the trope of witness ing (and its basis in self-reflexivity), Weerasethakul approaches the vexed issue of political history and collective trauma in Nabua through dream, time travel, reincarnation, and transformation.6 Weerasethakul does not seek to remedy or even remediate the politi cal history of Nabua by transmitting knowledge of local memory into universal archives or twittering incendiary accusations to the public; nor will he shake the locals into horrified rememory of the traumas of the past by staging confrontations among different groups and generations.7 In response to the question "Did the experience of making the installa tion change the relationship the residents of Nabua have with their past?" Weerasethakul answers, "I don't think so. I hope not. The idea was not to change" (Carrion-Murayari and Gioni 2011, 12). "The important thing was that we lived" (12). We meet the isolated teens of Nabua and live with them for a moment in the gallery installation of Primitive, where they are seen sometimes in military fatigues and ambiguously dramatic tableau vivants and at other times freely at play in casual jeans and T-shirts—run ning, dancing, wrestling, and building a time machine for travel to the future. To live directly the nonlinear temporal entanglement of the pres ent moment, without concertedly tracking past or future, is in fact a potent way to engage the challenge of remembering political history, that is, by liv ing it, as it finds us, knowing that we are embedded in it in ways more com plex and nonarbitrary than our conscious knowledge of time might lead us to think. This complex relationship of Boonmee and the teens of Nabua (and of ourselves) is figured artistically through Weerasethakuls use of dif ferent media: media as bodies of time, bodies of time as relations of speed/ stillness, and relations of affect (i.e., surprise of encounter) replacing fixed social relations of kinship or political antagonism. Nabua (2009) gives us a striking composition of visual and audio shocks—flashes of lightning and incandescent smoke, accompanied by loud explosive cracking. The incredible force transmitted by this film does not lead to violence. Shock is accompanied by a different rhythm of slow movement, a sense of turning and expanding from the edges—not a back ing up or darting forward by a seeing body but an expansion of the field of vision. It is as if the world were slowly revolving on its vertical axis with a gentle sliding sideways along the horizontal. A Dedicated Machine (2009) presents a still horizon where a near-spherical object (a time machine</page><page sequence="9">Crossing over Horror 219 rather than the sun) slowly moves up and down: it is within a nonlinear temporality that dreams may cross the technical substrate of the uncon scious. Together these (dis) orient the dark gallery space of Primitive, which we enter not as into a building encoded by the urgent necessities of social navigation, but rather to experience a state of mind akin to sleep, permit ting dreams, the rhythmic attunement to films and videos that merge with our own "impressions of light and memory." Within this space, the local teens of Nabua are presented as figures of the future. They are given a claim on the future that Thai society does not offer them. Boonmee, the titular character of the feature film, travels to the future in a dream on the brink of his death and meets the Nabua teens. A cinematic character, who killed communists for the Thai military, and real descendants of the disappeared in Nabua thus meet in the land of the future, amid Boonmees recollec tion of past lives. This is one example of the kinds of encounters that arise within the space of Primitive. These do not resemble the uncanny travels of Gulliver or a vision of Utopia, but rather suggest the play of memory, free from one who remembers: a loosening of individuals into indefinite features, qualities, and affects that can quickly cross among different media, genres, bodies, and times. To remember a past life means to be no longer bound by the individual constraints of memory and subjectivity and, there fore, to be open to the present livingness of infinite traces of other lives crossing through one and gathering together unexpected capacities to act. This same quality is demonstrated with incredible simplicity and power merely through the use of light and screen in the film Phantoms of Nabua (2009). Phantoms of Nabua (2009) consists almost entirely of constantly changing qualities and movements of light. The camera seems unable to show us anything but light: a lone fluorescent light against the dark sky; a dark projector screen where flashes of lightning strike the ground and plumes of bright white smoke erupt, allowing ghostly build ings to flash into view; a wide-angle shot of a large empty space with single fluorescent light above, screen small in the background, and flickers of deep red embers of fire appearing toward the front. A ball of flames jumps into view within the darkness, and the shuffling noise of teens playing soccer with the fireball becomes audible. The scene intensifies as the flaming ball whizzes to the left then to the right, while voices call out to each other in the dark, and bodies only rarely and fragmentarily light up in the red glow of fire. The screen in the background is barely visible but for the flashes of light that appear on it, until the fireball makes contact and sets the screen</page><page sequence="10">220 Una Chung aflame. The teens gather around the screen after it catches fire and kick the flaming ball back and forth through the gaping hole that emerges from the disintegrating screen. The light of the projector behind the screen becomes nakedly visible (we realize that it had always been visible as a sphere of light on the screen) and the rhythms of its flickering cone of light capture the cameras attention. The darkness of this film makes it impossible for us to do anything but chase the light with our eyes. The film does not frame our vision so much as modulate our perception in relation to the qualities of light. The camerawork and editing are not crafted in order to produce a point of view, a particular body looking. The rhythms of the bodies and voices of the young men playing soccer are inseparable from the rhythms of light passing across or jumping different media. Through this astonish ing work with light, film apparatus, and screen, we could say that we are given back to the play of preontological forces. The phantoms of Nabua are not fixed onto a historical past or a historically limited form. Perhaps the image of ourselves that we have been seeking is not the chalk line around a human form but this quality of light that is undeniably materially present and yet can move directly among lamp, screen, fire, projector, and image. Light is that which can cross different mediating bodies—not without dying—yet indestructible. For Weerasethakul, "better than cinema is the light itself" (qtd in Carrion-Murayari and Gioni 2011,14). "The installation is like flashes of dreams where you sift through with your own pace. They are remnants of a performance. I am fine when peo ple say that they sleep through my movies. They wake up and can patch things up in their own way" (Apichatpong Weerasethakul qtd. in Carrion Murayari and Gioni 2011, 14). Whereas previously we noted the viselike grip of Zizek's eye watching The Birds, here we encounter a filmmaker who invites us to find our own rhythms of falling asleep and waking up within the space of his work. It seems that horror has an intimate link to the desire to witness one's own birth or death, one's own falling asleep and awaken ing. This impulse has drawn to itself the pornographic capacities of visual media technologies that purport to show us our own (Oedipal) blindness, or even the cultural drive to trace the "forensic materiality" of digital infor mation (Kirschenbaum 2008). The historical birth of a particular medium seems less important than the dominant desire that comes to shape its mode of perception. Clough could see in television's capacity to simul taneously record and transmit images a glimpse of subjectivity enfolded with technology in ways resonant with the perpetual motion of the decon</page><page sequence="11">Crossing over Horror 221 structive process that allows us to see nature and culture as both distinct and inseparable. Where deconstruction hesitates (in perpetual vacilla tion), Weerasethakul moves forward assuredly, though gently, into an aes thetic sensibility that crosses beyond the point from which one can look in both directions, and moves through reincarnation and transformation into the land of the future. Beyond capitalist systems of exchange, there are other paths by means of which life changes forms and changes hands. If the automatic subjectivity of capital was the archetype of the hysteri cal subject, who insisted on self-identity and self-increase, we may need to reroute our sensibilities through the viral passage among human, animal, machine, god, and ghost, who appear through the action of birth, death, and rebirth). We might give up the perpetuity of horror for the simple rhythms of life and death. We may need to learn strategies of attunement and affective rhythms that can more directly engage a mind that we now, finally, again, for the first time, understand is—crossing over horror—not at all our own (and never was).

Elsaesser s rationalist approach explores the impli cations of a technologically determined unconscious without taking up the ontological question raised by Derrida's deconstruction of "an assumed opposition between the psychical and the nonpsychical, life and death" (qtd. in Clough 2000,40).
