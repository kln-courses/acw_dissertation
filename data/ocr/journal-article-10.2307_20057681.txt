<plain_text><page sequence="1">"And the Wind Wheezing Through That Organ Once in a While": Voice, Narrative, Film Andrew Gibson Toward the end of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, when Cranly asks Stephen Dedalus for his "point of view," Stephen responds, in a famous passage: "I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use?silence, exile, and cunning."1 Why should "silence" be one of the three conditions of what Stephen projects as his venture into self-expression? The word is usually interpreted as indicat ing part of a strategy for survival. Yet insofar as such a strategy is at stake in the word "cunning," at least, Cranly promptly calls its appropriateness to Stephen into question. The silence at issue can also be understood in contradistinction to the voices indicated everywhere in Portrait. These are certainly voices that insist on conviction or claim allegiance, that carry an ideological freight. But they are also voices as they make themselves heard in the world around Stephen. The world of Stephen's Dublin is notoriously full of voices, a fact which Joyce underlined, in particular, in the "Aeolus" chapter in Ulysses. "Silence," then, is one of Stephen's ways of declaring a necessary distance between himself and Irish culture. It is as important to him in this respect as is "exile." In effect, though, this silence is equivalent to writing. For Stephen (and for Joyce), like exile, the silence of writing is a repudiation of a present and presences. This silence will be even more crucial and determining for the art in question than any set of emotions felt for the present (emotions that were surely extremely complicated, in Joyce's case). As in the art of the Dante who was so significant for him, the silence of Joyce's art establishes a historical and critical distance from his subject. This distance is the measure of an intransigent political difference. In both instances, it is the violence of voices that is partly what is consigned to the crypt. Thus art abandons its subject matter to a "desert" of silence, in the sense in which the later Derrida deploys the metaphor of the desert: "This critique [Specters of Marx] belongs to the movement of an experience New Literary History, 2001, 32: 639-657</page><page sequence="2">640 NEW LITERARY HISTORY open to the absolute future of what is coming, that is to say, a necessarily indeterminate, abstract, desert-like experience that is confided, ex posed, given up to its waiting for the other and for the event."2 To a certain degree, the work of Dante and Joyce performs a similar critique precisely in silencing a present or endowing it with the particular kind of muteness possessed by literary narrative. Insofar as the passage from Portrait is about the conditions of (narrative) art, then, it is concerned to specify one of them as the renunciation of voice and of a world of voices. Literary art is the tomb of speech. It may pervasively mimic speech, may serve as a memorial to, record of, or testimony to speech or words spoken. That does not crucially change matters. To Roland Barthes's famous question as to who speaks in the text, the answer, it would seem, is no one, ever. There are in fact no narrative voices and no voices in literary narrative, whether the voices of authors, narrators, or personae. Insofar as the term "voice" is used to designate any feature of literary narrative, when its status is neither linguistic nor technical, that status is at once metaphorical. This is the case with both classic and recent theoretical accounts of the novel. Wayne Booth, for example, demanded a renewed respect for the authorial or narrative voice in the text. But his concern to reinstate the writer who "speaks" in his or her own voice was from the start inseparable from a valuation of "authoritative rhetoric" and moral certainty.3 Indeed, the determination with which Booth strove to rein state the classical concept of narrative "telling" was precisely connected to his insistence on the crucial importance of narrative authority. But voice need not be a conservative metaphor. In Susan Lanser's more recent elaboration of a feminist narratology, for example, it is rather "a trope of identity and power" for "the collectively and personally si lenced."4 What nonetheless remains constant from Booth to Lanser is the practice of metaphorization itself. Indeed, the term "practice" hardly seems appropriate: what is at stake is a tradition of metaphorization so deeply entrenched as apparently to have forgotten the very difference between the literal and the metaphorical. Literary theory and criticism, then?and, perhaps above all, narrative theory and criticism?have found it hard to contemplate the meta phoricity of "voice." In narrative theory, the term long ago worked free of any material reference. Indeed, even when theory and criticism have deployed the term "voice" with a linguistic specificity or technical precision, they have more or less tacitly continued to associate it with human presences, a humanistic construction of experience or familiar humanist values. This is the case, for example, with much of Monika Fludernik's work. Part at least of its distinction has been due to the sophistication of the new and complex linguistic models which Fludernik</page><page sequence="3">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 641 has brought to the study of narrative: the use, for example, in Towards a "Natural" Narrato fogy, of natural linguistics?Nat?rlichkeitstheorie?as asso ciated with Wolfgang Dressier and the Austrian school linked with his name. But Fludernik also resorts to a concept of "natural" narrative as the unelicited, spontaneous storytelling analyzed by William Labov.5 Indeed, this is Fludernik's point of departure and a principal point of reference. But this concept of narrative begs the question the distance between analyzing subject and analyzed object, a distance which neces sarily renders problematic all assumptions of the "spontaneity" ("natu ralness") of what is analyzed. Neither Labov or Fludernik confronts this issue. But it is only by avoiding it that Fludernik can continue to promote a concept of the "embodiedness" of the voice as an unprob lematic given; indeed, a given apparently immune to historical change and transformation. This in its turn makes it possible for her to characterize natural narrative in terms of "its universality, its transcultural existence and significance."6 In fact, as I have pointed out in an account of her earlier The Fictions of Language and the Languages of Fiction, beyond a certain point, for Fludernik, voice ceases to be an object of empirical enquiry and assumes ontological status.7 Thus we come back, at length, to a familiar humanism, a humanism that reappears as part of, as even, perhaps, the unacknowledged foundation of a sophisticated, contempo rary methodology rooted in what is, in Fludernik's case, a formidable, contemporary, linguistic expertise.8 But the persistence of humanism even in the most advanced, contem porary, narratological work is scarcely surprising: the humanistic tradi tion of letters has frequently not only survived its opponents' arguments without refuting them, but survived quite comfortably within them. Humanists would find it hard indeed to relinquish the belief that they "hear" a text (or, perhaps better, that what they "hear" is the text). The dream of "hearing" the other in the text is precisely intrinsic to the intimate self-communion that is reading. In my 1996 study Towards a Postmodern Theory of Narrative, I argued for a wholesale deconstruction of the system of classical narratology insofar as the latter has always been a "theological" system, in the Derridean sense; that is, insofar as it has always been a "centred structure" and presented the object of its inquiry as such (TPT 19-22). Narratology has been what Derrida calls a geometries.9 At the same time, it has instituted and everywhere promoted a geometries of the narrative text. Yet this geometries has invariably functioned in relation to a "fixed point" or center which Derrida suggests is inseparable from the classical thought of "structure" itself (TPT 19). The narratological conception of voice has been an instance of a peculiarly powerful assertion of the "fixed point" or center within narrative theory.</page><page sequence="4">642 NEW LITERARY HISTORY In G?rard Genette's work, for example, claims as to the scientific purity of narratological method are notably compromised by his insist ence that "every narrative resonates with voice."10 Genette never problematizes this insistence. While the manifestations of voice can be classified, voice itself simply exists as an essence. The Genettian insist ence sustains what Derrida calls the theological privilege of the phone? and, together with it, a particular valuation of reason, the conscious will, the self-identity of consciousness, the certitude and unity of inner existence?within narrative theory. The assertion of the power of voice implicit in narratology has held the specters of difference and non presence at bay. It has maintained subject and object, language and meaning in a space untroubled by either specter. The great German narratologist F. K. Stanzel was responsible for a preeminently complex and precise account of the narrative system. Yet he, too, begins the very first chapter of his A Theory of Narrative with the assertion that "whenever something is reported, there is a mediator?the voice of a narrator is audible."11 There is apparently no disputing the audibility of mediation as a guarantee of full presence. Here, again, narratology resorts to voice to ground a technology of the text on to reassuringly ontotheological foundations. In this respect as in others, it has been an idealism. But at this point, a Derridean caveat is important: to identify what had appeared to be a self-evident given as an idealist construction is not to assume that we can immediately and decisively progress beyond the idealism in question. Indeed, the structure that opposes the two?self evident given and idealist construction?and assumes the possibility of a categorical decision whereby the one "supersedes" the other, is itself idealist. Thus in Towards a Postmodern Theory of Narrative, in contradistinc tion to the classical conception of narrative voice as Geist, I argued for a materialism of narrative voice. But the materialism in question is not to be simply opposed to the idealism of narratological tradition, as though it could promptly take us beyond the latter. Following Derrida, I argued that voice is never self-contained or wholly present to itself, wholly "pure and free" in its spontaneity.12 Rather, "discontinuity, delay, heterogeneity and alterity" are always "working upon the voice, producing it from its first breath as a system of differential traces."131 followed the line of a familiar, Derridean case. Writing, I suggested, might be thought of as in some sense interior to voice: it does not simply "come after" voice, as an expression, reflection, or evocation of the latter. As dijf?rance?as a system of differences and delays that are constitutive of sense?it also precedes the voice and its presumed spontaneity, dislocating it and alienating it from itself.14 Narrative voice may be thought of precisely in terms of this play of the materiality of writing within it. In thinking thus, theory might hope to break the bond that I have just noted, with</page><page sequence="5">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 643 reference to Fludernik's and Stanzel's work, between narratology as a scientific or quasi-scientific practice, and a humanism that will not call in question its own residual on to theological structure. What I have just said, however, hardly seems to square with the argument I set out at the beginning of this essay. To think of voice as inhabited by writing is not to disallow voice. It is not to proclaim narrative to be the tomb of speech. But a question underlies this inconsistency: the issue of whether it is currently possible to think narrative without thinking voice. Do we know how to attend to the muteness of narrative, how not to hear it? To suggest that the term "voice" is always a metaphor is not ipso facto to diminish its power, or that of the discourses for which it is significant. The power in question is insistent even for?and within?those discourses that most intently seek to lay it bare (including this essay). In other words, if my argument thus far has been inconsistent, its inconsistency is indicative of a larger irrationality or paradox: effective critique does not automatically put an end to its object. The object survives, not least, within the discourse of critique itself. That literature is the tomb of speech, then, does not mean that, for us, at least, it is not haunted by voices. The crypt is also an echo chamber. If, on the one hand, in narrative, writing inhabits the voice, on the other, voice becomes "spectral," an emanation from an "impossible body." My terms here derive from Derrida, and the recent work of the French philosopher Jacques Ranci?re. In the first instance, it is impor tant to recognize that, in their insistence on the resonance of voice within narrative, narrative theory and, in particular, narratology have always implicitly constituted what Derrida calls a "spectropoetics." Narratology especially has secured and indeed widened the gap, initially established by structuralism, between narrative and world. The corollary of the narratological "technology of narrative" has been a reduction of the "life in literature," at least, in the sense that its formalism has frequently extended and developed the structuralist interrogation of the representational illusion. But narratology also reinstates the "life in literature" in "ghostly" form, of which the "spectral voice" has been a principal component. This is precisely evident, for example, in the work of Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan. On the one hand, she wishes to distinguish very clearly between what she calls the "narrative communication situation" and the "real life" world of the "flesh-and-blood author." She does so, indeed, with sufficient rigor to quarrel with Seymour Chatman in asserting that the so-called "implied author" is not "a speaker or a voice" but merely "a set of implicit norms."15 But why should this be the case with the implied author and not with the narrator, whose "voice" Rimmon-Kenan does not problematize? This voice is no more that of a "flesh-and-blood"</page><page sequence="6">644 NEW LITERARY HISTORY figure inhabiting a "real life world" than the implied author's. Why should it be granted a distinctive status? Here, in fact, as pervasively, narrative theory becomes what Derrida calls a "spectrogenic process" (SM 126). Having acquiesced in the structuralist project of tearing narrative as idea or thought loose from the materiality of the world it represents, in Derridean terms, narratology then incorporates "auton omized spirit" into narrative as voice (SM 126). It thus institutes its own version of the Eskamotage or conjuring trick which Derrida associates with phenomenology (SM 128). The phenomenological Eskamotage is an instance of a process by which a modern thought or science brings about the disappearance of a traditional object of thought, study, or inquiry, only to reinstitute that object at another, less crudely material or more "ghostly" level. As in the case of Rimmon-Kenan, narratology has produced its own version of the process, what might be thought of as the narratological Eskamotage, not least, in its treatment of voice. In fact, then, narratology insistently puts into question the mimetic premise on which the concept of narrative voice or voice in narrative depends. But it continues to cling to that concept itself. This double bind is what we have to work with. There is no question of a return to a mythical state of innocence before narrative theory, nor of any move decisively beyond its legacy. It is as much a "spectral" legacy as is, for Derrida in a very different context, the contemporary legacy of Marx. The question?perhaps particularly in the case of voice?is of how to work with ghosts. In Derrida's terms, it is a question of choice: which part or parts of the ghostly legacy remain useful, and how might they be most effectively deployed? The introduction of the Derridean concep tion of "spectrality" into narrative theory might encourage theorists to think of narrative and narrative voice in specifically deconstructive terms. Such terms would seek to avoid "the sharp distinction between the real and the unreal, the actual and the inactual, the living and the non-living, being and non-being ... in the opposition between what is present and what is not, for example in the form of objectivity" (SM 11). However, in the present context, and given my argument with reference to Joyce at the beginning of this essay, I want rather to turn to Ranci?re. In a developing and increasingly impressive range of work whose chief focus is the nineteenth century, Ranci?re has returned insistently to the theme of the realm of literature as that of "sensation without feeling" (la sensation insensible).16 In narrative, above all, as found in the novel, "the reader sees without seeing."17 For all the painstaking care with which Dostoevsky paints Raskolnikov's room or Flaubert Charles Bovary's famous casquette, we will never see either. But it is precisely this paradoxical condition, this "limit of realism" ('?chec' du r?alisme), as Ranci?re has it, that is the reason for the success of novelistic narrative.</page><page sequence="7">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 645 The liberty of narrative is inextricable from the d?calage that it operates between two kinds of seeing, material and immaterial, which Ranci?re calls vision and voyance. It is tied to nothing already given. Language in narrative therefore can no longer be precisely "placed." (It becomes indisponible.) For it is bound to no specific object. What holds good for seeing also holds good for hearing. Indeed, Ranci?re 's concern with the relationship between literature and materi ality crystallizes with particular clarity around a concern with voice and the auditory. Ranci?re argues that the novel is the supreme vehicle of the speechless voice, the "language both mute and loquacious [la parole muette et bavarde]9' that is intrinsic to literature (PM86). The language in question may be contrasted with an aesthetic that runs from the seventeenth century to the revolution and beyond. This aesthetic is well illustrated in Voltaire's description of French theater in the 1630s as "the mirror of an art of social living where the art of speaking is at the heart of a general rhetoric [une rh?torique g?n?rale] whose principal reflectors [principaux r?flecteurs] are the arts of writing and painting" (PM 26).18 Such a subordination of literature to an art of speech and a rh?torique g?n?rale is subverted only in the nineteenth century, as literature sepa rates itself as parole muette from functional language, la parole efficace, and turns to contemplate itself as writing. The nineteenth century sees a decisive intellectual shift in which literature frees itself from the tyranny of voice, which always carries implications of possession, property, authority, identity, source, or origin. In doing so, literature recognizes what in fact was always its own freedom as ?criture, no one's sole possession, available to all. This is not to identify the condition of literature as one of silent aloofness. Sartre identifies writing?as in the case of Flaubert?with an Olympian, disdainful remoteness from the crowd. But he is mistaken: he ignores the fact that writing is its own form of bavardage, a kind of ghostly chatter that troubles and disturbs "any relationship in which discourse appears legitimately to belong to a given instance of enunciation" (PM 82). A specific politics of writing is at stake, here. The humanistic insistence on the voice produces the text as plenitude. It "fills it in" or completes it, secures it as "legitimately belonging" to a speaker. The concept of voice authenticates the text as living presence. By and large, narratology has served only to confirm the results of this process. By contrast, Ranci?re conceives of the condition of the literary text or writing as one of incompletion. Plato and Hegel both recognize this condition, but find in it a reason for the derogation of writing. For Ranci?re, however, incompletion?the insistence that there is "more to come"?is what gives writing its political dimension.19 On the one hand, Plato was right in the Republic: writing is an unruly, disruptive, orphan child. It is not</page><page sequence="8">646 NEW LITERARY HISTORY subject to any founding authority, as is spoken language. Hence its inescapably oblique or dissonant relationship with the principles of legitimacy and order obtaining in the community; hence too the fact that the literary text is always open to further reading. On the other hand, epic stands opposed to writing: for Hegel (particularly the Hegel so important for Luk?cs), the condition of epic is "the exact adequation [Vexacte ad?quation] of poetic power to its native soil or milieu" (PM 62). But poetry after epic (or, for Luk?cs, the novel as it succeeds epic) is universal only in so far as it is incomplete. The condition of writing is a desire for or expectation of totality. But this condition is neither dangerous, as Plato would have it, nor nostalgic, as in (Luk?cs's) Hegel. Writing looks towards, calls to, even anticipates a future. Indeed, it does so in that, like prophecy, it is a kind of vision without seeing, audition without hearing. It does so as a parole muette that awaits its embodiment, its becoming flesh. It is precisely as such, and in its unassimilable relation to the future, its pure refusal to be reduced to the terms of the present, that the political force, the political determination of writing is most powerfully at stake. In this respect, to adopt two crucial terms from La chair des mots, narrative is fig?ralas well as figurative. For Ranci?re, the two conceptions of narrative are evident in Auerbach's Mimesis on the one hand, and Kermode's The Genesis of Secrecy on the other. They are specifically exemplified in Auerbach's and Kermode's accounts of the Gospel according to Mark. In Auerbach's figurative reading, in the Gospel the word is made flesh, the idea made present. Gestures, speech, events become intelligible in relation to the ontology and teleology of a "hidden scheme [arri?re-plan]n (CM 89-93). By contrast, in Kermode's figurai reading, the "carnal presence" proposed by narrative dissolves back into the economy of the text to reveal itself as play. Its sense is nothing more than a function of the relation of writing to itself. In the Kermodean conception of the secrecy of the Gospel?of the secrecy of narrative?"all showing [monstration] is a means of hiding." Narrative has an infinite capacity for revealing its power to conceal ( CM 93-96). There is no point in hoping to choose between these two conceptions of narrative, or seeking to put an end to their dialogue. They reverse into one another, interminably. Narrative is both itself a mode of embodi ment, and a call to a future which will give it body in determining its truth. From an Augustinian perspective, to narrative as figurative reality, we may counterpose narrative as "a language conjuring its truth as a body to come [appelant le corps ? venir de sa v?rit?] or a figure that finds material proof in its fulfilment elsewhere [son remplissement ult?rieur]n (CM 98). In this respect, the prophetic mode is as significant for narrative as the representational mode. For prophetic narrative presents</page><page sequence="9">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 647 itself in relation to a future and the possibility of remplissement or fulfillment. In narrative the word returns from flesh to itself as language, in anticipation of "a body to come." By the same token, in narrative, writing finds a voice, but a voice that is ceaselessly traversed by writing and remains a parole muette. In the novel, above all, narrative does not secure the privileged status of the voice within the text, then, as stable source and guarantor of meaning, identity, truth, and humanity. It is rather "the ruin of every stable economy of fictional enunciation, its submission to the anarchy of writing" (PM 87). Taking Derrida and Ranci?re as my guides, then, my suggestion would be that the concept of narrative voice can neither be taken on trust nor simply dispensed with. If its status is metaphorical, the metaphor is not ipso facto easily reduced or smoothly superseded. The question may be, not how we get beyond the double-bind at issue here, but what kinds of significant thought are possible within it. A Derridean notion of the "spectral voice" and Ranci?re 's conception o? la parole muette serve partly as possible models for such thought. They may nonetheless seem to suggest the implausibility of any very decisive progress beyond contem porary problematizations of the concept of narrative voice (as in Towards a Postmodern Theory of Narrative). Furthermore, at a theoretical level, the question of narrative voice is currently being transformed by the proliferation of contemporary, technological forms of narrative. These appear to raise quite different theoretical questions to earlier forms. Take film, for instance: in fact, it would appear to indicate certain limits to my own case. Narrative voice in the cinema is audible. With the emergence of new technologies of art, is voice not restored to precisely the aesthetic status that, according to Ranci?re, it lost with romanticism? If ours is a "society of the spectacle" as never before, isn't it also a "society of the auditory" as no other has been? Isn't this currently reflected in a major theoretical reinvestment in voice, if of a very different kind to the one I've been concerned with so far?20 Paradoxically, in literary narrative, voice is properly material only in its written or textual dimension. Paradoxically again, insofar as narrative theory has been able to free the concept of voice from contamination by its other (writing), it has only been by a process of metaphorization or allegorization. In this process, what is called voice is always made more than just itself and combined with attributes that are not strictly proper to it (chiefly meaning and sense). However, film might seem to resist a deconstructive account of this kind. For in film, self-evidently, narrative voice has a properly material existence. I shall consider this question briefly in theoretical terms and with reference to three particular theorists, and then finish with an example.</page><page sequence="10">648 NEW LITERARY HISTORY It seems to me that narrative voice in film is not in fact as immune to a deconstructive logic as I have just suggested. But in the case of film, the logic in question needs be articulated differently. A "spectropoetics" of film is certainly possible. But what is at stake is not speech haunting writing, but writing haunting speech. In that respect, the paradigmatic instance for the theory of voice in film is that extraordinary example of narration by a dead writer, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard. First of all, of course, writing haunts the cinematic voice in quite a simple sense, in that the cinematic voice is commonly scripted.21 When the voice has not been scripted, it has at least been edited. From the start, voice in cinema?by which I always mean the voice we hear, whether narrator's or character's, and not any abstraction from it?is always subject to an order that is not its own. Its "spontaneity" or "human immediacy" is always subject to aesthetic, thematic, and, indeed, practical imperatives. Secondly, the cinematic voice is both human and mechanical or technological. In the cinema, the "spontaneity" of the voice as a "human production" has become an effect of technology. Thirdly, the material "pr?sence" of the voice in the cinema must therefore be considered in the complexity of its relation to its own iterability. Writing haunts the voice in the cinema insofar as the voice is "canned," but also in its uncanniness. It comes to an end, but can always be brought back to life. Paradoxically, then, the cinematic voice is always open to the possibility of re-presentation but never available in a condition of naive fullness. The repetition of the voice in cinema is thus possible insofar as the principle of the spectral inhabits or is inextricable from a material product. Voice in film is no more part of an immediate representation of a living world there before expression than writing is. Indeed, it is precisely in the cinema that the intimate relationship between the materiality of voice and its ghostliness?between voice and the principle of writing?may be most strikingly evident. In this respect, the peculiar status of the cinematic voice poses specific problems for both film theory and narrative theory. This is evident enough if we turn briefly to three major accounts specifically of narrative voice in film. The accounts in question are Sarah KozlofFs, David Bordwell's, and Michel Chion's. Of the three, it is KozlofFs argument that could best be described as "classic" (in terms of narrative theory, at least), in that it resorts to a geometries of the film text, but also, in a seeming contradiction, to a concept of the narrative voice in film as making for the "human fullness" I mentioned earlier. On the one hand, KozlofFs account of voice-over narration draws extensively on the tradition of narrative theory in literary studies (Booth, Scholes and Kellogg, Barthes, Stanzel, Chatman, Genette). Kozloff suggests that she is extending theory to "narrative as a transmedia phenomenon," which</page><page sequence="11">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 649 the literary theorists have promised but often failed to do (ISV2).22 She resorts to Genettian terminology and Genettian methods of classifica tion. Thus a familiar geometries of the text rapidly emerges along with a set of familiar, geometrical concepts: levels, "embedding," "Chinese boxes," frames, and so on. Kozloff also has the narratological fondness for geometrical diagrams. Yet, at the same time, she presents voice as "naturalizing" film narrative. In voice-over narration, she argues, "an odd, impersonal narrative agency is . . . humanized and tamed" (ISV 128). She sees this process as "a stripping away of an outer, technological shell to reveal the originating human labor, intelligence and creativity" (ISV 128). Thus narrator "Huw Morgan" is not the real author of How Green Was My Valley. But "as a human figure," he is closer to Darryl Zanuck and John Ford than is the technology of the cinema, "the camera, projector and reels of celluloid" (ISV 129). If it naturalizes cinematic narration, voice-over equally acknowledges the humanity of the spectator. It breaks down his or her position as Mulveyan voyeur, and makes the spectator's relationship to the film one of "connection and intimacy" (ISV 128-29). But the problems with KozlofFs account do not end with this contradiction. For, in fact, she finds it remarkably difficult to keep voice distinct from writing. One particularly revealing moment in her study comes when she argues that voice-over narration entered film at an early stage, with intertitles. D. W. Griffith used the latter, for example, "to suggest a personal tone of voice"; a tone that is perhaps too florid and preachy for modern tastes, adds Kozloff, "but consider how clearly we hear it" (ISV 24). Almost from the inception of cinema, then, writing is the voice. Kozloff cannot think the voice apart from sense and meaning. In effect, for her, sense and meaning always precede the voice. She repeatedly tends to conflate voice with "point of view," "attitude," and position. In this, however, she merely resembles a great deal of film theory and criticism. For a filmmaker to "find a voice" is also for him or her to make a statement. What lies behind the voice, then, is writing, what lies behind writing is sense, and what lies behind sense is its origin. Kozloff cites Metz: "The impression that someone is speaking is bound not to the empirical presence of a definite, known or knowable speaker but to the listener's spontaneous perception of the linguistic nature of the object to which he is listening: because it is speech, someone must be speaking" (ISV 44).23 For Kozloff, this "someone" is the "narrating agent" present in all films, the "master of ceremonies." Following Metz, she calls this agent "the grand image-maker" (ISV44). Voice is no more than one of a number of terms for this narrative master-presence. "Speaking" becomes virtually interchangeable with image-making. Since, on KozlofFs own admission, the "image-maker" is "a bodiless construction" (75^45),</page><page sequence="12">650 NEW LITERARY HISTORY this might seem perplexing. But we are very remote indeed from Metz's "empirical presence." For Kozloff, if, behind every film, we sense a narrating "voice," we sense it as a feature of a master of ceremonies who presents and controls the text (ISV1). In other words, we are solidly lodged in an established conception of narrative that is both humanistic and "theological" (in Derrida's sense). Here narrative is unthinkable apart from a center or "fixed point." In this respect, Kozloff seems hardly to hear the cinematic voice in its proper materiality at all. In Derrida's terms, she seeks to master the traces within the voice "of the Unheimliche or the uncanny so that it becomes simply the familiar." She therefore hears the voice only "in translation."24 David Bordwell's slightly earlier account of "narration in the fiction film" would appear to supply a very different perspective. Part at least of Bordwell's concern is to move the theory of cinematic narration beyond concepts of "enunciation." He sets out to resist a tradition of film theory and criticism that was much influenced by the work of Benveniste and saw the identification of enunciative strategies as "offering a method for detecting traces of subjectivity" in a film text.25 For Bordwell, such criticism repeatedly confused enunciation with optical and technological activity (camera work, editing, the shot, montage, and so forth). Film "lacks equivalents for the most basic aspects of verbal activity" (NFF 26). Bordwell resembles Kozloff, then, in virtually identifying voice or enunciation with sense. The material voice disappears in the interests of voice as metaphor (if one that is never quite made explicit, a point I shall return to in a moment). But what Bordwell himself offers, by contrast, is a peculiarly radical instance of the tendency in one strain of film theory to privilege the pictorial over the auditory. His conception of film narration identifies it primarily with vision rather than sound. Part of what Bordwell seems to want to escape from is the automatic presumption of what I have called the center or "fixed point," under stood as the point of enunciation. Thus "to give every film a narrator or implied author," he argues, "is to indulge in an anthropomorphic fiction" (NFF62). Narration "is better understood as the organization of cues for the construction of a story" (NFF 62). This presupposes a perceiver of a message, but not a sender. Part of Bordwell's strategy is to reverse the familiar narratological construction: it is the viewer who is now understood as "fixed point," and he or she who produces the geometry of the text. Indeed, one might argue that Bordwell seeks to produce a more effective version of the narratological articulation of the system of geometries with the "fixed point." In Bordwell's version of it, this articulation emerges in purer form as film is purged of the potentially troubling, unruly materiality of sound. In fact, Bordwell's</page><page sequence="13">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 651 book is arguably a radically idealist project, in that it insistently extracts and thereby rescues center, meaning, finality, even "absolute truth" (NFF 159) from the complex materiality of film. Yet what is remarkable is how far, in Bordwell's account of film, voice continually threatens to reestablish itself as metaphor and, with it, concepts of a controlling intelligence, the will to structure, style as personal signature; in fact the very anthropormorphism that Bordwell had sought to banish. It would seem as though, by virtue of its very radicality, Bordwell's idealist system is always likely to start leaking at the seams. He cannot help resorting to a terminology in which the meta phor of voice continues to remain implicit, even if it is never quite expressly articulated as such. Bordwell writes of films (October, for example) as "rhetorical arguments" (NFF82). Indeed, it is "as rhetoric," he claims, that narrative relates "to the perceiver" (NFF 58). In other words, it turns out that the "editorial intelligence" that, in a move that might appear to privilege the visual, Bordwell elsewhere identifies with narration (NFF 160) is also a form of enunciation after all. Again, Bordwell asserts that classical Hollywood narration requires the viewer to construct a "univocal" and art cinema an "equivocal" fabula (NFF165, 207). The metaphor of voice has scarcely been banished. It has rather been transmuted, to emerge in different terms. The "voice" of the fabula is no more the voice of Metz's "empirical presence" than narrative voice was for Kozloff. Nor is it an external voice (as it was for Kozloff), since it is produced by the viewer. But it is nonetheless voice as meaning, now understood, however, as "a voice which may remain entirely internal," as Derrida writes of the voice in Husserlian phenomenology (SP 33). Bordwell is in fact a prime instance of my earlier argument that the metaphor of voice is not readily "superseded," that it reasserts its continuing hold precisely within some of the most insistent efforts to dispense with it. The metaphor of voice haunts Bordwell's book like a specter, as writing haunts KozlofFs, in spite of the authors themselves. Michel Chion's book is the most original and adventurous of the three considered here, not least in that it pursues a theory of film principally in terms of sound and is chiefly concerned with the speaking voice. In effect, Chion decisively reverses the structure according to which Bordwell (classically) privileges image over sound. Chion argues that "the techni cal and aesthetic norms of the classic cinema were implicitly calculated to privilege the voice and the intelligibility of dialogue."26 Yet for all that film is often "vococentric," the cinematic voice is nonetheless "elusive," he says, a "strange object" for study (VC1). Chion seeks to capture this elusiveness or strangeness by concentrating on what he calls the "acousmatic" voice, which he takes as his paradigm: the voice whose source is not seen, a voice, therefore, that is "neither clearly inside nor clearly</page><page sequence="14">652 NEW LITERARY HISTORY outside" (VC 4). Chion's principal example of such a voice is Baum's voice as relayed through the microphone system in that film obsessed with bodiless voices and voiceless bodies, The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. In the fact of Baum's bodiless voice, we come upon a principal instance of what Chion calls the acousmetre, the talking shadow (VC 18-19). In its concentration on the acousmetre, however, Chion's book takes a curious turn. For he associates the acousmetre with extraordinary and even magical power. Its bodilessness lends it a "mythic aura," and its relation to the image is neither marginal nor spectral, but one of "possible inclusion" or possession (VC 100, 23). The acousmatic voice is troublingly immaterial. Indeed, its immateriality troubles film itself. Equally, the acousmatic voice declares that its realm?and that of the cinema?is other than that "of human being" ( VC23). But the acousmatic voice is also a ubiquitous, panoptical, omniscient, omnipotent voice, and?we might have guessed it?"the greatest acousmetre is God" ( VC 27). Chion thus pursues the significance of the acousmatic voice as paradigmatic of cinema as an art in which there is always a play of presence and absence. But he apparently needs to ground this powerful and unsettling case. He thus resorts to an almost obscurantist concep tion of the power of what lies offscreen. In the end, he cannot quite sustain or follow through his?in some ways compelling?apprehension of film's determining conditions. He misses the extent to which the bodiless voice might be paradigmatic for film precisely because voice in film itself is never other than bodiless. In fact, the acousmatic voice is arguably one of those features, distinctive to the medium, in which the cinema most intently reflects on its proper condition: that is, its own spectrality. After all, in The Testament of Dr. Mabuse, it is not clear that the voice of the acousmetre is simply Baum's and not that of Mabuse, whose ghostly figure we occasionally see entering Baum's body. More impor tantly, of course, at the climactic moment of the film, the voice, in fact, is shown to be sourceless, which is why Mabuse can be defeated (unlike God). Chion's book thus performs an extraordinary maneuver. As we have seen, in one way or another, neither Kozloff nor Bordwell is able to relinquish a conviction that the experience of the filmgoer is one of fullness. Film is replete with sense and meaning, an art of full presences. A given film will have a full, formal completeness. Most of all, quite simply, film is "fully human." Chion's book appears to constitute a decisive move beyond the humanism explicit in KozlofFs book and latent (or rather, perhaps, irrepressible) in Bordwell's. Chion recognizes the extent to which film may rather be thought in terms of radical lack. But in the trope of the ma?trise of the acousmetre, he also recreates film</page><page sequence="15">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 653 according to a theological structure. This structure effectively privileges voice as hypnotic, controlling presence, as constituting the very essence of an art in the fullness of its power. Chion's acousmetre is very much closer to KozlofFs master of ceremonies than to what, following Ranci?re, I earlier called the voice of an "impossible body." Like Kozloff and Bordwell, but less obviously, Chion is reluctant to imagine ?i?tfortornness might be a distinctive feature of film. The theological premise is there to neutralize a melancholic reognition of how far film makes the material spectral. Not surprisingly, while Chion includes a section on "the speaking dead," it lasts for little more than a page (VC 46-47). Sunset Boulevard is mentioned only briefly. Yet it is Wilder's film rather than Fritz Lang's Testament that seems to me to be paradigmatic for the cinema. Sunset Boulevard is a film about ghosts: burdened by debt and a faltering career as a Hollywood screenwriter, Jim Gillis (William Holden) stumbles upon the decaying mansion of silent film star Nora Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Desmond's career, of course, has been cut short by the advent of sound. She lives all alonej save for her first husband, Max (Erich von Stroheim), who has weirdly transformed himself into her butler, sedulously pandering to her whims and sustaining her belief in her own continuing popularity. Gillis seeks to turn the situation to his advantage, indulging Desmond's fantasies of a long-awaited comeback by revising her preposterous script for a film of Salome. But the relationship subtly shifts: Desmond moves Gillis into the house and begins to dominate both him and his life, casting him in the role of young lover. Desmond's project is turned down by Paramount and Cecil B. de Mille. Gillis seeks to assert his freedom by leaving her for a younger woman, with whom he has fallen in love. Unable to face either rejection, Desmond shoots him dead. Sunset Boulevard frequently resorts to the metaphor of ghostliness: Gillis contemplating the nocturnal image of "the ghost of a tennis court," for instance, at Desmond's house. The film's cinematography also works to confer a spectral character on some of what we see, most notably, perhaps, when, having been lured downstairs into police custody in the belief that she is being feted again as the star she truly is, Desmond moves towards the camera for her final close-up, and the image begins to blur and fade. More importantly, the film itself is about a world grown ghostly, or one whose ghostliness has been abruptly made apparent: the world of silent film, which, as we are made peculiarly aware when Desmond shows Gillis one of her old films, with the advent of sound, became ghostly twice over. Sunset Boulevard insistently conjures the ghosts of silent film: Fairbanks, Gilbert, Griffith, Normand, and Valentino (all referred to); Von Stroheim (who stars in it, and whose</page><page sequence="16">654 NEW LITERARY HISTORY career as director virtually ended with sound) ; Chaplin (whom Desmond impersonates) and Sennett (whom she recalls in falling into one of the routines of Sennett's "Bathing Beauties"); even Swanson herself, whose career was very similar to Desmond's; and, above all, Keaton, who makes a cameo appearance, "ghosting" himself, complete with characteristic flick of the head and melancholy moue, as a phantom the sound of whose voice?in Wilder's film, we actually hear Keaton?is precisely a token of his cinematic "death." More poignantly still, there are the cameo roles for obscure ghosts from the days of silent cinema who remain nameless until the credits (Hedda Hopper, Anna Q. Nilsson, Ray Evans, Jay Livingston); and the names of forgotten ghosts: Rod LaRocque, for instance, and his wife Vilma Banky, the sound of whose voice, with its Hungarian accent, was precisely what "killed" her, putting an end to her life on screen. But Sunset Boulevard does not subscribe to any myth which might simply counterpose the "dead" world of the silents to the "living" world of die talkies and sound. For the ghostliness of the silent world haunts this talkie throughout, and it does so, precisely, through a voice. In Sunset Boulevard, the dominant voice (the narrator's) is indeed that of a ghost, since the story is told by Gillis after his death. This is a voice the production of which is self-evidently dependent on technology on the one hand and writing on the other, the second being indirectly empha sized by the fact that Gillis is himself a screenwriter. In other words, Wilder writes what the advent of sound had decreed was the condition of the silent film into the talkie. The voice was the very feature which had seemed to endow the sound film with a revolutionary new power of bringing art closer to life. But Sunset Boulevard hollows it out, riddles it with the sense of historicity that had dawned on cinema with the eclipse of the silent film. In that respect, Wilder comes close to satirizing that desperate, modern desire?often supreme in technological cultures?to close the very gap (between art and life) on which art feeds. Voice has the status of a bodiless, automatic sound, like "the wind" that Gillis notices "wheezing through" the organ in Desmond's house "once in a while." To put the point differently: Sunset Boulevard understands its own obsolescence in the image of the cinema it succeeds (the silent cinema). As a film full of love for the cinema as an art and distaste for it as an industry, it may even seem to anticipate the possibility of a "culture to come"?to adapt a term of Ranci?re's that I used earlier?that, in Gillis's world-weary phrase, will "wrap up the whole Hollywood deal." But perhaps the most significant moment in the film comes when Desmond visits de Mille at Paramount Studios. As she sits in de Mille's chair, a microphone swings up from behind her and brushes her headwear. Crossly, she pushes it away. She has of course been disturbed</page><page sequence="17">VOICE, NARRATIVE, FILM 655 by the very technological instrument that has spelt her demise. But it is also the instrument which allows Sunset Boulevard itself to be narrated, which makes possible the fiction that Gillis can speak. The microsequence offers a momentary but pointed reminder of film as technological mediation of the body, as mediated trace of flesh. Desmond's irrita tion?the desire to exclude the evidence of technological intervention, to push it out of frame?is classic, and a figure for the viewer's own will to forget. It might also be a figure for the kind of theoretical amnesia with which much of this essay has been concerned. My argument throughout this essay has been that, in the case specifically of voice, in film as in literary studies though above all in the latter, even when it has turned voice into a metaphor, theory has sought to minimize the distance between narrative and world. It has seldom problematized the relationship between the technological representation or reproduction of voice in narrative and what Fludernik calls "embodied" voice, frequently assuming that the one can be practically identified with the other. My insistence would be to the contrary: if the answer to Barthes's question as to who speaks in a literary text is no one, then it is also the case that the voice is heard in the cinema only in composition with what is not itself. There is finally no such thing as either narrative or cinematic voice, if with voice we associate a vital, spontaneous, unpre dictable, and properly human event. Whether it be "heard" in a written or printed text or as part of a soundtrack, what the humanities most commonly call voice has already become part of a technology and a system of communication or representation. As Derrida suggests in a discussion of "Writing and Telecommunication," it should not be assumed that the "space" of that system is self-identical or homogeneous either with other such spaces or with "the field and powers" of speech.27 Accordingly, I have argued for a rather different kind of thought about voice in narrative from that which has long been predominant in narrative theory. The condition of both literary and cinematic narrative is never human fullness but (in different ways) what Ranci?re calls a "quasi-corporeality [quasi-corpor?it?]" (CM 111). The question I have tried to raise here is how theory might best begin to adapt itself to a recognition of that condition, of the irreducibly ambivalent status of narrative voice, of what, much earlier, in Derridean terms, I referred to as the ineradicable play of diff?rance within it. Finally, as I've said, there is also a politics at issue: a politics of the condition of narrative as one of division and self-difference, even of anticipation, of the word precisely not made flesh.
