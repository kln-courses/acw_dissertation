<plain_text><page sequence="1">FAMILIAR AND FOREIGN BODIES: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF THE HUMAN-TECHNOLOGY INTERFACE MICHAEL JACKSON University of Copenhagen This article examines some of the ways in which our experiences of, and interactions with, new technologies are grounded in the strategies and metaphors of reciprocity that govern everyday social life.Though I follow others in arguing that technology and society cannot be separated, I explore this interrelationship intersubjectively, looking first at some of the ways in which people relate to computers, then analysing the experiences of trans- plant recipients. I summarize my findings as a critique of the view that anthropomor- phism is a quintessentially pre-modern phenomenon, and as a challenge to the idea that innovations in gene technology and cyber-technology presage a universal and inevitable dissolution of the boundaries between nature and culture, humans and machines. Most current debates about new technologies attempt to decide whether the innovations are good or bad, or how they may be regulated. The discourse is thus either ethical or governmental. But in focusing on how the effects of new technologies may be evaluated and managed, these debates often leave unexplored the more immediately empirical issue of how we actually expe- rience and interact with technologies, and how our attitudes towards them are linked to perennial human anxieties about the strange, the new, and the other. My thesis in this article is an existential one. I take it as axiomatic that all human beings need to have a hand in choosing their lives, and to be rec- ognized as having an active part to play in the shaping of their social worlds. As a corollary, I approach the meaning of what people say and do in terms of the degree to which they accomplish a balance between controlling their own fate, collective or otherwise, and accepting that which cannot be decided by human will or subjected to human designs. To define meanings without reference to this intersubjective dynamic is, in my view, practically meaning- less. Thus, an anthropology of'human-machine interaction' is unedifying while it insists that human intersubjectivity is reducible to cognitive schemata and communicative 'rationality' (e.g. Suchman 1987: 1). Over the last twenty years, several scholars have demonstrated that tech- nology and society are intimately interconnected. Inspired by Heidegger's famous 1954 lecture on technology, Ihde's seminal Technics and praxis (1979) argued that '[h]uman-machine relations are existential relations in which our fate and destiny are implicated, but which are subject to the very ambiguity ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2002. J. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 8, 333-346</page><page sequence="2">MICHAEL JACKSON found in all existential relations' (1979: 4). Although Ihde sees these existen- tial relations as rooted in the life world, he does not, however, explore the specifically social character of these relations. In anthropology, Tim Ingold echoes Ihde's repudiation of the split between technology and society, arguing that 'technical relations are embedded in social relations, and can only be understood within this relational matrix, as one aspect of human sociality' (1997: 107), though he says little about how this embeddedness is experi- enced, while Pierre Lemonnier's work on the 'social representation' of tech- nologies tends to reduce the experience of technology to cognitive, formal, and informational models (1992: 79-85). Bryan Pfaffenberger makes a pow- erful case against the 'standard view' of technology - as a body of techniques and material objects that answer human needs yet remain separate from our- selves - by describing the intimate and complex interactions that bind tech- nology, human labour, and social relationships into a 'sociotechnical system' (1988b; 1992). Recently, Gary Lee Downey has explored the blurred bound- aries between technology and society by focusing on how such boundaries are variously 'drawn and lived in everyday experiences' (1998: 27).And anthro- pological studies of'biographical objects' and 'the social life of things' - all of which trace their genealogy to Marx's insights into the experience of labour (Marx 1964: 89-91; Marx &amp; Engels 1976: 43) - have made us more acutely aware of the complex ways in which objects become personalized and persons become objectified in the course of social life (Appadurai 1986; Hopkins 1998; Hornborg 2001; Miller 1991). In this article I pick up the existential-phenomenological threads in this body of work, and seek to demonstrate how this perspective may be more systematically explored. Methodologically, this entails bracketing out, or setting aside, questions concerning the large-scale social impact of new technologies in order to explore the intersubjective dynamics of the human encounter with technology. Technology and intersubjectivity In his 1954 lecture on technology, Heidegger noted that technology (tekhne) should not be confused with techniques, and so reduced to mere instru- mentality. Technology is an aspect of our human existence; indeed, it brings forth and makes apparent the very essence of our Being (Heidegger 1977: 294-5). For anthropologists, being is quintessentially social. We are social before we are anything else. As Merleau-Ponty observes,'The social is already there when we come to know or judge it ... it exists obscurely and as a summons' (1962: 362). What is it, then, that technology reveals to us about this field of social being? I begin by noting that the social is lived as a network of reciprocal rela- tionships among subjects, that is to say, intersubjectively. This implies, first, that human beings everywhere tend to conceive of subjectivity not only as encom- passing others but as extending into the extra-human world, with the result 334</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL JACKSON that objects, words, and ideas tend to become imbued with consciousness and will (Jackson 1998: 9). Though this tendency to act as if the object world were obedient to the ground rules of interpersonal life helps us to cope with what George Devereux calls 'the trauma of the unresponsiveness of matter'(1967: 32-4), it remains largely illusory and variable.1 As with alien others, the world of the extra-human contradicts our anthropomorphic assumptions and proves refractory to our intersubjective strategies of con- structive engagement and control. It may be comforting to believe that we can negotiate reciprocal agreements with enemies, appease the unruly ele- ments with sacrificial gifts, or strike bargains with the gods, but in reality the extra-human world impacts upon us in unpredictable and ungovernable ways. This brings me to a second point about intersubjective relations. They are characterized by struggle. To some extent we may see this as a struggle against alienation, though alienation understood as more than just the estrangement of a worker from his or her production. Thus, although Marx's main focus was on how a person loses himself in the object on which he labours, an object which then'confronts him as something hostile and alien' (Marx 1961: 70), he also noted that a person may lose himself in alienating relationships with others - including the gods. 'The estrangement of man, and in fact every relationship in which man stands to himself, is first realised and expressed in the relationship in which a man stands to other men' (Marx 1961: 78). Inter- subjective struggle also bears some resemblance to the Darwin-Wallace strug- gle for survival, though it is important to point out that the struggle for Being cannot be reduced to the satisfaction of physical needs or the perpetuation of one's own species-being, for the scarce goods we compete for, or lay claim to, or exchange, on the grounds that they are essential for our existence, are elusive, indeterminate, and unstable qualities. This means that intersubjective relations are steeped in ambiguity. Though our very existence may be felt to depend upon the possession of such things as health, wealth, power, position, prestige, recognition, knowledge, dignity, happiness, and love, accessing and controlling such 'symbolic goods' is diffi- cult to achieve and almost impossible to fix.We are thus susceptible to feeling that Being itself is something that must be constantly struggled for. That is to say that in all human relationships the other is potentially a source of fulfil- ment and of frustration, of being and non-Being. And this ambiguity inheres in our relations with both human and extra-human others, since in various contexts persons, animals, gods, spirits, material things, and technologies all hold the potential to sustain our lives or end them. Psychoanalysis traces this ambiguity back to the period of primary inter- subjectivity when an infant's dependence on the mother entails both affir- mation and negation. As Devereux puts it, 'The prototype of all panic caused by a lack of response is the reaction of the infant to the absence, or tempo- rary unresponsiveness, of its mother' (1967: 32). Although we should be careful not to reduce all forms of sociality to the mother-infant bond, it is generally the case that human beings have great difficulty in coming to terms with the fact that others are seldom straightforward extensions of themselves, and that distant others are not governed by the same ground rules that govern inter- action with those we like to call our own. It is in this unstable relationship 335</page><page sequence="4">MICHAEL JACKSON between self and other - and by extension, between human and extra-human worlds - that our ambivalent attitudes to technology arise. Rather like the body in Cartesian thought, technologies are sometimes seen as extensions of ourselves - and as such, subject to our will. But at other times they are felt to be alien, invasive forms of non-Being that subjugate us, undermining our very notion of who and what we are. Nowadays it is often argued that devel- opments in cyber-technology and gene technology have all but abolished the boundary between nature and culture, automaton and autonomy, humans and things. And it is already a cliche that information technology has brought all humanity together in a single global village. Such views, however, do not reflect universal experience. Confidently objectivist in tone (e.g. Gray 1995), these arguments seldom take into account the numerous contexts in which doubt, anxiety, or powerlessness tend to make people dread such erasures of the line between themselves and others, or themselves and machines. In this respect the discourse on technology and the discourse on migrants and mar- ginalized others run together, for both raise critical questions concerning not only our capacity to conceptualize the supposedly extra-human as human but our ability actually to incorporate and control it. The hypotheses I want to explore in the following pages are, first, that our human ambivalence towards new technologies must be understood against the background of our ambivalence towards others, and secondly, that the ways in which we experience our relationships with both persons and machines will depend upon the degree to which we feel in control of these relation- ships, as well as the degree to which these relationship are felt to augment rather than diminish our own sense of well-being. Encountering new technologies My 9-year-old son, Joshua, is playing a 'hard version' of a game on his Gameboy. The game is not going well for him. He flings down the machine, and walks away, tears of frustration in his eyes. 'It's not fair!', he exclaims. 'What's not fair?', I ask. 'It isn't fair. If you miss just one thing the game ends. It should give you another chance to get something. But it keeps on making me lose.' It is not uncommon to hear people speak of their relations with machines in much the same way as they speak of their relations with other people. When the relationship 'works', differences between self and other are experienced as complementary rather than antagonistic: everything is under control, reciprocity is balanced, self and other seem to be as one. But when the machine does not conform to human expectations of reciprocity or fair play, we get distressed and angry, much as we would if a person behaved unfairly towards us or failed to acknowledge a gift. Consider, for example, human relations with computers. In his ethnographic fieldwork in a computer lab (1998), Downey observed numerous instances of 'boundary blurring activities'. When he asked students directly if they 'ever felt themselves merged with the machine'(1998: 147), most responded defen- sively; they did not want to appear as 'geeks' who were more comfortable with machines than persons, and did not want to seem irrational or animistic - though one student admitted,'I'd probably say that I'm one with the com- 336</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL JACKSON puter' (1998: 148). However, despite the students' reluctance to admit to any kinship with a machine, Downey's empirical observations led him to conclude that their experience of the boundary between themselves and their machines was continually shifting along a continuum: at times the students experienced agency as if it were located within them, sometimes as if it were located within the machine, sometimes somewhere in between (1998: 238).2 Although from an objective point of view a person and a machine are man- ifestly different entities, an experiential point of view reveals the extent to which our sense of being either essentially different from or symbiotically merged with a machine is a function of how we interact with it - specifically, how much we feel we understand it and how much control we feel we have over it. When this knowledge/control is lost, as Downey observed, people often feel vulnerable, frustrated, and angry, as if the machine has somehow invaded them or taken something from them (1998: 185-92). Let us consider in more detail the kinds of things that happen when our relationships with machines 'don't work', or'break down'.3 Some of the most sophisticated innovations in contemporary medical tech- nology have been in the field of radiology. But new imaging technologies such as CT scanners pose problems of adaptation and understanding for radi- ologists, and problems of organization for the departments in which they work. In a study of four community hospitals in Massachusetts, Stephen Barley observed several strategies used by staff to deal with the anxieties and diffi- culties which they experienced with the new technology. Some of these were 'ritual' strategies that created the impression that there was no problem, such as rebooting or downloading the computer when problems arose, and so making the problem 'disappear'. Others involved attributing technical prob- lems to mechanical failures, as if recourse to the language of the old tech- nology could alleviate one's anxieties in dealing with the new. Still others were 'magical' in character, and involved addressing the computer as if it were a person. Barley's comments on this anthropomorphism are worth quoting at length: As used by the techs, 'THE COMPUTER' implied a mysterious force which, if not malevolent, was surely fickle. ... THE COMPUTER was said to be capricious; it had, in the techs' own words,'a mind of its own.' THE COMPUTER was a sentient entity that 'liked' or 'did not like' commands, that acted 'crazy,' and that beeped when it wanted to say,'I'm hot.' In the throes of a persistent problem, technologists beseeched THE COMPUTER to do as they desired, and the bold among them even insulted THE COMPUTER with word and gesture. Most important, however, when events went irretrievably wrong, it was THE COM- PUTER that was said to have caused the problem. Although THE COMPUTER always lurked in the background, the techs usually kept it at bay with their mechanical metaphors, their confirmatory strategy of problem solving, and the ritual solutions and superstitions that the confirmatory strategy engendered. It was only when these practical tools failed that techs resorted to anthropomorphic talk. To say THE COMPUTER was a cause was, in effect, to admit that one didn't know what was wrong (Barley 1988: 520) Two insights are provided here into what I shall call the intersubjective imaginary. First, the computer is addressed not as if it were an alien object, but as something with which a reciprocal, symbiotic relationship is possible. As a corollary of this, the technicians' failures to understand or control the 337</page><page sequence="6">MICHAEL JACKSON computer led them to behave towards it as they would behave towards a per- verse or obdurate person - either ignoring it, or trying to force it into a more responsive relationship with them. However, it is generally when relationships with a machine (or person) suffer 'irreparable damage' that people begin to construct the other in terms of radical otherness - as an enemy, an alien, a threat. In this sense, the 'breakdown' of relations with a machine, or within a marriage, or between two nations, tends to entail similar compensatory strate- gies and counter-strategies whereby individuals seek to recover their own lost or compromised Being. Sartre's phenomenology of the emotions (1948) offers useful insights into these compensatory strategies, though I share Pfaffenberger's view that we would do well to bracket out questions as to whether'a given activity "works" [i.e. is "technical"] or "doesn't work" [i.e. is "magico-religious"]' (1992: 501). Sartre's argument centres on the strong emotions that are stirred in us when we feel that machines have ceased to do our bidding, or have started to behave incomprehensibly. This emotionality may be considered in two ways. First, strong emotions arise spontaneously when we are frustrated in our attempts to comprehend and control others or objects. But secondly, and most impor- tantly, we work on and play up these emotions, making them the means whereby we 'magically' recover our sense of lost power over others or objects. Nursing ill-will towards an enemy, cursing an errant computer, kicking a flat tyre, or pitying oneself for one's inability to stand up to a tyrant will not nec- essarily effect any change in the behaviour of the object or other, but may reverse one's experience of one's relationship with it. One becomes, imagina- tively and retrospectively, the determining subject of the events that reduced one to the status of an object. Clearly, when we are blocked from acting, emotionality is only one strat- egy for recovering our existential footing. We also focus on words and thoughts, and on our own bodies. Thus, in cursing a machine we cannot understand or manipulate, or in recounting a story about some humiliating event, or in inflicting injuries upon our own bodyself, we displace the role of the other and recapture a sense of our own subjectivity - of ourselves as actors rather than acted upon, as authors of meaning rather than victims of circumstance. The problem is that this process involves splitting self from other - a split that may become entrenched and habitual, as in Luddite views of technology, chauvinist views of asylum-seekers, and racist views of foreign bodies. In turning now to the field of allotransplantion, I want to probe more deeply the existential conditions and the limits under which human beings can encompass radical otherness. Between self and other: a phenomenology of allotransplantation Though allotransplants are often spoken of as 'gifts of life', these gifts are ambiguous. This is not simply because a death is the precondition for the bestowal of this gift. It is because the giving of the gift is not grounded in any immediate social relationship between recipient and donor. As such the gift is asocial, and resembles an alienated object, a commodity. This otherness of the 338</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL JACKSON donated organ creates feelings of deep ambivalence, disorientation, and anxiety in recipients. "'Sometimes I feel born again,"' noted one individual.'"Some- times I am very depressed"' (in Forsberg, Backman &amp; M6ller 2000: 331). This emotional confusion often precipitates an identity crisis:'"Who am I? Where do I come from? I was completely dizzy. It was like the familiar me but the safety I had felt was no longer there. Instead there was a new person"' (Forsberg, Backman &amp; M6ller 2000: 331). These crises reflect not simply the 'foreign-ness' of the organ, but the anomalous relationship of recipient and donor - the incorporation into the bodyself of a vital organ that belonged to a com- plete stranger, that is, so to speak, quintessentially not-self. This problem is undoubtedly exacerbated in cases of xenotransplantation, when the organ is from an animal, and in xenophobic societies, where there may be strong resis- tance to receiving organs from foreign,'soul-less' sources (Papagaroufali 1996: 251).Yet in every case, the struggle to incorporate or assimilate that which is construed as 'other' is directly comparable to the struggle that, for example, characterizes the incorporation of in-marrying wives in societies with patrilo- cal residence, or the accommodation of immigrants, refugees, and outsiders in countries of asylum. What kind of reciprocity will exist between us and them? Before detailing some of the intersubjective strategies that are typically used to imagine or negotiate some kind of identification with the 'other', let us look at a case of transplantation where this struggle between familiar and foreign was absent, for it helps us see the extent to which the trauma of trans- plantation is a function of the experiential distance that exists between recip- ient and donor. Valerie and Andrew Milne first met in 1993 through a lonely-hearts column and married two years later. In March 1999, Andrew, 46, was diagnosed with an acute kidney infection. Valerie, 40, proved to be a perfect donor match, and the transplantation took place a year later. Andrew comments: The transplant made us feel more at one than we were before. We were pretty close then, but we have an extra-special relationship now. I've got a part of her inside me now. It's strange,Valerie is a chocoholic. Before the operation, I never ate chocolate, but after- wards, I craved it. It seemed her kidney had transferred her addiction to me (The Inde- pendent, 23 Apr. 2001: 18). What is compelling here is the image of union - of one incorporated in another, as in a love-match or marriage.Valerie comments: When I found out that I had the same blood type as Andy, I had an overpowering feeling that I wanted to donate him one of my kidneys. It was the same type of feeling I had when I first met him and I knew we were meant to be together (The Independent, 23 Apr. 2001: 18). This sense of intersubjective fusion - variously expressed in images of entwined destinies, spiritual affinity, marriage, friendship, or kinship - is not uncommon in cases of organ donation, but in almost every case it has to be contrived and created. Not surprisingly, it is the logic of balanced reciprocity that governs the creation of this intersubjective imaginary. Sometimes this 339</page><page sequence="8">MICHAEL JACKSON takes the form of donors demanding reciprocity for the gift of life by seeking to establish 'long-term social relationships with recipients' (Sharp 1995: 365), or of transplant recipients trying to establish a social relationship with the donor's surviving kin. Sometimes an intersubjective relationship between self and donor will be cultivated symbolically. In the cases of Lena, for whom 'all living things are part of a flow, a system of constant give and take', it was easy to be reconciled to receiving the organ of a 'stranger' (Lundin 1999: 22-4); likewise for Sylvia, who argued that 'there are invisible links between people' that are reinforced by the ability of donor cells to remember their origins (Lundin 1999: 18). For individuals who see the world as more deeply divided into mutually incompatible domains (animals/humans, humans/machines), the work of reconciliation is more arduous. Some individuals are fearful that they will incorporate unwanted traits of the donor's personality, while others anx- iously seek assurances that the organ is clinically sterile - cleansed of its asso- ciation with the symbolically 'dirty' world of not-self (Lundin 1999: 12). Often recipients personalize the organ they have received. In one case, the recipient baptized the liver she had received, and gave it a name.'"In the beginning it was something unfamiliar which was left to me to take care, I walked around holding it like when I was pregnant. I was surrounding the liver with my hands the way you hold your stomach during pregnancy. As time went on it was more like a gift which ought to be treasured"' (in Forsberg, Backman &amp; Moller 2000: 332-3). Typically, too, recipients feel concern, regret, sorrow, and guilt that someone should die in order for them to live (Forsberg, Backman &amp; Moller 2000: 330; Sharp 1995: 380;Weems &amp; Patterson 1989: 30), as if they had received a gift at another person's expense. To redress this imagined imbal- ance and reciprocate the gift of life, patients often conjure strong emotions of gratitude towards the donor, and the same compelling logic of reciprocity often gives rise to the kind of binding relationship, physical identification, and indebtedness between recipient and donor that we associate with balanced reciprocity and direct exchange. But because the gift cannot be fully recipro- cated, there is often an emotional contradiction between the assumption of affinity and the practical problem of reciprocating the gift. Fox and Swazey speak of this as 'the tyranny of the gift' (cited in Sharp 1995: 365). At the same time, because official medical discourse dismisses anthropomorphism as irrational, these stratagems of the imaginary are often at odds with the objec- tivist, commoditizing, depersonalized language preferred by surgeons and other transplant professionals (Sharp 1995: 378-82). In sum, it is difficult for human beings to entertation or tolerate an inti- mate, intercorporeal relationship with the world they think of as not-self.Yet when one's life depends on entering into such a relationship and receiving the gift of life from someone who is radically other, people have recourse to the strategies of reciprocity in order to make the relationship viable. Anthropomorphism The implicit argument of this article has been to see the classic antinomies of reason and emotion, body and mind, self and other, nature and culture, subject and object not as competing ontologies, but as terms we deploy, var- 340</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL JACKSON iously and often interchangeably, to capture different modalities or moments of intersubjective experience - the sense that we are at times actors, in control of our situations, and at other times at the mercy of circumstances, and acted upon. In exploring how identity terms such as 'self' and 'other' are largely determined by the ways in which we interact with one another, I have sug- gested that the ways in which we think, act, and reason are grounded in the forms and experiences of sociality - specifically of reciprocity - and that these are universal. Yet we still persist in seeing some societies as collectively governed by anthropomorphism, and others by scientific rationality - or some by the logic of gifts, and others by the commodified logic of the market-place. It is the same kind of division that led to the classic anthropological division between hi-tech and low-tech societies. In Kroeber's seminal 1917 essay on 'The superorganic', culture is ethereal- ized; it is not only 'extrasomatic' but excludes material culture and most of what we would classify as technology (Jackson 1989: 121; Pfaffenberger 1992). This idealist split between culture and technology is central to Plato, and implicates other discursive divisions between theory and practice, and mind and body (Ihde 1979: xix-xxiv). And this bias against technology, embodi- ment, and practice in philosophy presages the same bias in anthropology. In both cases, the world is divided into a world of subjects and a world of objects (the body often being assimilated, along Cartesian lines, to the object world as mere instrumentality, as res extensa). Phenomenologically, however, subject and object are not stable entities but simply words we give to two extreme modalities of human interaction - being actor and being acted upon, being a 'who' and being a 'what'. To speak of intersubjectivity is to recognize that objects appear sometimes to be animated by human consciousness and will, and human subjects appear sometimes to be like objects, treated as if they were mere things. It is also to abandon attempts to draw a hard-and-fast onto- logical distinction between subjective and objective domains, for experience is continually oscillating between quite various senses of self and other depending on the context and character of the interaction. Historically, the subject-object split, like the body-mind dichotomy, may be understood as a discursive strategy for drawing a line between ourselves and animals, and ourselves and things. Once this split is made, it is all too easy to associate anthropomorphic or animistic thinking with primitives, children, or the insane, and to make reason definitive of one's own privileged preserve. Empirically, however, this distinction is neither substantial nor stable. It is not even that we project human consciousness and will onto machines, or try to imagine machines as persons, for intersubjectivity so shapes our experience from early infancy that it constitutes a'natural attitude' towards the world into which we find ourselves thrown - a world that includes persons, machines, words, ideas, and other creatures. It is thus no mystery that human beings should speculate over whether computers 'think', or ask whether machines will 'save' us or pose a 'menace' to our existence; the questions are grounded in the habits of sociality well before they find expression in ethical or gov- ernmental debates, and reflect the ambiguity of all intersubjective life - the question as to whether the other, with whom I have yet formed no primary bond, is with or against me, friend or foe. 341</page><page sequence="10">MICHAEL JACKSON But my principal concern is neither the history of ideas nor epistemology, but the pragmatics of coping in everyday life. In trauma, the splits alluded to above between body and mind, and person and machine, figure among the strategies people use when trying to make good an existential loss, or regain a sense of comprehension and control. As a general principle, people tend to turn from or flee the source of their distress and take refuge in some surro- gate object that they feel more comfortable with, that they feel they 'know' and can 'manage'. If body is imagined to be split from mind, then body is made an object on which subjectivity can go to work, but from a safe dis- tance as it were. '"You feel betrayed," said one individual after liver trans- plantation. "You can't trust your own body. In spite of all it hasn't become part of me"' (cited in Forsberg, Backman &amp; Moller 2000: 332). In her research among infertile couples, Tine Tjornhoj-Thomsen also observed that infertil- ity can make a person feel guilty about, or betrayed by, her body, though this loss of control over the 'object body' is made good by various imaginative strategies of displacement and blaming. Thus one woman reasoned, "Maybe it is because I led a wild life in my young days; maybe my infertility is caused by some drugs my mother took during pregnancy."' Said another:'"It is good to know that it is not me, but something chemical in my body"' (Tjornhoj- Thomsen forthcoming). A similar process of splitting separates words from world, enabling one to make use of language - particularly in the form of story-telling - as a way of obliquely and surreptiously regaining a sense of mastery over events one has suffered passively or in silence. And in the face of anxieties provoked by new gene technologies, many people seek to reinscribe the blurred bound- aries between nature and culture or the human and the divine, in the belief that if nature and the divine are separate domains they may become places of refuge. The same principle may apply to the splitting of machines and men. But as the poignant case of Joey -'a mechanical boy' - reported by Bruno Bettelheim (1959), shows, some people may find refuge in machines where others find refuge in the world of other human beings. Unloved and rejected by his parents and starved of all human contact, Joey repudiated the human world altogether and came to imagine himself as a machine - ruled by mechanical routines and needs, and bereft of feeling. Though Joey was stuck with his belief, such fantasies are typical of the ways in which human beings cathect onto things that give them security when other objects of their will, affection, or desire thwart and negate them. Within the field of intersubjectivity, then, the object of our focus is con- tinually shifting.What governs these shifts is the degree to which we feel exis- tentially fulfilled. When a person experiences a radical diminution of his or her Being in relation to another person or an object, he or she will seek to compensate for this loss by focusing on or identifying with a person or object where he or she feels recognized, complemented, or affirmed. Thus, in his study of software hackers and 'phone phreakers', Pfaffenberger notes that many of these marginalized individuals were seeking recognition, approval, prestige, and a greater sense of self-worth from a 'central authority' in much the same way as a neglected child might seek to capture the attention and love of a negligent parent by misbehaving in a clever and audacious way, regaining 'entry to a world that has denied them' (1988a: 44). 342</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL JACKSON The problem with these compensatory strategies is that they are Manichean. That is to say that by affirming one object, one other, or one world, the anti- thetical pole becomes an essentialized and scapegoated symbol of absolute negativity. Thus men, anxious about their control of the social world, conjure the image of the witch as the embodiment of chaos. Or nationalists engage in xenophobic rhetoric, and conjure images of the minatory other, in order to bolster their sense of self-worth. Or Luddites destroy all technology in their desperation to restore their sense of being in step with history. Can we avoid these Manichean excesses? To what extent can we live with boundary blurring? Critique of the nature-culture opposition Several recent writers have observed that the new gene technologies render the opposition between nature and culture obsolete. Because we can now manipulate genetic processes, the boundary between natural selection and cul- tural selection is blurred, and 'the 'natural' and the 'social' are no longer to be seen as ontologically different (Haraway 1991; Rheinberger 2000: 19). Paul Rabinow calls this hybridized condition 'biosociality', for nature becomes 'modelled on culture understood as practice' with the consequences that 'culture becomes natural' and nature becomes 'artificial' (1996: 99). There are three problems with this sort of pronouncement. The first is ethnographic. Although technologies such as xenotransplantation (gene transfers between humans and animals) and transgenesis (humans receiving human organs) are new, there is abundant evidence that ritual and intellectual techniques for crossing the boundaries between animal and human domains (shape-shifting, totemism), or between nature and culture (fetishism, anthropomorphism), occur in all societies and at all times. Indeed, 'primitives' possibly have no more or less investment in the separation of nature and culture than 'we' do. The second point is political. If indigenous people insist on the strict separa- tion of the human sphere, on the one hand, and the sphere of divine or natural life, on the other, it is often not primarily a statement of belief (cognitive commitment) but a strategic defence of local interests and rights against new technologies over which they feel they have little control or comprehension. Thus, in a submission to the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, the Maori Congress declared that 'the Maori genome is a cultural resource' and that 'Maori have the right to control their resources as their own ... according to specific cultural preferences'. But the political agenda behind this assertion is revealed in the ensuing clause:'Most of the previous 160 years has been characterized by Pakeha indifference to Maori cultural and spiritual values associated so intimately with their lands and their natural biodiversity' (Maori Council Submission 2001, Form 1, p. 1).4 My third criticism is phenomenological, and brings me back to my central argument - that lived reality cannot be reliably inferred from the way reality is discursively contructed and cognitively represented. Although we may ontol- ogize, essentialize, reify, or actively deny the symbolic contrast between culture and nature, or self and other, it is important to see these contrasts as part of the rhetorical strategies we deploy in struggling to strike a balance between 343</page><page sequence="12">MICHAEL JACKSON our familiar, local worlds, in which we feel we have the right to command our own destinies, and a world of otherness, governed variously by global forces, by the gods, by contingency or elemental powers, in which we feel far less in command, and of which we have far little understanding. To seek absolute separation between these domains is but one way of managing relations between them - hence the Maori Council's decision to keep bio- technology out of the Maori life world as a way of defending 'effective rangatiratanga' (Maori autonomy). Such declarations do not, however, preclude the possibility of seeking rapprochement between opposing domains; indeed, Maori have done just this vigorously on economic, political, educational, and cultural fronts from the first years of contact and colonization. What decides the difference between building walls and building bridges is, as in any inter- subjective encounter, the degree to which a person or group feels ontologi- cally secure. The less one's sense of comprehension and control the more one is likely to split self from other and contruct the other as alien, minatory, dirty, or dangerous. To rephrase the famous Marxian formulation, we could say that when we do not feel existentially threatened by things, relations between things assume the form of relations between persons, but when we feel exis- tentially threatened by other people, relations between people assume the form of relations between things. NOTES I am grateful for references suggested by Lena Egberg, Joachim Halse, Susanne Lundin, and for critical comments from Alf Hornborg, Sarah Pike, Tine Tjornhoj-Thomsen, Susan Reynolds Whyte, and two anonymous JRAI reviewers. 'Consider, for instance, the following lonely-hearts columnist's advice to a woman who could not bear being on her own in her single-bed flat': 'If Elaine can look around her flat and see that everything in it, from the cat to the washing-up liquid to the very air itself, is as dependent on her for its useful existence as she is dependent on it, she may get great comfort. It sounds crazy, but if she can imagine that, say, the electric blender is actually looking back at her, as she looks at it, she may find a huge sense of calm coming over her. Oh, stop laughing. Just try it' (Virginia Ironside, in The Independent, 3 May 2001: 19) 'Devereux's work on the moveable boundary between 'I' and 'not-I' and the experience of inside/outside anticipates this point (Devereux 1967: 321-8). 3In the following discussion I bracket out questions concerning the content of what is communicated via electronic means. 4Nancy Scheper-Hughes dramatically makes a similar point, referring to the stories that circulate in the poor world about organ-stealing. 'The rumours express the subjectivity of subalterns living in a "negative zone" of existence where lives and bodies are experienced as a constant crisis of presence (hunger, sickness, injury) on the one hand, and as a crisis of absence and disappearance on the other. The stories are told, remembered, and circulated because they are existentially true' (1996: 9). REFERENCES Appadurai, A. (ed.) 1986. The social life of things: commodities in cultural perspective.

Bien que je suive d'autres chercheurs cn avancant l'argument que la technologie et la societe ne peuvent etre separees, j'etudie l'interd&amp;pendance de ces dernieres de facon intersubjective, premierement en considerant quelques uns des rapports que les gens etablissent avec les ordinateurs, puis en analysant les experiences de receveurs de transplants. Je resume mes conclusions en termes d'une critique du point de vue selon lequel l'anthropomorphisme est un phenomene fondamentalement pre-moderne et je conteste l'idee que les innovations en technologie genetique et en cyber- technologie presagent une dissolution universelle et inevitable des limites entre la nature et la culture, les etres humains et les machines.
