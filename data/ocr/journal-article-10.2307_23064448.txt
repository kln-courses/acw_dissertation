<plain_text><page sequence="1">19 The Gospel a Republication of Natural Religion in Justin Martyr HENRY CHADWICK A piece dedicated in gratitude and admiration to Miroslav Marcovich may appropriately be concerned in the main with the early Christian writer who advanced the bold suggestion that in Heraclitus one might discern a Christian before Christ.1 The study of Justin Martyr reveals both the tensions and the affinities between Christian and educated pagan in the middle of the second century, at a stage of Christian expansion when the mission is marked by extraordinary confidence and when thoughtful adherents of pagan culture are coming to recognize in the Church a threat to the old ways. Yet the affinities are given more prominence than the tensions. Argument is never so hotly contentious as when it is being carried on between parties who have much in common and indeed may largely or even entirely share identical premisses. In consequence, during the second and third centuries both pagan critics of Christianity and the Christian defenders appear to the modern reader to manifest an almost bizarre schizophrenia. On the one hand, the polemical argument has to show how different and mistaken, how inconsistent and how dangerous, the opposing position is. On the other hand, each party to the dispute repeatedly insists that the side under attack is already conceding so vast a proportion of the assertions advanced by the critic that all claims to have a novel and distinctive position are throughout implausible. One can easily have the impression that pagan attackers and Christian defenders can hardly allow their left hand to know what their right hand has been writing. So in Justin's Apologies we encounter direct and candid criticism of pagan religion and morality; yet every nerve is strained to demonstrate that, on assumptions every educated person would share, Christianity is reasonable and wholly tenable by the philosophically minded, at least if the Platonic framework is accepted. (Epicurean 1 Justin, Apol. 1. 46. 3. The edition of Goodspeed, though capable of improvement, remains convenient. The Apologies are edited by A. Wartelle (Paris 1987). Heraclitus* reservations about popular cults made him congenial; cf. W. K. C.

Criticism from the pagan side is almost entirely confined to the rational arguments of moderate observers, and popular prejudices are pushed well into the background. Notoriously, Justin's thrust is directed towards splitting apart religion and philosophy. Towards pagan cult and myth3 he is vehemently negative: They are crude, superstitious, and immoral both in content and in practical influence. The cultus of animals among the Egyptians,4 the offering of human sacrifices to placate Saturn,5 and the womanising adventures of Zeus,6 stand for Justin as the typical features of the polytheism to which he and his educated readers take exception. Moreover, Justin sees pagan cult as pervaded by magic and offered to demonic spirits, addicted to sacrifices,7 incense and libations, and in his eyes the cause not only of wars, murders, and adulteries,8 but also of the unjust persecution of Christians.9 Their vicious character seems to him demonstrable from the myths of their lusts and conflicts.10 Justin could find an explanation of their existence and malevolence in the passage of Genesis 6 speaking of the sons of God who lusted after the daughters of men.11 But in Plutarch12 or, later, in Porphyry one finds pagan writers allowing that among demons some are not helpful mediatorial beings between man and the gods but malevolent powers needing to be placated by sacrifices. In the Laws (896e) Plato himself had suggested that the omnipresence of evil in the cosmos might be explained by postulating an evil world-soul. Porphyry thought these unsatisfactory unhelpful spirits were ambitious beings aspiring to a divine honour which was above their station in life.13 They suffered from envy of higher purity, and attracted damp vapours in the sublunary realm.14 Porphyry thought Hebrew sages, among whom he was willing to number Jesus, were right to forbid the cult of evil demons and inferior spirits.15 From such texts it seems natural to deduce that Justin's demonology was not a conception of 2Apol. 2.7.3,12.5. 3 Apol. 1.25 and 27, 2. 12. 4 Apol. 1.24. 5 Apol. 2. 12. 5. 6 Apol. 1.21.4-5. 7 In the Dialogue with Trypho (35) Justin has to meet the accusation that many who take the name of Christian eat meat offered to idols. He has to disown such people as gnostic heretics. 8 Apol. 2. 5. 4. 9 Apol. 1. 12. 5, Dial. 131.2. 10 Apol. 2. 12. 5 sees Zeus as a dangerous example to follow; cf.

Admittedly, without such propitiation, Porphyry believed that they would be malevolent, using magic to deceive, and ready to devise all manner of evil.20 Nevertheless, to the educated pagan observer, Christianity appeared alien, "barbarian" in origin and in content.21 The rejection of polytheistic cults, the scorning of temples and their images, the puritan refusal to join in the celebrations at traditional festivals, the treasonable talk of a kingdom commanding a loyalty beyond that owed to the emperor,22 easily imparted plausibility to allegations of sexual orgies and child-murder and cannibalism.23 It was not a nice thing to be labelled an atheist24 Yet the Christians made no secret of their abandonment of traditional religious customs, those rites by which celestial favour could be ensured for the fertility of crops and spouses and for the defence of the limes. To the charge of abandoning well-tried ways Justin would retort that truth is surely to be followed rather than custom.25 But the argument was not perhaps very effective when addressed to people who took it for granted that ancient custom in religion was the ultimate criterion of truth.26 Academic scepticism had certainly eroded old beliefs. Augustine was to comment that the gods demolished in philosophical lecture-rooms were mercilessly mocked in theatres.27 Yet scepticism (as in Montaigne) can give potent reinforcement to tradition by undermining confidence that one can produce a coherent alternative. 16 On Justin's demonology, see H.

The old argument of the Hellenistic synagogue in favour of the priority of Moses over against Greek literature and philosophy is strongly restated: Plato's Timaeus is indebted to Genesis for its cosmogony; the X in the structure of the cosmos (Tim. 34a-b and 36b) betrays awareness of the significance of the Cross as a sign of redemption.28 The oracular saying in Plato's second letter (312e) that the third things are about the third (person)29 refers to the biblical truth that in the second place is the Logos of God, and beside the Logos in the third place the Spirit borne over the water. Likewise Justin felt sure that the Hebrew prophets were the inspiration of the Greek philosophers who taught the immortality of the soul, punishment of the wicked after death, and the contemplation of celestial realities.30 Thence the philosophers derived "seeds of truth" (a theme adumbrated in Justin's first Apology and restated in the second).31 Above all in importance for Justin's theodicy, Plato's emphatic exemption of God from responsibility for evil, which originates in mistaken free choices (Rep. 10, 617e), must come from Moses (Dt. 30. 15 and 19).32 Sensitivity to the defence against gnosticism made Justin hot in his assertion of free will. He therefore had to take special care with his argument from fulfilled prophecy. Divine foreknowledge, based on foreseen merits, is distinct from fate.33 In his first Apology Justin is conscious of facing intelligent and educated critics for whom the Christian story is striking by its lack of distinctiveness. What does the Church say that cannot be found in philosophers like Plato?34 The Christians present as sober historical events narratives about Jesus which have close analogies in the pagan myths of which they speak so scornfully. The birth from a virgin is very like the legend of the birth of Perseus, born to Danae when she was made pregnant by Zeus in the disguise of a shower of gold.35 The elevation of Christ to 28 Apol. 1.59-60. 29 Apol. 1. 60. 6-7.

Ancient discussions of determinism were familiar with the question whether correct oracular predictions are compatible with indeterminism. A specimen of the debate occurs in Origen, Cels. 2. 20 and in Alexander of Aphrodisias, De fato 10 and 31 (ed. R. W. Sharpies). See also my Boethius (Oxford 1981) 159. 34 Apol. 1. 60. 10 meets the complaint that what is true is trite, and what is not trite is not true. 35 Apol. 1. 33. 3.

Celsus compares Jesus' resurrection to the elevation of Asclepius, Dionysus, and Heracles (Cels. 3. 42), and even at one point to the notorious Hadrianic favourite, Antinous (3. 36). 37 Cels. 3. 24. 38 Apol. 1.62. 1. 39 Apol. 1. 66. 4.

Origen (Cels. 6. 27 and 40) records that, although these slanders had in his time become generally discredited even among the masses, it was still possible occasionally to meet people who suspected some truth in the rumours. 41 Apol. 1. 30, Dial. 69.7. 43 Apol. 1. 30, Dial. 69. 7; cf. Celsus in Origen, Cels. 1. 6 and 38. Justin affirms that magic is among the diabolical activities which Christians renounce (Apol. 1. 14. 1-2). 44 In comparison with the Dialogue wilh Trypho, where references to the resurrection of Jesus are not infrequent (e.g. Dial. 107 f. and 138. 1), the Apologies have little to say about it except Apol. 1. 45. 1, 46. 5 (birth, death, resurrection, ascension) and 1. 19 (not more incredible than the development of a human being from a tiny sperm). Of the incarnation, Justin observes that pagans do not grasp the "mystery" (Apol. 1.13. 4). ^ Apol. 1.33.3; cf. Origen, Cels. 1. 39. The story that at Delphi Apollo entered the body of the Pythian priestess through her genitals is, for Origen (Cels. 3. 25 and 7. 3), evidence of the spirit's impure nature.</page><page sequence="6">242 Illinois Classical Studies 18 (1993) superstition and also claim that their basic stories about Jesus are strikingly in line with old Greek myths, of which the Christians held a low opinion. On the latter ground Justin is happy to be able to ask what pagans are objecting to when they have to grant their own gods to be the subject of remarkably similar narratives. Another feature of Christian belief and practice to which pagans took exception was the obstinacy impelling them towards the virtual suicide of martyrdom, like suicide in being irrational and at the same time perhaps an aggressive form of self-assertion over against society.46 Justin pertinently instances Socrates as a martyr in a religious cause.47 Heraclitus' criticisms of polytheistic cult also made it possible for him to be numbered among witnesses to the truth that evil demons were doing so much to suppress,48 even if it was not easy to claim that his eccentric death (of which Diogenes Laertius offers a number of unexciting variants)49 was the climax of his testimony. Justin's parallel of Musonius Rufus with Socrates50 was already current in Neopythagorean circles in Justin's time. Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana reports how his hero secretly communicated with Musonius when he was in Nero's dungeon to ask if he could do anything to get him out: Had not Socrates gone to his death because he refused to let his friends use their influence on his behalf? Musonius replied that Socrates simply failed to defend himself, which he himself had no intention of omitting to do.51 Origen likewise put Socrates and Musonius in parallel as heroes of integrity.52 The parallel recurs in the emperor Julian.53 Fearlessness in face of death was so prominent a theme in Stoic moral exhortation that it was not difficult for Christian apologists to defend their heroes. In practice, of course, persecuted believers were human, and felt powerful temptations to surrender to the trivial demand to offer incense on the altar of the gods or the emperor: It seemed (reports Origen) "superfluous and foolish to endure persecution for Christ's sake."54 In reply to Celsus' scornful judgement that Christian martyrdom is futile and 46 For discussion of the affinity and distinction between martyrdom and suicide, see A. Droge and J. Tabor, A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom among ancient Jews, Christians, Greeks, and Romans (San Francisco 1989).

But there is a radical difference between the willingness to die and the will to die.59 A common pagan objection to Christian proclamation was the fear of hell. The Christian preacher seemed to be producing a bogy to frighten simple people into joining the Church.60 It was difficult for pagan critics to achieve complete consistency at this point. Justin could comfortably observe that the Christian notion of a consuming fire at the end of time was strikingly similar to the Stoic doctrine that at periodic intervals the cosmos is dissolved into fire.61 He could observe that (even if the language might be mythological) belief in hell had a highly beneficial effect on personal morality.62 The wicked are those reluctant to think there is retribution hereafter.63 To affirm a personal moral responsibility for doing good or evil in this life implies for Justin belief in heaven and hell: God's accounts are not settled in this life.64 He felt sure that after death souls retain power of sensation65 and, moreover, that while there is a waiting state between death and resurrection (only gnostic heretics hold that souls ascend to heaven immediately after death),66 it is vain to hope that in hell there will still be 55 Cels. 8. 54. 56 Cels. 2. 17. 57 Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 4. s*Apol. 1.39.4. 59 Apol. 2. 4. 60 Apol. 2. 9. 61 /Ipo/. 1. 57. 1.

Plato himself wrote of judgement after death with punishments for evildoers.70 Those who laugh at Christian eschatological expectation are people who are not serious about morality. But none is more insistent on freedom of choice as lying at the root of evil than Plato who, in this as in many other matters, was indebted to Moses (above, page 240).71 Justin saw a threat to moral responsibility in the Stoic language about heimarmene.12 Nevertheless, he was also sure that some angels and some human beings become so deeply wicked as to be unchangeably evil.73 The end of the world is coming, but is delayed to make up the fixed number of God's elect;74 for God foreknows some, perhaps not yet born, who are to be included among the saved.75 Moreover, the presence of Christian believers in the world is a ground for God to defer its final destruction.76 Justin felt bound to allow that the conscience of some has been so corrupted that they suffer from diminished responsibility; they are, so to speak, moral alcoholics unable to help themselves 77 But the concession is not consistent with his more prominent theme that we go astray because we know what is right and lack the will to do it. Because Justin is an apologist concerned to correct prejudice and misinformation, he can also stress that the sin of the heathen results from ignorance. If everyone really knew what Christianity is and says, no one would sin.78 Divine revelation abolishes all ignorance,79 and the incarnation of the divine Word has destroyed the power of the Devil to obscure the truth.80 For the Logos is constantly at work in the conscience of all.81 Hence Justin's conviction that the divine Sower has sown seeds of truth everywhere, and that philosophy itself is among the 61 Apot. 1.52. 8. 68 Dial. 130. 2. Gehenna is "a place for unbelievers" (Apol. 1. 19. 8).

The presupposition of the first Apology is that divine revelation is not confined to a small elite, but is addressed to the whole of humanity. In defence of Christian disparagement of polytheistic myth and cult, Justin is glad to appeal to Plato's expulsion of Homer and other poets from his ideal state; he expelled the demonic spirits of polytheism.82 Justin's doctrine of God is characteristically expressed in the terminology of contemporary Middle Platonism:83 largely abstract, with many negative terms. God is immutable, nameless, unbegotten, utterly transcendent.84 Plato's Timaeus owes a large debt to Genesis.85 In accordance with Platonic principles, God is in no need of anything, not even of the created order;86 yet his creative power is undiminished in the generosity of his giving.87 At this point Justin faced a problem: He belonged to a community which possessed the prophetic inspired scriptures. These could be misinterpreted to mean that God is imagined to have human characteristics, mental or physical. In the Dialogue with Trypho, Justin deplores the anthropomorphism which results from a too literalistic exegesis.88 To the question, "Why did the Jews fail to recognize the Messiah when he came?" Justin's answer includes the claim that they did not understand how their own scriptures were to be interpreted.89 They did not see that the prophets speak of two comings, one in humble suffering, another in glory.90 That Jesus was born a Jew, and indeed observed the precepts of the Torah, is for Justin a truth to be emphasized.91 But his teaching is the universal way to the good life, to happiness, and to salvation.92 "By the mystery of Christ crucified God had mercy on all believers of every race."93 Therefore, the Church is expanding throughout the known world.

Fear of persecution is not the motive which keeps Christians from observing the Torah (Dial. 19; cf. 39. 6). Christ reveals the meaning of prophecies whose meaning is not understood (Apol. 1. 32. 2). 90Apol. 1. 52. 3,Dial. 31-33,49. 2, 52, 110. 2, 111, 121.3. 91 Dial. 61. 6, 100.2 ff. 92 Apol. 2.2. 13, Dial. 142.3. 93 Dial. 106. 1; cf. 96. 2, "we say to all, You are our brothers . .."

What the biblical writers particularly tell us concerns the beginning and the end of things.100 The philosophers can help with matters in between. Platonism particularly helped Justin by providing a transcendentalist language for talking about God: The Timaeus (28c) justified belief in special revelation by the saying that "it is not easy to find the Father of all, and harder still to declare him."101 So the incarnation is "mystery," and the scriptures (i.e. the Hebrew scriptures) require special illumination if they are to be rightly interpreted.102 In the Dialogue with Trypho, Justin works with the axiom that the Hebrew scriptures contain matter unworthy of God unless they receive a Christian and spiritual interpretation.103 To a philosophical mind it is self evident that God has no need of sacrifices.104 If the Mosaic law is final, how can Jeremiah prophesy the gift of a new covenant?105 The particularity of the Torah is a barrier preventing the universality of divine revelation reaching all peoples. In another instance of primitivist assumption that in religion the most ancient is the most authentic, Justin can claim that Christianity is identical with pre-Abrahamic religion before circumcision was prescribed.106 Circumcision was not applied to Adam, and therefore 94 Apol. 1.26.1. 95 Apol. 1. 53. 2; cf.
