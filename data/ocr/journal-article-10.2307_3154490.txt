<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME TYPES OF NEW THEOLOGY One of the most interesting movements in the theological world today is the evident renaissance of interest in the constructive problems of religious belief. The period of negation or of uncertainty which prevailed so long as systematic theology insisted on preserving an a-priori, dogmatic method, while all other sciences were adopting the inductive method, is disappearing as men with a vital interest in religion are attempting to construct from empirical data a theology which shall meet the religious needs of the modem man. As an inevitable result of the freedom of method adopted by the new movement, the constructive results are widely different in content; but all preserve the common trait of attempting to correlate religious beliefs with the vital convictions of science or of social life. The Crown Theological Library has already published several volumes dealing with various problems of modern theological thought. Under the title, The Religion of Christ in the Twentieth Century, an anonymous author portrays from the point of view of a liberal Englishman the present status of Christianity, and marks out the path by which he believes it is to advance.' He emphasizes the fact that men are weary of disputing over theological terms and formulae, and are eager to engage in the search for vitality. The religion of the twentieth century, therefore, must be one which proves itself so vital to the spiritual interests of men that it needs no external authority to commend it.

Criticism has thus seemed largely negative, because it has denied the validity of many of the older doctrines. This intellectualism is happily vanishing, and the meaning of doctrines is now sought in the historical conditions under which they were formulated. The most striking positive conclusion which the author reaches is that the Christianity of the future will cease to look for super- natural power from another world, but will turn with high expectations to the as yet unrealized resources of this world. Jesus becomes the supreme religious genius to guide life here, rather than the supernatural redeemer to transfer men into blessedness in another world. Something of the same feeling concerning the unreality of the traditional supernaturalism is seen in Mr. Campbell's much-discussed The New Theology.2 He, too, repudiates the dualistic view which has prevailed in theology. The universe is not a finished creation, existing apart from God, but is the eternal expression of the divine energy, ever filled with the presence of God. The real distinction to be made is not that between divine and secular, but between perfect and imperfect manifestations of the divine nature. Since love is the essence of the divine nature, all beings which fail to express the highest degree of love are inadequate expressions of God. Sin in man is described as a "blundering quest for God." Christ is the perfect incarnation of the divine nature which in a lesser degree every man possesses. The atonement is the eternal attempt of God to express himself more completely in imperfect man, in order that man may be more godlike. This constant dynamic relation between God and all parts of the universe seems to one who thinks in terms of the old dualistic cosmology to be prac- tically pantheism. And it must be confessed that the strict monism of the system does not seem to make a ready place for those moral distinctions which are essential to Christianity. On this view, the only trouble with the sinner is that he is ignorant. He does not know the right way to seek God. We pity him for his ignorance, but we cannot blame him. Redemp- tion would consist in showing him a better way in which to fulfil his desires, not in seeking to change his desires. All this may be a very satisfactory monistic philosophy, but I doubt whether the sinner himself would recognize the diagnosis of his case. Mr. Campbell displays a vigorous hostility to traditional theological opinions which will hardly serve to help matters. In many instances, he cannot escape the charge of having caricatured those doctrines in order to 2 The New Theology. By R. J.

He can hardly complain if some of his critics retort by caricaturing his own views. Hegelian interpretations of Chris- tianity have always been so different from the historical forms of Christian belief that it has been easy to look down in scorn upon the crude doctrines of the church. Historical Christianity was viewed by Hegel as a lower, popular attempt to express what is more accurately set forth in Hegelian dialectic. The Cairds, with their tolerant spirit, and with their rhetorical facility in putting new content into the old formulae, partially concealed this inevitable difference between historical Christianity and Hegelianism. In Mr. Campbell's book, the antithesis is plainly recognized. It is ques- tionable whether a "new. theology" which makes so little use of a sympa- thetic historical study of Christianity, and which makes the basis of theology to rest upon a monistic philosophy which is far from being universally accepted in our modern world-which is, in fact, being hard pressed by a more empirical method of arriving at foundation beliefs-will prove to be epoch-making in any sense. A much more profound understanding of the psychological basis of religious belief, and a much more sympathetic valua- tion of traditional beliefs is essential to any theology of permanent value. A book which starts from the difficulties which have been raised by modern biblical criticism, and which attempts to show that the essentials of the old gospel may be held on the basis of such criticism, has been pub- lished by another Englishman.3 The author sees in the modem scientific, philosophical, and critical movements a real "Praeparatio Evangelica." Our traditional stereotyped conceptions of Christianity have been dissolved, and the world has been compelled to come back to the New Testament with an inquiring mind. Thus errors in our conceptions are to be removed, and a truer apprehension of the gospel attained. In the center of this new field of inquiry stands the person of Jesus. Former ages approached him with the a-priori judgments of a supernaturalistic Zeitgeist. We, on the contrary, work under the influence of a naturalistic spirit. The author, in a few brilliant pages, warns us against the mistake of assuming that our presuppositions are so infallible that the mere collision of the New Testament records with those presuppositions shall be assumed to be sufficient reason for rejecting the New Testament. He shows the dilemma into which a naturalistic explanation of Jesus forces men. If the trustworthiness of the ecords is assumed while at the same time we insist on a merely human esus, then the "noxious exaggeration about his own personality" becomes defect in his character.

But if they were so mistaken, how can we hope through their mistaken reports to arrive at any sure conclusions ? The simplest, and as the author believes, the most truthful way out of the difficulty, is to distrust the a-priori antisupernaturalism which dominates such criticism. By admitting a transcendent element in Jesus, we are better able to account for all the facts. There can be no doubt that Mr. Cairns's warning is needed; but his book is by no means free from an a-priori coloring. For example, he wishes to preserve both the accuracy of the gospel records and the infallibility of Jesus. But Jesus predicted his speedy bodily return in triumph, according to the gospels. Was he, or were the evangelists mistaken? Mr. Cairns says, Neither. Jesus used apocalyptic language as a symbolic way of indicating that his death did not mean the end of the messianic hopes, but only Jesus' entrance into a higher sphere of power. The gradual growth of the kingdom to its full consummation on earth was Jesus' ideal. Mr. Cairns thus holds that the evangelists gave a correct report of Jesus' words, but a mistaken interpretation of those words. The author holds that essential Christianity means the brotherhood of the Kingdom, under the leadership of God revealed and potent in Christ. The concluding chapter, which portrays the break-up of the old world, politically, internationally, scientifically, industrially, and socially, shows that the immediate future is to be the most plastic period of history in cen- turies. The rediscovery of true Christianity ought to give rise to the most mighty evangelical movement the world has ever known. The volumes of the Crown Theological Library have made English and American readers familiar with many valuable works of German scholar- ship which would otherwise be accessible only to those who read German. One of the most welcome volumes is a cheaper edition of Herrmann's Communion of the Christian with God.4 It is exceedingly difficult to translate Herrmann's concise style into readable English, and the volume reflects some of the studied attempts of the translator. It thus lacks the vigor of the original and occasionally misrepresents the thought of the German. In particular the unvarying use of the word " Protestant" for the German word evangelisch often diverts attention from the real signifi- 4 The Communion of the Christian with God.

But we should be grateful to have Herrmann's message in any form. He fully recognizes the spirit of freedom in modern scholarship. He would release theology from all legalistic bonds. So thoroughly in earnest is he in this regard, that he would not even substitute for the dogmas of the church the dogmas of the historical critic. The Christian is not to begin by accepting on the authority of someone else cer- tain doctrines or certain Heilsthatsachen. A faith which rests on a man's determination to affirm the truth of certain theories or of certain alleged occurrences is the product of man's own striving, and not the experience of divine power. For this religious reason philosophical speculation must also be excluded. One is to come into the presence of the New Testament narratives and is to let them freely make their own impression upon the heart. The character of Jesus convinces us of his right to command our allegiance. In moral surrender to him, the Christian experiences com- munion with the God of Jesus in such a way that Jesus becomes the revela- tion of God. The experience which Herrmann describes is the typical Lutheran experience of justification by faith. Forgiveness and assurance of God's favor are the primary elements. One is led to question, however, whether contact with the Jesus of the Gospels will give to one so definite a content of faith. May it not be that it will simply awaken a keener loyalty to the content of religious belief which one has been educated to think Christian? But however that may be, the modern world owes to Herrmann a great debt for his unwearied insistence on the central ele- ment of communion with God as the primary thing in religion, and for his clear exposition of the fact that Jesus was not primarily a teacher of doctrine or of morals, but an embodiment of a unique God-consciousness, which has immediate significance for the religious aspirations of man. Another volume of the series gives translations of three addresses deliv- ered before sessions of the Evangelical-Social Congress in Germany.5 The first two essays by Harnack bear the titles "The Evangelical Social Mission in the Light of the History of the Church" and "The Moral and Social Significance of Modern Education." The essay by Herrmann will be the most welcome part of the book, although its significance is concealed by the suppression of part of the original title. Why the translator should have omitted so suggestive a secondary phrase as "Their Misuse, and Their Proper Use," from the original theme, "The Moral Teachings of Jesus," is not clear.

On the one hand, since Jesus said nothing about the problems of modern industrial life, men feel that they are followers of Jesus while they are not addressing them- selves at all seriously to the moral problems connected with industrial life. On the other hand, the presence of precepts which no one pretends to obey literally leads to hypocrisy on the part of those who profess to be disciples. Moreover, recent historical criticism shows that Jesus lived in a world so. different from ours, and held such views concerning the future of the world, that we cannot now share his world-view. Can we, then, find in him a guide for our moral problems ? Herrmann holds that what at first seems to separate us from Jesus turns out in the end to be a blessing; for it forces us away from the superficial study of isolated precepts to an attempt to un- derstand the real inner life of Jesus. This inner life brings to us such a vision of complete religious and moral triumph, that it becomes the rock on which we may build in our effort to do in our day what Jesus did in his- see for ourselves the immediate moral issues and directly attempt to bring the moral solution. This essay is a welcome contribution.to a problem which is bound to perplex many persons when once the views of modern criticism become familiar. Professor Jones has already published two or three little books in which his eager desire to make religion a vital matter is evident. His last booklet6 builds on the foundations laid in his Social Law in the Spiritual World.7 The starting-point is his doctrine of the "conjunct self." The older theologies assumed that man is an isolated being, who must become ac- quainted with an alien universe. God, as the transcendent cause of that universe was even more remote from man. Only by a special revelation could he become known. The new psychology, on the contrary, declares that man is never isolated. His consciousness develops because it is in vital relation to the "wider self" surrounding consciousness. "There must be a spiritual matrix for this living, throbbing, growing social organism in which personal life is formed" (p. 24). Our ideals and aspirations, therefore, are genuine experiences of a vital contact with God. We do not have to devise some extraordinary means of discovering a transcendent, self-centered God. We have only to follow the lead of the spiritual interrelation involved in our mystic and ethical longings to find the imma- nent God. But the search of man for God in this mutual relationship involves a similar search of God for the inmost being of man. The 6 The Double Search; Studies in Atonement and Prayer. By Rufus M.

I67.</page><page sequence="7">71o THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY atonement represents the divine side of this mutual search, and prayer represents the human side. Both the atonement and prayer are thus made vital aspects of the religious life. Such an exposition will doubtless prove helpful to those who are somewhat familiar with modem psychology. The trained thinker, however, will be likely to ask whether the other side of the conjunct self can be so accurately described. Still, even if one be more agnostic than Professor Jones, there is still the root of vital religious life in the fact of our conjunct relation. The starting-point for theology has been transferred from a God supposed to exist apart from experience to the vital experience of spiritual incompleteness until we find ourselves in the larger whole. The path is open for an empirical development of faith. From the point of view of one whose training and interest lie in the field of natural science, Dr. Pritchett publishes five capital addresses to students in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.8 The man of science is primarily interested in truthfulness. Hypocrisy of any sort seems to him to be the chief sin. The pursuit of scientific studies, Dr. Pritchett declares, ought to equip one to assume toward the problems of life the sanest spiritual attitude. If scientific training does not bear fruitage in spiritual life, there is something wrong either with the science or with the man. The entire emphasis is therefore laid not on the conclusions to which one comes in his religious thinking, but on the inner spirit of truth. In Dr. Pritchett's thinking, the "conjunct self" of the psychologist becomes the "infinite and eternal energy" of Herbert Spencer. In both cases, the anthropomorphic picture of God is gone, and religion means the attempt to come into more intimate relations with the immanent spiritual power in the universe. Dr. Pritchett,, however, is more willing than Professor Jones to leave the exact nature of the Infinite undefined. He feels that to attempt to square his thinking with any formulae, even those of the New Testa- ment, would be to encourage a lack of sincerity which would defeat inner spiritual truthfulness. As a wholesome possible starting-point for men who have the scientific spirit, the addresses are admirable. But will even the scientist be content to remain permanently in so agnostic and vague an attitude toward what he calls God? Unquestionably Dr. Pritchett himself would agree that a more definite theology is desirable, provided it can come in a genuinely scientific spirit. The book would be an especially valuable one for those preachers whose religious vision is limited to a tech- nical theological vocabulary. One cannot but be impressed with the vigor and vitality of these modern 8 What Is Religion? and Other Student Questions. By Henry S. Pritchett.

The desire for constructive interpretation of genuine spiritual experience is dominant. It would seem that the cause of religion has little to fear and much to hope for from this new interest in theology. GERALD BIRNEY SMITH UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO</page></plain_text>
