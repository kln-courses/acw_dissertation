<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Puritan Origins of the American Seif. SARCAN BER- COVITCH. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1975. Pp. x+250. $15.00 The title of Cotton Mather's life of John Winthrop, Nehemias Americanus, salutes the first governor of New England for his per- sonal virtue, his administrative wisdom, and his contribution to an epic venture. Nehemiah led the Israélites back from Babylon to their promised land, served as first governor of their restored theocracy, and inspired the growth of a vigorous, well-managed state. The conjunction of his name with "America" provided Mather with an especially meaningful title. Examining the words of the title somewhat in the manner of a Puritan preacher "opening" a text, Sacvan Bercovitch embarks on a lengthy and detailed investigation of the impact of Puritan think- ing on American thinking.

Utilizing com- paratist arguments, Bercovitch demonstrates that Mather syn- thesized the disparate biographical methods of his time to expand parallele with Nehemiah from civic to moral exemplum and thence to exemplum fidel "As the public and private meanings of his biographical parallele converge, they form a soteriological ex- emplum of astonishing breadth and cohérence. Mather's Winthrop is a man représentative of his profession, of his society, of sainthood, of his biographer, and, as 'Americanus,' of the con- junction of all of these with the providential wonders, the miracula apocalypsis, that demarcate the forward sweep of redemptive history" (p. 71). Comparing Mather with his English counterparts - writers like Foxe, Baie, Knox, and Clarke - Bercovitch argues that the New England divine infused the term "American" with a meaning both more comprehensive and more privileged than Foxe's concept of national élection. "Americanus" symbolized the véritable fusion of sainthood and nationality. It reflected thinking which conferred upon America a status of visible sainthood with far-reaching im- plications. This concept "contributes significantly to the link between the New England and the American way, to the usur- pation of American identity by the United States, and to the anthropomorphic nationalism that characterizes our literature - not the secular anthropomorphism of parenthood (British homeland, German fatherland), but the eschatological anthropomorphism of spiritual biography: American dream, manifest destiny, redeemer nation, and, fundamentally, the American self as représentative of universal rebirth" (p. 108). Bercovitch contrasts the Puritan's view of America with that of other New World colonists, and traces some manifestations of their thinking through the early national period into the American Renaissance. Emerson, he suggests, achieved a blending of Romantic naturalism and Puritan hermeneutics. The influence of Puritan conceptions on Emerson is discussed at some length, preparatory to a promised full-scale évaluation of the man and the period. Bercovitch is exceptionally well informed. He uses his sources</page><page sequence="3">284 BOOK REVIEWS well and writes with a caution perhaps not adequately reflected in this brief summary. He has contributed a subtle and imaginative interprétation which adds substantially to our understanding of the Puritan origins of the American seif.
