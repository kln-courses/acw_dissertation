Those philosophers who view science as a rational activity have generally agreed on the aim of theoretical science: a simple unifying explanatory scheme in which the rich diversity of empirical phenomena are comprehended in an economical framework of fundamental theoretical laws. Of course, there are sharp divisions concerning the status of these fundamental laws. Realists would claim them to be susceptible of a semantics of truth and falsehood, a move resisted by anti-realists. But both realists and anti-realists would see the progress of science in terms of a wider and wider variety of empirical phenomena being comprehended under fundamental theoretical schemes. There is again the distinct issue of reductionism, whether the whole of science can be unified in terms of the most fundamental theories in physics, but unification, either partial or global, has certainly been a regulative ideal in the pursuit of science. It has to be admitted that there is a practical difficulty in that the fundamental equations of elementary particle physics, for example, cannot actually be solved mathematically (analytically or by numerical computation) except for very special cases. So the physicist has in many problems of interest to him to proceed in the following way. He has to replace the actual theoretical laws by simplified 'models', whose empirical predictions may have to be adjusted by essentially ad hoc phenomenological corrections in order to secure reasonable agreement with observation. So much of theoretical physics is in practice a messy concatenation of inconsistent models of dubious status both vis-a- vis the fundamental theory and the observational data. Professor Cartwright in her new and provocative book has decided to make a virtue out of necessity and claims that that is all there really is to physics, the messy models, and the simple underlying unifying theories are just a foolish myth. She is a realist, not about the fundamental laws, but about the entities entertained by them, and their causal role in producing observable effects. There is, however, a basic non-sequitur in the argument she presents. She claims that the phenomenologically corrected models are more accurate than the fundamental laws in making empirical predictions and this argues for the truth of the former and the falsity (or perhaps better the non- applicability since she is not a realist about the fundamental laws) of the latter. This is the sense in which she claims the laws of physics lie. But how can she know this, when she admits that the fundamental laws themselves are much too intractable in the examples she typically discusses. How can one know a law lies if one does not know, in a particular case, what it predicts, not because it does not make a prediction, but because we have not got the mathematical skills to tell what the prediction is? The most we should infer is the old Scottish verdict of not proven. Having rejected, even in principle or as an idealised goal of science, the search for deep unifying explanations, Cartwright has to give some other account of what constitutes a good explanation. She proposes what she calls a simulacrum account, which amounts to the existence of a (non-unified) model for dealing with the phenomenon to be explained. Here there seems to be the same confusion between prescriptive and descriptive modes of discourse. In practice physicists do use models for explanation, but does this make the explanations good, rather than defective, as some philosophers of science would want to claim? Cartwright gives an interesting discussion of the composition of causes-in what sense, for example, do two component forces contribute 'in reality' to the resultant? Again, I think, she is too quick in dismissing the conclusion that component causes</page><page sequence="2">514 BOOK REVIEWS may be regarded as really operating even in the composite situation. However, one might want to take issue with Cartwright about her insistence on the appropriate- ness of causal talk in physics at all. Many philosophers of science would regard this as vestigial anthropomorphism. But Cartwright regards the identification of causes as a vital ingredient in any genuine explanation. In the final essay in the book Cartwright discusses the problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. Previously she thought this could be 'solved' in terms of the usual Schrodinger unitary time evolution. But now she rejects this. Non-unitary evolutions occur as well, not just in measurements, but in other situations such as scattering phenomena. This is gone into in considerable technical detail and it is claimed that scattering can be completely understood as issuing in a mixture of momentum eigenstates. Suffice it to say that this cannot be right since any mixture of momentum eingenstates has a uniform spatial distribution and hence cannot describe the angular anisotropies that arise in scattering cross-sections. The book as a whole is a collection of essays, most of which have been previously published, in whole or part, during the last ten years. As a result there is a certain amount of repetition, and the same examples, such as the physics of lasers, tend to be cited repeatedly. This review has been critical, but the issues raised are very important and highly controversial. It is written in an attractively simple and direct style, and I believe the book to be of importance in inviting philosophers to take a new look at the way physics is actually done, and what their reaction to that practice should be.
