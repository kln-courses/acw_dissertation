<plain_text><page sequence="1">Becoming Animal in Paul Muldoon's Horse Latitudes Lynn Keller Ecocritical approaches to Paul Muldoon's poetry might examine its relation to place and particularly to rural landscapes, consider how environmental justice issues appear in its critiques of colonialism, analyse the uses to which Muldoon puts his prodigious knowledge of nonhuman species and their biological interdependencies, or consider from an animal studies perspective the role of nonhuman animals in his work. This essay comes closest to the last, but its aim is more general: it proposes that the poetry of Paul Muldoon reflects a set of philosophical attitudes with significant environmentalist ramifications. I will argue that key aspects of Muldoon's writing can be illuminated by and reflect understandings similar to ideas developed by feminist philosopher and environmental theorist Rosi Braidotti in her books Nomadic Subjects and Transpositions : On Nomadic Ethics , both of which build on the ideas of Gilles Deleuze.1 Muldoon's poetry, I contend, demonstrates the nomadic subjectivity that Braidotti values, namely, an iconoclastic, non-unitary, boundary- crossing subjectivity defined in terms of processes of becoming. Invested in the 'subversion of set conventions' and in 'a total dissolution of the notion of center and consequently of originary sites or authentic identities', the nomadic subject does not take any kind of identity as permanent and is open to unlikely encounters and transitions.2 The slipperiness of temporal and geographical location; the unpredictable shifts of perspective, focus, and emotional tenor; and even the heterogeneity of lexicons characteristic of Muldoon's writing all contribute to producing a nomadic subjectivity in his poems.3 However, I wish to take the argument further, for in such a nomadic consciousness Braidotti sees possibilities for freeing our thinking from the hold of phallocentric dogmatism. Muldoon, whose speakers have no qualms about seeing women as sexual objects, may sometimes appear to have few quarrels with phallocentrism, yet the implied politics of his poetry suggest a long-standing attraction to Utopian models of egalitarian social structures. Examined through the lens of Braidotti' s theories, the fluidity of perspective in his work points to ways of thinking about human relations to the physical environment, including human relations to nonhuman species, that escape the limits of conventional viewpoints in which the human,</page><page sequence="2">Nordic Irish Studies specifically the male human, is at the centre - even if his speakers, who should not be too readily mapped onto Muldoon himself, are sometimes bound within those conventions. Indeed, in Horse Latitudes , it is often through ethically disturbing representations or invocations of animals and also of women - the denigrated others of phallocentric, anthropocentric thought - that Muldoon invites readers to experience an alternative 'biocentered egalitarianism' which, for Braidotti, is the ethical consequence of the 'intensive interconnectedness' of nomadic becoming.4 I will develop these claims using poems from Horse Latitudes that enact some kind of 'becoming-animal',5 though not necessarily one that precisely fits Deleuze and Guattari' s model on which Braidotti is drawing. After brief consideration of the volume's title, examination of the interrelations of men, women, and horses in the 'Horse Lattitudes' sequence will show Muldoon exposing the interrelation of phallocentrism and anthropocentrism in ways that encourage the reader to enter into an alternative perspective well described by Braidotti' s nomadic subjectivity. An analysis of 'Turkey Buzzard' will then demonstrate its speaker's fall from a position of fixed, superior subjectivity prompted by a transformative encounter with an animal perspective; as in the title sequence, formal elements seem as crucial to both enabling and registering that trans- formation as are semantic elements in the poem. Continuing the attention to how the material aspects of Muldoon's poetry may both register and foster nomadic consciousness, the essay will conclude by demonstrating with three poems that evoke cross-species metamorphosis the central role that Muldoon's linguistic transformations play in enabling entrance into alternative subjectivities. Collectively, these readings suggest that many of the characteristic traits of Muldoon's elaborately playful writing, so often seen as serving to elude any particular stance or political commitment, may ultimately serve a philosophical allegiance to biocentered perspectives. Since the late eighteenth century, the term 'Horse Latitudes' has referred to 'the belt of calms and light airs that borders the NE trade winds' in the 30th to 35th parallels.6 The back cover of Muldoon's volume recounts a popular folk theory that locates the origin of the term 'in the time when Spanish sailing vessels transported horses to the West Indies'. Ships would frequently become becalmed in mid-ocean in this latitude, making it necessary for crews to 'throw their live cargo overboard to lighten the load and conserve food and water'. The more authorised explanation of the term involves sailors' practice of throwing overboard not real horses but straw 2</page><page sequence="3">Paul Muldoon's Horse Latitudes stuffed horse effigies, to mark their having worked off the 'dead horse' debt they had accrued as advance payment before going to sea. Because ships sailing from England would reach the subtropics at about the time the 'dead horse' was worked off, the region became associated with the ceremony.7 In Muldoon's collection, the most obvious significance of the title is metaphorical, signalling the volume's focus on middle age as a time of doldrums. The title's invocation of animals being sacrificed for human gain is pertinent as well, however, since such anthropocentric practices are a significant undercurrent throughout the book, particularly evident in the title sequence, the first group of poems to be discussed. The nineteen sonnets that make up 'Horse Latitudes' have titles that name the locations of well known battles that begin with the letter B - an apparently arbitrary constraint the poet imposed upon himself - and are ordered largely according to chronology.8 The titular battles, fought between the twelfth and the mid-twentieth centuries, are all contests in which horses or mules played some role. That is hardly surprising given that from several thousand years BC until World War II horses drew chariots, hauled military supplies or artillery, or served as cavalry mounts in vast numbers of military operations. The battles themselves and the roles animals played there are sometimes alluded to or discussed in the poems, though, somewhat bewilderingly, the present time action of the sequence seems mostly to involve the speaker and his wife staying at the Vanderbilt hotel in Nashville, and, in typical Muldoon fashion, the poems veer unpredictably between the two. While not all of the battle material that mentions horses suggests any meaningful encounter between man and mount, in some places Muldoon conveys a merging of the consciousness of human and nonhuman animals - as, for example, in a passage that con- cludes 'Benburb', named for a battle in 1647 during the Irish Confederate Wars, in which the Irish were victorious over the Scots. The poem recounts how the Scots 'galloped full tilt / and impaled themselves' on impromptu 'chevaux-de-frise' (anti-cavalry obstacles made up of wooden frames with long spikes on them). Here horse and rider are fused, as 'the banner- / bearing Scots' rather than horses 'galloped', and this interpénétration of identities is developed in the closing lines that depict 'horses rooted to the spots / on which they go down on their knees / as they unwind their shoulder plaids and kilts, / the checkered careers of their guts'.9 The bodies of the men and their mounts are indistinguishable; both human and nonhuman animals seem to bear on their shoulders the colours of the Scottish clans and both end up gorily disembowelled.10 Such a portrait of warfare reminds readers of the cruel hierarchy that renders nonhuman animals mere pawns in human endeavour at the same time that it conveys 3</page><page sequence="4">Nordic Irish Studies the symbiosis between horseman and horse. Using only a few lines, Muldoon points at once to western cultures' anthropocentric arrogance and also, by suggesting the possibility of becoming animal, to the potential for alternative forms of animal-human relations. The motif of military battles that runs through these poems is figuratively tied to the proverbial battle of the sexes being played out between the male speaker and his female companion, Carlotta, who, along with Carlotta' s dead grandfather, are the central figures in the sequence. This is another realm where animal and human are made to blur, as the speaker both figures and treats Carlotta as an animal. Before looking at some examples, it is worth noting a fundamental structural tension at work in these poems: They depict worlds that are governed by dichotomous oppositions, in which two armies, two sexes, two species - or more generally, human and nonhuman animals - clash. Although the battles that appear as titles run only as late as 1945, Muldoon reminds us that the present is also a time of war as the contemporary couple watch the Iraq war on TV through the reportage of 'some Xenophon / embedded with the 5th marines'. This dualistic structure is our social and philosophical inheritance, from which Deleuze, Braidotti, and, I believe, Muldoon would like to free us. The pervasive oppositions in his poems suggest the obstacles to achieving harmonious coexistence by any means, including that of enacting Deleuze' s notion of becoming on which Braidotti draws, which she regards as 'the affirmation of the positivity of difference, meant as a multiple and constant process of transformation. Both teleological order and fixed identities are relinquished in favour of a flux of multiple becoming'.11 Yet Muldoon manages such a process of transformation through the very multiplicity of the oppositions running through the poems, by making them slip vertiginously through time and space and speakerly perspective. As he puts into play multiple tales and motifs, even multiple meanings for single words, and as he invokes multiple versions of becoming-animal, varied forms of slippage open possibilities for the interactions of usually polarised elements at numerous and heterogeneous points and create non-polarised alignments and non-linear developments. The interplay of different strands creates the prolific 'inbetween space of zigzagging and crossing, non-linear but not chaotic' that Braidotti sees as produced by the cross-boundary transfers she calls transpositions.12 Additionally, as has already been noted in the case of the animal/human dichotomy, the oppositional pattern itself is called into question as one pole blurs into the other. With this in mind, it is useful to consider the blatantly misogynist portrayals of woman as animal in the 'Horse Latitudes' sequence. These 4</page><page sequence="5">Paul Muldoon's Horse Latitudes exemplify a blurring of species boundaries that takes place via the devaluation of both female human and nonhuman animal within the phallocentric system.13 In the poem 'Bull Run', Muldoon recalls the image of the dying horses unwinding their shoulder plaids as his speaker asserts, 'I loved the smell of sweat and blood and, si, horse dung / Carlotta shouldered like an Aqua Lung / as she led me now through that dewy dell / and spread her House of Tartan waterproof. The old saw that horses sweat, gentlemen perspire, and ladies glow has no traction here; women and horses stink alike. 'Bull Run' continues: As I lay there I could have sworn, as I stared through unruffled thorns that were an almost perfect fit to each side of the gravel pit where she and I'd tried to outflank each other, I traced the mark of a hoof 14 (or horseshoe) in her fontanelle. Even as the speaker animalises his lover, one might argue that the military language of 'outflanking' also animalises the speaker himself. For referring to the side of a military formation as a flank developed centuries after 'flank' meant 'the side of an animal or man between the ribs and the hip'.15 Although the image of a hoof in the woman's skull might point to a merging of consciousness and perspective that Deleuze would valorise as a liberating becoming, obviously the primary impact of the passage is to reduce the woman by turning her into both horse and infant, given that only infants' skulls have the membranous spaces designated as the fontanelle. Other examples of the speaker's animalising of the woman are even more brutal. Thus, for instance, 'Boyne' opens with the kind of temporal swerve that helps give the narrative perspective a nomadic quality as it introduces one of several scenes in which Carlotta is depicted swimming, presumably in the hotel pool: The blood slick from the horse slaughter I could no longer disregard as Carlotta surfaced like barm. My putting her through her paces As she kicked and kicked against the traces like a pack mule kicking from a yardarm before it fell, heehaw, in the dockyard.16 5</page><page sequence="6">Nordic Irish Studies The last lines in this passage link to military scenes later in the sequence, in which mules are unloaded from ships for military service and, if not killed by falling from the yardarm, end up having their vocal chords cut by Carlotta's grandfather. In the present time of 'Boyne', the speaker might be helping Carlotta train for some swimming competition, but the almost sadistic domination evident in his 'putting her through her paces' like a horse and in the simile likening her to a helpless mule suspended from the yardarm seems rhetorically calculated to generate revulsion against the speaker.17 This repulsion propels the reader to seek out for him/herself alternatives to thinking like the speaker, and the readily available option within the text is that of thinking like the poem itself - that is, thinking nomadically, occupying a perspective that refuses the fixity of an authorit- ative, controlling, hierarchical stance. That is the only readily available alternative because we are never allowed inside Carlotta's mind to see if her subjectivity might offer an alternative. However, her relation to language itself might point readers in a less hierarchical, and again nomadic, direction, since she turns out not to be bound by inherited linguistic regulations. A later poem, 'Basra', evokes that same scene at the dockyard, as Carlotta's ' nonno ' (her grandfather, who, though no longer living, remains active as an overbearing authority in the sequence, one who also seems to have participated in at least one war, as soldier and as surgeon) 'gives us the inside track / on how the mule drivers whooped and hollered / on the dock'. In this poem it is the grand- father rather than the speaker who treats Carlotta as humans treat the animals they control. However, the paces this authoritarian male puts her through are linguistic: he takes her for a 'quick whip through conjugations, declensions' and the details of grammar at which she is 'quite unscholared'. The final poem of the 'Horse Latitudes' sequence, 'Burma', concludes with a specific demonstration of this discipline, as Carlotta responds with revulsion to her grandfather's cutting the pack mules' vocal cords, and he corrects her grammar since she ended her sentence with a preposition: "Why," Carlotta wondered, "that fearsome tool? Was it for fear the mules might bray and give their position away?" At which I see him thumb the shade as if he were once more testing a blade and hear the two-fold snapping shut of his four- fold, brass-edged carpenter's rule: "And give away their position ." 6</page><page sequence="7">Paul Muldoon's Horse Latitudes Here linguistic regulation is aligned with the rigid phallocentric thinking to which anthropocentrism is fundamental, while Carlotta' s deviation from that order suggests why becoming-woman, like becoming-animal, offers a mode of thinking that promises to push readers' thinking outside received conventions of anthropocentrism. The opening sonnet sequence offers a complex exploration of nomadic subjectivity, enacting its possibility in the poems' shifting foci and perspectives. There the multifaceted linkages of animal and human at once display the absence of such subjectivity in the repellent perspective of male characters (or in much of war-dominated history) and make clear its availability for adoption by the reader. A simpler and more starkly power- ful representation of becoming animal occurs in 'Turkey Buzzards', where, in startling drama, an encounter with other-than-human-subjectivity prompts a humbling fall from a superior anthropocentric stance. Much of the poem speaks from a fixed subjectivity readily identifiable as that of Paul Muldoon, who addresses his sister Maureen (to whose memory the volume is dedicated) in that liminal time when her death from cancer is impending though perhaps not imminent. That address to 'dear Sis' does not occur, however, until the fifteenth of the poem's twenty-five rhymed quatrains that form a single tortuous sentence. The preceding fourteen stanzas seem less an elegy than a fascinated, sometimes darkly playful and occasionally anthropomorphising disquisition on buzzards and their behaviour, treating the birds largely as Deleuze and Guattari' s 'state animals' that possess characteristics or attributes; for example, its no-frills ruff, the six-foot shrug of its swing-wings, the theologian's and the thug's twin triumphings in a buzzard's shaved head and snood, buzz-buzz-buzzy, its logic in all likelihood somewhat fuzzy19 Only with the speaker's bitter references to 'that // Marcus Aurelius humbug / about what springs / from earth succumbing to the tug / at its heartstrings'20 in the eighteenth stanza and a subsequent statement about 'you [. . .] dear Sis, perhaps growing your hair' in a brief Promethean requital 'of whatever tears / at your vitals', does it become clear that the poem is an expression of profound grief. Once the emotional weight of the speaker's preoccupation with this animal so bound to 'the thick scent / of 7</page><page sequence="8">Nordic Irish Studies death' is evident, 'Turkey Buzzards' assumes the character of an elegy not for one individual but for two, the speaker as well as his sister, and then for four as, in a sudden expansion of subjectivity, the Muldoons merge with the opening's pair of avian scavengers, becoming animal at the poem's abrupt close. This merging is prepared for by accumulating suggestions of what the four beings have in common. Crucially, as the opening line, apparently about the buzzards, announces: 'They've been so long above it all'. Even for the vultures that phrase is only partly literal. Just as they glide far above the town dump or a road-killed deer, they seem above the trials of mortality, being 'soul[s] in bliss' when tearing up bloody roadkill and able to protect themselves from mortal infection through an enzyme they defecate upon themselves. Significantly, the buzzard is figured as artist or craftsperson, applying 'its tinsnips / to that grommet // in the spray-painted hind's hindgut / and making a / sweeping, too right, a sweeping cut.' While many humans have difficulty really acknowledging their own mortality, artists are perhaps particularly hampered in having long envisioned for themselves a kind of immortality achieved through their art. Muldoon invites his reader to connect the bird 'so steeped in style', who holds itself above it all, not just with any humans whose privilege and good fortune allow imagination of being untouched by common trials, but specifically with the fashionably postmodern poet whose work in its formally elaborate difficulty has kept it above the reach of many common readers. In the final quatrains, it is as if the poet/speaker who has for so long artfully suspended and extended his syntax suddenly loses control, so that the poem's sentence abruptly spirals to its close at the moment when the speaker imagines the buzzards succumbing to the physical limits of all mortal bodies. This is the transformative moment of the speaker's becoming animal. It takes place through his conjuring a situation which shifts unpredictably from being unthreatening - 'their poop containing an enzyme / that's known to boost // their immune systems, should they prong / themselves on small / bones in a cerebral cortex' - to being suddenly dangerous - 'at no small cost / to their well-being' - as the bird's seeming invulnerability disappears; with the phrase 'sinking fast', the speaker enters into the buzzard perspective on this experience. The dying bird and the poet's sentence plummet as one into the gruesome physical mortality 'common' to all human and nonhuman animals alike: . . . sinking fast in a deer crypt buzzards getting the hang at last of being stripped 8</page><page sequence="9">Paul Muldoon's Horse Latitudes of their command of the vortex while having lost their common touch, they've been so long above it all.21 The collapse of previously suspended syntax seems less a mimesis of the bird's imagined fall than an enactment of the poet-speaker's abandonment of his confidently superior stable subjectivity. Merging with both his dying sister and the buzzard that only seemed to triumph over death in a profound recognition of mortality, he is utterly humbled. Particularly since the buzzards were never gendered, his becoming both buzzard/animal and sister/woman represents a movement outside a position of gender privilege, a casting off of phallocentrism as well as anthropocentrism. As is evident from the key role syntax plays in 'Turkey Buzzards', how one handles language affects the availability of intersubjective and egalitarian perspectives. The final group of poems to be examined in this article are three poems which involve literal and/or linguistic metamorphosis. These demonstrate how Muldoon's uses of particular forms of linguistic deviation open his poetry to the 'intensive interconnectedness' of nomadic becoming. These poems enact the value of linguistic rather than bodily metamorphosis, demonstrating, as 'Turkey Buzzards' does in a different way, that it is through language and consciousness that human beings can fruitfully enter into alternative subjectivities, rather than through a biological (or bioengineered) transformation. The title of the first poem, 'Tithonus', refers to a man in Greek mythology who was loved by the immortal Eos. She asked Zeus to make her lover immortal but forgot to ask for eternal youth. Consequently, Tithonus withered into horribly decrepit old age until he was changed into a cicada, in which form he continues to beg for death to release him. Muldoon's poem traces a sound heard 'in what used to be the root cellar' through a series of misidentifications (not this, nor that) to 'what turns out to be the two-thousand-year-old chirrup / of a grasshopper'. Worth noting is the slippage of names - or of species - from the cicada of the title to the grasshopper of the close, particularly in light of the next poem in the collection, 'Bob Dylan at Princeton, November 2000'. This poem refers twice to 'locusts':22 first there is mention of 'those seventeen-year locusts hanging off the trees' and then in the poem's ominous last line 'locusts lock in on grain silo and grange'. The phrase 'seventeen-year locusts' is a common but inaccurate designation for seventeen-year cicadas, which are not locusts at all; and in fact cicadas do not do the kind of damage to crops 9</page><page sequence="10">Nordic Irish Studies for which locusts, those creatures of Biblical plagues, are infamous. Muldoon, then, gives one poem, 'Tithonus', the title of a cicada, but in an act of linguistic metamorphosis, speaks about a grasshopper, and in the next poem he refers to cicadas as locusts and attributes to the cicadas the behaviour of that quite distinct species. Muldoon' s wily defiance of so called 'accurate' nomenclature, while certainly an example of his typical horsing around, in seriousness marks Muldoon' s distancing himself from the classificatory approach to the animal that characterises Deleuze' s anthropocentrically established 'state animals'. Muldoon here aligns the poet with Carlotta as someone who uses words as if 'unscholareď, and thereby relinquishes fixed identities 'in favor of the flux of multiple becoming'.23 The final poem of metamorphosis to be analysed here, 'Glaucus', tells the story of a fixed and arrogant subjectivity, a 'King of Corinth' named Glaucus, who is said to have been torn to pieces by his own mares whom he had fed 'on choicest human flesh / to give them a taste for battle'. Its lines emphasise how trapped Glaucus remains in his arrogant perspective even as he is dismembered: 'Glaucus was still on such a roll / it was lost on him that the high point of the games / was his being eaten now by his own mares'.24 His fate of being literally consumed by horses is one version of becoming animal, but obviously not a mode of becoming readers are invited to emulate.25 Indeed, had Glaucus earlier practiced a Deleuzian becoming-animal and entered into the perspective of those 'fillies' rather than manipulating them so horribly, he might have met a less awful fate. Yet here, too, the multi-referential reach of even a single word lends nomadism to the reader's experience of identity. For, demonstrating the kind of non-linear intersection between various tales with oppositional structures that I earlier suggested Muldoon cultivates, another Glaucus shadows the Corinthian one. This Glaucus is a Greek sea god whose story in significant ways parallels - and in the context of the volume, brings to mind - that of Tithonus. Here, instead of misnaming, Muldoon plays upon the associative character of language; by calling to mind two figures with the same name, each of whom goes through a kind of becoming-animal, the poem's title evokes not a single or even a double subject, but a multidimensional one. According to Ovid, Glaucus began life as a mortal fisherman. Having discovered an herb that brought fish back to life, he ate it himself and achieved the immortality he sought but at the cost of growing fins and a fish tail instead of arms and legs and having to live in the ocean. In evoking this tale, and with it, that of Tithonus named earlier in the volume, Muldoon implicitly cautions against imagining there are physical transformations that will allow escape from our bodies' limitations. Never- 10</page><page sequence="11">Paul Muldoon's Horse Latitudes theless, his use of linguistic doublings to encourage his readers to think nomadically about identity and naming also suggests that an excellent means of escaping from either a constricting sense of self or a narrowed sense of the other is available simply through the marvellous flexibility of language, both as it is commonly used in locutions like the 'seventeen-year locust' and as it is uncommonly deployed by the poet. In language generally and especially in current poetic language, mixture and inter- contamination are the norm; these emerge in Horse Latitudes as resources that may allow us to reach beyond the exploitation of animals and other 'others' that follows from an anthropocentric perspective. *** According to Braidotti, 'The becoming-animal axis of transformation entails the displacement of anthropocentrism and the recognition of trans- species solidarity on the basis of our being environmentally based, that is to say: embodied, embedded, and in symbiosis. This organic or corporeal brand of materialism lays the foundations for a system of ethical values 26 where "life" stands central'. Critics of Muldoon's poetry have tended to read its playfully shifting mobilities as evading political or ethical commitment.27 If, as this essay has argued, however, his poetry often explores that axis of transformation, his writing may be understood as enacting an environmentally directed ethics. Braidotti pursues the possibility that an embrace of nomadic subjectivity facilitates empathy and responsibility toward the earth and all its human and nonhuman inhabitants. Muldoon's poetry, particularly as it represents the blurring of human and animal boundaries, opens that same possibility for his readers. Notes and References 1 Of particular importance to this essay is Deleuze and Guattari' s notion of 'becoming animal'. See Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987). In A Thousand Plateaus , Deleuze and Guattari contrast the ontological and epistemological perspective anchored in human subjectivity, what they call 'being perceptible', with the many and varied perspectives of nonhuman others, 'becoming imperceptible'. Claiming that anthropocentrism is effectively countered only by encountering and thinking from other-than-human perspectives, they elaborate on several of these (becoming woman, becoming 11</page><page sequence="12">Nordic Irish Studies animal, etc.) Though not merely fantasy, and in fact 'perfectly real' (238), becoming animal is not a matter of inhabiting an animal body, but of being transformed by encountering nonhuman perspectives, though to be transformative this encounter cannot be in familiar anthropomorphic terms. Deleuze and Guattari suggest that animals can be seen in three ways - as 'Oedipal' (familiar, sentimentalised, individual animals such as pets that 'belong' to a person), 'state' animals (categorised and studied to uncover models or structures), or 'more demonic animals, pack or affect animals that form a multiplicity' (241). Only when seen as 'pack animals', undercutting classificatory or Oedipal schema, do animals disrupt human conceptualisation and open the human to hybrid modes of existence. 2 Rosi Braidotti, Nomadic Subjects: Embodiment and Sexual Difference in Contemporary Feminist Theory (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994) 5. 3 Critics of Muldoon's poetry have so frequently noted these traits that they require little elaboration here.

Braidotti, Nomadic Subjects 5. 5 Not surprisingly given what Tim Kendall has called Muldoon's 'genius as an "animal" poet', these are only some of the poems in the volume that depict nonhuman animals, and in a number of these the animal and human blur. Kendall, who notes Muldoon's interest in the 'anthropomorphic potential of the animal world', is one of numerous critics who have noted the pervasiveness of animal imagery in Muldoon's work.

In horseback riding, one conserves the kinetic energy, the speed of the horse, and no longer its proteins (the motor, and no longer the flesh)'. They quote Virilio, "'horseback riding was the first projector of the warrior, his first system of arms'" and add, 'Whence becoming-animal in the war machine'.

On the other hand, however, not all forms taken by the process of becoming are equivalent'. She points out the male is the referent for thinking subjectivity, and woman is positioned as the 'other'; consequently, 'there is no possible becoming minority of man', while 'the becoming-woman is a privileged position for the minority consciousness of all [. . .]. [A] 11 the lines of deterritorializiation go necessarily through the stage of "becoming woman'" (Braidotti, Nomadic Subjects 114). For Deleuze 'the primary movement of renewal of the subject is the dissolution of gender dichotomies and of the identities that rest upon them' (Braidotti, Nomadic Subjects 115), but he has not sufficiently taken into account 'the feminist reindividuation of sexual difference, namely that there is no symmetry between the sexes' (118). 'Deleuze's "becoming woman" amalgamates men and woman into a new, supposedly beyond gender, sexuality; this is problematic, because it clashes with women's sense of their own historical struggles' (120). 14 Muldoon 16. 1 5 ' flank, n. 1 ' , OED Online, March 20 1 1 , web, 1 2 May 2011, &lt;http://oed.eom/view/Entry/7 1 082?rskey=4bdJp2&amp;result= 1 &amp;is Advanced=false&gt;. 16 Muldoon 11. 17 Repulsion is also generated in other poems containing misogynist material, such as 'Brandywine', where 'Carlotta surfaced like flot / to be skimmed off some great cast-iron pot / as garble is skimmed off, or lees / painstakingly drained by turnings and tilts / from a man-size barrel or butt' (Muldoon 14).

He argues that Horse Latitudes corrects readers' misreadings of the horse and horse-related images that have appeared throughout Muldoon' s work, and that in this self-reading 'the postmodern ironist we think we know' gives way to a 'poet of abjection and of "abject" political sympathies', a figure who was there all along (Bentley 111). Though making different arguments about Muldoon's commitments, both Bentley' s essay and mine challenge received readings of Muldoon as only 'postmodern trickster, uncommitted to any cause' and not to be pinned down to any determinable meaning (Bentley 1 13).
