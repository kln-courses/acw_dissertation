This volume completes the report of excavations on the slope east of Poundbury Camp, closely adjacent to the Roman town of Dorchester and, as has been remarked, more nearly its ancestor than Maiden Castle to the south-west. On this slope, between the 6o and 8o m contours and overlooking the valley of the river Frome to the north, lay the 'managed' neat rows, on coin-evidence creeping ever upwards towards the hillfort, of the late Roman Christian cemetery which has given Poundbury its notoriety in Romano- British studies, and its importance far beyond. The area was not virgin: it had seen frequentation and habitation from the Neolithic, and was again to be occupied in two post-Roman phases; there were, too, other areas of burial near by. The settlements, with a note on the leat serving Durnovaria which impinged on the excavated sites, are the subject of vol. I of the report by C. Sparey Green (No. 7 in the Dorset Society's Monograph series, 1987); and perhaps the most instructive overview of the vast palimpsest which all this activity has left behind is provided by the folding sheet of plans, figs 3 and 4, of that volume - the one showing all features, the other disentangling fourteen phases from Neolithic to modern times. The reader will find it necessary to have continual recourse to vol. I; quite why all material regarding the burials was not reserved for vol. II is unexplained. Fortunately, vol. I is offered by the Society as a pair with vol. II, at ?40. Vol. II is in four parts. (I) D.E. Farwell describes the cemeteries, with various scholars dealing with such grave-goods and other artefacts as there were; (2) T.I. Molleson contributes a magnificent study of the skeletal material and explores its implications; (3) Ann Woodward - her name should have been included as the third main author - sets the discoveries valuably in context, correcting where necessary, and supplementing, Green's essay in The Early Church in Western Britain &amp; Ireland (ed. S.M. Pearce, BAR IO2, 1982); and finally (4) there is Farwell's schedule of all the graves. The excavation was managed with zeal, insight, and expertise, and so was the preparation of the several sections. Both local or regional, and wider, requirements are amply satisfied by the text, and the first-class drawings and photographs printed in it; the microfiches keep in a decent editorial obscurity much that is justly so kept; but not always, and I shall have a word to say on this subject later. Proof-reading has been good, mistakes such as the 'discreetly excavated' character of Site C, and the mis-spelling of Roger Tomlin's name being mercifully few. However, by an oversight it was necessary to reprint on a loose 3-page folder five figs which should have been in red as well as black; and the very large (96 by 68 cm) folder, showing by a colour differentiation the incidence of the graves of men, women, and children, is printed on 'art' paper and folded into 16: it cannot possibly last in ordinary use. The main cemetery at Poundbury is the largest as yet excavated in Britain by modern methods. This report contains an immense mass of detail which it would be quite impossible to cover in a review of moderate length. Fortunately, an outline is generally known from previous publications, most notably Green's paper, already mentioned, in the Radford Festschrift of 1982. With four exceptions, the coins - by no means numerous - are Constantinian and Valentinianic; one of the Theodosian house occurred in the fallen plaster of the important, and it seems much-frequented, mausoleum (R8); of such masonry structures there were seven, and in addition three ditched (?hedged) plots on the outskirts. The alignment was west and east, with little exception; skeletal similarities suggest that even in the rows of graves, there were family groups. Most important, and strongly emphasized by Dorothy Watts in her penetrating</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 401 analysis of features indicative of Christian cemeteries, made available to Ann Woodward as a basis for her own study of the problem in these pages, but since published (Christians and Pagans in Roman Britain (I991), ch. 3), is the equal importance accorded at Poundbury to men, women, and children, as the Christian faith demanded. It is left to Molleson, nevertheless, to point out (212-13) something of an imbalance in what might be expected, by a modern yardstick (of 1841), in the relative numbers of neonates and infants, as if disproportionately few of the former were being admitted. Here, perhaps, we may discern the influence of infant-baptism, which, growing from the third century, was to be championed by St Augustine of Hippo in 413 (cf. W.H.C. Frend, The Rise of Christianity (1984), 695, n. 179), long after this cemetery was closed. The reviewer can only read with admiration Molleson's remarkable study of the skeletal material. One important matter, thoroughly discussed, concerns the difficulties of satisfactorily determining age; here Gy. Acsaidi and J. Nemeskeri's History of Human Life Span and Mortality (1970) provides a valuable parallel discussion (ch. 3), with its drawing of a distinction between chronological and biological age. But we split hairs. As was so pithily observed of the Trentholme Drive, York burials of similar age, 'our middle age was their elderly'. In Molleson's contribution will be found the most revealing data about food, and the curiously high rate of dental caries (the area being one deficient, it seems, in natural fluoride); and if there were few cases of rickets, there was a small indication of presumably bovine tuberculosis, which affects the bone. More curious still was the high rate of the ingestion of lead during life, which we should need to set against evidence of the same period from elsewhere to evaluate properly - something that should be done. As is pointed out, the use of lead vats or pans for the preparation or evaporation of drinks, and the use of pewter vessels, would have been largely responsible. Wood was more commonly used for water-pipes than lead; and in any case the Roman figure would not exceed the modern, if only lead pipes were to blame. Grave-goods were scanty, generally only a few small trinkets - beads, rings, bracelets placed with, rather than worn by, the deceased, a comb or two, a knife. Old habits died hard, however, and 13 out of 22 coins deposited as grave-goods had been placed in the mouth, and 44 burials revealed indications of footgear; there were even some pots. A cemetery area apparently acquired de novo and begun in an orderly fashion seems to point to a large group of citizens who had been converted to Christianity not long after the Peace of the Church; it is likely enough that old habits of providing for the journey to the afterlife were, however surreptitiously, preserved for some time. And perhaps not surreptitiously: the Water Newton Treasure, and even Thetford according to Dorothy Watts, mingle pagan and Christian notions. Among the objects there are three which require comment. The first is, of course, the celebrated inner lid-lining of a coffin in Grave 35o, a sheet of lead bearing a rude inscription from the sand-bed in which it had been cast, END NI, which has entered secondary literature as In Deo or In Nomine Domini. As Tomlin shows (RIB 11.3, 94 no. 2437.2, and here 132-3 with a photograph, pl. 22, p. 53), this cannot, alas, stand, and the letters must remain, at least for the present, undeciphered. That mode of inscribing a slab must surely have more to do with the production-side than with any final destination. Secondly, what was originally described by Green (Dorset Proc. ci (I98I), 134) as a Y-shaped iron fitting, found at the head end of a simple wooden coffin (Grave 1339), became, in his Radford Festschrift paper (p. 67), 'a crude anthropomorphic figure, or non-decorative symbol'; in Dorothy Watts's hands, however, (op. cit., 176-8) it reaches full status as an identifiable Christian symbol, in the form of a Y, with her usual learned apparatus. Alas! it is nothing of the sort: in Poundbury II (II8, fig. 83, 40) it takes its place as 'a decorative star-shaped plate with five arms' which, for all we know to the contrary, may have been devised to join the planks of the lid, or arrest the widening of a crack. There is a lesson here - or rather two - for the previous, misleading descriptions should have been noted. The third object was published in vol. I (fig. 70, 6; II, 99 no. 6) from a young woman's grave (no. 543). It is a figurine in wrought iron, II cm high, showing a nude male personage; clenched tangs under each foot show that it had been attached to some base, or large object, about I cm thick. Such things are very rare. Anne Ross, in a brief note concealed in the microfiche of vol. II, thinks sensibly enough of a smith-god, but clearly a more extensive study needs to be done, and its presence in the grave of a woman of ostensibly Christian character explained. We may note that both arms are broken, the left at the shoulder, where the careful drawing shows two chisel-like marks much resembling those on bronze figurines from the Thames on which Merrifield has commented (The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic (1987), 99, pl. 30). This would appear to have been similarly treated; but I have not seen the original. It is, perhaps, worth remark that a tiny male figure is incorporated into the name-stamp of the cutler Basilius (RIB II.3, no. 2428.6).</page><page sequence="3">402 REVIEWS I conclude with a strong protest at the total inadequacy of illustration to accompany Green's wholly admirable and learned discussion of the painted decoration - walls and ceiling - from the long- frequented cella memoriae known here as Mausoleum R8 (135-9). Apart from a page of plans (fig. 92) showing the disposition of the material within the 6.4 by 4.8 m badly-ruined building, the only illustrations provided are photographed from mounted pages in one of the microfiches, degraded in tonal value and absurdly small: this is a unique thing for Britain and, in one particular, for Roman painting generally. There should have been a full series of colour photographs, including the 'small Chi-Rho', with a water-colour restoration, or at least a black-and-white interpretation. There are, indeed, photographs and drawings, including a colour print, elsewhere (N. Davey and R. Ling, Wall-Painting in Roman Britain (1982), io6-ii, and pl. xl); but since Green is not wholly satisfied with Davey's restorations, that can only be counted as a stop-gap. The consensus of opinion is that the range of stately figures, brightly dressed and facing east, with a youth in a white tunic with clavi in front, is composed of mortals, lacking as they do the nimbus of sanctity or rank. They are reminiscent of the gaily-dressed notables who greeted St Germanus in 429 (Constantius, Vita Germani, 14 (Sources chr6tiennes 112 (1965), 118)). Whether they carried wands, is not stated: here at least three of them do so, and from their black colouring with a white line down their leading edges, we might almost suppose that polished ebony, glancing in the light from the east, was intended. The identity of the figures is very uncertain: there is no known comparison, and no suggestion, for example, that the members of a city ordo carried such wands, although I suppose the decurions may have done so when in office, like the consuls of old. The bouleuterion meeting represented on a bronze coin of Alexandria Troas struck under Gallus (A.D. 251-3) (BMC Troas, Aeolis, and Lesbos, 27, no. 145, pl. vi, 7) shows curiales with no sign of wands. On the whole the late Professor J.M.C. Toynbee's suggestion that ancestors are represented is still the most likely, though proof is to seek. From the reference by Green to traces of architectural detail on other fragments, one is led to wonder whether a Raising of Lazarus may not have been depicted here, on the lines, say, of the fine painting, with Lazarus' tomb shown as an aedicula, in Cubiculum C of the Via Latina catacomb in Rome (A. Ferrua, The Unknown Catacomb (I991), 90, fig. 67). Christ may have been identified by the Chi-Rho; but in the Via Latina scene the onlookers are by no means so individualized as here, and of course carry no wands. Speculation remains; but this brief consideration is enough to show that the report is indeed gravely wanting in point of illustrations of this painting. We are left in amazement that the decoration of the ceiling and walls of this familial tomb should have survived at all. Penarth 'GEORGE C. BOON</page></plain_text>
