Private collection. S ANFORD ROBINSON GIFFORD (1823-1880) was applying the finishing touches to A Twilight in the Catskills (Fig. 1) in his Tenth Street studio dur- ing the winter of 1860-1861 when a critic who saw it there pronounced it "one of the most original and admirable delineations of our scenery yet pro- duced."' When unveiled at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in March, the painting was declared the "largest and most impor- tant landscape in the Exhibition" and "the great picture of the season, the crowning glory of this exhibition."2 With its extended, horizontal format, measuring 27 by 54 inches, A Twilight in the Catskills is, indeed, one of Gifford's largest pic- tures.3 And because the work elevated Gifford to the uppermost rank of American painters, it can also be ADAM GREENHALGH is enrolled in the Ph.D. Program in the History of Art at Yale University.

A Twilight in the Catskills is a panoramic view taken from an elevated ledge looking out toward a distant mountain ridge. The sun has just dipped below the horizon, and the large expanse of sky is divided into broad horizontal bands of crimson and gold. Large, lifeless trees frame a purple-shadowed valley through which meanders a golden stream. A bear stands in the lee of a boulder alongside a watercourse that disappears over the precipice in the painting's foreground. The entire scene is suf- fused with the day's last light, the ember-like glow of the setting sun reflecting off trees, clouds, rocks, and water. The spectacular light and color of A Twilight in the Catskills caught the eye of many of the critics. "The brilliance of this picture almost fills the room, and we doubt if any one enters without his eyes being attracted involuntarily to the spot," remarked the writer for the New York Daily Tribune.6 Another The American Art Journal/Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 47</page><page sequence="4">?-' it 11 OR~I ....~/ I .?.. esk ld....;:. - .'7:: "t "7": I i /'/i ,-,- Fig. 4.

"His imagination seems more profound, his sentiment more enlarged," wrote the critic for the New York Express, "not so much grace as power is what we find in this work.""'2 Forced to speculate about the image and its meaning, twentieth-century scholars based their comments on the enthusiastic reception of the painting during the artist's lifetime. Until now there had been no opportunity to measure conjecture against visible facts. From 1881, when recorded in the catalogue of Gifford's work compiled shortly after his death, until 1998, when the canvas was brought to the Williamstown Art Conservation Cen- ter, the painting's whereabouts were unknown to scholars.'3 Confronted with the work itself, scholars can now assess A Twilight in the Catskills critically, and renewed consideration can be given to Gif- ford's motivation in creating-during the politically The American Art Journal / Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 49</page><page sequence="6">?~ .~v...~ .. ~1- -~s??:? .?~? . i ? ~? ~?? ?''tli-??~.r ? i ?f.' ?? ?~-?i3t eE ~ i. :?? c. ?,,?I- ~r :?~ sC ??-? : r I*, 'i ?~;~I?~I~~ ~~**C.'~.~* i.

A correspondent for the New York Daily Tribune described it as "one of the most powerful pictures which this artist has exhibited to the public.""' A short time later, the canvas was on display in the Fourth Annual Exhibi- tion at the Boston Athenaeum. A critic reviewing 50 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="7">the show for the New York Times wrote that Gifford had on view a "landscape, giving some grand old mountains by twilight" that would "long be remem- bered."'6 On Wednesday, March 20, the Thirty-sixth Annual Exhibition of the National Academy of Design opened its doors to the public, and it was there that the painting received its most widespread acclaim. ~ Nothing further is known of the painting's whereabouts until shortly after Gifford's death from malarial fever on August 29, 1880. From October of 1880 until March of the following year, the Met- ropolitan Museum of Art exhibited the "Memorial Collection of the Works of the Late Sanford R. Gif- ford," which was accompanied by a checklist com- piled by Waldo Selden Pratt (1857-1939), secretary of the Gifford Memorial Exhibition Committee.'" In the introduction to the checklist, John Ferguson Weir (1841-1926), then a professor at the Yale School of Fine Arts, lamented the omission of sev- eral of Gifford's "important pictures," among them A Twilight in the Catskills of 1861, because there had been little time to assemble the collection.19 A Metropolitan Museum label on the back of the painting's frame, however, indicates that A Twilight in the Catskills was transported to New York in time for the exhibition after all. In addition, the painting was included in the checklist as number 153, in the collection of J. B. Brown of Portland, Maine.20 In the checklist, however, it was mistak- enly entitled Twilight in the Wilderness, the title of Frederic E. Church's great picture (see Fig. 14), executed just one year before Gifford's monumen- tal twilight scene.21 Shortly after the close of the memorial exhibi- tion, the Metropolitan Museum published The Memorial Catalogue of the Paintings of Sanford Robinson Gifford, N.A., which included an inven- tory, also compiled by Pratt, of 739 of the artist's paintings, along with their dates and in many instances owners, as well as a biographical and crit- ical essay written by Weir.22 Number 235 in the Memorial Catalogue is Gifford's Twilight in the Catskills-Kauterskill Clove of 1861, listed as in the estate of J. B. Brown.23 The entry contains a cross-reference to number 153 in the exhibition checklist, thus confirming that both entries refer to the same painting.24 In titling the work for the Memorial Catalogue, Pratt may have taken into account Gifford's most recent reference to the painting-his 1874 list of "Chief Pictures"-where the artist recorded the image as Kauterskill Clove.25 As stated in the introductory note to the catalogue, "the title is usually that given by Mr. Gifford.""26 Pratt may also have been aware of the other titles by which the work had been known during Gifford's lifetime.27 A scene in the Catskills would have been a nat- ural choice for Gifford, who had spent much of his youth in Hudson, New York.28 Looking across the Hudson River from his parents' home, the artist could have seen the town of Catskill, where Thomas Cole (1801-1848), the single artist Gifford credited with inspiring him to pursue landscape painting, had his studio.29 Gifford never trained with Cole-he had, in fact, originally set out to be a portraitist. His devotion to the father of American landscape painting is clear, however, from his sketching and hiking activities of 1846. As he later recalled, "I made several pedestrian tours in the Catskill Mountains and the Berkshire Hills, and made a good many sketches from Nature. These studies, together with the great admiration I felt for the works of Cole ... opened my eyes to a keener perception and more intelligent enjoyment of Nature. ... From this time my direction in Art was determined."30 Gifford's earliest extant painting, Kauterskill Falls of 1846 (Fig. 2), is probably a result of one of these Cole-inspired rambles. Located deep in the Catskill Mountains, about twelve miles west of the Hudson River, the double- tiered Kauterskill Falls has an upper leap of almost 200 feet and a lower cascade of approximately 85 feet (Figs. 3-5)."' It is fed by Lake Creek, which runs southwest from South Lake. Below Kauters- kill Falls, the creek runs due south, making its way down a ravine that leads into Kauterskill Clove, one of the largest valleys in the Catskills. At the clove, Lake Creek joins Kauterskill Creek, which runs eastward from Haines Falls along the base of Kauterskill Clove until it eventually meets the Hud- son River. By the mid-nineteenth century, Kauterskill Falls was a mandatory destination on the American ver- sion of the Grand Tour.32 In his 1846 portrayal of the site, Gifford depicted the falls from the staircase leading to the base. The popularity and accessibil- ity of Gifford's view are affirmed by the plethora of stereoscopic views of the falls taken from that same vantage point (see Fig. 3). Peter Schutt, the owner of the land surrounding the falls in the early nine- teenth century, constructed an observation deck and The American Art Journal/Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 51</page><page sequence="8">low., FIV-P ...

Both are also visible in the later stereograph. By 1852, the popularity of the site encouraged Schutt to open Laurel House, which provided visi- tors with overnight accommodations.33 Because the watercourse was partially impeded by a sawmill upstream, the current could be dammed completely. Once a full sluice had accumulated, it could be released by Schutt, the "Neptune of the spot," for a fee, unleashing a spectacular torrent at the whim of the paying spectator.34 For thirsty visitors, chilled bottles of champagne could be lowered from the top of the falls in a basket.35 This domesticated and commercialized aspect of the wilderness is shown in Gifford's early depiction of the locale, but he 52 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="9">;.:* ?~ ~?

A Twilight in the Catskills is one of at least six major exhibition-sized works by Gifford that depict Kauterskill Clove, three of which appear on the artist's list of "Chief Pictures."36 These works, com- bined with a multitude of oil sketches and numer- ous pencil drawings, make the clove the most frequently represented of all of Gifford's subjects. Other works by the artist said to be of the Catskills, but not identified as to precise locale, may also be views of the clove.37 The region clearly held great appeal for Gifford. After the artist's death, Wor- thington Whittredge (1820-1910) spoke of the intense bond Gifford had with these mountains and valleys: "He loved them as he loved his mother, The American Art Journal/ Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 53</page><page sequence="10">?.; 14l~ ~9cl~:V CIFs i ~??,r~so?- ~ r~'PKw,$ ?rrfls; '" "- ~i'b ~ 4 ;1~~$? 4r ~%?s?~s: '3;?F~i,-x'4?: ~ 5~r; ibS Ar *1 A?

No autumn came that he did not visit them, and for a long period of his artistic life he went in summer to the Catskills as a boy goes to school.""38 The summer of 1860 was typical in this respect, and it was on this sketching expedition that Gifford, accompanied by artist friends Jervis McEntee (1828-1891) and Richard William Hubbard (1816-1888), recorded many of the features that would appear in A Twilight in the Catskills.39 A pair of pencil sketches on a single sheet of a view look- ing down the length of a valley in the Catskills- quite possibly Kauterskill Clove-seems to rehearse, if only in a general way, the painting's compositional design: the vista is framed on both sides by trees, there are rocks in the foreground, an expansive valley in the middle ground, and moun- tains on the horizon (Fig. 6). The painting's ele- vated vantage point follows that of the sketches.40 The ruled border, the presence of human figures, and the greater attention to topography and geol- ogy in the larger drawing suggest that it is the later of the two. In it, the relaxed figures, the foliage arching over the center of the composition, along The American Art Journal / Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 55</page><page sequence="12">;r0;1 I -W ?13 nzi- Fig. 11.

The following winter, however, when working in his New York studio, Gifford eschewed many of the details he recorded in the larger sketch and instead relied more closely, it would seem, on the smaller, less developed drawing for the final painting. Returning in 1860 to the site of his earliest known painting of Kauterskill Falls, Gifford made a thumbnail sketch of the cascade from within the cavern behind the upper leap (Fig. 7), a vantage point very similar to that employed by Thomas Cole 56 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="13">A -A S.A ~?:~: -i?lr~. ?u~lC;AL V~~I~ j.ni~~ ilb, crlri~d~iA "ll Am L: 51.6E~t~~~i~~~ 4-4- -'a 3-W If.4E ~i~j~i B'P.

(Fig. 8) and William Guy Wall (1792-after 1864) decades earlier.4' All three artists successfully con- veyed the velocity with which the water plummets earthward and the dramatic impact with which it strikes the rocky pool beneath. In addition to ren- dering the spectacular upper leap of Kauterskill Falls, Gifford recorded the brink of the lower leap, where the water pools before making its second earthbound descent. This image, of a watercourse disappearing over a precipice, commanded much of the artist's attention that summer. Five additional drawings in Gifford's 1860 sketchbook are devoted to such a motif. The others depict the brink of Haines Falls (Fig. 9), over which Kauterskill Creek The American Art Journal / Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 57</page><page sequence="14">cascades at the western end of the clove (Fig. 10). Beyond the precipice of Haines Falls, Gifford's sketches show the shoulder of South Mountain and a glimpse of the Hudson Valley in the distance. Although Gifford sketched at both Haines Falls and Kauterskill Falls during the summer of 1860, it is the latter site that appears to have served as the inspiration for A Twilight in the Catskills. A com- parison of Gifford's painting with the actual rock formations at Kauterskill Falls, as seen in a roughly contemporaneous stereoscopic view (see Fig. 5), indicates that, while the rocky forms shown in the painting may not be a completely faithful geologic document, they certainly resemble those found at Kauterskill Falls, particularly at the lower leap. Comparable formations are also depicted in Gif- ford's 1860 sketch of the site (see Fig. 7). By con- trast, the rocks found at Haines Falls (see Fig. 10) are not at all like those depicted in Gifford's paint- ing. Furthermore, the rocky forms appearing along- side the watercourse in Gifford's painting resemble those seen in Cole's From the Top of Kaaterskill Falls (Fig. 11). While the foreground of A Twilight in the Catskills may take its inspiration from the brink of Kauterskill Falls, the wide-open panorama occupy- ing the middle and background of the painting does not portray the actual view from the falls. Nor is it the prospect from Haines Falls. Gifford's sketches of the Hudson Valley from the brink of Haines Falls depict a series of overlapping mountain ridges (see Fig. 9). Gifford's drawing from behind the upper leap of Kauterskill Falls (see Fig. 7) offers an even less expansive view of the valley. Cole's From the Top of Kaaterskill Falls depicts a similarly occluded foreground and middle ground. When composing the panoramic view seen in A Twilight in the Catskills, Gifford did not remain faithful to the topo- graphical facts of either prospect. His initial source of inspiration appears to be another drawing in his 1860 sketchbook: a sheet inscribed "Kauterskill Clove July 31st" (Fig. 12). Taken from the southern wall of the clove, possibly from Poet's Ledge, just east of Hillyer Ravine (see Fig. 4), the sketch shows the western terminus of the clove. The area promi- nently in shadow at the center of A Twilight in the Catskills is similarly depicted in the sketch. The drawing shows Kauterskill Creek meandering along the base of the clove, just as it does in the painting. Also delineated in the sketch are the mountains on the horizon: from left to right, Sugarloaf Mountain, Hunter Mountain, and the double-peaked Onteora Mountain, their profiles corresponding to those depicted in A Twilight in the Catskills.42 When composing A Twilight in the Catskills, Gifford clearly took liberties with the geography and topography of the clove. He broadened the val- ley considerably, thereby minimizing the claustro- phobic effect of its encroaching side walls. He also positioned the western terminus of the clove so as to align it with the setting sun. And, as mentioned pre- viously, he did not depict an actual view from Kauterskill Falls. Gifford had employed such work- ing methods before. In The Wilderness of 1860 (Fig. 13), for example, one of his most ambitious renderings of American scenery prior to A Twilight in the Catskills, Gifford conflated the monumental form of Mount Katahdin in Maine with scenery from Nova Scotia and New Hampshire. He appears to have rearranged the landscape of the far North for expressive means, to create an appropriate set- ting, a "forest primeval" as he called it,43 for native peoples (Gifford subtitled the painting Home of the Red Brow'd Hunter Race).44 In A Lake Twilight (pri- vate collection), executed the same year as A Twi- light in the Catskills, Gifford altered the lighting for expressive purposes, depicting a view of Camel's Hump in Vermont that is incompatible with the twi- light filling Gifford's sky.45 In reconfiguring the scenery in and near Kauterskill Clove for A Twilight in the Catskills, Gifford may have been referring to his own fondness for the place. It is also possible that he was calling attention to the wider cultural connotations of this popular artistic and tourist site. Because of its tremendous vertical drop, menac- ing geology, and energetic cascade, Kauterskill Falls was frequently described in the histrionic language of the sublime.46 Numerous nineteenth-century writ- ers and artists commented on the incredible specta- cle, using hyperbolic language to invoke the fear of God or of Hades. Standing on the brink of the falls in the early years of the century, Timothy Dwight (1752-1817), the president of Yale University, for example, declared the dark and narrow crevice below "as it were, a solitary bye-path to the nether world."47 A decade or so later the poet Grenville Mellen (1799-1841) described the cavern behind the upper cascade as a "theatre for people to stand in, and behold the prodigies and fearful wonders of the Almighty; and feel their own insignificance."48 The implications of the water cascading off the precipice are clear. Yet aside from a few reflections 58 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="15">".'.'Y R?

Scott. close to the brink, the raucous, aqueous energies that captured the attention of so many commenta- tors are not manifest in Gifford's painting. As one writer aptly observed, "The foreground is filled with barren rocks and a quiet streamlet that pauses before it takes a final leap to meet its dazzling neighbor below.""49 In other words, Gifford's paint- ing is infused, not with the energetic crashing of a Colesian waterfall, but with an aura of silence before the deafening roar of the water plunging earthward. With neither a human figure with whom to iden- tify nor a place in the barren and rocky foreground from which safely to survey the scene below, the viewer is drawn into the passage of the water over the precipice. The black bear, the only living being in the painting, serves to reinforce this focus.

An image of impending peril is highly appropri- ate to the nation in the months of late 1860 and early 1861. It was then quickly becoming apparent that the United States would soon be facing its most trying test of national solidarity. Long before Con- federate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, the country had been rent asunder, both politically and emotionally. On June 16, 1858, Abraham Lincoln, speaking before the Illinois Republican Conven- tion, had declared, "A house divided cannot stand. I believe government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free."'' In December of 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede; in just two 60 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="17">?,,~ --. .r: ?~? - r. .... i " ....

The New York newspapers termed the events leading up to the for- mation on February 9, 1861, of the Confederate States of America, "The National Crisis."52 The New York Daily Tribune pronounced the imminent cata- strophe "The Meteor of War."53 Declaring the events the "Greatest Struggle of History," the New York Times went on to prognosticate that "If we indeed are not as yet in the very melee of the fight, we are nevertheless in the most thrillingly anxious moment. The trumpets of the heralds have sounded-the spectators lean over the barrier-the lancers are in rest-some have splintered-a thou- sand years hence it will all live in legend, in chron- icle, in picture and in song."54 Painted on the eve of the outbreak of the Civil War, Gifford's image of a landscape cast in twilight undoubtedly places it in the typology of metaphoric Civil War paintings, alongside, for example, Church's Twilight in the Wilderness (Fig. 14) and Our Banner in the Sky (Fig. 15), two archetypal patriotic sky pictures painted, respectively, just one year before and several months after Gifford's A The American Art Journal /Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 61</page><page sequence="18">? iL.:.. .

Oil on canvas, 8 1/4 x 12 1/4". Collection, Olana State Historic Site, New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation. Twilight in the Catskills. Church's Twilight in the Wilderness is widely acknowledged as symbolizing the end of tranquility and peace, and Our Banner in the Sky as representing the moment when the nation awakens to a day of violent conflict.55 Surely Gif- ford saw Church's Twilight in the Wilderness when it was displayed at Goupil's in June and July of 1860.56 He must have known the study for it as well; Twilight, a Sketch (Fig. 16) was included in an 1859 exhibition at the National Academy of Design to which Gifford had contributed seven paintings of his own.7" The similarities between Gifford's A Twilight in the Catskills and Church's Twilight in the Wilder- ness and Twilight, a Sketch are striking. All three paintings portray dark, shadowy landscapes, with landforms and trees cast almost in silhouette. In all three canvases, the focus is on the conflagration in 62 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="19">the sky. The palettes are also remarkably alike: in each the upper stratum of sky is painted in deep crimson, hovering above a thin band of gold that marks the last fiery radiation of the setting sun. Critics faulted the lower clouds in Church's study for their "flamboyant design" and "eccentric chaos."58 Although not nearly as bombastic as Church's, the sky in Gifford's painting reminded one critic of "some earlier works by Church, in which the same general effect was represented.""59 Another viewer found the "brilliant, gorgeous effect of light" in Gifford's painting "really marvelous- far exceeding ... its kindred effect in Church's Twi- light in the Wilderness."60 Rather than convey a sense of turbulence, as Church did in Twilight in the Wilderness and its study, Gifford instead chose to portray the solemn and the imminent. For this he looked not to the spectacular twilight incandescence of the sky but rather to its afterglow, the moment after the sun has dipped below the horizon and prior to the replace- ment of solar irradiation with a blanket of darkness. A number of critics commented on the effulgence of the sun's fiery descent and the heavy gloom settling in to replace it. "Mr. Gifford has imbued the very atmosphere with a sense of coming darkness, how cunningly he has taught Light to counterfeit a gloom," observed the correspondent for the Albion.61 The writer for the Tribune noted: "While, in the foreground, the jutting points of rock and hillock catch a touch of flame from the reflection of the western light, the intervening valleys are sink- ing into the deep shadow of the coming darkness, though lit up nevertheless to a sort of 'darkness vis- ible' by an atmosphere so full of warmth and bril- liancy."62 Taken from the opening stanzas of Milton's Paradise Lost, the mention of darkness visible refers to the moment when Satan and his rebellious companions, having been cast from Heaven, survey the scene of their imprisonment: The dismal Situation waste and wilde; A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round; As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames; No light, but rather darkness visible; Serv'd only to discover sights of woe; Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace; And rest can never dwell, hope never comes; That comes to all; but torture without end; Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed; With ever-burning Sulphur Unconsum' d.63 As in Paradise Lost, the brilliant light and encroaching darkness in Gifford's painting may be seen as prefiguring a fall from grace, compounded by the precipitous vantage point from which the coming darkness is viewed.64 Iconographically, Gifford's A Twilight in the Catskills has many similarities to Church's Our Banner in the Sky, albeit with much less literal sym- bolism. When Church finished the small oil sketch for Our Banner in the Sky, it was acquired by Goupil and Company, to be made into a chro- molithograph.65 Referring directly to the bombard- ment of Fort Sumter on April 12, the action that prompted the remaining Southern states to secede from the Union on April 17 and hence the final act that precipitated the outright declaration of war, Our Banner in the Sky features a fragmented yet readily recognizable American flag.66 This tattered celestial standard, supported by a branchless tree above which an eagle soars, was offered as a sym- bolic reminder that the nation was no longer whole. In Our Banner in the Sky, the foreground, eagle, tree, and landscape are cast in shadow and seen in silhouette. As in Gifford's A Twilight in the Catskills, attention is riveted on the sky. The tall, lifeless trees act as oversized flagpoles seemingly supporting the banner of crimson sky above. In A Twilight in the Catskills, Gifford eliminated the human presence altogether. He chose to depict a nearly barren foreground as well. All that can be seen are a few boulders and the remains of once-liv- ing trees. In nineteenth-century America, trees were often described in anthropomorphic terms;67 the tree was even utilized as a metaphor for the structure and hierarchy of American society. Indeed, as Har- land Coultas remarked in 1858, "the truth is, that society in America resembles a widespread and well-developed tree, where a great many branches make an equally powerful growth on all sides."68 Not only are Gifford's trees quite dead, but their branches have dropped from their trunks as well. Bearing in mind Coultas's metaphor of a broad- branched tree for a thriving American society, the trees in Gifford's painting may be seen as represen- tative of a politically and emotionally divided nation. As early as January of 1861, the Southern rebel- lion was conceived of as a "disease" capable of extinguishing the Union. The New York Daily Tri- bune asked, "Shall . . . our Constitution [be] destroyed by treachery and force?-the city of Washington seized and plundered by a lawless mob?-the Federal Congress dispersed, never The American Art Journal /Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 63</page><page sequence="20">.

Unremittingly foreboding, it is without any feature in which optimism or solace might be found; thus, unlike Church's empyrean conflagration in Our Banner in the Sky, Gifford's painting has no divine sign of the preordained positive outcome of the impending crisis. Quick to enlist for service when war broke out, joining the Eighth Company of the Seventh Regi- ment of the New York National Guard in April of 64 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="21">1861, Gifford was one of only a few artists actively to participate in the war effort.70 Later, Gifford was taciturn about his motivation for enlisting, but more than one obituary cited his strong patriotic senti- ments. The Reverend Dr. Bellows, who officiated at the artist's funeral, remarked that "patriotism, in the speaker's opinion, was at one time a greater force in Gifford's life than even love of Art: and his resolve to fight as a private soldier in the late war for the Union was greater in its influence upon the man, and in its possession of him, than even his devotion to his profession.""71 Gifford would reprise the symbolic vocabulary of A Twilight in the Catskills in Baltimore, 1862-- Twilight (Fig. 17), his most explicit treatment of a Civil War subject known to date.72 The work was executed shortly after the artist's second term in New York's Seventh Regiment. A study for the can- vas (unlocated) was on display in his studio for some years. According to Henry Tuckerman, it served to remind Gifford's artist friends "of the patriotism he repeatedly exhibited as a member of the Seventh Regiment of New York."731 Recalling the heavy, glowering sky of A Twilight in the Catskills, Baltimore, 1862-Twilight is divided into distinct bands that silhouette the escarpment, cannon, and soldier who dwarf the city skyline beyond. The large, dead trees in the 1861 painting are revived in the exaggerated bayonet of what one critic described as the "preternaturally tall" sentinel, who looks out from the silhouetted battlement.74 Although the setting of each painting is identified in the title, their panoramic formats suggest a location that cannot be confined within the picture frame. Neither A Twilight in the Catskills nor Baltimore, 1862-Twilight portrays a specific locale; rather, in treating the local, the personal, and the specific, each addresses themes of a broader, national scope.75 The Seventh Regiment had been assembled in response to Lincoln's call for militia forces to sup- press the uprising of the recently seceded Southern states as well as to defend Washington, which, only a thousand feet from the secession-sympathetic state of Virginia, was the main prize to be won by the South. Maryland, especially the city of Balti- more, was also in need of reinforcement. The state was rife with secessionist sentiment, despite having a pro-Union governor, Thomas H. Hicks. If Mary- land were to fall to Southern forces, Washington would be surrounded, cut off, and surely taken by the Confederacy. The Seventh Regiment's defense of Baltimore served the dual purpose of preventing potential secessionist insurrection in that city and reinforcing the border states and offering protective cover for the capital city.76 Following A Twilight in the Catksills, when Gif- ford next portrayed Kauterskill Clove, he did so through a remarkably different lens. Eschewing Civil War iconography altogether, Gifford adopted, as he would later describe it, an "unwarlike" mode of painting.77 While stationed in Fort Federal Hill in July of 1862, Gifford had longed to escape from military life to his beloved Catskills. "I think often of my ... studio," he wrote, "of the green fields, and the grand mountains, where, but for these unhappy times, I would now be sitting on a camp stool under a peaceful umbrella."78 Gifford's Kauterskill Clove of 1862 (Fig. 18) seems to express the artist's fulfillment of his Catskill reverie, his dream to be back in the idyllic sur- roundings of his spiritual landscape. It was this image of the clove that Gifford would portray repeatedly in later years. So far as is known, he never again attempted anything resembling the dramatic panorama of A Twilight in the Catskills. In all his later paintings of Kauterskill Clove, the artist employed a vertical format and cast the scenery in the hazy, golden light of Indian summer. In addition to Kauterskill Clove of 1862 (see Fig. 18), Gifford executed another full-size version the following year (unlocated),79 a smaller canvas in 1871 (Fig. 19), and two large-scale views in 1880 (Fig. 20 and private collection),80 these last produced just weeks prior to his death.8' No trace of the desolate, foreboding vision of 1861 remains in these later interpretations of the locale. Writing about Gifford's working methods in 1877, the critic George Sheldon described A Twi- light in the Catskills as "a twilight scene, dark-pur- ple toned, lowering, strange, almost awful, altogether striking and effective."82 Sheldon, who knew Gifford well, attributed the painting's excep- tional iconography to the artist's desire to refute claims that he was capable of producing only "Indian-summer" landscapes. Yet the critic's own description of the painting and the impact it had on viewers in 1861 indicates the work succeeded in ways that went beyond any formal considerations that may have prompted Gifford to execute it: "The persons who thought they had his measure did not know what to say.

It was a day of triumph for the painter, and of instruction for his admirers.""83 A Twilight in the Catskills stands as one of Gif- ford's most striking pictures. While formal con- cerns may have played a role in its conception, as Sheldon later proposed, the painting is truly anom- alous in Gifford's oeuvre, even when compared with the artist's other twilight paintings of the same decade.

That the article "A" was included in the title when it was unveiled at the National Academy of Design would suggest a tem- porally specific reading of the image. A Twilight in the Catskills does not merely pay homage to the spectacular atmospheric effects for which the Catskill region is renowned or simply demonstrate Gifford's ability to render such irruptive spectacles. Rather, it is a powerful portrait of a particular metaphorical twilight-that is, as Sheldon remarked, the "lowering,... almost awful" portent of imminent darkness mirroring the mood of the Northern United States as it paused on the brink of national crisis in the early months of 1861 before plunging into war. The preliminary research for this article was conducted dur- ing the 1999-2000 academic year while the author was the Judith M. Lenett Fellow in the Williams College Graduate Pro- gram in the History of Art. Offered in collaboration with the Williamstown Art Conservation Center and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, the fellowship supports study of a single art object from both art-historical and art-conservation perspectives. The author's initial findings on the painting were presented in a lecture given at the Clark Art Institute on May 5, 2000. For assistance with this project, the author would like to thank Mark Haxthausen, Director of the Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art, and Thomas J. Branchick, Director of the Williamstown Art Conservation Center. The entire staff of the Williamstown Art Conservation Center was enormously helpful with the physical examination, conservation treatment, and art-historical investigation of the painting. The author is also grateful to Sanford Gifford, a great- grandnephew of the artist, for permission to examine the Gif- ford material in his collection. The author would like to thank Kevin J. Avery, Associate Curator, American Paintings and Sculpture, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Michael J. Lewis, Associate Professor of Art, Williams College, for dis- cussing Gifford's A Twilight in the Catskills with him and con- tributing insights. For comments on an early version of the manuscript, the author would to thank Brian T. Allen, Curator of American Painting at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, and Marc Simpson, Associate Director, Williams Col- lege Graduate Program in the History of Art. The author is also thankful to Franklin Kelly, Curator of American and British Paintings, National Gallery of Art, for his comments on the manuscript and for sharing his expertise on other matters relat- ing to this project. 1.

Although the author of the article refers to the painting as "Clove of the Kauterskill, Sunset," the writer is clearly describing A Twilight in the Catskills. In the article, the scene is characterized as "taken from an elevation looking up a gorge-like valley through which flows a mountain stream; the time is just after sunset." According to a notice published in the New York Daily Tri- bune, the painting was completed by mid-January of 1861. On January 19, the newspaper reported that Gifford had recently finished a landscape "painted from a study made in the Catskills, and represent[ing] a Summer twilight." See "Art Items," New York Daily Tribune, January 19, 1861, p. 5, col. 1. The author would like to thank Merl M. Moore, Jr., for bring- ing this notice to his attention. 2.

A Twilight in the Catskills is the title under which the painting was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1861 and the one used most frequently in art-historical literature. On variant titles for the painting, see notes 1, 5, and 27. 3. Prior to 1861, the only larger works Gifford is known to have painted are Mansfield Mountain, 30 x 60 inches (1858; Manoogian Collection); Lake Nemi, 40 x 60 inches (1859; The American Art Journal / Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 69</page><page sequence="26">Toledo Museum of Art); A September Afternoon on the Chenango, 30 x 54 inches (1859; unlocated); and The Wilder- ness, 30 x 54 5/16 inches (1860; see Fig. 13). A September Afternoon on the Chenango is cited in A Memorial Catalogue of the Paintings of Sanford R. Gifford, N.A. (New York, 1881), no. 181. 4. One critic pronounced it "one of the most remarkable pic- tures of the day, [that] will add a sudden and substantial luster to a name which is already of brilliant repute in the world of art"; see "Great Picture of the Season." The Tribune's corre- spondent commented, "such a picture will add much to the rep- utation of the artist"; "National Academy Exhibition," New York Daily Tribune, March 27, 1861, p. 8, col. 2, quoted in Ila Weiss, Poetic Landscape: The Art and Experience of Sanford R. Gifford (Newark, Del., 1987), p. 229. The writer for the New York Commercial Advertiser went so far as to say that "in this picture, Mr. Gifford rose so high as to demonstrate that as a landscape colorist, his rank was first"; "Our Artists," New York Commercial Advertiser, October 17, 1861 (clipping in the Gif- ford Papers, reel D33, frame 133). 5. In response to a request for biographical information from Octavius Brooks Frothingham, a clergyman who also wrote on art topics for the New York Daily Tribune, Gifford compiled a "List of Some of My Chief Pictures" in 1874. Gifford placed forty-nine paintings, just over five percent of his work, on the list. The paintings are cited in chronological sequence, with A Twilight in the Catskills appearing fourth. Gifford sent the list to Frothingham with a letter written November 6, 1874, in Hudson, New York. An autograph version of Gifford's letter is in the Gifford Papers, reel D10, frames 1220-1222; it was for- merly owned by Edith Wilkinson, a niece of Gifford's. A com- posite of this version and another version of the letter in Gifford's hand, now unlocated, appears in Weiss, Poetic Land- scape, pp. 46-47. A typescript of the letter is in the collection of Sanford Gifford. The original list Gifford sent Frothingham is currently unlo- cated. A transcription of it, with annotations, appears in Weiss, Poetic Landscape, pp. 327-330. There exists also a typescript in the collection of Sanford Gifford. The titles of the paintings vary slightly in each version. In the transcription, the painting is cited as Kauterskill Clove, Twilight. In the typescript, it is simply recorded as Kauterskill Clove. "Mr. Brown" of Port- land, Maine, is given as the owner in both versions of the list. 6.

Brown, Portland, Me." After John Bundy Brown, the next known owner of the painting is Sally Carroll Brown Payson, a daughter of John Bundy's son John Marshall and the wife of Herbert Payson. The canvas descended from her to Charles Shipman Payson and his wife, Joan Whitney Payson. In 1998, the current owners discovered the work in the former Maine residence of Charles Shipman Payson. The work seems to have been exhibited only once after the 1880-1881 Gifford memorial show, in the "Memorial Exhibi- tion: J. B. Brown," sponsored by the Portland Society of Art and held at the L. D. M. Sweat Memorial Art Museum in Port- land in 1923. According to the catalogue for the show, Mrs. Herbert Payson lent a work by Gifford entitled Afterglow, which in all likelihood is A Twilight in the Catskills. See Memo- rial Exhibition: J. B. Brown, exhibition catalogue (Portland, Maine, 1923), no. 11. A label on the verso of the painting's frame bearing Mrs. Herbert Payson's name was probably placed there in connection with the loan of the work to this exhibition. The author would like to thank Joanne Payson for kindly providing information on the exhibition history and provenance of the painting and Earle Shettleworth, Jr., Director of the Maine Historic Preservation Commission, Augusta, for sharing his research on John Bundy Brown's art collection. 24. The Memorial Catalogue also has an entry (no. 234) for a now-lost oil study entitled Twilight in the Catskills, dated 1861, measuring 10 x 20 inches, and in the collection of Alfred Van Santvoord. In that entry is a cross-reference to no. 61 in the checklist of the Gifford Memorial Exhibition, which reads, "Twilight in the Wilderness [sic], 1861, A. Van Santvoord," and which contains a parenthetical reference to the entry for the large-scale picture in the same checklist ("see no. 153"), confirming that it is, in fact, a preparatory study for the exhibi- tion-sized picture. 25. See note 5. 26. Memorial Catalogue, p. 3. 27. Such titles include Clove of the Kauterskill, Sunset (see note 1); A Twilight in the Catskills (National Academy of Design, 1861); Kauterskill Clove; and Kauterskill Clove, Twi- light (Gifford's list of "Chief Pictures," 1874; see note 5). 28.

Variant spellings for the name of the falls include Kaaters- kill, Cauterskill, and Katterskill. Although Kaaterskill appears frequently on modern survey maps, Kauterskill is the spelling Gifford used in most of his correspondence, on his sketchbook drawings, and in the titles of his paintings. 32.

Five of these works were identified by Kevin Avery in his entry on Gifford's Kauterskill Clove (1862; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; see Fig. 18) in American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School, exhibition catalogue, The Metro- politan Museum of Art (New York, 1987), pp. 222-224. The paintings, as listed in the Memorial Catalogue, are Kauterskill Clove, no. 28 (1850; unlocated); A Twilight in the Catskills- Kauterskill Clove, no. 235 (1861; see Fig. 1); Kauterskill Falls, no. 276 (1862; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; see Fig. 18); Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills, no. 282 (1863; unlocated); and October in the Catskills, no. 719 (1880; October in the Catskills in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art [see Fig. 20] or a canvas by the same title in a private collection [see note 80].

Their two-month excursion began in July and took them from Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, to Kauterskill Clove. See the Crayon, vol. 7 (July, 1860), p. 205. This itinerary is based on dates and inscriptions in Gifford's sketchbooks from that summer (Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts). Gifford made numerous sketches from nature. From these drawings he would often make preparatory oil sketches for large-scale paintings. See George William Sheldon, "How One Landscape Painter Paints," Art Journal, vol. 3 (1877), pp. 284-285. Much of this is reiterated in Sheldon's American Painters (New York, 1878; enlarged ed., 1881; reprint ed., 1972), pp. 14-20. Sheldon's description is also corroborated by Whittredge in his "Memorial Address," p. 45. 40. In connection with research for this article, the author has visited Kauterskill Clove on several occasions. Although the drawing illustrated in Figure 6 appears to record the length of Kauterskill Clove as seen from one of the rocky outcroppings along the southern wall, the exact vantage point has not been determined. The painting, however, is not The American Art Journal/Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 71</page><page sequence="28">simply an elaboration of the sketch. At no point at this eleva- tion along the southern wall of the clove does there appear to be a waterfall that affords a view west. The author would like to thank Peter Kick, author of the forthcoming Catskill Moun- tain Guide, and Justine Hommel, President of the Mountain Top Historical Society, Haines Falls, New York, for helping to identify various topographical features in the Kauterskill Clove region. 41. Most nineteenth-century depictions of the falls show the cascade's impressive double-tiered descent from beneath the lower leap. The best known is probably Thomas Cole's Falls of the Kaaterskill (1826; Warner Collection of Gulf States Paper Corporation, Tuscaloosa, Alabama). On Cole's Kaaterskill Falls (see Fig. 8), see Elizabeth Mankin Kornhauser, American Paintings before 1945 in the Wadsworth Atheneum (New Haven, 1996), vol. 1, pp. 220-223, pl. 30. On Wall's Cauters- kill Falls on the Catskill Mountains, Taken from under the Cavern (1826; Honolulu Academy of Arts), see John Howat, "A Picturesque Site in the Catskills: The Kaaterskill Falls as Painted by William Guy Wall," Honolulu Academy of Arts Journal, vol. 1 (1974), pp. 17-30. 42. That Gifford recorded the mountains faithfully is demon- strated by a stereoscopic view of a party of sightseers in the clove taken between 1861 and 1865 in which the same moun- tainous silhouettes are visible in the background. These adven- turous tourists stand at Sunset Rock located on the north wall of the clove. See the view inscribed on verso "Catskill Mts" (1858?-1880?) in Stereoscopic Views of the Catskill Moun- tains in the Robert Dennis Collection of Stereoscopic Views, Miriam and Ira D.

James Fenimore Cooper's description of the falls is perhaps the best known, appearing in guidebooks and gift books and on postcards and stereographs. It reads in part: "The water comes crooking and winding among the rocks, first so slow that a trout could swim in it, and then starting and running like a cre- ater [creature] that wanted to make a far spring, till it gets to where the mountain divides, like the cleft hoof of a deer, leav- ing a deep hollow for the brook to tumble into the first pitch is nigh two hundred feet, and the water looks like flakes of driven snow, afore it touches the bottom." James Fenimore Cooper, The Pioneers; or, the Sources of the Susquehanna: A Descrip- tive Tale (1823; reprint ed., Albany, 1980), p. 193. Thomas Cole, who found the semicircular cavemrn beneath the first leap to be "the most remarkable feature of the scene," also paid particular attention to the precipice "over which the cataract shoots." "It is a singular, a wonderful scene," Cole wrote of the falls, "whether viewed from above, where the stream leaps into the tremendous gulf scooped into the very heart of the huge mountain, or as seen from below the second fall; ... the sound of the water, now falling upon the ear in a loud roar, and now in fitful lower tones; the lovely voice, the solitary song of the valley." Cole, writing in 1843, quoted in Rev. Charles Rockwell, The Catskill Mountains and Region Around (New York, 1867); cited in Howat, "A Picturesque Site in the Catskills," p. 23. 47.

One late nineteenth-century landscape theorist regarded the lone wild animal in art as a symbol of the "absence of man ... and the air of loneliness." See William McKendree Bryant, Philosophy of Landscape Painting (Saint Louis, 1882), p. 161; quoted in James Collins Moore, "The Storm and the Harvest: The Image of Nature in Mid-Nineteenth Century American Landscape Painting," Ph.D. diss., Indiana University, 1974, p. 132. Gifford's use of the motif also serves to enhance the feel- ing of desolation in the painting. 51. Quoted in Abraham Lincoln's "House Divided" Address (Springfield, Ill., 1958), p. 3. 52.

A writer for the New York Express also commented on these effects: "The strong contrasts are daring but successful; the broad, golden effulgence that lingers after the sun has set, is admirably depicted, while the depth of the shadows that obscures the mountain sides and the recesses of the valleys alike, is a darkness that, as in nature, is penetrable." The same critic also went on to declare that A Twilight in the Catskills "is no maudlin sympathy, no sickly sentimentalism; but a real appreciation of nature in her calmer moods and her profounder influences, that is as remarkable as if the work of art were a poem." "Art," New York Express, April 3, 1861. A Harper's Weekly correspondent noted that the "luminous sunset sky" was "contrasted with a bank of gloomy cloud. ... This peculiar but not unusual effect is painted with a great deal of richness and power." "The Lounger," Harper's Weekly, April 6, 1861. 63. John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book 1, line 63. That the critic for the Tribune evoked the seventeenth-century English poet is not surprising. Milton was widely read by nineteenth-century Americans and was especially popular with Hudson River School artists. Both Cole and Church, for example, based sev- eral paintings on his writings. Gifford surely would have known the poet's work as well. While at Brown University in the early 1840s, Gifford was a member of the Philermenian Society, a literary and debating club. And during his travels around Italy in 1856, he spent a night in the monastery of Val- lombrosa, made famous in Milton's Paradise Lost. See Weiss, Poetic Landscape, pp. 54, 75. In one of Gifford's obituary notices it is said the he "read the best poetry." See "Sanford R. Gifford," Art Journal, vol. 6 (1880), p. 319. For further discussion of the interest in Milton among early and mid-nineteenth-century American artists and writers, see Franklin Kelly, "Visions of New England," in Franklin Kelly and Gerald L. Carr, The Early Landscapes of Frederic Edwin Church, 1845-1854 (Fort Worth, Texas, 1987), pp. 55-57. 64. It has been suggested that in Twilight "Short Arbiter 'Twixt Day and Night" (1850; The Newark Museum, Newark, New Jersey), which takes its title from the opening lines of Book 9 of Paradise Lost, Church may have been expressing "his own awareness of the potential for an American fall." See Kelly, Church, pp. 28, 33. William Gerdts first noted the source for the title of Church's painting; see William H. Gerdts, "Early American Paintings from the Newark Museum," in Aspects of a Collection: Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century American Painting from the Newark Museum, exhibition catalogue, M. Knoedler and Company (New York, 1977), p. 9. 65. On August 18, 1861, the New York Daily Tribune reported that Goupil had purchased the copyright for Church's sketch. See Burke, "Banner of Dawn," p. 39. 66. Gifford could not have seen Our Banner in the Sky prior to executing A Twilight in the Catskills. As mentioned earlier, Gif- ford had completed his painting by mid-January of 1861, and the earliest evidence of Church working on Our Banner in the Sky is a notice published in the New York Daily Tribune on May 19. It is possible, however, that the two artists discussed poli- tics and the state of national affairs together from time to time. Since 1858, both had been living and working one floor apart in the Tenth Street Studio Building. 67. "Trees," Thomas Cole philosophized, "are like men, differ- ing widely in character. . . . In exposed situations, wild and uncultivated, battling with the elements and with one another for the possession of a morsel of soil, or a favoring rock to which they may cling, they exhibit striking peculiarities, and sometimes grand originality." Thomas Cole, "Essay on Ameri- can Scenery," American Monthly Magazine, n.s., vol. 1 (Janu- ary, 1836), p. 11, quoted in its entirety in The Natural Paradise: Painting in America, 1800-1950, exhibition catalogue, The Museum of Modem Art (New York, 1976), p. 90; an excerpt appears in Kelly, Church, p. 116. 68. Harland Coultas, What May Be Learned from a Tree (New York, 1860; reprinted 1863), p. 82. Although not published until 1860, Coultas's book was written in 1858. His recom- mendation that one look to trees for instruction was timely. "Human nature is not to be trusted with irresponsible power, no matter what the plea. . . . The encroachment of monopoly, whether political, religious, or commercial, must therefore be withstood. The tree must be made to spread out on all sides." Coultas, What May Be Learned from a Tree, p. 84. Coultas was the author of a number of popular books on botany, among them The Plant: An Illustration of the Organic Life of the Animals (Philadelphia, 1855). He also contributed articles on the subject to such widely read periodicals as Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine. A reviewer of his What May Be Learned from a Tree described the volume as "popular, and at the same time a scientifically accurate exposition." Unsigned review, North American Review, vol. 91 (October, 1860), p. 573. While there is no evidence that Gifford knew Coultas's pub- lications, it would seem likely, given their popularity and also Gifford's interests as a landscape painter. In addition, Gifford appears to have had some knowledge of botany. While in Lon- don in 1855, he wrote home of his visit to the Crystal Palace: "Botany is finely illustrated through the long aisles of the Palace. The products of many distant climes here flourish in close neighborhood. The beautiful palms of the tropics (which interested me) are a very striking feature in the building." In the The American Art Journal/Volume XXXII * Numbers 1 and 2 73</page><page sequence="30">same communication, he also remarked on the rich variety of trees and other vegetation he had encountered in the city's great parks, noting "in the shrubberies are extensive collections of flowering plants and shrubs, native and exotic, and also for- eign trees, among which I recognized with pleasure many familiar friends from our American woods." See Sanford Robinson Gifford to his father, Elihu Gifford, June 3, 1855, Gifford Papers, European Letters, May 1855-February 1856, pp. 21, 16, roll D21. Gifford may also have been introduced to Coultas's publications through his brother Charles, who pur- sued a career as a landscape gardener. 69.

See Sanford Robinson Gifford to Elihu Gifford, Washing- ton City, May 1, transcript in the collection of Sanford Gifford; quoted in Weiss, Poetic Landscape, p. 91. In his first missive home, the artist noted, "the prospect of fighting is much less imminent now than it was when I left New York." Gifford also served the following two summers. 71. The Reverend Dr. Bellows, "Sanford R. Gifford," Art Jour- nal (American ed.), vol. 6 (1880), p. 319; quoted in Weiss, Poetic Landscape, p. 91. This same sentiment was expressed in numerous obituary notices. The New York Times, for example, stated: "He worked steadily with his brush until 1861, when the attack upon Fort Sumter aroused his patriotism.... His love of country was great, and he entered the service from purely patri- otic motives." "A New York Artist Dead: Sanford R. Gifford Taken Off by Pneumonia," New York Times, August 30, 1880. 72. No. 249 in the Memorial Catalogue, as Baltimore in 1862,--a Sunset, from Federal Hill. A now-lost study for it, Baltimore in 1862, a Sketch (8 x 12 inches), is no. 248. The Memorial Catalogue lists two other exhibition-sized Civil War subjects, along with studies for them: Sketch of the Bivouac of the Seventh Regiment in Virginia, no. 243 (9 x 15 inches; pri- vate collection), reproduced in Eleanor Jones Harvey, The Painted Sketch: American Impressions from Nature, 1830-1880, exhibition catalogue, Dallas Museum of Art (Dal- las, 1998), p. 216, no. 59; Bivouac of the Seventh Regiment at Arlington Heights, Va., no. 244 (1861, 18 x 30 inches; Seventh Regiment Fund); Sunday Morning at Camp Cameron, no. 245 (1861, 7 x 12 inches); and Sunday Morning at Camp Cameron, near Washington, in May, 1861, no. 246 (16 x 30 inches; Sev- enth Regiment Fund). Gifford included all three of the above- mentioned exhibition-sized Civil War paintings on his list of "Chief Pictures." 73. Henry T. Tuckerman, Book of the Artists (1867; reprint ed., New York, 1967), p. 527. 74. New York Daily Tribune, April 16, 1864, p. 12. 75. So central to the spirit of the nation was the Catskills, Washington Irving believed, that "this great poetical region of our country . . . a magnificent and all-pervading feature... might have given our country a name, and a poetical one, had not the controlling powers of common-place determined other- wise." Washington Irving, "The Catskill Mountains," in The Home Book of the Picturesque: or, American Scenery, Art and Literature (New York, 1852), p. 72. One contemporary critic, pronouncing Gifford's A Twilight in the Catskills "eminently American," called for it to be "chromatyped for [the] sake of art." See "Gifford's 'Clove of the Kauterskill, Sunset."' 76. As Lincoln himself said in an interview with the Seventh Regiment in April: "Defend Washington, blockade the ports, and retake government property." See J. G. Nicolay and John Hay, Abraham Lincoln: A History (New York, 1890), vol. 4, p. 258; quoted in William J. Roehrenbeck, The Regiment That Saved the Capital (New York, 1961), p. 24. See also William Swinton, History of the Seventh Regiment (New York, 1870). 77. Gifford to George B. Coale, January 13, 1863, Boston Pub- lic Library; quoted in Weiss, Poetic Landscape, p. 96. Coale was the owner of Kauterskill Clove, a Study of 1862 (private collection; no. 270 in the Memorial Catalogue); see also note 79. 78. Gifford, Fort Federal Hill, Baltimore, to "Mrs. Wheeler, Cannie, Tom, Jerome &amp; Lamb," July 2, 1862, transcript in the collection of Sanford Gifford; quoted in Weiss, Gifford, p. 225, and by Avery in American Paradise, p. 224. 79. The now-lost canvas of 1863 is listed in the Memorial Cat- alogue as Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills, no. 282 (48 x 38 inches; in the collection of D. Willis James). Gifford exhibited the work in the 1863 spring annual at the National Academy of Design (no. 15, Kauterskill Clove, in the collection of D. Willis James). See also note 36. The entry for Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills in the Memorial Catalogue indicates it is the same work listed as no. 28 in the checklist of the Gifford Memorial Exhibition of 1880-1881 (see note 18). The entry in the checklist for Kauterskill Clove, no. 96 (1862; 15 x 12 inches; owned by George B. Coale of Baltimore), contains a cross-reference to no. 28 in the same list, indicating the former is a study for the now-lost Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills. That the Kauterskill Clove owned by Coale is a preliminary work is apparent from the entry for the painting in the Memorial Cata- logue: see no. 270, where it is entitled Kauterskill Clove, a Study (1862; 15 x 12 inches; owned by George B. Coale of Bal- timore). This entry also contains a cross-reference to no. 96 in the checklist, making it clear that both no. 96 in the checklist and no. 270 in the Memorial Catalogue refer to the same work. Kauterskill Clove, a Study is now in a private collection. The painting has a vertical format and depicts the western end of Kauterskill Clove from an outcropping on the north wall known as Sunset Rock. Long shadows falling across the land- scape indicate the time of day to be just before sunset and the yellow and reds on the foliage the time of year late summer or early autumn. We can surmise from this surviving study that the format and vantage point of the now-lost Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills were the same as those in Kauterskill Clove in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (see Fig. 18) and that the atmospheric effects were similar as well. For a reproduction of the study, see American 18th Century, 19th Century &amp; Western Paintings, Drawings, Watercolors and Sculpture, auction cata- logue, Sotheby Parke Bernet, New York, October 17, 1980, no. 122. Nearly identical to Kauterskill Clove, a Study is a small oil entitled Kauterskill Falls of 1862-1865 (10 3/4 x 8 7/8 inches; private collection). See Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., Sanford Robin- son Gifford, 1823-1880, exhibition catalogue, University of Texas Art Museum (Austin, 1970), no. 31. 74 Greenhalgh/Gifford</page><page sequence="31">80. The privately owned October in the Catskills (37 1/4 x 29 3/4 inches) of 1880 resembles the canvas of the same title in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (see Fig. 20), but with the rocks, trees, and ledge in the foreground depicted in reverse, as in Gifford's Autumn in the Catskills of 1871 (see Fig. 19); for a reproduction, see Ilene Susan Fort and Michael Quick, American Art: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection (Los Angeles, 1991), p. 183. The Art Institute of Chicago has in its collection a small oil entitled Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills (13 5/16 x 10 3/4 inches), which appears to be related to the October in the Catskills in Los Angeles (see Fig. 20). It is no. 171 in the Memorial Catalogue; for a reproduction, see Weiss, Poetic Landscape, p. 321. A work cited in the Memorial Catalogue as A Study of October Woods in Kauterskill Clove (no. 716; 14 x 12 inches; listed as sold in 1880 to George Peabody Russell in England), now lost, would also seem to relate to the Los Ange- les painting or to the privately owned canvas of the same title. 81. Gifford produced numerous other small-scale paintings of the clove in this same format. There are extant, for example, at least three small-sized oils dating from 1861-1862 that relate to Kauterskill Clove of 1862 (see Fig. 18). In all three, Gifford employed the same overall composition as that in the Metro- politan Museum painting. They are Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills of 1862 (12 7/8 x 11 1/16 inches, Jo Ann and Julian Ganz, Jr.), listed in the Memorial Catalogue as no. 264 and included in Earl A. Powell, An American Perspective: Nine- teenth-Century Art from the Collection of Jo Ann &amp; Julian Ganz, Jr., exhibition catalogue, National Gallery of Art (Wash- ington, D.C., 1981), pp. 28-29, fig. 16, and pp. 131-132; Kauterskill Clove, in the Catskills, also of 1862 (9 7/8 x 8 1/16 inches; private collection), listed in the Memorial Catalogue as no. 407 and reproduced in American Paintings, auction cata- logue, Phillips Auctioneers, New York, May 25, 1999, no. 96; and A Sketch in Kauterskill Clove of 1861 (12 7/8 x 10 3/4 inches; Sanford Gifford), reproduced in American Paradise, p. 225. In another painting of the clove, Kauterskill Falls of 1871 (14 3/4 x 12 1/2 inches; The Detroit Institute of Arts; no. 577 in the Memorial Catalogue), Gifford employed a vertical for- mat and atmospheric effects comparable to those in the above- mentioned views, but he chose to render the scenery from a different vantage point: the work depicts the double-tiered cascade as seen from the gorge below. See Janice Simon, "Sanford R. Gifford's Kaaterskill Falls: A Place of Intimate Immensity," Bulletin of the Detroit Institute of Arts, vol. 67, no. 4 (1993), pp. 4-13. See also Weiss, Poetic Landscape, reproduced on p. 292. 82. [George W. Sheldon], "How One Landscape Painter Paints," Art Journal, vol. 3 (1877), p. 285; Sheldon's com- ments on A Twilight in the Catskills are quoted at length in Weiss, Poetic Landscape, p. 91. Apparently on the basis of Sheldon's remarks, Weiss stated that A Twilight in the Catsksills "appeared at a moment of, and surely expressed, both personal and national anguish," associating the work with political events of the day and the deteriorating mental health of Gifford's brother Charles. 83.
