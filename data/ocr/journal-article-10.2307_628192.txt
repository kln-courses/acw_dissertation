<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIS GENITI ALL Greek religion is haunted by an anxiety, or a hope, which is generally summed up, since the great work of Mannhardt and Frazer, as the yearly worship of vegetation gods. The name is, admittedly, a little too narrow. No doubt in a simple agricultural community the chief anxiety is about next year's harvest. I am told that in Jerusalem the High Priest went out to see how the barley was getting on, and lengthened or shortened the official year accord- ingly. Of course there is also anxiety about the young of the flocks and herds, about the weather for sailing and the like; but I think we shall find that it extended much further. The phrase 'Year Spirit' is perhaps better than 'Vegetation God '. Jane Harrison was much criticised for preferring the phrase 'EviauTrb Oaifpcov; but I think she was right, and perhaps more profoundly right than any of us saw at the time. 'Evitaur6S is a curious word. The new Liddell and Scott gives its root meaning as 'anniversary '. It seems to be formed like Fvtoi, vi-o-rE, ' there are who . . .' 'there are times when .. .', and to mean ' There is (or 'there is present') the same ', Evt-airr6g; or, more analytically still, 'there is present-again-this ', Evt-ca-"r6s.1 From meaning ' anniversary' it comes to mean a recurrent vital day, or the period, however long, between the recurrent vital days. All kinds of events were due to occur -rrfepvtAop~vov ivtatvurrv, as in Od. A 16, which seems to mean ' as the anniversaries recur', but easily becomes 'with the passing years '. Children are born rimrororrpivcov viou-rc$v, (Theog. 493, Asp. 87) meaning, I think, ' when the regular vital time comes on', not ' as the months pass '. The popular year, of course, was reckoned by rough practical signs, as we see in Hesiod; but astronomy was a very ancient science, and among the learned there were constant attempts to fix for important festivals a piyay avtctrr6s, a 'great recurrence ', when the Sun-cycle and the Moon-cycle, which so obstinately refused to agree in the ordinary solar year, should at last exactly coincide. The trietiris was tried, then the pentetiris; at last an almost exact cycle was discovered by Meton the fifth-century astronomer (Diod. Sic. II. 47). It was an EiKoalETrrpis, completed at the winter solstice, on the vrl Kcai virca of the nineteenth and twentieth years, the exact moment at which in the Odyssey text, as at present revised, Odysseus and Penelope come together again (Rise of the Greek Epic, ed. 4, P. 21I f.). There was also the Iy3a1roS vLcvurTg, when the whole cycle of the Ages would be complete and the life of the universe would either start again and repeat itself or else be finally transformed into the divine fire or soul. It is a doctrine of the Stoics but not peculiar to them. It was also Pythagorean: it is used by some Epicureans and by Heraclitus. Its roots evidently ran deep. The arrival of each Eniautos is the beginning of a new Aidn or Age. One knows how greatly this idea was developed in some of the Hellenistic cults, but I think there is evidence of its use at least as early as Heraclitus. What does he mean exactly by saying (Fr. 52D), Aicbv o-n T-raTs TraCi3coV, rrereaCv. rrait86b i paactaXril. 'The Aidn is a child playing, moving the pieces; the Kingdom belongs to a child'. Combine that with Euripides Heraclidae 900, which couples together Moipa TEEXaaLctSrTErpa AiCv TE XPp6VOv Trais, 'Fate the giver of fulfilment, and Aion the child of Time '. That means, I think, that Aion, the particular epoch or New Age, is the child of Time, the continuous. One cannot but compare the probable reading of Fr. 50D, where Heraclitus says, in his characteristic style, that the whole is Gtacltper6v d68caxtpr6v, yevrlryv dcyEvErlr6v, OvrTb6v &amp;Odxvarov: so far so good: then it continues k6yov (&amp;Aoyov, Xp6vov) ai&amp;ovcx, rwr~pca vi6v where the two words in brackets are Diel's convincing conjecture. 'Reason, Unreason, Time (the absolute), Ai6n (the age of a particular man or generation or race),2 Father Son'. In reading Heraclitus and his contemporaries it is important to remember what a common and 1 Boisacq and others connect it with iv-labco ' to rest in '. 2 See Wilamowitz on Eur. Her., 669. 120</page><page sequence="2">DIS GENITI 121 regular thing in Greek worship were the mysteries, how familiar every Greek peasant was with the idea of aiviypacra,' mystic meanings', and &amp;ppnrl-a, things which were not to be revealed to the uninitiated; and also, of course, how vividly the ancient Greek personified things that to us are not in the least like persons. We have much to learn from Kretschmer's analysis of the name Dionysus (Cook, Zeus II, 271 ff.). It is Thracian; and it appears in the Thraco-Phrygian inscriptions as Dios Nusos, or Deos Nusos. Nusos is known to mean something like ' son ' or ' young '. Dios or Deos was taken by Kretschmer to be a genitive, but later research seems to show that it is really a nominative, the name of the Thracian god equivalent to the Greek Zeus. Dionysus is simply the Young Zeus, or Zeus the Son, the New King whose advent is in Greek myth and ritual generally combined with the casting out of the caxppaK65, the old and polluted King of the past. Incidentally we may notice that if Dionysus is the Young Zeus, that explains why he is taunted with being beardless and womanlike. It also explains why his death, unlike that of Osiris and the others, who are publicly mourned, is apprlrov (Hdt II 61, 132); the being that is cast out or torn to pieces in the ritual story of the Bacchae and Aeschylus' Edoni, cannot really be the New King, Dionysus, but must be his enemy, the Old King, dressed to look like him.3 In terms of vegetation the Old Year dies but has left some seeds of life in the earth; the evergreen pine and ivy show that the Earth is not really dead, and in due course as the Eniautos returns, there comes the New Aion or age, with the young kids, lambs, fawns, and the rest. The French word renouveau describes the process; in the magical literature it is sometimes called alcbv rracyyEvtis, but let us see the myth in its simplest form among the earliest gods. In the beginning, Hesiod tells us, there was the Old King, Ouranos, the Sky, who wedded Gaia, the Earth, and hated his sons and 'hid ' or 'buried them'. Presumably, by analogy from similar stories, he knew that his son would overthrow him (cf. Theog. 464). His youngest Son, Kronos, with the help of the Queen Mother, Gaia, did overthrow him and reigned in his stead. Then Kronos was the Old King; he wedded Rhea, another name, according to Eustathius, for the Earth Goddess; he knew that he was doomed to be overthrown by one of his sons, so he 'devoured ' them, except the youngest, Zeus, who was saved and, with the help of the Queen Mother, overthrew old Kronos and cast him and his followers out into darkness. Then Zeus was King, but is he too to be overthrown by his son ? Surely that cannot be. Yet the thought of it lingers. In the Prometheus it is not exactly Zeus who will have a son mightier than his father; it is Thetis, his intended bride, who is fated to have this terrible son. So if he does not marry Thetis he escapes the doom. To Aeschylus the Olympian Zeus is the final consummation of these divine wars; the two previous Kings of the World had fought and conquered by brute force; Zeus, the Third, had the power to learn and led man the way to cp6vrinal (Ag. 160-183). Therefore he is permanent. But there was also another story. Zeus married another Earth-goddess, Semele, and had a son, Dionysus. Let us take the story in its Thracian or Phrygian form: Deos or Dios married Zemela, the Thracian word for Earth which we still know in the Slavonic name of Nova Zembla (J. Harrison, Prolegomena, p. 404), and begot the son Deos Nusos, the Young Deos, the New King, whose normal business is to supersede the Old King. In the Greek myth Zeus marries the mortal princess Semele, who dies giving birth to Dionysus. Dionysus, important as he is in Greek Mythology, does not in the ordinary versions supersede Zeus. I suspect that such an act would be, like the death of Dionysus himself, &amp;ppTrl-rov, a thing not to be spoken. Yet there seem to be traces of just such a supersession. In one of the Orphic fragments (Proclus on Kratylus 396B, p. 55, 5 Pasquali) Zeus hands over to Dionysus the throne and the sceptre, establishes him as King of the Cosmic Gods, and says to the New Gods-observe that phrase-K?~A3Tr, 0Eo, r76v8' Oipplv yo c patMjac TriLOPi. I cannot but compare with this the culminating ceremony of the Anthesteria, when the 'very old xoanon of Dionysus' is brought out of its hidden temple and married to the 3 Possibly this idea of the substitution of a false Dionysus may have had an influence on the heresy of the Docetae, who held that it was not the real Christ but an umbra that had died on the cross.</page><page sequence="3">122 GILBERT MURRAY ' Basilinna ', the Young Queen; a queer and rude ceremony which I think is perhaps parodied in the final scene of Aristophanes' Birds, where Peithetairos insists on obtaining the hand of the Basileia, the Queen, and becomes thereby a new Zeus, wielding the thunderbolt, ruling the heavens, and hailed as 8a6x6vcov prr~pTa-rroS. Thus we have two conceptions; in the accepted Olympian myth there were three successive Kings of the Universe, reaching their climax and conclusion by the victory of Zeus, the eternal King; but to another, and apparently more original conception, the series has no conclusion, since the Old Zeus gives way to a Young Zeus, and he at the end of the year will pass it on to another New Zeus.4 Nay more; if we look carefully, the series not only has no end; it has no beginning either. For Ouranos himself is not the first of things; like all his successors he is the son of Gaia (Theog. 126). She produced him taov 'autrrt, equal to herself; the series lasts as long as Earth herself shall last. Now let us consider more in detail the separate figures in this sequence, Old King, Earth Mother, and Young King. The Old King is an enemy to his children, McprEp?~o 8' X0ovTro TOKfIl, 6aXrEpV 8' 'XerpE "rOKiCa (Theog. 155 ff-, 138), though in the Orphic scheme this is softened down, doubtless for purposes of edification, and Zeus of his free will gives over the sovereignty to Dionysus. Next, the Old King is a pharmakos. In the pharmakos rite at Athens we may notice two elements. There is the strange rite of a-rri3Ev EIS "r6b rrOS with scilla bulbs. That must be symbolic of castration. He is castrated and made incapable of perpetu- ating his polluted race. That would explain why Ouranos is castrated in Hesiod. Secondly, the pharmakos is cast out, as Kronos and his followers are cast away into the abyss. Next, notice the Mother. Old Kings may pass and Young kings succeed, but the Earth remains. She is the wife of the Old King, but also of the Young King; she habitually conspires with the Young King, her son, against the Old. When we come down from gods to human beings we shall find that this habit of Gaia throws some light on figures like Clytemnestra and Jocasta, and also, I think, on Gertrude in the original Hamlet story.5 Then, from the be- ginning she is a mater dolorosa. She may be comforted and released, but she always suffers first. The Earth suffers, no doubt, in the time of barrenness; that is, in the hard winter, or, under Egyptian conditions, in the scorching heat; she is also cruelly torn by the ploughshare (Soph. Ant. 338-49) and is struck by the lightning in the spring storms. In Hesiod we find that under the rule of Ouranos o-revaXi3-ro Fata c -rr'owpri, under that of Kronos 'Pjrlv EX'E ve0OS &amp;?Xao-rov (Theog. 159, 467). We shall see how strongly this suffering is emphasised when we come to the mortal mothers. The Son too has a clear character. He is, of course, roughly speaking, good, and the Old King bad. Some of the Christian heretics took this line, making Jehovah an enemy and perse- cutor of Jesus. But especially he is a general Saviour or Deliverer from the pollution of the past. In all the stories he begins by delivering his mother from her sorrow; in Hesiod he also delivers his brothers from their prisons; Zeus, in particular, goes further. He releases his Tra-rpoKaotyv'-rovS, who belong to the enemy generation. Pindar draws the full moral from this: 2s IaE 8 Zv&amp;S C 01'0ros T1ravas (Theog. 50I; Pind. Pyth. iv end). We also find in Zeus, as the Young God, a trait that is very prominent in later cult and legend. His babyhood is dwelt upon. -ola6S f p[act~rairt. Being in danger from the Old King he is carried away to Lyctus in Crete, and there danced about by armed Kouretes, who shout and clash their shields so that the child's cries are not heard. It is the same with Dionysus. He was worshipped as Liknites, a babe in the cradle. He was guarded by "rleivcal, Nurses: he was pursued, and his nurses beaten, by an angry king. Another characteristic which is common to the infant Zeus and the infant Dionysus is that both are apt to turn into Snakes. Zeus Meilichios, at Athens, Zeus Sosipolis at Olympia had snake form; in other cases Zeus is accompanied by a large Snake, while Dionysus makes some of his mystical appearances in snake form. This, however, is a mark of nearly all the Eniautos babies; like Cecrops, * One might even think of all the row of Zanes (Paus. V, 21) at Olympia, a new one perhaps added at a suitable day. 5 Hamlet and Orestes in Proceedings of the British Academy (1913-14, pp. 389 ff.).</page><page sequence="4">DIS GENITI 123 Erichthonius and others. The snake which sheds its skin and comes out renewed is a regular symbol of waXryyEvEai a. So far, roughly speaking, we have been dealing with elemental gods. Let us now consider some borderline cases, where the Father is an Olympian and the Son is not quite a god but has something divine about him. We have already noticed Zeus-Semele-Dionysus. There Semele is struck by lightning. As a mortal princess this naturally kills her, as Mother Earth it no doubt refreshed her in the spring thunderstorms; but its chief importance is as a mark of the divinity of the child. He is Sd6tr and the bringer of a new Aion. (Is this perhaps why the birthdays of philosophers were celebrated with religious honours, because they seemed to have initiated a new Aion ?) Another obvious case is Zeus-Alcmene-Heracles. Mother and son are condemned to be burned to death, but the son is saved at the last moment, and it is by fire that eventually he mounts to heaven. Heracles has a curious history in Greek thought, but emerges as a great Sdtir, a destroyer of the enemies of mankind. Like most Eniautos babies he is attended by Snakes, but-perhaps by some regrettable misunderstanding-he fights and strangles them. More interesting still is the great Soter, Asklepios. He is the son of Apollo and the mortal princess Koronis, who, like Semele, is struck dead by the divine lightning, while her babe, like the infant Dionysus, is saved. One is not surprised to read in Pausanias (2, 26) that the babe was exposed on a mountain and suckled by a bitch-hence the sacred dogs in his ritual-or that lightning played harmlessly about his head. I will not enquire why Asklepios in so many stories is struck dead by lightning, not merely after raising Hippolytus from the dead-which was perhaps unprofessional conduct-but even for curing the madness of the Proitides and the blindness of the sons of Phineus. Nor need we ask why he is always accompanied by a Snake. It is interesting, however, to note how much the widespread cry for salvation from the evil of the world which the marks later Hellenistic Age, clung to Asklepios and magnified his worship. He was the Healer of Sick Humanity, the Saviour par excellence. His worship spreads all over the Mediterranean world. He grants prophecies and revelations (Reitzenstein, Mysterienreligionen, p. 128). He is connected with Hermes Trismegistos, but, most significant of all, he becomes a special object of Christian polemic. Arnobius (I 49 et saepe) does not deny his remarkable cures, but points out that they were only achieved by regular medical treatment, not, like those ofJesus, by direct word of command. It has also been thought that his art-type, the mild and bearded face, was chosen for the representation ofJesus.6 The point is disputed. We must wait for Sir John Beazley to tell us who is right. Rather curious is the case of the Dioskouroi. They are sons of Zeus and the mortal woman Leda or else Nemesis. They are the Kouroi or Young Men of Zeus, and I cannot help suspecting that they are largely thought of as wrriKovpot, Helpers in Battle. I will not discuss the special points of their twinship, their connection with particular stars, or with the two pillars that are necessary to uphold a roof. For our present purpose they fall into the class of Sons of God who are Xcoorgpes, Saviours in general, especially from defeat in battle and from the perils of the sea. In speaking of the Sons of God, we must always remember that the word 8E65 or Deus in a polytheist society is very different indeed from the word God among Christians or Jews or Arabs; and also, what is not quite so obvious, that the word 'son' in simple ancient com- munities is often used to denote all sorts of relations for which they had no exact terminology. The Amphictyons, 'Dwellers-round', are sons of an imaginary 'Dweller-round', and when the author of Genesis X wishes to say that some of the population of the great Hittite Empire spread over into the land of Canaan, the way he expresses it is 'Canaan begat Heth.' Remembering this I think we can see how this idea of Sons of Theoi as S6tbres and inaugurators of a New Age, to save us from all those innumerable things from which we need salvation, became one of the great emotional emblems of man, almost what Jung calls a 'Primordial Image '. 6 See Edelstein, Asclepius II xo8 ff., 132 and 224.</page><page sequence="5">124 GILBERT MURRAY But now let us see what happens when the old elemental gods are supplanted by the Olympians; the myth is made more anthropomorphic and taken in its literal sense. In such a case one begins to judge the god by human standards, and the story becomes repulsive. It becomes, as Satyrus says in his Life of Euripides, a tale of piaalooi rrapOEvcov and irrroopoXai -wat?rov, the first a well-known ugly crime and the second a disreputable expedient. Why was it such a common theme for tragedy? The answer seems obvious. Because it expressed in parable that birth of the Dzios Nusos, or Young Zeus, which was the central myth of the Festival. The story might not be dramatically sympathetic, but ritually it was a necessity. It had to come in somewhere. I will recapitulate briefly a number of Euripidean tragedies on this theme which I analysed in C.Q. vol. xxxvii, 1943- ION. Apollo and the Attic princess Creusa. Misery of Creusa; baby Ion nearly cast to death (1.27.46). Cradle with golden snakes. Recognised; becomes founder of the Ionians. ALOPE. Poseidon and Alope, daughter of Kerkyon. Alope walled up by angry Kerkyon. Baby exposed, suckled by mare, brought up by shepherds. Named Hippothoos; recog- nised, becomes founder of Eleusis. Kerkyon killed. ANTIOPE. Zeus in satyr form and Antiope, daughter of Nycteus. Antiope flies to Mt. Kithairon, there bears twins Amphion and Zethus. Angry father commits suicide, but charges his successor Lycus and his wife Dirce to punish Antiope. Recognition. The twins become founders of Thebes. Dirce killed. AUGE. Heracles and Auge, daughter of Aleos, the Arcadian king. Baby Telephus born in temple of Athena Alea; angry father; babe cast out to die on Mt. Parthenion, suckled by deer. Mother condemned to be burnt alive. Recognition. Auge saved. Telephus founder of royal race in Mysia. MELANIPPE. Two plays by Euripides. Poseidon and Melanippe, daughter of Hellen. Twins exposed, suckled by cow. Condemned to be burned as monstrosities; Melanippe in one play to be burned with them (?), in the other imprisoned and blinded. Recognition. The persecutors killed. The twins are Aeolus and Boeotus, founders of the Aeolians and Boeotians. The same myth-form occurs in at least four plays of Sophocles. TYRO. Poseidon and Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus. Twins, Pelias and Neleus, thrown into river, rescued by a horse-herd (Iwrrropopp6s). Perhaps suckled by mare ? Tyro beaten cruelly by stepmother, Sidero. Recognition; Sidero killed at altar; Pelias founder of Iolcos, Neleus of Pylos. ALEADAI. Auge daughter of Aleos with child by Heracles; given by angry father to Nauplius to drown; on the way gives birth to the babe Telephus on Mt. Parthenion. Baby saved; recognised; becomes king of Mysia. HIPPONOus. His daughter Periboia with child by Ares; sent with baby to Oineus to be killed. Somehow saved; becomes Bellerophon, inventor of horsemanship and slayer of the Chimaera. DANAE. Daughter of Acrisios, imprisoned because her child is fated to kill the Old King his grandfather; nevertheless has child by Zeus; thrown into sea in a chest with the child; rescued by Dictys; her son Perseus, slayer of the Gorgon, ancestor of the Persians. He duly kills Acrisios by accident. Without trying to make a complete list we may note among the works of the other tragedians an ALOPE by Choirilos and Karkinos; an ALCMENE by Ion, Astydamas, and Dionysius; a LEDA by Dionysius; a SEMELE by Karkinos, and a TYRO by Karkinos in addition to two by Sophocles. In all these the story is half-humanised. The Father God is an Olympian; the place of</page><page sequence="6">DIS GENITI 125 the suffering Earth-Mother is taken by a human princess, and that of the Young Zeus, or New Year God, by a human hero. But we may note two or three points that result from this change. First the Olympian god cannot, like Ouranos and Kronos, be made a pharmakos and cast out. That role is apt to be taken by the heroine's angry father, an Old King, who, like Ouranos and Kronos, is the enemy of his children. The heroine, like Gaia and Rhea, is always mater dolorosa. The son, like Kronos and Zeus, is somehow 'hidden' or exposed; then he is- ' recognised ' and becomes the Founder of a race or kingdom, bringing a 'peripeteia' and a new Aidn. Further, like Zeus and Dionysus, he is generally connected with some animal, suckled by a cow, sheep, mare, deer, or goat, or else simply found among the flocks. One is reminded of the manger and the worshipping shepherds. As a baby, like Zeus and Dionysus, he always has a narrow escape from a wicked Herod. It is clearly the same essential story, the story of the Eniautos-Babe, the New King casting out the Old, assuming the throne and inaugurating a New Age. It is the divine father who gives trouble. Originally, when he was Ouranos, the Sky, wedded to Gaia, the Earth, no moral question arose. Even when he was the local River or Mountain, like Enipeus or Strymon or Pelion, he was fairly impersonal and was the natural source for a royal race. But in these dramas he has been transformed into one of the personal Olympian gods, Zeus or Apollo or Poseidon, and two difficulties arise. An Olympian god does not make a possible pharmakos. He cannot be either killed or cast to the darkness, as an impersonal Old Year could. Also he is a person, and must bear some personal responsibility. If he were human he could repent and be forgiven. But as a god he cannot. Only in one passage (Auge fr. 265) do we find a father saying, ' I confess I have done wrong, but I did not mean it.' That is Heracles, who is at least half-human. One cannot help wondering how the action of the God was treated in these lost tragedies. Was it made mystical or at least inscrutable, and treated in a religious or quasi-religious spirit ? Or was the myth, with all its lack of morals, taken as it stood and merely made into an exciting story, with no particular ethical or psychological interest ? I suppose this latter hypothesis is on the whole most probable, though it so happens that the one play of this Son-of-god type which is preserved, the Ion, passes very strong moral judgement on the god, and one other treatment of a similar story idealises all guilt away. The Ion has a cynical tone. Apollo is treated as the villain of the piece, and not only a villain but a coward and a bungler as well. His plots misfire. His victim, in the best scene of the play, curses him before his own altar. At the end he dare not show his face. I have suggested elsewhere that the effect of the Ion may well have been to make the authorities feel that this son-of-god myth, though an essential element in the Eniautos religion, was not suitable for tragedy (C.Q. loc. cit.). But there is one other treatment of this type of myth extraordinarily different, the story of Io as told by Aeschylus in the Supplices and the Prometheus. Here the whole theme is put on an ideal plane. Zeus did indeed cause great suffering to Io, but the result was more than worth it. There is no thought of lust. The god only laid his hand on Io and breathed his spirit into her. Her divine Son was born, i aqirca i K&amp; mrrirrvoifaS At6, from the touch and the breath, or inspiration, of Zeus. (Suppl. I8 f.). Further on it is by the \6yo0, the &amp;ylsu8~is 6yoS, that she conceives and bears in the end a flawless child,' through a long age (or his long Aidn) perfect in blessedness '. This treatment is the more surprising since in the usual story, which is duly accepted in Suppl. 301, Io was transformed into a cow, and Zeus, in order to mate with her, took the shape of a bull. This presumably goes back, as Professor Dodds suggests to me, to a 'lepb6 I'dCloS in the cult of"Hpca pocrri&amp;S. When Greek settlers in the Delta identified Epaphos, the offspring of this union, with the divine bull-calf Apis, who was generated by a ray of the Sun or the Moon, and by his birth spread blessing over the land, they made easy the transition to Aeschylus's treatment of the whole story. Epaphos of course was born in Egypt, and this idea of Virgin</page><page sequence="7">126 GILBERT MURRAY Birth seems to have been specially Egyptian. Plutarch (Numa 4) attributes the doctrine to 'the Egyptians ' and finds it oK d-rriOavov. More at length elsewhere (in Quest. Conviv. viii I) he accepts the Egyptian view that a god begets his son oiX d S &amp;vvpcwros, &amp;?' 'ripals -rTiiv &amp;qc&amp;iS Kia q Ca'iaEaIv (Norden, p. 48). As we know, Egyptian influence came to Greece very early. Apart from the Virginity motive, Aeschylus explains with clear emphasis that the purpose of Zeus from the beginning was to produce a Saviour of mankind; it is a proof of his supreme wisdom and righteousness (see the magnificent hymn, Suppl. 570-599). But now turn to the Prometheus, which of course was later than the Supplices. How do we explain the bitter de- nunciation of Zeus for his treatment of Io there ? (734-740). He is a tyrant and ravisher, violent everywhere, P=iltoS i r&amp; wr&amp;ave' 6p5, though it is true that, by this violence, he creates not only a general bringer of Blessing, like Apis-Epaphos, but actually the eventual deliverer of Prometheus himself. I think the answer must be that, in the reconciliation which we know took place at last between Zeus and Prometheus, one element was that Prometheus saw that he had misjudged his great enemy. The true Zeus is the Zeus of the Supplices and of Agamemnon 161-183. The common popular tradition was always apt to meet with one of two treatments. The current myth was either denounced as immoral and therefore untrue, as by writers like Xenophanes and Heraclitus and Euripides, or else it was re-interpreted and allegorised on the lines of, say, Pindar and Aeschylus. But in the theatre of Dionysus this particular theme of the birth of the Young God had, I think, a curious end. As I have suggested in the C.Q. xxxvii, the theme was gradually recognised as unsuitable for tragedy; the God cut too miserable or offensive a figure. Yet the Eniautos theme was essential to the Dionysiac festival. It could not be quite abandoned. It was taken on by the New Comedy in a completely humanised fbrm, with the hidden child, the suffering mother, a recognition and peripeteia which 'saves the situation ', and-quite a new note-a guilty but repentant father. In the only plays of which adequate fragments exist the passionate repentance of the various sinners, i.e. Polemo, Charisius, and the two old men in the Samia, is an important element in the play. What then is the main argument of this paper? It is to study the idea of an Eniautos- daimon, a Zeus the Son, who is born rrEplTopTiivc~v aivrrCv, and brings with him a new Aidn which is unpolluted, while the old polluted past withers away or is cast out; whose birth brings deliverance to the suffering Mother Earth, and cleansing to the world in general. I am suggesting that this whole complex of ideas is a widespread and profound element in Greek religious tradition. And I think we cannot help noticing that it goes further, and plays a great part in that intense flowering of religious and mystical aspiration which resulted from the meeting of Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian, and primitive Anatolian thought in the age which is called Hellenistic, and which has had such lasting influence on the whole Western world. The longing for somre mythical or human S6ter, inaugurating a new Aidn and described as the son of a God and a mortal woman, is persistent through all those parts of the ancient world of which we have information. It is constantly recurrent in Greece. It is regularly accepted in Egypt. It takes of course a different form in the territories of the great Asiatic Mother Goddess, and is rejected by Hebrew monotheism. Professor Kennett held that Jahweh was really, like Allah, a desert god; hence his hostility to the Baalim and their odious consorts and fertility ceremonies. When the ' sons of the Elohim ' in Genesis vi took wives of the daughters of men and produced heroes and giants, that to the Jahvist was part of the general wickedness which led to the Flood; to the rest of the nations it was either a normal annual process or a special blessing. The true 8toyEvETS or 0Esv TrCdlES are always deliverers from past pollution and in- augurators of a new age. But their forms vary. First, we have the divine Baby as he appears in the Fourth Eclogue. We have the baby Zeus with his protecting Kouretes, the baby Dionysus with his Nurses. We have numbers of supernatural babies discovered in a chest, like Perseus, in a cradle like Ion, in a boat like Neleus and Pelias, generally nursed by a cow or</page><page sequence="8">DIS GENITI 127 sheep or mare or some wild animal, and especially associated with the mystic snake. In Egypt there was a very special divine Baby, Harpocrates; 'No God', says Ermann (Norden p. 73), 'lay so near the heart of the people as the little Harpocrates': that is, Har-pe-chrot, 'Horus the Babe ', whose figurines represent him as a small child playing. Is it not on these lines that we should interpret that oracle of Heraclitus: Aicv aris i-ct ri rracicov Trcat8o5 l' PacmiXrli'r. 'The Ai6n is a babe playing: the kingdom is the Babe's'? We may remember the strange power in many parts of Europe of the infant Jesus. I have seen in an Italian church a primitive and rather moving adoration of a Bambino who at the suitable moment turned into a lamb. Then of course the ordinary 8ioyvis, or Son of Zeus, is a fighter and conqueror. He saves by destroying the enemy. The chief example of this type is Heracles, always delivering mankind from oppressors and monsters. There is the same quality in Theseus, son of Poseidon. He saves maidens from the Minotaur and slays the oppressors Skiron, Sinis, and Procrustes. There is some of the same quality in Perseus, slayer of the Gorgon and of his mother's enemies; some in the Dioskouroi, who turn the tide in battle and save sailors in storms. This force, I tentatively suggest, lived on chiefly in various Kings, from Alexander and his successors onward. Titles like S6ter and Euergetes suggest it. Mark Antony posed as being Dionysus, and even 'the Young' or ' the New' Dionysus, while oth.er princes claimed to be Heracles. But this special conception no doubt became swamped by the common ruler-worship of the East. The martial hero-saviour finds some expression in the conquering Dionysus of Nonnus, whose superiority to Perseus and Heracles is the theme of Bk. 25, and it was prominent in the Sol Invictus Mithras, the special god of the Roman army. Sometimes again the Son of the God is a mediator, interpreter or interceder between the worshipper and the God himself. This comes no doubt from the oriental conception of the God as an unapproachable supreme King, who can be addressed only through his favourites or by the use of their name. Apollo is regularly rrpotpfirrl-s At6s (Eum. 19, 616) and 'has never spoken from his mantic throne one word that was not commanded by Zeus'. Athena has at times a similar quality. But the most striking case is to be found in the Hermetic literature, where almost every approach to Hermes Trismegistos is by the mediation of his son Thoth. In the medieval Church, though this part essentially belongs to the divine Son, there is much hope of special intercession by the Virgin and by certain of the Saints. It cannot but strike any student of these ideas how many of them seem to occur, either independently or by imitation, in many different mediterranean myths and how many have lived on in certain forms of Christianity. They seem to have in them, as I have suggested, much of what Dr. Jung calls Primordial Images; the metaphors or symbols which recur constantly in the human mind, as instruments to express or satisfy certain deep-seated emotions for which there is no scientific terminology. It is interesting to note, among the current Hellenistic phrases of the time, those which the Pauline tradition accepts and those which it avoids. There is of course a great difference between the different epistles. The so-called 'Four Great Epistles' avoid the pagan word lco-rlp, though the need for it was irresistible and it forced its way into Christian language very early. They admit cow-rrlpia. They accept vibs 0Eo0, Son of God, though it must, one would suppose, have done violence to Jewish habits of thought. None of the Epistles mentions the Bambino, nor yet the Divine Mother, 0EoT6KOS, though here again the longing for both of them among the peoples of southern and eastern Europe has proved irresistible. They make considerable use of the conception aic'v which the authorised version translates 'world' and rather confuses with K6crpOS. (2 Cor. iv. 4, Gal. i. 4, Eph. i. 21, ii. 2, I Tim. vi. i7, II Tim. iv. io, Tit. ii. I2). They make no use of the special magic power of a Name-in great contrast to St. John (xiv. 13, 14: xv. I6: xvi. 23, 24, 26). They make frequent mention of elements, principalities, powers, and dominions- O-rolXEicia, ouai, &amp;PXcai, wvv&amp;IEIS, but regard them as enemies to the faith, which the Christian must fight against. Did the writer think of them as real hostile beings, or merely as winds of false doctrine ?</page><page sequence="9">128 DIS GENITI These primordial ideas live on. They change names and forms, but cannot be eradicated. They are things which, in Sallustius's memorable phrase y~4E'vro Ev oCrrrorE, orn 8' &amp;Ei. We all remember the old woman in Mr. Lawson's book on Modern Greek Folklore (p. 573) who was in a state of great anxiety as Easter approached: ' Of course I am anxious; for if Christ does not rise tomorrow we shall have no corn this year '. The Eniautos and its new Aion were still a recurrent hope, not an event that had happened long ago, once for all. I suspect that of all these primordial images, if that is their right name, the most permanent and indestructible is the longing for Kaoapp6o, purification, cleansing, for 'deliverance from the body of this death'. It seems to take two forms. In most religions, ancient and modern, it is a personal thing; repentance followed by forgiveness and always associated with some half-magical special rite. This message also has its place in drama. The god who appears in the final scene of so many Euripidean tragedies has practically always the same message: 'Give up your revenges! Repent and forgive one another.' It is so in the Electra, the Hippolytus, the Iphigenia Taurica, the Helena, the Orestes, and perhaps we may add the Alcestis. And we have noticed how this note of repentance and forgiveness is quite at home in the very mundane stories of the New Comedy. The other form is that which we have been considering, the cleansing not of oneself but of the whole world by the casting out of the polluted past and the Rebirth of all life. The Eniautos is completed; the Old Man or Pharmakos is cast away. It is the Day of the New Man, the New Age, the most inspiring and dangerous of dreams. It is splendid in the sixth chapter of Isaiah, in the Fourth Eclogue, in the Book of Revelation; dangerous in every great revolution, ridiculous in many transient fantasies and impostures, a deadly poison in those cases, not unknown to this generation, where the fanatic's dream serves to let loose man's insatiable thirst for power. Primordial images shall we call them, dreams of mankind which 'never happened but always are '? Often we cannot but wish that they would stop and leave us in peace; but I doubt if we could live without them. GILBERT MURRAY.</page></plain_text>
