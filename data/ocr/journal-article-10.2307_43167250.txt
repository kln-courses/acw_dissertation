<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chameleons. Claudia Schnieper. 48pp. $12.95. Carolrhoda. 1989. (Grades 2-5.) This informational book, enhanced by exceptional photography, never varies in providing an encyclopedic account of the nature and function of chameleons found in many parts of the world. In 46 pages of narration, the character- istics of chameleons are carefully organized to include habitats, adaptation, reproduc- tion, and similarities with other lizards and reptiles. There is a detailed description of color changes with vivid illustrations for emphasis, but these are too technical for the young reader to comprehend. This book corrects misconceptions about color changes and camouflage. There is much evidence of anthropomorphism through- out the text - especially when discussing animal "moods." On the whole, however, the information is factual and accurate. The reading level is not geared for the elementary school child. The young reader will need help in vocabulary development, defining scientific terms, phonetic spelling, and the pronunciation system. The glos- sary is helpful, but a child will need a teacher's guidance to overcome the level of difficulty. The striking photography shows color and structure in detail. Many of the pic- tures of chameleons are magnified and appear in natural settings. It would have been helpful to note the degree of magni- fication alongside the photograph. The book has many outstanding fea- tures - good quality paper and typography, excellent photography, a fine index, and much current information on the subject. Students, with the help of the teacher, will find this book an important supplement in reptile studv. Albert Piltz</page></plain_text>
