<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume XXIX OCTOBER 1949 THE TASK OF THEOLOGY CHARLES D. KEAN* I. THE DETHRONEMENT OF THEOLOGY IN THE Middle Ages theology was known as "the queen of the sci- ences." Now, in the middle of the twentieth century, few people regard it as a science at all. And, although there are still many theologians and the semi- naries are filled with candidates for the ministry, the field of theology is regarded by the general public as having little to do with everyday living. Part of the explanation of this disre- gard of theology is due to the greatly changed orientation of the word "sci- ence." In the Middle Ages the term re- ferred to knowledge and the processes of knowledge. In the modern world most people think of science as referring to the mastery and use of empirical data. But the change in emphasis in the word "sci- ence" is only a minor part of the prob- lem, even when the presuppositions of a science-centered universe are taken into account. In the days when theology was known * The Reverend Charles Duell Kean is rector of Grace Episcopal Church, Kirkwood, Mo. He was educated at Brown University and the General The- ological Seminary. For four years he was a member of the staff of the Providence (R.I.) Journal and later taught history and philosophy at Springfield College. His book The M eaning of Existence was published by Harper in I947. He has also served as co-author of The Christian Doctrine of Property (Philadelphia: Westminster, I948) and The Christian Demand for Social Justice (New York: New American Library, 1949). as the queen of the sciences, it was taken for granted that every man was con- cerned with religion. While the intensity of concern certainly varied widely, never- theless, the prevailing culture presup- posed that every man was concerned with his eternal destiny, and its institu- tions reflected this theoretical basis. Cer- tainly, there was a wide disparity be- tween the theory and the practice, but the theory was largely taken for granted. The symbols used in the Middle Ages and in the earlier years of the Protestant era to express this concern have lost much of their vitality, yet they continue to be used by their advocates as if they could be counted on to strike chords of response in the minds, if not always in the wills, of those who hear them. Thus theology is transplanted from its role of queen of the sciences, which meant at least that the pursuit of any path of learning would sooner or later confront the seeker with the underlying question of the meaning of his own life. Instead, theology is made the intramural exercise of those sufficiently interested in the in- stitutional aspects of religion to know what the words mean. The modern world has come to the curious conclusion that it is possible for a man not to be religious, not to be con- cerned with his eternal destiny. Theology is the concern, directly or indirectly, only of those who are interested, while 249 Number 4</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION those who are not interested seem to get along all right without it. Both the churched and the unchurched assume that religion is one of several depart- ments within life; and, although advo- cates of organized religion stoutly main- tain that it is the most important aspect of healthy living-indeed, the absolutely essential interest-nevertheless, they take for granted that unreligious people exist. If it is possible for men to live without religion in any form, then of course theol- ogy ought to be dethroned as queen of the sciences, since it is obviously related only to the interests of some people rather than to the essential questions of all people. The strange thing about this develop- ment in affairs, however, is that every- one, both pro and con, tends to assume that he and everyone else know what is meant when the word "religion" is used. Yet few people take the trouble to define it, and when they do the definition more often than not takes the form of either an aphorism or a phrase, which simply ex- tends the confusion rather than clarifies it. "Religion is what a man does with his solitude" is an aphorism which actually says nothing to clarify the function of religion; it only restricts its application. When the meaning of religion itself is not examined, it is hardly surprising that the meaning of terms associated with some particular religious tradition cause confusion when injected into a serious discussion whose premises have not been defined. For instance, at a recent inter- faith meeting at the University of Mis- souri, a Jesuit colleague defined the field of religion as that of "God confronting man." Though this phrase may have sig- nificant meaning-indeed, several differ- ent significant meanings-to people who already accept a frame of reference in which both words "God" and "man" re- fer to concepts commonly understood, the phrase means nothing at all in a dis- cussion that is seeking to define the meaning of religion itself. The words "God" and "man" are defined actually by the way one understands the function of religion, not vice versa. Both words raise semantic problems. They do not solve them. II. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF "GOD" The word God itself, whether spelled with a capital G or a lower-case g, ac- tually refers to the source of those de- mands which men actually accept as binding, necessary, and inevitable upon themselves. To make this recognition is merely to take into account the function- al significance of the term for religious purposes. It is not to exhaust its meaning or to restrict it in terms of the presuppo- sitions of some particular school of theol- ogy. In this general sense, the word ob- viously refers to a great many different understandings of life since men's lives are governed by various concerns. Unless the term God is understood as referring to demands felt and accepted, it loses its specifically religious signifi- cance. It may have a certain utility in a speculative analysis of the universe, varying from that of a symbol function- ally similar to x in mathematics to a con- cept of an anthropomorphic superper- sonality of a very literal type. But what gives concreteness to these understand- ings is not their relationship to the sys- tem of thought in which they are set but rather their influence upon the world in which the believer lives. There has been a lot of nonsense pub- lished on the assumption that the word God had a constant, definable content since the word could be given synonyms in the dictionary. Two years ago the Gallup Poll conducted an international investigation as to the percentage of the population in a number of different coun- tries claiming to believe in God. There 250</page><page sequence="3">THE TASK OF THEOLOGY was, however, no investigation as to what those who answered the investiga- tors meant by their answers. More re- cently the alumni organization of the University of the South has reassured its members that there was no "atheism" at Sewanee, and again no attempt was made to interpret the significance of the in- vestigation in functional terms. If any demonstration were needed of the way theology has been cut off from practical connection with politics, eco- nomics, and sociology, these surveys would serve the purpose. The only con- ceivable significance that can be given to reports purporting to prove that over- whelming majorities of people still be- lieve in God is that these reports indicate an emotional conservatism as character- istic of mankind since the only common denominator which can be ascribed to the use of the word God in these connections would be one relating the word more normally to some kind of traditional frame of reference rather than recogniz- ing its dynamic implications. In other words, the surveys seem to indicate that most men, while living in a changing world and while wanting various needs met in the course of social reconstruction, nevertheless do not want to slip their familiar moorings any more than neces- sary. Those who study individual and social problems recognize certain "laws" or principles as norms. Indeed, the purpose of research in the fields of the physical and social sciences is to discover such norms, or prevailing channels of opera- tion, together with an adequate account of why variations occur if they do, so that reasonable predictions may be made. When scientists are proceeding on the hypothesis that such norms may be accepted, they use them as presupposi- tions in further investigation. In other words, the norms or "laws" or principles of operation present certain demands which may not be ignored and which must be taken seriously. In a parallel way, those who are sensitive to their own needs and to the needs of the world around them and of which they are a part can but recognize certain obliga- tions upon man as inherent in the scheme of things. Whether the demands are thought of as primarily ethical or not does not vary the situation. Everybody makes his practical deci- sions on the basis of some kind of pre- suppositions about the nature of the universe and his relationship to it and what this demands of him if life is to be adequate. Everybody more or less rec- ognizes that this is the case. But to use the word God with specific reference to one's presuppositions for individual and social action is very rare. Consequently the word God, regardless of the theoret- ical content ascribed to it, is more often than not abstracted from the world of decision and action. To see the semantic significance of the word God is to rec- ognize its essential reference to those demands in terms of which we make our decisions. To use the word seriously with a capital G is to have some awareness of an underlying "unconditioned demand," such as Dr. Paul Tillich has pointed out, and to see this as overruling and in some way ordering all lesser demands. III. THE FUNCTION OF RELIGION The task of theology cannot be re- lated to the everyday concerns of people, to say nothing of fulfilling the traditional role of queen of the sciences, unless the function of religion is understood in some more basic way than that of the institutional or ethical enterprise of those persons who identify themselves with the word. If the term God, regard- less of its detailed content, is understood as referring to the demands which men recognize as inevitable and binding, with the word with a capital G referring 25I</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION to an ultimate unconditioned demand, then religion, functionally speaking, must refer to what men do about satisfy- ing the demands they accept. When the origin of man's religious concern-using the word "religion" in its more popular and loose sense-is seriously probed, it will be observed that it has to do with the problem of making sense out of his experience. Regardless of what men say they are doing when they are acting religiously and regardless of the specific area under inquiry-cult, creed, or custom-the purpose of the activity is directed toward making life satisfying, meaningful, integrated, ade- quate, or, in other words, toward ful- filling what appears to be demanded. Since human experience is not self- explanatory, every person has to make some kind of interpretation of his rela- tionships to the world around him, to his own self-consciousness, to other people, to social forces, and to the physical uni- verse, in order to keep going. This inter- pretation may be highly systematic or it may be following what appears to be the course of least resistance, but everybody has to make some kind of sense out of his experience in order to live with him- self, to say nothing of getting along with others. The statement that experience is not self-explanatory can be demonstrated, first, by the contradictory nature of man's relationship to time, the tension between duration and succession in his own consciousness, even when he does not deliberately attempt to rationalize the problem; and, second, by the ob- servable truth in both sides of the perennial debate between determinism and self-determination; and, third, by the gulf between man's idea and his own performance. Above all, the insoluble mystery of death makes the issue in- escapable. All these problems present threats to man's innate need for an adequate sense of security, status, and achievement without which life is not felt to be worth living. The problems may take a variety of forms and vary in the intensity with which they are encountered from time to time, but the underlying issue re- mains. The way men understand secu- rity, status, and achievement differs widely, too, since it is the result of the historical situation, individual develop- ment, and other factors. The fact re- mains, however, that men are forced to define what life demands. They have to make some kind of explanation to them- selves; they have to live by some kind of faith; or they die. They have no choice here-only the choice of the kind of faith by which they choose to live. Since men always meet their problems and make their decisions in some kind of social context and since the relationship of the individual to the group involves a continual interaction where the group supplies the thought-forms (the cate- gories into which men place their ex- perience for interpretation and the po- litical, economic, and social setting for their decisions) and since the individual on his part affects the life of the group by his decisions and actions in concrete situations, the problem of religion is never simply an individual matter. Whatever men do about interpreting life's demands and acting upon that in- terpretation is in itself a social process, with the majority of people tending simply to accept whatever is current in their society and with the minority of independent thinkers never able to cut themselves off from their history. The function of religion is, therefore, that process of interpreting experience in conformance with what both the in- dividual and his group, in interaction upon each other, take to be the inevi- table demands of life itself; and also the function includes, not as a second step, 252</page><page sequence="5">THE TASK OF THEOLOGY but as part of the process of interpreta- tion, whatever men do about meeting the demands they recognize. All religions in- clude the three aspects of cult, creed, and conduct, emphasizing the nature of the process in its relationships to the various levels of human thought and action. Cult, regardless of the simplicity or com- plexity, the formality or informality of its performance, is the dramatization of man's understanding of the demand and his living response. Creed is his intellec- tual and necessarily symbolic formula- tion of the issue. Conduct is the appli- cation of the system, whatever it is, to the normal areas of individual and social action. IV. SYMBOLS IN RELIGION The way men go about making sense out of experience is by the use of sym- bols, the purpose of which is to describe the real meaning of life's problems as they are understood and also to give the principle of dealing with them. All reli- gions use this method, because there is no other way of dealing with the totality of experience, because of the inherent am- biguities and contradictions in all human awarenesses. Aspects of human relation- ships and events may be understood in- tellectually, either logically or empiri- cally, but the totality can only be ap- preciated symbolically, since its ambi- guities and contradictions are the cause of the whole problem of interpretation to start with. Thus, in terms of this defini- tion, religion is as natural a function as digesting or breathing, because making sense out of life is as necessary. The human being in the biological functions of eating and breathing has to transform food and air into a form which can be assimilated and used by the body, and so, in a somewhat comparable manner, the total human personality has to deal with its total experience in order to appreciate it and utilize it. Religious symbols are the means by which experi- ence is made capable of "digestion," and the test of the adequacy of religious symbols is therefore on the basis of this morphology. The process of religion is primarily that of using symbols to define life's meaning. The nature of life's demands is such that men can only do justice to them when they are put in such a way as to focus the element of demand even at the expense of some distortion of ra- tional description of the setting. The significance of this principle can be easily understood from the way young people approach marriage. A marriage is not understood primarily as a physical and psychological union of two people of differing sexes for the purpose of ful- filling certain psychic, physiological, and sociological needs in a continuing soci- ety, but rather it is seen in glamorous colors. The purpose of the coloration, however, is to intensify the underlying demand. When it is taken as an end in it- self, marriage becomes mere romantic sentimentality and is doomed to failure. But without the coloration the urgency of the demand could not be fully ap- preciated. It is in a like manner that the words God and Christ have significance in the Christian tradition. Seriously using the term God the Father is a profound way of recognizing that life's demands upon men call for the most exalted self- giving personal response to other people and to situations if life's experience is to be fully adequate and that this is the way the universe works. It is more than ethical impulse: life would be better if the response were thus and so. It is a demand: do this or else. The term God the Father in the Christian tradition is a symbolic statement of an urgency which could not be transmitted by rational analyses of the relationships of cause and effect in a universal total. Likewise the 253</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION term Christ, in the Christian tradition, is a profound way of describing the basis upon which the demand may be met. Again the significance is in height- ening the urgency, rather than of ra- tional description of relationships and processes. The word Christ carries with it the implications that on no other basis can men respond in the way life itself demands. The alternative is broken men in a broken world. While traditional evangelical piety might balk at the description of its per- formance in the foregoing paragraph, ac- tually this is what gives significance to its terrific emphasis on such a passage as John 3: i6: "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten son that who- soever believeth on him shall not perish but shall have everlasting life." This is a statement of demand, of urgency, of call for decision and response. It is not an objective description of man and the universe. A great deal of confusion arises when men and women, instead of understand- ing their symbols functionally, debate their merits as if the symbols referred to constant objective realities. For instance, a certain clergyman in a church of the more orthodox Trinitarian tradition likes to describe himself as a "Unitar- ian." When asked whether he is trying to say that he believes that history is somehow ultimately self-fulfilling, he says "No" but that he is talking about the "divinity of Christ." To debate the latter expression, except by reference to the problem of life's meaning, is to con- fuse shadow and substance and throw words about. V. THE OPERATION OF THEOLOGY The operation of theology, therefore, is the process of making articulate the set of verbal symbols which serve most adequately to fulfil the religious function. This is the only task of theology. This is what it was regarded as doing when it was accepted as queen of the sciences. When it attempts any other task, it de- parts from its purpose. Theology is the interpretation, by means of verbal sym- bols, of man's concern with his own des- tiny or, in other words, with the mean- ing and purpose of his own life. The classical liberals were right in their insistence that many traditional "orthodox" symbols had become reli- giously meaningless. Their concern that man's religious practice be related to the expanding scientific horizons of the day and to the contemporary social issues was a concern that the institutional life of the churches deal with the problems with which men were actually dealing and in the context of which they were trying to discover the meaning of their own lives. The hard shell of orthodoxy tended to make the churches concerned only with the shadow, not with the sub- stance, of religion. American fundamen- talism of both the Protestant and the Roman Catholic varieties is a good ex- ample of the way loyalty to a set of words, which are alleged to refer to ob- jectivities, is made the substitute for dealing with the underlying problem of the meaning of life. What the classical liberals did not realize was that the problem dealt as much with the use to which the symbols of the Christian tradition were put as it did with the symbols themselves. Many classical liberals did not realize that the current use to which traditional symbols were being put was not the only possible use they might have. The result was that there was a serious tendency to discard tools of proved value just because the tools were being abused, on the assump- tion that the perverse use was the only possible use. It was also true that many classical liberals overlooked the fact that 254</page><page sequence="7">THE TASK OF THEOLOGY they themselves were also using a set of symbols. Any set of symbols, whether liberal or conservative in use, can be- come unhinged from its function. Liter- alized symbols are the curse of theology. The Marxist criticism of nineteenth- century political economy has brought many people to realize that all verbal symbols, whether referring to life's total meaning or to some detail within it, re- flect a political and economic point of view. The Marxists, however, were in- correct in thinking that they had ex- hausted the meaning of symbols. They were right in saying that no symbol, religious or otherwise, can be appreci- ated adequately apart from its social context. In the light of this awareness it can be recognized that much that passes for religious discussion is a rationaliza- tion of the prevailing social order or else a mild reforming attitude toward it which does not question its underlying presuppositions. It cannot be denied that many of the public utterances of American Christen- dom-both Protestant and Roman Cath- olic-tend to rationalize a bourgeois culture, the capitalist system of political economy, and an individualist concep- tion of morality. This is one reason why so little official religious thought under- stands the dynamic nature of the modern social crisis, which is much deeper than the conflict between communism and the West. When what passes for theology is simply the explanation of symbols which serve no vital purpose in making life meaningful for men and women, people are either left in a kind of vacuum or they are forced to define their lives by some substitute religion. When theology is serving a creative purpose, however, it is because its terms make it possible for men and women to see their actual ex- perience in a meaningful perspective, so that they can make adequate decisions and act on them. VI. THE TEST OF RELEVANCE Religious symbols are meant to be relevant to the social situation in which the men who use them live. If they are not relevant or if they become gradually disconnected from the living issues which men and women are facing, they lose their vitality and can no longer fulfil their functions. The English Christian Socialists of a century ago discovered this to be true. The group in Anglican- ism, influenced by the authors of Lux mundi (I889), made a deliberate and systematic attempt to recover such rele- vance. Canon Scott Holland's phrase, "The more I think about the Incarna- tion the more I am concerned about drains," points precisely to this issue. The way men understand their predic- ament is always conditioned by the cul- tural situation in which they live. While certain basic problems, such as that of the will to power or the drive for secu- rity, are perennial in human nature; the forms they take and the way they are channeled are the result of complex so- cial factors. Nobody ever deals with these problems in a pure form but al- ways as they arise in concrete political economic, and social situations. As civilization evolves, the way men un- derstand their ordinary problems of in- dividual and social adjustment has to change or they will be left floundering. It is interesting to realize that language evolves along with technology and other social factors in order that men may be able to describe their relationship to the real world of which they are a part. If language did not evolve, men would find themselves unable to articulate their experience. Religious symbols deal with the most basic of all human needs, that of making 255</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION experience meaningful and purposeful, and this problem is a constant in human history. But, although the problem must be dealt with somehow by every man who ever lives, the symbols he has in- herited may not help him very much. They certainly cannot be counted on to produce automatic results in one genera- tion just because they have been ade- quate in another. Certain symbols have a significance which transcends the so- cial flux, but even then their relationship to the historical situation has to be made clear and concrete if their continuing val- ue is to be appreciated. Other symbols are obviously so time-conditioned as to be useless in other situations. The test of relevance is whether the religious symbols which are available actually enable men and women to un- derstand their basic religious needs in the setting of the real historical situation where they are. If they do not do this, men are either left helpless and confused or they are forced to use some other reli- gious structure as the framework within which to face their problems. In our modern world the underlying religious questions are strongly condi- tioned by the dilemma of modern civili- zation, which might be described as the uncertain significance of man in a world where the logic of history moves in the direction of a collectivist society, re- gardless of differing political methods of administration, and where the tradition which he has inherited is one of individ- ualist opportunity and responsibility. In other words, the prevailing social tradi- tion and current facts do not fit very well, and many people are uncertain as to what life means. This problem provides a very real test of the relevance of religious symbols, because men have no choice but to meet the problem; they have only a choice of the symbols with which they may try to interpret it and live within it. The task of theology, therefore, is one of insuring the relevance of religious sym- bols by relating the constant insights of faith to the realities of a changing world, so that real men who are caught within history may be able to deal with their underlying religious issues and so both transcend the immediate historical sit- uation and also live creatively within it. Only when the task of theology is put this way is its importance made clear. To relate the symbols by which men describe their destiny to the real world in which they live so that their descrip- tion of life's meaning enables them to find meaning and purpose in and through real problems is the most important of all intellectual tasks. VII. THE TASK OF THEOLOGY On the other hand, no set of religious symbols, Christian or otherwise, can be limited simply by the prevailing social situation, no matter how relevant the terms may be. If it becomes limited it loses its religious function. The observa- tion that experience is not self-explana- tory denotes the fact that no person can find himself in perfect harmony with his setting, even though he may be extra- ordinarily well adjusted to it. No person can be so completely satisfied with the present that no comparison for the better has meaning. Everyone has his hopes, no matter how trivial or how ex- treme they may be, and his hopes are part of his total relationship to his world. Therefore, religious symbols must not only be relevant to the immediate situation if they are to have vitality, they must also transcend it somehow. They must give those who use the sym- bols a basis for dealing with the inade- quacies they feel to exist in their world. The task of theology therefore must include not only that of helping men de- 256</page><page sequence="9">THE TASK OF THEOLOGY scribe their relationship to history so as to deal with the problem of meaning and purpose in the concrete but also that of providing a focus for the transcendence of the history men know themselves to have, so that this transcendence will not be a flight from reality but rather will provide a perspective for living. Men use their symbols religiously, not by speculating about the universe, but by employing them in the process of making actual decisions. One does not have a religion first and then apply it to the life he lives. One discovers his faith by living. There is no other way. To separate between symbols and decisions is to make religion abstract (which is precisely what the modern assumption that religion is a department does). It is also to make religion unrelated to the real problems of home, office, commu- nity, and world which everyone faces. In the light of this awareness, it will be seen that it is quite possible (and is often the case) for people to think that they are holding one set of symbols but to be living actually by another. The faith by which a man lives and the life he lives are obverse and reverse of each other. Neither makes sense without the other. When one takes into account the fact that a great many church members ac- tually find their church participation to be one of life's extras-compared with the demands of their homes and offices and often as compared with their recrea- tion-it would indicate that their real religion is something other than that of the official fellowship. It is not that they make no decisions. They are making them all the time. It is rather that the faith they define in their decisions has no consciously Christian orientation, while the faith of the churches, which they may support rather generously in a finan- cial way, is really peripheral. It is only when one appreciates the premises from which another works that one is able to discuss his conclusions with him. Christianity is actually a reli- gion. To those who live by it seriously, it is not a faith which can be compared with other faiths as if man's religion were simply an elective. As a matter of fact, no one regards the religion by which he actually lives as a free matter of choice. He can only associate this idea of selecting between possibilities to religion when he regards religion itself as a de- partment. The meaning of one's own life, after all, can hardly be a matter of indifference. It can scarcely be consid- ered with cold objectivity. Yet, from another point of view, awareness of the function of religion it- self is a necessary presupposition to dis- cussing Christianity as a living faith. Christianity justifies itself, if it does, by fulfilling the function of religion more adequately than other faiths, not in terms of intellectual comparison, but in terms of the kind of decisions men who live by it are enabled to make in life's real problems. This is the only real basis for any convincing Christian apologetic. Christianity, however, like any other faith, runs the continual danger of hav- ing shadow and substance confused and of having its premises taken for granted without being appreciated. The task of theology, therefore, is to keep the sym- bols vital and strong. The task of the- ology is to explain the relationship of these symbols to man's understanding of the meaning of his own life. The task of theology is to show continually how the symbols of man's religion both interpret the social situation in which he lives and point beyond it. The task of theology is, above all, to make it possible for men to have the insight and perspective neces- sary to make the best possible decisions in the course of everyday living. 257</page></plain_text>
