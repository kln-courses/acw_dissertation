<plain_text><page sequence="1">POSIDONIUS* By ARTHUR DARBY NOCK i. Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo fama Marcelli: so it was with Posidonius from 1878 for forty years, with no voice raised to the contrary save by A. E. Housman in his caustic asides. Had we not found a figure lesser in dimensions than only Plato or Aristotle, -the principal intellectual influence of two succeeding centuries, the fountainhead of Neoplatonism ? In retrospect the element of exaggeration is clear, and yet the quest must not be counted as labour in vain; for there came of it a great enlargement of the frontiers of scholarship. So in the familiar fable the sons did not find the buried treasure for which they dug, but their digging bore rich fruit. Two instances may suffice: the work of Jaeger and Gronau on Nemesius and the Cappadocians, and the study of elevated and pictorial style given by G. Rudberg in his Forschungen zu Poseidonios. In i9i8 J. F. Dobson published in CQ 'The Posidonius Myth': after this important critique, Roger M. Jones in Cl.Phil. 19Z3, I926, I932 and (with H. Cherniss) in AJPhilol. I933, and L. Edelstein ibid., i936, gave closely reasoned arguments not only against what had become the vulgata but also against the new reconstruction advanced by K. Reinhardt.' For the discussion as a whole we have now an invaluable guide in Reinhardt's article in P-W xxii (with much the clearest statement of his own position) 2 for Stoicism in general we are fortunate indeed in having also Die Stoa of M. Pohlenz, a masterpiece of brilliant, judicious and generous scholarship and understanding.3 In what follows I seek only to state about Posidonius as an individual and his impact on society and the history of thought and religion in general certain things which seem to me to be reasonably assured. For his logic and for various other aspects of his work the reader should turn to the P-W article, to Pohlenz, and to Edelstein's paper.4 The capacity of the East to produce mirages is not limited to the field of physical phenomena: one of them is the idea that since Posidonius was born at Apamea in Syria, he had some closeness to an imagined Oriental mysticism-and I emphasize the word ' imagined'. If Zeno was bilingual, that fact may have sharpened his interest in language as the vehicle of thought: otherwise Stoicism is from beginning to end a purely Greek phenomenon. In Stoicism substantial individual divergences were common; the divergences of Posidonius show on the one hand the Greek power of observation, and, on the other, a partial return from Chrysippus to Plato. z. A wealthy Apamean grew up in a Hellenic milieu: and the adopted home of Posidonius was Rhodes, which (unlike Apamea: F z) showed in an outstanding degree the old civic virtues. It was the eminent Rhodian Panaetius who was his teacher. Concerning neither of them would you have raised the question si sciret regibus uti: each dealt with the great ones of the world on a basis of mutual respect. Could anything be more indicative than Cicero's sending to Posidonius a work in Greek on his annus mirabilis with a request that the philosopher should provide a more polished treatment and receiving the reply 'non modo non excitatum esse ad scribendum sed etiam plane perterritum' (Ad Att. ii, I, 2) ? No one would have asked Chrysippus to attempt a piece of fine writing, and, if he had, the reply would undoubtedly have been gauche. Remember again the deference shown to Posidonius by Pompey 5; our Stoic had a standing almost like that of Goethe. Widely travelled, he knew what was to be known, he sought to know more, and he brought a vivid individuality to bear on all things. He was philosopher and stylist, * An abridged form of these remarks was part of my Gifford Lectures at Aberdeen in May, 1946, and a fuller form was presented to the Joint Meeting at Cambridge in August, 1958. My warmest thanks are due to my hosts on both occasions, as also to H. Cherniss, G. S. Kirk, F. H. Sandbach, Z. Stewart, and F. R. Walton for generous aid. 1 In particular, Jones showed that certain ideas attributed to Posidonius were taken from Plato direct or belonged to what Festugiere has called 'philosophic koine '. 2 cf.

There is room for doubt as to the details of his teaching, but no uncertainty as to his personality with its richness and vigour. In thought as in life he had much in common with Panaetius. Both alike maintained the moral dignity of the Stoic ideal while remaining ready to jettison paradox and to assimilate valuable ideas from outside. Both had, like Cleanthes and Diogenes of Babylon, a feeling for literary form. Both might have had some measure of sympathy with the inter- locutor in Cicero who remarked of Chrysippus, ' qui suo quodam more loquitur, ut omnia verborum momentis, non rerum ponderibus examinet.' 6 Both owed much to Plato, and both rejected the Chrysippean view that emotions are simply errors of judgment.7 3. We are lucky to know how Posidonius looked to Strabo, an avowed Stoic with a similar concern for history and geography; Strabo had moreover free access to his writings on those topics. He calls him (p. 753), 'the most learned of philosophers in our time ' (and for Strabo, unlike Heraclitus, that was praise), yet likes to point out what he regards as his mistakes. Strabo shows this attitude towards other forerunners, but he has perhaps an element of school feeling against a Stoic who had the fatal gift of brilliance: certainly his comment on the account given by Posidonius of the rich silver mines in Spain is hostile (p. 146 f.): ' P. in praising the quantity and the excellence of these ores, does not refrain from his usual oratory no, his enthusiasm matches them with its hyperboles (or, matches their extravagance). ... 8 This too adds to our picture of the man, as do (p. 102), ' a master of demonstration and a philosopher, one who might almost be called a claimant for highest honours ' (a statement made to underline what Strabo regarded as the monstrosity of his crediting the story of Eudoxus' voyage) and (p. 104), ' he has a strong element of the explanatory (acdioAoytK6v) and Aristotelian which our people (the Stoics) avoid because of the obscurity of causes ' (S. is refusing to go into what P. said on physical as distinct from geographical questions). More notable and entirely wholehearted is the testimony of Galen, who not only speaks of him as brought up in geometry and more accustomed than other Stoics to follow the results of demonstrations,9 but also twice calls him the most scientific (Err1Tlcrrito0V1KcbTaTo&amp;) of the Stoics. On one of these occasions he remarks that, whereas other Stoics are prepared to betray their fatherland rather than their dogmas, Posidonius is prepared to betray the Stoic school rather than truth.10 Can we imagine a more striking tribute from one who was both the leading clinician of his time and also ' nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri '? Posidonius is thus credited with an interest in explanations, with an Aristotelian tendency, with width of knowledge, with logical method, and with enthusiasm. We can accept all these predicates, giving our own sense to ' enthusiasm '. In a way this is the word for Posidonius, where decorum is the word for Panaetius. It here connotes no sentimentalism or ' Schwiirmerei ' or ' romantische Verwirrung ', but rather the ' legitimate rhetoric' of one for whom man's scale included the overtones of Homer and Pythagoras as well as the syllogisms of Chrysippus and the lower exigencies of the emotional and physical self. To the features noted by Strabo we should add a concern with Plato in general and the Timaeus in particular, and a deep and early interest in the work of Polybius. 6 Rep. iII, I2. 7 What Diog. Bab. says on music, fr. 69 (Stoicoruna Vet. Frag. III, p. 227), and its production of psycho- logical states suggests that his view of the emotions was not simply intellectualist. To be sure, Chrysippus (ibid. no. 390) allows that a sufficiently strong impulse can cause the individual to reject the guidance of reason ; cf. Pohlenz i, I43 ff. (The psychology of Panaetius is far less well attested than that of Posidonius, but cf. Pohlenz, P-W XVIII, iii, 433.) 8 It might be held that your style should match your topic (Norden, Kunstprosa 285), but with alVEVOOVoiCa cf. p.lU O-ITfp T6V icap6v bvOou6aa in Lucian, Quom. hist. 58 and Nock, Coniectanea Neotestamentica, xi, I69 if.

Hippocr. et Plat. p. 362, Muller (v, 3goK). For Galen geometrical proofs were the best: cf. Scr. min. ii, ii6 f. (XIX, 40K). The Stoic Dionysius of Cyrene had been celebrated as a geometer (v. Arnim, P-W v, 974). 10 Scr. min. II, 77 f. (IV, 8i9K); Plac. 653M (652K)-again with reference to P.'s geometrical training. For the principle cf. Galen VII, 825 f.

Walzer, Galen on Jews and Christians 41 f.</page><page sequence="3">POSIDONIUS 3 4. Strabo apart, why should we speak of ' an Aristotelian tendency' 11 in Posidotnius ? It is because, however strong his theoretical convictions were, the individual facts over a very large area mattered to him in themselves; he could see the trees as well as the wood. His range was immense: he was trained in geometry; he wrote extensively on history and geography, he observed terrestrial phenomena and reasoned on his observations, and he was much concerned with celestial phenomena. He wrote, again, about the science of war,12 whereas most earlier Stoics would have been interested only in the theoretical assertion that the Wise Man would be the perfect general; he was furthermore interested in language and style. Greek philosophy had begun as the quest for a unifying principle that might explain phenomena. If the facts were too few, if there was nothing like enough desire to verify and increase the supply of them, if the hypotheses were oversimplified, that does not detract from the greatness of the ideal. The rediscovery of extensive remains of Democritus might give us some surprises. After Theophrastus and Strato philosophers seem to have shown less interest in science as such-which means that, apart from medical studies and the Museum at Alexandria, science probably had little chance of anything like the continuity of philosophic schools.13 The Stoa had much to say on natural phenomena; but, as Pohlenz puts it (I, 82), ' Ein eigenes naturwissenschaftliches Interesse leitete die Stoiker dabei aber nicht. Nur die vernunftgemasse Gestaltung und die Wohlbegriindetheit aller Phainomene wollten sie erweisen.' Posidonius not only retained but reinforced the teleology of the Stoa; yet in his theory he shows something more, and we can call him both a philosopher of science and a scientist. There is a fragment in Simplicius (In Phys. p. 291 f. Diels), thus summarized by Edelstein (1936, 321), ' All the sciences are based on philosophical presuppositions which cannot ultimately be proved by science.' As for his science, we know that he constructed a model of the celestial globe 14 and made direct observations. When at Cadiz (F 45) he investigated the phenomena said to be associated with the setting of the sun (most others would have been content with reports), and, what is infinitely more significant, made a careful and comparative study of tidal phenomena (F 8I ff.), on which he produced an important theory; W. Capelle, P-W Supp. VII, 213, may well be right in supposing that he went to Cadiz precisely in order to study the tides-and such a journey was no mean undertaking. On his way back he noted the seasonal character of the winds which delayed him (F 46). He also made an optical observation on the rainbow, and may be credited with one modest experiment.", He had an eye for things, however remote from his theoretical concerns; a Humboldt, not a Newton. So he remarked (F 73) the peculiarities of the Libyan monkeys and (F 55) the Celtic habit of nailing on their portals the skulls of their enemies, a practice which he at first found trying. Apart from these rare and precious pieces of observation, Posidonius collected evidence of all sorts in the Peripatetic way from books. One may well feel with Tarn 16 that he was too hospitable to assertions, however ill-founded, which appeared to confirm certain convictions of his own. Yet, where verification was not possible, there was a value in recording all that could be recorded: and, since a man must be judged by the norms of criticism used in his world, it is fair to observe that Posidonius measured up to the standards of Galen-and not every one did."7 11 To Nicolaus of Damascus (goF, 132) the attraction of Aristotle was his breadth of education. Cf. in general K. 0. Brink, P-W Supp. vii, 927, and ibid. 930, on Peripatetics in Rhodes. 12 cf. Arrian, Tact. I ; it is commonly thought that the tactical writer Asclepiodotus was a philoso- phic pupil of his cited by Sen., NQ passim. 13 cf. E. R. Dodds, Greeks and the Irrational 267.

K) of the work of the grammarian Pamphilus on herbs- with its magic invocations, its quotations from the Egyptian Hermes, and (796) 'Pamphilus who had never even in a dream seen the plants whose shapes he sets about describing' (cf. XII, 3iK, and A. J. Festugiere, Revelation I, 139, 197; Wendel, P-W XVIII, iii, 344 f.).</page><page sequence="4">4 ARTHUR DARBY NOCK As for personal convictions, I am thinking primarily of the 'vitalistic' view of the universe which he clearly seems to have held and which Reinhardt has emphasized.18 For Chrysippus, as for Plato, the universe was a ;cjov, a living creature. Yet, as Leeman observed, for Posidonius this was not a philosophic construction but an experience.19 Within the continuum of life man occupied a special place (p. I3), and characteristically Posidonius thought of men and not simply of man. He was a great ethnographer and, like his teacher Panaetius (and Chrysippus earlier),20 he busied himself (e.g. F I02, I05) with speculations such as Greeks had pursued since the fifth century on the effect of physical environment on men's characters and dispositions. And it was probably through Panaetius that he was introduced early in life to the writings of Polybius. 5. History is defined by a rhetorician as ' philosophy by examples i21 and philosophers turned freely to history as to poetry for examples of virtue and vice, their reward and punishment or neglect. Peripatetics wrote biographies and cultural history. Strabo, whose Stoicism has been mentioned earlier, expresses the belief (i, I, 23, p. I3) that his own historical work was of service to moral and political philosophy. But if Strabo was a professed Stoic, Posidonius was a professional Stoic: and he is the only notable professional philosopher of antiquity known to have written a monumental account of recent history. It is quoted as ' Histories Suidas has an instructive title, ' History after Polybius.' That is to say, it was a sequel to the Achaean statesman's world history which started with the outbreak of the First Punic War in 264 B.C. Polybius picked up the story where Timaeus ended, but without any feeling of sympathetic rapport: far from that. In fact, since within the framework of world history his principal theme was the rise of Rome to supreme power, the date chosen was almost inevitable; the only alternative would have been the landing of Pyrrhus, and that was after all the Vorspiel, not the drama. The relation of Posidonius to Polybius was quite different. We must remember various aspects of Polybius. He wrote about the torrid zone, and again in his History he laid the greatest emphasis on the historian's need of precise geographic knowledge and first- hand familiarity with the terrain of the events which he was describing. He too was interested in ' causes ' (e.g. xxxvi, I7) ; incidentally, he also wrote on tactics (Ix, Zo). Above all, he made a voyage of exploration along the coast of West Africa and travelled in Africa, Gaul, and Spain. Capelle, Geistige Arbeit IV (I937), no. xi, 8, suggested that his voyage inspired that of Posidonius: may it not be that his activity did in a wider sense fire the imagination of this brilliant pupil of Panaetius ? And was not Panaetius his close friend and associate in the intimacy of the Scipionic circle ? The point is the more important since a new work of the bulk of the History of Polybius, with no meretricious charms, could not be expected to have any wide dissemination in the Greek world. For generations it was probably better known to Romans; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, himself a copious historian of the past of Rome, mentions Polybius (De comp. verb. 4, 30) among writers whom no one can read through; surely Dionysius had not. Posidonius could criticize his predecessor; F 5 I comments with sarcasm on the statement that Tiberius Gracchus had destroyed 300 cities (in Celtiberia), ' he did this to gratify Gracchus, calling the towers cities, just as they do in triumphal processions.' His own sequel showed an intense interest in human behaviour and a great though not dispassionate power of describing it. We see this in a number of vivid vignettes, e.g. (F io) on the Syrian cities (instructively like Polyb. XXXIV, I4 on Alexandria), (F 5, IZ) Parthian court etiquette, and so forth: above all (F 36) the description of the Peripatetic agitator Athenion and his activity at Athens in support of Mithridates, with his reference to the prophecies promising him rule over the world (which Posidonius clearly regarded as humbug; F 53, 90 show that he was not uncritical in such matters). Posidonius would hardly have written so extensive a historical work had he not deemed it a task appropriate for a philosopher. Reinhardt indeed ascribed to him the sentiment 18 cf. Pohlenz I, 2I5 * II, I07. 19 A. D. Leeman, Gnomon XXIV, 1952, 280. The fact that Posidonius (D.L. VII, 138) described the universe as a ' system composed of heaven and earth and the natures in them or again as a system composed of gods and men and all that is created for their sake ' does not tell against this, since systema was used to describe a living organism. 20 SIF ii, 950. 21 [D. Hal.] Ars rhet. xi, 2.</page><page sequence="5">POSIDONIUS 5 expressed by Diodorus Siculus in the preface to his Historical Library (i, I, 3), that writers who have set themselves to bring into a single framework all mankind (who, though akin to one another, are separated by space and time) have become, so to speak, servants of divine Providence. Providence, he says, ordered the stars and men's natures in a joint relationship of correspondence, and controls them on their appointed course: such historians in recording the affairs of the world as though of one city have made of their treatises a single record and communal centre for things done. Reinhardt remarked that this declaration could be regarded as a pendant to what Polybius (I, 4, i) said about the writing of universal history as an obligation imposed by the turn of events. In fairness I should add that other scholars have agreed as far as the substance of what Diodorus says. But that at least the wording must be Diodorean has been urged by J. Palm in his penetrating study of the language of Diodorus 22; I should go further and endorse the conclusion of Margrit Kunz, ' Das Hauptprooemium ist wohl Diodor selbst.'23 Firstly, the declaration fits the purpose of Diodorus and his compilation, reaching as it did from the dimly descried beginnings of life to the present. It would not fit the account by Posidonius of some sixty years of recent history, with events separated widely in space but not (save for what an excursus might include) in time. Secondly, you may be disposed to think that the sentiment is too good for Diodorus, and I admit that such was my earlier impression: and certainly if it was borrowed from a philosopher, Posidonius is the only known possibility. Now (and this also is subjective), I have come to feel that it is the proem style of a small man with pretensions, like Artemidorus and Vettius Valens,24 and with a tinge of Stoicism. Somehow it recalls ' L'art est un sacerdoce ', as uttered by the conventional young man who wishes to join the cheerful raffish group of Murger's Bohemians; an ancient parallel would be the poems which Diogenes Laertius so self- consciously introduces (IV, 55 ff. on Bion is a good example). 6. From Herodotus onwards ancient historians were fond of digressions 25 and one type was the retrospect giving the antecedents of the situation of the moment: a brief and brilliant example is Tac., Hist. III, 72, on the occasion of the burning of the Capitoline Temple. The sketch of Jewish history with which Tacitus opened the fifth book of his Histories may well have had a forerunner in Posidonius: this could have been introduced on the occasion of some clash between the Hasmonaeans and the waning power of the Seleucids,26 or it might conceivably have been inserted in his monograph on Pompey. It is a reasonable conjecture, well argued by Reinhardt, that the substance of this is preserved in Strabo's excursus on early Judaism (xvi, 2, 35 ff. ; pp. 760 ff. He refers to it in XVII, 2, 5, p 824) This tells how an Egyptian priest named Moses left his land because he disapproved of established ways and many, honouring that which is divine, left with him. Moses approved neither Egyptian animal-cult nor Greek anthropomorphism and held that the term God should be applied only to what encompasses all of us and earth and sea, what we call heaven, the universe, the nature of existing things, and that God should not be represented in the likeness of anything in our midst. There should be established a precinct and a sanctuary without an idol; those with a gift for good dreams should sleep there to obtain revelations both for themselves and for others; the virtuous might always expect blessings or signs. Not a few intelligent men followed Moses and he led them to Jerusalem, a strong site in poor territory; it was to be protected not by arms but by worship and the divinity. Moses promised to give them a cultus free from extravagant costs and ecstatic possession and other absurdities, and so all the people around flocked to him and he established a sizeable empire. A state of justice and piety continued for generations till first superstitious men and then tyrannical men came to the priesthood. The former were responsible for dietary laws, circumcision, etc., and the latter for aggression on neighbouring territories: nevertheless, the sanctuary continued to inspire reverence.

Honigmann, P-W ivA io8 f.</page><page sequence="6">6 ARTHUR DARBY NOCK and barbarian alike, is based on a generally binding ordinance, and among the ancients this ordinance commonly rested on divine authority; hence the esteem in which oracles and prophets were held. Moses was one of the prophets with authority, and so were his successors, in spite of their falling off. This passage is remarkable for content and tone alike. What distinguished the Jews from other peoples was now common knowledge; it here gives occasion for general reflections on social evolution, in which the religious factor receives special emphasis. The ascription to non-Greeks of a feeling against anthropomorphism is familiar from Herodotus I, I3I and became something of an ethnographic commonplace.27 While the idea of a deterioration in religious practice appears in the arguments of Theophrastus (as preserved in Porph. Abst.) against animal sacrifice, the significant parallel is what Augustine quotes from Varro (Civ.D. IV, 3): dicit etiam idem auctor [i.e. Varro] acutissimus atque doctissimus, quod hi soli ei videantur animadvertisse quid esset deus, qui crediderunt eum esse animam motu ac ratione mundum gubernantem ... dicit etiam antiquos Romanos plus annos centum et septuaginta deos sine simulacro coluisse. ' quod si adhuc ', inquit, ' mansisset, castius dei observarentur '. cui sententiae suae testem adhibet inter cetera etiam gentem Iudaeam; nec dubitat eum locum ita concludere, ut dicat, qui primi simulacra deorum populis posuerunt, eos civitatibus suis et metum dempsisse et errorem addidisse. Augustine elsewhere refers to Varro's equation of the Jewish God with Juppiter.28 So Judaism represents an ideal original phase of belief, and inter cetera does not prove but strongly suggests that Varro adduced analogies from other peoples. So does our passage, apropos of the religious basis of authority, and, though Moses is lacking, Cicero, Div. I, 87 ff. is parallel. Now Seneca, Ep. 94, 38, quotes the criticism which Posidonius made of the preambles to laws prescribed by Plato: (sc. lex) ' velut emissa divinitus vox sit.' This could be pure metaphor, like the description of various utterances as oracular,29 but may show a similar view of government. Certainly the emphasis on direct revelation in dreams fits Posidonius (p. 9), and so, as we shall see, does the attitude towards early times. Moreover, a man born at Apamea could have had his reasons for drawing a bitter contrast between ideal and contemporary Judaism: once upon a time neighbouring peoples flocked to join the Jewish state, now circumcision or exile is imposed upon Idumaeans and Ituraeans. The writer has leapt lightly over the intervening centuries; Samuel, if known, would have illustrated the concept of the religious basis of authority. Yet it is to be remembered that Gentile knowledge of Jewish tradition was limited to the Creation story and garbled versions of the Exodus-except later for polemists against Christianity and in the first century for Alexander Polyhistor, and of him it is to be remarked both that he may well have written too late to be available to Posidonius and that, outside Christian authors, there is hardly any trace of acquaintance with what he wrote on Jews and Chaldaeans.30 Moses is represented as acting from a sincere conviction described with sympathy, not prudentially like the social planners of the Sisyphus of Critias or of Polybius VI, 56.31 How are we to account for this supposed conviction? Now Sextus Empiricus, 27 cf. A. Schroeder, De ethnographiae antiquae locis quibusdam communibus observationes (Diss. Halle, I92I), 2 ff. 28 Ant. rer. div. p. I9, ed. Agahd (Fleck. _Jahrb. Supp. xxiv). Varro, moreover, knew the name Iao (J. Lyd. Mens. IV, 53, p. iio f. Wiunsch: 6 'Pcouaios B&amp;ppcov rlEpi aonToi (the god of the Hebrews) boiaAapcbv naty -rrap&amp; Xa8aiois ?v -Tois VuaIKOiS aOr6v M'ywea&amp; 'I6co &amp;vri roy c)pY Vo1vTOV Ti) DOW1KCOV yACaain, c6s ilaiv 'Epgvvios. Has not something dropped out, e.g. 6 a-rwv before avri ? On the reference to Philo Byblius cf. H. Lewy, Chaldaean Oracles [Rech. arch. phil. hist., Inst. fr. arch. orient. xiii], 409, n. 32). Presumably Varro is using the term ' Chaldaeans' loosely and referring to the Jews: cf. Norden, Festgabe Harnack 299. (A fragment in Funaioli, Gramm. rom. frag. I, I83, no. i, shows his interest in the names of the letters of the 'Chaldaean' alphabet). Diod. Sic. i, 94, 2, speaks of Iao as the god to whom Moses ascribed his laws: the context is like our passage, and gives Zathraustes and Zalmoxis as analogues, but leaves it an open question whether such men believed that an idea which would benefit humanity was wondrous and wholly divine or alternatively acted from prudential considerations. Jacoby iiiC, 665; Anh. II9, p. 244, prints much of the Egyptian material in this and the following chapter as ' (= Poseidonios ?) '. 29 cf. Harv. Theol. Rev. xxxiii, I940, 3I3 f. 30 cf. Jacoby iiiA, on 273 (Komm. 248 ff., 257). The historical writings of Berossus and Manetho are known to us almost entirely through Jewish and Christian authors. 31 cf. Wolfgang Schmid, Ethica Epicurea 66.</page><page sequence="7">POSIDONIUS 7 Adv.Phys. I, 28, preserves a theory of 'some of the later Stoics' to the effect that the first men, those sprung from earth, were much superior to present-day men in intelligence: these heroes possessed, as it were, an extra sense, their sharpness of mind, and fixed their attention on the divine nature, and apprehended certain powers of gods. The idea that ' some of the later Stoics ' 32 here means Posidonius is supported by Seneca, Ep. 90, a letter written with explicit reference to his views of cultural development. Seneca accepts the idea that the original rulers were sages; he says as much of the lawgivers who did their work after the tyrannical regimes which succeeded monarchy and mentions Solon, etc. He does, however, oppose the idea that the original sages invented the useful arts (how to build houses, grind corn, make the wheel-not indeed the arts which were the handmaids of the luxury which Posidonius deplored. Here we see how Posidonius rose above the superiority complex in relation to anything technological which could mark the Greek thinker). At the end he turns around and denies that primitive men were wise, but continues (44), ' non tamen negaverim fuisse alti spiritus viros et, ut ita dicam, a dis recentes ' (cf. ? 4). Rightly or wrongly, I take ' ut ita dicam ' to be an apology for the boldness of the Latin phrase (common as was recens a), and not for that of the idea. If so, he means, ' On this I agree with what Posidonius says,' and Posidonius was using the old and popular concept ' those near to the gods '. 3 On the Stoic theory of periodic destructions the fire purged all things (Stoicorum Vet. Frag. II, I I74) and men reappeared in new if short-lived innocence (Sen., NQ III, 30, 8): but this did not necessarily carry with it anything like the idealization which we find in this passage of Seneca and in the remarks of Dio of Prusa to which we come. Once more we seem to be finding Stoicism 'in a new key'. The origin of religious beliefs was discussed from the Presocratics onwards, and the contemplation of the sky and the heavenly bodies was thought to offer an explanation.34 The logioi of Democritus B 30 (II, 15I, Diels-Kranz) who stretched up their hands to the air and intuitively recognized Zeus have a distinct resemblance to the early sages in Sextus. There indeed the idea of the gods is clearly not an inference from data which might have been interpreted otherwise or might have been ignored, but rather the fruit of a special power of perception. In Dio of Prusa XII, 27 if. (another text frequently brought into the discussion) the idea of the divine arises from the contemplation of the universe, but he speaks of the earliest men (28) as ' not living dispersed by themselves and far away from the divine or outside the divine', and this suggests intuition rather than inference. Dio's account of original revelation is followed by a sympathetic treatment of the subsequent development of myth and law as building upon the natural and original foundation, without which they could not have acquired force.35 The trichotomy of religion as natural, mythical and civic was familiar: Dio added a new category, artistic, which was put forth as a novelty and led up to the climax, the apologia pro arte sua of Phidias. Moses cannot properly be called a primitive, and he is represented as reacting against Egyptian practice: yet in the excursus he is put on a level with other figures exercising authority in early times. The costly,36 ecstatic and strange practices which he deprecated look very like what his successors introduced. For Posidonius, as I see him, all that in Dio was added by poetry, law and art would represent a deterioration. He would not, any more 32 The phrase is indeed used by Clem. Al., Strom. II, 2I, I29, p. I83 St. for a view distinguished from that of Posidonius. 33 cf. Plat., Rep. 39iE, Critias I2iA, Phileb. i6C, Leg. 948B: Dicaearch. ap. Porph., Abst. IV, 2: Cic., Leg.

Havelock, Liberal Temper in Greek Politics 438, s.v. Religion. Man's kinship with the divine in Plat., Prot. 322A is a very attenu- ated relationship ; after all, in Pind., Nem. vi, i ff. the fact that gods and men share one mother brings anything but closeness. 35 Note 6o, the denial that it would have been better if there had never been images, which is almost like an answer to criticism such as that of the Moses excursus (to which Dio approximated in 27, where he speaks of the original inborn idea of divinity as being 'without a mortal teacher and the deceit of a mystagogos '). In 40 he speaks of some poets and lawgivers as expounding things rightly and in harmony with truth and the (innate) concepts, and others as going astray on certain points. For a drastic statement cf. the gnomic sentiment discussed by J. and L. Robert, Bull. ipigr. 240 in Rev. it. gr. Lxiv, 1951, 210, with its blunt rejection of all representations. 36 cf.

Boyance postulates a Peripatetic source, on grounds which seem to me very strong.37 Such considerations tell in favour of ascribing the excursus to Posidonius, and the idea has won marked acceptance. On the other hand, W. Aly, who has an intimate familiarity with Strabo's style and method of composition, has argued that the passage as a whole is closely related to Hecataeus-not indeed taken directly from him: ' es ist moglich, dass der unbekannte Epitomator Hekataios mit den Augen eines Poseidoniosschiilers gelesen hat.' 38 For my own part, I regard it as possible that it is in substance borrowed from Posidonius 39 and think that at the least it reflects ideas which he had on religion. Can it be that he did in effect maintain that, whatever the present behaviour of the Jews, their religion, like that of others, had a good start, and still kept its hold ? Certainly Varro shows that a philosophic Gentile, born within two decades of Posidonius, could speak of Jewish belief with sympathy and understanding. Nevertheless, the excursus is surprising in its degree of sympathy. Those who followed Moses were 'not a few intelligent men'; but the astounding feature of the story is that the Exodus is represented as the voluntary departure of an elite for idealistic reasons. In all other Gentile sources save Celsus it is an expulsion; and Celsus had a special reason for treating the Jews as rebellious and fugitive Egyptians.40 May it be that the excursus reproduces the creation of a Jew familiar with the ideas of Posidonius, a Jew whose Hellenization was not, like Philo's, controlled by an overpowering loyalty to Scripture ? Such a Jew might have resented legalism on the one hand 41 and Hasmonaean militancy on the other. Artapanus had claimed that Moses was responsible for various salient features of Egyptian civilization and religion; and the statement in Christian writers that the cult of Sarapis was homage to the dead Joseph must come from a Jewish source.42 Could there not have been a Jew who accepted the alien view that the Jews were originally Egyptians and who preferred descent from a people of immemorial culture to descent from ' a Syrian ready to perish ' (Deut. 26, 5) ? 43 Unlike Gentiles, he would naturally have been well acquainted with the story of what lay between Moses and the Maccabees, but he might have deliberately produced the schematic simplification which the excursus shows: Das Wesen des J7udentums, in a comparative setting. Such a treatment of the theme might have reached Strabo in some form, written or oral. An informed Jew, of the type postulated, would have 37 Le culte des Muses 209 ff. (E. Schwartz, P-W I, 2874, had suggested that the source was Apollodorus writing in a manner very close to Aristotle's observa- tions). On the other side, be it remembered that Wilamowitz, Glaube II, 4I6, n. i, warmly approved Reinhardt's attribution on stylistic grounds. R. Philippson, P-W XIX, 2457 f. suggested that there is criticism of Posidonius in Philod., Mus.; but cf. A. J. Neubecker, Die Bewertung d. Musik bei Stoikern u. Epikureern (D. Akad. Berlin, Inst. gr.-r6m, Alt., Arbeitsgruppe f. hellenistisch-rdmische Philosophie v, I956), 88. Philodemus seems wholly or almost wholly ignorant of Posidonius (cf. n. 70) ; if he were attacking this fierce enemy of his school (cf. D. L. x, 4) would he not name him? 38 Strabonis Geographica iv, i9i ff.; I cite p. 207. (I owe this, as other references, to H. Cherniss.) Aly is right in saying (p. I96) that the definition of God is not that of Posidonius (but cf. n. 47 below on God's substance), but is related to that which is ascribed to the Jews by Hecataeus of Abdera (itself perhaps due to the Jewish habit of using Heaven as a substitute for the name of God): yet it was a definition acceptable to many thoughtful Greeks. As for Decaeneus in the list of prophets, ' in our time' strongly suggests that Strabo added his name ; cf. the fuller treatment, VII, 3, 5, p. 298. 39 Certainly F 69 is not evidence to the contrary ; Joseph., Contra Ap. II, 79, is just mentioning two names quoted by Apion, who might conceivably have been thinking of the remarks attributed to counsellors of Antiochus vii (F IO9). Timagenes ap. Jos., AJ XIII, 3I9, speaks with favour of what Aristobulus did in Ituraea; this tells against his being Strabo's source. 40 ap. Orig., CCels. III, 5; IV, 3 I . Celsus was concerned to represent the Jews as apostates from Egyptian religion, just as he represented the Christians as apostates from Jewish religion. On the expulsion story, cf. L. Finkelstein, Harv. Theol. Rev. xxxvi, 1943, 24 ff. Julius Africanus ap. Eus., Pr. Ev. x, IO, i 6, quotesApion (6i 6F2 Jacoby) as speaking of the revolt (&amp;rroa-roivai) of the Jews. The reference to Herodotus which follows does not encourage confidence in this statement ; in any event cf. Jos., Contra Ap. ii, 8 (J. says that he has refuted the story of the expulsion and that he comes to what Apion has added; 20' the number of those expelled'; I5, 23, the familiar reference to supposed physical defects). Tatian, Ad Gr. 38, says that Ptolemy of Mendes (6iiFI) spoke of the journey of the Jews to what lands they wanted: but no one will take Tatian's word too seriously. 41 cf. V. Tcherikover, Harv. Theol. Rev. LI, I958, 59 ff. on the Letter of Aristeas as directed to Jews and intended to promote intelligent conformity. 42 cf. E. Schiurer, Gesch. jid.V. III, 477 ff.; Th.

XXXV, I942, 292 ff.</page><page sequence="9">POSIDONIUS 9 had no difficulty in making contacts with Gentiles: he would have encountered sympathetic curiosity among cultivated people who wanted to know more about this puzzling phenomenon in their midst. The story of Clearchus about Aristotle's encounter with a Jew who was 'Hellenic not only in language but also in soul' 44 was told as something which could appear credible. Certainly when Hecataeus of Abdera quoted the code of Moses,45 at a time at which there is no reason to suppose the existence of any Greek version of the Old Testament, he must have got his information from talking with a Jew who corresponded to the Persian friends of Herodotus. 7. In the Mosaic phase of Jewish religion, as described in the document which we have been considering, there existed as a religious institution the practice of sleeping in the temple to obtain dreams, presumably dreams conveying direct information and not dreams of the ordinary kind requiring interpretation. Now Cicero (Div. I, 64) quotes Posidonius not only as asserting the divinatory powers of men at point of death but also as stating that there are three ways in which the gods are responsible for men's dreams. First, the mind, by reason of its kinship to the gods, has of itself prevision. Secondly, the air is full of immortal minds bearing what might be called clearly stamped indications of truth. Thirdly the gods themselves hold converse with men in sleep.46 This involves certain ideas about the gods and about the mind; we must consider both., Posidonius defined deity in traditional Stoic terms as a fiery breath, capable of thought, penetrating all that exists, able to take all shapes,47 and the Moses excursus, if regarded as in substance reproducing his views, indicates a lack of sympathy with much polytheistic practice. Yet he admitted an aspect of plurality in the divine 48 and he envisaged the possibility of converse between man and something higher but not wholly other. Now the explicit theism of the early Stoa was serious and yet (save in Cleanthes) emotionally cool: the reverent recognition in the universe of a purposive and pervasive element of divinity, a divinity which could not be capricious, qua cuncta coercet, se quoque lege tenens,49 This divinity was entitled to our reverence and might fitly be approached through the forms of inherited worship. Oracles and in due course astrology were (except to Panaetius) among the evidences for providential activity (cf. Sext., Adv.Phys I, I32). This divinity and its manifestations were free from passions and were not anthropo- morphic; the myths were easily sterilized by allegory. And yet men shared citizenship with the abstract plurality of the gods (Stoicorum Vet. Frag. III, 333 ff.), citizenship in the ' dear city of Zeus ', to use the phrase of Marcus Aurelius (iv, 23). In fact, religious senti- ment in Cleanthes and Epictetus and Marcus outran the logical consequences of Stoicism. Further, while the language of devotion as applied to Zeus is essentially monotheistic, we must remember that to the average Stoic the gods of poetry and art were familiar from early childhood, while the allegorization was something learned later; Chrysippus might be capable of a grim consistency, Panaetius of an urbane one, but it was not for everybody. When Posidonius distinguished Zeus from fate and made him higher than fate,50 he was perhaps showing sympathy with an idea of divine activity which involved something like individuality. Again, like Hecaton, he allowed that the Wise Man would pray to the gods for blessings (Diog. Laert. vii, I24). The Sage of the earlier Stoa might have uttered prayers or consulted oracles; but there would have been at least the appearance of noblesse oblige, for, like Cato in Lucan Ix, 564 ff., he had nothing to learn from the gods and nothing to desire for himself from them. Now Posidonius abandoned the negative attitude of 44 cf. H. Lewy, ib. XXXI, I938, 205 if. 45 cf. W. Jaeger, Diokles v. Karystos I34 ff.; Fr. Dirlmeier, DLZ. LIX, I938, I834; Nock, Harv. Theol. Rev.

It may well be that he never consulted an oracle or a soothsayer or looked at a horoscope, unless perhaps as a matter of intellectual curiosity and with a personal detachment only less than that with which Horace observed the fortune-tellers in Rome (S. i, 6, 114). Nevertheless, divination was an integral part of the universe as he saw it, with its linkages and with the possibility of a relationship between man and the divine in which something happened, something passed from above to below. Direct communication to the mind was the vital issue, and in considering what Posidonius taught both about such communications and about the mind we have to think of Plato and the Timaeus. Sextus Empiricus reports (AdvLog I, 93), 'Posidonius in expounding the Timaeus of Plato says: as light is apprehended by the lightlike sense of sight, and as sound is apprehended by the airlike quality of hearing, so also the nature of the universe should be apprehended by reason in virtue of its kinship.' We do not have to suppose anything like a formal commentary: to be sure, E'-y?YdeaO, when conjoined with the name of an author or of a book, indicates a work dealing with the actual wording; 51 but it need not mean more than the discussion of individual sentences or passages, just as in Plutarch's Quaest. Plat. and De animae procreatione in Timaeo. The quotation in Sextus is set in the context of Pythagorean theory and the statement which follows on the significance of number may well belong to the Posidonius quotation (as Edelstein suggests, AJPhilol. LVII, 1936, 317, n. 124). Theon of Smyrna, p. 103, ed. Hiller, has preserved something of what Posidonius had to say on the making of soul in Tim. 35B, and the theory of direct divine monitions which we have just been considering may be indebted to Tim. 71. We see, I think, something of the Timaeus again in what Posidonius had to say about man) s internal problems and ultimate ideal. The cause of emotions, that is of disharmony and the unhappy (KaKoSaipovoS) life, is that men fail to be wholly consistent in following the Sacic,uv within them, the Saixcov that is akin to and of like nature with the Power governing the whole universe. Instead at times they turn aside after the lower animal principle and let it run away with them. Those who have failed to see this do not herein give a better explanation of emotions nor do they hold correct opinions about happiness (EC?al,uovia) and conformity. The reason is that they do not perceive that the first point for happiness is to refuse to be led in anything by the irrational, unhappy, godless element in the soul.52 Pohlenz is probably right in regarding this as a modification of traditional Stoicism under the influence of Tim. go. A Chrysippean context in Diog. Laert. vii, 88, includes ' the excellence of the happy (Eii5ah,cov) man and the smooth current of life, when all is done in conformity with the harmony of the 8alfcov in the individual with the will of the Governor of the universe'. Pohlenz comments ' Der etymologische Hinweis auf den Damon in unsrer Brust am Schluss ist wohl erst durch Poseidonios' Einfluss in den 5' For the meaning of tTjyo0vos cf. Sext., AdvMath.

In any event, the direct quotation from Posidonius illustrates his frank recognition of the lower urges in man and his conviction that this is no academic question. For him, as for Socrates, right action requires right understanding; if you suppose that the emotions are just wrong judgments, you will not act correctly.54 There has been much discussion of Seneca, Ep. 92, IO, 'Prima ars (v.1., pars) hominis est ipsa virtus; huic committitur inutilis caro et fluida, receptandis tantum cibis habilis, ut ait Posidonius.' This is not strictly dualistic 55; the context of the remark in Posidonius may have been, like that of the quotation, controversial and directed against hedonistic views,56 or it may have been (as Pohlenz I, 236) homiletical. After all, there is a parallel in Persius ii, 63 (and Persius was brought up on Chrysippean Stoicism), not to mention 'Thou art a small soul carrying a dead body'. It was a natural reaction. The outlook of Posidonius was, as Galen appreciated, realistic. He emphasized individual iOos as showing itself in small children who ex hypothesi could not be credited with the faculty of reasoning. He praised Plato's insistence on appropriate nurture from the womb onwards. He held, again, that evil did not come into us from the outside without having any root in us, as also he held that what we most need is not so much to shun bad men as to seek after those who will cleanse us and prevent the increase of vice in us.58 His concern was not new in the Stoa; Chrysippus had produced a work on the treatment of emotions which would appear to have been practical and detailed.59 But Posidonius found a better framework of interpretation, in his return to Plato-and, as he said, to Pythagoras. 60 Did he in any sense return to Plato on the question of the origin and destiny of the soul ? Against this has been quoted the statement of Hermias, In Phaedrum 245C, p. I02, ed. Couvreur, that he interpreted ' all soul is immortal ' as referring to the world-soul. This is important, but is the exegesis of a single text.61 On the other side, the only passage which can with high probability be regarded as evidence is Sextus, AdvPhys I, 7I ff. The language of this is obscure and perhaps corrupt, but it certainly speaks of the idea that ' souls persist as they are by themselves and are not, as Epicurus said, dispersed like smoke when released from their bodies, for before that it was not the body which controlled them but they themselves were responsible for the continued (possibly " conjoined ") existence of the body and much more for their own'. Now the second part of this statement agrees closely with Achilles, Isag. in Aratum, I3, ' Posidonius said that the Epicureans were ignorant of the fact that it is not bodies which hold souls together but souls which hold bodies together, as glue holds together both itself and external things.' 62 It is therefore probable that the whole quotation in Sextus is from Posidonius, including also what follows, that the soul ascends after death to some part of the sky and perhaps also that the soul emanates from the sun (this should perhaps be predicated of the rational element in it).63 It is moreover a fair inference from various texts that Posidonius regarded the sun as the heart,64 we might say the powerhouse, of the universe. It has been remarked that Posidonius was the first known Stoic to write Concerning heroes and daimones (Macrob., Sat. I, Z3, 7). ' Heroas et lares et genios ' in Varro ap. Aug., CivD vii, 6, and 'quid lares et genii, quid in secundam numinum formam animae perpetitae ' in Sen., Ep. 90, 28, seem to be pertinent. Diog. Laert. VII, I5I, reports a Stoic belief in daimones who watch over human affairs (as in Hesiod) and in heroes, i.e. the souls 53 Stoa u. Stoiker 367. (In Nachr. Gottingen II, 9, I938, 205, Pohlenz had accepted the formulation as Chrysippean.) 54 cf. also what Galen quotes just before the passage adduced above: ' For I think that the con- sideration of goods and evils and that of ends and that of virtue depend on the right understanding of emotion.' 55 One can never be sure how far Seneca is following a source (his explicit references to authori- ties sometimes seem to be inserted as a device of style): yet in ? I3 the body is not the prison but the sheath of the soul. 56 cf. Cleomed. ii, I, 87, p. I58, Ziegler (Rudberg's view that this is drawn from Posidonius seems to me in substance probable. He did not mince words: cf. the picture of Athenion in F 36). 57 cf. R. Walzer, CQ XLIII, I949, 82 ff. (inference from Galen). 58 Plac. 445M. (466 K); Scr. min. II, 78 (iv, 820K); Pohlenz, Fleck.

I, 64 (cited, p. 9 above), presumably daimones -not heavenly bodies, though they too were thought to be animate (e.g. ND II, 42). Non liquet, you may say: but perhaps further reflection on bai'ov will help.66 The 5al'icov in the individual is so to speak a supersoul; in a way it both is and is not his highest intelligence. It is the most sovereign part of the soul, a divine gift, lodged in the top of our body, raising us up to our kindred in the heaven (Tim. goA). It raises us, we follow it or cherish it or worship it, as also we can enslave our ' most divine part ' to its opposite (Rep. 589E). In a way, the power and responsibility of decision lies outside both the 6a'cov and the lower animal principle and chooses between the two. Daimon is in the highest sense a Protean word, 4 protecting spirit' ' destiny,' ' luck,' etc.; yet in Plato and Posidonius alike it seems to have something more than the abstractness of 9jOoS &amp;vOpcbrrc0 8aiipcov, 'your character is your luck.' A 5acThcov could naturally be thought of as surviving the death of the individual without the necessity to suppose the continuance of personality as such. (When Cicero says (ND ii, 62), ' quorum cum remanerent animi atque aeternitate fruerentur, rite di sunt habiti, cum et optimi essent et aeterni,' he is speaking of Hercules, etc., not of humanity in general.) Of one thing we can be tolerably certain-that Posidonius was wholly removed from the commentatio mortis of the Phaedo as reflected in Cic., TD I, 74. To use A. 0. Lovejoy's phrase (The Great Chain of Being 45), the Timaeus shows 'a peculiarly exuberant kind of this-worldliness '; there is a balance, not an antithesis, of soul and body (89 f.), and the treatise On the Sublime (32, 5f.) shows what emotion could be aroused by its picture of ' the human tabernacle'. Plotinus himself, after quoting from Cratylus, Phaedo, and Republic (IV, 8, I, ? 7,11. 40 ff.) observed, ' In all these passages he has deplored the coming of the soul to the body; yet in the Timaeus he praises the kosmos, meaning this earthly world, and says that it is a blessed god and that the Creator in his goodness gave it soul in order that this totality might be gifted with reason..... The soul of the totality was sent into it, as was the soul of each of us, by God, to the end that the totality might be perfect.' In the Timaeus the highest possibilities for man lie here and now in this wonderful universe which he must observe and must treat as an exemplar; in that way he can correct his congenital distortion (p. goD). The comment just quoted from Plotinus is notably close to the statement by Posidonius of man's Highest Good, as preserved for us by Clement of Alexandria (Strom. II, 2I, I29, p. I83 St.), ' to live contemplating the truth and order of all things and doing one's part in helping to establish that order, without being in any way led by the unreasoning part of the soul.' 67 We must set beside this Cic., ND II, 37, 'ipse autem homo ortus est ad mundum contemplandum et imitandum-nullo modo perfectus, sed est quaedam particula perfecti.' The phrase comes between two quotations from Chrysippus, and his imagination might have been fired by Tim. 47C and produced an anticipation of Posidonius. Yet at least the latter added in characteristic fashion a frank recognition of the unruly element in man, and ' doing one's part in helping to establish that order ', if that is the right reading, gives something like the grandeur of another definition of ' the chief end of man '-that in the Shorter Catechism, ' To glorify God, and to enjoy Him for ever.' 8.

Pohlenz ii, i2i, agrees with Wilamowitz, Glaube II, 407, n. 2, in thinking 'without being . . . soul ' to be an addition of Clement, but himself regards it as an explanation by Posidonius of his statement as to man's Highest Good. Pohlenz, in defending aOTfrv, has been followed by subsequent writers. Sylburg's emendation, aoT6v, would agree with ' Chrysippus', but a'rriv makes a possible and striking sense. For a remote analogy cf. a phrase put by a Rabbi in God's mouth, 'Whenever I seek to do you good, you enfeeble the supernal power,' meaning ' Sin thwarts God's purpose of grace ' (G. F Moore, Yudaism I, 472).</page><page sequence="13">POSIDONIUS I3 suggest itself. His fourth book closes with a passage of sustained elevation on man's unique achievement in penetrating the secrets of the sky. For the Greek, as for the Jew, the special place of man in the world was a familiar thought, as Soph., Ant. 33Z if. and Ps. 8 remind us. But when we read (iv, 905 if.) ' stetit unus in arcem erectus capitis, victorque ad sidera mittit sidereos oculos ', we have in sidereos oculos something which instantly suggests the remark of Posidonius on the principle of ' like by like' (p. IO above). So in I, 250, 'vis animae divina regit' is ordinary Stoicism, but 254, ' summaque per varias maneat cognata figuras ' does suggest' vitalism'; again, the survey (IV, 7II -743) of physical characteristics proper to the inhabitants of particular regions strongly suggests Posidonius. The best known lines of Manilius are ii, II5 . quis caelum posset nisi caeli munere nosse, et reperire deum, nisi qui pars ipse deorum est ? We may compare Achilles, Isag. in Arat. I (P. 30, I5 Maass) and Plin., NH II, 95, 'Hipparchus numquam satis laudatus, ut quo niemo magis adprobaverit cognationem cum homine siderum animasque nostras partem esse caeli ' (which means, I think, that the investigations of Hipparchus are the proof of man's kinship with the stars, not that H. expressed ideas of mysticisme astral). Now G. Vallauri has noted the similarity of these and other expressions in Manilius to the Hermetica.68 A striking example is the closeness of Manilius Iv, 866 if. to Corp. Herm. xi, zi (the answer to those who say that such questions are too high for man, as Philo indeed maintained, MigrAbr. I84, and Somn. I, 54).6 Our philosophical Hermetica are, almost certainly, without- exception later than Manilius; but it is reasonable to assume that astrological treatises under the name of Hermes Trismegistus circulated earlier, and possible to suppose that they may have included, in prefatory remarks, sentiments and ideas such as are found in the philosophical Hermetica. Even so, what was the inspiration-and I say inspiration rather than source ? Let me quote also Manilius II, 122 ff.: ni sanctos animis oculos natura dedisset cognatamque sibi mentem vertisset ad ipsam et tantum dictasset opus, caeloque veniret quod vocat in caelum sacra ad commercia rerum. In the heyday of enthusiasm for Posidonius M. Pohlenz (B. phil. Woch. I902, Io6 ff.) was far from ready to postulate any direct acquaintance of Manilius with the writings of Posidonius; and of course M. may be credited with some originality. Thus it would seem that no parallel has been adduced for II, 107 . 'quem denique in unum descendit deus atque habitat seque ipse requirit'; it may well be an individual color. Pohlenz, in the review just quoted, spoke of Posidonius as determining ' die wissen- schaftliche communis opinio der Folgezeit '-and he certainly exercised a powerful influence in this direction. My present concern is to urge that Posidonius was the cause of a new enthusiasm about physical phenomena in general which came to be in the air and to affect people who need not be thought to have opened even an epitome of one of his treatises.70 It is a case of what is sometimes called ' the seepage of ideas Roman interest in the stars was fostered by Aratus, as the translations by Cicero and Germanicus attest: but what could be further from the mood of Manilius than that of 68 Riv Fil LXXXII, I954, I33 ff. Cf. Reinhardt, P-W 819 and my remarks, Gnomon xv, I939, 363 ff. (the reference to a horoscope in the Saite text there quoted was a mistranslation, a fact which I owe to the kindness of Prof. 0. Neugebauer). 69 Elsewhere he shows sympathy with' mysticisme astral' (Cumont, Bull. acad. Belg. I909, 28I f.; Festugiere, Re'vel II, 555 if.). 70 cf. G. Zuntz, Proc. Brit. Acad. XLII, I956, 224 (apropos of the famous fragment of the Hypo- bolimaios) 'That kind of speech does not come from transcribing a philosopher's tenets: it comes from the heart. But the heart may well be awakened to these wonders by a philosopher's writings. It would be preposterous to assume that Menander had not read the exoteric works of Aristotle'. Menander was a friend of Demetrius of Phaleron, and by tradition of Theophrastus also. But the ideas reached his audience also and were comprehensible ; we have always the evidence of Aristophanes for the circulation of new thinking at Athens. We can postulate something of the sort for the intelligentsia at Rome. One fact might indeed be adduced against the view that Posidonius exercised the pervasive influence here claimed for him: it is the apparent absence of any clear allusion in Philodemus who continued to live for some time after his death and who had a close contact with Roman society. For one possible explicit allusion cf. W. Cronert, Kolotes u. Menedemos I77; the suggestion of Oldfather in the Loeb edition of Aeneas Tacticus, etc., p. 230, n. I, that there is an allusion to his Tactica in Concerning the good king by Homeric standards p. 33 is unconvincing. In doxography he is the latest Stoic cited-and often.</page><page sequence="14">I4 ARTHUR DARBY NOCK Aratus ? For Aratus the heavenly bodies are signs of the seasons, created by Zeus in his forethought for men; the appropriate myths appear, but the tone is matter of fact, like that of the Watchman's speech in the Agamemnon. Set in contrast with this Virgil, G. II, 475 ff., with its unmistakeable depth of feeling. As Norden observed,71 the prayer to the Muses echoes Lucr. I, 9Z4 f. and rerum cognoscere causas (490) suggests De rerum natura: the trampling on the fear of death matches ' docti furor arduus Lucreti ' in its passionate glorification of deliverance by knowledge. Moreover, while Epicureans were in theory content with any explanation of phenomena which would obviate the necessity of supposing capricious divine intervention, Lucretius shows a sense of joyous initiation into the secrets of the universe when he writes (III, I6 f.) diffugiunt animi terrores, moenia mundi discedunt, totum video per inane geri res. Yet Virgil is not writing as an out and out Epicurean: 'fortunatus et ille deos qui novit agrestes ' (493) is infinitely remote from the patronizing tolerance with which an Epicurean fragment edited by Diels, SBBerlin I9I6, 902, speaks of extravagant piety. Furthermore, Virgil repeated some of his words in Aen. I, 742 if. Jopas is entertaining Dido's guests, and he uses themes of natural science, without any suggestion that they are treated in order to banish fears; no, they are there for their own sake and they found favour with an audience drawn in the image of Augustan society. Virgil himself had a deep personal concern with philosophy and is said to have purposed to devote the remainder of his life to it after finishing the Aeneid; and yet his words would have found some echo in contemporaries with far less spirituality (cf. Propert. III, 5, 23 if.). As M. Schanz observed (Gesch. rim. Lit. II, i, 57I), ' eine Reihe von Fragen physikalischen Inhalts war fast Modesache geworden.' The poets apart, our best evidence is found in Vitruvius and in the elaborate general essays which he included in the various books of his De architectura. He mentions Posidonius but once (viii, 3, 27), with a number of other names, and the whole list may well come from an intermediary source. It is, indeed, highly probable that he had Posidonian material, but I do not press that: the important thing for this discussion is precisely that he thought it worth his while to make these disquisitions (e.g. vi, i, on climatology, which gives much that was of no use to a practical architect) ; Vitruvius was clearly consulting the tastes of a cultivated reading public which liked such things. The circumstances of the time may have favoured the rise of such a concern: it is tempting to recall the groups in London and Oxford which during the Civil War and the Commonwealth met together and constituted the nucleus of the Royal Society. Yet I incline to think that Posidonius and his followers, e.g. Athenodorus, who was, after all, the teacher and intimate of Augustus, did much to create a climate of opinion. As with Darwin earlier, so with Freud later, the repercussions went far beyond the circle of readers, let alone of serious students. Later on, Seneca's explicit references show that Posidonius was to him an important source of information; but is it not a good deal more significant that he chose to write about natural phenomena and produced NQ as an independent work (not as part of the concerns of an encyclopaedist, for which he would have had neither the capacity nor the inclination) ? Cicero set himself to produce a philosophic corpus and he did essay the translation of the Timaeus, but there is no indication that he felt a separate treatment of natural phenomena to be a part of his proper business; he had the highest esteem for Posidonius, and owed much to him, but not the particular mental concern which we are considering. That may be seen at a humble level in the Aetna, possibly written by a contemporary of Seneca's; here is the enthusiasm for the study of nature, with a personal color, a choice of terrestrial rather than celestial phenomena (252 f.).72 71 Die rom. Literatur (ed. H. Fuchs), 6o. 72 De Lacy, TAPA LXXIV, I943, I69 f., argues forcibly that the author was an Epicurean. Yet he is not outspokenly Epicurean; the miraculous deliverance of the pious brothers (604 ff.) does not fit the beliefs of the Garden. 'ipse procul tantos miratur luppiter ignes' (zo3) could be dismissed as poetic phraseology, but 367 ff., against the vulgar idea that the volcano is tired and resting to gather strength, seems to me definitely strange on the hypothesis. ' exhaustos cessare sinus ' is like what Lucr. ii, II 50 f. maintains ; cf. indeed Sen., Ep. go, 44, but certainly 'non est divinis tam sordida rebus egestas ' (37I) would fit a Stoic better.</page><page sequence="15">POSIDONIUS I5 Posidonius did not communicate to others his interest in making observations 73; when the Elder Pliny set out to study the eruption of Vesuvius he did something unique. But Posidonius did perhaps communicate to others a sense for the wonders of nature. As Pohlenz has remarked,74 the pseudo-Aristotelian work On the universe is un-Peripatetic in warmth of religious feeling: and let us note (39Ia, 4 ff.) the idea that whereas others shrank from rising to contemplate all things, philosophy did not fear this: do we not see here the mood which we found in Manilius ? Be it added that, in contrast with Apocalyptic and Corp. Herm. i, 3, this is a desire for knowledge of the secrets of the universe on the basis of human penetration and not of supernatural revelation. Edwyn Bevan said that Posidonius sought to make men at home in the Universe. The phrase is warranted, so long as it is not taken to mean that man was not naturally at home. With his kinship to the stars all he need do is what anatomy had long been observed to direct-look up. The purpose of Posidonius was better defined by Schwartz, 'to bring man and humanity back to their natural community with the Divine.' 5 There was an old New England clergyman who in the first decade of the century used to preach once a year a sermon on recent discoveries in astronomy. He followed them for himself and the sermon was always long, forty-five or fifty minutes. A friend once ventured to ask him whether this sermon meant anything to the congregation. ' Nothing at all, my dear boy,' was the answer: 'but it greatly enlarges my idea of God.' ' Perducit illo unde lucet,' says Seneca (NQ i, pr. z). Posidonius did not remake the Stoa, but he greatly enlarged men's concept of the divine in the universe and in their breasts and it may be that, like the author of the Fourth Gospel, he was the cause of mysticism in others without being himself a mystic. 73 cf. W. Kroll, Stud. z. Verstdndnis d. rrni. Literatur 28o ff. 74 Die Stoa I, 36I. 75 Charakterk6pfe i, 99.</page></plain_text>
