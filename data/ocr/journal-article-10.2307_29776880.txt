<plain_text><page sequence="1">250 Italian Americana Giovanni Verga and the Roots of Ita Han America GEORGE GUIDA City University of New York Even though he was not himself a peasant, Giovanni Verga sought to interpret the world of the peasants in their own terms. Born in 1840, in Catania, Sicily, to an aristocratic family, Verga at age twenty-five published his first novel and moved to Florence, and then, eight years later, to Milan. During the 1870s, he published autobiographical novels of upper-class romantic intrigue, all of which reflect the influence of French realism, but none of which stands as a literary achievement of any great merit. Only in the mid 1870s did Verga turn his attention to the subject of his later masterpieces, the way of life of southern Italian, particularly Sicilian, peasants. That way of life inspired two great novels, I Malavoglia (1881) and Maestro Don Gesualdo (1889); and two superb collections of short stories, Vita dei Campi (1880) and Novelle Rusticane (1883) (the collections originally translated into English by D. H. Lawrence). Verga's Sicilians live the lives of most late nineteenth century contadini, the peasants of the Mezzogiorno. Their condition, often their survival, depended upon the year's harvest. Poverty, custom and a rigid moral code set the tone of their lives. These strictures fueled passions and unexpected violence that disrupted a seemingly idyllic existence (Cecchetti, "Introduction" xii). Simply to maintain their humble place in society, peasants had constantly to check their desires, since one affront to the honor of a woman or family, one protest to his landlord, could spell a peasant's end. This condition is the lens through which Verga's Sicilian tales project the peasants' lives. The types of people who inhabit Verga's tales ? day laborers, small landowners, shepherds, and other economically marginal figures ? accounted for up to two thirds of the population of many Sicilian towns (Gabaccia 6). As Verga presents them, these peasants are proud people accustomed to misery, seeking whatever joy they can find in their difficult lives. The author captures the details and values of their traditional world, in a dignified rendition of their own language and thought patterns. The sum of his themes and techniques came to be known as verismo. Verismo, which means literally "realism," does not correspond to the nineteenth century literary realism of English and American authors. Italian veristi, among whom Verga was preeminent, explored the conflicts between man's (often humble, futile) life and his ambitions. In this way, their work stands midway between what American critics would call realism and naturalism. Verga's tales portray both the economic predicament of Southern peasants and their resulting sense of impotence to change their situation: a situation that fosters a typically Sicilian, tragic view of life (Toschi 14). Since the peasant life that Verga depicts has largely vanished in the Mezzogiorno, his literary recreation is as near an experience of actual nineteenth-century peasant existence, and of the future emigrants' consciousness, as we have. In general, Verga's stories convey a strong sense of campanilismo ? the peasants' limitation and attachment to their town and its environs ? and their suspicion of outsiders. They convey also, at every turn, the effects of poverty. Verga's third</page><page sequence="2">Giovanni Verga and the Roots of Italian America 151 person narrators speak as villagers, as if they are reminding readers, not necessarily informing them, of the village personae and local places they describe. Yet, they speak with knowledge beyond the limits of the villagers' consciousness. This balance between identification and distance from subject lends Verga's voice a journalistic objectivity that renders the tragedy of his tales even more shocking and powerful. Witness the opening lines of a tale upon which Leoncavallo based his classic opera, "Cavalleria Rusticana" (1880): "When Turiddu Macca, Nunzia's son, came back from the service, he used to strut in the square on Sundays in his bersagliere uniform with the red cap that looked like the one worn by the fortuneteller who sets up a bench with a cage of canaries" (10). For the townspeople, with whom the narrator shares certain knowledge (of a particular kind of fortuneteller, for instance), Turiddu, an impoverished former soldier, is both an object of admiration and resentment. The mixed feelings that he inspires within the community ultimately seal his doom. Like Turiddu, the protagonists of Verga's other Sicilian tales contend with the various hardships that forced so many peasants to emigrate. All three characters in "Black Bread" (1882), Santo, Lucia (Santo's sister), and Nena (Santo's wife), work like dogs in order to eat. Lucia resents their lot, even as she accepts it; and at various points, she expresses the sort of class resentment common among the contadini (Mangione and Morreale 48-53). From her point of view, we understand the interplay of economic and social life. "That crook of a field watchman had done himself a favor by marrying off his daughter [Nena] without a dowry, and now it was up to Santo to support her. Since Nena had been with him, Santo saw that he didn't have enough bread for both of them and they would have to snatch it by the sweat of their brow from the land..." (Verga 172). For her part, Lucia realizes too late that the only way to have saved her dying mother would have been to accede to the unwanted romantic advances and dowry of an older galantuomo (or gentleman), a member of the landowning upper class. In this world, the wish for marriage, like the wish for salvation, comes at a heavy price. As common in the Mezzogiorno as class conflict and suppression of desire was illness: illness arising from the peasants' very livelihood, the land. Following the Risorgimento, a new crop of landlords set about clearing large tracts of Southern forests, in order to maximize their profits from agriculture. Deforestation led to soil erosion, which turned areas of formerly hospitable valleys into marshes, breeding grounds for malaria-carrying insects (Nelli 20). Peasants often walked miles each day through these marshes, from their hill towns to the fields they worked. Many contracted malaria. Verga allows us to feel the ravages of the disease as the peasants felt them, in his 1881 tale "Malaria." The narrator of the tale expresses the connection between peasant labor in the post-Risorgimento South and illness, in a single metaphor. "Malaria," he remarks, "gets into your bones with the bread you eat" (Verga 118). He goes on to describe the effects of the disease from the peasant perspective. Malaria "snatches up the villagers in the deserted streets and nails them in front of the door of their houses plasterless from the sun, and they shake with fever under their overcoats and under all the bed blankets piled upon their shoulders" (118). Verga changes the tone of his narrative voice here from folkloric ("snatches up the villagers") and Christian ("nails them in front of the door") to documentary ("they shake with fever"). For him, malaria is a mythical, as well as a literal, plague. It precipitates the peasants' flight from a homeland that is also, metaphorically, ancient</page><page sequence="3">152 Italian Americana Egypt; as it is a cause of emigration rooted in socio-historical conditions. Day in and day out, the peasants endure malaria at work and play, escaping it only when they leave, because as "Wife-killer" (a character whose several wives all die of the disease) reasons, "for those people there just isn't malaria!" (127). Unless and until, like many real contadini of the period, Verga's peasants overcome their fatalism and emigrate, they simply assume the risks and accept the frequently fatal consequences as a fact of life. "Freedom" (1882), prefiguring II Gattopardo, recounts yet another peasant hardship, disappointment with the Risorgimento. The story begins, "They hung the tricolor kerchief [the flag of united Italy] from the campanile, sounded the alarm with the bells, and began to shout in the square: 'Hail to freedom!'" (206). It ends, "The charcoal man, while they were handcuffing him again, stammered: 'Where are you taking me? To jail? Why? I didn't even get a foot of land. And they had said there was freedom!..."' (216). The freedom Garibaldi's liberators promised evolves into a new form of imprisonment of the peasants, at the hands of the civil authorities that the Garibaldini helped to establish. From the 1860s through the 1880s, disastrous agricultural practices, along with an onerous system of taxation, plunged the peasants even deeper into La Miseria. Corrupt landowners and ruthless overseers went unchecked by a distant government whose policies reflected its own susceptibility to corruption. As land grew less productive through mismanagement, taxes rose until they were the highest in Europe (Nelli 23), and inequitable to boot. Cows, usually owned by wealthy landlords, were not taxable commodities; mules, usually owned by contadini (and used by Verga as symbols of peasant suffering and survival) were (Mangione and Morreale 63). The peasants, though no longer serfs, were now slaves to capital. It may be difficult for us to imagine how the peasants of the Mezzogiorno survived the wrath of all the forces ? social, natural, political, economic ? arrayed against them. Verga's characters show us how. In "Property" (1882), they survive through ceaseless work and furberia (cleverness, cunning) (Gambino, Blood 134). The protagonist of "Property," Mazzar?, embodies furberia. His name itself echoes both the Sicilian massaro, one given to "diligent application" of himself (Gabaccia 6), and the Italian amazzare, "to kill," suggesting all at once Mazzar?'s all-consuming diligence, his social and spiritual suicide, and his symbolic killing off of masters. "He had gotten together all that property himself, with his hands and with his mind, by not sleeping at night, by catching fever from anxiety or from malaria, by toiling from morning till night, and going around in the sun and in the rain, by wearing out his boots and his mules..." (Verga 143-44). Mazzar? has not achieved the ends of property according to peasant values ? the preservation of family and folkways ? but he has mastered the means. Although he has "no children, nor grandchildren, nor other relatives" (144) and no peace of mind, Mazzar? understands full well that "[pjroperty doesn't belong to those who have it, but to those who know how to get it'" (144). He understands too what the proprietor must do to maintain property. "After he had gotten his property, he certainly didn't send word that he was coming to supervise the harvest or the vintage, and when and how, but turned up unexpectedly, on foot or on a mule, without watchmen, with a piece of bread in his pocket; and he slept near his sheaves, his eyes open, and his shotgun between his legs" (144-45). This final image of Mazzar? crystallizes Verga's depiction of his furberia, and his</page><page sequence="4">Giovanni Verga and the Roots of Italian America 153 accumulation of property. Mazzar? overcomes economic oppression through a relentless effort that deprives him of family and spiritual comfort. "So, when they told him that the time had come to leave his property and think of his soul, he staggered out into the courtyard like a madman" (147). The peasant is, and in reality frequently was, forced to choose between his livelihood on one hand, and his family and traditional values on the other. In other tales, Verga portrays, with both sympathy and scorn, the values and folkways that sustain peasants and, later, emigrants from the Mezzogiorno. In "Cavalleria Rusticana," a young man, Turiddu, dies in the name of honor, at the hands of his true love's husband, Alfio. Forbidden to marry the beautiful Santa for lack of money, Turiddu becomes her lover. Alfio finds out and must defend his honor. The Southern Italian code of honor compelled the offended to respond quickly and decisively to whatever person has sullied his or his family's character. Adherents to this code, the contadini, held marriage as the fullest expression of family integrity and any challenge to an established marriage as the ultimate offense (Alba 33). A husband's honor, and his family's honor, depended upon his wife's (and his other female relatives') loyalty and to shame (Rando 24). Anything less than restoration of honor would endanger the peasant's own economic and social status and that of his family, since family honor, its interplay with social status and property, formed the basis of useful social ties (Gabaccia IV, 9, 220). Turiddu recognizes Alfio's masculine obligation to defend his family's honor and agrees to a dual in which Alfio kills him. Alfio is triumphant. "'That's for making a cuckold of me in my own house'" (18), he declares. Turiddu is, on the other hand, tragic, his death grotesque. "For a while Turiddu staggered here and there among the cactuses and then fell like a log. Blood gurgled up and foamed in his throat, and he couldn't even gasp: Ah, mamma mia!" (18). He begins the tale as a popinjay marching in uniform through the town square, an object of admiration as well as resentment; and ends up like dog in the dust, an object of scorn, dead young, in service of the Mezzogiorno code of honor. As much as they lived by this code of honor, the Southern Italian peasants lived by a complex system of superstitions and religious beliefs. In "Rosso Malpelo" and "War Between Saints" (1880) Verga renders important aspects of Southern pagan superstition and saint-worship. Many Sicilians, peasant and otherwise, believed that redheads had evil dispositions (Cecchetti, Giovanni 65), a belief which determines the fate of the story's protagonist, Malpelo (literally, "evil hair"). Superstitions like this one were common among the peasants, products of age-old uncertainty and vulnerability. Over the centuries, the contadini s Biblical vicissitudes led them to speculate that warring saints and demons dictated their destinies (Gambino, Blood 213-14), that free will, if it existed at all, was a relatively weak force. In this spirit, they testified to the endurance of Magna Graecia. From the outset of his story, superstition binds Malpelo. "He was called Malpelo because he had red hair; and he had red hair because he was a mean and bad boy, who promised to turn into a first-rate scoundrel. So everybody at the red-sand quarry called him Malpelo, and even his mother, having always heard that name, had almost forgotten his real one" (Verga 65). Verga makes clear that, like superstition itself, Malpelo's hair and name are self-fulfilling prophecies. Onto the young boy, Verga projects peasant fatalism.</page><page sequence="5">254 Italian Americana Verga's narrator speaks with the voice of superstitious peasants, in his condemnation of the unfortunate lad. "[H]e would go and huddle in a corner/' the narrator reveals, "his basket between his legs, to nibble his piece of dark bread, as animals like him do" (emphasis added) (Verga 66). Here, Verga compares Malpelo to a beast, valued for what he can do and not for who he is. No one cares for Malpelo, because of his red hair (Selig 35), a trait upon which the peasant consciousness of the narrative seizes as a means of explaining the boy's otherwise inexplicable malignancy; and because no one cares for him, he is sent to work on a dangerous project in the same quarry that killed his father. No "man with a family wanted to take a chance, nor would he let his own flesh and blood run such a risk for all the gold in the world. But as for Malpelo, he didn't even have anyone who would want to take all the gold in the world for his hide, if it was really worth that much: so they thought of him" (85). Malpelo does not protest this or any other mistreatment. "'What for?'" he asks, resigned, "I'm Malpelo'" (73). In the absolute, article-less manner of the Italian language, "Malpelo" is adjective as noun, defining identity as well as quality. (To say, for example, "I am a Southerner," one would say, "Sono meridionale," not "Sono un meridionale.") If the peasants believed that supernatural forces controlled their destinies, then for them no force was greater than their patron saints. In the Mezzogiorno, the peasant called upon his patron saint to bless the land, and he believed the saint's benediction would have a material, often immediate, effect (De Rosa 5). His interaction with his saint, as with God and the Holy Family, was personal, familiar (Gambino, Blood 221). Verga plumbs the depth of this belief in "War Between Saints." The narrator of the story recounts the battle for processional rights through a small town, between the devotees of Saint Rocco and those of Saint Paschal. Depending upon where they reside, the peasants pray to one or the other, for rain and immunity to cholera. To supplicate according to custom?a custom that survives to this day in Italy and Little Italies throughout the world (Orsi, "Religious" 330) ? they march icons of the saints through town in ritual procession. In fact, they did carry Saint Paschal in procession, to the east and to the west, and they held him high on the hill to bless the fields, one sultry, cloudy day in May ? one of those days when the farmers tear their hair in front of their burnt fields, and the wheatears bend down just as if they were dying (Verga 103). Nino, one of these afflicted farmers, who lives in the rival district of Saint Rocco, blames his rivals' saint for his problems. '"Damned Saint Paschal!' he shouts, "spitting in the air running through the wheat field like a madman. 'You've ruined me, Saint Paschal, you thief! All you've left me is a sickle to cut my throat with!'" (103) Later, Nino heaps abuse on his own patron, who, as he sees it, has done equally little to improve his condition. '"Ah, Saint Rocco, you thief!' Nino began to lament. T didn't expect this from you!.. .'Ah, Saint Rocco!' said he. "This is a dirtier trick than Saint Paschal played on us!'" (106). His reliance, anger, imprecation of his own saint reflect the nature of the Southern contadino saint worship, which could often end in outright iconoclasm and deposition of the patron in favor of another (Salamone-Marino 172-74).</page><page sequence="6">Giovanni Verga and the Roots of Italian America 155 Verga presents this peasant approach to worship as both charming and senseless. In his stories, Saints mean much to peasants, but do not materially change their lives. At the close of "War Between Saints," the two main characters, Nino and Saridda, recovering together from cholera, continue to argue the relative power their patron saints, neither of whom has done anything to alleviate either drought or illness. "And you? Do you think it was Saint Rocco who kept you alive?" "Why don't you stop it!" broke in Saridda. "Or weTl need another cholera to make peace!" (Verga 107) In Saridda's irony we hear Verga's. It is irony, however, which, while it satirizes the peasants' reliance on saints to deliver them, stops short of discounting saint worship entirely. The feste surrounding it was, after all, one of the joys of peasant life. Certainly, peasant life could, in many ways, be joyous and beautiful, but its hardships appear to us now less than nostalgia-inspiring. Yet, a longing for peasant life in the Mezzogiorno marks a great deal of Italian American narrative. That longing is often nostalgia for bellTtalia, the beautiful land itself. I have heard Italians remark, "C'e il mare, c'e il sole. Che cos'altro ci vuole?" ("We have the sea and the sun. What else do we need?"). Verga's "Ieli" (1880) illustrates this sentiment, a deep feeling for the land, not only as soil, but also as landscape, idealized site of innocence and simplicity. Ieli, a poor shepherd boy, and Don Alfonso, the young son of a wealthy landowner, share days together in the pastures. Ah, the wonderful chases over the mown fields, manes in the wind! the beautiful days of April, when the wind piled up the green grass into waves and the mares neighed in the pastures! the beautiful summer afternoons, when the whitish countryside lay silent under the hazy sky, and the grasshoppers crackled among the clods, as if the stubble were catching fire! the beautiful winter sky through the naked branches of the almond tree that shivered in the north wind, and the path that sounded frozen under the horses' hoofs, and the skylarks that sang high up in the warmth, in the blue! the beautiful summer evenings that came up very slowly, like fog, the good smell of the hay in which you sank your elbows, and the melancholy humming of the evening insects, and those two notes of Ieli's pipe, always the same ?ee-oo! ee-oo! ee-oo! (20) The narrative reminiscence foreshadows the loss of innocence and simplicity of which Ieli's life becomes a symbol; an innocence and simplicity that Don Alfonso and, later, immigrants from Italy, convinced themselves they had had and lost; an imaginary, timeless life (Boelhower, Immigrant 103-08), which was in reality the existence of a people held in poverty and ignorance by immemorial custom (Mangione and Morreale 51); a life at least as miserable as it was innocent and simple. Portions of "Ieli," like portions of many Italian American narratives, are pastoral reconstructions of Mezzogiorno life. Classical pastoral locates simplicity and innocence in the shepherd, presenting his life as (Christ-like) ideal. In the pastoral tale, the shepherd suffers and savors simple pleasures for the entire community</page><page sequence="7">156 Italian Americana (Marinelli 6). (The Italian title of the story has been translated as "Ieli the Shepherd/') Verga's pastoral, like those of Theocritus and the Italian American immigrant autobiographers, begins with an experienced adult looking back on an innocent childhood (10). As he grows older, Don Alfonso learns to read?which causes Ieli to look "at the book and at him suspiciously" (Verga 26). Don Alfonso then assumes his position in the rigid caste system (Covello 75) of the Mezzogiorno, the position of galantuomo. The galantuomini (gentlemen) were well-to-do men, landowners associated, usually by blood, with baronial estates. They recognized each other's cultural and class superiority, and forced the lower social classes to do the same (97). After he has taken his rightful position and left Ieli behind in the fields, Don Alfonso has an affair with Mara, the woman who, in part because Don Alfonso ruins her reputation, agrees to marry Ieli. Class distinction and Mara's attraction to Alfonso ultimately corrupt and destroy Ieli. Though slow, Ieli slowly comes to recognize his wife's adultery with Alfonso and to feel a shame and anger about it that he cannot fully comprehend. During an argument, a shepherd boy tells Ieli what everyone else in the town already knows, that Don Alfonso "has taken your wife" (Verga 60). Labeled a "cuckold," the strongest of all insults in Southern Italy (Alba 34), even the gentle, unsuspecting Ieli must react. "Even when he thought of Don Alfonso, he couldn't believe that such a dirty trick was possible; he still could see him at Tebedi [the pasture lands], with his kind eyes and his smiling little mouth coming to bring sweets and white bread, so long ago ?such a dirty trick! And since he hadn't seen him any more, for he was a poor shepherd who stayed in the country the whole year round, he always remembered him that way" (Verga 62). His wife's and Alfonso's corruption raise Ieli's consciousness of his limitation as peasant and his disgrace as cuckold, poisoning his contentment. At a "picnic in the country at shearing time" (63), in the company of both Mara and Don Alfonso, Ieli is at first able to overcome incipient feelings of shame and anger, and enjoy the pastoral scene. From his point of view, so close to the natural world, we hear, "It was a beautiful, warm day in the golden fields with the flowering hedges and the long green rows of vines. The sheep were gamboling and bleating with pleasure at feeling themselves freed from all that wool, and in the kitchen the women were making a big fire to cook all the things that the owner had brought for dinner" (63). Still, amid the simple gaiety of the country outing?one of the peasants' few escapes from ceaseless labor and suffering (qtd. in Salamone-Marino 123), Ieli is reminded of his class inferiority and his disgrace. "Meanwhile, the rich men who were waiting had gone into the shade under the carob trees, and were having someone play the tambourines and bagpipes, and those who wanted to, danced with the women of the farm" (Verga 63). In this pastoral setting, Don Alfonso's and Mara's corruption infects Ieli, and he finally succumbs. "Ieli, while he was shearing the sheep, felt something gnaw inside him, without knowing why, like a thorn, a driven nail, a pair of fine shears that worked around inside him bit by bit, worse than poison" (63). When, over Ieli's objections, Mara goes off to dance with Alfonso, Ieli slits Alfonso's throat with his shears, transforming from innocent to murderer and symbol of growing peasant discontent with the ongoing inequities of post-Risorgimento Italy. To understand fully Verga's use of symbolism and other narrative elements, we need to recognize the prevalence, in nineteenth-century Mezzogiorno life, of</page><page sequence="8">Giovanni Verga and the Roots of Italian America 157 the folktale, the timeless peasant narrative form and means of transmitting cultural and moral customs and lessons (Covello 266-68). Writing in 1960, Mario Pei recognized the lingering power of myth and legend in Southern Italian society. "Even today," wrote Pei, "the miraculous exploits of mythological and legendary heroes continue to be recounted by cantastorie, those often illiterate bards who wander from village to village" (Preface ix). In order to understand the Southern Italian peasant consciousness of cyclical time and attachment to elemental, pre industrial life, as well as the influence of creeping capitalism upon that consciousness (Propp 17), we must recognize this living tradition. Verga often layers the realistic detail of his short stories over folkoric narrative structures. He employs this strategy most strikingly in "Story of the Saint Joseph Donkey" (1881). The story is an elaboration of a traditional Italian folktale form, the animal fable or animal tale, a brief narrative of a particular animal's adventures (Calvino xx; Degh 68). The Saint Joseph Donkey of the title is the tale's principal character, his life and death a metaphor for peasant hardship. Verga's choice of a donkey as protagonist suits the theme of peasant hardship especially well, since the peasants he depicts typically work like donkeys, the humblest, most docile, and most encumbered of the Mezzogiorno's domesticated beasts (Pacifici 11). The donkey, a creature common in Italian folklore from the time and influence of storytellers like Aesop, symbolizes a number of proverbial, and in many cases, real Southern peasant values and traits: humility, obstinacy, patience, simplicity (Cooper, Illustrated 16). Ubiquitous in folktales of the Italian South, the donkey as protagonist made stories of their own troubles tolerable to the the peasants' ears (Mangione and Morreale 35). "Story of the Saint Joseph Donkey" is then a sophisticated folktale, an authentic expression of peasant consciousness. Like the Saint Joseph Donkey, as the least productive donkeys of the Mezzogiorno were known, peasants, regardless of their labors, were little valued, treated as nothing by the upper classes and government of their society, rendered mute in their resistance to authority by their inability to speak anything but a local dialect, by the power of feudal custom, and by brute force, (Viscusi, "Narrative" 80 82).1 Adding insult to injury, a nobleman might sarcastically call a peasant "Santu" ("Saint"), poking fun as his saintly poverty (Covello 79). What Verga gives us then is a triple analogy ? symbolic, serious, sarcastic ?of donkey, peasant, saint. His story recounts the life and death of one particular Saint Joseph Donkey. The Donkey, like the peasants, is treated as a commodity: an object valued for the work he can perform, an2d devalued to nothingness as he is able to perform less and less work. The Donkey's breeder spends an entire day haggling his price with the Donkey's first owner, Neli. "It's a beautiful colt," said the owner, "and he's worth more than thirty five lire. Don't pay attention to that black and white coat like a magpie's.. .In all honesty, I don't know where the colt got that magpie coat. But his build's good, believe me! You don't judge men by their faces. Look what a chest he's got! And those legs like pillars! Look how he holds his ears! When you have a donkey who keeps his ears that straight, you can put him to a cart or to a plow, just as you like, and make him carry four tumoli of buckwheat better than a mule, I swear by the holy day that's today! Feel this tail; you and your whole family could hang on it!" (Verga 149)</page><page sequence="9">158 Italian Americana The breeder denies the Donkey's individuality, his "magpie coat" and its association with saintliness, to take full economic advantage of him, to have his whole family, in an economic sense, hang on the donkey's tail. In Verga's Mezzogiorno, you don't judge donkeys by their coats or "men by their faces." The analogy becomes clear: the breeder in his prevarication, the landowners in their control, the Donkey in his sturdiness and compliance, the peasants in their nothingness. The analogy gains in clarity and force as the plot progresses. With each episode the Donkey becomes more of an individual, more human. As events unfold, we frequently see, hear, and feel them from the Donkey's perspective. "Meanwhile, [the Donkey] kept tripping along behind Neli, trying to bite his jacket for fun, as if he knew it was the jacket of his new owner, and as if he didn't care that he was forever leaving the stable where he had been warm beside his mother, where he had rubbed his muzzle on the edge of the manger, or had butted and capered with the ram, and had teased the pig in its little corner" (155). As the "colt" (156) and his labor change hands, he is gradually broken in both body and spirit. Eventually, he became so tired that he didn't even feel like biting into the pile of straw.. .Then he let his muzzle and his ears droop, like a full-grown donkey, his eyes lifeless, as if he were tired of looking at that vast white countryside which...seemed made only to let you die of thirst and to make you trot around on the sheaves. In the evening, he went back to the village with his saddlebags full, and the owner's boy kept pricking him in the withers, as they went along the path's hedges which seemed alive with the chirping of the titmice and the fragrance of catmint and rosemary, and the donkey would have liked to take a bite, if they hadn't made him trot all the time so that the blood went down to his legs and they had to take him to the farrier; but his owner didn't care at all, because the harvest had been good, and the colt had made his thirty-two and a half lire. (156) Like a peasant child made to work in the fields, the immature Donkey is prematurely exploited and downtrodden. Verga compares the Donkey explicitly to a human being in the episode at the farrier's, in which the Donkey "tried to break loose from the twisted rope which squeezed his lip, his eyes wild from the pain as if he were human" (157). Like the peasants, the Donkey falls further and further into misery. The narrator remarks, "And yet there are so many Christians who are no better off" than animals, the donkey and other beasts who "shielded themselves by huddling close together" under "stars that were shining like swords," beasts whose "harness sores shuddered and quivered in the cold as if they could speak" (162). The comparison is culturally apt as well as explicit, since, in Mezzogiorno society of the era, men and their beasts often worked, rested, and celebrated side by side (Manoukian 17). At story's end, the personified Donkey has suffered nearly to death. It is only then that he is given some comfort by "a poor widow, in a hut more broken down than the lime kiln itself, where the stars went through the roof like swords" (Verga 162). This old peasant woman lives under the same conditions as the Donkey, "as if she were in the open" (162); and she sees fit, despite her poverty, to care for him. The "poor Saint Joseph donkey was better off during his last days, since the widow kept him like a treasure, thanks to the money he had cost her, and at night she went</page><page sequence="10">Giovanni Verga and the Roots of Italian America 159 to find straw and hay for him, and kept him in the hut beside her bed, where he gave off heat like a little fire; and in this world one hand washes the other" (163). Here, the widow gives care based on affection, but at least as much on economic interdependence: the dual motivation of relations among members of the peasant family. Although, for example, children were, naturally, loved by their parents and siblings, they also were expected to work with the rest of the family as soon as they were able (Alba 32). Fathers, in return, were expected to earn the lion's share of family bread; and mothers, if and when they were not working in the fields, were expected to keep household order (Gambino, Blood 128-182). When the Donkey "knelt down just like the real Saint Joseph donkey in front of the Christ Child, and he didn't want to get up any more" (Verga 164), the widow and her own fever-stricken son are left without their only means of earning bread, the donkey, the one-time conveyance of the Christian world's savior. By this point in the narrative, the Donkey's treatment in death seems no worse than his treatment in life. A passerby tells the widow, "T'm buying only the wood, because here's all the donkey's worth...' And he kicked the carcass, which sounded like a broken drum" (164). The folkloric Donkey suffers and dies, the way centuries of Southern folk did, most often bound in thankless, hopeless, and endless servitude to their landowning masters, or, at best, to their own tiny pieces of land. Yet, to this land that both sustained them and sapped their strength, peasants remained true. Life there, like the familiar folktale, was the only story they knew: not necessarily a happy one, but one from which they could draw discernable themes and learn practical lessons. While it is true that many ultimately left, driven by economic crisis and the desire to improve their condition, they did so reluctantly (Nelli 31). Their village and its surroundings, every hovel, stone, and meadow, contained all they knew of history and life (Alba 28). Their attachment to their paesi, as oysters to rock, was a spiritual one, and at a distance, they conceived of those paesi as pastorals to which they would happily, must even, return. Prior to the 1880s, Southern Italian migration meant, in most cases, movement within the Italian peninsula. And most of the landless laborers who migrated, as was later the case with emigrants to America, were men. These men were typically giornalieri, day laborers. Ninety per cent of all male peasants belonged to this group (Mack Smith 149). These men moved from place to place, in pursuit of work, living away from their families most of the time (Alba 79). Such movement for economic survival finds expression in the Sicilian version of a folktale like those that influenced Verga, entitled "Out in the World." It begins, "There was a widow with two daughters and a son named Peppi, who was at a loss to earn his bread. While mother and daughters were spinning one day, Peppi said, 'Listen, Mother; with your leave, I am going out into the world'" (Calvino 616). Peppi represents the young, unmarried men who made up seventy-five per cent of emigrants from Mezzogiorno towns (Archdeacon 139; Douglass 101). Once out in the world, he works at first for room and board, and seeks money only in order to return to his family. He pleads with the landowner for whom he labors, "Carnival is coming, and you couldn't give me a little money just this one time so I could go and celebrate with my mother and sisters?" (Calvino 617). The landowner refuses to remunerate labor, a problem for Peppi, but an absolute barrier to upward mobility for late nineteenth-century peasants caught between feudalism and capitalism (Douglass 35-36; Mack Smith 148-57; Nelli 22-23), victims of the</page><page sequence="11">160 Italian Americana Mezzogiorno's near exclusion from the emerging international capitalist economy (Alba 38). While the Southern landowners themselves generally did not have enough capital to transform their latifondia from subsistence to market operations (Mack Smith 151), the landless Southern peasant could not even imagine such operations. The solution for Peppi is a sly, "tough" (Calvino 618), anthropomorphic ox, a symbol of peasant furberia, cleverness, and perseverence. The ox instructs Peppi to ask the master, who hates the ox, to give him to Peppi in place of money, which the master does. One day, Peppi hears a proclamation: "Whoever feels up to plowing fifty acres of land in one day's time will receive the King's daughter in marriage; or, in the event he's already married, two piles of Gold.. But whoever tries and fails, dies." (618). Peppi and the ox succeed in plowing fifty acres of land in a single day. The king is reluctant to marry his noble daughter to "that ugly peasant" (619), so he asks Peppi, '"What do you want, two piles of gold coins?'" To which Peppi replies, "T'm a bachelor, Majesty. What would I do with gold pieces? I've come for my wife'" (619). Once the king agrees, Peppi endears himself by slaughtering the ox, as the ox instructs him, for the wedding feast. Peppi kills off the symbol of his servitude, whose magical hoof causes his matrimonial bedchamber to grow "full of flowers and fruit out of season" (620). Peppi himself, a peasant at heart, is himself out of season as a noble living in a castle. Peppi's solution to poverty is characteristic of the folktale, with its pre-capitalistic sensibility (Propp 17). It is a solution that relies still on the graces of the galantuomini, the nobility. Such a solution was an unlikely one for the real peasants of the Mezzogiorno; and for Peppi it is only temporary. After his wedding, his sisters and brothers-in-law conspire to rob him of his money, by exploiting his trust. They learn the secret of his fertility from his wife, wager him that they know it, and when they win the wager, literally send him packing, "set out dressed as a peasant and carrying his knapsack" (Calvino 621). Only Peppi's initiative and his curiosity restore him to his fortune and wife. He goes off in quest of the Sun, through a series of fantastic feats comes to speak with it, and bargains with it to set at an unusual hour, so that he can win back his possessions from his in-laws, as they had done from him. Upon winning this second wager, Peppi initially refuses his reward, announcing to the court, "T intend to show you the heart of a peasant' ? as they still called him.. .T have no desire for the property of others, but only for my own'" (622). When the king hears this, he "insisted on embracing [Peppi] and, removing his crown, placed it on Peppi's head...So goes the story of Peppi, who started out as a starving cowherd and ended up the wealthiest and happiest of kings" (622). Peppi renounces property gained through trickery, and ultimately gains it through humility and abstention, enacting the values and virtues practical only in the Italy of a folktale. A more realistic portrayal of values, but still not representative of reality, is Mazzar?'s obsessive acquisition of property in Verga's "Property." Of course, Mazzar?'s degree of success would have been nearly as rare for a peasant as Peppi's crown. "Out in the World," then, inculcates the peasant virtues of hard work, humility, initiative, perseverance, but it does not offer a realistic solution to peasant problems. That solution could exist only outside of the society in which such tales were widely told. It would be left to the peasants who took part in the great emigration of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; who, although they did not share Peppi's means, shared his values and virtues.</page><page sequence="12">Giovanni Verga and the Roots of Italian America 161 The actual peasants who became the great emigration were not of the lowest economic class. They were those peasants who feared falling into the abyss of poverty, spinti, driven, or, literally, pushed, to improve their lot. As one American official of the era stated, "One of the complaints of the present day of the Italian officials is that the very best young blood of the Italian plebes is going out of the country. They recognize that fact. It is the man with the initiative who leaves" (McLaughlin qtd in Nelli 33). In danger of being driven over the brink of indigence by a rash of economic disasters?the unfair redistribution of lands and the dissolution of feudal ties, combined with the effects of extended drought, pervasive phylloxera, overproduction of agricultural products (especially wine and wheat), burdensome taxes, and the restrictive agricultural trade policies of the Italian government? nearly twenty million Italians, full of hope for a brighter economic future, emigrated (from 1861 to 1940) from an Italy that in 1901 contained a population of only thirty three million (Sori 19). Most of these, young men alone, planned to return and buy pieces of their native soil. Most of the immigrants to the United States, ninety percent of whom came from the Mezzogiorno (Nelli 32), had never ventured beyond their villages; when they arrived in America, they found themselves alone or with just a few people who spoke their language; and they were, most often, illiterate. As the immigrants who remained in the New World ? approximately half of those who came (Archdeacon 137-140)?would discover, literacy in English, at least a degree of literacy, was tantamount to success in America. Understandably, the trope of literacy is central to Italian immigrant autobiography. To understand why the autobiographers held literacy out as a symbol of success in early twentieth century America, one needs to understand that in the United States, then as now, productivity depended upon oral and written communication. Such was not necessarily the case in Italy, where in 1901, the illiteracy rate was 70 per cent in Campania, 69.5 per cent in Apulia, 75.4 per cent in Basilicata, 78.7 per cent in Calabria, and 70.9 per cent in Sicily (Covello 246). A problem for the Italian immigrants, the "birds of passage" ? so-called by Americans, most of whom did not believe they could assimilate (Alba 40)?were the vast and many differences between the two societies of which they would take part: Post-Risorgimento Italy and Gilded Age/Progressive Era America. The peasants came from a rural, feudal, rigidly stratified society governed by unwritten, traditional laws of community and local allegiances. They arrived in an increasingly urban, capitalistic, mobile society governed, at least in theory, by official legislation. In his 1995 novel, Astoria, Robert Viscusi crystallizes their dilemma: "A whole nation walked out of the middle ages, slept in the ocean, and awakened in New York in the twentieth century" (22). While contradicting the Italian government's official encouragement of emigration during the period in question, "Gli emigrant!," by Emilio Salgari (1863 1911), a newspaper account of the immigrants' passage to America, provides a telling Italian perspective on the peasants' disjuncture. Many times you have heard talk of those poor peasants who, without means of earning their bread in their own little paesi, go to seek their fortune in distant America, and perhaps you have seen many of them depart, crowding onto train cars, carrying their few rags, their last bit of wealth.</page><page sequence="13">162 Italian Americana Those wretches, before reaching America, must cross an immense ocean, the Atlantic, and travel twenty-five days, sometimes thirty, aboardship. We present to you now a scene of emigration. Look at all those peasants, who have abandoned our beautiful Italy, gathered together in the hold of a ship. With them are their women and children. It's dinnertime. All crowd around the cooks and the sailors to receive their bowls of soup. But the ocean is not calm, and the ship, tossed by the waves, bounces around wildly, jostling everyone. The bowls overturn, children fall to the floor, losing their soup, others cling to their mommies' skirts and howl with fright, or they are helped by their older brothers and sisters, while the parents run back and forth, everywhere, for fear of going without dinner. At sea, these are veryday occurences, scenes played out over and over again, which try the patience and the hunger of those poor peasants. But finally, the ocean crossed, the coastline of America is in sight, they debark onto those distant shores. But how many disillusionments often await them there, and how many return to their fatherland poorer than they left! (translation mine) (Savana and Straniero 341) Given the trauma of the their experience, we can easily understand how Italy, the familiar, must have returned, again and again, as an ideal society to those who remained in the Italian colonies of America. Notes 1. Robert Viscusi, in "Narrative and Nothing/' illuminates the peasants' experience of nothingness, its role in understanding the society Verga portrays, and its impact on immigrant and later Italian American authors. The cafoni [peasants], unlike the authorities, do not need to be divided among themselves in order to be rendered harmless. Their separation is of a different kind. They are removed from the drama of power by three layers of Nothing. And even these are precise. At the top, under the guards and dogs, there is that Nothing closest to the rich and powerful. Let us call this The Nothing of the Deaf: in Vontamara [Ignazio Silone's twentieth-century novel of peasant life], the rich systematically misinterpret what the cafoni say, insisting that every request for help is an act of transgression, and the treating a desperate plea for water as if it were an act of revolutionary terrorism. At the bottom, just above the cafoni, there is the Nothing of those who cannot represent themselves. Let us call the The Nothing of the Mute: the cafoni do not know what to say even when they say it. They arrive at the festival carrying the wrong flag, their clothes are laughable, their accent is sidesplittingly awkward. After all, they cannot, actually cannot, speak the language of the nation, but only the local tongue belonging to their narrow little crevasse in the primeval hills?what is called a dialect but has in practice the effect of a visible stigma. They speak with a wordlist and a cantilena that mark them out as simply not worth listening to, mark them out no less vividly than a bright red tattoo across the mouth. Then there is the middle Nothing. It stands for that which cannot even attempt to speak or to hear. This is The Nothing of the Dead: it represents that which ought to be there but is not. It represents those who have so totally failed to claim a right to existence that they have either died or emigrated, or both..."
