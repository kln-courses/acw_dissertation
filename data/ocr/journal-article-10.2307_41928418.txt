History, in the case of Tibet, is the only form of study capable of coherently inte- grating the known facts of its civilization with knowledge obtained from other disci- plines. In the general introduction ( vol. I, pp. 1-16), which presents an outline of the work, the Editor of the three volumes makes clear his hopes that his work can help in highlighting the great importance of historical studies. A definition that he ex- tracts from a passage of one of the late Michael Aris's lectures (vol. I, p. 1) "Hie History of Tibet: Old bones and New blood", unpublished conference abstract, (His- tory of Tibet conference), Oxford 1997. The reason for this is that there are many different Tibets (vol. I, p. 2), and many different levels of reading such as the mythical, religious, political, ethnic, Buddhist, communist etc. In order to present the different factors that together formed the Tibetan civilization, from a historical perspective, the Editor has collected in these three volumes an anthology of studies relating to Tibetan history that respects the chronological criteria of those same Tibetan authors that divide their country's his- tory in the two great periods of the first and the second spread of Buddhism. In the aforementioned general introduction, the Editor presents his intentions and methods of including certain studies and excluding others and clearly states wanting to represent them through the "state of the field" of this discipline. During the late twentieth century Tibetan studies have greatly increased, some of which have changed what was previously known about certain aspects of Tibetan culture. One of the objectives of this collection is therefore a revision of academic knowledge, es- pecially Western knowledge, regarding Tibetan history (vol. I p. 3), although many of the chosen contributions date back up to at least twenty years ago. More use of CAJ 50/1 (2006)</page><page sequence="2">134 Reviews archaeological and anthropological sources, more attention paid to the current issue of national minority rights, and a more critical study of Buddhist texts and of writings regarding the history of Tibet's conversion are all elements that have formed a more balanced approach to the subject in recent years. Further light is shed on the fact that Western concepts have commonly been used to interpret events that arose from a completely different context, and that there is a methodological contrast between European studies that favour philology and Ameri- can studies that favour problems regarding cultural identity. In order to define which material should be included in this anthology the Editor has used a definition of "Tibet" that is consistent with "political Tibet", though the Editor specifies that "po- litical Tibet" does not indicate a centralized national state (vol. I, p. 3). It is impor- tant to remember that with the introduction of monasticism Tibetan society greatly changed from the past monarchic period. In fact there was a loss of that sense of na- tional identity so typical of a populace that recognises itself as a nation living in a clearly defined territory, (see Samten Karmay, "Mountain cults and national identity in Tibet", pp. 112-120 in R. Barnett - S. Akiner, Resistance and Reform in Tibet , London 1994) The most recurrent problem in searching for a suitable definition of "Tibet" is the very fact that Tibetan culture never developed a concept of nationhood in relation to a clearly defined territorial area that delimited its authority and juris- diction: from the thirteenth century to halfway through the twentieth century the Buddhist message as a cultural model was itself the unifying factor of Tibetan socie- ty- While still on the subject of suitably defining "Tibet" and choosing which mate- rial to include in the anthology, the Editor notes that, although the complex inter- relation between the central government and regional units in their political and religious functions, suggest that the dGe lugs pa (here termed "the Lhasa-centric con- struction") was not the only political model but it was necessary to use that model as a benchmark and exclude those studies regarding areas that were independent and autonomous albeit ethnically and culturally Tibetan such as Ladakh, Khams and Amdo, in order to depict the history of these peoples, at least in their relationship with the Lhasa government. It is important to note that the concept of political Tibet does not always coincide with the concept of ethnic and geographic Tibet. Many of the works collected in the anthology have already been published else- where, but generally in hard to find editions while very few are published for the first time. These works have been chosen in order to present the best academic studies re- garding Tibetan history, and avoiding those works that see the subject through lenses misted by deviating mythical images such as the a-historical image of Tibet as "Shangri la" (vol. I, p. 6), but with lenses firmly aimed towards real events and with the complete awareness of sometimes showing contrasts in reality between Buddhist ideals and human nature, the two factors whose interaction produced a society with a unique and unparalleled civilization (vol. I, p. 16). In the opinion of the writer of this article, in order to do justice to the values of this millenarian society it is important to consider, as the principal reading key for CAJ 50/1 (2006)</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 135 the entire historical process, what Michael Aris writes in the preface to Dan Martin, Tibetan Histories , A Bibliography of Tibetan-Language Historical Works , London 1997, p. 12: "... When rationalism and scepticism have had their way with the rec- ords we are still left with the astonishing resilience of the bodhisattva ideal that pro- vided the inspiration behind so many of the human institutions of Tibet and its di- verse forms of rule and succession. As often as the ideal appears to wither and decay, so does it reassert itself in the accounts of individual lives and institutions. Founded on the solid rock of private and public morality and on the conviction that the relief of human suffering is both essential and attainable, the same exemplar found many highly convincing expressions in Tibetan history." According to the Editor, Tibetan studies present different methods of approaching Tibetan civilization that develop, and sometimes diverge, from the " Classical Line- age " of Charles Bell, Hugh Richardson and Giuseppe Tucci. This Traditional model , still followed by many academics, represents the perspective of the former Lhasa ruling class while a Buddhist model , based on a rigorous study of texts, still remains today the basis to approaching Tibetan academic studies. From the progress made on studying Bon a Nativist model has also emerged, that studies mainly the most an- cient period of Tibetan culture and also the Shamanist model , that recognizes the characteristic peculiarities of Tibetan civilization (vol. I, p. 13) as the result of the meeting between Central- Asian shamanistic tendencies and Buddhist monasticism. The articles have been arranged according to chronological order that corresponds to the ancient, medieval and modern periods. Besides the general introduction in the first volume, each of the three volumes opens with an interesting introduction in which the Editor discusses, based on the chosen works, the main themes regarding the examined periods and also tries to single out possible directions for future stud- ies. While this is not the place to give credit to every single piece it is important to give a short summary on how the Editor has arranged the collected material. The first volume is entirely dedicated to the ancient history of Tibet, that chro- nologically coincides with the snga dar period (or first spread of Buddhism) and ends with the dissolution of the Yarlung dynasty. Three aspects are particularly examined: 1) the historic and cultural process that transformed small tribal clans into a pan- Asiatic power, 2) the reasons behind the fall of the empire and the centralised ad- ministration that it had created, 3) the development of the socio-cultural elements of Tibetan civilization, paying particular attention to the religious system (vol. I, p. 19). Ancient customs and mythology, see chapters nn. 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20, 21, the historical aspects of the Yarlung monarchy, see chapters nn.l, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 25, 26, 27, and the Pre-Buddhist Bon religion, see chapters nn. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, are all given great attention to. Three of the works are devoted to interpreting the Dunhuang manuscripts, see chapters nn. 5, 13, 14, while only two regard archaeology and art, see chapters nn. 4, 24, and only one regards the pre- historic period by the study of Tibetan megalithic structures, see chapter 3. CAJ 50/1 (2006)</page><page sequence="4">136 Reviews The first volume comes to the conclusion that during the monarchic period Bud- dhism was only one of the many religious elements in Tibetan society and with little evidence of it being the most widespread religion among the people. What does seem very likely is that at the time of Srong btsan sgam po (569-649), the first historical king, the Buddhist religion was introduced for solely political reasons strictly associated with the dynasty (vol. I, p. 29). Among the final considerations it is interesting to highlight Beckwith's theory according to which the origins of the Tibetans is to be looked for in the autochthon peoples of the Tibetan high plateaux and not in the migration of the Ch'iang population (vol. I, p. 21). It is worth re- membering the second reading of the Srin mo myth, because of its relation to the so- called "gender studies" that reflect upon the social position of women, due to the political implications of the myth, reflecting the imposition of a new system in place of the Pre-Buddhist beliefs, and also especially due to its anthropomorphic vision of nature (vol. I, p. 31). The second volume discusses the events following the second spread of Bud- dhism. This period is considered as lasting from the fall of Monarchy to the advent of the thirteenth Dalai Lama Thub bstan rgya mtsho (1876-1933) in 1895. This follows the vision of Tibet as The Buddhist Tibet in which the main events are the establishment and circulation of monasticism alongside the rise of theocratic ele- ments in the country's social structure and the substitution of hereditary succession of monastic rank by the theory of incarnation which culminates with the coming to power of the Dalai Lama. The introduction (vol. II, p. 1) immediately focuses on the fragmentation of the kingdom by indicating that period following the fall of Monarchy as "the local Hegemonic period" (see vol. II, chapter n. 43), an event paralleled with the collapse of the Uighur empire in 840 and of the Chinese T'ang dynasty in 905 (vol. II, p. 1). This period, commonly termed as "...a dark period..." for lack of written sources should, in fact, be seen as a period of great activity within the socio-political-reli- gious sphere (vol. II, p. 12). In the introduction to the second volume the Editor underscores the most important factors of the first period of the phyi dar under the patronage of the king Ye shes 'od of Gu ge (Western Tibet) and in the effort of the systematic collection of Indian Buddhist texts that he rightly defines as "...an extra- ordinary knowledge-gathering project", behind which we can definitely recognize, alongside genuine religious fervour, the Indian pandit's desire to spread the doctrine in places sheltered from Muslim raids. Nor should we forget the economic motiva- tions, for the study of which, the Editor points out (vol. II, p. 3 and p. 16) we lack an economic history of Tibet. The contributions to the second volume regard different themes: 1) among those regarding Western Tibet and the second spread of Buddhism, see chapters nn. 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 45, we note the important contribution of Roberto Vitali, n. 37, here published for the first time concerning the chronology of western Tibet. Chapter n. 39 shows, as already pointed out, how the phyi dar was a phenomenon that also interested the far North-Eastern lands of the country with the conversion of the Ho CAJ 50/1 (2006)</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 137 hsi tribes who enjoyed the Sung's patronage. 2) The practise of devotional pil- grimage, tied to the magical tranformation of places, studied not only from a reli- gious perspective but also from a political one, is the subject of chapters nn. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 56, 71. 3) The Mongol period is presented in chapters nn. 52, 53. Although most subjects on the historical period examined in the second volume fol- low an already established historical tradition, chapter n. 53 by Luciano Petech pre- sents a few innovations. The second chapter's version of "The central Tibet and the Mongols: the Yuan-Sa skya period of Tibetan history ", Serie Orientale Roma, Rome 1990, here presented with the title: "The establishment of the Yuan-Sa skya partner- ship", pp. 338-361, has been significantly revised by the Author. The following, short reflection may give an idea of the extent of the revision that redimensions the image of Thags pa as a person of power: "When the Mongol-Sa skya partnership eventually became a reality, it was something different, with an effective exercise of the qagan's ruling powers." See vol. II, p. 340. The following themes are also explored: 4) the relationship between protected and protector ( mchod-yon ) is examined as a religious-socio-political concept in chapter n. 54 and in relation to the establishment of dGe lugs pa monasteries and their ad- versaries in chapter n. 60; 5) the political activities of the various Tibetan Buddhist schools during the Ming period is the theme of chapters nn. 55, 58, 59, while the period of transition between the Yuan and Ming dynasties is explored in the con- tribution on Byang chub rgyal mtshan (1302-64), chapter n. 57, and also in chapter n. 73 in relation to a study on the Chi Kya tribe, situated in the geographical area around the great sKu 'bum monastery in Amdo. 6) The Dalai Lama and their institu- tion in their relative historical periods are the subject of chapters nn. 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70, while for the political roles of the Tibetan Buddhist schools the Editor chooses an article by Richardson, chapter n. 44. 7) The two Jinchuan wars of 1747-9 and 1771-6 are examined in the chapters nn. 68, 69 also in relation to their conse- quences on the Bon po communities, and chapter n. 72 is dedicated to the Bon tradi- tion in Amdo; 8) the aspects of the early Tibetan encounter with the West are ex- amined in the following chapters nn. 75, 76, 77, 78. 9) Chapter n. 61 proves how the Western definition of nationalism is clearly inadequate in defining a fact, that George Dreyfus calls protonationalism, that has existed in Tibet at least since the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries. In the introduction, vol II, p. 17, the Editor seizes the opportunity, while commenting on this chapter, to say that The Tibet studied in these volumes is not: "a Tibet defined or united by the fixed boundaries of modern nation states, but by shared concepts of identity, not least those vis à vis an other". He returns again to this idea of the different conception of state/nation in Europe and in Tibet during the introduction to vol. Ill, p. 13. 10) Chapter n.74 deals with that particular phenomenon known as Ris med that gathers the different religious ex- periences of the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism in one great movement deter- mined to supersede all sectarianisms. Chapter n. 96 of vol. ID also presents the bio- graphy of a Ris med pa. CAJ 50/1 (2006)</page><page sequence="6">138 Reviews The third volume examines the studies on the period that begins at the end of the XIX century up to the flight to India by the XIV Dalai Lama in 1959. It particularly discusses the politics adopted by foreign powers in dealing with Tibet and the rela- tions that the Tibetan government tried to establish with them. The contributions primarily regard the following themes: 1) the politics of the XIII Dalai Lama; 2) Tibet's involvement in the great game between imperialistic powers; 3) the reasons behind the Chinese invasion of 1950. Chapters nn. 84, 85, 86, 87, 95, 103, 104 regard the relationship with the En- glish. The Editor points out how there is a lack of studies regarding the Tibetan point of view on this subject since the Tibetan sources have yet to be explored. Chapters nn. 80, 81 concern the relationship with Tsarist Russia. From here emerges how the Buriat monk Agvan Dorzhiev (1854-1930) was an envoy from Lhasa to the Tsar and not vice versa, while chapter n. 106 is a reminder of how Soviet Russia attempted to maintain open contact with Tibet against the English. The relationship with Mongolia is the subject of chapters n. 89, 90, 107 where there is also discussion on the vision of a pan-Buddhist state, a vision that had also at- tracted Sir Charles Bell, at the time the English diplomat responsible for Tibetan relations. Chapters nn. 82, 88, 110, 117, 118 deal with Tibet's relationships with China and describe the various phases of their progressive disintegration. It is inter- esting to note how the Tibetan government considered "the symbolic overlordship of China" as a deterrent towards other powers (vol. HI, p. 1-2). The volume closes with the modern Western vision of Tibet and Tibetan Bud- dhism and this part is of great interest even for non specialists in this subject, see chapters nn. 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126. In the third volume the Editor includes those works which highlight the meetings between Tibet and the modern world. As the title claims the volume on the modern period begins with the coming to power of the XIII Dalai Lama in 1895 (vol. Ill, p. 3). We note that this date is also important in the Asiatic context relating to the debate on modernization. After the treaty of Shimonoseki (1895) China finds interest in western thought and the new western ideas and a great number of European and American works begin to be trans- lated. (see: W. Idema, L. Haft, Letteratura Cinese - Chinese Literature , Venezia Libreria Editrice Cafoscarina, 2000). In the introduction to the volume the editor presents the geopolitical situation which the XIII and XIV Dalai Lama had to face. The Editor's first consideration is that, despite the presence of Ambans in Lhasa since 1895, the Tibetan government considered Tibet an autonomous country and recognized China as a purely symbolic form of authority (vol. ID, p. 1). It is no coincidence that the English defined the idea of nominal sovereignty, during the Simla Convention in 1914, with the feudal name Suzerainty as opposed to the concept of absolute sovereignty, invested with juridical power, that is expressed by the name Sovereignty (see vol. IH, p. 33, note 8 and 95 and Dawa Norbu, China's Tibet policy , Richmond Curzon 2001, p. 166). CAJ 50/1 (2006)</page><page sequence="7">Reviews 139 It is through the commentary on the chosen contributions that the Editor de- scribes the events of the historical process that eventually led to the "Tibetan affair" greatly discussed after having granted the Nobel peace prize to bsTan dzin rgya mtsho, the XIV Dalai Lama, and that today seems to be dramatically forgotten in the midst of the terrible events of international terrorism. The author tackles the complexity of the subject not only with the inclusion of "technical" contributions such as chapter n. 84 on the Simla convention or those regarding the 17 point accord of 1951, in chapters nn. 117, 118, but also with the inclusion of microhistorical contributions such as chapters nn. 83, 92, 93, 94, 99, 101, 109, 116. Chapters nn. 79, 102, 111, 112, 113 tackle a more delicate subject: How the more conservative monastic powers, opposed the XIII Dalai Lama's attempts to modernize Tibet in order to maintain their privileges. In fact the many machinations of the Thub bastan rgya mtsho government period from its very beginning elucidates the probable political climate of the time with rivalling factions and a social conduct of the ruling classes that can be considered not completely moral. One of the still most debated arguments regards the responsibility of the same XIII Dalai Lama who, despite having begun the process of modernization of his country, later abandoned it during the mid- 1 920' s, instead dedicating his reforms to centralizing power in his own hands (vol. Ill, p. 3, 15, 19). More on the accounts that bear witness to the process of modernization can be found in chapters nn. 99, 100, 101. Some unusual but very interesting themes are the subjects of chapters n. 91, where John Bray describes the complicated situation of the Ladakhi and Bhutanesi enclaves in Tibetan territory, chapter n. 97 by Scott Berry on the relations between Tibet and Japan, and chapter n. 105 by Fabienne Jagou, on the travels of the sixth Pan chen Lama Bio bzang chos kyi nyi ma (1883-1937) during his exile. Finally, chapters nn. 108 and 109 present two contributions on the different per- spectives of those missionaries who tried to reach central Tibet. This laudable work is enriched with useful charts and an added bibliography at the end of the third volume. The lack of graphical unification in the introductions, where the phonetic spelling is commonly accompanied by the scientific spelling, is some- what incomprehensible: as an example, vol. I, p. 20 Songsten Gampo (Srong tsen sgam po) instead of Song tsen Gam po (Srong btsan sgam po); p. 23 Bon with a dieresis upon the o (vol. II, p. 32 Bon presents no dieresis) but if the dieresis is put in the phonetic spelling Bon becomes Pon; p. 26 Lang Darma (gLang dar-ma) in- stead of Glang dar ma, which in vol. II p. 7 becomes Lang Dharma; p. 34 different spellings for Ral pa can and Ral pa chan? (also on p.40); p. 39 gcug instead of gtsug; p. 40 gcen instead of gshen, but Gshen at p. 38 (corrected it is gShen); p. 56 bLon instead of Blon; p. 57 kLu mes instead of Klu mes; vol. II p. 11 gNam thar misprinted as rnam thar; p. 15 Dga' ldan instead of dGa' ldan; p. 16 Tashilumpo (bKra shis lun po) instead of (bKra shis Ihun po); p. 17 Tsong khapa instead of Tsong kha pa, etc.; vol ID p. 1 Taksta Rinpoche is the phonetic spelling? of the ruler rTa tshag sprul sku Ngag dbang chos kyi rgyal mtshan (1875-1886), and so on. CAJ 50/1 (2006)</page><page sequence="8">140 Reviews The Sanskrit words sometimes have long vowels and sometimes do not, for example in vol. II p. 7, some names have been misprinted such as Per Sorenson instead of Per S0rensen (vol. I, xix), Eva Dargay instead of Eva Dargyay (vol. I p.33), Csomo de Koros instead of Csoma de Koros (vol. I p. 42), Kutnetsov instead of Kuznetsov (vol. I p. 37). But I do believe that we are all quite willing to forgive him for this since these three volumes are a truly extraordinary tool for Tibetan stud- ies and all scholars of this subject, not solely historians, will be deeply grateful to him for a long time to come.
