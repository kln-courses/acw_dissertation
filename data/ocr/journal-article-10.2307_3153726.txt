<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SUPERNATURAL Modem thought recognizes that its legitimate activity is confined to the limits of human experience. As with all other objects, so it is with the supernatural. We can have valid knowledge of it only as it enters or is implied in our experience. Within this, the proper sphere of thought, science has made remarkable progress in the last century, extending the operation of natural law to provinces before believed to be quite beyond its scope. Thus it has become hazardous to find evidences of the super- natural in particular events which seem impossible of natural explanation. For the triumphant scientist surprises us by discovering this explanation, and the vanquished theologian is forced to leave the field and seek else- where for traces of the divine. With good reason, therefore, enlightened theists are abandoning the order of events for the order of values. They find in man's moral nature, his ideals and aspirations, a truly super-</page><page sequence="2">SOME INTERPRETATIONS OF THE SUPERNATURAL 359 natural principle which they use, not as a cause for this or that fact in nature, but as a key to the significance of the universe as a whole. Thus Henry T. Clark approaches the problem of religion and the object of religious belief from the ethical standpoint. He proposes to treat religion, not as a science of God and his relation to man, but as an art, the "art of character-production. " His book' is itself evidence that the Christian religion is primarily a mode of life and conduct, rather than a system of science or philosophy. For not only does the author make the claims of Christianity in the practical sphere seem most reasonable and convincing, but he is also led by the logic of his standpoint to suggest a view of God and the world in substantial harmony with the modern conception. Man's supreme end is self-realization. Possessed of intelligence as the outcome of a long evolution, man should be united in sympathy and love to that Infinite Intelligence which is the ultimate source of the whole development. "God wanted the end to be linked back to the beginning again." But man by his self-will has prevented this adjustment. It now requires a moral reconstruction of human nature. This is made, possible only through the fatherhood of God, the communication by God of his moral qualities to man. In the incarnation God thus imparts his nature to man. God descends to meet the ascending evolution of man. Christ not merely reveals, he "communicates" God. Hence, when man personally identifies himself with Christ, he attains divine sonship. Such faith in Christ involves the persistent pursuit of goodness and enables man to reach complete self- realization. Mr. Clark writes eloquently and persuasively. His argument would be stronger and more complete if he had pointed out in his chapter on "Christian Self-Culture" how identification with Christ involves for man the realization of a definite ideal of service and self-sacrifice. But, on the whole, the book possesses rare merit, having a freshness of inspiration and a cogency of thought quite unusual among works of its class. But the tendency to base belief in the supernatural upon man's ethical aspirations may be pushed so far that religion is reduced to a moral senti- ment. M. Marcel HWbert virtually identifies belief in God with reverence for the moral ideal. His recent worka is a psychological study of the religious consciousness. This consciousness has, he holds, three main types-the predominantly emotional, intellectual, and practical. He analyzes these types in their order. Religion, he concludes, is an expression 1 The Philosophy of Christian Experience. By Henry T. Clark. Chicago: Revell. 243 pages. $1.25. 2 Le divin experience et hypothase. Par Marcel He'bert.

Through it we safeguard and consecrate that ideal of perfection whose authority over us nothing in experience suffices to explain. But while we are justified in attributing objective reality to the Perfect, we are not justified in attrib- uting to it personality. What corresponds to the ideal in ultimate reality must remain forever unknown. M. Hebert is a keen analyst, and has gathered an abundance of interesting material for dissection and study. In developing his views he takes many different standpoints, and hence his treatment impresses one as well balanced and complete. But further examination does not fully confirm this impression. His discussions are brief and seldom thorough. In fact, the element notably lacking in his work is depth and profundity of thought. His treatment of belief in the personality of God well illustrates this. In discussing the arguments in favor of such a belief he mentions only the traditional "proofs" and never alludes to the stronger arguments furnished by modern idealism. He next makes a short excursus into history and connects belief in a divine person- afrty with anthropomorphic superstitions. Then he asks if the idea of personalify is necessary to the thought of the Infinite or Perfect. Because cases are recorded where this thought is not accompanied by the idea of personality, he reaches his final conclusion that personal existence is not essential to the perfect. In this case what may seem to be completeness of treatment is only superficiality, and the discussion is as unconvincing as it is inadequate. There are those who believe that the present tendency to identify the supernatural with the Perfect is itself only a passing stage in human thought. M. Henri Guyot predicts that when morality shall receive a scientific explanation, no predicate will be left to God but his infinity. As the truly infinite, God will then be equal to the All, the indeterminate, an empty ideal without specific quality. But Mr. Guyot has written a historical and not a philosophical treatise.3 In it he investigates the origin of the idea of infinity as applied to God. He shows how Greek thought after some hesitation decided in the systems of Plato and Aristotle for a perfect but determinate First Principle. It was Philo the Jew who, influenced by the tradition of his race, introduced the idea of a God all-powerful and indeterminate. This conception was opposed by Plutarch and the Neo- Pythagoreans. But Plotinus accepted it, and God became for him the infinite and incomprehensible. M. Guyot's work deals with the same important period in the development of theology that Dr. Caird reviews 3 L'infinite divine depuis Philon le Juif jusqu'4 Plotin. Par Henri Guyot.

Such works are valuable contributions both to theology and to philosophy. Despite the success of science in explaining all events, both physical and psychical, by natural causation, Professor J. H. Hyslop believes that he and his co-workers in "psychical research" have brought to light phenom- ena which must be referred for explanation to a supernatural agency.4 Professor Hyslop regards belief in a future life as the foundation of our moral and social system. Hence it is extremely important to obtain evidence of the existence of such a life. This can be done only by establishing com- munication with discarnate spirits. At present mediumistic communica- tion is the most practicable method. The author then gives an account of the investigations made by Sir Oliver Lodge, Dr. Richard Hodgson, and himself, along with many others, in the case of Mrs. Piper. He thinks that the communications made by her can be explained only by telepathy or the existence of spirits. He chooses the spiritistic hypothesis as much more reasonable and in better accord with the facts. In a second volumes Pro- fessor Hyslop aims to enlighten the general reader upon questions of psy- chology involved in "psychical research." Since this is his purpose, it is unfortunate that he does not write more clearly. Many of his sentences are so obscure and confused as to be almost unintelligible. The closing chapter contains an earnest plea to the scientist to sacrifice his "aristocratic " tastes and take up the problem of a future life which has vital interest for all mankind. Mr. Joseph Hamilton thinks that we have not only proof of the existence of a supernatural world, but also knowledge of its inhabitants and govern- ing laws.6 He bases his views almost entirely upon the accounts given in the Bible of angelic visitations, miraculous events, etc. It is astonishing what an elaborate structure he rears on their foundations. The supernatural world he conceives on the analogy of the natural. Apparently it is located somewhere in space; for we are asked to imagine that visitors from this supernatural realm have had sight keen enough to "steer their course through labyrinths of suns and systems until this earth was discerned as a faint speck of light on the far horizon." The angelic beings who inhabit this sphere have bodies like the human, only more ethereal; senses like the 4 Science and a Future Life. By James H. Hyslop. Boston: Turner, 1905. x+372 pages. $1.50.

Fancies like these are multiplied, and curious speculations abound. It would be useless to bring up the question of evidence here, for the author says he has no com- mon ground with those who do not accept unreservedly every statement in the Bible. Moreover, one is bound to respect the reverence with which he approaches his subject, and the frank and earnest manner in which he avows his beliefs. But he should be reminded why other inquirers, as little materialists as he, will regard his conception of the supernatural as not merely unfounded, but also thoroughly unreasonable. If the progress of thought has taught us anything, it is that the existence of the supernatural can be established only by proving that the finite categories of science (matter and motion, cause and effect, etc.) are inadequate to explain reality, and hence must be supplemented by higher principles. The final interpretation of reality, we thus maintain, must be in terms of spirit and personality. How illogical and absurd it will be, therefore, to conceive of the supernatural in those very terms whose imperfection and finitude we have recognized-as a realm in space where bodies act and interact as they do in the present world!
