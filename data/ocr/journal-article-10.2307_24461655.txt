<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT BUDDHISTS AND CHRISTIANS ARE TEACHING EACH OTHER ABOUT GOD Stafford Betty Ht a time when the Judaeo-Christian conception of a personal God is coming under attack by Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins—the present-day Big Dogs of Atheism—theists would do well to pay attention to their Buddhist Brothers and sisters to see if there is any help from that quarter. Might there be a way of revi sioning God in such a way that God escapes the contemptuous critique of these outraged atheists? Buddhists, on the other hand, would do well to look at a chastened theism to see if there is help from that quarter. If Buddhism has a weakness—and what religion does not?—it is in the way it regards the person: the concept of "person," said the Buddha, is a con venient fiction at best, and the source of all our woes at worst. Most peo ple find this a little chilly. And Buddhism's most popular contemporary apologists are aware of this. Thus they experiment with a new way of rendering not only persons but Buddha Nature itself. I will try to show here that Buddhism and Christianity not only have much to teach each other about Ultimate Reality—God or Buddha Nature—but that the pro cess of cross-fertilization is already underway. Pope John Paul II angered many Buddhists around the world when he wrote in 1995 that Buddhism is an "atheistic" system and that "the doctrines of salvation in Buddhism and Christianity are opposed." Hurt feelings aside, was he correct? You could argue that he was if we restrict ourselves to the origi nal teachings of the Buddha, which the Pope apparently did. But 108 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="2">STAFFORD BETTY contemporary Buddhism has a less alien face. This ancient religion, which predates Christianity by 500 years, is undergoing a dramatic renaissance in the West, as any stroll through your local bookstore's Religion section will reveal, and we might be curious to learn why. Part of this renaissance shows itself in its evolving assessment of God. No doubt the Buddhist-Christian dialogue has enticed Buddhism's most creative thinkers to reach out toward Christians and Jews on the God question; no doubt Buddhists would like to show us that the impasse the Pope referred to is resolvable. Is it? The Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) implies that it just might be—at least for Catholic Christians. "Nor does divine Providence deny the help necessaiy for salvation to those who, without blame on their part, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, but who strive to live a good life, thanks to His grace," says the Council's Consti tution on the Church. The document does not mention Buddhism by name, but it is clear that the authors had it in mind. Buddhists, of course, would see this statement as condescending, as indeed it is. But those who know the history of the Church would also recognize it as a great departure from the Church of old, which did not hesitate to condemn Buddhists as lost to salvation. This change derived from the simple fact that many of the Church's theologians had familiarized themselves with Buddhism and recognized its power to transform human character in ways that were demonstrably good, even without any overt reference to God. What was obvious to these theologians is even more obvious today. Contemporary American Buddhists like Jack Kornfield, Thubten Chodron, and Lama Surya Das write brilliantly and inspiringly of the traditions that they have adopted. They are joined by a retinue of foreign Buddhists, such as the prolific Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, who has meditation centers all over the United States and Europe. And, of course, the Dalai Lama needs no introduction. All five of these teachers agree at the outset that Buddhism is non theistic if by God one means something very specific and defin able—such as a Supreme Being who created the universe and requires us to "know, love, and serve Him" in order to be saved, as the old Catholic catechism says. The Buddhist nun Thubten Chodron, who grew up near Los Angeles and graduated from UCLA before her conversion, puts it this SPRING 2008 · 109</page><page sequence="3">WHAT BUDDHISTS AND CHRISTIANS ARE TEACHING EACH OTHER ABOUT GOD way: "If 'God' is used to refer to a creator, then Buddhists have a differ ing view. From a Buddhist viewpoint, there was no beginning." Her rea soning is typical of Buddhists: "Surely there is no reason to create suffering or even create beings who have the potential to degenerate from perfection into suffering." But if by "God," she continues, you refer to one "who has infinite love and wisdom and who is free of vengeance and partiality, then yes, Buddhists accept this. Love, wisdom, patience, and impartiality are quali ties of all the Buddhas." But "all the Buddhas" isn't the same as God the Father, not to men tion the Trinity. So the two traditions still seem to be a long way from bridging their differences. Are there more accommodating statements from other Buddhists? There are. In his book Living Buddha, Living Christ, Thich Nhat Hanh tells us that the love and devotion to the Buddha "became so great that the idea of Dharmakaya changed from the body of teaching to the glorious, eternal Buddha." He then refers to Paul Tillich's famous description of God as the "ground of being" and says that the "Buddha is also sometimes described as the ground of being." Later he enlists Thomas Merton to his side. Merton, he says, passed beyond the need of "simple and primitive images" of God as his faith and experience matured. It is clear that Nhat Hanh has in mind the ordinary Christian's anthropomorphic notion of a Heavenly Father who orders events in the world and answers prayers from on high. Nhat Hanh believes that this elementary notion of God, good for beginners, can cost a person his (or her) faith when his image of God no longer squares with the events of his life. Nhat Hanh says, "If you stick to an idea or an image of God and if you do not touch the reality of God [as did Merton], one day you will be plunged into doubt." "Touch the reality of God": What does that mean to a modern Bud dhist? Surya Das, a Jewish-born, Bar Mitzvahed convert to Buddhism who grew up on Long Island as Jeffrey Miller and whose mother refers to him as the Deli Lama, sticks to the language of experience. For him the ultimate reality, experienced in deep meditative states, is best described as a "ground luminosity...endowed with the heart of uncondi tional compassion and love." 110 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="4">STAFFORD BETTY Jack Kornfield, who grew up in a "scientific and intellectual house hold" and graduated from Dartmouth before converting to Buddhism, describes it as "the clear light, the pure clear light, from which everything in the universe comes, to which everything in the universe returns.... Trust it, merge with it. It is your own true nature, it is home." And Nhat Hanh calls it simply "the Universe." You will note that there is an intentional vagueness about this "God," and you might want nothing to do with it. But this vagueness is attractive to many Christians. It is the very ingredient that is quietly, almost stealthily influencing much Christian theology. It might very well be the future of Christian theology. Here is why. Prayerful Christian intellectuals who allow themselves to "think out side the box," as Christianity's best seminaries insist they do, gradually realize that they know very little about who or what God is. They real ize, as Thomas Aquinas did seven hundred years ago, that all talk about God is based on analogy and is far from literal. For example, God is not a literal Father, but possesses characteristics, mysterious to us, that are "sort of fatherly." Nowadays those theologians thinking outside the box are just as likely to think of God as sort of motherly. As Julian of Norwich taught us 700 years ago, it is even possible to think of Jesus as "our Mother." And Harvard's Diana Eck, along with many other feminist Christian theologians, tells us that she thinks of the Holy Spirit as femi nine. Where does this metaphor-making stop? This is where Buddhists can be helpful. It stops with experience, they tell us. The deeper you go into prayer and meditation, the less con fidence you have in words. The only thing you know for sure is that there is a great Reality that you can know and even merge with. The Catholic monk Thomas Keating, who founded the Christian Centering Prayer movement, agrees: "We are going beyond the sacred word into union with that to which it points—the Ultimate Mysteiy, the Presence of God beyond any conception that we can form of Him." In the sixth century Dionysius the Areopagite emphasized the superiority of mystical knowledge—which does not rely on words or reason—over a purely rational knowledge of God. Eight hundred years later the anonymous author of The Cloud of Unknowing built on Dionysius' via negativa and helped situate it in the Catholic Church's arsenal of accepted spiritual SPRING 2008 · 111</page><page sequence="5">WHAT BUDDHISTS AND CHRISTIANS ARE TEACHING EACH OTHER ABOUT GOD practices, where it has remained ever since. Late in life the prominent Protestant theologian John Hick had an experience that convinced him of the mystic's superior position. For him all words about God, however sublime, fall hopelessly short of their mark. Now Hick refers to God simply as "the Transcendent." And that's exactly the way it should be, his Buddhist brothers and sisters tell him. There is another reason that this Buddhist-style blurring of God's out line can be helpful. It is that a too precisely defined theology can get you into trouble with your faith. I see this happening all the time when Chris tians (or would-be Christians) fault God for the evil in the world. If you think of God as both all-good and all-powerful, the presence of horrific evil, such as you find all round you, seems inconsistent with God—espe cially when you yourself are living through what you consider wholly undeserved torment. But the theological problem of evil does not exist for the Buddhist. Evil exists aplenty, to be sure; but not the specifically Wes tern Problem of Evil, which points out a glaring inconsistency between God's precisely defined nature and a world gone berserk. Yes, there is the time-honored Free Will Defense which serves very well for many Chris tians as a solution to the problem. But for others the solution does not work. And that failure can lead to atheism, hopelessness, and a sense that all life is absurd, as existentialists since Sartre have been trying to tell us. Buddhists do not see this intentional blurring of a too precisely con ceptualized Reality as a loss, but a distinct gain. First, such blurring more honestly reflects our limited knowledge of the Ultimate. Second, it saves us from having to defend, both to others and ourselves, a formula that often seems out of whack with our own experience. Third, it encourages in us a more experiential approach to knowing God; it forces us to go deeper, to become more mystical. For some, Christians and Buddhists alike, it is enough to know that the Mysterious Boundless Being, however named, is a joyous, compas sionate, loving, and powerful Reality that can be known intimately in the private sanctuary of their own hearts. Now let us reverse course. What do Buddhists stand to gain from the way Christians think and speak about God? Let me state at the outset that I, though not a Buddhist practitioner, have the deepest respect for Buddhism and, in the spirit of Vatican II, 112 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="6">STAFFORD BETTY see it as an alternate path to spiritual transformation, not an inferior one. But, like eveiy other religion, it could evolve into something even better than it is. As I see it, Buddhism's greatest weakness is its reluctance to take the God concept seriously. Buddhists, of course, like to avoid talking about God. A personal God such as Christians, Jews, and Muslims worship is unappealing to Buddhists. Most Western Buddhists are rugged individual ists, as was the Buddha himself. Even if God existed, they say, He would have no part to play in the reconstruction and sanctification of human character—and what else is important? The only aids needed for this are human: the Buddha's example, his teachings, and the community of his followers, especially his monks. These "Three Jewels" or "Refuges" were the only helps the Buddha held out to his disciples 2,500 years ago, and they are usually felt to be sufficient for guiding contemporary seekers, especially Western seekers, to enlightenment today as well. Even the celestial Buddhas and Bodhisattvas that most Mahayana and Tibetan sects honor and even worship are not necessaiy for Buddhist salvation. And these Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are not quite God, even though they somewhat close the gap between Western and Buddhist conceptions of Ultimate Reality. Thich Nhat Hanh tells the stoiy of a conversation he once had with a "Protestant minister" following dinner. The Christian asked Nhat Hanh if he was grateful for the food he ate, and the monk answered yes. Then the minister continued: "If you are really grateful, how can you not believe in God? God has created everything we enjoy, including the food we eat." Nhat Hanh did not know what to say, but he was certain he was very grateful for all his blessings. "We feel grateful throughout the meal and throughout the day," he explained, "and we express this by being fully aware of the food and living every moment deeply. This is how I try to express my gratitude to all of life." He then went on to explain that before every meal a Buddhist monk or nun "recites the Five Contemplations: 'This food is the gift of the whole universe—the earth, the sky, and much hard work'." I have gone into this exchange at such length because it ideally shows the difference on the question of God between the Christian and the Buddhist. Whereas the Buddhist feels gratitude to "all of life" and SPRING 2008 · 113</page><page sequence="7">WHAT BUDDHISTS AND CHRISTIANS ARE TEACHING EACH OTHER ABOUT GOD even to "the whole universe," the Christian feels gratitude to God. Is one approach better than the other? From the Christian's standpoint, gratitude does not have its full meaning outside a personal relationship. How can one feel gratitude to a thing or a process or even a giant gestalt like a universe? One feels grati tude in the fullest sense to another person who has done one some good and intended the good. Gratitude is relational. Is it really possible to feel gratitude toward the universe in the same way that one feels gratitude toward a personal being like the traditional theist's God? Most Christians wouldn't think so. This difficulty points up what most Christians see as the deficiency in Buddhism. In place of an ultimate reality that is personal and relational is what Thubten Chodron calls a "principle of love and compassion." Lama Surya Das, as we saw above, refers to it as the "Ground Luminosity." Jack Kornfield describes it as "a goodness of heart, strength, and wholeness that is our birthright...our original nature, or Buddha nature." What is striking about each of these descriptions—and they are typical of modern, especially Western Buddhism—is their impersonality. Many Christians have grown somewhat comfortable with impersonal ways of speaking of God. Paul Tillich's "Ground of Being" was, after all, a watershed event in the history of Protestant Christian theology. But Buddhists are more relentless in their pursuit of the impersonal than Tillich was. It began with the Buddha himself. Not only did he find no evidence of a personal God. He found no evidence of personhood anywhere, not even in humans. His "no soul" doctrine, which he defends ingeniously even as he holds to a belief in rebirth, is interwoven into Buddhism's entire history. Buddhists think that the belief that we are persons with souls is the great illusion that is at the heart of all our problems. We are not eternal souls that anchor our being and make all our experiences ours, but mindstreams that must be destroyed if ever we are to realize Nirvana. "The cessation of continuity and becoming" is the way that one of the Buddha's direct disciples describes the goal. Or as the Sri Lankan Buddhist monk Walpola Rahula puts it: The "will to be, to exist, to re-exist, to become more and more, to grow more and more, to accumulate more and more"—that is the central problem of humanity that brings us all our misery. 114 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="8">STAFFORD BETTY Buddhism's firm commitment to transcending personhood shows itself in its view of ultimate beatitude. Where the Christian sees a continuing personhood in a communion of fellow saints under a per sonal God, the Buddhist sees an extinction of personhood in an inde scribable state approximated by nothing in human experience. This is not to say that Buddhists believe that Nirvana is extinction pure and sim ple, as in modern materialism; it is to say that Nirvana is the utter eclipse of the individual person as we know him or her. The Tibetan Book of the Dead puts it this way: if we are truly enlightened, we will recog nize, shortly after our death, a "Boundless Luminosity" as our basic nat ure and surrender our individuality in order to merge into it. If we do this, we will have achieved "the cessation of continuity and becoming" and put an end to suffering for all time. Buddhists are sensitive to the charge that their religion is pessimis tic. They reply that the Buddha showed them the way out of samsara, the near endless round of rebirth and redeath with all its suffering and pain, and that any religion that promises eternal deliverance is hardly pessimistic. They have a point. But there is another way to look at the matter. Christianity promises not only an end to suffering and pain, but the continuation of individuals—billions of them. What would you rather have? A self-canceling fusion with a blissful eternal reality, or your bliss alongside the bliss of countless others in a perfect society where all have learned to submerge their self-interest—not their selves—for the good and happiness of all? Today very few Buddhists in traditionally Buddhist countries pursue Nirvana. Most hope for and work toward a better life next time round. The noblest usually yearn to become Bodhisattvas. The Dalai Lama, regarded by Tibetan Buddhists as the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, expresses this ideal in the following poem: "For as long as space endures, / And for as long as living beings remain, / Until then may I, too, abide / To dispel the miseiy of the world." It is possible that this profoundly noble ideal is fueled in part by the sheer strangeness of the alternative, Nirvana—an experience without a self to experience it. Buddhism has shown over and over the power to make saints, even Buddhist masters, of ex-Jews and ex-Christians. Contemporary Buddhist literature is as powerful and eloquent as any spiritual literature being written today. It is clear to me that Buddhism is responding to a need SPRING 2008 · 115</page><page sequence="9">WHAT BUDDHISTS AND CHRISTIANS ARE TEACHING EACH OTHER ABOUT GOD that many sensitive Westerners feel keenly: a way of salvation that does not depend on an anachronistic deity that you have to flatter and abase yourself in front of in order to join the club. Above we looked at the way that Buddhism helps Christianity move beyond this caricature of God so prevalent in our country today. Here a chastened Christianity returns the favor: It shows how Buddhism might reassess the place of the person in the ultimate scheme of things. The modern Christian mystic Bede Griffiths wrote: "In eternity the many are contained in the One without losing their individuality. Each human being is a focus of the divine Light which shines through all equally, but each receives it according to its capacity." Persons do not need to have their personhood extinguished in order to become perfected; they need to have it transformed. Once transformed, it will then be worth saving—especially if the process of transformation and growth, what theologian John Hick calls soul-building, continues through eternity. In a similar vein Buddhists might reconsider the nature of ultimate reality. If we as persons are worth saving, then isn't it possible the ulti mate reality itself is personal? Would it not make sense for this personal God to create personal beings because He (She) is a personal being Him/ Herself and personal beings are the best sort of thing He/She can create? If Buddhists can be accused of being pessimistic, it is because they have given up on the perfectibility of persons. For Buddhists, persons are intrinsically and fatally selfish. Christians think otherwise, and they point to a Mother Teresa or even a Dalai Lama to prove their point. And if human persons are approaching perfection in front of our very eyes, then why should it be difficult to think that the apotheosis of perfection, God, is the supreme person? Buddhists and Christians have much to teach each other. What I have observed is that contemporary Buddhists are helping Christians let go of their too precisely defined view of God, while Christians are help ing Buddhists inject personhood into the Infinite. Each tradition is tip toeing toward the other. I believe that this approach is exciting and constructive. CROSSCURRENTS</page></plain_text>
