         <p>We are living today in the great age of narrative. I do not mean that we are living in the age
    of great narrative; it is far from certain that W. G. Sebald's <italic>Austerlitz</italic>
    is aesthetically superior to Dante's <italic>Inferno</italic> or that Milan Kundera's
     <italic>Ignorance</italic>, stunning as it is, makes for a better <italic>nostos</italic> than
    the <italic>Odyssey</italic>. I mean simply that we Westerners are more obsessed with
    stories—good, bad, and indifferent—than ever before. We no longer have the slightest
    time for lyric poetry but instead consume infinite quantities of novels and films and television
     shows,2 and the programs we like most are those that
    feature transformation, metamorphosis, <italic>Bildung</italic>, whether spiritual growth or
    just physical improvement. (We are living, one could also say, in the age of the makeover.) In
    the world of philosophy it has become an article of faith that selfhood must be understood
     narratively,3 and in some quarters it is even believed
    that the nature of <italic>any</italic> given entity is nothing more nor less than the history
    of that entity. In literary criticism, the great motto is “always historicize.” (Why
    not “always philosophize”? Philosophers, it seems, are less imperialist—or at
    least more polite—in their dealings with other disciplines.) Even the art world has become
    invaded by the spirit of narrativity, with a creeping tendency toward kinetic works. We are
    deeply impatient with the static. If it doesn't move, we refuse to look at it.</p>
         <p>Yet out there in the world, nothing has changed. It is not that atemporal phenomena—the
    beauty of a landscape, say, or of an individual's personality—have suddenly become
    less valuable, in real terms. It is just that we are paying less and less attention to them, and
    that it is more and more difficult, accordingly, to create a space for their perception. The
    question is, how is this to be done? How can we rescue nonnarrative phenomena from the tsunami
    of diachronic thinking that threatens to sweep everything away with it? How, in an age obsessed
    with change, can we enable people to see what sits quietly in front of them?</p>

               <p>Interest in popular song, of course, has remained robust, but the same cannot be said for
      written forms of poetry. Nor is the decline of the latter the result, as one sometimes hears,
      of a widespread postmodern skepticism about selfhood. On the contrary, the general reader
      today, having been blessedly spared the ravages of postmodernism, is more obsessed with
      selfhood than ever before. The clearest evidence of this is the barrage of memoirs to which we
      have been subjected in recent years (not to mention biographical documentaries, fictional life
      stories, and the usual steady stream of strong protagonists). We are still deeply fascinated
      by selves, but for some reason we have become convinced that the important questions about
      them are <italic>historical</italic>: where they came from, what that did to them, how they
      overcame it. That is why poetry and painting are, for now at least, losing the war against
      narrative forms.</p>

         <title>1. “Why Can't There Be a Movie Simply about Flowers?”</title>
         <p>In Charlie Kaufman's <italic>Adaptation</italic> (2002), the central character, also
    called Charlie Kaufman, attempts to turn Susan Orlean's book <italic>The Orchid
     Thief</italic> into a full-length feature film. (Although a clean separation is fiendishly hard
    to make, I shall refer to the screenwriter as Kaufman and to his fictional alter ego as Charlie;
    I shall also distinguish between Susan, the character in <italic>Adaptation</italic>, and
    Orlean, author of <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic>. Delightfully, Susan and Orlean have even
    written two distinct books: while the fictional <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic> closes on the
    phrase “fantastic and fleeting and out of reach,” the real-world <italic>The Orchid
     Thief</italic> includes the phrase on page 41, a full 241 pages before the very different
     ending.)4 Eschewing the standard devices of Hollywood
    narrative, Charlie (Nicolas Cage, who also plays Charlie's twin brother, Donald) sets out
    to make a film that would capture nothing more or less than the magic of orchids, without,
    needless to say, degenerating into Warholesque tedium. “Why,” he asks,
    “can't there be a movie simply about flowers?”</p>
         <p>That is the question the film raises explicitly, through its main character. But
    Charlie's question drags behind it another question, <italic>Kaufman's</italic>
    question, no longer explicit but equally inescapable. Why would anyone <italic>want</italic> to
    make a movie simply about flowers? Why on earth would Columbia Studios so much as dream that the
    right thing to do with a (nonfiction) book about orchids is to turn it into a major motion
    picture? Why does Charlie (or Kaufman, for that matter) accept the challenge, rather than
    laughing at its patent absurdity? The answer is, I think, what I mentioned a little earlier: our
    culture is obsessed with narrative. No one today would look at paintings of orchids, let alone
    read sonnets about them, and not many would even watch a documentary about orchids and their
    hunters. (It is a measure of just how deeply the obsession runs that many viewers sit through
    the entirety of <italic>Adaptation</italic> without the question ever occurring to them; they
    focus on Charlie's failure, as though the idea of transforming <italic>The Orchid
     Thief</italic> into a feature-length Hollywood film were a perfectly reasonable one.) Charlie
    is forced to make a movie because movies are what we are willing to pay attention
    to—movies, not poems, let alone flowers themselves. The cost, however, is the introduction
    of narrative into a domain where none belongs.5</p>

               <p>The phrase is also altered slightly. What was, in <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic>, a
      statement about Laroche's life—“<italic>his</italic> life seemed to be filled
      with things that were just like the ghost orchid—wonderful to imagine and easy to fall
      in love with but a little fantastic and fleeting and out of reach” (Susan Orlean,
       <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic> [New York, 1998], p. 41; my emphasis; hereafter abbreviated
       <italic>OT</italic>)—becomes, in <italic>Adaptation</italic>, a statement about life in
      general, the initial possessive adjective quietly removed. (The book we see Charlie reading is
      this book, not the original <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic>; Kaufman clearly had a prop
      specially made, superficially resembling Orlean's text but differing in that respect.)
      For the record, the final sentence of the <italic>real</italic> book is the rather bathetic
      “first we turned to the right but saw only more cypress and palm and saw grass, so we
      turned to the left, and there, far down the diagonal of the levee, we could see the gleam of a
      car fender, and we followed it like a beacon all the way to the road”

         <title>2. Stories about Flowers</title>
         <p>Could there be a movie that is simply about flowers? Perhaps there could be a movie about
     <italic>a</italic> flower (or at least about a single patch of flowers), depicting the story of
    its life. But then again, what is the story of a flower? What, to paraphrase Charlie, is a
    flower's “arc”?6 If the phrase makes any
    sense at all in the present context, it applies to the steady rhythm of anthic life:7 seed to bloom, bloom to seed; open at dawn, closed at dusk; an
    arc of endless simplicity, and the very image, in fact, with which <italic>Adaptation</italic>
    concludes. For what we see, after Charlie drives away, is a cluster of daisies on the median of
    the highway. We watch them in time-lapse as they open and close, open and close, to the cheery
    strains of “Happy Together,” while the human world (in the form of speeding cars)
    races on behind them in a steady blur (fig. 1).8</p>

         <p>The juxtaposition of plant and human domains merely serves, however, to throw into starker
    relief the distinction between the two. For flowers and people occupy radically divergent
    chronologies. Anthic time is at once too slow and too fast: so slow that it requires time-lapse
    photography to capture it, so fast that it fails to engage the quasi-empathetic response we are
    able to grant longer-lived entities like redwoods. (Caring deeply about an individual daisy is
    about as difficult as caring deeply about a mayfly.) The time of colonies and species is
    cyclical, not linear—no “arc” here, properly speaking, only a loop—and
    the time of individual blooms is too brief, too gradual, too predictable. One cannot tell the
    story of a flower because stories belong to human time, and flowers have their being outside of
    that time.9</p>

               <p>It should be noted from the outset that the problem is not one of adaptation per se. Thomas
      Leitch takes the film to be “showing that anything like a faithful adaptation of
      Orlean's book, and by extension of any literary text, is a contradiction in terms”
      (Thomas M. Leitch, <italic>Film Adaptation and Its Discontents: From “Gone with the
       Wind” to “The Passion of the Christ”</italic> [Baltimore, Md., 2007], p.
      112). But first of all, Orlean's book is not a literary text (in the modern definition of
      the word), since it is a prose work of nonfiction. And, second, nothing said or implied by
       <italic>Adaptation</italic> suggests that the problem extends beyond books about flowers (or
      other nonnarrative phenomena). The question is not how to adapt books for the screen; it is
      how to adapt flowers to a narrative.</p>

               <p>David L. Smith sees this as the core of <italic>Adaptation</italic>. Flowers have no

      Implicit Soul of Charlie Kaufman's <italic>Adaptation</italic>,” <italic>Philosophy
       and Literature</italic> 30 [Oct. 2006]: 426). I very much share this sense of Kaufman's
      starting point. I depart, however, when it comes to the telos. Smith takes seriously (see p.
      431) the idea that flowers can have an arc (that of macroevolution), an idea that I see as
      heavily ironized by the movie. And he sees <italic>Adaptation</italic> as ultimately serving
      “to uphold and sustain competing truths,” rather than to fulfill the initial
      promise of making flowers available to us moderns (p. 433). On the notion of human time, see

         <title>3. Stories around Flowers</title>
         <p>It is impossible, then, to tell the story of a flower. What is more, however excited Charlie
    may be at one point by the idea—“that's it, that's what I need to do: tie
    all of history together!”—it is equally impossible to tell the story of flowers in
    general (which is to say, tell the entire story of evolution). For as the comedy of the
    situation immediately makes clear, there is no such thing as the story of everything; a story
    about everything is a story about nothing. Perhaps, though (and this is the third strategy
    implicitly proposed by <italic>Adaptation</italic>)10 we
    could tell a story <italic>around</italic> flowers. Not a story <italic>of</italic> flowers, but
    a story <italic>involving</italic> flowers, a story that takes flowers as its pretext. A story,
    say, about intrepid hunters like August Margary, who “survived toothache, rheumatism,
    pleurisy, and dysentery while sailing the Yangtze only to be murdered when he completed his
    mission and traveled beyond Bhamo” (<italic>OT</italic>, p. 55). The risk here, however,
    is that we either write about <italic>several</italic> orchid hunters, ending up with a series
    of vignettes rather than a coherent narrative, or write about just one and run out of things to
    say. If <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic> proves nothing else, it surely proves this. As Ted
    Conover aptly notes in the <italic>New York Times</italic> review that Charlie quotes so
    despairingly, “there's not … nearly enough of [Laroche] to fill a book, so
    Orlean … digresses in long passages… . No narrative really unites these
     passages.”11</p>
         <p>Let me just say, for the record, that this is a vast understatement. Orlean goes into
    astonishing depth on other orchid fanciers like Martin Motes, Savilla Quick, and Bob Fuchs; and
    not only does she give us more detail than we could ever need about Fuchs, but she goes on to
    inform us about his father, Freddie, an orchid hunter, his grandfather, Fred, explorer of the
    swamp, and even his <italic>great</italic>-grandfather, Charles, who moved to Florida and tried
    to become a farmer before going back to baking. (Finally, after a full ten pages of filler, she
    returns to the point of the whole digression: a robbery at Fuchs's nursery.) Not content
    with mentioning one Lee Moore, a man on trial for plant smuggling, she tells us about his
    childhood, his father, his wife, Chady, the various irrelevant things he and his wife have to
    say, the list of flowers he has discovered, the newsletter he used to produce, a near-death
    experience he has had, and his sideline as an antiquities thief. When at last Orlean asks him if
    he happens to know John Laroche, “Lee squinted and rubbed his chin. ‘Don't
    think I know the fellow,’ he said” (<italic>OT</italic>, p. 199).12 Orlean is already flailing for the right story to tell. How is Charlie
    expected to do any better?</p>

         <title>4. Fictions around Flowers</title>
         <p>Perhaps he could resort to a fourth solution: <italic>invent</italic> a story around flowers.
    Make up a drug scheme involving their use as narcotics. Concoct a love intrigue involving their
    role as intermediary. Hatch a crime scenario involving murder committed in their name. Devise a
    friendship plot involving characters who grow, thanks to flowers, to understand each other. This
    approach has the advantage of offering enough material for a film while preserving thematic
    unity, and it is, of course, exactly what we see toward the end of <italic>Adaptation</italic>.
    But it is also exactly what Charlie has set out to avoid.</p>
         <p>Here is Charlie talking to Valerie Thomas (Tilda Swinton) in the very first scene of the
    movie: <speech>
               <speaker>C<sc>harlie</sc>:</speaker>
               <p>I'd want to let the movie <italic>exist</italic>, rather than be artificially
      plot-driven… . I just don't want to ruin it by making it a Hollywood thing, you
      know. Like an orchid heist movie, or something… . Or, you know, changing the orchids
      into poppies and turning it into a movie about drug-running… . Why can't there be
      a movie simply about flowers?</p>

               <p>OK, but … I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases. You know? Or
      characters, you know, learning profound life lessons. Or growing, or coming to like each
      other, or overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. You know? I mean, the book isn't
      like that, and life isn't like that.13</p>
            </speech> By the end, however, every last element Charlie has sworn not to include has found its
    way—more or less in order, indeed—into the film: drugs (the orchids' secret
    chemical), sex (Orlean and Laroche), guns (Laroche in the swamp), car chases (Donald's
    death), characters learning profound life lessons (“who you are is what you love, not what
    loves you”), characters growing (Charlie) and coming to like each other (Charlie and
    Donald in the swamp), characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end (Charlie writing his
    screenplay). There is even a deus ex machina, that device explicitly banned by Robert McKee
    (Brian Cox), in the form of an alligator, and of course generous heapings of voice-over. Charlie
    has become what he hated, and the film has, by his own standards, failed completely.14</p>

               <p>Hey, let's not get off the subject. This isn't a pissing contest. The point is,
      what's so wonderful is that every one of these flowers has a specific relationship with
      the insect that pollinates it. There's a certain orchid [that] looks exactly like a
      certain insect, so the—insect is drawn to this flower. Its double. Its—soul mate.
      And wants nothing more than to make love with it. And after the insect flies off, it spots
      another soul mate flower and makes love to <italic>it</italic>, thus pollinating it. And
      neither the flower nor the insect will ever understand the significance of their lovemaking.
      How could they know that because of their little dance, the world lives? But it does! By
      simply doing what they're designed to do, something large and magnificent happens. In
      this sense, they show us how to live, how the only barometer you have is your heart. How when
      you spot your flower, you can't let anything get in your way.</p>
            </speech> “In this sense, they show us how to live”: the moral of the story is to be
    yourself, to find the one thing that you are designed to do, to pursue your passion, safe in the
    (almost Adam Smithian) knowledge that it will make the world a better place. This sounds like a
    beautiful idea, made even more beautiful by being connected to the deepest secrets of the
    physical world—it is as though romantic love were a law of nature, on a par with gravity
    and the conservation of energy—and by the luscious images of bees and ophrys orchids,
    often in extreme close-up and shallow focus, set to soft, rising strings. Laroche is drawing on
    his extensive knowledge of the anthic realm to tell us something vitally important about the
    human condition, indeed something existentially important, in that it can and should serve as a
    guide to our behavior. And so we have the glimmerings of a fifth solution: compensate for the
    dearth of story by a series of impressions inspired by flowers, a bouquet of flower-shaped
    thoughts, a set of lessons the plant world has to teach us about what human life is or could be.
    (This, surely, is Orlean's own strategy; for every aspect of flowers, she seems to feel,
    there is an analogous point to be made about human life.)</p>

         </fig-group>
         <p>But when we look more closely, we find that there are serious problems with the apparent
    lesson ostensibly taught by flowers. First of all, there is something unintentionally comical in
    the claim that the bee “spots another soul mate flower”: the very definition of soul
    mate includes the nonnegotiable notion of singularity. There can only be <italic>one</italic>
    soul mate; when you have found your “other half”—“when you spot your
    flower”—it makes no sense to go on searching (let alone to “make love
    to” <italic>other</italic> “soul mates”).15 And if each bee does not have a specific soul mate, then this part of nature cannot
    imply that each of us has a specific vocation; the entire analogy falls apart.16</p>
         <p>In addition, there is every indication that it is not Laroche speaking at all.17 It is already possible to detect a change in tone, I think,
    just from reading the text of the scene: beginning with “there's a certain orchid
    … .,” Laroche suddenly shifts into a higher register, refined, thoughtful, even
    lyrical. Instead of “evolution guy” and “pissing contest,” we see
    “the significance of their lovemaking” and “the only barometer you
    have.” But it is clearer still on film, since the sound quality changes dramatically
    (clearly this part was recorded in a studio, without the ambient noise of the set). What is
    more, we no longer see Laroche's face.18 The strong
    suggestion here is that Susan is projecting the ideas onto Laroche and that the ideas themselves
    are deeply confused. Susan wants nature to have secrets and wants humankind to have exceptional
    individuals—oracles, seers—capable of delivering them. But Kaufman cannot bring
    himself to feel the same way.</p>
         <fn-group>

               <label>15. </label>
               <p>Part of the irony, of course, is that Laroche himself does not have a “soul
      mate” vocation, any more than Susan does (or Orlean for that matter: after writing about
      orchid hunters, she went on to expatiate about dog shows and origami). Instead, his modus
      operandi is to fall “madly in love” with something, only to drop it cold. Here is
      Orlean on Laroche's turtles, fossils, lapidary, mirrors, and fish: “and then he
      could think of nothing <italic>but</italic> turtles and then decided that his life wasn't
      worth living unless he could collect one of every single turtle species known to
      mankind… . Then, out of the blue, he fell out of love with turtles and fell madly in
      love with Ice Age fossils. He collected them, sold them, declared that he lived for them, then
      abandoned them for something else—lapidary I think—then he abandoned lapidary and
      became obsessed with collecting and resilvering old mirrors… . Years ago, between his
      Ice Age fossils and his old mirrors, he went through a tropical-fish phase. At its peak, he
      had more than sixty fish tanks in his house and went skin-diving regularly to collect fish.
      Then the end came. He didn't gradually lose interest: he renounced fish and vowed he
      would never again collect them and, for that matter, he would never set foot in the ocean
      again. That was seventeen years ago. He has lived his whole life only a couple of feet west of
      the Atlantic, but he has not dipped a toe in it since then” (<italic>OT</italic>, p. 4).
      Much of this is reprised in <italic>Adaptation</italic>, supplemented by the brilliant Kaufman
      coinage, “that's how much fuck fish.”</p>

         <title>6. A Story about a Story</title>
         <p>We are left with a rather despairing option: turn the five failed solutions themselves into a
    narrative. Tell <italic>the story of the impossibility of telling a story about
    flowers</italic>. Recount the tale of a screenwriter pounding away at the hard rock face of
    adaptation and being repeatedly defeated. Perhaps even give this screenwriter an

    his movie by solving the psychological problem of his life. Call him, why not? by one's own
    name…</p>
         <p>Is this a little narcissistic?19 Yes, but the beauty of
    it is that narcissism is the only strategy appropriate to the context. To be sure,
    Kaufman's movie is really a movie about Kaufman, not Orlean; but then, Orlean's book
    was really a book about Orlean, not Laroche. <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic> is not about
    flowers, or Laroche, or even orchid hunting more generally; it is, instead, about the ability,
    so yearned for by Orlean, “to care about something passionately.”20 So, too, Charlie projects his own frustrated desire—in his case, for
    reciprocated attraction, for release from the prison of solipsism—onto the subject matter.
    (Immediately after an imagined Susan advises him to “find that one thing that you care
    passionately about and then write about that,” the film cuts to Charlie saying into his
    voice recorder “we see Susan Orlean, delicate, haunted by loneliness, fragile,
     beautiful.”)21 And so, too,
     <italic>Kaufman</italic> projects onto it <italic>his</italic> own desire, this time for a
    Hollywood film that would just be about flowers. In short, paradoxically, Kaufman captures the
    spirit of <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic> precisely by being unfaithful to it.</p>

               <p>I wanted to keep coming back to Florida until I could see one. The reason was not that I
      love orchids. I don't even especially <italic>like</italic> orchids. What I wanted was to
      see this thing that people were drawn to in such a singular and powerful way. Everyone I was
      meeting connected to the orchid poaching had circled their lives around some great
      desire—Laroche had his crazy inspirations and orchid lovers had their intense devotion
      to their flowers and the Seminoles had their burning dedication to their history and
      culture—a desire that then answered questions for them about how to spend their time and
      their money and who their friends would be and where they would travel and what they did when
      they got there. It was religion. I wanted to want something as much as people wanted these
      plants, but it isn't part of my constitution. I think people my age are embarrassed by
      too much enthusiasm and believe that too much passion about anything is naive. I suppose I do
      have one unembarrassing passion—I want to know what it feels like to care about
      something passionately. [<italic>OT</italic>, pp. 40–41]</p>

         <title>7. Narrative Destroyed</title>
         <p>The story does not end there, however. It might seem as though Kaufman has succeeded in
    adapting <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic> in a perversely appropriate manner—indeed far
    more faithfully, in a sense, than if he had simply rewritten its events for the screen—but
    failed at the much more important task of making a movie about flowers. (Let's be honest:
     <italic>Adaptation</italic> is about as much about flowers as <italic>Flowers for
     Algernon</italic> is about flowers.)22 Recall, however,
    that <italic>Adaptation</italic> closes with a time-lapse sequence of daisies on a meridian, an
    astonishingly powerful sequence, with rhythms borrowed (appropriately enough) from the Fibonacci
     series23 and set to music that ends in a lush, ethereal
    harmony. What if this sequence were not just the finale but also the telos of the movie?24 What if the entire film were simply building up to the
    daisies on the meridian, indeed making them possible, turning them for the first time into
    something that can be noticed? (fig. 4).25</p>

         </fig-group>
         <p>This, I want to claim, is the deep strategy of the film, the seventh and only successful
    approach, the one that finally brings about a victory for the nonnarrative (the static, the
    cyclical) over the narrative. It is, I should add, <italic>Kaufman's</italic> plan, not
    that of his character. For Charlie declares himself satisfied, and his movie finished, when he
    has worked out how to write his screenplay: “I have to go right home. I know how to end
    the script now. It ends with Kaufman driving home after his encounter with Amelia thinking he
    knows how to finish the script… . So. Kaufman drives off from his encounter with Amelia,
    filled for the first time with hope. I like this. This is good.”</p>
         <p>Charlie stops here (it is the last we see of him), and Charlie's putative movie stops
     here.26 But <italic>Adaptation</italic>, and Kaufman, do
    not. Charlie and Kaufman are, in fact, quite different: unlike Charlie, Kaufman has no twin
    brother; unlike Charlie, Kaufman is neither fat nor balding; unlike Charlie, Kaufman is not
    deeply antisocial and not crippled by neuroses (he admits to sweating under pressure, but this
    is a far cry from what we see). And unlike Charlie, for these very reasons, Kaufman <italic>does
     not write himself into his own movie</italic>.27 He
    writes, instead, a <italic>caricature</italic> of himself into his movie, complete with some
    traits borrowed from the original (the desire to adapt <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic>, the
    inability to do so),28 some traits distorted or
    exaggerated (the anxiety), and some traits simply invented from whole cloth (the weight, the
    hair loss, the brother).29 Charlie is not quite Kaufman,
    and Charlie's film is not quite the one we have been watching, either.</p>
         <p>Charlie's film stops at solution six: it becomes a film about a writer attempting to
    produce a screenplay and in a sense succeeding (although he fails to tell the story of
     <italic>The Orchid Thief</italic>, he manages at least to tell his own story). For Charlie, one
    might say, all that counts is that there be a (workable) screenplay, regardless of its theme.
    Kaufman's film, by contrast, delivers on the original promise to make a movie that would
    bring us closer to flowers. And it does so precisely by taking the detour through approaches one
    to six, by trying each one on only to discard it, by giving us an overdose of what we believed
    we wanted. Kaufman cannot simply show us flowers, right from the get-go; he must relentlessly
    rid us of our desire for more, patiently overcome our temptation to extract morals, meticulously
    ridicule our demand for stories. The opening of the movie sets the terms of the question; the
    first part cures us of our desire for flower-based wisdom, for stories around flowers, and for
    the story of flowers; and the second part, with its cascade of action, cures us by surfeit of
    our desire for narrative more generally, killing it off, as it were, along with Donald. We are
    able for the first time to see, actually see, what would have escaped our (full) attention at
    the start of the film, namely, flowers. <italic>Adaptation</italic> is, in the end, not an
    answer to the question why there can't be a movie simply about flowers.30 But it is not a mere side-stepping of the question either. It is, instead,
    a reaction to the question underneath the question, the question of why we are so obsessed with
    narrative in the first place. It is not a statement but an <italic>action</italic>, a
    philosophical therapy.31 Its value lies in what it does,
    and what it does is to make the essentially atemporal life of flowers available once again to
    human beings, via the only medium they still take seriously.</p>

      five and a half on day two, two on day three. The relative length of the last five

      kinds of botanical phemomena; if you count the petals on a daisy, for example, you will almost
      always find yourself with a Fibonacci number.) After that, the last day slows to what feels

               <p>Kaufman: “The movie's pretty accurate in its depiction of my false starts and my
      confusion, and how I just had to plug away because I was hired and because they had paid me a
      certain amount of money to proceed, and so I had to. I would have dropped it a hundred times
      if they didn't give me that advance money, but I felt [an] obligation” (Charlie

               <p>A number of critics have wanted the film to be making arguments, sending messages,
      transmitting statements about the human condition. Thus Matthew Anderson sees the film as
      “present[ing] an argument” (Anderson, <italic>“Adaptation,”</italic>
      ¶41); Zacharek claims that it “doesn't offer us a real story, just a bloated
      thesis,” the thesis being “that human beings must adapt in order to grow”
      (“A”); for Gregory Ganssle, quite the reverse, “the deeper message of the
      film is that there are limits to human adaptability” (Ganssle, “Consciousness,
      Memory, and Identity,” p. 115); and for Lucas Hildebrand, the line “you are what
      you love, not what loves you” is to be taken entirely seriously as a lesson Kaufman
      wishes us to learn; see Lucas Hildebrand, “Review,” <italic>Film
       Quarterly</italic> 58 (Fall 2004): 41. In interview after interview, however, Kaufman has
      repeatedly stressed his intention to avoid didacticism. “The movie is … not
      taking you through and teaching you something, you know, it's to have interactions
      with” (Kaufman, interview with George Stroumboulopoulos, <italic>The Hour</italic>, 12
      Oct. 2009, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

      to make any conscious point it would become banal” (Michael Sragow, “Being Charlie
      Kaufman,” <italic>Salon.com</italic>, 11 Nov. 1999,
      archive.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/11/11/kaufman/). Or yet again: “my goal when I do
      something is to have a conversation with the audience rather than to lecture them”
      (Kaufman, “Interview with Charlie Kaufman,” interview with Peter Sciretta,
       <italic>Slashfilm</italic>, 24 Oct. 2008, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"

      Messinger for these references.) The fact that Zacharek and Ganssle reach opposite
      conclusions, both based on textual evidence, is I think a strong indication that Kaufman, and
      not Zacharek, is to be believed.</p>

               <p>My approach has something in common with that of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's
       <italic>Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey</italic> (Stanford, Calif., 2004).
      I differ, however, in viewing the crucial contemporary barrier to contemplation as that of an
      obsession with narrative rather than an obsession with meaning. (The last thing I would accuse
      contemporary culture of is a surfeit of intellectualism!) To be reengaged with nonnarrative
      phenomena does not require us to surrender all interest in meanings; perceiving the beauty of
      a gesture, for example, requires understanding what it signifies. Nor does it require us to
      surrender all interest in depth, another of Gumbrecht's targets; on the contrary, the
      beauty of other human beings <italic>is</italic> their depth, the depth of that invisible
      perspective which emerges in their aesthetic and everyday style. Even scientific
      knowledge—such as the delightful fact, in <italic>Adaptation</italic>, about
      Darwin's moth—can be truly enchanting, an enrichment rather than a desiccation of
      experience. We may well wish to save all these charming babies from going out with the
      “meaning” bathwater. What is more, the contemplation of orchids need, on my
      account, have nothing mystical about it (it would certainly not need to involve a perception
      of “Being”) and need not be transitory in the manner of epiphanies (orchid-lovers
      can happily stare at bromeliads all day). Finally, I hope to have given a substantive account
      of the role that the non-“presence” elements play in the fictional work; as I see
      it, these elements are absolutely necessary for making the flowers available in the first
      place.</p>

         <title>8. The Triumph of Still Life</title>
         <p>Can this really be right? Consider, again, the Hollywoodized portion of the film, that
    thirty-minute sequence that recycles every last trope Charlie has sworn to avoid.32 Why should we not consider this a sellout, an abject
    capitulation to the imperious demand for narrative?33
    After all, even the calmer sequence that concludes the film, following the death of Donald,
    could be seen as part of the same general trend. To be sure, the tone changes here—gone is
    the high drama, gone the clichéd action-movie music—but Charlie's
    rapprochement with Amelia (Cara Seymour), while less absurd than the guns and drugs and
    alligators, surely still falls under the general rubric of characters “coming to like each
    other.” And the very fact that Charlie finds a way to complete his screenplay means that
    the movie is, however one looks at it, the story of a man “overcoming obstacles to succeed
    in the end.” Has Kaufman not given us, then, exactly what Charlie swore to withhold?</p>
         <p>We may wish to respond by saying that Kaufman merely offers us these scenes ironically, as a
    satire on Hollywood conventions. Yet this defense exposes Kaufman to a second danger, the danger
    of sweeping everything away, deep questions and heartfelt responses included, with the
    undiscriminating broom of irony. It is perhaps unsurprising, albeit unfortunate, that one of the
    movie's earliest reviewers complained that “<italic>Adaptation</italic> is a movie
    that eats itself whole and leaves the audience with nothing” (“A”);34 the ironic tone of the finale risks casting its echoes over
    the earlier parts of the film, making the entire thing seem like an exercise in sheer
    negativity, a wholesale rejection of everything.35 So here
    is the objection: should we not say that in spite of Kaufman's best efforts he has managed
    only to make yet another Hollywood film, one whose self-irony not only fails to save it—no
    one ceases being a sellout or a flop merely by acknowledging his or her shortcomings—but
    risks, like a universal solvent, dissolving everything that might otherwise have been of
    interest?</p>
         <p>The answer, in fact, is no. First, the film has done us the immense favor of breaking down a
    thorny question (can there be a movie that is just about flowers?) into its component parts (can
    one tell the story of a flower? the story of all flowers? and so on). Second, it does us the
    equally large favor of taking us through each of them in order to rid us of our temptation to
    embrace any particular one. The thirty minutes of melodrama should be understood not as a
    crowd-pleasing gesture to which Kaufman reluctantly and guiltily succumbs but rather as a
    deliberately chosen strategy whose function is, quite the contrary, to cure us of our insatiable
    appetite for narrative, not by starving it but by satisfying it to excess. And this, third, does
    us the immeasurable favor of bringing flowers before our suddenly rapt attention, of clearing a
    space for flowers to fill.</p>
         <p>Neither—to return to the earlier objection—has Kaufman quite yielded to the
    narrativity brigades by agreeing to tell that time-honored story, “Charlie becomes a
     writer.”36 To be sure, the fictional character
    Charlie “grows” and “adapts” and “learns” and
    “overcomes obstacles to succeed in the end.” But above and behind Charlie, we sense
    the existence of an entity who does <italic>not</italic> grow and adapt and learn, an entity who
    may well feel, with Susan, that “for a person, adapting is almost shameful; it's like
    running away,” an entity who has been more or less the same since the days of
     <italic>Being John Malkovitch</italic>. Here is where the distinction between Charlie and
    Kaufman, which might seem like a technical issue, actually becomes of prime importance (figs. 5–6). In the
    movie, one might say, Charlie becomes Donald. But, in real life, there is no Donald; in real
    life, there is only Kaufman, someone who is, we assume, an amalgam of Charlie and Donald, at
    once, enduringly, with an inexorable combat being unchangingly waged in his head, that
    marvellous, mysterious head into which Valerie Thomas, in the opening scene, expresses a desire
    to climb. From this point of view, the film is a spurious diachrony concealing a genuine
    synchrony; only superficially the story of how Charlie became Donald,
     <italic>Adaptation</italic> is, at a deeper level, the entirely nonnarrative portrait of a
    never-changing Kaufman.37</p>

         <p>Far from an abject capitulation, then, to the spirit of narrative, <italic>Adaptation</italic>
    is a Hollywood film in which atemporal phenomena score a twofold victory. It leaves us, in the
    end, with the powerful, unchanging beauty of flowers and the strange, unchanging beauty of
    Charlie Kaufman's soul. And it invites us to wonder whether phenomena like these, phenomena
    that do not have a history in the full sense of the word, may not, when all is said and done, be
    the most important ones there are.</p>

               <p>Thirty minutes is a rough figure. The shift begins some time after 1:14, when Charlie asks
      how “the great Donald” would solve the script problem, and ends, depending on
      one's interpretation, either with the deaths of Laroche and Donald (1:41–45) or the

               <p>Nitzan Ben Shaul considers Kaufman's ambition to be that of rendering truth

               <p>It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
       <italic>Adaptation</italic>—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman
      would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for
      the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case that <italic>Adaptation</italic>
      “undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as
      Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on
      Film,” in <italic>Books in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship</italic>, ed.
      Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than
      what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up to <italic>something</italic>,
      and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average
      movie we find easier to read. In fact, <italic>Adaptation</italic> has only solidified
      Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way
      of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to
      imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far
      from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably
      positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.</p>
