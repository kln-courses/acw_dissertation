<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Impact of Party Reform on Party Systems The Case of the RPR in France Kay Lawson A political party is never an end in itself. It is composed of men and women who are seeking control of other institutions or access to those in control, who are in turn sporadically supported by men and women who also seek, to a dif- ferent degree and often for different purposes, access to power. Like any other instrument of power, to be effective for those who use them parties must continually be adapted to changing conditions. The nature of the territory to be conquered or held in subjection changes from time to time: in- stitutional change provokes party change. Opposing forces may develop superior tactics that must be met by at least equivalent advances: party change provokes party change. And the purposes or other characteristics of those who support the party may undergo a transformation: electorate change provokes party change. Each of these kinds of change is usually multifaceted, is seldom found singly, and is seldom entirely absent. Parties live in the vortex of change and to survive must be able to adapt and adapt appropriately. Not all do. Parties may fail to adapt because they are weak and lack the necessary re- sources: leadership capable of recognizing the need for change, channels available for communicating the message of change, followers ready to ac- cept-perhaps even to help create-change. But they may also fail to adapt because they are strong and have alternate, nonparty resources, such as lead- ership secure in governmental positions of power. Party leaders in power may be tempted to respond to change by using the institutions they control to sup- press, or at least to channel and "guide," the transformations they observe. If the institutions of power are inadequate to the task, the party (or parties) in power may attempt to change the institutions. This attempt may work. How- ever, if not carried far enough to include the suppression of dissent, induced institutional change is likely to be only transiently successful; other parties adapt to the changed institutions, and the known fact of manipulation may it- 0010-4159/8110715-00021$05.00/1 ? 1981 The City University of New York 401</page><page sequence="2">Comparative Politics July 1981 self cause a decline in electoral support for the party in power, compelling it to return to the battlefield. If it has been in power for a long time, it will be all the more poorly adapted to the struggle. When a party finds itself seriously outdistanced by change, for whatever reasons (the abrupt end to a long period of shelter in power is only one of many conditions likely to be productive of that result), it must find a way to catch up. Incremental adaptation will be too slow. It will be time for self-gen- erated party reform. (Externally imposed party reform is reform decreed or legislated by gov- ernment and is usually applied to all parties within a system; this article is concerned exclusively with self-generated reform, and the term "party re- form" will be used in that sense only.) Such reform will itself stimulate further changes. Other parties will be compelled to make adaptive changes in response. In a coalition system, the reformed party will interact differently with its alliance partners and may even change partners. The electorate will respond differently to all these changes, shifting loyalties and/or varying the intensity of support offered. Party reform has an impact, inevitably, on party systems. When a key party in a political system announces it is undertaking extensive reform, it is worthwhile to undertake an examination of that impact. In order to do so, it is important to find out first what the reforms really are. There are good reasons why this is almost always a difficult task. Party reform is different from incremental party adaptation not because it is wider-ranging (it may or may not be) and not because it is prompted by moral considerations (it may or may not be). It is different because it claims to be wider-ranging and claims to be morally motivated; it demands respectful at- tention. The mere assertion of reform, if credited, may strengthen the party's capacity to compete. This means, then, that the reforms must be announced in moral terms. Dif- ferent parties (and their supporters) have different notions of how parties might serve moral ends, but one theme is common to all: all political parties, even in totalitarian states, claim to serve as popular intermediaries, as linkage agencies between the citizenry and the state. Although many doubt its feasi- bility, nearly everyone accepts the idea that party linkage is desirable. In order to sustain a claim to respectful attention, parties undertaking reform are al- most compelled to describe that reform as in some way improving the party's capacity to serve as an agency of linkage. However, caveat spectator: when a claim must be made, it must be doubted. A good close look is always in order. These, then, are the considerations that shape the following inquiry into the impact of party reform on party systems. The key example will be the Rally for the Republic (RPR) party in the French party system. Our purpose will be to explain the circumstances forcing the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Re- 402</page><page sequence="3">Kay Lawson public (UDR) to change intself into the Rally for the Republic; to describe the nature of the change, with particular emphasis on the extent to which internal linkage processes have or have not been improved; and to assess, in prelimi- nary terms, the probably impact of these changes on the French party system. A final section will explore, in broader terms, the relationship of party change to system change, indicating how the reform discussed here fits within the postwar pattern of political change in France, and stressing the importance of studying party systems not as fixed entities but as structures that, like all other social structures, change in response to change. This study is based on recent (1977-78) field work in France, including over 100 interviews with approximately equal numbers of RPR militants, local officials, federal officials, and national leaders; and attendance at numerous party meetings at the base, including several called after the elections for the purpose of electing party officers. The field work was conducted in Paris (for contacts with national leadership) and the Department of Les Yvelines (for contacts at the local and federal levels). Why the UDR Changed to the RPR The UDR, first known as the Union for the New Republic (UNR), was formed in 1958 out of a coalition of small groups, some new and some old, which had in common the wish to support the return of General Charles de Gaulle to power in the midst of the political and institutional crisis provoked by Alge- rian rebel activity and the French army's efforts to take control of response to that activity out of the hands of the civilian government, if need be by taking over the government itself. From the beginning, the new party was charac- terized by its unstinting and undemanding loyalty to de Gaulle and by its re- markable and enduring success at the polls.' However, although the UDR was France's strongest party in the Assembly, Fifth Republic France has not been a regime of parties, nor has power been lo- cated in the Assembly.2 De Gaulle created a semipresidential system in 1958, reinforced it institutionally in 1962 by engineering a constitutional amend- ment for direct election of the president, and protected it politically by never according the strongest party, even though it was also the party most loyal to him, the strength in governmental ministries seemingly warranted by its suc- cess with the voters.3 His popular but noncharismatic successor, Georges Pompidou, was obliged to base his power somewhat more directly on the party, but only somewhat. 4 When he died in 1974, at least three UDR leaders announced their readiness to step into his place, but none of them succeeded either in rallying the party or in assuming the presidency. The lukewarm sup- port given Jacques Chaban-Delmas, the candidate who finally carried the 403</page><page sequence="4">Comparative Politics July 1981 party's colors into battle, gave the presidency to Valkry Giscard d'Estaing of the Independent Republicans and the prime ministership to the member of the UDR who apparently did the most to deflect his party's votes to Giscard, Jac- ques Chirac. It seems clear now that the fate of the UDR hung in the balance from 1974 to 1976, and that the scales were held by Jacques Chirac. Never one to act blindfolded, this pragmatic technocrat kept his vision sharply focused on his own political future and saw clearly that the UDR required serious reform in order to survive and that he himself would require a strong party to back his own quest for power. He was no doubt helped to the first understanding by the ease with which UDR voters had been shifted to Giscard even on the first ballot in 1974 and by declining membership rates; to the second by Giscard's tendency to rely more on his minister of the interior, old friend and ally Michel Poniatowski, than on his prime minister, Jacques Chirac.5 Chirac did not wait long to act. Less than six months after the presidential election, he moved in on the party he had betrayed. The power of the prime ministership may have been limited in government, but in party affairs it gave him sufficient leverage to make the post of secretary general his almost for the asking, and in December of 1974, he asked. Efforts by the UDR "barons" (the half-derogatory, half-admiring title given the party's old guard, formerly close associates of Charles de Gaulle) to find alternate leadership more ac- ceptable (and more tractable) than Chirac proved unsuccessful, and the new secretary general was installed. During the next two years, Chirac progres- sively strengthened his control over the UDR and weakened his bonds to the president. When he left the prime ministership in mid-1976 only a few strategy meetings with his closest allies were necessary to rough out the scenario for the next act in the drama. Very soon, the call went out for Assises Nationales Extraordinaires, i.e., a special meeting of the UDR, to be held in Paris, December 5, 1976. At this meeting the party was renamed the Rally for the Republic, and a new set of statutes was adopted.6 How the RPR is Different from the UDR The RPR is a direct continuation of the UDR. The new statutes begin, "there is formed among the adherents to the present statutes an association named Rally for the Republic" (Title I, Article 1) and end, "The present association is substituted for the rights and obligations of the association named 'Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic'" (Title XV, Article 46).7 What then are the changes? In general terms, they may be summarized as (1) giving the appear- ance of "deconcentrating" power to the base, (2) developing new sources of 404</page><page sequence="5">Kay Lawson power by strengthening intermediate agencies of communication and control, and (3) keeping all power, including that newly developed, concentrated at the top. We will discuss each in turn. Giving the appearance of deconcentrating power to the base The most important statutory changes affecting the base are (1) local party leaders are now elected (Title I, Article 4), (2) membership applications may be made directly to socioprofessional associations within the party (Title II, Article 7), (3) French citizens residing abroad may join the party via a new "overseas federation" (Title II, Article 7), and (4) application for membership may be made directly to any party office-local, federal, or national (elimination of the clause stating, "Every application for membership presented to a party office other than the Federal Committee, is considered null"--Title II, Article 10, Statutes of Nice, 1975).8 In addition, the party has recently set up a pro- gram of study groups, is expanding the work of its "leadership schools," and is undertaking to improve the methods of welcoming new members into the organization. Interviewing and observing at the base leaves no room for doubt that these changes are having an impact. The party claims to have more than doubled its membership since the creation of the RPR (from 285,256 to over 620,000), and this claim is echoed and even magnified in its constituencies: "I had 35 mem- bers in my canton [a subdivision of the legislative district] in 1976; now we are 68. "9 And: "We were 200 in this district in 1976; now there are 600, and of those 150 are militants." 10 The party leadership urged that 50 percent of all local party posts be accorded to the new adherents and has invited both old and new members to join study groups and to attend courses in leadership at "centres de formation et de perfectionnement." 11 Jacques Chirac, now president of the party, says, "Since our leader is gone, we must rediscover our Gaullist inspiration at the base and for that we need the members' participation."12 However, only brief reflection is re- quired to realize that all of the above changes may be motivated more by the desire to form a mass movement of committed, informed, and trained milit- ants, ready to follow the party where it leads, than by a felt need to improve the party's means of basing its politics on "intransigent respect for the sovereignty of the people" (Title I, Article 2). And indeed, in interviews with other party leaders this alternate motive was frankly expressed: "A political party is a machine for gaining power." And : "We need members more like the Communists-you cannot talk to a Communist for ten minutes without hearing the Communist position on whatever you are talking about. That's good; that's what we should have." A question regarding a militant's obliga- tions elicits a ready enumeration: recruit other members, paste up posters, distribute tracts, attend all meetings, be ready to do whatever is asked of him. 405</page><page sequence="6">Comparative Politics July 1981 The next, asking what a militant's rights are, is far more likely to provoke doubt, a pause, and often the blunt reply, "I don't think he has any rights; it is much more a matter of obligations." 13 Or the answer might be, "The right to be informed, to know what is going on inside the party, not to have to find it out in the papers." Attendance at Gaullist meetings of district executive bureaus, district com- mittees, district general assemblies, the federal committee, the federal bureau, and selected meetings of youth, workers, and teachers also helps to discover the real meaning for the membership of these changes.14 The same format prevails at all: the chair leads the proceedings with a firm hand, giving a report on local developments. Reports are given by those in charge of various ac- tivities, e.g., for youth, for women, and so on. Then the speaker, if there is one, is introduced. This might be the local deputy, a leader from the next level up of the party, or a party "personality." Finally, the audience is asked if there are questions, and usually two or three questions of information are asked and courteously replied to. Very occasionally, information on a new subject is volunteered from the floor, but this does not lead to the presentation of motions or any other action from the floor. The mood in all might best be described as affable and disciplined. Interviews with militants reinforced this view of meetings. They commonly felt that they were free to speak out if they wanted to, but were most concerned to be given full information by those in a position to know what was going on. Interviewees spoke frequently of the need for discipline, of every organization's need for someone who can make decisions, of an appreciation for order. It is also at local meetings that one can discover how meaningful is the re- form permitting the membership to elect its local chief, the party secretary for the district. Both observation and report suggest that the incumbent secretary is almost always reelected unopposed (the case in the three elections ob- served) and that when he is opposed the choice indicated by the departmental secretary easily carries the day. A district secretary who becomes persona non grata can be removed by the secretary general (Title III, Article 11). Members also elect the party committee for the district. In theory anyone may nominate himself, and some nonofficial nominations are occasionally offered. The most common situation appears to be that a printed "ballot," listing just as many candidates as there are positions on the committee, is passed out and then collected; names may be crossed out and others written in, but this rarely hap- pens. On the other hand, it should not be taken for granted that these still rela- tively new reforms will not produce some democratization of the party. Inter- viewees quite frequently made such complaints as, "It is very hard to move anything up in the party, to reach the higher levels," and expressed the wish that there would be "more real consultation with the base" in the setting of party policy and the choice of candidates for national office (the latter at pre- 406</page><page sequence="7">Kay Lawson sent rests exclusively in the hands of a small committee at national headquar- ters). A few believed meetings should be held more frequently, with more op- portunity for substantive discussion. Not everyone was content with the pro- cedures for internal elections: one woman, just reelected herself to the district committee, said, "To tell the truth, I only knew one or two other names on the list. I am going to write to M. [the Department Secretary] and tell him that next year we must have some system requiring the candidates to present themselves. We should know whom we are voting for." Developing new sources of power by strengthening intermediate agencies for communication and control The most important changes made by Chirac and his advisers are those at the intermediate level of the party, the De- partment Federation. Here, too, statutory changes have been supplemented by further modifications in practice. The net effect has been to strengthen the usefulness of the federations as agencies of communication and control by headquarters, to weaken their capacity to operate independently of the na- tional party, and to build the power base of the national party. The thrust of statutory change has been mostly in the last direction. In the previous statutes, respect for hierarchical channels was strictly enforced, to the benefit of the federations: applications for membership went only to the federal committee (Title II, Article 10, 1975), only the federations were per- mitted direct correspondence with the national direction of the movement (Title I, Article 6, 1975), the federations could call for regional conferences (with the consent of the Central Committee [Title I, Article 6, 1975]), and "electoral problems and internal affairs of the movement" were the "domain of the federations" (Title I, Article 6, 1975). None of these clauses can be found in the party's present statutes. Furthermore, although each federal sec- retary is still named by the secretary general and ratified by the departmental committee, he can now be replaced by the secretary general, with no right of appeal (Title II, Article 11). What national headquarters wants, and good federal secretaries are working to help provide, is an RPR influence in every domain of French life. Merely having more and better-informed members is not enough-the national lead- ership wants these members working purposively within domains appropriate to their lifestyles and interests. In the days of the UDR, the party had a set of functional representatives at the national level who worked, often on a volun- teer basis, to strengthen the party's impact among women, workers, students and other youth, the handicapped, sport associations, educational institutions, local government bodies, and so on. However, inadequately staffed and fi- nanced, and with nearly nonexistent local implantation in most cases, this ef- fort was of little impact until the party was reformed in 1976. Now, what was little more than a part-time pious hope in the UDR is in the process of becom- ing grass-roots reality in the RPR. Functional representatives now are more 407</page><page sequence="8">Comparative Politics July 1981 likely to have a full set of federal counterparts; federal representatives are in turn gradually being provided with district representatives. Supporting struc- tures can be very elaborate and well publicized or discreet and simple-or somewhere in between. One or two illustrative examples will make clearer what is involved in this level of party reform, as well as the key role played by the federations. Action Ouvriere et Professionelle (AOP). The AOP is the Gaullists' answer to left-wing domination of the trade union movement in France. It is not a union and does not operate within factories or other enterprises. It consists instead of various cells (the RPR prefers the word "sections"), each composed of RPR supporters who work in a particular enterprise, join the party via that enter- prise's AOP section, and try to spread the party's ideas among their fellow workers. Intended to be a concrete manifestation of the hitherto obscure no- tions of "participation" first promulgated by de Gaulle (a philosophy of worker involvement in management that calls for sharing profits, holding stocks, and having a voice in decisions and that Gaullists envision as the "third way" between Marxism and capitalism), the AOP has begun to come to life in the RPR. Over 600 sections have been created. The goal is to have over 2,000 in operation, at which point its national representative, Georges Repeczki, optimistically claims it will be "irreversible." At present, resis- tance remains strong on four fronts: workers are afraid that the AOP is too ready to cooperate with management; management fears loss of control over decision-making processes; regular local party leadership resents the loss of revenue represented in AOP dues; and traditional party members are not quite sure what they think of the influx of workers qua workers. The cooperation of the federal secretaries is crucial in finding departmental and district AOP rep- resentatives who will have the patience to repeat the AOP message wherever an appropriate forum can be found and the skill to set up new sections whenever possible. The federal secretary must also encourge regular party ac- ceptance of the AOP, by example and by exhortation. It is not an easy part of his job; as one committed AOP representative put it with a wry smile, "L'AOP gOne." ("The AOP disturbs.")15 The representatives in education. The party's efforts to build influence among teachers represent an entirely different approach but are also dependent on the cooperation and support of the federations. No issue agitates RPR members more than what they see to be the tactics of Marxist indoctrination by left-wing teachers in the public schools. But Gaullist teachers seem unani- mously persuaded they are victimized by left-wing administrators and col- leagues once their politics become known. Respecting this perhaps well- founded fear, the party is simply urging them to join existing "autonomous" 408</page><page sequence="9">Kay Lawson (i.e., not Communist-dominated) parent-teacher associations, as individuals, not as party militants, and to attempt to shift decisions in the appropriate di- rection. In addition, federal level representatives work with local representa- tives to bring teachers together in study groups to help formulate proposals for government action in this area of education. At these sessions, the RPR label is not stressed; where possible, the work is organized around the idea of pre- senting results to the local RPR deputy for his consideration. Teachers who are not party members but who seem sympathetic are also invited to these loosely organized ad hoc meetings. It is delicate work and can only succeed where the federal secretary knows how to set up a local team in touch with local sensibilities. As these two examples illustrate, every domain presents its particular problems. Efforts to organize the RPR women require finding the private set- tings in which women with no experience in public affairs will feel comforta- ble in developing new skills, yet at the same time keeping the women fully in- volved in the life of the party. The youth, too, must be kept involved in the regular party while they are provided opportunities for militantism and so- cializing appropriate to their inclinations. Here the threat is not a drift into privatism, but the contrary: the RPR has a clear and unhappy memory of the days when the UDR youth broke away to endorse Frangois Mitterrand, the Socialist candidate for the presidency! Overseas members are allowed, for local political reasons, to form organizations with a different name "which are really RPR." In short, the stress is on finding the tactics and the leadership that will extend the RPR communication network into all spheres of French life. In this thoroughly pragmatic approach, little thought is given to protect- ing or building democratic processes. Functional representatives are ap- pointed, by the secretary general at the national level, by the federal secretary at the department and district levels, and anyone who does not work out can be summarily replaced-it happens all the time. Keeping power concentrated at the top Throughout most of the lifetime of the UDR it was widely understood that, whatever the statutes might say, central control of the party (itself not particularly meaningful in the days of subservience to de Gaulle and Pompidou) was a matter of informal negotia- tions among "the barons," most of whom owed what power they had in the party to the closeness of their association with de Gaulle and the high govern- ment offices that that proximity had secured for them. As long as the party kept its close ties to popular presidents, it could afford to follow the comfortable old lines of a loose cadre organization, summoning the troops at the time of elections. However, even before de Gaulle left office, signs of the party's attrition in power were setting in, most noticeably in lower returns for the 1967 legislative elections. Recognition of these problems 409</page><page sequence="10">Comparative Politics July 1981 prompted minor reforms at the National Congress of 1967 (Statutes of Lille), most important among them being an effort to expand membership and im- prove local implantation. The impetus for change was undercut in 1968, when student riots and worker demonstrations propelled many frightened French back into de Gaulle's aging embrace, boosting the party's legislative bloc to unprecedented numbers. Nevertheless, the 1967 modifications were crucial in the crisis years of 1974-76: they meant the existence, however rudimentary, of a structure through which the message of change could be communicated and ratified once the party came under the dominion of a leader capable of recognizing the need for change. The 1976 statutes provide a new set of structures at the top, eliminating some, adding others, and changing all the rest. The National Congress is changed from its predecessor in two respects: the new statutes say that there will be substantive preparation at the base for these national meetings and that those with the right to vote are charged with electing the president of the party. To assist in the first, the agenda for the meetings is to be distributed two months in advance to the federations, which in turn are to send it out to the districts. At the end of one month, federations are to send back local relevant propositions to the secretary general. Fifteen days before the meetings the Central Committee, on the proposal of the secretary general, is to establish a synthesis, which is to be submitted to the Congress for the vote.16 The new statutes give special status to the role of the Extraordinary Con- gress (Title V), and indeed that mechanism has already proved a formidable tool for centralized control. In the March 1978 election, the RPR won over 150 seats in the 491 member legislature, maintaining its status as France's leading party. As expected, the party presented a candidate for the presidency of the National Assembly, Edgar Faur6. However, the parliamentary party was divided and gave enough votes to another member, Jacques Chaban- Delmas, to tip the balance to him. Chaban-Delmas has frequently contended, not coincidentally, against Chirac for power within the party (and could not have won without the cleverly marshalled support of President Giscard d'Es- taing's supporters in the Assembly). Chirac was quick to retaliate. An Ex- traordinary Congress was convened within the month to change the statutes so as to exclude any member "named to the Constitutional Council, to ministe- rial functions or elected to the presidency of parliamentary assemblies" from all party offices. The decision was not a popular one in the party, but was du- tifully voted into effect, making very clear the leadership's control.17 The old National Council and Central Committee have in effect been com- bined in a new expanded Central Committee, which now includes all RPR deputies and senators, all federal secretaries, members elected from the dis- tricts, 100 members elected on a national list, and all members of the Political Council not elected by the Central Committee, for a total of approximately 410</page><page sequence="11">Kay Lawson 300. The functions of the Central Committee remain much the same as before, except that no mention is made of regulating the conditions of the association of other groups to the party, and the committee now has the additional func- tion of being able to pronounce, upon the recommendation of the secretary general, the dissolution of a Federation or a District Union (Title VII). In stat- utory theory, each meeting of the Central Committee is to last for two days, with the first day being devoted to the work of six permanent committees; in practice, the committee meets for a few hours at a time, hears speeches, and votes, usually unanimously, for the proposals presented to them by the party leadership.s8 As one member put it, "I don't go anymore; I prefer to sleep at home." The closest equivalent now to the former Executive Bureau is the Political Council, consisting of the president of the party, the secretary general, fifteen members elected by the Central Committee, members appointed by the presi- dent, and the RPR "personalities" who "formerly directed the government of France." This group meets at the request of the president, and prepares rec- ommendations for the Central Committee (Title VIII). In practice, however, the daily work of the national party is carried out by the Executive Committee, an entirely new body, all of whose members are named by the president. How many members it has and what its functions are "are fixed by the president upon the recommendation of the secretary general"9 (Title X), and no mention is made of the frequency of its meetings. The Executive Committee in fact normally meets at least once a week and is composed of those who have been asked to take responsibility for particular functions, for example, four assis- tant secretary generals (for information, associations, participation, and elec- tions) and sixteen national functional representatives (for such domains as youth, the family, aged persons, women, and so on); the closest counselors of President Chirac, who may or may not have official titles; and of course the secretary general and the president. Problems are thrashed out, pragmatically and matter-of-factly, "among friends." According to the statutes, the two top men of the party are the president and the secretary general. According to all informed observers, the top decision maker in the party is the president, who takes advice from whom he wishes. The first secretary general of the reformed party, Jerome Monod, was a skil- led technocrat brought in to give the party the organization and discipline it needed to win as many legislative seats as possible. When his job was finished, Monod left, as he had always said he would, to be replaced by Alain Devaquet, a personable young man whom very few had ever heard of before and who cannot possibly have had any independent power base in the party. A university professor by metier, Devaquet said he was "always ready to return to [the] laboratory," and was indeed replaced in 1979 by a third loyalist, Ber- nard Pons.'9 411</page><page sequence="12">Comparative Politics July 1981 In short, power in the RPR is still concentrated at the top, but in different hands. De Gaulle's "barons" are out; Chirac's "copains" are in, at least so long as they prove useful. Power is greater, thanks to the continuing develop- ment of federal and local structures, but so is its concentration, more and more in the hands of a single man. One of the party's most distinguished former leaders put the matter very simply: "The RPR is a political machine for one man." One of the party's most widely distributed election posters was equally succinct: "Support Jacques Chirac; Vote RPR." And many of the men and women interviewed for this study volunteered, in remarkably uniform lan- guage, "No party counts in France unless it has a leader considered capable of becoming president. We now have that leader in Jacques Chirac." Thus, the RPR is on the way to becoming a presidential party. The ever growing militant base is being trained and closely involved in the leader's crusade. The intermediate leadership is hard-working and disciplined. The superstructure provides for instant popular ratification of the leader's deci- sions and a diligent corps of functional experts to carry them out. It is tempting to employ the anthropomorphic metaphor to summarize the nature of the reforms: the party survived the death of its fathers and achieved responsible adulthood. It recognized that it could not count any longer on be- nign if distant paternalism but must itself wage the battle for control. How- ever, a party is never a single organism, with immutable interdependency among its parts. It is true for now that the party must have its candidate-leader and that the candidate must be backed by the party; it is less clear that upon success the head would still need the body. The Impact of Party Reform on Party Systems: The Case of France Party systems are frequently discussed as if they were (1) permanently fixed systems within larger permanently fixed systems and (2) composed of units (parties) that (a) differ from each other significantly only in ideological orien- tation and (b) are active only within governmental structures and processes. Emphasis is placed on the number of parties in a system and the extent to which one party or one coalition strategy appears dominant in the government of that system. Such an approach is often very useful for understanding how a given government system is functioning at a given time; it is less useful for understanding system change, the role of parties in effecting that change, and the impact of change on parties.20 Nevertheless, change takes place, and one kind of change leads to another. To understand what is going on in a system, to be able to make informed guesses about what may happen next, each kind of change and each example of the kind must be studied. It is an unending job; we may gradually become 412</page><page sequence="13">Kay Lawson familiar with particular configurations of change, but new ingredients are al- ways being stirred into the brew, producing unanticipated effects. The table of political elements is far from complete. The change in the RPR is helping to change the French party system. But the impact it is having cannot be understood without seeing where this latest change fits in the overall pattern of change in postwar France. The change in the international system that flowed from World War II led to changes in the relationship between France and her colonies that in turn provoked internal system change. The move from the Fourth to the Fifth Republic set off other reactions. The institutional change, from a parliamentary to a quasi- presidential regime, stimulated party change, especially among the parties out of power, as manifested first in a quest for federated action (excluding the Communists) and then in the transformation to the loosely organized Section Franqaise de l'Internationale Ouvriere into the more disciplined and more co- herent Parti Socialiste. At the same time, the change of leadership brought changes in government policy, with an emphasis on strengthening the French economy and the role of France in the world. During this period France became more prosperous, and so did most French citizens, but at the same time the gap between rich and poor grew greater. Then the leadership changed again: first de Gaulle and then Pompidou died, removing the two leaders who had been most capable of per- suading the French that the Fifth Republic was--or would bring into exis- tence--the best of all possible worlds. Social discontent and leftist party re- form were ripening and merging; the Socialists and Communists produced an electoral pact and a common program, and more and more voters chose leftist candidates in local elections and expressed a readiness to do so in national elections (and did shift in that direction in the 1967 and 1973 legislative elec- tions). The international energy crisis sharpened the growing sense of malaise. Left-wing party change coupled with the change in electoral prefer- ences provoked further party change. Right-wing formations struggled to re- form themselves into more powerful organizations, the RPR as described in this article, the Giscardists by transforming their Independent Republicans into a newly prominent "Republican party." This, in very broad outline, is the pattern of political change in France from war's end to mid-1977. At each stage of this process, the operative party sys- tem was the transient product of these forces for change, including party re- form. Three quite different party systems came into existence. The first, the postwar party system, was a series of constantly shifting coalitions, forged in the crucible of war, but inadequately resistant to the heat of postwar skir- mishes for power and thoroughly vulnerable to the spreading flames of dissent over Algeria. The conditions that brought de Gaulle to power shifted power within the party system over to right-wing parties, but more importantly also 413</page><page sequence="14">Comparative Politics July 1981 shifted power away from the parties altogether; the new party's most impor- tant characteristic was its powerlessness. When leftist leaders began to seek new modes of party alliance to enable them to take over the presidency, France began moving toward yet another party system, this time a party sys- tem composed of more centralized, more tightly organized parties, maximiz- ing their strength internally and in cooperation with their closest allies, and focusing on the presidency. The support Mitterrand won from the Com- munists and Giscard d'Estaing elicited from UDR supporters demonstrated in 1974 how serious the change was. France's parties were preparing to be pow- erful again, this time within the quasi-presidential system of the Fifth Repub- lic. Then came the beginnings of the campaign for the 1978 legislative elec- tions. Suddenly all was changed. The Socialist-Communist pact broke up, almost completely, in September 1977. In January of 1978, the Republican party joined forces with other small centrist parties to form the Union for French Democracy (UDF). Although this latter move at first seemed consis- tent with the move toward stronger, more cohesive parties, when the UDF began to register candidates in constituencies that earlier electoral agreements on the Right had declared to be the inviolable turf of the RPR, it became clear that division was growing on this side of the political spectrum as well. The result was that France's four major parties went into the elections deeply di- vided, warring more bitterly against erstwhile allies than putative opponents; made only minimal pretense of intra-alliance amity during the period of prag- matic "d6sistements" between the first and second "tours" of the election; and ended by splitting the electorate neatly among themselves; the Com- munists won 18.62 percent of the popular vote; the Socialists, 28.31 percent; the UDF, 23.18 percent; and the RPR, 26.11 percent (the remaining 3.78 per- cent going to smaller groups).21 Since the 1978 election the political battle has if anything grown more bitter and has extended into the internal councils of the various parties. Communists continue to accuse Socialists of moving to the right; the national meeting of the Parti Communiste Frangais in 1980 was characterized as a "congres de denonciation du Parti Socialiste."22 The Socialists claim they are ready to reestablish the pact with the Communists at any time, but have instead been restoring links with international socialism (while campaigning for the Euro- pean Parliament elections in 1979) and have openly discussed the possibility of an all-Socialist government for France.23 Both leftist parties have been plagued by internal problems as well. Communist intellectuals waged an open debate regarding the wisdom of the party's 1977-78 tactics and were only slowly brought back into disciplined conformity with the party line. Socialist leader Frangois Mitterrand was unable to prevent fellow Socialist Michel Rocard either from announcing his candidacy for the presidency or from with- 414</page><page sequence="15">Kay Lawson drawing it precipitously upon his own announcement (observers speculated that Mitterrand had hoped for a decisive victory over his younger competitor in the quest for the party's endorsement; instead, Rocard's speedy and re- spectful withdrawal left him well defended against charges of either Iose majestd or divisiveness-and thus able to resume his battle for the party's leadership at a more convenient moment).24 The parties of the government are almost equally at loggerheads with one another and show similar signs of internal discord. For the RPR the two prob- lems are closely intertwined. Following the advice of close counselors Pierre Juillet and Marie-France Garaud, Chirac carried his denunciations of the poli- tics of the government to new extremes following the 1978 elections. His party's poor showing in the subsequent 1979 European Parliament elections was blamed in part on widespread discontent with Chirac's style, which puz- zled and dismayed those RPR supporters who believed a party "of the major- ity" should not be constantly taking arms against its partners in that coalition. Twenty-four RPR deputies were sufficiently concerned to hold a meeting to discuss how to counteract their party leader's intransigence. Taking the warning, Chirac parted company with Juillet and Garaud, single-handedly re- constituted the Political Council more to the deputies' liking (thus reasserting his personal control of the party apparatus at the same time that he acknowl- edged his need to exercise that control in a manner at least marginally accept- able to other powers within the party), and temporarily softened his attacks on Giscard.25 Such conciliatory tactics had their cost and were only minimally effective in rallying the "legitimistes" back around their putative leader. A sign of the first was Marie-France Garaud's announcement of her own candi- dacy for the presidency; a sign of the latter was the same announcement by former prime minister Michel Debr6 (a far more serious challenge to Chirac's hegemony, since many old-guard Gaullists have never ceased to regard Debr6 as the proper spiritual and ideological heir to de Gaulle).26 Nor did the forces behind Giscard show any signs of being placated by Chirac's momentarily milder tone. On the contrary, Prime Minister Barre lashed out with particular virulence against the RPR's refusal to vote the government' s budget in the fall of 1979, despite that party's promise not to vote for any motion of censure, or against any motion of confidence, brought against or by the government.27 Internally, the small parties composing Giscard's UDF have shown no signs of revolt against the president, but neither have they formed a strong organi- zation to campaign on his behalf. His supporters' losses in late 1980 legisla- tive by-elections and repeated reports of "childish quarrels" within the cen- trist movements indicate that even those seemingly most secure in power are not immune from the centrifugal forces pushing them apart-from each other as well as from more distant allies.28 What are the forces that have acted so relentlessly to halt France's move 415</page><page sequence="16">Comparative Politics July 1981 toward a party system based on rational bargaining by cohesive parties fo- cused on the presidency? Why is it that even when France's parties manage temporarily to coalesce, singly and in alliance, and to make a few of the pragmatic cooperative moves most unambiguously dictated by political real- ity, one can so confidently expect their redivision into warring movements and factions? Four causes of this phenomenon may be suggested. The impact of RPR reforms on the French party system is a key aspect of the fourth. The first cause for the failure of French parties to maintain a degree of coherence and alliance is the fact that France did not adopt a fully presidential system in 1958. Under the terms of the present constitution, the president must govern through a prime minister, and the prime minister must have the confidence of parliament. Any legislature with a firm majority against the president can successfully wrest power back from the president by consis- tently voting against the bills presented by the government. A motion of cen- sure can be filed, or the government's effort to make the passage of a bill a motion of confidence can be repudiated. If the nation were behind it, an op- posing majority could be sustained in the elections that would then have to be called, and the president would be forced either to appoint a prime minister from the opposition or to resign.29 All this means that it is still worthwhile to wage the battle for parliament and to gain as many seats as possible, if only in order to have the power to maintain or break the power of presidents. However, once in Parliament, individual deputies must exercise power (in- cluding the making or breaking of presidents) in conjunction with others-a majority has to be achieved to control Parliament just as it must control the presidency more directly. Thus, the "only a quasi-presidential system" ar- gument cannot stand alone. The second probable cause for the recurring divisiveness of the parties is the fact that the French are still deeply divided over unresolved issues: the role of France in the world, the distribution of wealth, the role of government in the economy, and the extent to which individual liberties should be pro- tected.30 Allowing their opinions on these issues to be aggregated sufficiently to allow the emergence of four major parties, capable of forming only the most tenuous alliances on each side of the political spectrum, may be as far as the French electorate can go for the present, no matter what the institu- tionalized incentives for further cooperative effort may be. The French electoral system has a feature that has received remarkably little scholarly attention but that has sufficient impact to count as our third explanatory factor: the runoff. Because there are so many parties, the only way to get a clear majority in many constituencies for local and legislative elections and in the nation for the presidency is to hold two elections, one a week after the first, between the leaders in the first polling. But this system works both ways: it is partly because there is a runoff that France continues to 416</page><page sequence="17">Kay Lawson Figure 1 System, Party, and Party System Change in France, 1962-81 INDIVIDUAL PARTY NATURE OF PARTY INDIVIDUAL PARTY NATURE OF PARTY SYSTEM VARIABLES RESPONSES SYSTEM RESPONSE SYSTEM COMBINE WITH OTHER PARTIES FOR QUASI-PRESIDENTIAL &lt; PRESIDENCY SYSTEM CONTINUE TO MAXIMIZE INDIVIDUAL PARTY &gt; ARRESTED DEVELOP PARTY'S CENTRALIZED, STRENGTH IN PARLIAMENT DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY TO SINGLE-LEADER OF - PURSUE PRESIDENCY &gt; PARTIES IN PRESIDENTIAL INDIVIDUALLY FURTHER WEAKENED MAINTAIN INDIVIDUAL ALLIANCES ("REFORM") ALLIANCES DIVIDED POLITY - PARTY IDEOLOGICAL PURITY MAXIMIIZE INDIVIDUAL RUN-OFF ELECTIONS - PARTY STRENGTH AT FIRST ELECTION have "so many parties" and that preelectoral alliances are likely to be loose and contingent upon first ballot results. The first vote becomes (and is now often called) a primary election within the alliance, and one week is a very short time to heal the wounds inflicted in a long primary battle. Those who warred throughout the electoral period find it difficult to forgive and forget when the votes are counted. The fourth factor explaining the arrested development of presidency-ori- ented alliances between cohesive parties is that that has been the topic of this article: party reform in the direction of presidential politics. This is not the contradiction it may at first appear to be. The three factors already discussed have the combined effect of making presidency-oriented alliances tenuous and fragile in France, and of ensuring that there will be recurrent periods when the individual parties will operate independently and hostilely vis-h-vis even their closest ideological allies. At the same time, the fact that so much (even if not all) power is now concentrated in the French presidency means that each indi- vidual party has naturally begun to reshape itself in response to the impera- tives of that power. Unable to combine more effectively, each endeavors to transform itself, by itself, into a majority party. Since "no party counts unless it has a leader considered capable of becoming president," a party bent on achieving majority status constantly seeks such leadership and conspires in its own transformation into an electoral machine for that leader. When his chances of success dim, others endeavor to take his place, but the effort to build and/or maintain a powerful party apparatus, characterized by centralized power and a mass membership, does not falter. In sum, at the present writing, institutional and electoral factors (the re- maining powers of the legislature, runoff elections, and divided opinion) keep the parties divided, and a further institutional factor (the powers of the presi- dency) compels those divided parties to try to build strong centralized organi- zations largely subservient to the will of a single leader, who, in the effort to 417</page><page sequence="18">Comparative Politics July 1981 attract attention and support, exercises his leadership in a fashion to reinforce the divisiveness among (and often within) the parties. The relationship among these variables is diagrammed in Figure 1. The French electorate may grow sufficiently weary of this new round of elitist power-seeking to compel change--or otherwise respond in a fashion the parties cannot afford to ignore. Internal factionalism may prevent the emer- gence of unchallenged leaders. Current leaders may be forced out of office by illness, scandal, or death. We cannot be certain what will stimulate the next, set of changes in French politics, nor when it will take place. But understand- ing the nature and interrelationships of past changes suggests what to watch for, how to interpret what we see, and above all, the importance of expecting the party system of France, like all other party systems, to respond to change and to be itself a force for further change. EPILOGUE (May 1981) In the recent presidential election, all the candidates pursued the new strategy of independence. Attacks on former allies were frequent and sharp. Chirac overcame the challenges of Debra and Garaud by winning a respectable 18 percent on the first ballot (to their respective 1.7 percent and 1.3 percent). His lukewarm endorsement of Giscard prior to the second ballot probably in- creased the margin of Mitterrand's victory and in any case helped to dissociate the RPR leader from the former president's fall from grace. Chirac is now well placed to appear as the only possible recours for France when and if her citizens weary of their new experiment with socialism. Thus, for Chirac as for Mitterrand, the strategy of turning a decaying party into a well-organized mechanism and of moving that party free from significant commitment to in- terparty alliances has proved the currently correct response to the ever chang- ing dynamics of the French political system.

Most of this growth took place prior to the 1978 legislative elections and can be ascribed (as it frankly was in many interviews) to the quest of many of the French for some way to combat what appeared to be the serious threat of left-wing victory in those elections. See, for example, the extensive poll data reported in the newsweekly Le Point, September 12, 1977, pp. 46-56, and December 12, 1977, pp. 87-97. 11. To sustain these and other formation efforts, the party has prepared over thirty brochures, which provide the party's positions on issues such as Europe and government policy for the handicapped, copies of several of Chirac's speeches (also available in a full-length volume), and advice on such matters as "How to Act in Your Commune." These small brochures, from ten to thirty pages long, have been printed under the general headings Rassemblement Actualite and Le R.P.R. Propose. They are available from party headquarters, 123 rue de Lille, Paris. Other key party publications are Propositions pour la France (Paris: Stock, 1977) and Discours pour la France d l'heure du choix (Paris: Stock, 1978). The latter consists of the printed speeches of Jac- ques Chirac. 12. Interview, July 1978. 13. It should be noted that this kind of answer came even more frequently from militants (19 percent so commenting) than from leaders (of whom 14 percent gave such an answer). A full re- port of interview data will be presented in a forthcoming study, Political Parties and Change: Rally for the Republic. 14. The author attended meetings in Paris, in a rapidly developing middle-class suburban area, in a well-established, traditional and wealthy area, and in a district approximately half-industrial, half-rural. 15. The AOP puts out its own monthly bulletin, Inter A.O.P., and maintains its own head- quarters at 11 rue Solferino, Paris. 16. However, given past habits of ignoring the more cumbersomely democratic provisions of statutes and present techniques of controlling party meetings, it would be foolish to take these provisions as predictive of what practice will actually be in the future. 17. At the same meeting, the statutes were also changed to make it the secretary general (rather than the federal secretary) who removes an unsatisfactory district secretary and to bring in all de- puties and senators as members of the Central Committee (Le Monde, 11 April 1978). 18.
