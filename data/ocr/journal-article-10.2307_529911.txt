Taylor The University of Texas at San Antonio San Antonio, Texas Five seasons of archaeological excavations have been completed at the NAN Ranch ruin (LA 15049), a pithouse-period and surface pueblo site in sw New Mexico. This research has yielded new information on Mimbres Mogollon architectural and ceramic style change from ca. 800 A.C. to ca. 1150 A.C. The focus of the excavations has been on exploring the east room block of the large Classic Mimbres period pueblo and the underlying structures in- cluding Late Pithouse period pithouses. This study illustrates the complexi- ties in the architectural development of a Mimbres Mogollon pueblo room block and correlates this development to changes in painted pottery design styles. Subtle, and possibly significant, changes in building construction and ceramic styles after ca. 1100 A.C. may signify the onset of cultural degrada- tion that eventually led to the abandonment of the Mimbres region sometime after 1125 A.C. Introduction The basic aims of this study are to illustrate the com- plexities in the architectural development of a Mimbres Mogollon pueblo room block and correlate this devel- opment with changes in painted pottery style. These data have resulted from five seasons of archaeological inves- tigations by Texas A&amp;M University at the NAN Ranch ruin (LA 15049), a large Mimbres Mogollon pithouse- pueblo site in the Rio Mimbres Valley of sw New Mex- ico (FIG. i).I The value of the NAN Ranch ruin data is that it provides evidence for changes in architecture that are evident throughout the surface pueblo, or the Classic Mimbres Period, stratigraphic sequence from ca. 1000 A.C. to 1150 A.C. Clear patterning can be seen in the use of contemporaneous rooms as well as in the strategies guiding the construction and addition of new room suites.2 Given this stratigraphic and temporal control over the architectural and ceramic remains, Late Pit- house and Classic Mimbres periods can be viewed more as a continuum of change or a dynamic system than as static time slots. Previous archaeological excavations in the region were conducted in the 1920s and 1930s3 using controls 1. H. J. Shafer and R. E.

Consequently, though these early investigations provided much infor- mation on the material assemblages associated with the pueblos and with the Classic Mimbres period as defined, these collections can be viewed mainly as static temporal entities. Actual room-block development cannot be traced confidently based upon data gathered from these early investigations.4 Particular information on the ar- chitectural specifics is either not available or was not consistently recorded; this lack of controlled data pre- cludes detailed comparative analysis of pueblo architec- ture. More recent excavators in Mimbres pueblos in the upper Rio Mimbres Valley have had difficulty in tracing room-block development either because of relic hunter disturbances or poor preservation of the architectural remains.5 In this paper we trace architectural and associated material changes occurring at the NAN Ranch ruin from the Late Pithouse period (ca. 550-1000 A.C.) through the Classic Mimbres (pueblo) period (1000-1150 A.C.).6 Mimbres Mogollon Culture History The Mimbres Mogollon culture is an indigenous, ag- riculturally-oriented tradition that began ca. 200 A.C. Geographically, the Mimbres cultural remains are con- centrated in, but not totally confined to, the landlocked Mimbres River drainage in sw New Mexico. It is first recognized by the appearance of shallow, oval pithouses with extended entranceways that are usually constructed on high points of land overlooking the predominant streams, and are associated with plain brownware pot- tery. This Early Pithouse period is referred to as the Cumbre phase in a recent definition and refinement of the Mimbres Mogollon cultural sequence.7 About 550 A.C., oval pithouses began to be constructed in the lower elevations of the valleys. This shift, presumably tied to an increasing commitment to agriculture, is marked by other changes as well, and signals the beginning of the Late Pithouse period. A general shift from oval to rec- tangular pithouse form can be traced throughout the Late Pithouse period. The appearance of decorated pottery, first red-slipped (San Francisco Red) with red-on-brown (Mogollon R/B) followed by red-on-white (Three Circle R/W) and eventually by black-on-white (Mimbres Bold- face B/W) followed by a finer transitional style, which occurred between Boldface B/W and Mimbres Classic Period B/W, provides the hallmarks of the Late Pithouse period.8 4. S. A. LeBlanc, The Mimbres People (Thames and Hudson: Lon- don 1983) 107-109, discusses a pattern of development at the Swarts ruin based on the Cosgroves' unpublished field notes, but does not indicate on what basis the development was traced. Swarts ruin had at least two large room blocks of 45-79 rooms, perhaps unusually large room blocks for a Mimbres pueblo. LeBlanc attributes this circumstance to the reportedly unique location of the ruin as being on the Mimbres floodplain rather than on a bench or terrace overlooking the floodplain. Our recent survey of the site, which is now also on the NAN Ranch, shows that it was in fact situated on a low, broad terrace overlooking a narrow floodplain-a topographic situation al- most identical to that of the NAN Ranch ruin. 5.

In addition to these cobble- adobe masonry pueblos other changes occurred; most notable is the exquisitely painted Mimbres Classic B/W and polychrome pottery. A number of general charac- teristics are used to distinguish this phase.10 Occupation of the NAN Ranch ruin began sometime in the Late Pithouse period, probably ca. 700 A.C., based on the presence of Mogollon R/B and Three Circle R/W pottery in the deeper midden and fill deposits. The settlement was occupied continuously throughout the Late Pithouse period, through the pueblo phase, and terminated sometime between 1125 A.C. and 1150 A.C., at which point the entire Mimbres Valley was abandoned and the Classic Mimbres period came to an end. Archaeological History of the NAN Ranch Ruin The first recorded archaeological excavation at the NAN Ranch ruin was performed by Harriet and Come- lius Cosgrove in 1926, in conjunction with the extensive excavations at the nearby Swarts ruin." Their excava- tions, confined to nine rooms in the western part of the site, went unreported although they did publish illustra- tions of 47 vessels and one plate of jewelry recovered from the NAN Ranch ruin.12 The location of the Cos- groves' earlier excavations was determined in the 1979 Texas A&amp;M University season largely because of their care in leaving walls, fireplaces, and parts of the floors intact. 13 Reexcavation of three of the Cosgroves' rooms (Rooms 30, 31, and 32) also revealed information on their strategy of excavation: e.g., once the walls were defined, either a trench was excavated around three walls of the room, extending beneath the floor in search of burials, or most of the room was excavated. Fireboxes and other structural features were left undisturbed, but most of the subfloor area in that portion of the room opposite the fireboxes was excavated in search of human burials. Their excavation maximized the chances of dis- covering subfloor burials, but did not include the syste- matic recording of room features and doorways, or provide the controls necessary to document clearly mul- tiple-floor surfacing or multiple floors. It was to our advantage, however, that the walls and features were left intact and some rooms were not completely excavated. Digging was done over much of the site in the 1950s by a local relic collector. Controls were clearly lacking in his work, as we may judge from the location and character of the holes he dug. Other unnamed relic hunt- ers also excavated at the site using a strategy of exca- vating a large conical hole, usually along a wall or at the comer of several rooms, and undermining the floors in search of burials. Walls, floors, floor features, and burials were completely destroyed as a result. An im- pressive collection of Mimbres pottery resulted from these uncontrolled works, but, unfortunately, and typical of such endeavors in this region, nothing has ever been published on the material, if indeed adequate records were kept at all. Texas A&amp;M University's initial investigations of the NAN Ranch ruin were largely directed toward 1) as- sessments of the site's general condition in light of the previous excavations, 2) its research potential, and 3) mapping the ruin. A testing program conducted during the first season concluded that although the site was badly disturbed, architectural preservation was relatively good. Also, perhaps more important, a deeply-stratified, tell-like condition with superimposed pueblo wall foun- dations and floors prevailed in the partially disturbed eastern area of the site (designated as the east room block).14 This finding offered a unique opportunity to obtain excellent temporal control of the material remains in the pueblo phase and to examine the human ecology and cultural dynamics at the site. The site was shown to consist of a pithouse village of undetermined size over- lain by a surface pueblo consisting of at least two and possibly three room blocks containing a maximum num- ber of about 100 rooms at any one time. The larger, more obvious room clusters were designated as the west room block and the east room block (FIG. 2). Stratigraphy The NAN Ranch ruin is located on the remnant of a low alluvial terrace (presumably late Pleistocene in age) of the Rio Mimbres system. The terrace is composed of a thick deposit of poorly sorted stream gravels underly- ing a layer of calcareous clay which forms an undulating 9. Roger Anyon, "The Late Pithouse Period," in S. A.

This clay deposit was of major importance to the builders of the pithouses and pueblo rooms since it served as the primary source of adobe used in wall construction and wall and floor plaster during most of the pueblo period construction. Texas A&amp;M University excavations have documented several aboriginal pits with walls scarred by digging stick marks, dug presumably to mine the clay. Overlying the terrace deposits is a thin mantle of alluvial and colluvial material washed from the higher terraces that border the valley to the east. Late phase pithouses were dug into the terrace deposit to various depths, ranging from 40 cm to over 1.3 m. Excavation of material from these pits scattered gravels throughout the upper soil mantle. These gravels eventually became mixed with midden debris from the Late Pithouse period occupations. As the pithouses were abandoned, natural deposits of aeolian and waterborne sediments partially filled the depressions, as was seen in Rooms 14 and 43. The remainder of these pithouse rooms were deliberately filled in by later occupants, especially during the tran- sitional period, as indicated by ceramic types in the fill of Rooms 15, 17, 43, and 52. It is interesting to note that much of the fill in several of the pithouse depres- sions, such as Rooms 14, 17, and 52, consisted of nearly-sterile gravel which was perhaps taken from other pithouse excavations. Overlying the filled-in pithouses was an artificial deposit of midden debris and architec- tural rubble representing a stratified sequence of Classic Mimbres material from the initial pueblo phase to the termination of the Classic Mimbres occupation. An idealized profile illustrating this sequence is shown in Figure 3. The pueblo grew from an initial series of core rooms to a maximum size with three room blocks by ca. 1110 A.C. Many of the core rooms were extensively repaired and reused. In cases where a single room underwent major change within the same four walls, such as con- version from a living room with adobe floor and a formal firebox to dirt-floored room without a firebox, the room designation is shown as 59/12, with Room 59 being the more recent of the two superimposed rooms. The cultural stratigraphy in the east room block is emphasized because of its complexity, not only with regard to the superposition of architectural units but also wall reinforcement, reflooring, repair, and reconstruction of room complexes. The stratigraphy of the east room block illustrates part of a continuum of construction episodes that began with a settlement of the Late Pit- house period. Specific efforts were made to examine the development phase of the pueblo architecture to provide specific data on the settlement's evolution and population distribution. Room descriptions are grouped in a general chronological scheme beginning with the Late Pithouse period settlement and continuing on through a provi- sional transitional period and finally to the surface pueblo period. Late Pithouse-Period Village By the end of the 1982 field season six pithouse structures had been located and partially or wholly ex- cavated at the NAN Ranch ruin. These included the floor remnant of Room 1, and Rooms 14, 15, 17, 43, and 52 (FIG. 2). Rooms 43 and 52 were both large, and were possibly communal structures. The three smaller excavated pithouses, Room 14, 15, and 17, all averaged slightly over 9 sq m, and were subrectangular with extended entranceways. Oval clay- rimmed basins served as fireplaces, except for Room 15 which had no formal fireplace. It is interesting to note that none of these pithouses had slab-lined fireboxes, like those reported elsewhere.'5 Floor features were rare and usually consisted either of postholes or artifacts left on the floor. Subfloor features included pits and burials. Orientation of these pithouse structures varied from east to NW and north (FIG. 4). The presumed function of the small pithouse was for family dwelling. One of the large pithouse structures, Room 43, was subrectangular with a plastered floor, an oval, raised-rim fire basin, and an extended entranceway that was later walled up. The structure had not burned and had no associated floor features or subfloor features. The pit- house had rounded corners, posts set near each corner, and a floor area of about 64 sq m. The pit was later partly filled in by waterborne and aeolian sediments, and by gravel fill containing little cultural material. The ce- ramics recovered from the pit fill were predominantly Mimbres transitional black-on-white (see Ceramic Style Change below). Attempts to date the structure using archaeomagnetic samples taken from the fire basin were unsuccessful. Room 52, the other large pithouse structure, had about 43 sq m of interior floor space and was well preserved (FIG. 5) beneath portions of several Classic Mimbres pe- riod rooms in the east room block. It had an extended entranceway 4.3 m long and 0.6 m wide oriented to the ESE. A circular, clay-rimmed fire basin, with a vertically placed slab that served as a deflector, was located mid- way between the center post and the entrance. Parts of two boldface B/W bowls and a Three Circle Neck Cor- rugated olla fragment were found on the smoothly plas- tered floor. A layer of charred, fibrous, organic material resembling burned corn husks was found along the SE 15. Anyon, op. cit.

Archaeomagnetic samples taken from the burned plas- ter wall were analyzed by the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona and provided a date of 820- 860 A.C. at the 63% confidence level and 740-860 A.C. at the 95% confidence level.16 Rooms 43 and 52 were impressive in their size, sug- gesting that these features may have served as communal structures during the Late Pithouse period.17 Burial patterns for the Late Pithouse period settlement are not clear, but may include both intramural and ex- tramural interments. Three burials were found beneath the floor of Room 14 and a probable (unexcavated) burial was found beneath the floor in Room 17. All of the burials beneath the floor of Room 14 contained two or more smashed pottery vessels. None of the pithouse burials included inverted vessels placed over the heads with "kill" holes, as is characteristic of some late Three Circle Phase burials.18 This mortuary characteristic, like the absence of slab-lined firepits, probably indicates that these structures date to the early or middle portion of the Three Circle phase rather than to the latter part of the phase. All burials were flexed or semi-flexed and one, Burial 86, was wrapped in a diagonal checkerweave mat. Ce- ramic associations included Boldface B/W (Burial 86) and transitional B/W in burial 90, both placed in the floor of Room 14. Several extramural burials, including Burials 4 and 9, have been found that may date to the Late Pithouse period or to the transitional phase. The lack of associated pottery, however, makes confident placement difficult except to indicate that they predate the pueblo construc- tion. Traces of a Transition? Accumulated findings over the past five seasons in- dicate that a number of non-pithouse architectural fea- tures were built prior to the beginning of the surface pueblo development. These features are provisionally assigned to a transitional developmental period associ- ated with the Late Pithouse occupation. As noted earlier, there is no way to prove the association of the features in question with the pithouses, given the present data, but, in light of the stratigraphic occurrence they are worthy of mention. Remnants of possible surface structures preceding the pueblo period occur in the form of posthole alignments and random postholes found in the hardpan surface be- neath a number of the Classic period rooms. For ex- ample, an alignment of postholes was found beneath Rooms 7, 22, and 75C, among others, and another align- ment was found west of Room 50 and extending beneath Room 56. Room 13 was partially overlying Room 14, a pit- house, and was immediately beneath the pueblo floors of Room 12. A portion of the Room 13 floor was con- structed directly on the Pleistocene clay surface. The dimensions of the structure could not be ascertained from the extant data because of subsequent disturbances caused by the construction of the Room 12 firebox and aboriginal excavation of several burial pits. The only feature other than the floor remnant identified in Room 13 was a single post set into the floor. Room 13 did not appear to be a typical rectangular surface room and did not have the more characteristic cobble-adobe wall base. Another possible transitional structure was Room 51, with its adobe floor and remnants of a cobble-adobe wall base. This structure was found beneath pueblo Rooms 46, 47, and 48, but only the SE segment remained intact. Room 48 was an early room in the east room block and attested to the relative antiquity of Room 51. It is un- fortunate that no absolute dates were obtained for it. The floor remnant of Room 51 contained a quantity (several kg) of burned corn-on-the-cob. Efforts to obtain archaeo- magnetic dates on the burned floor were unsuccessful. Although the ceramics from the fill above the floor date mostly to the Classic Mimbres period, the overlying midden does not date the floor. We had assumed previ- ously that Room 51 was an early phase pueblo room, and indeed it may have been, but our excavations on three sides of Room 51 failed to find traces of additional rooms. The area to the north, however, where an ad- joining room would most likely have occurred, was ex- tensively disturbed by pothunting activities. Since we were not able to demonstrate the association of Room 51 with other contiguous rooms, and its alignment was different from that of the rooms overlying it, it is pos- sible that Room 51 served as an isolated, above-ground granary. A situation similar to that of Room 51 existed with Room 23B, which underlay portions of Room 22 and 23A. Much of the floor of Room 23B was destroyed by aboriginal excavations to prepare the first floor of Room 22, but portions of the southern half of Room 23B were preserved beneath the northern half of Room 63)23. No evidence of a wallbase for Room 23B was found. The 16. Rob Sternberg, personal communication, 1982. 17. Roger Anyon and S. A.

The interpretation for the transitional place- ment of Room 23B is admittedly based on negative evidence, but the stratigraphic placement is secure. Stratigraphic and contextual data for a number of bur- ials suggest that they may belong to the transitional interval between the Late Pithouse and Classic Mimbres periods. Four of these (Burials 51, 52, 60, and 65) were placed in the fill of Room 52, either beneath or imme- diately south of Room 57, a room of the Classic Mimbres period, but were clearly not buried by the floor of that room. Two of the burials had associated ceramics: Burial 65, an infant, had a "killed" transitional style (see Ce- ramic Style Change below) B/W bowl inverted over the corpse (FIG. 9F), and Burial 51, an adult, had a red- filmed bowl placed upright at its feet. All of these burials clearly postdate the use of Room 52 (which dates ca. 820-860 A.C.) and predate the overlying early Classic Mimbres period Room 57. Burial 95, intrusive into the fill of pithouse Room 17, contained two transitional style B/W vessels placed upright, one inside the other, at the left shoulder (FIG. 10G, H). This mortuary variability in associated ceramics may document subtle sociocultural changes accompanying the transition from pithouse to pueblo. There are two other burials (4 and 9) that may either date to the provisional transitional period or represent pre-pueblo, possibly Late Pithouse period, extramural burials. Burial 4 was located beneath Room 30, and differed from other subfloor burials because of the com- pact burial pit fill and its placement near the center of the room; Burial 9 was beneath Room 5, and was also in compact fill. Other evidence for a transitional period included tran- sitional B/W Boldface B/W sherds which occurred in midden deposits lying on the hardpan beneath Classic Mimbres period construction. An excellent sealed mid- den yielding transitional style pottery was found in the upper fill of Room 17, immediately north of Room 75C and beneath the floors of Room 16 (FIG. 3). Above-ground structures may have been common- place in the Late Pithouse period villages in the Mimbres area, but evidence for such features would be scant if they were constructed mostly of perishable materials and adobe. Finding architectural features such as postholes and floor remnants sealed beneath sequences of surface pueblo construction episodes at the NAN Ranch ruin raises the possibility that such structures could have been part of the Late Pithouse to pueblo transition. Storerooms constructed contiguously may have formed the core to what eventually became surface pueblos, and Room 75C may be an example of such a transitional period store- room, incorporated later into a Classic Mimbres period room suite. The hardpan was excavated and leveled to build the floor of Room 13, and similar hardpan exca- vations were seen in the construction of the floors for Rooms 51 and 57. Though such excavation into the hardpan would place the floor beneath the level of the surrounding ground surface, we hesitate to refer to such structures as shallow pithouses because the walls are clearly built from the hardpan and, where the wall bases survive, are of cobble-adobe masonry. The Cosgroves reported on a similar situation for their "transitional" rooms at the Swarts ruin.19 The composition of the Mimbres households did change from a pitroom lacking an enclosed storage fa- cility to a surface room with one or more adjoining storerooms. The question here is did the pitrooms have detached above-ground storerooms? Admittedly, the NAN Ranch body of data is not ideal for tracing this development of the pithouse-pueblo transition. The sam- pling area at the NAN Ranch ruin that yielded infor- mation on the Late Pithouse period and possible transitional pueblo development is limited. In addition, we lack secure dates for the individual pithouses, which may or may not have been occupied simultaneously. And finally, the presence of subterranean or semi-subterra- nean structures with cobblestone walls, like those re- ported by Bradfield at Cameron Creek Village, indicates that the NAN Ranch ruin excavations have not provided stratigraphic data on all of the variability noted in the Late Pithouse period/pre-pueblo architecture. Surface Pueblo: East Room Block Underlying many of the pueblo ruins on the surface were older prepared floors that adjoined wall base rem- nants. In some places these were completely razed to make way for new rooms, as seen with Rooms 3, 4/2, 5, 6, 7, 18, and 57. In other instances, the walls were never razed, but were repaired and reinforced, probably with every resurfacing, as seen in Rooms 11/22, 25/75, 16, and 58. During the earlier excavation seasons we interpreted these underlying floors as representing an intermediate phase pueblo development. After five field seasons, however, this interpretation has changed in that we can now demonstrate that these underlying rooms were part of a continuum of changes that occurred during the course of maintaining the east room block. The reconstruction of the east room block presented below will demonstrate this process. The surface rooms of the room block were built 19. Cosgrove and Cosgrove, op. cit. (in note 3) 23.</page><page sequence="10">52 Mimbres Mogollon Dynamics and Ceramic Change/Shafer and Taylor around one or more cores or clusters of rooms. Relative dating of the architectural sequence was based mainly on superposition and wall bonding patterns. More pre- cise dating of the later rooms was made possible by a modest number of dendrochronology dates. Precise cor- relation of the relative ages of detached rooms was not possible because of the lack of stratigraphic continuity and the unfortunate fact that, as a rule, only the latest surface rooms have preserved charred beams for dating. Where possible, tentative chronological placement was made using the ceramic sequence, which was established on more securely ordered contexts. Although there are significant gaps in our data on wall patterning, we feel that the tentative sequence proposed here is generally an accurate one. The sequence is illustrated in Figure 6 in the form of evolutionary stages. The oldest core rooms, referred to here as the main cluster (Stage 1; FIG. 6) in the east room block, were composed of Rooms 12, 19, 27, 28, 57, and 58. Only Rooms 12 and 57 were found sufficiently undisturbed to obtain firm contextual data, and burials and both rooms yielded Mimbres transitional and early style Mimbres Classic Black-on-White (B/W) pottery. Another room group--the north cluster-may have been part of the main cluster, although no actual connection could be documented because of both aboriginal and pothunter disturbances. The north cluster consisted of Room 3, 4/2, 5, 6, 7, and possibly 68 and 69. Even here, there was some superposition as Room 3 was built partly over the ruins of Room 7, and Room 4 was constructed on top of Room 2. All of the ceramics from the north cluster are either early or middle period Mimbres Classic styles and, therefore, the relative age of this cluster is placed after that of the core rooms in the main cluster or in Stage 2 (FIG. 6). The north cluster evidenced a great deal of remodel- ing, as shown by the complex of wall foundations north of and beneath Room 9 and the razing of Room 7. These rooms also had slightly different orientation than did the rooms in the main cluster. A series of major additions was made onto the main cluster of rooms beginning with the construction of sev- eral rooms, including Rooms 26, 48 (both badly dis- turbed by pothunter activities), and, slightly later, Room 40. Rooms 22/23A were subsequently added as a unit. Their construction date cannot be directly determined, but based on later dated room additions it was seen to be prior to 1071 A.C., most likely ca. 1050 A.C., in the middle part of the Classic Mimbres sequence. Rooms 16B, 75C, 38B, and possibly 24, 67, and detached rooms 61 and 62, were added at this time or slightly later (Stage 2; FIG. 6). The older north cluster had completely gone into ruin by 1071 A.C. when a suite including Rooms 8, 9, and 10 was constructed. Room 9 was built in 1071 A.C. and Rooms 8 and 10 were added on in that order; all of these were constructed over the ruins of the north cluster. At approximately the same time, Room 57 was razed and the larger room 18 was constructed over its ruins (Stage 3; FIG. 6). Room 40 was divided shortly after 1080 A.C. to form the 40-46 suite. Rooms 58 and 48 continued to be in use through Stage 3; Room 58 had undergone major interior reno- vations, including the replacement of a single center post by two new posts (probably necessitating a new roof as well), the walling up of a doorway in the north wall that may have led into 23A, probably opening a doorway into Room 48, relocation of the firebox and probably the ceiling hatchway, and periodic replastering of the floor (twice before the renovation and three times after). Benches were built along three walls of Room 58 when the room was originally constructed, and were main- tained throughout its use. It is possible that later dirt floors overlay the more intensively used adobe floors in both Rooms 48 and 58 (such as that seen in rooms 11/ 22 and 59/12), but the pothunter excavations were too extensive to determine just how many floors had once been present in these two rooms. Room 12 was appar- ently abandoned by this time and became a small outdoor work area. Rooms 75 and 16 remained in use, Room 16B was a small living room (Room 16A) converted to a storeroom, and Rooms 75B and 75A (shown only as 75B in FIG. 6, Stage 4) possibly functioned as a com- munal granary. Two suites of rooms were added to the main cluster ca. 1107 A.C. (Stage 4; FIG. 6).20 These were rooms 47, 49, 50, and 54 (the latter room was constructed atop the ruins of Room 18). Room 45 was a huge room composed largely of double-wall construction with a ceiling sup- ported by three massive juniper posts ca. 50 cm in diameter (two were actually found in excavation). Two rhyolite slab column supports or partitions were also found within the room. Room 23A was modified and became 63B and the function of Room 22 shifted at about this same time (if not earlier) to become Room 11, a dirt-floored storeroom connected to Room 10. Room 40 had gone into ruin and Room 46 (originally a small room partitioned within the original Room 40) became a storeroom, possibly connected to Room 48. Room 59 was also in use at about this point and Room 75 had been completely modified, including rebuilding of the west wall, to form Room 25B. Room 16 (and possibly 38B) was in ruin and had been incorporated into a plaza, enclosed on three sides; Rooms 24 and 67 20. Shafer, 1983a loc. cit.

The latest rooms in the east room block consisted of the suite Rooms 55, 60, and 56, which was added onto Room 50 (Stage 5; FIG. 6) along with Rooms 37, 38A, 25A, 59, 63A, and 65. Room 59 was constructed over a converted outdoor work area lying above the ruins of Room 12. Several subtle architectural changes were detected in construction after 1107 A.C. One such change was the occasional substitution of rhyolite slabs in wall construc- tion in place of the river and upland cobbles used prior to that time. Thin slabs and large sherds were also used in ceiling construction. Furthermore, the source of soil for adobe changed from the yellow-orange Pleistocene clay capping the terrace to mud made of midden fill. The later midden mud was far inferior to the clay, as noted in the durability of the earlier walls. Likewise, floors after ca. 1100 A.C., such as those in Rooms 37, 50, and 55, were frequently of poorly consolidated plas- ter or dirt. This change in floor construction occurred in living rooms, where the floors were plastered, but they were so poorly done that they were often difficult to detect archaeologically. Storerooms had no formal floors and the identification of floor surfaces was determined</page><page sequence="12">54 Mimbres Mogollon Dynamics and Ceramic Change/Shafer and Taylor on the basis of stratigraphy, specifically the surface on which the burned superstructure had fallen. All abandoned Mimbres pueblo rooms showed evi- dence of having burned. The burning was periodic and presumably purposeful, though for reasons unknown; it aided considerably in preserving the architectural details of the superstructure and also preserved beams suitable for dendrochronology. The technique of Mimbres wall construction during the early and middle levels was to lay a base course of large cobbles (these were often placed vertically) that was secured with adobe; successive courses of smaller cobbles were then set in adobe to form the remainder of the walls. A similar method often used in the late period was to lay a foundation row of cobbles as the initial course. Height of the Mimbres walls is not known, but a case in point is Room 16, where by measuring wall- fall and then projecting the height of one wall, the ceiling height was estimated as having been ca. 1.5-2m. The superstructure was supported by one, two, or in very large rooms such as Room 45, three center posts. These were mostly of juniper, set near the centerline of the room. Occasionally, additional smaller posts were set near the corners as needed for additional support. Major beams supported a layer of smaller crossbeams which were, in turn, overlaid by a herringbone pattern of reeds and twigs. The details of superstructure con- struction are virtually identical to those seen for pueblo room construction throughout much of the Anasazi area.21 The perishable superstructure was covered with a thick layer of adobe which may have in turn been covered with coarse matting to reduce the affects of erosion; such a checkerweave matting was discovered on the ceiling ruins of Room 11. Classic Mimbres pueblo rooms at the NAN Ranch ruin can be generally grouped into four functional types: living, storage, granary and communal rooms.22 Using wall bonding patterns and tree ring dates, it has been possible to trace the construction of certain households and room suites built after 1070 A.C. Poor architectural preservation and changing room function through time have prohibited the confident identification of room suites of earlier date. Function for the earlier rooms can be assessed, however, on the basis of interior room features.23 Each household consisted of a living room and at least one smaller storage room connected by interior doorways (FIG. 7). Living rooms generally contained slab-lined fire- boxes and sometimes an adjacent slab-lined ash bin; circular, adobe-lined, fire basins were found in Rooms 37 and 47. Other living room features included hard adobe floors, slab-fall remnants of ceiling hatchways, one or more wall vents, and from two to 17 subfloor burials, which were usually placed on the opposite end of the room from the fireboxes or fireplaces. When fire- places were present in store rooms, they were usually small basin-shaped features in the floor. Store room bur- ials, when they occurred, were usually children or in- fants placed just inside the doorway connecting the store- room to the living room. The entrance to Mimbres households from the outside in the east room block was usually through a ceiling hatchway located above the firebox that served as a smoke vent (Room 25A was one possible exception). Vents were often placed in the walls near the firebox in living rooms. Two rooms that could not be definitely assigned to specific room suites had specially prepared floors. One, Room 7, had a slab-paved floor covered with a thick layer of adobe; the other, Room 75A/75B, had two superimposed floors of cobblestones covered by a thick layer of adobe. Since storerooms usually lacked formal floors, and neither of these rooms had formal floor fea- tures to suggest functions other than storage, it is sug- gested that they served as granaries; the reinforced floors presumably represented attempts to make the rooms free from rodents. Another possible transitional period gran- ary room-Room 51-lacked the cobble-reinforced floor but had a thick adobe floor. Since these three rooms were not demonstrably part of a household, it is possible that they were communal in function; i.e., they may have served as a central storage facility for adjacent households. In addition to storage rooms and the possible use of granaries, subfloor storage facilities were apparently maintained. These frequently occurred beneath the floors of living rooms and consisted of deep oval pits. Two of these still contained large corrugated storage jars or ol- las. Another held a sealed Mimbres Classic B/W olla containing squash (Cucurbita sp.) remains.24 Mimbres Classic household work areas included the use of more than just the household rooms; the flat roofs also served as activity surfaces and metates have been found on top of collapsed ceiling debris. Plaza areas and surfaces immediately adjacent to households have yielded additional evidence of space use such as paved 21.

This suite was added late in the building sequence and is shown as an example of space use in a Classic Mimbres household. adobe work surfaces usually associated with basin- shaped, adobe-lined firepits, metates, and rock-paved earth ovens. The processes documented here illustrate how indi- vidual rooms changed through time with regard to func- tion and suite alignment. Also, subtle but important changes in the Mimbres architecture were noted and described. After ca. 1100 A.C., the Classic Mimbres period structures were more poorly built, less rectangu- lar-i.e., more varied in shape-and interior supports became notably smaller. The indication is that the formal traditions that originally guided the construction of hous- ing and storage facilities began to wane and presumably signalled a gradual breakdown in the overall cultural system. Since these material changes may have preceded a major breakdown in the overall value system of the Mimbres culture, attention is focused below on the sty- listic trends in the painted pottery, which could be re- flecting changes in ideology. During the Mimbres Classic period, burials were placed either beneath the floors of rooms (the predomi- nant number of burials occurred in living rooms) or in a plaza or other open area adjacent to the room blocks. The body position was predictably flexed or semi-flexed and, in intramural burials, the corpse was oriented in the direction of the nearest wall and not in accordance with a specific cardinal point. No specific orientation seems to have dominated extramural burials. Individuals were placed on either side, the back, the stomach, or nearly sitting. Traces of textile impressions indicated that most, if not all, were wrapped in some kind of finely woven textile; Burial 15, a female, was wearing a cordage apron-like garment. Burial data are summarized in Table 1. More than 50% of the Classic Mimbres burials at the NAN Ranch ruin were associated with a single hemi- spherical ceramic bowl inverted over the head (TABLE 1). Two burials had more than one associated vessel. One, Burial 64, contained a smashed Classic Mimbres B/W bowl placed over the head and another broken transi- tional B/W bowl over the body. Burial 37, a child, had three Classic Mimbres bowls in association; one was placed upright beside the head and two were inverted and crushed (apparently by post-mortem pressure) over the head. More often, the vessels had a "kill" hole punched through the bottom in lieu of having been smashed. While in one example the hole was drilled, in another it was punched and reamed out. Vessels were struck from either the inside or outside to produce the kill holes. Ceramics at the NAN Ranch ruin were asso- ciated with individuals of varying ages, ranging from infancy to advanced adulthood. All burials associated with mortuary vessels occurred in rooms. To date no Classic Mimbres extramural burials have been found associated with mortuary vessels, although this pattern apparently does not hold true at other Classic Mimbres pueblo villages.25 Associations other than pottery in- cluded jewelry in the form of strings of beads around the neck or one or both wrists. Pendants of turquoise sometimes occurred in these necklaces and arm bands, and may also have occurred by themselves as ear bobs or as pendants to be worn on the wrist. Single occur- rences of Glycymeris shell bracelets have been found with two burials. Adolescents and adult burials were customarily cov- ered with a layer of large cobbles, discarded usable metates, or manos fragments of a rhyolite slab broken for the purpose. Large sherds may also have been used as covering material. Infants and small children were often not covered with stones. Cremations have been found in the Mimbres region, but at this writing none have been recovered at the NAN Ranch ruin. Ceramic Style Change All categories of material culture are undergoing anal- ysis to detect change in the Mimbres cultural system. The present study focuses on ceramics recovered from 25.

These include pottery vessels left on floors and mortuary vessels located beneath specific floors of both Three Circle phase and Classic Mimbres period structures. The ceramic sequence for the Three Circle phase and the Classic Mimbres period includes plainware, redware, and corrugated wares. A generalized sequence of Mimbres Mogollon pottery development with regard to form and textured surface is shown in Figure 8.

San Francisco Red has a thick red slip that is polished to burnished and has a dimpled exterior. It first occurred during the Georgetown phase and continued, though in diminished frequency, through the end of the Three Cir- cle phase. The first Mimbres corrugated type is Three Circle Neck Corrugated, which developed out of Alma Neck Banded, and occurred predominantly during the Three Circle phase. Corrugations occur on the neck area of Three Circle Neck Corrugated jar forms, as the name indicates. The surface area covered by banding or cor- rugations on jars increased through time, from Alma Neck Banded to Three Circle Neck Corrugated, and culminated with Classic Mimbres Corrugated, which has corrugations on either the upper half or on the entire body of the vessel. The holding capacity of these vessels increased with the successive banded and corrugated wares, with Classic Mimbres corrugated jars being much larger in capacity than the two earlier types. Classic Mimbres Corrugated replaced Three Circle Neck Cor- rugated, and was made during the Classic Mimbres pe- riod (FIG. 8).26 Two formal black-on-white pottery types that char- acterize the Three Circle phase of the Late Pithouse and Classic Mimbres periods are Boldface B/W and Mimbres Classic B/W, respectively.27 There is no distinctive break between the two types, but rather a transition of over- lapping motifs and attributes evolving from Boldface to Classic. This transition has been observed by others.28 LeBlanc describes the transition between the two types but stops short of defining a formal type: We tentatively suggest that the following stylistic evolu- tion occurred. Boldface began with very bold motifs, cur- vilinear scrolls, and an absence of hatched elements. Late in the sequence hatchure was occasionally accomplished by using wavey lines as the hatching element. Design elements 26. Anyon, 1980 op. cit.

Ceramic associations with rooms, including vessels either on floors or in burials. extended to the rim of the vessel. The transitional style is seen as having an improvement in the execution of the painting and more varied designs. More objectively, we see that the hatchured elements can be distinguished from its later Classic form in that either (1) the hatching lines extend into a large, solid element (sic) or (2) they are bounded by lines much wider than the hatching lines. In either case, the designs still extend to the rim.29 More recently, LeBlanc labels Boldface, transitional, and Classic as Mimbres styles I, II, and III respectively, giving the transitional style status equal to that of Bold- face and Classic.30 Evidence from the stratigraphic excavations at the NAN Ranch ruin generally supports LeBlanc's se- quence, but indicates that the changes from Boldface to Classic include more changes than just distinctions be- tween hatchured elements. The ceramic vessels from mortuary and room floor (using vessels on the floors) contexts were ordered by the architectural sequence de- scribed above. Although the effective sample is rela- tively small-numbering ca. 60 vessels-the stylistic trend is revealing (TABLE 2). The ceramic sample clearly bridges the transition from Boldface to Classic B/W. Boldface B/W vessels (not illustrated) were recovered from Room 52, the Late Pit- house period kiva that dates ca. 820-860 A.C.; Late style Boldface B/W was recovered from Room 14 (FIG. 9B-D) and an early style transitional (FIG. 9E) was recovered from another burial pit in the same room. Late transi- tional B/W vessels were recovered from burials in the fill of Room 52 (FIG. 9F), predating the construction of Room 57 which yielded an early Classic Mimbres style (FIG. 10C), and from a burial beneath Room 75C (FIG. 9 G, H). Red slipped pottery, presumably derived from San Francisco Red, was recovered from a burial in Room 14 (FIG. 9A) dating to the late Pithouse period and from the fill of Room 52. Red-filmed vessels have not yet been recovered from Classic Mimbres period context at the NAN Ranch ruin. Late transitional B/W has been recovered from Room 12 (FIGS. 9I, 10A), which also yielded early Classic Mimbres B/W (FIG. 10B, D-F) and even Middle Classic Mimbres B/W style (FIG. l lC, H, I).

Late style Mimbres Clas- sic B/W vessels are shown in Figure 12. The two vessels shown in Figure 12H and 121 are the very latest Mimbres ceramic vessels recovered from the site based on archi- tectural stratigraphy. A tentative placement of certain design elements in the time segment of the Classic period is suggested using the NAN Ranch ruin data. Curvilinear scrolls, for ex- ample, began as a Boldface motif and continued into the Classic style. They were ever more finely executed and become incorporated into the more complex designs dur- ing transitional and Classic periods (FIGS. 9G; 11A, 11E). Although the majority of transitional bowls were not bordered or framed at the rim, a few examples do exist. One specimen illustrated by LeBlanc3" is bordered and the Cosgroves illustrated several framed transitional ves- sels which they classified as Boldface.32 A cursory ex- amination of the Cosgroves' illustrations shows that 16 of 38 vessels that, using LeBlanc's criteria, we would classify as transitional, demonstrated bordered designs. Definition of Classic style as hatchured elements bor- dered by fine lines seems to us a valid distinction, but the development of framed or bordered designs was gradual and was not an early Classic universal. Unbor- dered designs continued only into the early segment of the Classic period (i.e., prior to 1050 A.C.) (FIG. 10B, C), and framing designs at the rim began in the transitional period (FIG. 9I). Almost all design panels were framed by the middle Classic period (i.e., ca. 1050-1100 A.C.) and became a trademark later in the Classic. Bold lines bordering both geometric and naturalistic designs ex- tended through the Classic period. Framing occurred at the bottom of vessels as well as below the rim. Center or bottom frame elements evolved from non-existent (as in Boldface B/W and most tran- sitional B/W styles) (FIGS. 9C-E, G-I; 10F) to a square frame set in a four-quadrant design field in the early Classic (FIG. 10C-E) which occurs on bowls with unframed rims as well as with framed rims. The square frame in the bottom was short-lived (recovered only in Rooms 12 and 57) and quickly gave way to the bottom round frame (FIG. liB, C), completing the middle Classic period design characteristics. Multiple fine rim-frame lines accom- panied by one or more bold lines was also a middle Classic period characteristic (FIG. liE, I) although only a few of these vessels may have survived into the late period (i.e., ca. 1100 A.C. and later). Extended rim lines, that is, a lip band that carried over onto the interior and formed a thick rim band (FIG. 12A-C, E, F, H), were a late characteristic in the NAN sequence and occurred on both rare deep flower pot bowl forms (FIG. 12A) as well as the common hemispherical bowls. Some flower-pot forms were slipped and painted on both surfaces. The interior designs of bowls painted with extended rim lines in- cluded both naturalistic and geometric elements and the geometric were among the most exquisitely painted and complicated geometric designs of the Mimbres culture (FIG. 12A-C). Naturalistic designs were also found with a single extended rim line as were flower-pot forms that were slipped and painted on both surfaces. Hemispherical bowls were the most common vessel form throughout the Classic Mimbres Phase. The flat- bottom flower-pot bowl form occurred in the middle as well as the late period, although the large forms were all late. Other bowl forms included flared-rim bowls, which occurred predominantly in the middle period but which survived late; an oval bowl, which occurred in the early period; and rare saucers or plates in the late period. Other painted vessel forms included the tecomate or seed jar, narrow neck jars or ollas, and rarely effigy vessels.33 No effigy vessels have been found in sealed conexts at the NAN Ranch ruin although sherds occurred in both middle and late midden contexts. Mimbres Classic polychrome was rare at the NAN Ranch ruin and has not been found in mortuary or oth- erwise sealed stratigraphic context. Sherds, however, occurred in midden deposits that generally postdated 1050 A.C. Discussion The dynamic processes of a cultural system result in changes in the material assemblage of that system through time. When several components of a cultural system are observed changing at approximately the same time, it is assumed that the cultural system was making a significant shift in adaptation and/or social organiza- tion. Even with the demonstrable continuity in the ce- ramic technology and design styles, changes in the Mimbres cultural system ca. 1000-1025 A.C. were sig- nificant. Given the horizontal and vertical stratigraphic controls exercised on the NAN Ranch ruin data, efforts have also been made to document sudden changes after 1100 A.C. that may provide some clues as to how and why the Mimbres cultural system collapsed and the re- gion was depopulated. There is a subtle hint-but un- fortunately nothing beyond that-indicating changing 31. LeBlanc, 1976 op. cit. (in note 3) fig. 30. 32. E.g., Cosgrove and Cosgrove, op. cit.

This hint consists of examples of Mimbres Classic B/W vessels recovered from mor- tuary context in the latest dated room suite (Rooms 55, 56, and 60) that were so badly worn that the designs were nearly obliterated (FIG. 12H, I). Visible use-wear was not uncommon on mortuary vessels of the Classic Mimbres period (FIG. 12D) but the wear on the above- mentioned specimens is exceptional.34 This pattern of vessel wear suggested that the production of Classic Mimbres B/W and corrugated greatly decreased or ceased prior to the site's abandonment. Painted vessels were perhaps being used for many more purposes than originally designed. The Mimbres commitment to agriculture presumably increased through time paralleling the growth in popu- lation, especially from the Late Pithouse period through the Classic Mimbres period.35 This shift to above-ground dwellings may have been stimulated by either the need to expand storage facilities within the household or by increased family size. Pithouses offered a distinct dis- advantage in terms of increasing the indoor space needed for storage: once a pit was dug and a pithouse con- structed, the only way to expand inside storage space was to construct a new, and bigger pithouse or to build separate storage facilities. The mean size for pithouses in the Mimbres Valley for the Late Pithouse period is 15.1 sq m.36 This figure is smaller for the few family-size pithouses at the NAN Ranch ruin, which averaged slightly greater than 9 sq m. Flexibility in space needs was provided by the con- struction of surface pueblo suites. The addition of rooms, partitioning of larger rooms, and conversion of store- rooms into living rooms, or vice versa, were all possible without changing the original structure. This flexibility was presumably advantageous not only for enhancing the storage facilities but also for accommodating changes in family composition through one or more generations. It is reasonable to assume that the family composition of households may have changed as the surface pueblo living style was adopted, given the proximity that family members shared. This may have provided the opportu- nity for a greater number of close kin to reside adjacent to one another. It is not surprising that the archaeological consequences of these changes are manifested in the maintenance of plaza areas and communal structures in each room block for communal ceremonies and visual displays of ideographic symbols (including those on ce- ramics) that served to reinforce the altered residence and social patterns. Some have argued that the abstract representational and naturalistic motifs in the Mimbres pottery commu- nicated mythological themes in the ancient Mimbres world view.37 Assuming that the visual expression of world view was communicated throughout traditional ceramic art,38 the rapid changes in the expression of traditional folk themes of the Mimbres displayed on painted pottery from the transitional to the Classic Mimbres period may signal a rapidly changing world view, perhaps-as argued above--correlated with the new residential pattern. Are the changes in ceramic designs and residential pattern closely tied to the Mimbres subsistence technol- ogy and agricultural risks? The extent to which changes in ceramic art paralleled the possible shift to irrigation technology or an intensification in the irrigation networks is unknown: the need for intercommunity cooperation necessary in the Mimbres Valley, however, given the single, limiting water source, may have been achieved through a very strong integrating belief system rein- forced by frequently communicated symbols and village (or possibly room block) exogamy. Uniformity can be seen in most aspects of the Mimbres cultural system from one village to the next, especially in the architec- ture and ceramic assemblages. One important contribution that the NAN Ranch ruin study can provide is comparative information for the critical evaluation of the extant data from older exca- vations. Site destruction by private and commercial pot- hunters in the Mimbres Valley has been so thorough that opportunities for future extensive excavations are ex- tremely limited.39 Restudying the field notes from pre- vious excavations has been one way of formulating and testing hypotheses regarding certain aspects of Mimbres archaeology, such as correlating room size with function and projecting population estimates for specific periods of time.40 The success of such research, however, rests 34.

Our reexcavation of rooms first investigated in 1926 at the NAN Ranch ruin by H. S. and C. B. Cosgrove41 provides some insight into both the procedures and shortcomings of excava- tions at the nearby Swarts ruin, which was a large Mimbres pueblo located ca. 3 km upstream from the NAN Ranch ruin. If the Cosgroves' NAN excavations can be used to assess the Swarts data, then vents, door- ways, and fireboxes were not systematically documented in their Swarts ruins excavations. Since room function can best be correlated with specific features, systematic recording of such features is crucial in evaluating the structure of any particular room block. Excavations at the NAN Ranch ruin have shown that it is possible to define room suites and households in situations where room modification had not changed sig- nificantly over time. Room alignments and functions, however, often changed significantly in the interior por- tions of the room blocks where the space limits were fixed regardless of room size. Also, exterior rooms had the shortest use-life; they were frequently completely razed and new rooms built over the ruins, usually ig- noring the old wall bases. This pattern does not support the hypothetical reconstruction of the Swarts ruin room blocks proposed by LeBlanc.42 He does not provide any clue as to the basis of his reconstruction, but considering the quality of the field data from the Cosgroves' work at the NAN, cited above, the Swarts data would seem to be lacking in accuracy and detail. Because of the complexity of room-block development documented at the NAN Ranch ruin, it seems highly unlikely that the same wall footings would be followed throughout a room-block's history at the Swarts ruin. The point to be made is that history and variability in Mimbres architecture are far more complex at the NAN Ranch ruin than is indicated by the published data on the Swarts,43 Cameron Creek,44 Galaz,45 and Mattocks ruins,46 all large Mimbres pueblos. Yet, when one ex- amines the material assemblages from each of these ruins, the temporal span and stylistic variability is strik- ingly similar, suggesting that the NAN Ranch ruin is not unique, but rather that it provides a more nearly accurate example of Mimbres pueblo architectural variability. Summary The architectural data from the NAN Ranch ruin il- lustrate the complexities in the evolution of the Mimbres pueblo room block. Once a room was built the integrity of the enclosed space was not necessarily maintained throughout the history of the room block. There are instances in which this was the case with interior rooms, although through renovation their functions may have been changed. There is also extensive evidence of room destruction, rebuilding, and the addition of new room suites. Exterior rooms were more subject to razing and total rebuilding than were interior rooms. These archi- tectural changes were attributed to the changing com- position, size, and space needs of the occupying families, coupled with the generally short use-life for the cobble-adobe buildings themselves because of ero- sion through weathering and human activity. The processes of community integration in the context of evolving agricultural societies is a fascinating one that involved a shift from round structures to rectangular ones; this is generally true in the American Southwest47 as it is in western Asia48 and China.49 Furthermore, major adjustments in community organization predictably ac- companied changes in symbolism such as one might find in ceramic art. The NAN Ranch ruin findings document this change in the form of a continuum throughout the late Mimbres sequence. The Mimbres cultural system underwent changes that were reflected in the changing material culture. For the most part, the changes can be seen as having been progressive, but after ca. 1100 A.C., they become degressive and denoted a rather sharp de- cline in the cultural system. To be sure, the Classic Mimbres period was short, lasting only ca. 100-125 years, or about five to six generations. The dynamics of the Mimbres cultural system were also reflected in the changing art styles displayed on the painted pottery. The cultural expression achieved in the painted pottery was presumably a response to the need to communicate the value system that was aimed toward integrating the Mimbres population into a unified, co- operative group. The disappearance of the Mimbres ce- ramic tradition is not surprising, given the breakdown in the cultural system itself. Folk art of a primitive society 41. H. S. Cosgrove and C. B.

Addendum Since the submission of the original draft of this manu- script, nine additional dendrochronology dates have be- come available. These dates, while providing an interesting test, do not change the proposed architectural or ceramic style sequence in any significant detail. They do, however, provide additional information on the dy- namic changes that apparently manifested themselves almost annually in the history of the east room block. The specimens (TABLE 3) are discussed with references to their University of Arizona Tree Ring Laboratory catalogue numbers. Discussion Given the potential errors of interpretation for tree- ring dates outlined by Bannister,5' specimens NAN-88- 90 provide little useful information in tracing the archi- tectural development of these respective rooms.

The room was refloored twice (63A and 63B) and its function evidently changed with the second reflooring. The date may pertain to the orig- inal construction of 23B which we had originally esti- mated as ca. 1071 A.C., on the basis of wall bonding and associated ceramics. The problem of beam recycling and repair or replacement of the roof is acknowledged, al- though there is no archaeological evidence of roof re- placement, such as that seen in Room 25/75. We are inclined to interpret the date as the time when Room 23B was constructed. Room 11/22 dates also provide some interesting pos- sibilities with regard to dating room function changes. Room 22 was a small, extensively used living room whose floor was replastered several times but whose function evidently remained the same. Room 11, which had no formal adobe floor, represented a later use of the same space, presumably as a storage room. Again on the basis of wall-bonding patterns and ceramic associa- tions, we projected the date of construction of Room 22 to be ca. 1050 A.C. If sample NAN 89 relates to this construction, then the projected date is close. In view of the fill sequence above the floor of Room 22, we as- sumed that the space was abandoned for a time of suf- ficient duration to allow for some trash accumulation within the four walls. At a later time, the space was again roofed to form Room 11; this episode was believed to have occurred ca. 1107 A.C. If the NAN 90 date pertains to this rebuilding, then the modification oc- curred somewhere less than 20 years earlier than ex- pected. Overlying the ruins of Room 16 was a deposit of construction debris containing a metate, burned roof tim- bers, and a few large sherds. This space was, at the time of debris accumulation, walled on three sides with the south side open to a plaza. Two vague surfaces that correlated with the plaza surfaces were recorded. Note, for example, in Figure 3 the floor surfaces labeled as Room 35. Evidently, this roofed space was constructed along with Room 25B since the dates are compatible. 50. M. H.

The projected date for Room 25B was ca. 1107 A.C. Room 25B rep- resents a major rebuilding using the wall bases that were formerly Room 75. Rebuilding the walls necessitated the construction of a new roof which in this case required the procurement of new beams. These new dates corroborate the projected dating of specific architectural events and provide additional evi- dence for the constantly changing conditions within a Mimbres pueblo room block. While the first four dates do not in themselves provide specific answers, they do provide new insights into the complexities in the histories of the respective rooms. The dates from 25B are partic- ularly helpful in dating this room, as well as providing relative dates from the three floors below and the one above. More specifically, these dates show that at ca. 1100 A.C. significant modifications were being made in this portion of the east room block. Harry J.
