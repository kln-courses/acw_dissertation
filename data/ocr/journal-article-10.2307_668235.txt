Reviewed by KATHARINE LUOMALA, University of Hawaii These three books are attractively presented, intelligently written, leisure-time reading for anthropologists who may be inspired like myself to ponder why their pro- fessional journal should be reviewing them at all, particularly since one of the authors, Watts (The Two Hands of God, p. xv), remarks that since he does not believe that myth- ology has yet reached the status of a science, he has selected materials chiefly on the basis of philosophical and literary considerations. Watts (ibid., p. 12) feels, and I would not argue the point, that the historical approach, while having merit, has been greatly overemphasized in studies on mythology, a science (his own term here) that "is, for the most part, an antiquarianism or, insofar as it is a study of existing primitive cultures, a sort of scientific game .... " Does not this sound familiar to anthropologists considering the past of the discipline of anthropology as a whole? Freud's and especially Jung's theories, Watts continues, have the merit of taking mytholov c~Zrioiiclv and of studying "it as something still powerfully operative in the modern world, and, at least in Jung's case, of regarding it with all the respect due to a source of wisdom." Watts' own approach, and indeed that of the other two authors in this series also, is not "formally Jungian." It is eclectic, but the influence of the concept of the archetype is prominent. These books, while not anti-science, seek other organizing principles than those offered by science alone. The approach of these books out-anthropologizes the anthropologists who have tra- ditionally wide-ranging interests in both the topical and the spatial aspects of culture from its very beginnings to the present and hope that somehow they can unite the humanities, the social sciences, and the physical sciences into a unified science of Man. They have sought to encompass both the concrete and the abstract, the similar and the different, and the scientific and the romantic view in their investigation of man and his culture. This quest for integration and organization within a single framework has proceeded side by side with increasing specialization in subjects, areas, and sub- disciplines until, at the other extreme, culture as one of the integrating concepts is being argued out of existence, and one can no longer call someone an anthropologist without explaining immediately what kind. These three highly readable non-anthropological books which draw, however, upon anthropology for theory and example seek to integrate this contribution with theory and example from the humanities at large. Thus, examples from orally transmitted chants and narratives of Polynesia, Australia, Europe, the New World, and Africa, and theories of Tylor, Marett, Radin, Leenhardt, and others are blended with examples from the Christian Bible, the Hindu and Buddhist scriptures, Emily Dickinson and other western poets and theories of Jung, Otto, Wach, Eliade, and Campbell, to name but a few. The books attempt to add to the understanding of myth as a whole beyond its spatially and temporally variant forms; such added appreciation as one obtains of specific myths comes from this generalized aura. Anthropologists have more often started with specific myths and themes and worked either toward generalizations or</page><page sequence="3">962 American Anthropologist [66, 1964] toward greater fragmentation of the specific (the latter approach itself based on a generalization). Despite great popular interest in mythology, we have seldom sought, as these books do, to relate it meaningfully, or even to consider it as meaningful, to modern man. These three volumes, which in a short review cannot be adequately discussed, make up the first part of a two-part projected series called Patterns of Myth. This first part, "Myth and Experience," relates to mythological themes on the structure and the dynamics of the cosmos; the second part, "The Human Image," will concern three anthropomorphic images, the father god, the goddess, and the hero, through which man seeks further comprehension of the universe and his role in it and his relation to the rest of mankind. The books have a fresh, unhackneyed quality because the writers have particularly sought to choose examples that are less likely to be familiar to the non-professional reader of mythology; examples from the Greek and the Scandinavian are less commonly present than those from outside the western tradition. The books set a high standard for works of this kind, for sources of examples and illustrations are cited and acknowl- edged, the plates and figures are listed and described, the work is indexed, and technical matters as a whole reflect a firm and sure editorial hand at the helm. Watts, besides contributing a volume to this series, is the general editor. Each book, while readable independently of the others, has the same general basic organization with, however, sufficient variation so as not to be monotonous in form. Each author presents his com- mentary and interpretation with examples so that each book seems to be approximately half interpretation and half example.</page></plain_text>
