Brussels: Éditions Latomus. 2009. 340 pp. ISBN: 978-2-870-3 1 26 1 -2. 48 Euros. For better or worse, chalcenterosis is prevalent among Vergilian commentators in the 21st century. This brisk and gutsy volume, Fratantuono's second book on the Aeneid to appear in about two years, joins almost a score of his Vergilian articles and reviews published over a slightly longer span. His preface also announces a forthcoming monograph on Ovid's Metamorphoses and a commentary on Aeneid 5. His present commentary arrives at a time when Aeneid 1 1 has emerged from centuries of relative neglect to become the focus of burgeoning scholarly attention. In fact F.'s is the latest in a spate of commentaries on the book to appear in about a generation: Paratore (1982), Gransden (1991), the "quasi-commentary," as F. calls it, by Alessio (1994), Horsfall (2003), and the Binders (2005). A little earlier is R. Woodrow's 1978 Oxford thesis, a commentary on the Camilla portion of the Book, which, though languishing unpublished, is not infrequently consulted and cited by scholars, F. among them. I dwell momentarily on Woodrow's thesis here to say that its consistent combination of literary sensitivity, scholarly discernment and lucid writing presents an exemplary counterfoil to some of its published successors, including the one under review here. F.'s commentary was initially his 2002 Fordham dissertation which, he says, took only a year from start to finish in a "maddened frenzy of work." Such conditions must be ominous for a scholarly commentary on complex and sophisticated poetry. If the frenzy did not entirely dissipate with consignment of the dissertation, that might be because of the rapidity and volume of other scholars' work on Aeneid 1 1 complicating preparations for publication. Certainly Horsfall's commentary had to change the conditions for the reception of another English commentary on the same book. F. acknowledges his diligent reading of Horsfall's work and confirms it regularly with a " pace Horsfall" mantra, but also with occasional notes of approbation. It is probably an exaggeration for him to say that he disagrees with H. on "on the majority of problems of Vergilius 55 (2009)</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 119 interpretation." From one perspective this commentary is a sort of detailed review of H.'s, a tangy alternative to some of the saccharine reviews of the latter. Criticisms of another commentator, though, do not always serve to elucidate the subject of the commentary. Perhaps it is only a coincidental symptom of frenzy, but F.'s writing shows a number of Horsfallesque habits such as the verb-less sentence. Such gratuitous pidginizing, always inelegant and often distracting, affords only dubious economies of space that could be realized in other ways. Another quirk shared by the two commentators is the use of Latin numerical adverbs, often with a parallel word or phrase in English in the same sentence (or sentence fragment) as in " Septies in the Aeneid (possibly eight ...) and once in GeorgicsT This affectation is ordinarily as harmless as it is pointless, but it can cause both linguistic and arithmetic confusion as in "The repetition of rex bis in three lines is striking." This refers to rege and regem at 11.15 and 17 where, pace F., only rex (not rex bis ) is repeated once, not twice. While the timing and scope of HorsfalPs commentary make it inevitable that it should loom large in its close successor, F.'s work is sui generis and must have assumed its distinctive flavor before Horsfall burst upon the scene. At the same time, in the best tradition of tralatitious commentary (Hardie' s term in the re-issue of the Conington-Nettleship commentary), F. shows himself quite conversant with his other predecessors from Servius on. The absence of a Latin text, and a list of sigla, is inconvenient, but F. keys his comments to Mynors' OCT and notes that Book 11 has comparatively few textual controversies. Still, there are occasions when he cites manuscript variants and/or disagrees with Mynors. In one of the rare instances where he discusses a crux I find his verdict and/or the reasons for it questionable. Specifically, at 830 he chooses either relinquit or reliquit (without specifying which) over other variants, arguing that it salvages a tricolon. Even if it does that, though, I do not see that effect over-riding the strong arguments of several predecessors in favor of relinquunt , the lectio difficilior. Sometimes F.'s textual notes are cryptic in their brevity as, for example, "Note cui P2 for sua ." at v. 118. Why is the reading cui to be noted? F. has just completed a paragraph on the interpretation of the verse with the vulgate reading sua but without mentioning any implications of what he considers a noteworthy variant.</page><page sequence="3">120 F. also foregoes a translation, regrettably in my opinion. A translation, as a parallel and complement to the annotations, can assist the user's comprehension of just what the commentator has in mind. F. has also dispensed with an introduction, referring us instead to the relevant Ch. in his monograph on the Aeneid, Madness Unchained (Norman, 2007). There the reader will indeed find anticipated, in more readable prose, much of the general thrust of the commentary. Still a commentary-specific introduction within the same covers would be a convenience. That, or an expanded preface, might help to orient his readers to the rationale for some of the unusual ingredients of his commentary such as his sporadic citations of the Old French Roman ď Eneas or of the Dry den translation and various others. Such poetic re- workings can often offer valuable insights where philological criticism falters, but it is often unclear that F.s citations fit that category; indeed Dryden is as often as not cited with disapproval. There are other respects in which the discipline of writing an introduction might have clarified things for us, and perhaps for F. himself who seems to need reminding that he is primarily commenting on Aeneid 11, not on its commentators. It is usually not helpful for the reading of Vergil to be plied with observations about the mood or attitude of a Horsfall or a Henry when addressing a given matter. Among accessories to the commentary that are provided is a bibliography which, being restricted to monographs (and selectively at that), is less useful than a list of works cited, particularly given F.'s habit of referring throughout to works (usually commentaries on other Latin authors) by the modern scholar's surname without title, date or place of publication. There is also an Index locorum and an Index rerum nominumque, both of limited reliability. They show no criteria of selection that would explain their many anomalies of which I cite the following token examples, all drawn from two successive pages. The paragraph on 264 (p. 95) contains the names of Diomedes, Neoptolemos, Achilles, Deidamia, Pyrrhus, Homer, Polites, Priam, Orestes and Andromache. Of these only Neoptolemos is indexed although Diomedes, Achilles and Homer are indexed for other passages. Granted, Neoptolemos is the principal subject of the note, but the principal subjects of the two notes on 265 that immediately follow, Idomeneus and the Locrians, go unindexed. Back in the note on 264, moreover, there are references to Ilias Parva, lby cus (= schol. on Eur. Hel.), a passage of Vergilius 55 (2009)</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 121 Pindar, two of Euripides and three of Vergil. Of these the Ilias Parva and the scholion/Ibycus fragment are not in the Index locorum. Then, in separate notes on the same page 95, two fragments of Hesiod (43a and 204 M-W) are cited but only one is indexed, while the names of Turnus, Deucalion and Bellerophon, also on page 95, are omitted from the other index. Elsewhere, place names such as Lycia and Tor Paterno are indexed while others, such as Spain, are not. A different sort of slip-up in the Index Locorum has the Homeric Hymn to Demeter listed under the name of Homer where few modern scholars would expect it. Were such anomalies rarer it might be niggling of a reviewer to dwell on them, but in their aggregate they are disturbingly suggestive of haste or indifference. The principal purpose of any literary commentary must be to facilitate and enhance others' reading of the work with exposition and argument by confirming or correcting earlier interpretations or suggesting and provoking new ones. F. employs a wide range of materials and creative initiatives to serve such a broad mandate. He is particularly adept at bringing to attention the poet's use of rhetorical devices, sound effects (assonance, alliteration, spondaic lines), verbal repetitions that he sees as closing a narrative or thematic "ring," also special lexical applications such as the frequent use of the "key word" maestus (anticipated, I note, by Binder's comment at 1 1.26 on the same Schlüsselwort). Stylistic observations are of course de rigueur in Vergilian commentary, but F. is often alert to instances traditionally overlooked by other commentators whom he occasionally chides for being "asleep" (one of his less acerbic criticisms). Sometimes, though, F.'s wide-ranging historical and cultural interests, abetted perhaps by a drive for originality, might lead him beyond the Vergilian commentator's proper purlieu. A salient instance is a half-page expatiation on the medieval and modern cult of the Archangel Michael at Monte San Angelo . This is triggered by Vergil's reference to the same mountain, then Garganus (11.247), but otherwise the note has nothing that elucidates the Vergilian passage. However intrinsically interesting it might be, I would gladly sacrifice it for a few more verbs in the commentary. The same goes for a disquisition on the comparison of Camilla to a hawk or falcon, accipiter. This note, potentially helpful on some points, is flawed by inaccuracy. F. writes of "what modern taxonimists [sic] call the Accipiter family, a hunting species ..." A</page><page sequence="5">122 taxonomie family is not a species and Accipiter , a genus, is neither a family nor a species. Another instance of gratuitous and possibly erroneous commentary is the statement that sparus (682) is etymologically cognate with English spear. Appreciation of Vergil might not be affected by such things, but confidence in the commentator is. In F.'s commentary, Camilla commands a position of prominence commensurate with her importance in the Book. F recognizes anticipations of this major figure not only earlier in Book 11, but in earlier books of the poem as well (although he has surprisingly little to say about her closing appearance in Book 7). I commend the energy and imagination with which F. explores new, neglected or previously denied possibilities for the significance of Camilla. Welcome, for instance, is his assertion of a likely connection (albeit unelaborated) with her historical namesake M. Furius Camillus. Also welcome, though vague in specifics, is his provocative association of Arruns' name with various like-named public figures of the late Republic or early Principáte. Such matters remain speculative, but plausible and worth further consideration. In other cases, however, imaginative hypotheses would have been better jettisoned after due reflection. One of these would associate Camilla with Hermes/Mercury Psychopompus because the name Ca(s)millus, according to ancient authorities, designated Mercury in Etruscan and, says F., Camilla leads Turnus to his death. This overextends in two directions; there is no evidence that the Etruscan god had a psychopompic function and, whatever agency Camilla might have had in Turnus' death can only be contrived most awkwardly as the guidance of his soul. Another disposable suggestion involves a possible concatenation of Cicero, Drances and Camilla: Cicero is reflected in the orator Drances, the Drances episode is soon followed by the Camilla episode, and Camilla and Cicero both have Volscian origins. This, I fear, just will not work up into anything of poetic significance. It is, in any case, presented as a query, apparently en passant . There is, though, another figment on which F. dwells repeatedly and deliberately, after propounding it in at least two earlier publications. It is F.'s conviction that Camilla not only has "lupine" characteristics but that she is a "lycanthrope," a were-wolf. He does not offer any definition of his own concept of "lycanthropy," but he is apparently thinking, not of something psychological, but of the lycanthropy of popular tradition which involves physical transformation between Vergilius 55 (2009)</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 123 humans and wolves, as it does in another Vergilian context (Eel. 8.95- 100) that F., curiously, does not cite. At one point, by referring to Camilla's "anthropomorphism," F. might suggest that she is a wolf in human form, but that is an inference that the reader must draw. He also refers to Italian folklore's contribution to Vergil's delineation of Camilla as lycanthrope, but cites not a single parallel, ancient or modern, nor any of the copious secondary bibliography on lycanthropy in support or clarification of his convictions. It is possible, though, that "Italian folklore" refers to the lupine features of the cult myth of Apollo on Mt. Soracte with which Servius links Camilla's slayer Arruns. That myth involves wolves and the adoption by humans of wolf-like stealthiness as a means of averting pestilence, but it involves nothing like the metamorphosis of classic lycanthropy. The removal of pestilence (not a were-wolf) in the form of Camilla, whom Arruns calls a pes I is (792), would in fact seem to underlie Vergil's allusion to the wolf myth of Soracte. Woodrow made this point nicely, but F. passes over it. All in all I am unable to extract a coherent argument from F.'s assertions about Camilla's lycanthropy, even with the aid of his earlier presentations on the same matter in Madness Unchained (349-351) and in Athenaeum 95 (2007) 271-286. I have no confidence that his claims can be substantiated. Certainly no number of published reiterations can accomplish that without clearer definitions, additional data and closer argument. A measure of the investigative labor that F. has devoted to the Camilla narrative is provided by an extensive bibliographical note of almost two small-print pages with which he prefaces his comments on the episode. This valuable supplement and complement to bibliographies in Enciclopedia Vergiliana by Arrigoni (not listed by F.) and Canciani will put future scholars in F.'s debt, even though it cites mainly periodical literature to the virtual exclusion of Ch.s in monographs, entries in reference works and most earlier commentaries. It is also flawed by apparent haste and carelessness. Of two articles by Capdeville, both dated 1992 and having identical titles, F. enters the shorter version from a set of conference proceedings and ignores the longer, annotated, one published in MEFRA. There is a cautionary inter alia at the beginning of the bibliography but, towards the end, a seemingly contradictory claim to completeness that explicitly admits even items which F. considers to lack in merit. Unexplained, then, is his omission of</page><page sequence="7">124 this reviewer's article on Camilla's name that appeared in this journal: Vergilius 29 (1983) 19-26. For completeness, and other reasons, he might also have included Horsfall's "Arctinus, Virgil and Quintus Smyrnaeus" in Hommages á J. Poucet (Louvain 2004) 73-80. Another anomaly of the bibliography is the abandonment of chronological order part way through. Notwithstanding the negative observations that dominate this review, F. does demonstrate considerable literary sensitivity, a broad and venturesome intellectual curiosity and a good familiarity with the apparatus of classical philology and Vergilian criticism. I have found several of his observations informative or stimulating in their originality. Serious students of Book 1 1 will certainly want to consult this book. The sad fact remains, though, that it has been published prematurely, with far too many symptoms of a recklessness unworthy of the capabilities of author and editors - unworthy, too, and inconsiderate of the individuals and institutions who purchase the volume. The mistakes and infelicities cited above are only representative of a larger aggregate. We must await the appearance of F.'s announced commentary on Aeneid 5 with the hope, indeed the demand, that it reflects a more diligent, disciplined, spondaic mode of production than the present volume does.
