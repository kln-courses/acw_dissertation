<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Adventures of The Cunning Little Vixen: Leos Jan?cek, Max Brod and their Predecessors GEOFFREY CHEW Royal Holloway, University of London I The image of the composer Leos Jan?cek as an unruly genius whose wild ideas sometimes needed taming is an old one; and to some extent his faithful admirer and translator, Max Brod, is to blame, even if Jan?cek himself began by enthusiastically accepting Brod's help. Brod's relationship with Jan?cek, and his understanding of the relation between words and music in Jan?cek's works, in fact depended on complicated issues of personality, aesthetics, religion and politics. I would like to illustrate these here through focusing on the work in which Brod's Earnings' of Jan?cek reached their peak in 1925, Pf?hody liiky Bystroufky [The Cunning Little Vixen, 'The Adventures of Vixen Sharpears', 1922-23]; and to do this adequately, the genesis of the libretto ofthat opera, in its various earlier versions, will need to be revisited, as well as Brod's own intellectual development in the 1920s. Much of the material to be quoted is well known in general, but the interpretations offered here are new in a number of respects and will help, I hope, to clarify some aspects of the relationship between words and music in The Cunning Little Vixen (and not only in Brod's version of it) that may still seem puzzling. As is well known, Brod spoke and read Czech, and his engagement with the composer had begun with his translation of the libretto of Jenufa (Jeji pastorkyna) in 1916-17.1 Introduced to Jan?cek 's music by Josef Suk, Dvof?k's 1 For substantial recent accounts of the relationship between Jan?cek and Brod, see Chapter 8 ('Max Brod, Friend and Meddler') in John Tyrrell, Jan?fek.

An Examination of Max Brod's Performing Versions of the Works of Leos Jan?cek' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Newcastle, Australia, 2003). I am grateful to Dr Ernst for making a copy of his dissertation available to me. Earlier discussions include Charles Susskind, Jan??ek arid Brod (New Haven, CT, 1985), and influential contributions from Milan Kundera, notably in his Les testaments trahis.

But Brod had a sense that Jan?cek 's taste and judgment were not always infallible, at least in the impression his works were likely to make on audiences in the German-speaking sphere. So a pattern of intervention as well as assistance began to emerge in his translations of Jan?cek's texts, from Kata Kabanov? (1921-22) onwards, with Brod increasingly rationalizing elements in them. Such intervention reached its peak in the text for the Vixen, referred to by both Brod and Jan?cek in letters as an Umdichtung [recomposition] rather than an ?bersetzung [translation].3 Subsequently, it may have been Jan?cek's increasing fame that enabled the composer, with the support of his publishers, Universal Edition, to resist further sweeping changes proposed by Brod for the translation of the text of The Makropulos Case (1926), with Brod retreating to a more conservative and cautious line, though he continued to act as Jan?cek's translator. II Although Brod arguably failed to grasp important aspects of Jan?cek's aesthetic, an issue to which we shall return, in the case of The Cunning Little Vixen there are substantial intrinsic peculiarities, if not problems, which are largely to do with its genre. As Susskind points out, the relatively familiar operatic generic features of the plots of Jenufa and Kata Kabanov?, especially that of the latter, with a heroine doomed to die tragically at the end, are dropped in favour of a series of 'nine dreamy episodes [that] follow no particular logic' and have 'perplexed all listeners (beginning with Brod) whose thinking tends to be [...] "linear" \4 But this episodic structure, though new in Jan?cek's output, was not his invention. It derives both from the novel on which the opera is based, Rudolf T?snohl?dek's Lifka Bystrouika (1921), which was originally serialized in the Brno newspaper Lidov? noviny, and from an earlier source yet, a series of 2 The book was published first in Czech translation (Max Brod, Leos"Jan?tek. ?ivot a d?lo [Prague, 1924]), and the original German version was published the following year. 3 See Ernst, ' "Durch kleine Ritze nimmt man Abgr?nde wahr" ', p. 233. Jan?cek uses the term in writing to Emil Hertzka of Universal Edition, 22 June 1925: 'ich m?chte [...] vor dem Druck gern seine "Umdichtung" lesen' [I would like to read his 'recomposition' before it goes into print]. Leos Jan?cek, Briefe an die Universal Edition, ed. by Ernst Hilmar (Tutzing, 1988), p. 237. 4 Susskind, Jan?tek and Brod, p. 71. Jan?cek intended at one point to drop the division of the opera into acts and instead use named scenes, but though names for scenes remained, he finally settled on a compromise three-act structure. Michael Ewans argues against the opera having an episodic structure at all (Michael Ewans, Janatek 's Tragic Operas [London, 1977], p. 138), but only because the episodes come in a notionally chronological order.</page><page sequence="3">The Adventures of The Cunning Little Vixen 115 more than 200 black-and-white drawings by the genre painter Stanislav Lolek (1873-1936).5 The status of these pictures and their connection with Tesnohlidek's novel were explained to the Brno public later by Bohumil Markalous, who had been the arts editor of the newspaper and had felt the need of a pictorial feature for it.6 Visiting Prague, by chance he discovered a portfolio of comic drawings of a fox in Lolek's studio, and persuaded the artist to let him take them to Brno as the basis of a serialized feature which he thought might be in the style of Wilhelm Busch's Hans Huckebein, der Ungl?cksrabe [Hans Huckebein, the Bird of III-Omen], also first published in serial form more than halfa century earlier.7 Busch 's concise rhyming couplets, each accompanied by a drawing, tell of the escapades of a crow, captured as a chick and taken home by a small boy, that wreaks havoc in his aunt's old-fashioned domestic establishment until it hangs itself in her knitting; there is much amoral comic Schadenfreude before the sudden tongue-in-cheek, matter-of-fact 'moral' of the final couplet: '"Die Bosheit war sein Hauptpl?sier, | Drum", spricht die Tante, "h?ngt er hier!'" ['Mischief was his main diversion', his aunt proclaims, 'that's why he's hanging here now!']. With this in mind, the general editor of Lidov? noviny, Arnost Heinrich, asked T?snohlidek, a member of the editorial staff at the time, to create a 'Buschiade' by writing verses to accompany Lolek's drawings; the intended genre (a comic versified account of unrelated episodes of catastrophic mischief-making) was clear. T?snohlidek agreed, but was permitted in the event to expand the narrative into continuous prose, which allowed him much more freedom in reinterpreting the drawings. Although the original purpose of Lolek's drawings remains unclear, they were well suited to this new use, and their narrative thrust is not difficult to follow. Groups of drawings tell brief, self-contained stories illustrating the behaviour of a fox and other wild forest animals, which are lightly anthropomorphized with unsentimental and gently comic attributes. And traces remain of Lolek's conception in all later versions. To illustrate the relationship between the versions, it may be worth tracing one of the episodes in detail through them. To this end, I shall select the episode that became the first scene of Act II ? one of the more problematic 5 The drawings are all reproduced in the Prague National Theatre production booklet, Leo?Jan?tek: PHhody liiky BystrouSky, ed. by Pavel Petr?n?k (Prague, 2002). 6 Markalous's first-hand account, published under his pen name, Jaromir John, was written in collaboration with Josef Rejsek and published in the Divadelni list N?rodmho divadla Bm? of 5 May 1948; my account of it above is quoted from Jaroslav Vogel, Leo?

This is based on the thirteen successive pictures reproduced here from Lolek's originals, which depict a fox or vixen expelling a badger from its sett by fouling it. They alternate unstably between naturalistic observation and anthropomorphism. The first three pictures launch the narrative, with the fox and badger both reacting to a shower of rain ? the badger emerging (picture 2), retreating (3), and thus drawing the attention of the fox to the sett. Next, the animals are shown with human attributes: the badger contentedly smokes a long pipe (4) and repels the intruder with a whip (5), and the fox creates a scene with melodramatic human gestures (6). Anthropomorphism is abandoned, with the fox spraying the sett with a few drops of urine (7), the badger reacting strongly (8), and the fox then fouling the sett with a deluge of urine (9-10), but it returns, with the badger (pipe in hand) spitting disgustedly (11), and leaving the sett with pipe and rolled-up mat (12), watched from a distance by the fox. Finally the fox is installed in the sett (13). Tesnohlidek brings his version of Lolek's narrative up to date for the readers of the newspaper, and links successive episodes as clearly as possible within a single coherent narrative, while admittedly paying little attention to literary quality ? this novel is Trivialliteratur, though a model of its type.8 The fox becomes unambiguously female, a lively, irreverent vixen. She thereby invites self-identification from the implicit readership, young, well-off, unmarried bourgeois girls from 1920s Brno, with an eye to modern fashion, sex and the marriage market; the author compliments them backhandedly at the end of the novel as his 'mii? cten?rky' [dear female readers].9 For comic effect, the authorial voice is that of a slightly racy 'uncle', or at any rate an older man. As Jan?cek remarked in a letter, this is a d?vli rom?n, a girls' novel,10 though very remote from either Little Women or the Disney tradition that has sometimes 8 See, for example, Milan Kundera's comment, 'oeuvre charmante mais sans grandes ambi tions artistiques' [a charming book but without any great literary ambition], in his article, 'Le plus nostalgique des op?ras', here quoted from Leo?Jan?iek.

For the parents of the girls, there is some sly political satire: the novel, basically sympathetic to the democratic ideals of the new First Czechoslovak Republic, pokes fun at anarchism and Bolshevism, both voguish at the time. But the author goes further, modelling forest society on the new democracy while implying throughout that both are anarchically uncontrollable. (This is an aspect that was understandably glossed over during the years of communism in Czechoslovakia, even though the authorities never once withdrew the novel from print.) So the frog in Chapter 2 is a Bolshevist, who enthusiastically but laughably explains that the Party does not permit dissidence because it is strictly controlled (in the opera, this nuance was abandoned); the episode in the henhouse (Chapter 5, later a scene in Act I of the opera) has the vixen preaching communist egalitarianism to the hens from patently self-seeking motives. The episode with the badger (Chapter 6) similarly becomes a satire of the Bolshevist expropriation of feudal property (as it remained for Jan?cek). Consequently, anthropomorphism is taken further in this chapter than in the Lolek illustrations, even in an episode like this one, where vulgarity can hardly be avoided when human attributes are bolted on to the fouling of a badger's sett. The essential motivation for the scene becomes not the passing shower of rain, though this is mentioned, but the need of the homeless vixen, immediately after she has escaped from the farmyard, to find a place to live in a mysterious forest which makes every wanderer afraid, even though courting couples in the forest, adds Tesnohlidek archly for his readers, might be afraid only of being spied on. The badger is also transformed, becoming an elderly property-owner physi cally resembling Emperor Franz Joseph I, with an unhappy love affair behind him, and with laughable social pretensions recalling the obsolete feudalism of the pre-war Austro-Hungarian aristocracy: [B]yl to milostp?n jezevec, dom?c? p?n, ml?denec obstarozn? a byvaly c?sarsky rada lesni risi [...]. Ac ?rade neslouzil a samot?fsky soukromnicil, zachoval si podle rodinn? tradice licousy, jez jeho tv?fi dod?valy zd?n? slechtick?ho.11 [It was Sir (literally gn?diger Herr) Badger, lord of his household, an elderly bachelor and a former imperial councillor in the empire of the forest. Though he did not work in an office and lived alone on private means, he kept up his side-whiskers in accordance with family tradition, and these gave his face the semblance of an aristocrat's.] The episode is constructed skilfully to build up a quasi-human justification for the expulsion of the badger by the vixen, even though Lolek's drawings do not suggest dependence on anything other than normal animal behaviour. First a shouting match develops, with the vixen using almost impenetrable 11 T?snohl?dek, LiZka Bystroufka, p. 47.</page><page sequence="8">120 Geoffrey Chew Brno dialect and the badger speaking with an affected lisp. (Throughout this book T?snohlidek projects registers of speech for comic effect, as he does in other works, including both his fiction and the regular reports he wrote for Lidov? noviny about court cases involving people from the lower orders of society brought before the Brno magistrate.12 These registers are generally maintained by Jan?cek in the opera, though the lisp disappears.) In this fracas the vixen's rude behaviour is comically ascribed to her bad upbringing, in which she had 'navykla si sprostym nectnostem lidskym' [become accustomed to vulgar, foul human habits]; variants of this joke appear several times in the book. Nevertheless, the noise draws a crowd of neighbouring forest birds and animals, making hostile allegations ? that the badger had been profiteering during World War I and that he had subjected a poor, defenceless woman to a beating merely for standing outside his house. However, the deluge of urine that clinches the vixen's victory over the badger comes not as a result of this uproar, but is another joke, when the vixen's attractions encourage the badger to consider settling down in marriage: 'Coz aby ses tak ozenil', prohodil mimod?k jezevec [...]. 'N?co tak p?kn?ho zensk?ho by prece neskodilo.' 'Tebe by zrovna n?kdo chc?T, ozvalo se vysm?sn? nad jeho hlavou. 'Jak ses kapse klust?, tak ses hl?p? h?f nez bot. Tadyk m?s n?co zensk?ho, abys v?d?l, ze su uznal?.' Zkoprn?l, a nez se vzpamatoval ?zasu, byl mokry od hlavy az k pat?. Za nejv?tsich lij?k? se mu n?co takov?ho neprihodilo.13 ['What about my getting married', remarked the badger involuntarily. 'Something so nice and feminine wouldn't hurt, after all.' 'Someone might almost fancy you', came the taunting answer above his head. 'You're as stupid as your pockets are bulging, and worse than an old boot. Here's something feminine from me, so that you'll know how considerate I am.' He stood aghast, and before he could say Jack Robinson, he was wet from head to toe. Even in the most torrential downpours nothing of the sort had ever happened to him.] Ill No doubt the novel was a highly improbable subject for an opera ? T?snohlidek at first thought he was the subject of a practical joke when the rumour began to circulate in Brno that Jan?cek was intending to use it14 ? but Jan?cek 's conception of the work was very different from his model. Some of the farcical turns of events in the episodes of the original remain. But T?snohlidek 's interpretation of Lolek's drawings in terms of modern society is expanded into 12 Selections of these 'soudnicky' [court-room reports] are published in Rudolf Tesnohlidek, Mrtvy u kf?ie a jin? soudnifky, ed. by Miroslav Herman (Ostrava, I971)? and Rudolf Tesnohlidek, Surovost n?inosti a jin? soudni?ky, ed. by Bohumil Svozil (Prague, 1982). 13 Tesnohlidek, Liika BystrouSka, p. 52. 14 Tesnohlidek in Lidov? noviny, 3 July 1924.</page><page sequence="9">The Adventures of The Cunning Little Vixen 121 a larger vision of humanity, where the vixen's escapades become the misdeeds, without lasting negative significance, that are perpetrated by a 'prosty lid' [simple populace] that is nevertheless also 'capable of noble thoughts'.15 They become guarantees of authenticity, of humanity, in those who commit them. This quite alters the tenor of the work, and is arguably at the heart of its enduring appeal. Furthermore, Jan?cek's approach to the text works to some extent against the structure of T?snohl?dek's narrative, where each episode is constructed as a large-scale joke. According to his usual practice, Jan?cek drew literally on lines from the novel, both direct speech and third-person narrative, and reduced the number of words to an absolute minimum, even at the expense of the coherence, motivation and logic of the dialogue. Though this seems to indicate slavish conformity to the original, in practice it defamiliarizes it and deprives it of realism. In the first scene of Act I, for example, as I have noted elsewhere, the dialogue is fragmented and allocated to children's voices, so that it lacks the motivation and political awareness it possesses in the novel, and the music confers on the scene a solemnly ceremonious, though also ominous, dance-like atmosphere, as the listeners' first introduction to the atmosphere of the forest, which is very far from farcical.16 In the badger scene we have been considering, the final exchange between vixen and badger (at the fouling of the sett) becomes very strange. First, 'Tu m?s n?co zenskyho, abys v?d?l, it su uznal?' [Here's something feminine for you, so that you'll know how considerate I am], from the vixen, comes out of the blue rather than being a reply to the badger; so, if understood in terms of normal logic, it is motivated by vulgarity rather than wit. It is followed by 'O, jak jsem mravn? rozhorcen! Opustim nevd?cn? st?do' [Oh, how morally indignant I am! I shall abandon this ungrateful herd!] from the badger. These words, especially 'mravn?' [morally], are out of character even with the pomposity of the badger, because they are drawn from a tongue-in-cheek authorial third person comment in the novel: 'Div ho mrtvice hn?vu spravedliv?m neranila. Hluboce mravn? rozhorcen povstal' [it was a wonder he did not have heart failure in his righteous wrath. He rose in deep moral indignation].17 But this technique, of ending a scene with third-person narration converted into first-person speech, though contradicting realism, works rather like a 15 Jan?cek, letter to Max Brod, 11 March 1923: 'prosty lid b?fe zio ne jak v?cnou pf?hanu. [...] I moje liska Bystrouska je takovou: kradla, rdousila, ale vedle toho je zase schopn? c?ten? uslechtilych' [The simple populace accepts evil, and not as a lasting stigma. My vixen Bystrouska is like that too: she stole, she throttled (chickens), but besides that she is also capable of noble feelings].

It is found again in the final scene of the opera, in a more radical way yet: the third-person narration (from Tesnohlidek's Chapter 17), which is put into the forester's mouth in the opera, leads him to abandon his usual dialect for literary Czech, allowing an ecstatic mood, otherwise alien to the forester's persona, to be articulated, in which he sings of rusalky [water nymphs] weeping for joy, and mankind understanding that a supernatural happiness has passed its way, before the final orchestral apotheosis. The passage, beginning 'Jak je les divukr?sny!' [How exquisite the forest is!] immediately features the distinctly bookish word 'divukr?sny', 'exquisite', and is drawn directly from T?snohl?dek's passage, beginning 'Kterak byl nyn? les divukr?sny!' [How exquisite the forest now was!].18 In such cases, the sung text is defamiliarized, in a way that was unprecedented in Jan?cek's work up to that time, and to that extent it renders the narrative surreal, in style if not in content, rather than carrying the plot forward.19 As Milan Kundera has written, the music takes its place in controlling the narrative: Si on les [the two operas, The Cunning Little Vixen and From the House of the Dead, which Kundera regards as a pair] repr?sentait sans musique, les livrets s'av?reraient plut?t nuls; nuls parce que, d?s leur conception, Jan?cek r?serve le r?le dominant ? la musique; c'est elle qui raconte, qui d?voile la psychologie des personnages, qui ?meut, qui surprend, qui m?dite, qui envo?te et, m?me, qui organise l'ensemble et d?termine l'architecture (d'ailleurs tr?s travaill?e et tr?s raffin?e) de l'oeuvre.20 18 Ibid., p. 131; Jan?cek, The Cunning Little Vixen, Act III, from 4 bars before rehearsal no. 52 to 3 bars after rehearsal no. 54. 19 Though there is no space here to expand on this point, Jan?cek's literalism in mining his sources for text is arguably a very important aspect of his late operas: it forces the attentive listener to take them as intertextual commentaries on their models. This notionally sets up their models (unlike, say, Shakespeare's Othello when used as the basis for Verdi's Otello) as works that ideally should not be left out of account in interpreting them, and makes them, according to Peter Petersen's definition, Literaturopern: 'Der Terminus "Literaturoper" bezeichnet eine Sonderform des Musiktheaters, bei der das Libretto auf einem bereits vorliegenden literarischen Text (Drama, Erz?hlung) basiert, dessen sprachliche, semantische und ?sthetische Struktur in einen musikalisch-dramatischen Text (Opernpartitur) eingeht und dort als Strukturschicht kenntlich bleibt' [The term 'Literaturoper' refers to a particular form of music theatre in which the libretto is based on a pre-existing literary text (drama or narrative), whose linguistic, semantic and aesthetic structure is adopted in a musical and dramatic text (an operatic score), and remains recognizable as a structural level within it]: Peter Petersen, 'Der Terminus "Literaturoper" ? eine Begriffsbestimmung', Archiv ?ir Musikwissenschaft, 56 (1999), 52-70 (p. 60). I have discussed Petersen's article (among other things) in relation to Jan?cek, though not specifically to The Cunning Little Vixen, in ' "Literaturoper": A Term Still in Search of a Definition', the introduction to the special number Jan?tek and the Literaturoper of Sbornik praci Filozoflck? fakulty Brn?nsk? univerzity, H 42-43 (2007-08), 5-13. 20 Kundera, 'Le plus nostalgique des op?ras', p. 40.</page><page sequence="11">The Adventures of The Cunning Little Vixen 123 [If The Cunning Little Vixen and From the House of the Dead were staged without music, their libretti would seem rather pointless, for, from the moment that he conceived the operas, Jan?cek gave the leading role to music. It is the music that narrates, that reveals the psychology of the characters, that constructs emotion, surprises, meditates, enchants, and organizes the whole piece and constructs its architecture, which is, moreover, very well wrought and refined.] The music is also in a style new for Jan?cek, who, not for the first time in his life, rethinks his musical language. John Tyrrell has pointed out that The Cunning Little Vixen may represent Jan?cek's adoption of traits of the music of Debussy; Jan?cek had only recently (1921) become acquainted with La Mer [The Sea] and Pell?as et M?lisande.21 The opera has unfortunately not yet been thoroughly analysed in these terms, and it would be out of place to attempt to do so here, but it is no doubt significant that the scene with the badger begins with an extended, static whole-tone passage, perhaps suggested by Debussy's music ? although very different from it, and drawing on a method of handling motivic material, already well established in Jan?cek's output, whose subtlety goes well beyond anything that needs to be said here.22 A melodic motif (first appearing as Ex. ia) is heard in various forms through the scene and permeates it; the initial non-tonal passage in which it is first heard may possibly be intended to represent the mysterious, forbidding forest depths into which the vixen is cast once she has escaped from the captivity of Act 1.23 21 Tyrrell, Jan??ek. Years of a Life, n, 317. Though it has been suggested that Jan?cek 'probably' encountered Debussy's music as early as 191 o, when La Mer was performed in Prague by the Czech Philharmonic on 30 January (see Milos Stedro?, Leos*Jan??ek a hudba 20. stolet? [Jan??ek and 20th-century Music] [Brno, 1998], p. 82, quoting earlier literature), there is no evidence that Jan?cek attended this or other early performances. Some years later, there is a brief quotation from Debussy's F?tes galantes in Jan?cek's harmony manual of 1919 (Leos Jan?cek, Hudebn? teoretick? d?lo, vol. 2, ed. by Zden?k Blazek [Prague, 1974], p. 317). His interest in Debussy is very well documented from 1921 in an analysis he made that year of'Jeux de vagues' from La Mer (Brno, Jan?cek Archive of the Moravian Museum, MS S 64, published in facsimile in Milos Stedro?, 'Jan?cek, verismus a impresionismus' [Jan?cek, verismo and impressionism], ?asopis Moravsk?ho musea / Acta musei Moraviae, v?dy spole?ensk?, 53-54 [1968-69], 125-54, and again with commentary in Stedro?, LeoiJan??ek a hudba 20. stolet?, pp. 82-86). For a detailed study of Jan?cek's analysis, including comparisons with other twentieth-century analyses of Debussy, and the suggestion that the composer made the study as an aid to his composition of Dunaj [The Danube] (1923-25?), see Paul Wingfield, 'Jan?cek, Musical Analysis, and Debussy's "Jeux de vagues" ', in Jan??ek Studies, ed. by Paul Wingfield (Cambridge, 1999), pp. 183-280 (for the Dunaj suggestion, p. 207). 22 On the complexity of Jan?cek's motivic technique, see the useful discussion in Wingfield, 'Jan?cek, Musical Analysis, and Debussy's "Jeux de vagues" ', pp. 237-46.

This is further emphasized in this scene by Jan?cek's use of the chorus: the lesni hav?t' [Waldgetier, forest animals, insects and birds] is given a voice very different from that of the noisy neighbours who suddenly intrude in Tesnohlidek's version. Jan?cek's lesni hav?t' is present from the outset, watching the incident and making continual threatening comments, as a revolutionary rabble supporting the vixen and demanding vengeance against the badger.24 Their unsettling effect is very similar to that of the prisoners who intervene towards the end of Act II of From the House of the Dead, who are incensed when Gorjancikov dares to drink tea and thereby displays his superior social status, and who finally resort to extreme violence. IV Faced with a work so different from its predecessors, Max Brod was clearly nonplussed when Jan?cek first put his plans for the Vixen to him in March 1923.25 However, it would seem likely that some of the principal themes 24 The BBC's animated version of the opera brought this aspect out visually too, in an outstanding way, with pairs of eyes everywhere scrutinizing the action, throughout the opera (The Cunning Little Vixen. The Animated Film ofJan?fek's Opera, DVD OA 0839 D, London, 2003). 25 Brod, letter to Jan?cek, 23 March 1923: 'ich habe Ihren Text gelesen. Offen gestanden mutet er mich sehr fremd an. Ich kann noch gar kein inneres Verh?ltnis dazu gewinnen, vielleicht deshalb, weil ich Tiere so wenig kenne' [I have read your text. To be frank it seems very strange to me. I cannot yet relate inwardly to it at all, perhaps because I understand animals so little].

Christentum ? Judentum [Paganism ? Christianity ?Judaism].26 This book seems essentially to represent a reaction to the First World War: Brod's acute awareness of the unnecessary suffering caused by the war had led him to think carefully about the nature of suffering and the role of religion in dealing with it, and radically to reformulate his own Judaism as a programme for living. To do so, he draws a fundamental distinction in the book between 'edles' and 'unedles Ungl?ck', 'noble' and 'ignoble' misfortune respectively. 'Edles Ungl?ck' is ontological, the misfortune that is the lot of human beings because they are human with human limitations, inescapably subject to their God-given attributes, which include aging and death, and are driven primarily by passion (particularly sexual passion): Motor des edlen Ungl?cks ist die Leidenschaft. Deshalb ist die Sexualit?t das zentrale Gebiet, der Mittelpunkt des edlen Ungl?cks. Von allen Boten Gottes spricht Eros am eindringlichsten. Er rei?t den Menschen am schnellsten vor das Angesicht der Herrlichkeit Gottes, er stellt ihn in seiner Kleinheit dem Unendlichen gegen?ber, l??t sch?rfstes Reinheitslicht auf ihn fallen und weist ihm die h??lichen Flecken seines heuchlerischen Tugendmantels.27 [The driving force of noble misfortune is passion, and so sexuality is the central focus of noble misfortune. Eros is the messenger of God who speaks the most insistently and is quickest to wrench human beings into the presence of God's glory, juxtaposing their puniness to the infinite, casting the most unforgivingly pure light on them, and exposing the ugly stains on the veil of their hypocrisy.] Such 'noble misfortune', 'edles Ungl?ck', requires humility and acquiescence as the only truly appropriate responses. But, by contrast, such attitudes are wholly inappropriate for 'unedles Ungl?ck', the 'ignoble' misfortune that could always have been averted if forethought had been given and care taken. Much of the suffering caused by the war had been 'ignoble'; and ignoble misfortune, paralysing the senses, deserves no acquiescence: [Die] Indulgenz gegen?ber dem unedlen Ungl?ck ist ebenso frevelhaft wie die Insolenz gegen?ber dem edlen Ungl?ck. [...] [Heute glauben] viele, die sich besonders tief d?nken, im Krieg eine der Menschheit gleichsam angeborene Gei?el sehen zu d?rfen. [...] Wirklich? Wir werden ja sehen! 26 Max Brod, Heidentum ? Christentum ?Judentum. Ein Bekenntnisbuch, 2 vols (Munich, 1921). 27 Ibid., , 34. Kundera characterizes Brod as afraid of sexuality, in his discussion of Brod's relationship to Franz Kafka ? especially in Brod's censorship of some of the more explicit passages in Kafka's diaries when editing them. See Kundera, Les testaments trahis, part 2 (T'ombre castratrice de Saint Garta', especially p. 57; Testaments Betrayed, p. 42). This seems just as misconceived as Brod's meddling.</page><page sequence="14">126 Geoffrey Chew [...] Mir gen?gt schon heute mein Gef?hl der Entr?stung, um den Krieg als unedles Ungl?ck zu agnoszieren. [...] Bei unedlem Ungl?ck ermattet die Phantasie, das Mitleid kann nicht mehr mit. Ich kann mir die Todesqualen eines Verwundeten im Drahtverhau vorstellen, ich kann schlaflose N?chte lang an die Sommeschlacht denken, ? aber zwei Tote oder siebzigtausend Tote in dieser Schlacht, das ergibt keinen Unterschied mehr. Es ist so, als weigere sich die Phantasie, in dieses faktisch zwar Geschehende, jedoch immanent Unnotwendige einzudringen.28 [Acquiescence in the face of ignoble misfortune is just as sacrilegious as hubris in the face of noble misfortune. Today there are many who imagine themselves especially profound in regarding war as an innate scourge of humanity. Really? We'll see! My sense of indignation today is enough to make me reject war as ignoble misfortune. The imagination is dulled by ignoble misfortune: sympathy dries up. I can imagine the death throes of a wounded soldier caught in barbed wire, I can lie awake all night thinking about the battle of the Somme, but to distinguish between two deaths and 70,000 deaths in that battle becomes impossible. It is as if the imagination refuses to explore such things, which though happening in fact are immanently unnecessary.] Then he distinguishes the religions of the Western world (explicitly leaving aside the religions of Asia and Africa) under three main headings, paganism, Christianity and Judaism. They are distinguished by their differing attitudes to the relationship between this world and the hereafter, with paganism in principle affirming only this world, Christianity in principle affirming only the hereafter, and Judaism able, rightly understood, to steer a middle course. He defines paganism as the religion of warmongering and nationalism (and includes 'Hakenkreuzleute' [Nazis, literally Swastika people] as well as Marxists, under this heading29) and sees it, even in 1921, as the current most likely to dominate Europe's future. He thinks that Christianity, essentially because of its doctrines of original sin and the justification of sinners through substitutionary atonement, cannot adequately distinguish between noble and ignoble misfortune (not only because this has been demonstrated by the glorification of the war in 'millions' of ecclesiastical rites and ceremonies), and is too often unhappily wedded with modern paganism. Judaism, then, though standing aside as a wallflower, has much potentially to offer the West. In The Cunning Little Vixen, it may be 'edles Ungl?ck' in Brod's sense that colours the autumnal 'sad ending' referred to by Jan?cek,30 with the forester accepting the inevitability of old age and death, and the renewal of nature.31 28 Brod, Heidentum ?

Christentum ?</page><page sequence="15">The Adventures of The Cunning Little Vixen 127 This is a new theme in Jan?cek's output, and is far from T?snohl?dek's conception, in which the forester's old age is only a passing episode, and which concludes with a conventional happy ending, the marriage of fox and vixen. This celebration of 'edles Ungl?ck' must have appealed enormously to Brod; but at the same time he must have been dismayed by the fact that it seemed underplayed and undermined by Jan?cek's odd new approach to his text, and, as I shall suggest below, it seems to have occurred to him that the opera could speak more clearly about 'edles Ungl?ck' if he edited it a little. Most famously, he objected to the appearance, at the end of the opera, of the grandson of the original frog, as an inappropriate intrusion into a moment of exaltation, where he would have preferred the forester to exclaim, 'So kehret alles zur?ck, alles in ewiger Jugendpracht!' [Thus everything comes around once more, everything, in the eternal splendour of youth!],32 although this would have been tame compared with the defamiliarized third-person speech the forester in fact uses (already mentioned above). Jan?cek understandably resisted this suggestion, pointing out that the music alone says all that needs saying; but merely to quote Brod's proposal shows the gap between the aesthetic of the two men. It shows Brod's inability to grasp the originality of what Jan?cek had done with the relationship between words and music, coupled with his desire to improve Jan?cek until the composer matched Brod's notion of him ? as a genius infinitely sympathetic to the weaknesses of his 'poor children', but believing ultimately in 'die Unzerst?rbarkeit des Lebens' [the inextinguishability of life] as exemplified by the ending of the Vixen?3 Kundera goes much too far in writing of 'le renoncement de Jan?cek ? une affabulation, ? une action dramatique' [Jan?cek's refusal to adopt a plot or dramatic action] in this opera, but he is right that Brod's suggested additions would in this case have turned Jan?cek's remarkable achievement into kitsch.34 Judentum within a discussion of Brod and Jan?cek, but I remain unconvinced by his attempt to interpret Jenufa in terms of'edles' and 'unedles Ungl?ck' (Ernst, '"Durch kleine Ritze nimmt man Abgr?nde wahr" ', pp. 49-50). Brod was strong-minded enough to regard not only the casualties of war, but even such things as inherited syphilis as examples of'unedles Ungl?ck'. On his terms, surely hardly any of the misfortune in Jenufa can seem noble, with the possible exception of the ending. 32 See Jan?cek, letter to Max Brod, 26 June 1925: Korespondence Leo?e Jan?Hka s Maxem Brodetti, ed. by Racek and Rektorys, pp. 185-86; Tyrrell, Jan??ek's Operas, pp. 299-300 (document LB65).

The Czech translation ('Liska Bystrouska, dr?sav? idyla', p. 44) omits the reference to Brod in this passage.</page><page sequence="16">128 Geoffrey Chew V Much has been written about the place of anthropomorphism in The Cunning Little Vixen, largely because of the role that Brod wished it to play in the opera. To some degree already present in Lolek's drawings, it was well established in T?snohlidek's novel, though mostly for ironic or comic purposes, presenting unexpected reversals of values between humans and animals. A few typical tongue-in-cheek examples may be mentioned, beyond the joke about the vixen's bad upbringing already quoted above: the predilection of a mosquito for buzzing around sweaty humans on pilgrimages is due solely to his fervent Catholicism and his enjoyment of hymn-singing;35 when Lap?k, the dog, sniffs the vixen's genitals at their first acquaintance, 'ocenich?val ji kavalirsky a zdvorile, vsude, kde se slus? a patri, a Bystrouska si duchu fekla: "je vid?t, ze je to vzd?lan? p?n" ' [he took account of her gallantly and courteously, in all the places where it is right and proper so to do, and the vixen said to herself, Obviously he's a real gent'];36 Lap?k is devoted to the arts and sings melancholy songs of his own composition in the evenings, but his master chastises him 'inhumanly' (nelidsky) for them;37 the vixen tells the fox about her prowling, as the prim constitutional she allows herself every day, and he praises her lavishly as 'prost? ide?l moderni d?vky' [simply the ideal of a modern girl], even though this activity takes place between midnight and one o'clock in the morning, when walks by respectable female readers might be misconstrued.38 Some of this anthropomorphism is retained in the opera, also in part for comic purposes: Jan?cek is by no means averse to T?snohlidek's jokes.39 But there is a complication in the opera: probably for reasons of economy in production, Jan?cek made some notes drawing parallels, not found in the novel, between some of the animals and some of the human beings. He may have envisaged these merely as an aid to facilitate casting, allowing singers to take more than one part; but in the subsequent history of the piece, they have been taken to justify a kind of allegorical anthropomorphism alien both to T?snohlidek's original and to Jan?cek's adaptation of it. For, once Brod 35 Tesnohl?dek, Lis*ka BystrouZka, pp. 11-12. 36 Ibid., pp. 27-28. 37 Ibid., p. 29. 38 Ibid., p. 144. 39 There have been interesting differences between productions of the opera from this point of view. Walter Felsenstein's 1956 Berlin production, mentioned below (sect. VI), which first ensured success for the opera outside Czechoslovakia, adopted realistic costumes for the animals, minimizing anthropomorphism; Jonathan Miller's 1975 Glyndebourne production, which marked the Vixen's first success in the English-speaking world, characterized the animals with historic regional costumes devised by Rosemary Vercoe, such as a hussar's uniform for the cock.

In a letter to Brod, which he forwarded to Jan?cek, Hertzka comments: Es [...] w?re w?rmstens zu begr??en, wenn es Ihnen gelingen w?rde, das allerdings schwere Problem der Vermenschlichung der Tiere und das Tierische im Menschen in sinnf?lligere Wechselbeziehungen zu bringen, als dies scheinbar im b?hmischen Buche der Fall war.40 [It would be most welcome if you could succeed in solving the admittedly difficult problem of aligning the humanizing of the animals and the animal element in the humans more clearly than is apparently the case in the Czech libretto.] To do this Brod was thinking of ways in which the animal and human realms in the opera might be linked symbolically; and, apparently in order to increase the degree of 'edles Ungl?ck' in the plot, he hit on the idea of rewriting the whole libretto, not only highlighting the roles of aging and of the cycle of nature, but also strengthening the role of erotic passion within the plot, and imposing an overall symbolic scheme linking animals and humans. The redundancy of much of Jan?cek's Czech dialogue (from a logical point of view) made it possible for him to do this, and to introduce new elements of plot, while leaving the music almost completely intact. As for the role of erotic passion, on 13 June 1925 he wrote to Jan?cek explaining what he had in mind and asking to be allowed a free hand in the translation: Ich stelle mir [...] vor, da? die Bystrouska (F?chsin Schlaukopf) f?r alle Menschen, die in dem St?ck auftreten, so etwas wie das Symbol der Jugend, Wildheit, Natur bedeutet. ? Schulmeister, F?rster und Pfarrer sind alle drei im Leben an ihrem Gl?ck vorbeigegangen. Um die Sache zu vereinfachen [...], will ich es so f?gen, da? alle drei die Terynka, ein Zigeunerkind, geliebt haben, aber alle drei haben nicht die Kraft gehabt, sie festzuhalten. [...] So hoffe ich eine gewisse Einheit in den Text hineinzubringen und Verst?ndlichkeit, dramatische Konzentration zu erzielen.[...] Musikalisch wird nat?rlich nichts ge?ndert ? und die Text?nderungen werden Sie, wie ich hoffe, willkommen hei?en.41 [I propose that the Vixen should signify something like the symbol of youth, wildness and nature for all the human characters in the piece. The schoolmaster, forester and priest have all failed to achieve happiness in their lives. To simplify things I would like to make it that all three of them were formerly in love with Terynka, a gypsy child, but all three of them lacked the power to keep hold of her. Thus I hope to introduce a certain unity to the libretto, aiming at comprehensibility and dramatic concentration. 40 Emil Hertzka, letter to Max Brod, io June 1925: Korespondence Leofe Jan?tka s Maxem Brodetti, ed. by Racek and Rektorys, p. 252. 41 Brod, letter to Jan?cek, 13 June 1925, ibid., pp. 180-81.</page><page sequence="18">130 Geoffrey Chew Musically, of course nothing will be altered, and I hope you will like the changes in the libretto.] In this way Brod invented unfulfilled past love affairs with a mysterious gypsy girl, Terynka, for all three male characters (forester, priest and schoolmaster), and made the vixen a symbol of them; Terynka never appears on stage except in a vision linking her with the vixen. (In the Czech version, she is not a gypsy, but an ordinary woman, worshipped from afar by the schoolmaster, who thinks he is meeting her when, drunk, he sees a sunflower; he sheds a quiet tear when she finally marries Harasta, the poacher; Harasta turns the vixen's pelt into a muff for her.) In promoting Terynka to a Carmen-like (but mute and almost invisible) central role in his German version, Brod undeniably raises the profile of erotic love within the opera; but he does so at the expense of the integrity of both the forester, whose nostalgic recollection of his wedding night at the end of the opera becomes a recollection of a passionate episode with Terynka, and the priest, whose vague memory of a love from student days becomes the seduction of an innocent Terynka during her confirmation classes. Both of these risk appearing sordid rather than noble. It is with the priest that the principal symbolic link is made between animals and humans: the priest is symbolically paired with the badger, both unsympathetic elderly males. On 22 June 1925, Brod wrote again to Jan?cek to explain how he wished to treat the first scene of Act II of the opera (the badger scene discussed above), and how Terynka was to be incorporated, with the addition of a very convoluted narrative for the sake of maintaining the scheme: [Die Terynka] ist ein Zigeunerkind?der F?rster hat sie ins Haus genommen ? dann, als sie es dort zu toll trieb, dem Pfarrer zum Unterricht gegeben ? den aber hat sie in schlechten Ruf gebracht und deshalb mu? er seine Pfarre aufgeben und in eine andere versetzt werden. Nun ist ganz genau mit der Vertreibung des Dachses (B. vyvlast?uje) die Parallele hergestellt. Die Szene mit dem Dachs endet nun nicht mit dem b?hnenunm?glichen Pischen ? sondern so, da? das F?chslein dem Waldgetier erz?hlt, wie der Dachs (Pfarrer) es w?hrend der Konfirmationsstunde mit unsittlichen Antr?gen verfolgt hat. [...] Unter Hallo der Waldtiere k??t das F?chslein ostentativ den emp?rten Dachs, der mit den Worten abgeht: O, ich bin sittlich entr?stet und weiche der frechen Verl?umdung.42 [Terynka is a gypsy child; the forester has taken her in, then, when she became too unmanageable, given her to the priest to teach. But she has brought the priest into ill-repute, so that he has to give up the parish and be transferred. This very precisely establishes a parallel with the expulsion of the badger ('Bystrouska expropriates'). The badger scene now ends, not with the unstageable urination, but with the vixen recounting to the forest animals how the badger (priest) had made improper advances to her during confirmation classes. With derisive cries from the forest animals, the vixen 42 Brod, letter to Jan?cek, 22 June 1925, ibid., pp. 183-84.</page><page sequence="19">The Adventures of The Cunning Little Vixen 131 ostentatiously kisses the indignant badger, who leaves, with the words 'Oh, I am morally outraged, and yield to this impudent slander!'] Jan?cek's response to this proposal ? which might have increased the logic of the scene, but at the expense of both simplicity and comedy ? is very well known. On 26 June, in a letter already quoted above, he refused to countenance the 'ostentatious kissing' of the badger in this scene, and equally refused to delete the episode with the frog at the end of the opera, whose originality he emphasized: 1. Nen? mozn?, aby ta Liska-Bystrouska l?bala toho jezevce! D?vod t? sc?ny: vyvlast?ovac? ? komunisticky je tu jedin? mozny! 2. A konec opery! Vzdyt'je to roztomil?, kdyz ji ta z?bicka ukonc?! Hudba je na to jako 'usit?'. A origineln? je to ? a kolotoc zivota tak je t?m pravdiv? a verne zn?zornen!43 [ . It is impossible to have the vixen kiss that badger! The only possible reason for that scene is expropriative and communistic! 2. And the ending of the opera! For it's charming to have the little frog conclude it! The music fits it like a glove. And it's original ? and the carousel of life is depicted by it truly and faithfully!] Brod relented as far as the frog was concerned, but in the badger scene he would only compromise to the extent of having the vixen expose her backside to the badger. VI One might argue, generally, that seen in the light of his Heidentum ? Christentum ?Judentum Brod's version of the opera is an explicitly Jewish reinterpretation of a story infected (because of Jan?cek's non-traditional approach to the relationship between words and music) by paganism. It is an attempt to realize the full potential, in wide human ideals, of a narrative apparently too often bogged down in irrelevant detail and therefore limited to the values of this world. And these wider ideals are those of the via media between paganism and Christianity offered by an infinitely sympathetic and tender-hearted Judaism. This is the religion able to see and accept the foibles of human beings, driven as they are primarily by sexual passion, and yet to interpret them in religious terms. And, bizarrely, Brod saw this Judaism embodied in Jan?cek. It might therefore seem even stranger that Brod should have thought his version the one most likely to succeed in German theatres. But in the event, despite the fate that befell Jewish art and music under the Nazis and later, he was largely correct, and his conception of the opera has had, and still has, astonishingly wide currency, perhaps largely because his German version has been preserved in the edition published by Universal Edition in Vienna. 43 Jan?cek, letter to Max Brod, 26 June 1925, ibid., pp. 185-86; Tyrrell, Janatek's Operas, pp. 299-300 (document LB65).</page><page sequence="20">132 Geoffrey Chew Its apparent plausibility may be measured by the fact that it still underlies one of the main analytical essays devoted to this opera in English, by Nors P. Josephson, which (in apparent ignorance of the differences between the Czech libretto and Brod's translation of it) absurdly seeks to show that Jan?cek himself constructed patterns of motivic and tonal unity that were rooted in Brod's idea of'edles Ungl?ck': Jan?cek's musical organization of his opera The Cunning Little Vixen clearly supports the principal dramatic issues and relationship[s] outlined in the libretto. Just as the two embodiments of the 'eternal feminine' complex ? the Vixen and Terynka ? are musically interrelated through various subtle permutations of [the allegedly central] motives and y, much the same holds true for the principal male characters in Terynka's life, who tend to be associated with erotic metamorphoses of x. As the drama progresses, the latter variants tend to assume fatalistically descending, dotted rhythmic patterns set to wh-t I pitches [i.e. pitches drawn from the whole-tone scale based on C rather than that on C sharp].44 And in German theatres, Brod's version still holds sway. As the basis for the celebrated production by Walter Felsenstein in East Berlin in 1956, it was the version that fuelled the eventual acceptance of this opera in the wider world;45 and, amazingly, it still remains the normal German translation, whether in its original form or in subsequent adaptations. (German opera houses now sometimes use a translation by the director Peter Brenner ? but Brenner is Felsenstein's son, and even his translation is still strongly based on Brod's.46) Whether or not this implies that German theatres respond only to ultra traditional dramaturgy, it certainly means, as Leon Botstein has testily argued, that we owe a great deal to Brod.47 44 Josephson, 'Musical and Dramatic Organization', p. 90. The use of keys which Josephson identifies as unifying the opera might best be understood, perhaps, in terms of Jan?cek's own longstanding idiosyncratic preferences. 45 See Ernst, ' "Durch kleine Ritze nimmt man Abgr?nde wahr" ', Chapter 9, and 'Das schlaue F?chslein' von Leo?Jan?tek. 'Und doch ist in der Musik nur eine Wahrheit' ? Zu Walter Felsensteins Inszenierung an der Komischen Oper Berlin (1956), ed. by Ilse K b?n, Wort und Musik 33 (Anif bei Salzburg, 1997). 46 The current production (2009) at the Cologne Opera is still using Brod's translation, for example. As for the extent to which Brenner's adaptation remains faithful to Brod's conception, see an extract from Chantal Steiner's review of the 2006 Zurich production (Vox spectatricis, 16 October 2006), which used it: 'Der F?rster, der Schulmeister und der Pfarrer [sitzen] in der Gaststube und sinnieren ?ber eine junge Frau namens Terynka (die nie auftaucht), die ihr seelisches Gleichgewicht durcheinander gebracht hat' [The forester, the schoolmaster and the priest sit in the inn and reminisce about a young woman called Terynka (who never appears), who has destroyed their spiritual equilibrium]. 47 Leon Botstein, 'The Cultural Politics of Language and Music: Max Brod and Leos Jan?cek', in Jan?iek and his World, ed. by Michael Beckerman (Princeton, NJ, 2003), pp. 13-36. Botstein does not, however, confront the nature of Brod's translations or their implications in his article.</page></plain_text>
