<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gorillas among Us: A Primate Ethnographer's Book of Days. Dawn Prince- Hughes. Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2001, 130 pp., 13 illustrations. $40.00, cloth; $17.95, paper. The very title of Prince-Hughes's book tells you that this is not your typical study of primate behavior. She refers to herself as a "primate ethnographer"-not a primatologist or a behaviorist or an ethologist, but an ethnographer. This title, and indeed the language and style in which this book is written, is likely to strike some members of the anthropology community as problematical. Those on the cultural end of the anthropological spectrum may object to the idea of an ethnography and/ or ethnographer of nonhuman primates, as ethnography is typically a term applied to studies of humans and human culture in a social context. Similarly, those on the biological end of the spectrum may object to the potentially anthropomorphic, and therefore nonscientific, nature of such a designation. All of these objectors and their objections would be justified. This book is, indeed, an unusual approach to nonhuman primates, and it is somewhat anthropomorphic and nonscientific as well. However, Prince-Hughes did not set out to write a scientific precis of Gorilla gorilla gorilla behavior. She wants to tell a story. She wants, in her own words, "to weave science, and stories, and poetry" (p. 128). She wants to present the reader with glimpses of what it is like to study captive gorillas, of what it is like to be a captive gorilla, of what it is like to come to understand just how close humans and gorillas really are on many levels, and finally of what it is like to come to this realization.

This history extends to a mixture of fact and speculation about scenarios under which those that were wild-born might have been acquired. This is followed by her "book of days"-a journal format collection of her stories of the gorillas and their behaviors that are presented as spanning February 28 of one year through March 4 of another. She admits that while the stories are true and based upon her notes, the characters and contents represent a composite. Therefore, this year may very well represent several. Each of her "entries" tends to focus on a particular topic or aspect of gorilla behavior, such as tool use, birth, food sharing, nest building, play, and imitation. Prince-Hughes's work contains many facts about captive and wild gorilla behavior, bipedalism, primates' understanding of numbers, primate evolution, and the status of gorilla conservation-just to name a few subjects covered. The illustrations by Anne Hulse, particularly those of individual's faces, are excellent. However, the book also contains much speculation about gorilla thoughts, emotions, and intent and includes the occasional diversion into somewhat less relevant topics such as the history of the Christmas tree. In the end, I am left with somewhat mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is an interesting and very fast read. At 130 pages, one can breeze through it in just a couple of hours. It does not dwell upon dry, technical details nor use complicated, scientific terminology or jargon. Therefore, it does not require much time or thought investment on the part of the reader. Certainly, anyone looking for an interesting, light read that focuses on gorillas would not be disappointed. On the other hand, it is not a scientific treatise. Although it was not Prince-Hughes's intention for it to be so, this does complicate what one can "do" with the book. Other than a couple of random facts, I do not feel that I learned much in reading this book. I realize, though, that my not finding it particularly intellectually stimulating is colored by years of reading other books and articles addressing gorilla behavior. While I do not think this book would be appropriate as a primate behavior text and I would not recommend its use in sophomore or higher-level courses, I do think it has a potential use in a four-field Introduction to Anthropology course as a supplemental read for first-year students. In such a course, one generally has little time to devote to examining primate behavior and seldom gets into the specifics of any particular species. I can see where this brief foray into gorilla behavior would be informative, useful, and even enjoyable for the first-year student. I believe that it could have an impact upon the novice reader. That reader will learn a bit about gorillas and may be inspired to contribute in some way to the conservation of this or other primate species. Vicki K.
