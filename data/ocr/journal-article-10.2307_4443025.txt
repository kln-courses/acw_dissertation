<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gimmicks in the Biology Classroom RICHARD J. MEDVE, Slippery Rock (Pa.) State College oo often we biology teachers get into a teaching rut by using the same basic routine day after day. Sometimes this rut is forced upon us by the admin- istration through scheduling: on Tuesdays and Thursdays classes are assigned to the laboratory and on the other three days they are scheduled for the classroom. In other cases we get into this rut through expediency: Monday is film day, Tuesday is answer-the-chapter-questions day, Wednesday is lab day, Thursday is review day, and Friday is test day. Equally guilty is the teacher who lectures every day or has a lab every day or uses a demon- stration every day or has the overhead projector somehow worked into his daily lessons. These kinds of repetitious activities are boring to students. Learning activities usually are designed around behavioral objectives. But what about the vehicle that will be used to obtain these objectives? Lessons must not only be interesting and pedagogically sound-they must be entertaining. Once objectives have been established for a lesson, methodology becomes the primary concern. A few of the factors that influence choice of method include class size, equipment, student abil- ity, physical layout of the room, length of the period, and subject matter. We must, however, also be cog- nizant of other important factors that are often over- looked, such as the day of the week, nearness to holidays, assemblies and other special events, and the classroom activities that occurred during the last biology class and the activity that will probably follow. An eight o'clock class on Monday is quite different from a two o'clock class on Friday after- noon, and a class before lunch differs from a class after lunch. Ever notice differences in the behavior of the same class on a bright sunny day and on a dark rainy day? Do students react differently on the last day of school before Christnas vacation? After a few years' experience a teacher begins to develop teaching methods and gimmicks that can be used to stay out of the teaching rut and to accommo- date difficult periods of the kinds I have mentioned. The purpose of this article is to familiarize the in- experienced teacher with several gimmicks that can make teaching and learning more enjoyable. Games. Television and radio game-programs, such as "Concentration," "To Tell the Truth," "Twenty Questions," "College Bowl," "Beat the Clock," and "Hollywood Squares," can, with a little imagination and preparation, easily be adapted to the biology classroom. Traditional games, such as clue-me-in, spell-down, and hangman, can be used as a substitute for boring question-and-answer re- view sessions, and they can also be used on those days before vacation or an assembly. Teachers can capitalize on student interests by devising games like biology baseball and biology football. Biology bingo (Suggested by my colleague Virginia May; see box for rules) is not only fun but also a good reinforcement exercise. Although some teachers give extra credit to the winner, most teachers find that just having the com- petition between the boys and the girls or between row 1 and row 2 or between brown-eyed students and blue-eyed students makes for an exciting game. Simulations. Try acting out mitosis, meiosis, pro- tein synthesis, or DNA replication. Either have the student act out the part of some structure or have 237</page><page sequence="2">him carry a model to represent a structure and move it through its various functions. Unusual assignments. Students get tired of an- swering the questions at the end of the chapter or defining words in the vocabulary. The objectives of these assignments can be accomplished by utilizing scramble puzzles (see box for example), crossword puzzles, find-the-hidden-words puzzles, or the vaca- tion quiz. These gimmicks can also be used during those difficult days previously mentioned. Try con- structing one of these instruments: it takes time and skill. Biology in the fine arts. Paintings, poems, and music can easily be used at various times to intro- duce a new topic, wind up a unit, or break up the classroom routine. "Lament of a Field Biologist" (Folkerts, 1969) is a good poem from which to launch a discussion of man's role in the ecosystem. Tatroe and Rivas (1965) published a number of songs written by college students. These include "The Cell Theory," "Krebs Cycle," "Elegy to a Wet Mount," "Red Cross Rhythm," and "Thread of Life." While Frederick Hamilton (1968) was a high school sophomore he wrote "Cell War;" the story re- flects a good deal of knowledge about cell structures. Each of these gimmicks can be used as such during a class; or you can have your students do a similar assignment. "The Eve of Meiosis" (Himes, 1965) is an excellent gimmick to use on the last school day be- fore Christmas vacation. Biology humor. Some teachers tell jokes just to use up class time. But humor is found throughout the biologic sciences and can easily become an in- tegral part of the lesson. The bluegill's comment to the pike, "No, I'm not going out with you-you're just not my species," and the amoeba's complaint to the paramecium that "the higher animals have all the fun" are good starting points for a number of topics. Many comic-strip characters are based on animal nature, and thus are a good initial source for starting your collection of biology jokes. Supplementary readings. Take a class period to read an article from Science World, Science Digest, or Reader's Digest. Popular articles on biologic themes are good for breaking up the monotony of plodding through successive chapters. "The Abso- lute Weapon" (McConnell, 1961) is a short article that can be read during a class period and discussed in terms of its social implications, biologic accuracy, and contemporary application. A timely article is "The Alarming Case Against DDT" (Miller, 1969). Find-the4allacy. Two days before report cards are issued, students invariably want to know, "What can I do for extra credit?" Find-the-fallacy, a girn- mick that applies biologic information and scientific reasoning, is a good device for extra credit. Have the students bring to class any magazine, book, and newspaper items that vriolate biologic concepts. (Movies, television, and radio are good sources but difficult to check for accuracy in a student's report.) How to Play Biology Bingo Each student folds a sheet of paper into 16 squares to make a player's card. Sixteen biological terms are written on the chalk- board, and students randomly write one term in each square. Before the game, the teacher prepares questions, each of which can be answered by one of the terms on the board. After the teacher reads a question, the students write the question number beside the correct answer on their card. When a student indicates that he has a bingo, the teacher checks his card to be sure that the correct answer was chosen for each question. If a student is correct, the game is over. If a student is wrong, the same game is continued until there is a correct bingo. The student who was wrong also continues to play, but he must work to- wards a different bingo. The questions and terms may be changed after a few bingos, if many games are to be played. A Word Scramble About Insects Each of the scrambled words represents a term used in connection with a unit on social insects. Unscrambled words are to be written in the blanks provided. The letters marked "x " are to be unscrambled to form the two words to complete the riddle. NEDRO x EIHV x AENDC x MENHYETROPA x UEENQ x INTACES X ORKERW x RVAAL x LYLEJ x LANPOLTINOI x RATCEN x QUESTION: Why do bees buzz? ANSWER: You would buzz too if someone stole your ?_ _ and ? 238 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, APRIL 1970</page><page sequence="3">For example, Walt Disney's animated cartoon of Mickey Mouse and the gang in "Jack and the Bean- stalk" shows the beanstalk growing through the house and out the window. The house is caught on some of the branches and carried into the clouds. Evidently someone didn't understand plant growth! Biologic errors are also common in the popular liter- ature, as in the statement, "the blade itself makes food by absorbing sunlight and moisture from the air." Teleology and anthropomorphism are commonly found in magazines and newspapers. Here are two examples: "Grass roots need water and actually creep through the ground reaching out for it;" and "Plant stems bend toward light so that they can carry on photosynthesis." The first student to bring the fallacy to class and explain it correctly is given extra credit. You will be surprised at the number of fallacies that will turn up. These also make good test questions, because the explanations usually require a good deal of under- standing. Student debates. Sex, evolution, cancer, smoking, and drugs are a few of the topics that students want to know about and discuss. Let the students re- search these topics and present their viewpoints during an organized debate. If we teachers can learn to keep quiet long enough, we will be amazed at how much these students know about such topics and how eager they are to learn more. A skillful teacher can guide one of these debates, interject cor- rected biologic concepts, and wind up with the stu- dents enjoying the class and probably learning more than if the usual classroom routine had been fol- lowed. Concept-building. This is a good method for re- viewing. A student starts out by stating a concept from the unit on which the class will be tested. After the concept is given, another student states whether the concept is valid. If it is not valid, the student must correct it, and a third student determines whether it is now valid. If it is, this student adds a related concept. What is it? Some teachers use this idea by dis- playing organisms in a showcase or on a table and giving extra credit to the first person who correctly identifies the specimens. Once an organism has been identified the teacher can relate some interesting information to the class about the new addition to the biology room. A live snapping turtle, sensitive plant, pitcher plant, or praying mantis will do won- ders for class interest. Although the organism may not be directly relevant to the topic currently being discussed, displaying it is sure to perk up enthu- siasm. Think sheets. These are devices for developing the students' abilities to attack scientific problems and solidify concepts. For example, from a unit on energy transformation they will understand that plants conduct photosynthesis but may gain the false notion that only the animals carry on respiration. The "think sheet" (see box) points out the miscon- ception. Think sheets are most worthwhile when used as a homework assignment and then discussed during the following class period. Schwab (1963) refers to these items as "invitations to inquiry" and includes a number of them in the Biology Teachers' Handbook. An Example of a "Think Sheet" PROCEDURE 300 pea seeds were divided into three groups of 100 each. Group 1-100 seeds were dried in an oven then weighed. Group 2-100 seeds were planted in a box of soil and were kept in a lighted, controlled environment room for two weeks. The plants were then oven-dried and weighed. Group 3-100 seeds were planted in a box of soil and were kept in a dark, controlled environment room for two weeks. The plants were then oven-dried and weighed. RESULTS Group 1-Weight of 100 oven-dried seeds 30.2 grams Group 2-Weight of 100 oven-dried plants from light room 37.5 grams Group 3-Weight of 100 oven-dried plants from dark room 13.4 grams QUESTIONS Use the data from this experiment to answer the fol- lowing questions. 1. Is light necessary for the utilization of foods? What evidence? 2. Is light necessary for the growth of plants? What evidence? 3. Explain what would have happened to the plants in the dark room if they hadn't been harvested. 4. What physiologic process was occurring in the plants in the light that would account for the increase in weight? 5. What physiologic process was occurring in the plants in the dark that would chiefly account for the de- crease in weight? 6. Compute the approximate amount of food produced in the plants in the light. 7. Why isn't the answer to number 6 the exact answer? Homework questions. Recall questions are neces- sary to point out facts basic to the understanding of concepts. Application questions, however, should also be included in homework assignments or as leading questions in class. Being able to define dif- fusion, osmosis, permeability, and active transport is important to an understanding of the transport of materials in and out of cells; but can the student use this basic vocabulary to explain hemolysis of red blood cells or the presence of dead plants along highways after the spring thaw? Tealche.r personality. Enthusiasml is catching; in- terest permeates; selected mannerisms get attention. Using your personality to its fullest extent can be one of the most productive gimmicks. An entertainer GIMMICKS IN THE BIOLOGY CLASSROOM 239</page><page sequence="4">maintains the attention of his audience by "selling" himself. Teachers can do this, too. (Enthusiasm and interest must be genuine; students easily see through a mere facade.) The teacher should try to use gestures, facial mannerisms, and voice control in really effective ways. The teacher who feels duty-bound to complete the book or is content to stay in his cozy rut or sticks to last year's lessons because they worked so well will not be interested in many of these gimmicks. They take as much time to prepare as does a labora- tory investigation or a demonstration. In addition, most of these activities diverge radically from prac- tices in the traditional classroom, where 30 sleepy students are listening to number 54 in a series of 170 biology lectures. But learning can be fun-if we are willing to incorporate some of these gimmicks into the academic portion of the biology course. When stu- dents enjoy going to biology class, one can be sure the teacher is staying clear of classroom ruts. REFERENCES FOLKERTS, G. W. 1969. "Lament of a field biologist." Turtox News 47 (5): 174.

Support A shorter time spent in training for the doctoral degree, a better chance of getting an immediate post- doctoral research fellowship, and greater post-train- ing research productivity: These characteristics dis- tinguish bioscience graduate students who have re- ceived support from the National Institute of Gener- al Medical Sciences (NIGMS), according to a report issued by the Office of Scientific Personnel of the National Research Council. The report, "Effects of NIGMS Training Pro- grams on Graduate Education in the Biomedical Sciences," is based on a four-year study of the pat- terns of NIGMS support to bioscience departments and graduate students from 1958, when the institute was begun, through 1967. It notes that a total of approximately 7,700 persons-1,100 per year-are re- ceiving NIGMS training support for graduate study through traineeships (typically first-year graduate students selected by local program directors) and fellowships (typically second- or third-year gradu- ate students). Some students received both trainee- ship and fellowship support. At some time during the period covered by this study, 400 of the 761 departments that granted doc- torates in nine bioscience fields (biochemistry, path- ology, physiology, microbiology, pharmacology, bio- metrics, anatomy, biophysics, and genetics) received NIGMS training grants. These 400 departments ac- counted for 73% of the research doctorates awarded in those fields. Single copies of the report are available on re- quest from Paul A. Deming, NIGMS Office of In- formation, 5333 Westbard Ave., Bethesda, Md. 20014. SELENIUM AN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT? Current federal regulations prohibit the addi- tion of selenium to processed foods. Nevertheless this widely found element may prove to be an essen- tial nutrient, a team of Michigan State University pathologists reported. Although selenium appears to be toxic under cer- tain conditions, the MSU pathologists found that baby pigs raised on selenium-free diets had necrosis of the liver. Supplementing the diets with vitamin E lessened the severity of the necrosis but did not prevent it. For several years now, selenium has been a topic of controversy among veterinarians, livestock own- ers, researchers, and the federal government. Al- though it is not allowed in manufactured feeds, it is presumably available to many animals because it occurs naturally in the soil and is taken up and con- centrated by certain plants, especially weeds. In the Dakotas, horses and cows frequently die of "al- kali disease," which is attributed to either too much selenium or to selenium that is chemically bound to other elements in such a way that it is toxic. The Trumpeter Swan The trumpeter swan is the largest North Ameri- can waterfowl. Recognized by its snow-white body and booming call, it is considered one of the most majestic of water birds. Some records indicate a life span of 30 to 50 years. Breeding does not generally occur until the bird is five years old. The trumpeter swan is making a strong comeback from near- extinction. 240 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, APRIL 1970</page></plain_text>
