<plain_text><page sequence="1">Capturing the Educational Potential of 'Creation Science Debates' David Mercer Introduction In the following discussion, I will consider the way debates about science and religion, and the creation science debate in particular; often encourage a discourse that is excessively preoccupied with attempting to resolve larger debates in epistemology involved with demarcating science and identifying and describing the philosophical essences of science and religion. Why I describe these preoccupations as "excessive" is (1) that they frequendy involve trying to resolve simplistically, expeditiously, and at the expense of any contextual history of science and religion, complex and largely intractable debates in philosophy; (2) that these preoccupations also contribute to poor "public" and policy understandings of science, most notably in legal and media discourse; (3) that concerns raised by creationism have been used as a resource by some to discourage science educators from drawing on more sophisticated understand- ings of science developed in science studies: understandings, which have the potential to avoid some tensions flowing from creation science debates. To support these claims I will first outline a brief critique of the idea that simple contrasts can be drawn between science and religion. Next, I will provide four brief case studies from a variety of contexts where creation science debates have been played out that illustrate how preoccupations with defining the essences of science and religion can become inconclusive and distracting. These case studies will be discussed under the following four headings: (1) attentive popular science, (2) legal commentary, (3) creation science/ science and the media and (4) "anti-science studies." I will conclude by providing a prelimi- nary sketch of some of the ways science education and popularization of science could be improved by paying more attention to science as local knowl- edge and practice. "Contrasting" Science and Religion Historian of science John Hedley Brooke has noted three typical largely inadequate contrasts that are frequendy drawn between science and religion: Science . . . operates within a "world view" that regards natural phenomena as the prod- uct of impersonal forces. By contrast, religious and magical systems involve personal- ized gods, spirits, or demons. Whereas the scientific enterprise is legitimated by agreed testing procedures, the theological enterprise has been characterized by dogmatism.</page><page sequence="2">44 THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL Whereas religions have required worship, ceremony, and sacrifice, these are forms of activity alien to Western Science. (Brooke, 1991, pp. 17-18) Numerous examples can be used to encourage reflection on the adequacy of drawing such binary distinctions between the supposed essences of science and religion (Wilson, 2002). To complicate Brooke's first contrast that science relies exclusively on natu- ralistic explanation, we can consider the numerous conflicts within various sciences at different times about whether or not explanations are truly naturalis- tic (Brooke, 1991). It has been historically shown that scientific ideas are linked in important ways to their wider social contexts. This means that even if the ideal aim of scientific practice is to only use naturalistic explanations, such explanations will still carry with them linguistic and rhetorical resonances reflecting the social context of their emergence and acceptance. For example, Darwin's appeal to the idea of the "survival of the fittest" as the causal motor for his theory of evolution by natural selection was both an attempt to provide a naturalistic explanation for evolutionary process and also a metaphor self consciously borrowed from the political writings of Herbert Spencer (Young, 1985). More recently, sociobiologists have been critiqued for introducing anthropomorphic and gendered presuppositions into their attempts to analyze human behavior (Gould, 1977). Moving on to consider Brooke's next contrast that, unlike religious dogma- tism, testing and organized skepticism are important ingredients of science, a closer empirical examination suggests that scientific practices are much more diverse (Mulkay, 1979). Studies of scientific communities both in historical and contemporary contexts have in fact suggested that dogmatism has not been an unusual feature of science (Barnes, 1982) and that the significance of testing, the types of tests possible, the prominence of fundamental untestable laws and assertions vary between different areas of science (Collins and Pinch, 1993). To complicate these stereotypes further, whereas formal doctrines of empirical testing may have not played a significant role in major religious beliefs, Brooke points out that "self criticism and renewal" have often encouraged sectarianism and reform movements and have been one of the challenges faced by many orthodox religious institutions. A number of empirically orientated studies of creation science movements (Nelkin, 1977; Locke, 1994) have also noted the similarity between more sophisticated creationists and scientists in their styles of rhetoric and appeals to ideals of scientific method. These studies suggest that dismissing all creation science claims out of hand on the basis that their aims are fundamentally dogmatic and different to science relies on a caricature of both science and creation science. It is also worth noting that even at a broader level of "ideal" images of the cognitive orientation of science, complexities still appear. As Margaret Wertheim has noted, claims that science has an ideal commitment to privilege certain types of material and mathematical explana-</page><page sequence="3">DAVID MERCER 45 dons is in itself an article of faith; an assumption about the way the world is; a commitment that cannot itself be tested or challenged: The idea that the ontology of the universe can be explained by mathematical laws is itself a faith position, as is the notion that the origin of life can be explained from the laws of chemistry. These are articles of faith that I share, yet we who believe in purely material accounts of our origins must be honest that this is not a logically demonstrable position. Creationists have their beliefs, we have ours. (Wertheim, 1999, p. 22) Considering Brooke's final contrast that science is an archetypically imper- sonal enterprise lacking in ritual, numerous scientists across history have spoken of scientific enterprise as a way of partaking in God's work, or seeing nature through the "mind of God" (Brooke, 1991; Nelkin, 2004). Attempts to popular- ize science have also led to the public projection of scientific work in ritualized terms replete with quasi-religious symbols and resonances. To support this, we need go no further than to consider the exhibits appearing in many science museums (Gregory and Miller, 1998) or revisit some of the foundational texts of enlightenment humanism such as those by Comte, which reappropriated religious ritual in a detailed and quite deliberate manner (Brooke and Cantor, 1998). A critic could respond to these examples by suggesting that they are not indicative of the dominant "day-to-day" patterns of scientific and religious interaction that are unproblematic and function with a tacit acceptance of many of the kinds of dichotomies that Brooke challenges. But this point simply does not help us understand a number of contemporary areas of scientific contro- versy involving things such as human cloning, genetic modification of organ- isms, and evolutionary psychology, where the disputes over setting boundaries between science and society involve metaphysical as well as instrumental concerns. The tendency to draw boundaries between science and religion as if they are natural and unproblematic ignores the internal disagreements typical of areas of new science, the challenge that such science may constitute to forms of religious thought, which itself can be fluid, and disguises political commitments influencing where boundaries are set (Gieryn, 1998). To again quote Wertheim: If Christians have been encroaching onto scientific territory, more and more scientists are encroaching on . . . issues of morality and meaning, of human behavior and motiva- tion. Most notably, evolutionary psychologists are increasingly claiming that qualities such as altruism, filial affection and sexual preference can be explained by genetic and evolutionary means. Neuroscientists are even claiming to explain mystical experiences in neurochemical terms. (Wertheim, 1999, p. 22) Attentive Popular Science Debates about evolution and religion have encouraged a significant body of "popular scholarly" discussion. Much of this discussion has been aimed at a</page><page sequence="4">46 THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL "science attentive" audience ahead of specialist academic audiences. Publicly 'visible scientists' such as the late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and eminent geneticist Richard Dawkins provide good examples of commentators in this genre (Gregory and Miller, 1998). One of the most dominant features of this genre has been for analysis to be prefigured by attempts to define the essential differences between the two relevant domains: science and religion. Although such an exercise offers an intuitively plausible starting point for discussion, as I have shown above, trying to arrive at essential incontestable definitions of science and religion is a deceptively difficult exercise. In a commentary on recent moves to encourage improved dialogue between science and religion, Eugenie Scott, executive director of the US National Center for Sdence Education , provides a sophisticated example of how the types of "con- trasts" critiqued above permeate "attentive popular science" discussions of creation science (Scott, 2003). Scott contends that science and religion have historically interacted in four main ways: (1) warfare, (2) separate realms, (3) accommodation, and (4) engagement. In the warfare approach, there is no middle ground, coexistence is discouraged since religious thought is interpreted as irrational and an obstacle to scientific and human progress. Scott includes classic exponents of the "conflict thesis," such as A. D. White and modern figures such as Johnson and Dawkins in the warfare camp. The most notable exponent of Scott's second "separate realms" approach is Stephen Jay Gould, who believes that religion and science serve different purposes that, if properly recognized, would remove the basis for conflict Gould has described this "proposed settlement" using the acronym NOAIA : Non Overlapping Magisteria (Gould, 1999). Scotťs third approach, the "accommodation model," suggests that theological understanding can benefit from engagement with science and theology reinterpreted in light of scientific findings. Scott notes that this has normally been the case of religion reorienting key beliefs to satisfy new scientific insights. Her fourth approach, the "engage- ment model," suggests a more even relationship where both domains can enrich themselves by asking new questions and combine epistemological insights. One imagines that somewhere in the accommodation and engagement models would be located many "new-age" perspectives and the theological speculations of scientists such as Paul Davies who see evidence for the existence of God in the intricacies of contemporary physics (Brooke and Cantor, 1998). Scotťs categories do capture some of the different ways science and relig- ion have interacted, but she nevertheless undermines the value of these observations when she follows them by calling on the reader to remember that despite such religious diversity there is still "only one science"(Scott, 2003, p. 114). The idea that there is "only one science" is a message that would be con- tested by a diverse cross section of historians and philosophers of science. I will return to consider this theme later. Aside from these broader historical and philosophical objections, Scott's insistence that there is only one science is also</page><page sequence="5">DAVID MERCER 47 difficult to sustain in the light of more immediate considerations, including some of her own work published elsewhere. For example, in an earlier paper Scott (1997) promotes the notion that one of the potential ways that conflict between science and religion can be diffused in educational contexts is for science teaching to be "methodologically materialist" in its orientation (deny the relevance of metaphysical forms of explanation to understanding scientific domains), but avoid being "philosophically materialist" in its orientation (avoid denying the relevance of other nonscientific materialist forms of explanation for other nonscientific domains). Further, undermining her contention that there is only one science, she notes that a number of scientists approach the matter differendy: Vocal proponents of evolutionary materialism such as William Provine at Cornell, Paul Kurtz at the State University of New York, Buffalo, and Daniel Dennet at Tufts vigor- ously argue that Darwinism makes religion obsolete, and encourage their colleagues to argue likewise. Although I share a similar metaphysical position, I suggest that it is unwise for several reasons to promote this view as 'the' scientific one. (Scott, 1997, p. 518) Scott could have added the well-known differences between scientists such as Richard Dawkins, who has for many years vigorously proposed that science has and should take precedence over forms of religious thought (Dawkins, 2003), and the late Stephen Jay Gould, who, as noted above, argued for mutual respect for the philosophical differences between the two domains. To suggest that there is only one science glosses over the way eminent scientists such as Gould and Dawkins have "set" the boundaries between science, society, and religion in completely different ways. It is also unclear whether Scott's map is an attempt to capture the actual relations between science and religion as practices, or rather the different ways some commentators have characterized the relationship between science and religion. Returning to consider Brooke's "contrasts," a more detailed history of the complex interactions between science and religion readily exposes how the types of dichotomies identified above, and the desire to specify essences of science (and religion), do not fit neatly with a more contextual investigation of the histories of science and religion. A more complex model also helps explain why even sophisticated attempts to map the relations between science and religion such as Scott's are difficult to fashion in any consistent and reliable way. Legal Commentary An informative parallel discourse to the one discussed above involves the numerous attempts to define the essence of science and its contrasts to religion in the various legal contexts that have arisen in relation to disputes about the teaching of evolution and creation science. Again, most of these disputes have taken place in the US, although there have been some notable "variations on the theme" elsewhere.</page><page sequence="6">48 THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL Gieryn, Bevins, and Zehr compared the images of science produced in two famous American creation science cases: the Scopes in the 1920s and McLean in the 1980s (Gieryn, Bevins, and Zehr, 1985). They identified that a central theme in the professional rhetoric of science during the "Scopes era" of the 1920s was partly to show the centrality and utility of science to American culture but also to emphasize that science was still complementary to religion. By the "McLean era" of the 1980s, the professional rhetoric of science was much more exclu- sionary. Its central preoccupation was to exclude pseudoscience and maintain control over funding. Each form of rhetoric associated with different cultural eras represented science's differing professional "self-reflections." The preoc- cupations of McLean would still appear to be predominant (Shermer, 1997). The McLean vs. Arkansas case provides a valuable microcosm to consider the problems noted in the last section. Here, historian and philosopher of science Michael Ruse acting as an expert witness helped contribute to a definition of science that was ultimately adopted by the court: Science (1) is guided by natural law; (2) is explanatory by reference to natural law; (3) is testable against the empirical world; (4) Its conclusions are tentative; and (5) is falsifiable. (Ruse, 1996a) Ruse's "definition," aside from its functional success in the specific context of the McLean case, raised the concerns of some of his philosophical colleagues who suggested that he had helped develop an unsound philosophy of science simply tailored to impede creation science being accepted by the court. Larry Laudan (1982) and Michael Quinn (1984) suggested that Ruse's model of science was unrepresentative of debates within the philosophy of science, in particular its reliance on the demarcation criteria of falsification drawn from the work of Sir Karl Popper. Echoing Wertheim, Lauden noted the prevalence of unfalsifiable assertions that lie at the core of many important areas of science. He also noted that some claims by creationists made in McLean may have, in fact, passed the criteria of being falsifiable and thus count as being framed in scientific terms, which obscured the more salient issue, that the claims were simply empirically unsustainable: something that could be relatively easily demonstrated without the need for absolute philosophical demarcation criteria between science and non-science. Despite the diversity of different philosophical models that can be devel- oped to attempt to demarcate science from non-science, and the philosophical challenges involved, a number of legal commentators still use creation science debates as a vehicle to promote philosophically incoherent and syncretic legal definitions of science tailored to deny creation science scientific status in legal contexts. A recent discussion of the legal status of "intelligent design" as science or religion provides a good example of such expeditious folk epistemol- ogy. Theresa Wilson, Assistant Appellant Defender, Office of the State De- fender, De Moines, Iowa (Wilson, 2003) argues that the courts need to go beyond McLean and adopt a more comprehensive and onerous definition of</page><page sequence="7">DAVID MERCER 49 science. She proposes criteria that contain logical, empirical, sociological, and historical dimensions: To satisfy the logical criteria, a theory must be a 'simple, unifying idea that postulates nothing unnecessary, have a consistent internal logic, be logically falsifiable, and have clearly expressed boundary conditions. To satisfy the empirical criteria a theory must be empirically testable or lead to predictions or retrodictions that are empirically testable and verifiable, concern reproducible results, and provide criteria for the interpretation of data. To satisfy the sociological criteria, a theory must solve problems or questions unresolvable (sic) with preexisting theories, pose new problems for scientists to study, and a "paradigm" including new concepts and definitions by which problems can be studied. Finally, a theory must satisfy historical criteria by surpassing all previous theo- ries in its explanation of relevant phenomena and is consistent with already validated ancillary scientific theories. [Footnotes omitted from the quotatiori' (Wilson 2003, p. 14). There would appear to be little cognizance on the part of Wilson that such a definition may be philosophically incoherent, for example, linking falsifiability, empirical confirmation, and possession of a paradigm, plus a mix of so-called sociological and historical factors, means a theory has to satisfy a strict set of criteria drawn from competing and contradictory philosophies of science. Demarcation criteria "purpose built" to dismiss creation science or intelligent design may also be double-edged in their application and lead to problems in neighboring areas of law where definitions of science are also sought. For instance Popper's falsification criterion has been a favorite method doctrine of some to critique Marxism and psychiatry and some creation science claims, but falsification can also be used to cast doubts about the scientific veracity of some aspects of evolutionary biology, where arguably a number of key concepts are difficult to test in any simple way. A similar problem and cluster of issues has surrounded the attempts by the US Supreme Court to define science following the widely known Daubert case in 1993 (Edmond and Mercer, 1996, 1998). Interestingly, in Daubert , where the court's main preoccupations were with toxic torts, a similar checklist to McLean was proposed but without reference to natural law (Edmond and Mercer, 2002). Daubeďs reference to Popper and testing may have been a factor leading to it becoming more difficult to have certain tort claims achieve entry to court but has had the unanticipated effect of creating admissibility problems for previously unchallenged forensic science, such as fingerprint evidence (Cole, 2001). Producing "purpose-built" definitions of science for legal contexts simply to block creation science has obvious negative implications for the broader public and policy appraisal of science. Aside from encouraging the incoherence noted above, it does little to encourage more informed assessments of the implications of science in society more generally or the day-to-day practices of science, and merely nurtures a fragile scientism unlikely to be sustained in the face of scientific disagreement and the energetic diversity of contemporary scientific practice.</page><page sequence="8">50 THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL Creation Science/Science and the Media Although not purporting to provide a comprehensive content analysis of media treatment of creation science disputes, a number of studies indicate that yet again the tendency appears for the essences of science and religion to become the currency of discussion ahead of more practical local/immediate issues. In particular, the media has displayed a tendency to portray creation science and science and religion issues by using familiar mythical tropes such as the "trial of Galileo" and the "Scopes trial" (Larson, 1997; Edmond and Mercer, 1999). For example, in analysis of the media treatment of the McLean trial, discussed in the last section, Marcel La Folíete (1983) noted the regular framing of media reports with Scopes imagery. These science myths, themselves frequently based on historical misunder- standings, are drawn upon to portray creation science disputes as part of a longstanding generic process of the battle between reason and superstition. In using such myths, the political particulars of given disputes, including the public status of science and various bodies of religious thought, are easily misrepre- sented. For instance, in relation to the Scopes trial, Gould (1999) has pointed out that the 1920s biology text(s) that were being promoted by Scopes support- ers contained numerous references to eugenics and theories of race that would today be unacceptable and even in their own time were controversial. Edward Larson's detailed history (Larson, 1997) of the Scopes trial also reveals the intricate play of US politics and public culture that helped elevate the dispute to take on public significance well beyond questions of science vs. religion. In the study of the media treatment of a "creation science" case, this time in Australia, Edmond and Mercer (1999) noted that Scopes was continually used as a mythical resource to frame media accounts. The case in question, like McLean , nevertheless possessed considerable differences and local legal signifi- cance, to sketch the details as briefly as possible. The case emerged from the efforts of the Australian Skeptics and an eminent Australian geologist to use the Australian Federal Trade Practices Act to restrict the capacity of a fringe religious figure to give public presentations to help raise funds for an expedition to survey what he alleged were the remains of Noah's Ark. The Skeptics also hoped this would become a test case to restrict the "educational" and commercial activities of organizations promoting other "fringe science" claims such as astrology and alternative health and an opportunity to reinforce the public image of the rationality of science. In practice, the trial ended up hinging on quite different more subtle issues concerning the appropriate scope of the Federal Trade Practices Act to cover religious activities and whether its application in matters of conflicting beliefs and ideologies would inhibit freedom of speech. Despite the way the case actually proceeded, the media persisted in treating the case as a "showdown" between science and religion and an opportunity to promote the notion that modern science was under threat from creation science. Below, I have provided three quotes where journalists drew on a</page><page sequence="9">DAVID MERCER 51 mythical treatment of the Scopes trial and used it as a resource to convey polarized images of science vs. religion: The standing-room-only crowd expected the Monkey Trial Mark II, a 1990s version of the 1925 Scopes "Monkey Trial." They wanted to see Charles Darwin and the Bible go one on one. (Dayton, 1997, p. 6) The creationist dispute has been raging ever since the infamous 'monkey trial' in Ten- nessee 72 years ago, at which John Scopes was convicted for teaching evolution. (Pockley, 1997a, p. 529) Sackville recalled how the Scopes trial was extended when the prosecutor, William Jennings Bryan, took the witness stand to defend the literal truth of the Bible. . . . (As loosely depicted in the 1960 Hollywood film Inherit the Wind , Frederick March portraying Bryan, in real life, was destroyed by defence attorney Clarence Darrow, played by Spencer Tracy, and died 2 days later.) (Pockley, 1997b, p. 149) The Scopes trial continues to appear as part of the popular culture of crea- tion science disputes. In a recent dispute over teaching biology in Kansas, a local Topeka theatre group organized the staging of the play, based on the Scopes trial Inherit the Wind , and the play gained considerable media attention (Biles, 2000). As Larson has noted, the play Inherit the Wind took considerable license with the facts of the case so as to project as powerfully as possible the irrationality of opponents to evolution; the play yet again had its own "cold war" political context (Larson, 1997). These brief examples obviously do not constitute a comprehensive over- view of the media treatment of creation science but they fit in well with some of the broader critiques of the tendency for the mass media to anchor its treatment of science in simplistic narratives that fail to provide a sense of the social context of science (Gregory and Miller, 1998). These examples are also consis- tent with the popular and legal discourse touched on in the two sections above, where creation science debates and science and religion considerations seem to invite enthusiastic forays into "folk epistemology" to derive the essences of science and religion. "Antiscience Studies" A similar example of creation science debates being used to nurture polarized essentialist images of science can be found in attacks on science studies following in the wake of the so-called "science wars." Probably the most widely known example of this style of attack can be found in the work of Norman Levitt in his Prometheus Bedevilled (Levitt, 1999). I will quote liberally from this text to help convey to the reader the passion with which these claims are made:</page><page sequence="10">52 THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL It is interesting, if dismaying, to note how far the attitudes and doctrines of the post- modern cultural left flatter the interests of creationists and similar groups on the cultural right (Levitt, 1999, p. 183) In reality, postmodern cultural anthropology is a bare inch away from being an outright ally of the creationist movement. Is it too alarmist to suggest as postmodern doctrine shifts in coming years, a syncretic alliance might develop between principled cultural relativists and fundamentalist anti-science? (Levitt, 1999, p. 186) Levitt's critique is echoed by scientists such as Barry Palevitz: In the perpetual skirmish between science and religion, biological evolution is a conten- tious batdeground. Despite a series of legal victories for science, which many thought or hoped would be the final nails in the coffin of creationism, hostilities still flare. Maybe iťs millennialism. Perhaps it reflects unease with modern science and technology. Vigor- ous antiscience rhetoric coming from the humanities in the guise of postmodernism, some of it antievolution in flavor, may be fueling the fire, footnotes removed from oriģnal quote] (Palevitz, 2003, p. 171) Palevitz also extends his "moral panic" into the broader intellectual terrain of debates about biological determinism, linking critics of biological determin- ism to creationists in their supposed shared fear of "honest objective inquiry." Perhaps the most pernicious message of creationists is this: If only we deny it, evolution will go away. If enough people are convinced, nature will follow suit. The radical post- modernists have a similar fantasy: If their objections to biological determinism (essen- tialism) are loud enough, perhaps genetic influences on human behavior will disappear. This kind of message should send shivers down the spine of anyone interested in honest objective inquiry. [Footnotes removed from orignal quote] (Palevitz, 2003, pp. 176-177) For Levitt, the threat of creation science is linked to promoting a model of science education where science studies need to be excluded: It hardly needs stating that the climate currendy prevailing in the science studies com- munity is openly hostile to anything resembling the conventional notion of scientific literacy. To these partisans, what the general public should know about science is how wrongheaded and deluded scientists are and how insupportable it is for scientists to claim to know what, in fact, they really do know. For the moment, I can recommend no better antidote to the pretensions of science studies than well-informed scorn. (Levitt, 1999, p. 189) What is interesting is that alongside their scorn for science studies is an ex- pressed desire of the need for the curriculum to teach science students some kind of philosophy of science, albeit one purpose-built to only celebrate science's fundamental progressive rationality:</page><page sequence="11">DAVID MERCER 53 We teach facts and principles in our science classes, but apparently not enough about the philosophical underpinnings of the scientific process and the way that scientists view the natural world. (Palevitz, 2003, p. 176) Levitt and Palevitz's wish is to save science from creation science (and sci- ence studies) by monopolizing, for scientists like themselves, the right to comment and shape curricula on matters to do with science and society. They hope to do this by picking and choosing from the philosophical perspectives in science studies they like but never engage in scholarly dialogue with the perspectives they dislike. Such an approach hardly represents good social science scholarship. But in practical terms, even with a version of academic science studies devoid of social constructivist and postmodern tendencies, Levitt and Palevitz's simplistic essentialist folk epistemology would still be unlikely to "solve" the challenges they perceive. They would still be left adjudicating the differences between scientists such as Gould and Dawkins, and philosophers (with limited sympathies for social constructionism) such as Ruse and Laudan. Their polemical approach leaves them poorly equipped to do this. Conclusion Scholarship in the field of science studies (broadly defined) over the last twenty to thirty years has provided numerous philosophical perspectives and historical and contemporary case studies of science and technology. Echoing my earlier discussion of the work of Brooke, it is in this diversity and care for empirical detail that there is potential to avoid the tendency for creation science debates to encourage unnecessary polarization of perspectives and confused intractable debate over epistemological "essentialisms." The diversity of perspectives offered by contemporary science studies does present some challenges for incorporation into the curriculum. There have been disagreements about what version of science studies should be adopted (Mathews, 1994), and some critics have suggested that the diversity of perspec- tives on offer means that the exercise should be abandoned (Shamos, 1995). The degree to which this diversity is an obstacle is nevertheless largely prefig- ured by perceptions that there is a need to have an essence of science taught in the curriculum, and ignorance, such as that displayed by Levitt and Palevitz, of how far many perspectives in science studies, across the relativist/realist continuum, have moved away from defining a single essence, ethos, or method of science. In a thoughtful discussion, John Rudolph reviews this question: It seems that much of the difficulty many see in incorporating the nature of science into the science curriculum resides in the particular manner in which the practice of science has been historically described. Such accounts have been concerned primarily with establishing some universal characterization of science into which the work of any given scientist in any discipline, past or present, might easily fit. This work has been motivated largely by the desire of scholars to provide a philosophical metascientific justification for the privileged place in society that science currendy enjoys ... a goal</page><page sequence="12">54 THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL that, in many ways, overreaches the more circumscribed goals of science education. [Footnotes removed from orignal quoté[ (Rudolph, 2000, p. 404) Rudolph notes two strategies that have been proposed in different contexts as ways to help overcome the lack of a consensus over a universal definition of science in science studies: (1) Try to abstract from competing views about the nature of sdence some more gen- eral lower-level statements about sdence from which educators may draw a consensus. This strategy, argues Rudolph, can encounter problems if all it means is the adoption of trivial and very general statements that can be "noted" and then not be integrated in a meaningful way into specific teaching contexts. (2) Allow students to engage with competing philosophical perspectives. Here, problems can be encountered on fairly pragmatic grounds: to engage in such an exercise normally presumes some degree of prior competence in science, which students simply may not have. This approach is also likely to be time consuming and begins to look like the promotion of science studies as a subject in its own right: a useful gesture, but some- thing that represents a significant move from the initial aim of arriving at the best way to incorporate science studies into not replacing science education. Rudolph suggests an alternative approach that emphasizes the investigation of science as "local practice." Rather than seek to first identify the ultimate universal goals of science, students could be encouraged to consider the cognitive goals, models, and methods of justification and argumentation of various scientific disciplines and clusters of disciplines. Students can begin to identify the different practices and cognitive styles manifest in various physical, chemical, and biological sciences. Insights from science studies can be used to help inform these discussions. Going beyond Rudolph, the approach he supports could be augmented by inviting discussion of the social impacts of various sciences, considering the aims of particular disciplines, the norms of practitioners and practical outcomes again at a more immediate practically grounded level (Albury, 1983; Roth, McGinn and Bowen,1996). Considerations of philosophical metanarra- tives surrounding the broader legitimacy of science, and the uses to which this legitimacy has and should be put, involves more specialist history, sociology, and philosophy of science: concerns better dealt with in an expanded role for science studies in the social science/humanities curriculum. Arguably, one of the current obstacles to a more informed philosophical discussion of the politics and ethics of science is the prevalence of naïve realist philosophies of science that are appended to science classes with very litde plausible link to the content of the sciences being taught. Ideally, if students have acquired a prior</page><page sequence="13">DAVID MERCER 55 clearer understanding of features of local scientific practice, this will provide them with a better starting point to develop a better appreciation of the intricacies of epistemology science and ethics (Milne and Taylor, 1998). The position I am advocating is compatible in many respects with some of the themes developed by Collins and Pinch in their popular science studies text The Golem (1993). In keeping with a body of literature that has investigated public perceptions of science in controversial areas (Irwin and Wynne, 1996), they observe that unsustainable metanarratives about the nature of science, apart from being historically and empirically unsustainable, can actually generate conflict by creating cognitive dissonance when experts, particularly in contro- versial settings, expose the slippage between the ideals of scientific practice and the practicalities and craft skills involved in scientific practice. These problems of public deconstruction of science have been a persistent theme hovering in the background of creation science debates. Because many creation science claims themselves are difficult to sustain empirically, it has been easier for creation science proponents to focus instead on exploiting the artificiality of ideal images of science so as to expose inconsistencies in mainstream scientific claims in biology. Holding evolutionary biology accountable to ideal canons of scientific method may leave biological claims whose cognitive and instrumental value is easy to justify according to canons of locally situated disciplinary practice open to unrealistic criticism. Critique of the social implications of such practices on the basis of such epistemological metanarratives is also likely to make little contact with the realities of science and public policy. Rather than being drawn into answering fundamental issues of epistemol- ogy in the science classroom, creation science and intelligent design could be more constructively framed as "local knowledge" containing some elements loosely associated with contemporary biology. Within this more pragmatic framework, it would be relatively easy to assess the aims, cognitive style, modes of justification, and general (lack of) instrumental value of such claims. It would be unlikely that such claims would warrant much time in the science curriculum. Broader religious /epistemological metanarratives associated with these claims would still be worth considering, but would be dealt with more construc- tively in the social science/humanities part of the curriculum. To be balanced, similar constraints could also be applied to assessing the more speculative biological determinisi and scientistic elements of claims made by scientists such as Dawkins. In all, if we are to capture the positive educational potentials of creation science debates, we need to reverse the trend for popular scientific discourse to become excessively preoccupied with producing simplistic folk epistemologies of science. These folk epistemologies often have at best tenuous links to academic science studies and tend to enhance confusion and polarized under- standings of science and religion. Discussion of epistemologies of science are valuable but are likely to be more fruitful when they take place in scholarly contexts where there is some sense of longer-standing debates in science studies</page><page sequence="14">56 THE EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL coupled with some prior-grounded appreciation of science as practice. En- gagement in endless battles over folk epistemologies of science, such as those documented here, should not be allowed to direct energy in popular scientific discourse and science education away from engagement in the more important immediate project of encouraging a better appreciation of the actual practices of the sciences and their immediate social implications.
