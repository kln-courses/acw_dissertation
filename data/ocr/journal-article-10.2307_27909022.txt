<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORD STUDIES IN RABBINIC HEBREW IN MEMORY OF S. LIEBERMAN Herbert W. Basser Queen's University Kingston, Canada Philologists are often intrigued by the peculiar usages of midrashic Hebrew. Some terms, which have established connotations in and apart from midrashic literature, at times have meanings very different from their popu lar connotations. Fortunately, students of midrashic literature now are able to avail themselves of the indispensible lexicographical notes published by Saul Lieberman. He developed sound philological methods which deserve to be studied, practiced, and occasionally refined. It is in honor of his monu mental contributions and of his sainted memory that I offer the following observations concerning some peculiar usages in midrash. . moto One of Professor Lieberman's best known quips is to the effect that while nonsense is always nonsense, the history of nonsense is very significant. We will therefore discuss the history of "nonsense." Translators have generally translated the word mo? as "foolishness" or "nonsense." The history of this usage is quite significant, for the term has been used in midrash in a more particular way, although commentators and translators have generally over looked this distinctive meaning. A peculiar usage occurs in a passage in Gen esis Rabba 11:7. The story relates that during a debate between a Christian and a rabbi, the rabbi had to explain why Adam and all subsequent human males had not been born circumcised.1 In accordance with the proper form for polemical stories, the author states that the rabbi answered the query by asking a question, "Why did he, the Christian, shave the head hair but not the beard hair?" The Christian responded that it grew about him in mcKD. Trans lators and commentators have usually rendered this term as "foolishness," which makes little sense. The generally excellent commentary, Ez Yosef Umatnot Kehunah, com posed by Enoch Zundel (19 c), claimed that it meant the days of youth when hair grows thickly and rapidly. Apparently, this comment is derived from a midrash found in Genesis Rabbah 89:9, where nafi is explained as: 1 Gen. R. 11:7 identifies the rabbi as Hoshaya. Pesikta Rabbati 23 identifies him as Rabbi (Judah the Prince). The same question was posed to Jews by Origen (see N. R. M. deLange, Origen and the Jews [Cambridge, 1976], pp. 92, 189 n. 14, n. 15) and by Justin (Dialogue with Trypho, ch. 19).</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 28 (1987) 68 Basser: Word Studies , K?ittmna.2 Zundel believed that ivi was defined by mo? so that both referred to days of youth.3 But moo meaning "youth" is unattested and lacks philological evidence. The real intent of Genesis Rabbah 89:9 is to say that refers to stimulating the evil sexual urge (*n:r tot), and this is indeed what mo? might mean, naj) is then understood to be derived from ]V"DD, "one who transgresses." The phrase refers to the biblical Joseph who was jailed on an attempted rape charge. In Genesis Rabbah 11:7, as well as 89:9, mo? is a euphemism referring to sexual matters. Here, the root meaning is not "foolishness" but "irregular ity." The lexicons are familiar with the root DIE having a meaning of "irregular and incomplete."4 This meaning is not noted under reiB? or moo. It should be so noted. This meaning is substantiated by the Syraic version of the Didascalia Apostolorum. It records that Christian pietists did not wear sexually attractive garments; they shaved their heads because of RmcM? and they did not trim their beards. The gist of the Syriac runs, "Also you shall not wear shoes on your feet which were designed to arouse Rrncn? (var. Rnvcx?) .. .You shall not allow the hair of your head to grow long.. .and you must not injure the edges of your beard" (Codex Harris 4a). The description fits the Christian in Genesis Rabbah 11:7. niDO in our midrash means exactly what it does in the Syriac passage just cited, "irregularity" with reference to matters which give offense, usually with a sexual connotation. It is best translated as "shame."5 The rabbi told the Christian that any object which gives offense should be removed. This accords with the Christian doctrine, "If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."6 The rabbi then proceeded to build upon the root meaning of moo, "irregular and incomplete." In this way he justified the notion that man had to complete himself through the act of circumcision.7 The author of the story follows the set form for relating polemic victories by noting that the rabbi justified rabbinic practice in terms acceptable to his opponent's reli 2 Cf. Rashi to Gen 41:12; for the sense of (?&gt;13?0 see H. Yalon, Studies in the Hebrew Language (Jerusalem, 1971), p. 151. 3 He seems to have used this midrash to connect the common meaning of "youth," to the sense of (moo) 7VSW. 4 E.g., see M. Jastrow's Dictionary of the Tar gumim etc., s.v. OTO (II). 5 Note that the Targum renders DK? of Ezek 16:57; 28:24; and 28:26 by . 6 See Matthew 5:29-30 and 18:8-9. Also Mark 9:43-47. 7 See my preliminary discussion of this passage in H. Basser, "The meaning of shtuth, Gen. R. 11 in reference to MT 5:29-30 and 18:8-9," NTS 31 (1985), p. 150.</page><page sequence="3">Hebrew Studies 28 (1987) 69 Basser: Word Studies gious tastes.8 To appreciate the story one has to know that niDt? can mean "offensive," "irregular and incomplete."9 . pro A more intricate problem in the field of rabbinic philology concerns the word pre. Lieberman himself noted the problem briefly.10 Generally, the Palestinian midrashim and targumim equate pre with "expecting,"11 "wait ing,"12 "delaying,"13 and "holding back."14 Lieberman suggested that the term could also be equated with the Syriac p?ron.15 That is, he briefly noted that pre could refer to saintly and pious people. We will fully and con clusively demonstrate this. Both "pon and pre are perfectly good rabbinic terms to describe one who restrains his passions, conquers his urges, and refrains from sin. While it has been widely noted that Avot 1:1, "Be D*nra in rendering judgements," means one ought to hold oneself back from rendering decisions immediately, apart from Lieberman's note it has not been observed that pre can refer to self-denial in indulging one's passions, pre in Tosefta Shabbat 7 refers to pious people.16 This passage reads: You will not find amongst the major cities people who were more pre than the Sodomites. For we find that Lot inspected everywhere but did not find any place as pno as Sodom... Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says that you will not find amongst the gentiles any nation more pno than the Amontes. For we find that they had faith in the Holy One, blessed be He, so that when they were exiled to Africa the divinity gave them a land as nice as their own. And Scrip ture refers to the Land of Israel by their name. 8 See further . 46. 9 From this fundamental meaning is derived its common usage, "foolishness," "nonsense." 10 See S. Lieberman, Tosefta Kifshutah Moed 3 (Shabbat), New York, 1962, p. 105. 11 E.g., see Job 17:15, see also Targum to Psalms 52:11; 56:7; 69:21; 119:93; 130:5. 12 See Job 32:4. 13 Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Gen 2:25 understood ?tOEDrv as if from ("delay") and uses a form of jno. 14 See Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Num 15:23 and to Leviticus 24:12. See also Seder Eliahu Rabba ch. 2 ""pton (=wait, ) one hour before the arrival of the meal time." 15 Lieberman (Shabbat, 105) refers the reader to the Syriac-English Dictionary of Payne-Smith, p. 1330, s.v. hskh. 16 Tosefta, ed. Zuckermandel, Jerusalem, 1970, p. 119.</page><page sequence="4">Hebrew Studies 28 (1987) 70 Basser: Word Studies It is quite surprising to hear these praises of people whose communal morality is regarded as despicable. But Genesis Rabba 40:17 explains that these praiseworthy descriptions are meant to be relative. If these evil people were ?he best of the gentiles, we might well imagine how utterly despicable the others were. This clarifying midrash replaces pno by ns\ "the best," and the popular reading has datoti to explain that these people were the crrra among the gentiles. This reading apparently suggests that they were the upper class, but such a reading is hardly appropriate. The Datori variants listed for Genesis Rabba 40:17 provide .17 I take this to be the correct reading because it can be demonstrated that Cp n) -pon refers to pious people, i.e., D'Ton. This demonstration occurs in Genesis Rabba 26:6. Here again the popular reading is and again the variants provide DOlon.18 However, we also find here, listed among the variants, the reading D'Ton.19 In this passage as well, the original reading must be DOlon. A knowledgeable scribe glossed DOion with DTon, its equivalent. It appears that pre means "pon which means . These terms refer to those who fear Heaven and fear sin.20 Lieberman's suggestion that cnra and refer to people who refrain from succumbing to their passions can be verified further. The Hav-dallah prayer in the Amidah for Saturday nights reads " from every sin and pure from every transgression and cleaving to the fear of You." There are also biblical antecedants for this usage of "pon.21 But only in rabbinic Hebrew do we find that one who refrained from transgressing was a fearer of sin and a pre. Sifre Deuteronomy apparently duplicates an interpretation of Deut 32:33, which reads D'ans ?mi Dr DTn non.22 The first interpretation groups together DTon and the "fearers of Heaven." The near duplicate groups together D'ira and the "fearers of sin."23 This parallelism reminds one of the parallel phrases in M. Avot 2:5, "One untutored is not a fearer of 17 Bereshith Kabbah, ed. Theodor-Albeck, 2nd ed. Jerusalem, 1965, p. 394. 18 Bereshith Rabbah, ed. Theodor-Albeck, p. 262. 19 was needlessly marked by the editors with a "?". 20 ""pon also has the connotation of "restraint to be merciful." Thus we find the expression "pon ] in Targum to Jeremiah 3:11. The Arukh (s.v. "|0 ) renders D?TDTi "[ to mean "Scripture took pity." 21 See Gen 20:6, Ps 19:14. 22 Ed.

Future lexicons should add pre, "a pious person." in. ntrpO3K Quite often the sense of a passage is revealed by its context but sometimes the context obscures the true sense. In rare cases Saul Lieberman was misled by the apparent context of passages and so rendered words according to what he believed had to be their true senses. In one case he considered a midrash: Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai explained Numbers 10:33, "And the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord travelled before them." "AND the Ark of the Covenant" was specifically said as a metaphor. To what can the matter be compared? To an ncrp'DK (var. in London MS: no^CMK) who would go before his troops to pre pare the camp site. So did the Shekina go before Israel and prepare their camp site 25 A second midrash is similar to the above but contains the reading "to a "nojp who goes before the nations, three days in advance to prepare the way for them."26 In his discussion of these passages, Lieberman noted the suggeston of Joseph Perles, for whom the correct reading was no'p'Ml and reflected the Latin antecessor.21 The Greek equivalent of antecessor is a e and apparently accounts for the corrupt reading in the second version, mojp. The meaning of the word is "scout," which fits the context of the midrash. God acted like a scout in leading his people through the desert. However, Lieberman claimed that the original reading was in fact ^ and reflect ed the Greek a e , i.e., quartermaster. Lieberman rejected, as did 24 See Arukh Completimi, Vienna 1926, s.v. " . There A. Kohut discusses the readings of a passage found in the printed editions of M. Sotan 9:15, "Fear of sin leads to (piety)." Perhaps one can de tect a difference between the "one who fears sin" and the . The former desists from doing evil deeds while the latter goes one step further and also does very righteous deeds. 25 Sifre Numbers 78, pis. 6. This reading follows the text of M. Kahana, Prolegomenon Towards a New Edition of Sifre Numbers, unpublished dissertation at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, 1982, p. 169. The midrashic explanation is derived from an apparent extra waw ("and") in Numbers 10:33, which seemed to indicate that God travelled before the Israelites with the ark as his throne. 26 Sifre Zuta to Numbers 10:33. This passage ends with a citation from Deut 1:33, "who goes before you...with fire at night to show you the way." It would apear that this midrash is related to the Mekhilta midrashim (see further ns. 30-31) which speak of someone carrying a lantern at night. 27 S. Lieberman, "Roman Legal Institutions," JQR 35-36 (1944-46), p. 5 (where the Greek terms above are also listed). Lieberman cites Perles as Joseph Perles, MGWJ 37, p. 318 (Perles' article is in Byzan tinische Zeitschrift 10, p. 304).</page><page sequence="6">Hebrew Studies 28 (1987) 72 Basser: Word Studies Perles, the idea that the midrashim were talking about the antikaisar, the vic eroy (the usual sense of "lO'p^MK), since it was not his duty to scout territory for camp sites. However, one might still think these explanations are not so self-evident. Usually, midrashists did not compare God to anyone less than a king. Although Scripture does attribute scouting activity to God, would the Rabbis have accepted that God's position in the Israelite camp was that of quartermaster? Further reflection and research can resolve this issue. Midrash often claims that Scripture is using metaphoric language when scriptural language presents personifications or conceptual difficulties. Midrash then offers suit able metaphors to solve the difficulties. An examination of midrashim, simi lar to the above, will show us that the Rabbis were troubled that Scripture portrayed God, the King of Kings, as a scout. They resolved this difficulty by picturing a viceroy or king28 who loves his troops so much that he personally neglects the honor of his office to go before his troops. In his commentary, Rabbenu Hillel indeed explained our word to refer to the viceroy 29 Two other midrashim validate our understanding of this metaphor. These midrashim explain Exod 13:21, which tells how God led the Israelites. Rabbi Yosi the Galilean said that had Scripture not written it, it would be im possible to give such a description. (What was Scripture's purpose?) It is like the father who holds the lantern before his children and like the master who holds the lantern before his slave.30 The full import of these statements is given in another version: How is it possible to say this! Surely Scripture has stated to the contrary, "Do I not fill the heavens and the earth??saith the Lord." .. .What is to be understood by Scripture's [demeaning] statement, "And the Lord went before them by day..."? Rabbi gave the following explanation. Antoninus would judge on the platform until it turned dark and his children would wait with him as it turned dark. When he would leave the platform he would take the lantern and provide light for his children... "Thus do I inform you of my love for my children so that you are obliged to treat them respectfully." Similarly did the Holy One, blessed be He, inform the gentiles of the world of his love for Israel; namely, by going personally before them, so that they [the gentiles] would be obliged to treat them respectfully.31 28 It appears some Jews called the caesar "viceroy" once the Roman emperors had been expelled. 29 See his commentary to Sifre Numbers 78, pis. 6 (cited by Kahana, op cit.). "lO'p'CMR reflects Gk. a a. \aa while ^ may reflect consul and not the lower-ranked censor. For this latter point I am indebted to Harry Fox, who is preparing for publication a full discussion of this passage in a paper dealing with traditions concerning the Ark of the Covenant 30 Mechilta Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai to Exod 13:21. 31 Mechilta Rabbi Yishmael to Exodus 13:21. "p?nn in this passage means "to wait until dark." A. J.

Thus no'p'DR, or more correctly ' ' ?, refers, as it usually does, to the anticaesar or viceroy. The Rabbis learned from the image of Scripture that while it is beneath the dignity of God to serve his beloved subjects, he did so anyway. If "icrp'tMK simply re ferred to the quartermaster of an army, the whole poignency of the metaphor would be lost. In this case, the apparent context of a passage misled first-rate philologists. IV. *p0 Another instance where the apparent context blurred the sense of a word can be found in Lieberman's review of M. Kasher's Torah Shlemah, Exo dus?1 In his review of this work, Lieberman discussed a midrashic comment which occurs in Tanhuma Shemot 15. The midrash explains Exod 3:2, "And he saw and behold the bush, burning with fire, but the bush was not con sumed": From here the Rabbis learned that heavenly fire gives off shoots ( ^ ) and burns (n?m0), while it is not consumed and it is black. Lieberman had difficulty understanding the relationship between "burning" ( ? ) and "sprouting plant shoots" (]'Dblb). He referred his readers to a variant reading, "blossoming" (pitali) and "smelting" (rema). This read ing demonstrated that corruptions had entered the texts. On the basis of the Fragmentary Targum to Exod 3:2, "the bush was D'CHD and not burning," Lieberman construed Tanhuma to have meant that the bush was blossoming in the fire. He reconstructed Tanhuma's nsmto or remx to be misreadings of nsrno, which also means "to blossom and bring forth fruit."33 Thus Lieberman reasoned that the nature of heavenly fire is such that it permits blossoming but not consumption. According to Lieberman, this reconstruc tion, nanoi paitaft, should now be translated as a doublet, "blooms and blossoms." in Scripture. I see no difference here in this regard. The midrashim address the question of God's apparent low position in the Israelite camp rather than the question of anthropomorphism in Scripture. The traditions recorded in the Mechilta are ancient Mechilta Rabbi Shimon to Exod 13:21, like the Greek Book of Baruch (end), joins Isa 40:4 and Exod 13:21 to show how God flattened Israel's path to lead them by the light of his Glory. 32 JQR N.S. 35-36 (1944-1946) pp. 318ff. 33 Ibid. p. 319, n. 16. Lieberman correctly notes *]" = 2 - 2 (metathesis and labial substitution).</page><page sequence="8">Hebrew Studies 28 (1987) 74 Basser: Word Studies But biblical and rabbinic Hebrew has a shared vocabulary for "blossom ing" and "shining." One has only to think of the rabbinic Hebrew term for sunrise, the "shining of the sun" - nonn pn. This does not mean the "blossoming of the sun" but the "shining of the sun." S. Morag and others have already demonstrated how words like ?ivos (usually "giving off sprouts") have the sense of "shining."34 Thus the Fragmentary Targum really says the "bush was shining but not burning." Consequently, we read Tanhuma Shemot with Lieberman ranneri (ptoi1?) pW? rftflo but, unlike him, render this "radiating and shining."35 Lieberman noted that the context had to do with bushes. He therefore transferred the vocabulary in the direction of blossoming. However, the true import of the passage is to describe a fire which, according to Exod 3:2, allowed "un, i.e., "glowing," "giving out rays," in daylight. The Rabbis contrasted this to earthly fire, which does burn objects but does not glow in daylight or give out rays. Lieberman's emenda tion of the passage is compelling although his rendering of the emendation is not. Even in his errors there is much truth. Our lexicons can now add, : "shine, glow."36 v. oran Another philological problem addressed by Lieberman is the meaning of orvon in M. Yadaim 4:6.37 The history of interpretation of this term in rab binic literature is well documented in commentaries, lexicons, and learned journals.38 This passage concerns a group of Sadducees who criticized the 34 See S. Morag, "( \ &gt; crtrm) VTll " 7ar?iz 33 (1963-64), pp. 140-148. And see S, Morag, "(rf7:6 wbnr?) pn rnno mwer TYirWz 41 (1971-1972) p. 4, n. 14. 35 I.e., "The bush was glowing and shining because of the (heavenly) fire (?tO). And (because of the na ture of this fire) it was not consumed." The Rabbis in the Tanhuma passage declared that the heavenly fire had to be black. The reason for this could only be because they understood that although the bush was glowing in the sunlight it was nonetheless visibly shining. Hence it is clear that it is speaking of the bush glowing rather than blossoming. 36 Yet, it would be erroneous to think that Lieberman was anxious to propose textual emendations. He was not. He maintained the reading ]*2 WTD (literally, "stomach between her teeth") rather than accept an emendation (S. Lieberman, Josef ta Kifshutah, Nashim 6 [Ketubot], New York, 1967, p. 197, n. 39.). Although he did not appear to explain the expression precisely, E. Z. Melamed showed that the readings were correct and that the expression referred to someone who was obviously pregnant (the stomach having been lowered into "the birth canal" = teeth). See E. Z. Melamed, "Euphemism and scribal circumlocutions in Talmudic literature," Benjamin de Vries Memorial Volume, ed. E. . Melamed, 1968, p. 138. 37 S.

They said that the Pharisees treated their Scriptures as something which, upon contact, could cause hands to transfer a level of ritual impurity. On the other hand they did not treat the scrolls of orvon as such an object. What were these scrolls of orvon? Lieberman upheld the interpretation of Hai Gaon; namely, orvon refers to Homer.39 According to Lieberman, the Sadducees were offended because the Pharisees did not accord Scriptures the same respect they accorded Homer. He understood their point to be that the Sadducees were zealous for the honor of the Torah. However, Maimonides found a pun in the word. He believed referred to anti-Pharisaic works and derived the word from a root which expressed the wish that such works should be obliterated.40 Elsewhere he identified these works as books of minim (heretics).41 Whatever the truth is concerning these notions, one wonders how Maimonides could have thought that the Sadducees referred to their own works as books which should be obliterated. To this implicit challenge, Maimonides responded that the Rabbis did not record these words verbatim but slightly changed the original in order to suggest undesirable conditions 42 I interpret this Mishnah passage differently than what appears above. The point is to show that the Sadducees wanted to indicate that the Pharisees accorded more respect to the Samaritan Torah (which did not contaminate the hands) than they did to their own Pharisaic version. That is, the Sadducees understood the Pharisaic decree pronouncing that touching Pharisaic Scrip tures "contaminated the hands" to be a sign of disrespect. Following Azariah de Rossi, I would argue that orvon is actually ? , "fool."43 However, unlike de Rossi, I have noted that this term is the usual appelation of Samaritans in Jewish Hellenistic literature and translates 39 See the commentary of Hai Gaon (in the printed edition of the Wilna Talmud) to M. Yadaim 4:6. The Gaon apparently read . However, loan words which derive from Greek often dissimilate. Thus Greek ? becomes Hebrew DTD**! I accept the reading as original and deriving from the Greek o ^. Other Mishnah texts read here ETVDfT (final mem) and this appears to have been Maimonides' reading (see n. 41 below). See Lieberman, Hellenism, p. 106, n. 39 for a list of variants in the manuscript readings. 40 See the commentary of the Rosh on the same page as that of Hai Gaon (n. 40 above). Rosh explains Maimonides' reasoning as found in Maimonides' Commentary to the Mishnah (Yadaim 4:6) by claiming that DTDH is to be taken as \wb. In DTOH (or , i.e., hufal) Maimonides appears to see a conflation of two roots, since he explains that one wishes these books to be cast aside (likely from , cf. Exod 14:16) and removed (likely from DTI, cf. Exod 29:27). 41 Mishneh Torah, Avot Hatume'ot 9:11. Also, see Zeitlin's query: A. M. Honeyman, "A Tannaitic term for Christians," JQR N.S. 38 (1947-48), p. 155. 42 The device is discussed in H.

Zunz, Wilna, 1863-66, p. 70f.</page><page sequence="10">Hebrew Studies 28 (1987) 76 Basser: Word Studies Hebrew "fool" or "knave."44 Our Mishnah passage tells us that the Sad ducees mistakingly believed that the Pharisees accorded "books of orron" (i.e., Samaritan Scriptures) a high degree of respect. Does our passage indi cate that the Sadducees despised the Samaritans and referred to them as "foolish"? Perhaps not. When we look at the passage as a whole we perceive that this story has been retold in an artistic fashion to suit the classic form of the polemic story. According to the story, Yochanan ben Zakkai responded to his opponent's question by asking why the "non ("ass") does not contaminate. The Sadducees understood that ass bones deserved no respect as they could be used for utensils. However, Sadducean priestly bones, like those of Yochanan the High Priest, do contaminate, lest one treat them disrespectfully. Thus, even according to Sadducean notions of contamination, it was logical that the Pharisees accord such a respectful status to their version of the Torah (by declaring that it contaminates the hands) but not to the Samaritan version. It will be recalled that in our discussion of mDE) it was pointed out that the rabbi's question provoked the idea that rabbinic laws are based on under standings that should be acceptable to an opponent.45 This is the standard form for polemic stories in rabbinic literature. In the case of rncxo, the sense of the word moved from being a euphemism for something sexually arousing to being a term for something irregular and incomplete. The Mishnah pas sage under discussion here centers around the word . Whatever is is deemed to transfer contamination. But the Mishnah passage is presented in a more intricate fashion. The question of the Sadducee is also turned against him. The question contains the word orron to refer to the Samaritan Torah, so that this Scripture can then be compared to the bones of a non, an ass. The onomatopoeia create the comparison. We must not think that the Sadducees necessarily used ? in their query. The teller of the story has a definite artistic ploy in mind by using this term. The question of the Sadducee and the answer of the rabbi are bound together into a tight "argument" by using a sound similarity. 44 E.g., see Ben Sira 50:25. The Hebrew reads (?3?3 ) ta] na and the Greek reads ? $? The reference is to the Samaritans. See T. Gaster's entry s.v. "Samaritans" in the Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible where he states that "foolish" is the normal designation of Samaritans in Hellenistic Jewish literature. B. Sanh?drin 21b refers to them as "idiots." See also H. Basser, "The Development of the Pharisaic Idea of Law as Sacred Cosmos," JSJ 16 (1985), p. 109, n. 16; and H. Basser, "The Rabbinic Citations in Wacholder's Dawn of Qumran," RQ 11 (1984), p. 556, n. 11. 45 This standard form of "apologetic-polemic" occurs with slight modification in the Gospels. Matthew 12:1-4 (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5), Matthew 22:15-22 (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:19-26), and in many other places the form is used whereby an opponent is silenced by a question which points out that the opponent is wrong according to his own theology. The Gospels describe how the Pharisees understood this form of polemic, and yet could not turn it to their own advantage in disputes with Jesus. See Matthew 21:23-27 (Mark 11:27-33).</page><page sequence="11">Hebrew Studies 28 (1987) 77 Basser: Word Studies Moreover, the connection between the Pharisaic Torah and the bones of the High Priest is also highlighted by using names in the story which have roots denoting "that which is beloved of God." The name of the Pharisee, Yochanan ben Zakkai, and the name of the Sadducee High Priest, Yochanan, mean "beloved of God," and the Pharisaic version of the Torah is said to be "beloved." On the other hand, the mon (ass) is not beloved and neither is the Torah version of the ? (foolish Samaritans). What is beloved may defile, what is not beloved will not defile. The notion is justified in terms acceptable to Sadducean religious tastes. The Samaritan Torah is nothing but the value of an ass bone. Although the story has been told artfully in the form required to tell such stories, the historicity of the story may well be factual. The author will have taken some liberty in retelling the story in its artistic form. The Sadducees probably said (in fact) "the Samaritan Torahs," and not orron nao. While I might occasionally take issue with Lieberman's explanation of a certain word, I never cease to stand in awe at the genius with which he demonstrated the ongoing process of deciphering common words with rare meanings. Lieberman's contribution in this area was unique. Responsible institutions which teach graduate courses in Hebrew would do well to train students in the field of Hebrew linguistics. No greater tribute could be paid to Professor Saul Lieberman, whose passing has left us, for the moment, with neither viceroy nor scout to light the way.</page></plain_text>
