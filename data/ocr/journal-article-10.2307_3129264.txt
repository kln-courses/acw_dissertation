<plain_text><page sequence="1">Diversity* GUSTAV BERGMANN In the life of the intellect advances alternate with periods of con- solidation, or perplexity, or even retreat. For me, the last two years have been a time of many perplexities. Of some of these I shall talk to you. For I am convinced that a man is most likely to be worth listening to when he talks about what is, or recently has been, on his mind. The so-called propositions of arithmetic are not what they seem. '2 + 3 = 5,' for instance, is not a truth grounded ontologically in the way the world is but a rule, to be looked at anthropologically, as one of the rules one adopts, in some sense of 'rule' and 'adopt,' when one adopts a way of words and thereby, presumably, a way of life. This is the main thesis of Wittgenstein's Remarks on the Founda- tions of Mathematics. Four years ago I read this book for the first time, very closely. Having come to it with some inkling of its author's later thought, I was not too surprised. Yet I was shocked by the stark absurdity of its main thesis, so shocked that I then and there conceived the plan of showing accurately and in detail why it was absurd as well as how Wittgenstein had come to embrace it. But some work in prog- ress had to be finished first. Two years ago, when this work was out of the way and I had turned to the execution of the plan, I soon saw, again without surprise, that I could not do what I wanted to do with- out asking and answering on my own account, systematically rather than critically, the fundamental questions of the ontology of arithmetic. What is a class? Do classes exist? Exactly what is the difference, on which I had insisted for quite some time, between literal sameness on the one hand and Leibniz-Russell identity on the other? And so on, and so on. My answers have not changed as a result of this re-examina- tion. Yet I ran into difficulties, some of which I had not even seen before. Some others I had seen but pushed aside. Now they all stared *Presidential address delivered before the Sixty-Sixth Annual Meeting of the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association in St. Louis, Mis- souri, May 3, 1968. 21</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION me in the face, became one of the two sources of my recent perplexity. The other is less specific. As a man grows older, if he is a philosopher fortunate enough to have had a few able students, there comes a time when some among them turn into his severest critics. For me this time has come. Even so, we still have much in common. We are all dedicated to ontology. We share the two crucial beliefs that there are both particulars and uni- versals and that the entity in the act which I call a thought is a simple non-relational character. The issue between us is merely one of more or less. They think that my ontology is a jungle. I think that theirs is a desert. They think that my concern, which for this very reason they judge to be excessive, with phenomenology in general and with the unity and intentionality of thought in particular, has caused me to give ontological status outside of minds to what is merely in our thoughts but not in their intentions. At first I was not disturbed. Eventually I realized that I did not know how to defend myself against this charge. All I could do was to ask them how they knew that the negation or conjunction I am sometimes presented with are in my thought rather than where I find them, in its intention. It seemed that we had come to the limits of argument. Since we were still so close that perplexed me. Then things got worse. I discovered that I could not ground cardinal arithmetic as I believe it must be grounded, in existing classes, without adding still another subsistent and still another ontological principle. Yet I could easily imagine how my friendly critics would react. They would argue, only too plausibly, alas, that these additions, being patently ad hoc, also discredited the rest, or most of the rest, of my already bulging ontological inventory. At this point I felt very vulnerable. After a while I succeeded in convincing at least myself that we had indeed reached the limits of argument and that therefore I had no choice but either to persist in my ways or to fall silent. That helped me to regain my composure. The new entity is diversity. The new principle is stronger than the so-called axiom of choice or selection. So I call it the principle of selec- tion. This entity and this principle I want to present to you. Naturally that requires some preparation. We must first cast a quick glance at the world into which they are introduced, and, in particular, at those of its features to which may friendly critics object. In this world of mine, there are things, there are facts, and there are subsistents. All things are simple; i.e., none has another as a con- stituent. Only facts, or, synonymously, complexes, have constituents which are things. Things are either particulars or universals; if the 22</page><page sequence="3">DIVERSITY latter, either characters or relations of the several types. Green, for instance, is a character of the first type; color, one of the second. The musical intervals, second, third, fourth, and so on, are relations among pitches and therefore of the second type; higher-in-pitch, which they and nothing else exemplify, is a character of the third type; and so on. When presented with a thing, I am also presented with its type. This is a phenomenological claim. So I would not know how to argue for it. What is presented exists. This I take to be part of the very idea of ontology. So I call it a principle. By this principle, the several types, or, as I shall also call them, forms, all exist. Forms are one kind of subsistent. A subsistent which is not a form is a tie or nexus. Among the latter, exemplification stands out. Exemplification, or, perhaps, exemplifications, ties the appropriate number of things of the appro- priate types into atomic facts. A particular exemplifying green is one example; green exemplifying color is another. Facts, too, have forms. Forms, however, unlike facts, do not, as we shall see, have constituents. I have already gone as far as the friendly critics will follow. Things, facts, and either exemplification or some substitute for it they accept. About forms they are rather casual. All the rest of my inventory they reject. I turn next to what they consider my most gratuitous invention. Whatever is presented exists. What, then, is presented? At this point my phenomenological preoccupation shows perhaps most con- spicuously. We are presented with all the intentions of all our acts, not just of perceiving or believing, but of whatever species. Even what I disbelieve presents itself to me as existent. For how otherwise, I ask out of the same preoccupation, would I know what it meant to exist? Yet the overflow must be controlled. This is done by the two modes, actuality and potentiality. Exemplification, as one usually says, either does or does not connect the potential constituents of a fact. If it does, then, as one usually says, there is a fact; if it doesn't, there is nothing. I say instead that there is always a fact, either actual or potential; add- ing, first, that a potential fact has an ontological status all its own, and, second, that the mode of a fact is never presented to us. Notice the limitation to facts. On the side of the intention, things, for instance, being simple, are neither actual nor potential. Only for complexes does the notion of potentiality make sense. On the side of the act, when a thing is presented to me, so is not only its form but also the circum- stance that the latter is "in" the former. Notice, too, the family resem- blance between the two modes on the one hand and, on the other, Frege's True and False, which, like the critics, I reject. Thus I must 23</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION argue, and, of course, have argued that there are also differences which make the difference between success and failure. In a well-tempered ontology every entity or feature must earn its way by doing at least one job no other can do. The two modes, which of course are features rather than entities, do three such jobs. What is the intention of a thought which intends what, as one usually says, is not there? If there are potential facts, an answer is at hand. If there were none, I would have to hold, as Brentano did and as some of my critics do, that thought is "intrinsically relational," which to me is a contradiction in terms. This is the first job. The second is closely related to it. With the modes, I believe, one can give a realistic account of perception. Without them, one can't. A belief, in my world, is itself a fact and thus itself either actual or potential. Suppose it is actual. Then it will be true if and only if what the thought in it intends is actual. A disbelief, correspondingly, if actual, will be true if and only if the intention of the thought in it is potential; and so on. In general, the nature of truth is correspondence. This truism no realist may gainsay. Yet it is also a truism that the only criterion for truth we have is coher- ence. That much, alas, we must grant to the idealists and their heirs, the pragmatists. The two modes of fact, by being forever withdrawn from what is presented to us, permit us to reconcile the two truisms. This is the third job they do. But, then, how can this withdrawal be reconciled with another part of my vision, concerning the categorial, the analytic, and the a priori, which I have long pursued and am not prepared to abandon? The categorial, the analytic, and the a priori are, in descending order, the three levels of necessity, or, what amounts to the same, of possibility and impossibility. For one particular to exemplify another is categorially impossible. To be potential without being actual and to be categorially possible is one and the same. Of this level more presently. Turn to the analytic. Peter's being either blond or not blond is analytic. What is analytic must be actual. Yet, if I am right, then not even the actuality of this very special fact, Peter's being either blond or not blond, is ever presented to us. How, then, do I know that it is analytic? That spots the apparent difficulty of reconciling the two modes with the three levels. I begin by proposing another ontologization. The connectives, including negation, stand for subsistents which are nexus; and these nexus, unlike the modes, are presented to us. A connective, as I here speak, is thus not a word but an entity. Take now the familiar truth tables and ontologize them, too, by replacing True and False with "actual" and "potential." So modified, the tables stand for connec- 24</page><page sequence="5">DIVERSITY tions between the connectives on the one hand and the two modes on the other. Hence these connections themselves are not presented to us as either actual or potential. What, then, does it mean to say that Peter's being either blond or not blond is a truth-table tautology and therefore analytic? That spots the apparent difficulty even more sharply. I resolve it by pointing out that if we assign these connections and, with them, all sentential tautologies to actuality, then we can assign each of our intentions to either actuality or potentiality so that they cohere; i.e., we can so assign each of them to one and only one of the two modes that, if P is assigned to actuality and "If P then Q" is a tautology, then Q is also assigned to actuality. And so on. I have limited myself to the sentential tautologies. But the same can be done for every- thing I want to call analytic. Are the connectives really presented to us? I, for one, am not pre- pared to argue very strenuously that I am clearly and distinctly pre- sented with each of the two hundred fifty-six ternary ones. But I have no doubt about negation and binary conjunction. They are continu- ously presented to us in perception. In ontology, though not of course in descriptive phenomenology, that suffices. All the rest, in ontology, is quite properly schematic. Yet the differences between the connectives and exemplification remain vast. The latter constitutes the modes; the former merely transmit them. Accordingly, every binary connective ties any two facts into a third; every ternary one, if there be such, any three into a fourth; and so on. The ontological status of such ties surely is weak, yet their ontologization does not, as you see, obliterate those vast differences. If anything, it helps to bring them out. I just concluded from a principle to which I have already appealed, that, since I am sometimes presented with them, the connectives exist. There is still another principle which forces their ontologization. A mere collection of entities is not as such a further entity. If you accept this as a principle and suppose that, say, a conjunction is merely a collection of two facts rather than a third into which these two have been tied by a connective, then you will see that, when presented with a conjunction, you would not be presented with an existent. Thus the first principle would be violated. The relevance of the second for the class issue is clear, I trust. If collections existed, then one could very simply make sure that classes exist by assaying them as collections. Hence there would be no issue. If the connectives thus have a specific ontological ground, how about the quantifiers? Consider what we intend when believing that all particulars have a certain property. Is this intention merely a con- 25</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION junction, infinite to be sure if our world should be infinite in a certain familiar sense-which, by the way, if it is, we shall never know--or is there a specific ingredient? Once I thought that there was. Now I be- lieve that this was perhaps the most egregious among the many egregi- ous mistakes I have made. What, then, we must ask, distinguishes these particular conjunctions and disjunctions, the exhaustive ones, if for the moment I may so call them, from all others? The answer, I now think, is epistemological rather than ontological; i.e., it has something to do with our capacity to think these facts rather than with anything "in" them. This, to be sure, is but a poor hint. Yet I cannot on this occasion say more. Take green once more. What is "in" it? The answer, if I am right, is (1) its form, which happens to be nonrelational universality of the first type; and (2) its determinant, i.e., whatever it is that makes for green being what it is, namely, green rather than red or middle c or sour. Take now two facts, F1 and F2; the former consisting of a certain particular exemplifying green; the latter, of green exemplifying color. Green clearly is "in" F1 and F2. Equally clearly, there is an important difference between the way in which it is "in" either F1 or F2 on the one hand and the way in which its form is "in" it on the other. Green would be what it is even if it were not "in" F1 and F2. As to Fl, only the most embattled idealist would disagree. As to F2, even though green's being a color is a priori, its not being one is at least a potential complex. If, however, whatever that may mean, the form "in" green were replaced by another, then all the complexes in which it occurs would no longer be complexes at all, either actual or potential. As the author of the Tractatus put it, without its form, which he therefore called an inner property, a thing would not be what it is. That spots the importance difference. Let us acknowledge it by calling this being green a fact; green's form being in it, a circumstance. Circumstances and forms are not nothing. Yet they are very different from facts and things. Facts are either actual or potential. For a circumstance which consists in a fact or thing having or not having a certain inner property I would not know what it meant to be potential. This is indeed the import of the dictum that without its form a thing would not be what it is. Accordingly, while the mode of a fact is never presented to us, the actuality of a circumstance, if I may for once quite improperly and dangerously so express myself, sometimes is. Ontologically, at this point at least, realism prevails. Nor, of course, is this a minor point. Dialectically, if we admitted, say, either green's having the form of particularity or its not having the form it does have to the ontological 26</page><page sequence="7">DIVERSITY status of potentiality, we would be started on an infinite regress, from the actual to the potential to the potentially potential, and so on. But, then, how about regress in ontology? I take time out for a digression. A tie needs no tie to tie it to what its ties. Thus Bradley's regress is stopped. A fact is either actual or potential. For a circumstance that consists of a thing or fact either having or not having a certain inner property or form the actual-potential distinction makes no sense. That is how I just stopped another regress. A third still threatens. Sub- sistents, it would seem, fall into kinds and stand in relations. Does that mean that the subsistents exemplify characters and relations? This regress I cut off by denying all ontological status to such would-be properties and relations on the ground that each subsistent, while in one sense sui generis, is yet in another so completely transparent that, say, nonrelational universality of the first type, simply by being what it is, is eo ipso nonrelational, universality in general, and a subsistent. Is one justified in thus cutting off the three regresses? The question is meta- philosophical rather than philosophical. So I shall not stay for an answer. But it is of course a good question. Simple things and transparent subsistents, facts either actual or potential, and circumstances which are neither the one nor the other. Does this list exhaust the structural possibilities of the basic inventory? Reflection shows not only that there are two more but also that these two additional categories provide the ground for existing classes. Why should anyone hold that exemplification exists? Dialectically, a good case can no doubt be made. Yet the root of the matter is phe- nomenological. When presented with a certain particular, say, a, hav- ing a certain property, say, green, we are not only presented with these two things, a and green, but also with their being together in a way characteristically different from the way in which, say, two facts are together in a conjunction. But ignore this characteristic difference, which makes one wonder whether perhaps nexus, too, have forms, and turn instead to the togetherness in the case. What we are presented with when presented with the fact is not just a, green, and together- ness, but, rather, a, green, and, inseparably, if I may thus hint at what I cannot take the time to unpack, the togetherness of a and green. This inseparable togetherness, if I am right, is the seat of the mode. That, though, is merely by the way. The point now is, first, that the together- ness in the case cannot be complex; otherwise we are obviously started on a regress. And the point is, second, that this togetherness cannot possibly be the fact itself. For, if it were, since it is also simple, there would be no other way of grounding its connection with a and green 27</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION rather than with, say, b and red, than by an ontological building stone which is a Fregean function. And a function world, as I have argued elsewhere, simply will not do. Take now green and blue. Sometimes, when presented with them, we are also presented with their not being the same, or, synonymously, with their being diverse. By the principles that guide me, that makes for four entities, the two things, their being diverse, and the complex of which these three are the constituents. Diversity is the entity I add to my inventory. Clearly, it corresponds to exemplification. Yet there is also a crucial difference. In the example the diverse entities, call them a and P, are two things of the same form, green and red, or, for that matter, green and middle c. Consider now two other examples. In the first, make a a thing, say a particular, i.e., an entity which has a form; 0, either par- ticularity or some sort of universality, i.e., an entity which is a form. In the second, make a and P two forms. In these two cases, I submit, a being diverse from P is not a fact, either actual or potential, but a cir- cumstance, which as we know is neither. For, to grant their not being diverse the ontological status of potentiality would once more collapse the categorial pattern. Not so, however, in the case of the original example, nor, generally, in all cases where a and P are either things or facts of the same form. Their diversity is itself a fact. Nor again is the mode of these delta-facts, as I call them, presented to us. To indicate why that is not as absurd as at first it may seem, I shall, however dan- gerously, save words by for once expressing myself linguistically. Just as we can always consistently assign or reassign actuality and poten- tiality so that all sentential tautologies become actual, so we can always consistently name or rename our simples so that a being the same as a and a being diverse from a, become actual and potential, respectively. And, of course, the notion of analyticity can and must be so expanded, by what logicians call the axioms of identity, that while the former, a being the same as a, become analytic, the latter, a being diverse from a, becomes contradictory. If it were not for these delta-facts, I would not know how to argue that classes exist. Of this presently. First I want to add a comment. Then I shall have to remind you of still another kind of entities which we shall also need but which, as it happens, have been in my ontological inventory long before I was again struck by the problem of classes. By choosing as an example two colors rather than two particulars I made things both easier and harder for myself. The particulars of my world are bare. What that means may be in doubt. That it has stirred 28</page><page sequence="9">DIVERSITY up quite a controversy is not. By avoiding particulars I avoided this controversy. That made things easier. The difficulty I courted you will discover when, reflecting on what has just been said about the same- ness and diversity of universals, you will correctly conclude that the determinants of this world's universals are just as bare as those of its particulars. Bareness, if I may so put it, has spread. Naturally; if, as I believe it to be, the world's cardinality is on all levels contingent. Hence, with a twist to the classical words, the determinants of all things, particulars as well as universals, are but matter. The only forms are not, as in the tradition, the determinants of universals, but par- ticularity, universality, and so on. Why, you will ask, this radical rejec- tion of natures? Supposing that the answer you want is structural rather than biographical, I reply that it safeguards the realism. The mode of this exemplifying that is not presented to us. Nor even, pro- vided only they have the same form, is the mode of this being the same as or diverse from that. But that this thing or fact is of that form has no mode and sometimes is presented to us. Better, alas, I cannot do. Now for the reminder. There are also the entities I call derived universals. "Being red and square" and "being hot if red" are two simple examples. Linguistically, each such entity is represented by what one calls a defined predicate expression. That seems to stack the cards formidably against them. For are not all definitions merely stipulative, abbreviations, as one says, and do not create entities? Of course they don't. That, though, does not dispose of the matter. There remains the question whether in some cases where others see merely definitions, the ontologist may not successfully argue that there is also something else. The only condition he must fulfill is that the entities he claims to be there on the one hand and his notion of analyticity on the other are such that the sentence obtained by substituting 'if and only if' for the alleged definitional equality becomes analytic. In the philosophy of mathematics the issue of these entities is not unrelated to that of impredicativity. Goedel, somewhat misleadingly, called those who hold that they exist Platonists. I have long argued that the derived universals exist; not, as it happens, from a special con- cern for the ontology of arithmetic but, rather, because without them I wouldn't know what I see when seeing a horse or a chair rather than, to put it as foolishly as I know how, a cluster of sense data. In the meantime I have come to believe that these arguments need to be tight- ened. Since I cannot do that tonight, I limit myself to a bare minimum of comments. Are derived characters simple or complex? If anything, they are simple. I say "if anything" because, even though after a fashion 29</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION they fit into the type hierarchy, they have an ontological status all their own, which status, with the familiar metaphor, is weak indeed. Yet, weak or strong, they are needed and they are there. Nor finally do they have modes. Altogether, to use a Fregean word in a very un-Fregean way, they are best thought of as a sort of unsaturated entities. What is a class? Since I must be brief, let us limit ourselves to individuals, or, as I would rather say, particulars. Then the condition an entity must satisfy in order to be a class becomes: Every collection determines exactly one class. The two emphases, "every" and "exactly one" stand for the two features usually called the arbitrariness and the extensionality of classes. The arbitrariness Russell missed, for which Ramsey, severely yet justly, took him to task. If the label of the second startles you, just consider that if any "two" classes which, as one says, are co-extensional, are really one, then one says nothing in particular when he says that they can in every context and in every respect stand for each other, which is what is usually meant by extensionality. Select now a finite number of particulars, say, a, b, and c. As I assay it, the class they determine is the derived character of "being the same as, or, synonymously, not being diverse from, either a or b or c." Notice the insistence on literal sameness. Russell, and for that, too, Ramsey took him to task, replaced it by what I shall presently speak of as Russell-Leibniz identity. Notice next the crucial role diversity plays in all this. If diversity were not there and what it is, a thing being either diverse from, or the same as, another of the same form, would not be a fact. And if there were not these facts, there would not be the derived character which, I submit, is the class. Having called these facts delta-facts, I now call a class a derived delta-character, or, also, an enumeration character. In the finite case, that is how I ground the existence of classes. Infinity requires first of all a distinction. If you accept my gambit that the facts, P, (P and P), ((P and P) and P), and so on, are all diverse from each other then, in a sense closely related to ordinal arith- metic, the world is infinite. In a more familiar sense, related to cardinal arithmetic, it is infinite only if there is, say, an infinite collection of particulars. If it is infinite in this sense, which, as I insisted when men- tioning the quantifiers, we would never know, then some of all possible selections will be infinite. How then about the classes such selections determine? At this point I appeal to the new principle: There is an enumera- tion character for each selection, whether finite or infinite. Ramsey agrees. That does not mean we can prove it. Otherwise I wouldn't 30</page><page sequence="11">DIVERSITY speak of a principle. If we are right, then so was Hilbert when he called the axiom of choice a logical truism. Are we right? Ontologically, the only objection I can think of, to the effect that we cannot actually enumerate the class, is unduly anthropomorphic, or, if you please, linguistic, and therefore by implication idealistic. As for enumeration characters, so by the way for all infinite facts. Yet there is a problem here, epistemological rather than ontological, but not therefore less formidable. To hold, as eventually Wittgenstein did, under the influ- ence of the mathematical intuitionists, that the actually infinite does not even make sense is one thing. To take for granted, as it seems Bolzano, Cantor, and Dedekind did, that we can think it, in exactly the same sense in which we can think the finite, is quite another thing. On this issue, I have come to believe, the truth lies in the middle. Per- haps an aphorism will give the idea. If some romantics were right, we could think what we cannot say. According to Wittgenstein, at least at some point in his career, what we can think and what we can say are one. I now believe that there are two sorts of things which we can say and therefore in one sense also think, by axiomatic stand-ins, as it were, while in another sense we cannot think them at all. One of these things, or sorts of things, is the actually infinite; the other, not surpris- ingly, any world so radically different from ours that its categorial pattern differs from that of ours. On the way to an articulate ontology of cardinal and ordinal arith- metic, the existence of classes is but a milestone. Yet I cannot tonight take you beyond it. So I turn to a dialectical tension which appears first at this point. Let a and b be two entities of the same form; a, a fact of which a is a constituent; 3, another fact, obtained from a by replacement in it of some or all occurrences of a by b. a and b are identical if and only if, for every a, a and P are either both actual or both potential. In the lingu- istic version, which, even though it is more familiar, I deliberately avoided, a and b are identical if and only if the expression for one of them can in every context salva veritate be replaced by that for the other. However stated, this is the notion of Russell-Leibniz identity. Such identity and sameness are two and not one. In our world, though, most remarkably, because of the connections it contains, no two entities are identical. Sameness and identity are coextensive. Let us say they coincide. I just said "connections" rather than "relations" in order not to exclude the meaning nexus, since, if it were not for the latter, two acts might be identical. Be that as it may, this most remarkable feature of our world, the coincidence of sameness and identity, is the source of 31</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION two equally remarkable traits of the traditional dialectic. For one, one may, as Leibniz and Russell did, fail to distinguish between sameness and identity. For another, if there were two identical objects, the need for particulars to individuate them would be manifest and certain arguments against particulars would be even weaker than they are. Very curiously, though, both feature and traits are nicely counter- balanced. Suppose for the sake of the argument that green, square, color, and shape are four simple characters; the first two of the first type; the last two of the second; and consider two worlds. One, call it T1, is the trunk of ours, i.e., a world without minds but otherwise exactly like ours. The other, call it T2, is like T1, except that in it every particular is either both green and square or neither. In T2, as one says, but not in Ti, green and square are both simple and coextensive. Remember now that a world is called extensional if and only if any two of its characters which are coextensive are also identical; then consider four sentences. (1) 'Green is a color,' (2) 'square is a shape,' (3) 'green is a shape,' (4) 'square is a color.' (1) and (2) are true; (3) and (4) false in both T, and T2. Yet there is a difference. Since in T2 green and square are coextensive and (1) is true while (4) is false, we see already that T2 is not extensional, while, for all we have seen so far, Ti might be and in fact is extensional, at least if we limit ourselves to simple characters. For it is another most remarkable feature of our world, and therefore of T1, that no two of its simple characters are coextensive. I interrupt for three comments. First: No world with minds is extensional. That is why I merely saved words by considering trunks. Second: Closer examination would show that by limiting myself to simple characters I merely saved time. Third: Two classes which are coextensive are one and not two. Hence a world of classes only, or what amounts to the same, the class skeleton of our world is ex- tensional. Now for the traditional dialectic. The realists hold that a simple character and the class with which it is coextensive are two and not one. Some nominalists argue that what the realists mistake for characters are merely classes. The argument is not always put this way. Nor do those who make it distinguish between classes and mere collections. This, though, is neither here nor there. The point is, rather, that, hav- ing stated his case in this manner, a nominalist may seem to bolster it by pointing out that if class and character really were two and not one, then it would be strange indeed that no class is ever coextensive with more than one simple character. Or, what amounts to the same, or 32</page><page sequence="13">DIVERSITY almost the same, the need for universals would be beyond doubt and certain arguments against there being any would be even weaker than they are, if it were not for that most remarkable feature, the extension- ality of our world's trunk. I said "almost the same" because, since there being no two colors such that what is all over the one is also all over the other and conversely, is merely a priori, the existence of two co- extensive simple characters does not imply nonextensionality. Yet the connection is close indeed. You see now why I spoke first of a tension, then of a nice balance. On the one side, there is the coincidence, in our world, of sameness and identity; on the other, the extensionality of its trunk. The former lends some specious initial plausibility to the confusion between sameness and identity and to certain arguments against the existence of particu- lars. The latter gives the same sort of plausibility to the confusion between classes and characters and to certain arguments against the existence of universals. Great as this tension is, the balance is accurate. For surely there must at least be either particulars or universals- unless, of course, one abandons ontology. Having started on one note not quite conventional, let me end on another. The program sketched, I still think, is viable. Yet I have for quite some time now been exploring an alternative that is more parsi- monious and therefore, by Occam's sound principle, more attractive. Its main gambits are two. First, it develops systematically the idea, mentioned earlier, of individuating all nexus, exemplification, diversity, and the connectives, in a manner that turns them, not of course, since they are merely subsistents, into perfect particulars, yet into entities that have some of the structural features of such particulars. Second, it revives, cautiously and within rather narrow limits, the classical doc- trine of internal relations. For it qualifies the principle that a mere collection of entities is not as such a further one by holding that some entities, in the proper mix, as it were, do indeed without the help of any sort of tie eo ipso form another. These latter entities I call, not without at least some historical justification, I hope, internal relations. Of such there would be two kinds, one more fundamental than the other. The former are circumstances. The latter, like diversity and in essence because of it, have modes. Among the former are the internal relations between, or, less ambiguously, the very special entities con- sisting of, either a thing or a fact on the one hand and its form on the other, such as, say, the internal relation between a particular and par- ticularity. Among the less fundamental ones, those which have modes, two ground order; one, the order in relational atomic facts; the other, 33</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION the order which is established by one fact, say, F, being "in" another, say, (F and G). Ontology is ontology. Mathematics is mathematics. Yet there are windows. So I should like to confirm what, from the two references to order, some of you may already have guessed. The mathematical inspiration, if I may so express myself, of this alternative which I am still exploring,' I owe to that incomparable Mozart of twentieth-century mathematics, John von Neumann. 1These and other explorations, as well as the ones here reported, all belong to a larger project, partial support of which by a grant (GS-1102) of the National Science Foundation is herewith duly acknowledged. 34</page></plain_text>
