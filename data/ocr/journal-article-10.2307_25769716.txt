(Institut fur Geschichte, Karl Franzens Universitat, Graz, 2007), 45. ISBN 978-3-901921-34-6. Reviewed by CM. KAUFFMANN the theme of the Coronation of the Virgin owes its origins to the symbolism of the Bride and Bridegroom in the Song of Songs. Origen identified the Groom and Bride with Christ and the Church whereas Ambrose took the Bride to be the Virgin. It was Jerome, in his translation of the Song of Songs, who first formulated the need to crown the bride. Endorsed by other theologians, the Mariolog ical interpretation of the Song of Songs was rejected by Bede and owing to his influence it was not taken up again until the twelfth century, when it was strongly supported, above all by Bernard. It was in Anglo-Saxon England, with its strong tradition of the veneration of the Virgin, that the earliest tentative images of the Coronation of the Virgin and also of the Virgin with the Trinity were produced. The English contribution to the development of this imagery came to the fore again in the first half of the twelfth century with the depiction of the actual crowning, as opposed to the better-known example of the mosaic in S. Maria in Trastevere of c. 1140 in which the Virgin, already crowned, is enthroned next to Christ. With the growing veneration of the Virgin, these images became frequent from the mid-twelfth century, particularly on the tympani of French cathedrals. Ingrid Flor gives the reader an account of both the textual basis and the different picto rial interpretations of the Coronation of the THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CLII AUGUST 2010 547</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS Virgin, before going on to her chosen theme of the Coronation by the Trinity. She exam ines the early depictions of the Trinity from the time of Augustine, who rejected the abstract symbol of the triangle and identified the Holy Ghost as a dove. Again, it was twelfth-century theology, most notably Rupert of Deutz's identification of Mary as the bride of the Trinity, taken up increasingly in thirteenth-century texts, which lay behind the development of the imagery. Flor's central argument is that the revived popularity of the image of the Coronation of the Virgin towards the end of the fourteenth century resulted from the Great Schism (13 78-1417), when it was seen as a symbol of church unity. In particular, it was the Trinitarian Corona tion, based on the idea of the Holy Trinity as a source of grace, that became popular from this time. Again, it was in England, most notably in the Carmelite Missal of c. 1393?98 (British Library, Add. 29704) and, above all, in the Sherborne Missal (c.1400; BL, Add. 74236), that some of the earliest and most intriguing examples are to be found. The growing popularity of the subject saw the develop ment of the principal types: the Virgin enthroned with God and Christ, the dove above; the anthropomorphic Trinity with the Virgin kneeling; or, in Italy, the trian gular composition with God above, Christ as intermediary between God and man, and the Virgin kneeling below. Each type is discussed in relation to particular mon uments and theological texts and political contexts. The texts and the links with the liturgy are carefully adduced and carry total conviction. Such precision is less attainable in the provision of political context, which forms the most stimulating part of this book. The precise links with the Great Schism are, as the author admits, difficult to pin down, but the different examples discussed are carefully argued. In some cases, the political reference is clearly given within the image, as in the Hours of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, lat. 3055). He had Louis, Duke of Orleans, murdered in 1407, and their well-known symbols - John a lion and Louis a wolf - are clearly depicted, and there are other refer ences to the justification of John's action. The second half of the book is devoted to six detailed studies of individual works or groups which are based on previous articles published by the author. Inevitably, this leads to some repetition. Seventy pages on the retable endowed by the Habsburg king Fred erick IV (later the emperor Frederick III) in 1447 for his Cistercian foundation in Wiener Neustadt may be over-weighty in the context of this book. Nevertheless, it is with this altarpiece that the author has most clearly justified her title of Faith and Power. For the former there are, to take only one example, links with the liturgy of the Assumption of the Virgin, while many of the seventy-two saints depicted for the All Saints litany are political figures such as Louis IX, the emper or Henry II and Charlemagne, who are called upon to protect Frederick's lands and their inhabitants. Although there are places where the arguments could have been shortened, the reader is left with admiration for the author's close knowledge of theological texts and iconographical development and her willingness to tackle the question of depend ence on political context. As an amusing appendix, there is a reproduction of the mosaic of the Coronation of the Virgin in the apse of Trieste Cathedral, installed by Mussolini in 1932 to celebrate the return of Trieste to Italy in 1918 after centuries of Habsburg rule. This book may be highly recommended but, particularly given the density of the content, the lack of an index is much to be regretted.</page></plain_text>
