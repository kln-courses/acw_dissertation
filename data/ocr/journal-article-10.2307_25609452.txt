<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arnold Eisen m ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL AND THE CHALLENGE OF RELIGIOUS PLURALISM One of the gifts that great Jewish religious thinkers offer the rest of us?and I count Heschel as one of the greatest, not only of the twentieth century, but also of the modern period as a whole?is to help us, Jewish or nonjewish, think about religion and the life that religion makes possible. We need such thinkers least at points of faith or commitment where our own thinking comes easily. Minds and souls like Heschel matter far more to us when, as at the present moment, religious thought and practice seem beset by obstacles and challenges that we do not seem able to overcome or get around. For me at least, these are rarely the sort of modernist challenges to belief that so exercised the minds of our predecessors. I am thinking rather of the fact, indisputable in recent years, that religion is inextricably bound up in violence, so much so that it seems impossible to separate the two. There is the problem, too, that religion seems ineluctably drawn to the temptation of fundamentalism, an option powerfully latent in the very use of terms such as "truth," "holy scripture," and "salvation." I want to reflect with Heschel's help on a related and no less formidable challenge to the value of religion: the troublesome fact that the faithful and their institutions are so often intolerant of other faiths and faith communities. Religion seems actively to work against the attainment of real respect for differing religions. Faith, in a word, seems antithetical to pluralism. The question I want to ask, then, is how Heschel managed to be at once such a fervent believer and practitioner of the Jewish religious tradition and such a firm religious pluralist. What in his theology permitted him to take this stance?let alone demanded that he do so? What choices can we see him making at key points in his work that allowed for pluralism? Could he have arrived at the same destination had he chosen otherwise? And?since pluralism is not relativism, and an "I'm okay, you're okay, all is okay" philosophy utterly trivializes any claim to moral knowledge, let alone the claims of faith to know something about God and how human beings are meant to live in the presence of God?I want to inquire into the limits of Heschel's pluralism. What could he not affirm? Whom could he, as it were, not doi:10.1093/mj/kjn018 Advance Access publication March 21, 2009 ? The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Or does Jewish religious pluralism in our day demand that we perhaps take advantage of doors that Heschel opened but did not himself walk through? In the end, I find the "nos" that Heschel pronounced, and the "yeses" he could not bring himself to utter, every bit as challenging as the pluralism that he urged and practiced. The possibilities that even his capacious soul refused to entertain give me pause as I seek a religious path that avoids violence and fundamentalism. I want none theless to think, with Heschel's help, some thoughts that he did not or could not venture. If we are serious about attaining religious pluralism in our day, I believe that we have no choice. NOT AN ISLAND Let's begin where Heschel addressed our topic most directly: the 1965 speech at Union Theological Seminary entitled "No Religion is an Island." Its first line identifies Heschel as "a member of a congre gation whose founder was Abraham, and the name of my rabbi is Moses." He is, in other words, a Jew commanded by Torah. The next paragraph further identifies him as "a person who is often afraid and terribly alarmed lest God has turned away from us in disgust."1 The crimes of Nazism are then cited?the better, I suspect, to make the point that pluralism is necessary before proceeding to argue that it is possible. It is necessary, Heschel continues, because just as the Nazis had posed a threat to all the world in the 1940s, the Enlightenment posed a continuing threat to all religion in the 1960s. What is more, Jews and Christians still faced a common enemy, "worldwide in extent and influence: nihilism."2 Despite "fundamental disagreements," therefore, the two groups should seek out convergence of views, tasks, and goals. Heschel begins that effort with an appeal to the nature of human persons: a commonalty easily affirmed. Only then does he reach the difficult question: "how a Jew out of his com mitment and a Christian out of his commitment can find a religious basis for communication and cooperation on matters relevant to their moral and spiritual concern in spite of disagreement."3 Cooperation is, of course, a lot easier to attain than pluralism. Heschel begins modestly, I suspect, on the assumption that if the lesser objective eludes us the greater will certainly do so. And indeed he sensibly lays out in the very next paragraph four elements of religion that, as we learn in what follows, lend themselves to coopera tion with others in differing degrees. The same will hold true, we can infer, with regard to pluralism. There is teaching, often summarized as</page><page sequence="3">6 Arnold Eisen creed; faith, inwardness, direction of the heart; law, sacred deed; and the context for these three, which Heschel calls community covenant, history, and tradition. The key sentence is this one: I suggest that the most significant basis for meeting of men of different religious traditions is the level of fear and trembling, of humility and contrition, where our individual moments of faith are mere waves in the endless ocean of mankind's reaching out for God, where all formulations and articulations appear as understatements, where our souls are swept away by the awareness of the urgency of answering God's commandment, while stripped of pretension and conceit we sense the tragic insufficiency of human faith.4 The rest of my article, like the rest of Heschel's, will in one way or another explicate this sentence. It expresses the heart of Heschel's strategy for pluralism, and suggests the reasons why that strategy may not prove successful. Consider the metaphor of ocean and waves. Man Is Not Alone famously assumes and argues that one cannot arrive at knowledge of God, or proximity to God, solely through reason. Another faculty is needed: the sense of the ineffable. "The search of reason ends at the shore of the known; on the immense expanse beyond it only the sense of the ineffable can glide... Reason cannot go beyond the shore, and the sense of the ineffable is out of place where we measure, where we weigh." And, most beautifully of all, "we sail because our mind is like a fantastic sea shell, and when applying our ear to its lips we hear a perpetual murmur from the waves beyond the shore."5 The question demanded by our purposes here is whether, if we heard more than the murmur, let alone saw God clearly; if we could, as it were, find God on land, in and through the use of language and the making of distinctions, both of them critical to reason, let alone through criticism by reason?whether in that case too we could reach God in Search of Man, a way that allows for pluralism. Man Is Not Alone rules the question counterfactual. We cannot get to God that way. Chapter Seven takes up "The God of Philosophers," only in order to argue at its conclusion that "there is much we can achieve in our quest of God by applying rational methods, provided we remember that, in matters that concern the totality of life, all higher attainments of our personality should be brought into play, particularly our sense of the ineffable."6 By the middle of Chapter Nine, Heschel hopes to have guided the reader to the realization that "the issue that emerges before us is not whether there is a God, but whether we know that there is a God... the problem is: How do we tell it to our minds?"7 Note that in order to ask that question we need to have accepted the difference between who we are in some essential respects and our minds. As he did</page><page sequence="4">The Challenge of Religious Pluralism 7 earlier, with the language of "measure and weigh," Heschel invokes Kant again at this point, where reason is arguing for its own insuffi ciency. "How do we overcome the antinomies... ?"8 It turns out that it is not really we who do this overcoming in Heschel's account of the path to God. "Faith is not a product of our will."9 Heschel calls it rather an "enforced concern." In the climactic pages of the chapter, a description of religious experience so beautiful and so stirring that I believe that it has to have been based upon a personal encounter with God, Heschel remains true to the insight about our lack of agency. We arrive at the encounter via despair. The moment is full of "overpowering brilliance." The ineffable shudders itself into the soul, penetrates us with God's insight. "A cry, wrested from our very core, fills the world around us, as if a mountain were suddenly about to place itself in front of us... Holy, holy, holy, we cannot comprehend it. We only know it means infinitely more than we are able to echo. We stammer and say... He to whom our lives can be the spelling of an answer." And, after the brief pause of a paragraph break: "An inspiration passes; having been inspired never passes. It remains like an island across the restlessness of time, to which we move over the wake of undying wonder."10 "No Religion is an Island" then, points to at least two profound senses that we might not have grasped had we not gone back to this locus classicus in Heschel's writings. Religion, first of all, is far more than encounter with God of the sort Heschel has so remarkably described. It is also far less. Religion includes teaching and creed, behavior and law, and the communal life bounded and directed by covenant and tradition. Inspiration, the ineffable, the noumenal, God's neighborhood?is the island, to which we get back, as Man Is Not Alone puts it, on the wake of undying wonder. Heschel did not mean to say, we can affirm confidently on the basis of many others things he wrote, that creed and deed and covenant have no role in transporting us to God. Of course they do. The Jewish "pattern for living" that we call mitzvah is just as surely a way leading back to God as it is the way leading from God. Mitzvah is the answer given Jews to the question Heschel leads the reader of his "philosophy of religion" to pose: how shall I live in the world, now that I know that God is present here with me? Members of other traditions will give parallel but different answers. But they, like Jews, are meant to use those same "patterns for living" as ways of coming near to God. We approach God's presence by joining with God in search of man, thereby imitating God, learning about God, and achieving our highest and avoiding our lowest. These patterns for living well lead to and from the encounter</page><page sequence="5">8 Arnold Eisen with God. They are no less essential than wonder, mystery, the voyage across the waves. I stress the point, because the "mystical moment" in religion is the most important to Heschel, and it is therefore all the more important to recall that it was not for him the only thing that mattered. We are talking about Abraham Joshua Heschel, after all: the thinker who insisted on maintaining each pole in a series of polarities: halakha as well as aggadah, keva as well as kavanah, care for the bodies of widows and orphans as well as travel to the far reaches of the soul. Teaching, law, and community are indispensable. They are just not ultimate. We should also note, because Heschel does, that there are tried and true religious paths that do not lead to God. Some modes of transport will not take us to the island and might actually take us farther away from it. We might for example insist on the uniqueness of our "individual moments of faith" to the exclusion of respect for others, forgetting that these moments are "mere waves in the endless ocean of mankind's reaching out for God." We might mistake our words about God?which may include words in our possession that we believe have reached us from God?for "formulations and articulations" that are more than "mere understatements" or "stammering." We might remain so focused on the details of the behavior that we regard as God's commandment, including behavior that sets us apart from others who act differently in the name of their god or gods, and laws that require us to resist or suppress those others' actions, in the name of our God?we might remain so focused on this that "our souls are [not] swept away by the awareness of the urgency of answering God's commandment." That commandment, life with God, is our goal. It must be more encompassing than any account we give of it unless "pretension and conceit" prevent us from sensing "the tragic insufficiency of human faith."11 This is a hard balance to strike. I submit that it is a necessary condition of Heschel's pluralism. Confidence in the sufficiency or exclusive legitimacy of "deed" or "community" would have made Heschel's pluralism immensely more difficult to maintain. THE MOUNTAIN The balance Heschel seeks can perhaps become clearer if we imagine him in shul on Shabbat Ki Tissa, reading along with us the passage from the Torah (Exodus 32-34) that is arguably its theological high point. Up at the top of Mount Sinai, Moses is receiving the last of the blueprints for the tabernacle, while down below, the Israelites,</page><page sequence="6">The Challenge of Religious Pluralism 9 impatient to see God or at least Moses in their midst, have fashioned a golden calf. God is angry at this straying from the covenant; Moses, responding to God's pathos as well as God's will (the sequence is tailor-made for Heschel's controversial theory of prophecy)1 , secures God's promise not to destroy the children of Israel. He then descends the mountain and destroys the calf. Heschel would have pointed out, I think, that Moses's anger, like God's before it, is triggered by the unmistakable sight of the Israelite orgy; the sounds that reach his hearing while he is coming down the slope are by contrast so ambiguous that he and Joshua disagree about what they signify. More important, I think, Heschel would have wanted us to note God's reaction to Moses's unprecedented request to be shown God's glory or presence (kavod). I confess that despite studying this unit of text many times, I had always read it as a divine denial of Moses's amazing request. "No human being can see Me and live."13 I imagine Heschel engaging in such an encounter with the text, finding ample confirmation for his theory of prophecy, and emerging more determined than ever to pursue a religious pluralism that knows faith to be much more than Moses or any other prophet, let alone any normal member of any faith community, might put into words or proclaim as truth. "No Religion is an Island." We do not live on the island with God, any more than we live at the (analogous) top of the mountain. Religion is related to but not the same as the water of undying wonder, the waves that sweep up the soul. A religion totally lacking in these, we might say, or failing to evoke them, would be a failure at its appointed task. But a religion that was only these would be out of touch with the quotidian stuff of life?lived on dry land. No tabernacle or temple is required on the island, for no human being can long reside there. Pluralism is possible because, on the island, we can all speak the same unspoken language beyond language, experience the surpassing of our differences, and so relativize the commitments that we for good reason regard normally as absolutes?"for good reason" because those commitments have their source and destination at the island, the place where we most want to go. All we do below the mountain, on the land, is less than ultimate, for all that our countenances shine with the glow of God's enduring presence. That is why we can and should be pluralists. BOUNDARY MARKERS This recognition, however, points as well to the second sense in which "No Religion is an Island": the sense that explains why pluralism,</page><page sequence="7">10 Arnold Eisen although possible, is very difficult even with the best of intentions. Not only do we not live on the island. The fact is that, on land, we cannot know who or where we are without clear boundaries. The boundaries that mark off one territory from another are not natural but imposed. We must therefore expend enormous effort making and enforcing them. Collective and personal identity is not easily secured. Two paragraphs after making the point in the UTS address that "the first and most important prerequisite of interfaith is faith," Heschel makes the still more difficult point, where pluralism is con cerned, that "in a world of conformity, religions can easily be leveled down to the lowest common denominator. Both communication and separation are necessary. We must preserve our individuality as well as foster care for one another."14 To that end, he urges Christians and Jews to ponder what they owe to one another, how they have harmed one another through persecution or disrespect. He also interjects, as is his wont, several stipulations that show how difficult it is to separate and communicate, preserve individuality, and exercise mutual care. "Religion is a means, not an end." This we know already. Heschel repeats the lesson here because as hard as it is to preserve any faith, let alone one that denies its members the ability to see their God, it is harder still to do so while bearing in mind that what we live and die for is only means, not ends. "The ultimate truth is not capable of being full and adequately expressed in concept and words. The ultimate truth is about the situation that pertains between God and man. The Torah speaks in the language of men.' "15 This too comes as no surprise, though it is a teaching fraught with peril. Why remain devoted to the words, these words; why find all life's meaning inside them, if they do not express ultimate truth? What is at stake in the words "fully" and "adequately" in the sentence quoted at the top of this paragraph? How inadequate or empty can the devarim of Torah be if we are urged to proclaim them our life, the length of our days? Deuteronomy takes pains to deny the charge of emptiness, for good reason.16 So does the Psalmist, over and over again.1 How can an ultimate truth be "about" a situa tion, as Heschel put it, unless it gives a full and adequate account of that situation? We can of course accept that the Torah accommodates itself to human limitations. Any other reading of the text would at some points convince us that it is not worthy of our commitment. But where shall we draw the line at the relativizing and historicizing of belief? Maimonides said famously that for God not to have given the ancient Israelites the ritual of sacrifice would have been as fatal to the establishment of true religion as denying his own contemporaries the ability to pray.18 Is prayer, too, an accommodation to the human situation, a function of our life on land among other human beings</page><page sequence="8">The Challenge of Religious Pluralism 11 who speak, act, and think differently? Just how far down the slippery slope that starts at the mountaintop can we go, before ending up at the bottom in frenzied dance around a golden calf? Two more stipulations necessary for pluralism in matters of religion are then provided by Heschel. Both pertain to providence. "Perhaps it is the will of God that in this eon there should be diversity in our forms of devotion and commitment to Him. In this eon diversity of religions is the will of God."19 And the second: "None of us pretends to be God's accountant, and His design for history and redemption remains a mystery before which we must stand in awe." It is therefore arrogant of Christians to call the Jews blind for refusing to accept Jesus as their Messiah. It is also a mistake for Jews "not to acknowledge the glory and holiness in the lives of countless Christians. 'The Lord is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.' "20 There are two possibilities limned here that would preclude plu ralism, or at least make it very hard, and Heschel rejects both of them. (1) Suppose we could be God's accountants. It would then be crucial, perhaps worth fighting over, to make sure history is properly understood. Why had Heschel's family been killed by the Nazis, and he spared? How could a Jew, taking seriously such human accountings of God, take seriously people who, say, ascribed the Holocaust to God's anger at Zionism, or to God's continuing punishment of the Jews for their rejection of Jesus? "The presence of God in Search of Man history," Heschel wrote, "is never conceived to mean His penetration of history. God's will does not dominate the affairs of men."21 It is not just that we do not know God's workings well enough to explain them. God does not work in this way. Heschel's limited view of providence is crucial to his pluralism, I think.22 Pluralism thrives on such theological modesty where providence is concerned. (2) Suppose, however, that one denies belief in a Lord of history?a God who possesses will and intention, including will and intention for the World. What if the language of nearness were not just anthropomorphism when applied to divinity, but a total category mistake? Heschel seems to have built two unspoken limits to pluralism into the very formula tion that authorizes and encourages pluralism. All of the proof-texts cited in his "philosophy of religion," Man Is Not Alone, are biblical. He could do this credibly, I think, while claiming to explicate a "philosophy of religion" and not just "of Judaism," because the sort of religion his philosophy</page><page sequence="9">12 Arnold Eisen described is biblical but not merely Jewish. The three mono theistic faiths regard this scripture as holy, and no other faiths come close to the prophetic view of faith that Heschel expounded and obeyed. The ultimate truth of the prophets bore witness to the same ultimate truth as every mystic of whatever tradition?and included as well a demand that many non-monotheistic religions denied: the demand of God to take care of God's creatures and God's world. Heschel never undertook the task of arguing that Hinduism, despite many gods, and Buddhism, despite many gods or no god, pointed fundamentally to the same ultimate truth as Judaism. (This task is difficult but arguably not impossible.) Nor did he try to demonstrate that the social ethics of Hinduism or Buddhism resembled those of the biblical faiths. He never to my knowledge engaged Islam, and was not loathe to concede vast differences between Judaism and Christianity. These are doors to which he never pointed, let alone walked through. But that is not to say that it would be futile for us to try or that Heschel would have been averse to the attempt. Consider the way he got around and past the differences among the biblical prophets differences that served Spinoza as proof that they could not all speak the words of a personal God who revealed them23?by focusing on the consciousness of the prophet, which he regarded as common to all, rather than the teachings of the prophets, which he conceded were many and various. Recall, too, the distinction he drew on the very first page of God in Search of Man between theology?which always sets us apart even from fellow-believers in our own tradition?and depth theology, which keeps Akiba and Ishmael on the same page. I suspect that Heschel understood his own authentic continuity with his Hasidic ancestors in similar fashion. Depth-theology is the key. Once the Torah is not taken to be the word of God, but a midrash on the word of God, the varieties of belief inside a given tradition pale in importance.24 So, too, do the varieties that distinguish between and among traditions. I do not think we can be sure, just because Heschel never ventured further afield from his own tradition than Christianity, that our pluralism should not extend farther. I am certain of what we should not do: pronounce all religions "basically the same" or "the same in all essentials." But it is hard to know in advance, once freed of existing halakhic strictures, what differences exactly must be "deal breakers" where respect is concerned. I would have liked to see Heschel's commentary on the seven Noahide commandments, the better to know what alternate list he would have composed, and so to help with the formulation of our own. Might we not preserve full</page><page sequence="10">The Challenge of Religious Pluralism 13 awareness of the differences separating the world's major traditions from one another, reject some elements of those religions as incom patible with our deepest moral and religious insights and convictions, but still affirm other faiths worthy of our respect? It is helpful, in pondering this question, to remember where Heschel did draw the line. Immediately after the confessional account of encounter with God in Man Is Not Alone, we find this paragraph. We may be able to say no, if we decide to feed our mind on pre sumption and conceit, to cling to duplicity and to refuse to mean what we sense, to think what we feel. But there is no man who is not shaken for an instant by the eternal. And if we claim we have no heart to feel, no soul to hear, let us pray for tears and a feeling of i 25 shame. Heschel is equally judgmental in the opening paragraph of God in Search of Man Search, where he attacks religion for becoming "irrel evant, dull, oppressive, insipid."26 Note the series of contrasts invoked in the passage to separate good from bad religion, holy from profane: faith versus creed, worship versus discipline, love versus habit. Heschel deplores focus on the splendor of the past rather than the crisis of the present, the degeneration of faith from living fountain to heirloom. He criticizes the voice of authority when it leaves no room for the voice of compassion.27 There is no critique here of mistaken teachings or aberrant deeds or poor communal forms. These may well preserve what is essential in a religion: "an answer to mans ultimate questions."2^ Note: an answer, never the answer, and as such not the object of Heschel's critique. The sins that he faults destroy religion of any sort, render any faith meaningless, preclude wonder, and sap integrity. That is why he attacks them. It is good to see Heschel in judgmental mode, lest we dismiss him as a sentimental do-gooder, a relativist in saint's clothing. It is good to see as well that the boundaries he draws run through and not between traditions, inside and not just outside each individual. Humility would otherwise be impossible, and without it there is, of course, no pluralism. CONCLUSION Heschel's ruminations on the need for pluralism and the difficulty in attaining it suggest one final obstacle to our achievement of what he so desired. The real problem where pluralism is concerned may not be convincing the world's religions that they should respect one another but that they actually need one another. Believers are rarely taught</page><page sequence="11">14 Arnold Eisen that there are actual lacunae in their faiths that others can help fill, in the way that Plato pronounced love a mixture of poverty and plenty.29 Religion tends to be all-encompassing. It fosters the sense of its own self-sufficiency. How many Jews sincerely believe they need the Jews who differ from them, let alone that their spiritual well-being requires Christians or Muslims, or that the world is really better off because it has all these faith communities that have so far?except for small elites of mystics and philosophers?kept a careful distance from one another when not actually on the offensive against error or life? "Very few" is the answer to that rhetorical question. We know the others are out there, but most of the time we would rather believe ourselves to be living on the island, surrounded not by competing certainties as uncertain as our own, but only by waves of wonder that lap invitingly at our shores. If that is true, the first task for would-be pluralists is not long-distance swimming practice. It is rather standing up on our little spaces of dry land looking around with both eyes open and walking next door to meet the neighbors. JEWISH THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY OF AMERICA NOTES 1.

I now see it differently. God is denying Moses's request to be the object of his knowledge. He cannot see the glory. No human being can be the subject of such a sentence, and have God as an object. God has a different sort of knowing in mind. As God's goodness passes by Moses's face, he will hear the speech of God filled by the will of God with the sound of God's own name, held in place by God on a rock, his whole being grasped and transformed by God's glory. When God's glory passes, he can look all he likes?no longer needing to do so. Every pore of his being will recall the experience of the God who held him. 14.
