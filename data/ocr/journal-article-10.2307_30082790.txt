<plain_text><page sequence="1">FAITH AND FACTS.' BY PROFESSOR ALFRED RAHILLY, M.A., B.SC. TT is at first sight very unsettling and disconcerting 1 that great and clever men with trained intellects have lost faith in God and immortality or in Christianity through what they term their scientific researches. The ordinary student is apt to become discouraged and be wildered by this defection; he is led to suspect, with an undefined apprehension, the existence of facts .incom patible with his faith. I propose, therefore, to look at the matter a little more closely. There is no need to devise a theological definition or subtle analysis of faith; we may take it in a general sort of way as belief in God nd especially in Christ. The question, then, is this Is faith either gained or lost through facts The question I am well aware, is rather broadly and roundly put. But I. am anxious to avoid the semblance of anything abstract or metaphysical. The question concerns everyone of us most vitally and practically, and conveys a clear meaning to anyone even remotely conversant with the troublous issues of modern science. And it is best answered for us, not by disquisitions or exhortations, but by squarely facing concrete instances of unbelief. I proceed, therefore, to examine briefly the account of the process which some leading men of science have themselves given. The repre sentatives chosen are not men of straw, not atheists of It lecturo given to the Catholic Students of University College, Cork.</page><page sequence="2">Faith and Facts. 42 the stamp of Tom Paine, Charles Bradlaugh, or Robert Blatchford; but men of scientific and philosophical pre-eminence, whose want of faith is apt to puzzle a Catholic student. He finds it disconcerting that men whose achievements are landmarks in science or scholar ship should reject the Christian faith. The tacit assump tion is, of course, that such faith was found to be incon sistent with the results of life-long research. You might imagine, for instance, that Gibbon lost his faith owing to his investigations into the origins of Chris tianity as recorded in the Decline and Fall. Not at all. Here is his own account : I still remember my solitary transport at the discovery of a philosophical argument against the doctrine of transubstantiation: that the text of scripture which seems to inculcate the real presence is attested only by a single sense-our sight; while the real presence itself is disproved by three of our senses-the sight, the touch, and the taste. The various articles of the Romish creed disappeared like a dream; and after a full conviction, on Christmas Day, 1754, I received the sacrament in the church of Lausanne. It was here that J suspended my religious inquiries, acquiescing with implicit belief in the tenets and mysteries which are adopted by the general consent of Catholics and Protestants.1 The argument against the Eucharistic Presence is rather silly, is it not Five hundred years before young Gibbon's "discovery," St. Thomas Aquinas, in his hymn "Adoro Te Devote," had told us "visus, gustus, tactus in Te fallitur-sed auditu solo tuto creditur." It certainly was not historical research which made Gibbon "suspend his religious inquiries" at the mature age of -guess seventeen. We have nothing to fear for our faith when the historian allows, in Porson's famous phrase,2 his humanity to slumber while "women are ravished or the Christians persecuted," when "he stoops to the most despicable pun or to the most awkward -perversion of 1 Memoirs, ed.

[SEPT. language, for the purpose of turning the Scripture into ribaldry or of calling Jesus an impostor." Renan, too, might conceivably have lost his faith in Christianity owing to his knowledge of Semitic religion and philology. Yet here, too, we find that before he ever encountered the facts on whose presentment his reputa tion is based, he had ceased to believe. If we can credit his own Reminiscences, "his faith was destroyed by historical criticism, not by SchoIasticim or by philo sophy." For instance, he found it hard tO believe the literal reality of the terrestrial paradise, the forbidden fruit, etc. "Now," concluded Renan, who was supposed to have been studying theology for two years, "now one is not a Catholic if on a single one of these points he departs from the traditional thesis.112 It is hard to be patient with a man, a theologian, who gives as his reason for leaving the Church his belief in views which any Catholic may hold. But Renan further urges his youthful belief in the existence of contradictions between the Fourth Gospel and the Synoptics. "I see these contradictions," he says,3 "with such an absolute evidence that I would stake thereon, without a moment's hesitation, my life and hence my eternal salvation." This from a man who came to see4 "the vanity of this virtue (chastity as of all others," and who gradually lost the power of committing himself to any definite affirmation. It is quite in keeping with the man's irrepressible levity to claim that lie owed his unbelief to-reading the Gospels. It is quite disingenuous on his part never to mention the fact that his s300tical sister used to smuggle infidel books to him while he was a student at St. Sulpice.5 But even his own account lets us clearly see that his loss of faith had nothing to do with Souvenitrs, p. 187, ed. Nelson. 'IbcL, P. 213. I have already quoted and refuted this in Sir B. Windle's The Church and Science, pp. 186-191. Ibid., p. 216. Ibid., p. 257. 5Espinasse: Life of E.

Some 600ths sufficed to relegate these vestiges of faith to the portion of our souls consecrated to reminiscences. The affirmation that everything is of one colour in the world, that there is no special supernatural and no momentary revelation, imposed itself absolutely on out spirit. The clear scientific view of a universe in which no free-will higher than man's acts in any appreciable way, became, since the first 600ths of 1846, the unshakeable anchor which we have never left.' Renan was twenty-three and Berthelot eighteen when they cast anchor; at the outset of their lives they definitely and finally decided that no will ex300t man's ever inter fered with the course of nature. Notice carefully that this conclusion preceded, and did not follow from, the researches, historical and chemical, which have made these men famous. It is a surprising and significant inversion. Turn now to a redoubtable protagonist of scientific agnosticism. This is what Huxley tells us of the formation of his outlook on life : Kicked into the world a boy without guide or training or with worse than none, I confess to my shame that few men have drunk deeper of all kinds of sin than I. Happily my course was arrested in time-before I had earned absolute destruction-and for long years I have been slowly and painfully climbing, with many a fall, towards better things. And when I look back, what do I find to have been the agents of my redemption The hope of immortality or of future reward I can honestly say that for these fourteen years such a consideration has not entered my head. No, I can tell you exactly what has been at work. Barter Resartus led me to know that a deep sense of religion was compatible with the entire absence of theology. Secondly, science and her methods gave me a resting-place independent of authority and tradition. Thirdly, love opened up to me a view of the sanctity of human nature and impressed me with a deep sense of responsibility.2 Souvenirs, pp. 242f. 2 Life, i. 220. Letter written in 1860.</page><page sequence="5">428 Studies. ISEPTO Though the accuracy of his accusation against his parents is very questionable, Huxley is himself the best judge of his youthful depravity. What were the means he employed to prevent himself from "becoming a debauched and useless carcass of a man" First, he learnt from Carlyle that religion can exist without any thought. Secondly, he adopted the time-honoured ex pedient of getting absorbed in his work. Thirdly, he got married. Only the first point concerns usdirectly now How exactly did Huxley get rid of theology He tells us distinctly that his want of faith is not due to any concrete facts or special difficulties, but simply and solely because, steeped as he was in science all day, the impersonal and mechanical aspect of nature so engrossed hint that there was no room for living belief in a personal God. Here are his words, in a letter addressed to Kingsley :I Whether astronomy and geology can or cannot be made to agree with the statements as to the matters of fact laid down in Genesis-whether the Gospels are historically true or not-are matters of comparatively small moment in the face of the impassable gulf between the anthropomorphism (however refined of theology and the passionless impersonality of the unknown and unknowable which science shows everywhere underlying the thin veil of phenomena. Here seems to me to be the great gulf fixed between science and theology-beside which all Colenso controversies, reconcilements of Scripture q la Pye Smith, etc., cut a very small figure.' You must have thought over all this long ago; but steeped as I am in scientific thought from morning till night, the contrast has, perhaps, a greater vividness to me. Later in life, indeed, as he outgrew some of the exu berance of youth and "found his dislike to the thought of extinction increasing as he got older and nearer the goal,112 he sometimes bridged the gulf between what he called science and theology. "It is," he says,3 "the secret of the superiority of the best theological teachers to the I Life, 1. 239. 2 Life, ii. 62. 3Life, ii. 303.</page><page sequence="6">1017. Faith and Facts. 429 majority of their opponents, that they substantially recognise these realities of things, however strange the forms in which they clothe their con300tions." his incursions into ethics had taught him the existence of "realities" undreamt of in his biology. Yet even the dim consciousness of his own one-sidedness failed to teach him the smallest tincture of anything more than verbal agnosticism. He was, and remained, irreverent, arrogant, and intolerant; much more so than his orthodox oppo nents who, often enough, shared Huxley's narrowness. It is so important to convince ourse1ves that impartial serenity is as difficult to the man of science as' to the theologian, that I venture to quote an anecdote of Mivart : I began to speak about toleration, for which I have, and have always had, what is, perhaps, a weakness. Turning to Huxley for support, he astonished me by saying, '.' Oh, you must not appeal to me to support toleration as a principle." "Indeed," said L "No," lie continued, "I think vice and error ought to be extirpated by force if it could be done." "You amaze me," I rejoined; "then you rehabilitate Torquemada and some others we have all been accustomed to blame." "I think," he answered, they were quite right in principle, though the way they carried the principle out was injurious to their cause." "Surely," I exclaimed, "burning alive is a strong measure." "Yes," said he, "especially the smell." At this we all laughed, and the subject dropped. Mivart, by the way, had aroused Huxley's wrath for having dared to question some of Darwin's views; in fact he "was constrained to decline election at the Athenaeum, being certain of blackballs by reason of his quarrel with the Darwinians."2 "I might attack Chris tianity as much as I chose and nobody cared one straw," wrote Samuel Butler in 1901; "but when I attacked Darwin it was a different matter. For many years Evolu tion Old and New and Unconsciow9 Memory made a ship wreck of my literary prospects." So true is it that scientific 1Njvkenth Century, Doe., 1897 p. 995. 2 Lord Acton: Lctter8 to Mary Gladstone, P. 129.</page><page sequence="7">430 Studies. (SFPT. faith tends to persist not only without facts but in spite of them-apart altogether from the fraudulent manu facture of "facts" as exemplified in Haeckel's forgeries. We all profess to believe in evolution. But if you ask even a medical student why he believes in it, "you will find him quite at a loss for a definite answer and disposed to take refuge in some platitude, such as the survival of the fittest-he could hardly be more nonplussed if you were to question him on religion."-' The esoterid views as opposed to the public utteances of Huxley concerning evolution are extremely instructive. When in his biological lectures he spoke of transition of species, he did "not in the least mean to say that one species turned into a second to develop thereafter into a third"; he simply meant "that the characters of the second are intermediate between those of the two others. 112 In plain English, he employed no genetic hypothesis. This reticence seemed so curious to Pvre Hahn, S.J., who attended his lectures, that he inter rogated Huxley: "For several 600ths now I have been attending your course, and I have never heard you mention evolution, while in your public lectures every where you openly proclaim yourself an evolutionist." "Here in my teaching lectures," said Huxley, "I. have time to put the facts fully before a trained audience. In my public lectures I am obliged to pass rapidly over the facts, and I put forward my personal convictions; and it is for this that people come to hear mt."2 Surely a most astounding admission: popular science is constructed not out of facts but out of personal convictions. And just see what were Huxley's convictions as expounded to gullible, half-educated audiences. "My workingmen stick to me wonderfully," he writes,3 the house being fuller than ever last night. By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they are 600keys." And again he wrote 'Dwight: Thoughts of a Catholic Anatomist, pp. 60.L 2 Life, ii. 405. 3Life, i. 190.</page><page sequence="8">1917.1 Faith and Facts. 431 to Hooker :1 "I went in for the entire animal more strongly in fact than they have reported me. I told them in so many words that I entertained no doubt of the origin of man from the same stock as the apes. And to my great delight, in saintly Edinburgh itself, the announcement met with nothing but applause." The infamy and levity of it all, the ignoble prostitution of science to evoke ignorant applause by a joke about 600keys Did it not savour too much of Huxley's own intolerant dogmatism, we might long for the days of Galileo and the Inquisition. And what was the mental calibre of his popular audiences "Huxley's usual lectures are something awful to listen to," wrote one hearer, afterwards distinguished as an African traveller.2 "One half of the class, which numbers about 400, have given up in despair from sheer inability to follow him. But with all the drawbacks, I would not miss them, even if they were ten times as difficult. They are something glorious, sublime . . . If only you heard a few of the lectures, you would be surprised to find that there were so few missing links in the chain of life from the amoeba to the genus horno." On one occasion, after a lecture on the "Nervous System," a lady came to the table and asked Huxley to explain just one point which she had not understood. "I did not quite gather," she said, "whether what you called the cerebellum is inside the skull or outside."3 A600g such people Huxley made his converts without an unnecessary expenditure of facts. Needless to say, many smaller fry imitate the great Huxley in heartlessly robbing of their faith half-ignorant workmen or immature students by putting before them unverified hypotheses to which scientific names lend undeserved authority. When these victims of profes sorial prejudice or rationalistic claptrap lose their faith, is it because they have learnt facts incompatible with 1Lifc, 1. 195. Life, i. 443. Mivart: Nineteenth Century, Dec. 1897, p. 988.</page><page sequence="9">IV 432 Studies. [SEPT. faith Surely not. They are quite incompetent (1 to test the facts, (2 to examine the faith, (3 to establish their incompatibility. They have certainly lost faith in Christ and substituted therefor faith in some professor or writer. But the process cannot be described as a scientific demolition of faith. Turn now from the trenchant polemics of Huxley to the quieter, more abiding work of Darwin. He, too, lost all faith-but it was 'not owing to facts, real or supposed, encountered by him in his scientific work. He tells us how in a characteritic passage : I was very unwilling to give up my belief. I feel sure of this, for I can well remember often and often inventing day-dreams of old letters between distinguished Romans and manuscripts being discovered at Pompeii or elsewhere, which confirmed in the most striking manner all that was written in the Gospels. But I found it more and more difficult, with free scope given to my imagination, to invent evidence which would suffice to convince me. Thus disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress.1 Side by side with this interesting confession, let me read you an example of the way in which Darwin's tin belief is exploited. In 1881, Aveling (Marx's son-in-law took the materialist Bfchner to lunch with Darwin. "We found upon enquiry," he says,2 "that he was some forty years of age before he became an agnostic. Asked why he gave up the Christian religion, he made the reply, 'Because I found no evidence for it.' And this, coming from perhaps the greatest and most careful weigher of evidence ever known, has its significance." Curiously enough, a few lines before, Aveling had said that "a than 's views on speculative subjects have in a sense nothing to do with his scientific work and beliefs"; and he entirely omits to record Darwin's view of socialism-which "has its significance." Now what search for Christian evidences did Charles Darwin make Did he take a tithe of the 1 Life, 1. 308. 2 a. Darwin and K. Marx, 1897, p. 130</page><page sequence="10">1917.1 Faith and Facts. 483 trouble bestowed, for instance, on exploring the variation of plants and animals under domestication Not a bit of it. Did he even study the Gospels No; he just "invented day-dreams" of new archaologica1 finds.-' And even these conjectured discoveries, he soon saw, would not "suffice to convince him." So he turned more and more to biology and put religious questions out of his head-which was all the easier as he had a beautiful home and an ample income. "The conclusion which I always come to," he says,2 "after thinking of such ques tions, is that they are beyond the human intellect, and the less one thinks on them the better." And with the gradual, painless loss of faith there came 11so the atrophy of all higher aesthetic experiences. Writing in 1876, when sixty-seven years of age, he tells us : Up to the age of thirty or beyond it, poetry of many kinds such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Shelley-gave me great pleasure; and even as a schoolboy I took great delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical plays. I have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable, and music very great, delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry; I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and found it so intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost lost my taste for pictures or music. Music generally sets me thinking too energetically on what I have been at work on, instead of giving me pleasure. My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts; but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain alone on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive.3 This frank avowal is most significant, for it shows us the extension of the dry rot from the religious instincts to the aesthetic emotions, and thus serves to make plain the process of decay in faith. It is com600ly thought that faith dies a sudden and violent death. But here, in 'How manuscripts discovered in Pompeii (destroyed A.D. 79 could-alter the type of evidence afforded now by the Gospels, I find it hard to see. 2 More Letters, i. 194. 'Life, i. 100. 2E</page><page sequence="11">434 Studies. [SEPT. the case of Darwin, disbelief stole very slowly and im per300tibly over him by a kind of creeping paralysis. His faith was not killed by facts, nor even was it demolished by theories; it simply died a natural death, as did his appreciation of art, music, and. poetry. In neither case was it a question' of argument or logic; the process was one of spiritual atrophy. Darwin was reduced to a kind hearted old man with a collection of pigeonholes, crammed with data and theories, instead of a soul. I might, had I time, make a similar analysis of the unbelief of Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, and George Eliot. There clearly emerges the rather curious phenomenon that in all these cases the unbelief preceded the investigation of the relevant facts. And thus when I am told that such and such a one has suddenly lost the faith by reading a book or by dissecting a slug, I do not for a moment believe that this is the full explanation. His faith was for years being slowly under mined by his own carelessness, it was atrophied from mere disuse, and when the shock came it snapped. Mind, I do not say that every unbeliever is leading a bad life; that would be a grossly unfair accusation. But ,I do say that faith is generally lost by disuse or neglect. If you were to lose your eye or your hand, it might be through some disease or cancer. But it is also quite possible to lose it through mere atrophy and want of functioning, in a word, through sheer local starvation. Now faith is sight.' You may lose your spiritual sight by -acquiring some moral disease, or you may lose it simply by living always in the dark. Men lose their faith because they become blind colourblind, as Darwin pathetically puts jt.2 And if we want to keep our faith and to increase it, our life is more important than our facts. 1Habet namque fides oculos suos quibus quodarumodo videt verum esso quod nondum videt et quibus certissimo videt nonclum so videre quod credit.-St. Augustine, Ep. 12O 28 ; Goldbaeher, 34, 711. 21 Life, 1. 311.</page><page sequence="12">[017. Faith and Facts. 43' For, just as faith is not lost through facts, so neither is it gained. What I mean is this: even if you put the facts patently before an unbeliever, you could not induce him to believe-unless the process were accompanied by a moral and spiritual regeneration. And to prove this, I will take again a concrete illustration-the miracles at Lourdes. I might have chosen our Lord's Resurrection, but for the sake of brevity I take the cures at Lourdes, without wishing in any way to imply that a Catholic' is bound to regard them as miraculous. At the very least, the cures are a most extraordinary historical fact and ought to be in vestigated with care and' reverence and interest. Yet, in' spite of every facility, the leading men of science have shown a lamentable failure to get even within measurable distance of appreciating the evidence. On the part of specialists who profess scientific method and culture, we find flippant amateurish incompetence, we find almost incredible distortion and bias, we find a pathetic inability to appreciate the significance of any facts which clash with their apriori prejudices. We find, in short, that the bigwigs of science are just as weak and human as the most uneducated peasant-indeed a great deal more so. Huxley examined the question of Lourdes as a bit of "mental recreation" during a rest-cure in 1873. "I need hardly add," says Sir Joseph Hooker,' that he "soon arrived at the conclusion that the so-called miracles were in part illusions and for the rest delusions." This is his account : It was a case of two peasant children sent, in the hottest 600th of the year, into a hot valley to collect sticks for firewood washed up by a stream, when one of them after stooping down opposite a heat-reverberating rock, was in rising attacked with a transient vertigo, under which she saw a figure in white against the rock. This hare fact being reported to the cure' of the village, all the rest followed. 1 Huxley's Life, i. 391. 2E2</page><page sequence="13">486 Studies. [SEPT. One feels inclined to add "Q.E.D." to this neat geo metrical refutation. Unfortunately for the eminent zoologist and the distinguished botanist, the time was early in February and an ex300tionally cold day, so that Bernadette Soubirous did not want to paddle across the stream. And the cure' did his best to thwart and discourage the visions and thoroughly approved of the police regula tions and restrictions.' These facts will not fit into Huxleys heat-and-priest hypthesis; so much the worse for the facts It would, be tedious to enumerate similar "scientific" accounts of Lourdes. I may instance an article of Sir Henry Morris, ex-President of the Royal College of Surgeons, which the British Medical Journal considered sufficiently British, medical and journalistic to publish.' A600g other incorrect statements, borrowed at second hand, he tells us that "the lower classes and the peasant ignorance had to be enlightened . . . by appealing to the imagination and the superstition of these folks." Hence was inaugurated "a replica on a larger scale and in a place accessible to the whole country of the worship of Notre Dame des Victoires in Paris." Unfor tunately for this eminent surgeon, Lourdes was an out of-the-way village, 600 miles from Paris, shut off from Spain by the Pyrenees, and over eighty miles from the nearest railway. How true it is that the moment we pass beyond the com600place and impersonal, everything depends on our previous attitude to the supra-normal. Even the mere admission of the relevant -facts does not constitute belief. In an editorial article in the same Medical Journal,2 we read: "The sudden healing of a face destroyed by lupus-in one case with,' in another without, scarring-facts vouched for by Boissarie and by Huysmans, who saw the patients, is altogether outside ordinary experience. But it is not therefore necessarily a re suit of supernatural intervention." Precisely; inconvenient 2 Pae 1403a June 18, 1910, P. 1460. g</page><page sequence="14">1017.j Faith and Facts. 487 facts can easily be naturalised by coining the necessary Greek medical terms. Emile Zola saw several cures at Lourdes, in particular a permanent cure from pul600ary tuberculosis. Then he wrote a novel called Lourdes, in which this particular patient-still alive in 1915-is repre sented as having relapsed and died. "I suppose I am master of the persons in my own books," said the novelist to Dr. Boissarie,' " and can let them live or die as I chose." "And besides," he added, "I don't believe in miracles; even if all the sick in Lourdes were cured in one moment, I would not believe in them." And this is the man to whom Haeckel referred as the greatest authority on Lourdes. Could anything prove more conclusively that facts will not make faith How futile it is to strive to obtain credence for our faith merely by proving its grounds of credibility. And now, fresh from this very modern discussion, let us open our New Testament and turn to the ninth chapter of St. John. Perhaps we shall find in it a new meaning and message to help us in our modern difficulties. In the cure of the man born blind2 we have a miracle which more than fulfils Huxley's test-conditions. The questions which the present age asks about the miracles of Jesus are in this instance asked and answered in presence of the facts themselves. First, there was a friendly discussion a600g the man's neighbours and acquaintances, whose surprise took the natural form of doubting his identity. This doubt being dispelled, they inquired how the cure happened. "I went," said the man simply; "I washed my eyes, I gained my sight." Then there was an appeal to the Leaders of Science, to the Sanhedrin-the Royal Society, we might say and a commission was held. Their argument was: The sabbath-law is true, therefore the miracle did not happen. Our modern counterparl is: Natural law is true, therefore the miracle did 'Jorgensen: Lourdes, Eng. tr. (1014), p. 179. 2The only naturally curable congenital blindness would be cataract-and that by a surgical operation.</page><page sequence="15">488 Studies. [SEPTO not happen. All the details given by St. John must to his contemporaries have seemed mere archaeo logical pedantry; but to us how real, how living, how apposite. The same parties, the same disputes are familiar to us. In presence of the very same facts we see on the one .hand the growth of faith-the acquirement not only of physical sight but of mental vision; and on the other side we see the Leaders of Science growing more and more hardened and prejudiced. And we have the judgement of Christ on Faith and Facts: "It was to test men that I came into this world-that those who do not see may see, that those who do see may become blind." Hearing this, some of the Professors asked: "Then are we blind too ", That is, do you mean to say that we, the great lights of science, are as blind as was this man before you cured him "If you were blind," answered our Lord, "you would have no sin. But, as it is, you claim to see; so your sin remains!"' Turn back to St. John's third chapter, to realise once more that faith is a gift of God, a power of vision which no amount of scientific study can by itself attain. In Christ's interview with Nicodemus we have the man of facts brought face to face with faith. "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless a man is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God." That was a real uncompromising statement of faith. Had Christ been a mere ambitious enthusiast, he would surely have stretched his prihciples to accommodate such a distinguished convert. Not so, however; there is only one road for learned and for un lettered. Listen to the bald answer of the scientific mind. "How can a man be born when he is old?" asked Nico demus. That is the kind of answer which settles matters for the man of science; it is so clear, so simple. And again said Nicodemus, "How can these things be?" Not the kind of man for starting a great religious movement. He 1 1 have, for the purpose of illustration, used a free rendering in modern phraseology.</page><page sequence="16">1917 Faith and Facts. 480 knew all about the Law and its formulae, tithes of mint and anise, Temple cere600ies. A good honest man, full of his lectures and researches, dense to the things of the spirit, untouched by religious enthusiasm. What was all this talk about a new birth, about a rustling in one's heart, about the stirring of the Spirit Lest we too, like Nicodemus, go out into the night unquickened and unenlightened, St. John sums up the lesson of the interview in words which may well serve as a summary of our discussion: "The Light has yome into the World. But men preferred darkness to the Light, because their deeds were evil." It sounds a harsh judge ment, does it not But remember it is the Gospel message. Of course we must not interpret it to mean that every unbelieyer is an evildoer. But the sentence does assert that the Light has come into the world and that men prefer darkness to the Light, not-observe----because the light has gone out, not because the world is plunged in religious darkness, not because there is anything wrong with the facts'; but because there is something wrong with them selves, they cannot see the light, they are blind. And we' have this consoling addition, that "he who acts up to the truth comes to the Light"; every fragment of good done is so much truth made visible. If Christ 'is hard to see for the modern world, the difficulty does not come from science properly so called, it comes from human selfish ness, greed and pride. ALFRED RAIIILLY.</page></plain_text>
