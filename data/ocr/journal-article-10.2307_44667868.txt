Pellettiere Human Effectiveness Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory Zhiqing Cheng General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems ABSTRACT Modeling and simulation of complex biomechanical systems can be developed to provide insight into the loading of otherwise immeasurable conditions. Ejection from an aircraft is a highly dynamic event with a risk of injury during the entire sequence. During one of the phases of ejection, spinal compression injury is a definite possibility and test manikins are used to asses this risk. However, care must be taken before accepting the relationship between the measured load in a manikin an the assumed load in a human. Human impact tests are often conducted to asses the biodynamics at a sub-injury level. Correlating these human biodynamics with manikin dynamics, can provide this relationship. To complete this correlation, modeling and simulation can be used to augment the available human test data so that the parameters of interest can be calculated. To this end, a rigid body dynamics model was constructed to represent a vertical impact for both humans and manikins. This model was then validated through human impact test data and a method was developed to demonstrate how to build this correlative relationship. This method is a very robust and direct way to calculate the internal lumbar load for human testing. INTRODUCTION During seat ejection, the aircrew is subject to a large +Gz impact and thus has the risk of spinal injury. The vertebral breaking strength has been shown to be a good indicator of human tolerance limit for spinal injuries [1]. This strength is directly proportional to both bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral cross-section area (CSA) [2], and is significantly different for males and females [3]. To use this criterion to evaluate the risk of spinal injury, it is necessary to know the vertebral stress resulting from an impact. The vertebral stress is approximately equal to the vertebral force divided by the CSA. The vertebral force response thus becomes a major concern for aircrew subject to the vertical impact. With the recently expanded weight and height requirements of the US Air Force pilot population, Air Force researchers are concerned that females and individuals at the outer size extremes may be at increased risk of spinal injury during aircraft ejections. Therefore, a project was conducted at the AFRL/HEPA to study the dynamic vertebral stress with respect to gender and anthropometric factors. Compared with typical human impact test programs, this study had a fairly large sample size; participants included 21 male and 24 female test subjects. Each subject underwent two types of testing. One was to use high speed CT scanning to measure the BMD and CSA, and the other was to conduct +Gz impact tests to measure human responses. To evaluate the safety performance of ejection seat cushions, Vertical Deceleration Tower (VDT) tests are conducted with manikin and human subjects. While a manikin can be equipped with a load cell to measure the lumbar force, the vertebral force response cannot be measured directly for human subjects. Instead, acceleration responses are measured externally at certain body regions (e.g., the head and chest). However, it is desirable and important to determine the human vertebral force response from these measurements. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop the methodologies for determining the human vertebral force response from the accelerations at certain exterior body regions and to establish the relationship between the lumbar force and anthropometrry. PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND METHOD The occupant response in the VDT tests depends upon the following factors: • Impact conditions, which are the G-level, the duration of impact pulse, and the shape of the pulse; • Occupant biomechanics. A human and a manikin will have different biomechanics, even though a manikin is designed to have maximum bio-fidelity. The human biomechanics differ for each subject, depending upon the gender, height, weight, and other anthropometric factors. 1670</page><page sequence="2">• Boundary conditions, which include the seat cushion, harness belt and lap belt, helmet and oxygen mask, and other restraints applied on the occupant. • Initial conditions, which refer to the initial positioning of the occupant, the initial extension load in the belt, etc. For the human tests and manikin tests, it is possible for both to have the same or very close impact conditions, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. If so, then the differences can be reasonably ascertained between the human response and the manikin response and these are a result of the differences in biomechanics between a human and a manikin. The Articulated Total Body (ATB), a rigid multi-body dynamics program, is used for the modeling and simulation of the VDT Tests. A generic model is developed for the description of the scenario of a 50th percentile Hybrid III male manikin in the VDT tests. This model is validated against the tests for various conditions by comparing the simulation results with test data in terms of certain major responses, such as the chest and head accelerations, and the lumbar load. The Generator of Body Data (GEBOD) program, an automatic human body data generation program, is used to generate the required mass data for the particular ATB model of each human testing subject according to respective anthropometrical data. By replacing the occupant model in the validated ATB model with this particular occupant model, a base model for the modeling of this human subject in the VDT tests is created. The simulated responses of this model are compared with the measured responses from tests. By adjusting the joint properties, especially those for the joints connecting the head and the neck, the upper torso to middle torso, and the middle torso to lower torso, the discrepancy between the simulation results and test data is minimized in terms of certain major responses, such as the head and chest accelerations. Given the measured acceleration responses of the chest, head, and other body regions, the determination of human vertebral force response became an inverse problem, which could be solved using identification. Based on the statistic analysis of 279 human tests, the relationship between the vertebral force response and anthropometrics is established and represented by linear regression models. MODELING AND VALIDATION OCCUPANT SIMULATION The Articulated Total Body (ATB) Model is used by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and other organizations, companies, and educational institutions for predicting gross human body response in various dynamic environments, especially automobile crash and aircraft ejection with windblast exposure. The ATB Model originated from the Crash Victim Simulation (CVS) program [4]). Aerodynamic force application and a harness belt capability were added to the CVS program by Calspan Corporation in 1975 for AFRL [5], and the resulting program became known as the ATB model. In 1980, Calspan made a number of modifications to the ATB Model, combining it with the then-current 3-D Crash Victim Simulation program to form the ATB-II Model [6]. Complete documentation of the program through the ATB-II version was performed by Calspan [7,8,9,10]. The next version, ATB-III, which included improvements made by J&amp;J Technologies, Inc., was generated to model the body response to windblast for AFRL [1 1]. The version ATB-IV [12,13] was released in 1988 with a number of additional efforts being made to improve various aspects of the ATB-III Model, with emphasis on its capability to simulate aircraft ejection with windblast exposure, as well as complex automobile accidents. The Articulated Total Body Model is primarily designed to evaluate the three-dimensional dynamic response of a system of bodies when subjected to a dynamic environment consisting of applied forces and interactive contact forces. Although the ATB Model was originally developed to model the dynamic response of crash dummies and, with later modifications, the response of the human, the ATB Model is quite general in nature and can be used to simulate a wide range of physical problems that can be approximated as a system of connected or free bodies. The ATB Model has been used to model such widely diverse physical phenomena as a human body dynamics, the motion of the balls in a billiards game, and the transient response of an MX missile suspended from cables in a wind tunnel. Version V further expands the model's capabilities to include water force simulation with personal flotation device, robotic motion simulation, and deformable segment modeling. This flexibility in the ATB Model can cause the application of the ATB program to appear to be overly complex to the uninitiated user. The ATB 31 software package was used to simulate the occupant motion. ATB 31 is a PC-based environment incorporating the Articulated Total Body (ATB) model, version V.1 [14], with a graphical user interface for pre- and post- processing. Occupant Model The Generator of Body Data (GEBOD) program, version IV, [15]) was used to generate the properties for the simulated occupants for the ATB model (Figure 1). GEBOD used a set of 32 body dimensions to compute the joint center locations and the segment sizes, masses and principal moments of inertia. Ellipsoids are used to represent the segment geometry for contact purposes. 1671</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1. Typical ATB Model Generated by GEBOD The typical model generated by GEBOD has either 15 or 17 segments, depending on if the hands are modeled as separate entities. The user can choose from a variety of available datasets, including adult human males and females and a variety of manikins. Modeling of Manikin Tests The manikin is a 50th percentile Hybrid III. The ATB model of this manikin was built according to the design and test data [16]. It has 17 segments and 16 joints. The model includes the harness belt but not the lap belt. The role of lap belt is not significant in terms of lumbar load and upper body response. A slip joint with angular free and linear unlocked is used for the joint between the lower torso and middle torso and for the joint between the middle torso and upper torso. A spring and a damper are also placed at these two locations, respectively, to represent the resilience of the spine. In the VDT tests, the occupant is seated on the seat pan with a cushion or without a cushion. A quasi-linear, visco-elastic model is used to characterize the contact properties between the occupant and the seat pan or seat cushion. Figure 2. ATB modeling of VDT tests Figure 3. Manikin VDT simulation results The developed model was validated after verifying the major response signals of interest matched within an acceptable tolerance. Visual comparison of the simulation results with the test results demonstrates a high level of agreement (Figure 3). The negative time in the figures corresponds to the free fall period. The upper left figure is the comparison for the vertical chest accelerations. The upper right is for the vertical head acceleration. The lower left is for the lumbar load in the upward direction, and the lower right is for the comparison between the vertical seat pan force from test and the normal contact force between the occupant and the seat pan from the simulation. The large difference shown in this figure is because of the inertial effect of the seat pan in the test. In the model, the mass of the seat pan is not included as part of the calculation. Overall, the simulation results have attained sound agreement with the test data. This indicates that the model is a good description of the system. We can use this model to define the impact, boundary, and initial conditions of the system. Modeling of Human Tests The development of the human VDT model was a simpler process than the development of the manikin model. The goal of the human VDT model was one which had the same test conditions as the manikin model. Because of this, it was necessary only to replace the manikin occupant with a human occupant, much the same way as the actual testing is conducted. Since the test conditions, which involve impact conditions, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, have been well defined by the validated model of the manikin test, the only remaining issue for the model of the human test is to determine the properties of the joints between the lower torso and middle torso and between the middle torso and the upper torso in the human model. Before carrying out this process for subject populations, a single case was investigated. The identification process was applied to human subject L- 1672</page><page sequence="4">15; G-level 10 g; no-cushion (Figure 4). The negative time in the figures denotes the free fall period. The sound agreement between the simulation results and test data for the chest acceleration, head acceleration, and seat pan / seat cushion force indicates that the model has the ability to predict (backward), with acceptable accuracy, the human responses at the exterior locations of the body. Therefore, the assumption is made that this model can also be used to predict (backward) the lumbar load. As such, the lumbar load is identified or determined. The identified lumbar load for this test is shown in the upper left figure. Figure 4. Human VDT simulation results Correlation between Manikin and Human Vertebral Force Response For the manikin tests, standard 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile manikins are often used. But for the human tests, either female or male human subjects can vary in a large range of height, weight, and other anthropometric parameters. Therefore, the correlative relationship between the manikin and human vertebral force responses or lumbar loads should not be on the one-to- one basis. Instead, it should be based on the one-to-one group match-up. That is to • Divide human subjects into three groups of small, middle, and large based on weight; • Obtain mean lumbar load for each group by averaging identified lumbar load of all subjects in the group; • Determine the correlative relationship between one percentile manikin and the corresponding human subject group. Initial results indicate that fairly sound correlations can be established. Here is an example which was still performed between one manikin test and one human test. DISCUSSION- A NOVEL APPROACH FOR PREDICTING HUMAN RESPONSE FROM ATD TESTS Impact biomechanical tests play an important role in the studies of injury, crashworthiness, and safety. Since cadaver, animal and volunteer testing all carry with them potential ethical difficulties that can constrain the amount or type of testing that can be performed [17], Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs), such as the Hybrid III manikin, have been widely used in the biomechanical tests. The development of ATDs has gone through a long process, and the biofidelity of ATDs has been improved throughout this process [18, 19, 20] While an ATD is designed to mimic human response subject to impact, its biofidelity is often limited. As a consequence, biomechanical responses from the tests with ATDs and from the tests with human subjects are not always quite agreeable. Thus, a frequently asked question is how to predict human responses from an ATD test for the given biofidelity of the ATD; in other words, how to improve the biofidelity of the prediction of human response based on ATD tests? The question is related to the relationship between the human tests and ATD tests. The relationship between the human response and the ATD response will be considered only when both human and ATD are subject to the same or very similar impact conditions, boundary conditions, and initial conditions, such as was done in the test and simulation program described earlier. Then the differences can be reasonably judged between the human response and the ATD response and these differences result from the differences in biomechanics between the human and the ATD. From a viewpoint of system analysis, the problems of this kind are conventionally handled in terms of the transfer functions of human and ATD and the relationship between the transfer functions. However, because of the complexity of a biomechanical system, the variety in impact conditions, boundary conditions, and initial states, and the nonlinearity of occupant biomechanics, it is not feasible or even possible to determine these transfer functions based on the input- output relationship of the system. Alternatively, the problem could be solved based on the occupant response only. Comparative tests between the human and the ATD are often performed for a range of conditions, and the human response and the ATD response are produced and acquired under the same conditions within the range. One idea is to establish the relationship between the human response and the ATD response via a signal analysis of them as a pair. This relationship can be used for the prediction of human response from the ATD tests, or, in other words, 1673</page><page sequence="5">mapping the ATD response into human response, within the test range (interpolation) and out of the range (extrapolation) with certain restraints. Impact response, such as automobile crash response and seat ejection response, are transient, strongly localized in the time domain, and are often contaminated with noise. As a consequence, conventional statistical analysis, correlation analysis, or spectral analysis used for stationary signals may be neither appropriate nor efficient for the analysis of impact responses. As a new tool for signal analysis, wavelets are localized in both frequency and time domains, which match the major characteristics of transient impact responses. Work has progressed on developing this for validating simulations with test data [21-23]. The wavelet methodology has provided an avenue for decomposing signals into their basic properties, such that a comparison of the responses of interest can be conducted. A visualization of this methodology (Figure 5) demonstrates that the single signal is decomposed into several signals, but each with different properties. This Figure 5. Decomposition in a wavelet basis and a wavelet packet basis will enable the correlation analysis to be conducted on only the decomposed signals, thus eliminating higher frequency errors and responses that are not of interest. Conducting the wavelet analysis on different sets of data as outlined here has been shown to greatly improve the correlation coefficient [24]. This improvement is not just a mathematical abstraction. It is derived from comparing the important parts of the signals and correlating those properties of interest. The entire procedure includes: • Decomposing the response on a wavelet or wavelet packet basis. • De-noising to remove noise and compressing to simplify the response representation. • Decomposing both signals on a wavelet packet basis at the same level to get approximations and details (sub-signals). • Energy distribution analysis of both signals to determine the energy contribution of each sub- signal. • Correlation analysis between the two approximations and linear regression analysis between them to establish the relationship between them. • Spectral coherence analysis or correlation analysis of a pair of sub-signals with significant energy contributions to determine the relationship between them. If linear relationship exists, determining the transfer function via FFT or scaling coefficient via regression. • If linear relationship does not exist for the entire time duration, segmenting the sub- signals over evenly divided time spans. For a pair of segments with significant energy contributions, spectral coherence analysis or correlation analysis to determine the relationship between them. If linear relationship exists, determining the transfer function via FFT or scaling coefficient via regression. • Summarizing the coefficients for the approximations and details to form the mapping matrix. • From the wavelet decompositions of the ATD response, with the mapping matrix, reconstructing the signal to obtain the prediction of human response. • Statistical analysis for a range to obtain statistical parameters for the mapping matrix. CONCLUSIONS From this study, a method was developed to determine the human lumbar load by using ATB modeling and simulation. The correlative relationship 1674</page><page sequence="6">between the identified human lumbar load and the measured manikin lumbar load was also established for a specific case. To expand this relationship to general terms, modeling and simulation is necessary for all human subjects (21 male and 24 female in total) and the entire series of tests (279 tests in total). Then, based on the relationship established, predictions can be made of the human lumbar load from the manikin tests. If possible, a final validation of this method introduced should be completed with post mortem human subjects. During the modeling process, some potential errors in the GEBOD database were uncovered. One major problem is that the joint locations of the model generated by GEBOD may not be in the correct locations, especially when the model is generated from user- supplied 32 body dimensions. Further investigations and modifications to GEBOD to ascertain these differences are warranted. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are very grateful to the volunteer subjects who made this study possible.
