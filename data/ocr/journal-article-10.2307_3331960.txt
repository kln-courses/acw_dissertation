<plain_text><page sequence="1">Films and a Novel Future GEORGE W. LINDEN If I am to believe my senses, I should be weaving a funeral wreath, not writing a paper on the future of the novel. Our latest Nobel Prize winner for literature, Samuel Beckett, has announced glumly that the novel is dead. That oracular pundit of media, Marshall McLuhan, coolly assures us that we are all anachronistic remnants of the printed age. He declares that we have entered the electronic age, the post- literate generation, where, according to his insight, "the light bulb is pure information." We are, he tells us, members of a vast global village where the area of privacy and the era of book culture are dead. Technicians inform us of the glittering possibilities of computers. They tell us that we are on the brink of instant history when books will be replaced by microfilms and electronic facsimile transmission. All we really will need is not world enough, but TV screen enough and time. In the meantime, Fahrenheit 451 is (ironically) translated into a flimsy film, and we watch multicolored images of the future guardians of morality rushing to secret coves to burn the vessels of sin and depravity: books. Whether these gloomy predictions are facts or fictions does not con- cern me. My intuition tells me that the novel does indeed have a future. After all, if we are to believe Gene Youngblood,l films, as we have known them, have no future either. Since I believe that both films and novels have a future, I shall look briefly at some of their relations in our time. My aim shall be to try to discern some of the developing directions of the novel, perhaps even its future form. The GEORGE W. LINDEN is professor of philosophy at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. He has written numerous articles on film and aesthetics as well as a volume, Reflections on the Screen. His article "Ten Questions About Film Form" was published in JAE's Film II issue (April 1971).</page><page sequence="2">56 GEORGE W. LINDEN fact that I myself am not a novelist or filmmaker should be no argu- ment against my looking, and may even be an argument for it. I re- mind you of Socrates' dictum that it takes sterile hands to bring all new things properly to birth. If we look at the novel in our time, the situation appears bleak. Not only have the majority of the novels retreated from the world, but many of them have also retreated from the very materials of the novel itself. In another context,2 I have termed this the decline of the novel as an art form. I argued that this expiration apparently takes four general directions: the movement toward facticity, the emphasis upon the consequential, the cataloging of the problematic, and the novelistic sketch. Although I now feel that these are symptoms of change, not necessarily of decline, perhaps it may be helpful to review these four phases and relate them to film before turning to predictions of the future. The movement toward facticity is best exemplified by the so-called journalistic novel or novel of pseudo-history. Truman Capote claims that this is a new art form, but the only evidence for this claim is his own declaration. If we were to use a term from another art, film, we might call this the documentary novel. Here the emphasis is upon event and verisimilitude. Such works as In Cold Blood and The Con- fessions of Nat Turner are examples of this genre. Norman Mailer's Armies of the Night, like its film counterpart, Medium Cool, is a mixed case since it purports to be both fact and fiction. Mailer mixes the two so well that it is difficult to tell one from the other. These books retain the love of language and vivid description common to the novel. They retain the hero as the main character. (Mailer is always his own hero but not always at his best; see Beyond The Law.) They even include imaginative constructions of what might or could have been the case; they retain plot and thematic development, but their main aim is at a factual ground. Hence, they become reconstructions of "actual" occurrences. The documentary novel has its narrative line and main structure determined for it by external fact though its internal events- their compression or expansion - may be imaginative. They thus differ from historical romances such as Oliver Wiswell, which have factual cir- cumstances but fictional plots and horizons. Though including imagi- native construction, this mode of the novel moves within the horizon of presentational fact and hence is distinguished by its overall aim at facticity, as distinguished from the purely fictive. These works are</page><page sequence="3">FILMS AND A NOVEL FUTURE 57 structurally factual, though their episodes may be pure reconstruction. They thus go beyond both the historical romance and the "realistic" novel of the Twenties and Thirties in their drive toward authenticity - an authenticity which is dependent upon historic validation. Another direction the novel has taken in our time involves the mass- ing of sequential events. This I have termed the emphasis on the con- sequential. In film, we would call it the blockbuster, or the epic movie. This movement is perhaps best exemplified by John Barth, whose Giles Goat-Boy is a prime instance of the trend. One has the impression when he reads Giles that Barth wrote the brilliant parody of Oedipus first and then wrote the rest of the novel out in both directions to justify the parody. Here depth development of character and narrative line are suppressed. The world of the novel becomes episodic, events come to the foreground, and emphasis is upon the clever construction of endlessness. The form of this novel can thus be imagined as a neck- lace of brilliant beads which are often merely externally and tenuously strung together. Cumulative tension is sacrificed for occasional im- provisation; wit becomes more important than texture or language. In spite of the vivid events and acerbic asides, Giles Goat-Boy is a peculiarly aseptic novel. A somewhat warmer and more engaging work, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.'s Cat's Cradle, might also be included in this type design. Another example, certainly in terms of mass, would be Larry McMurtry's Moving On. A third direction is what Nathan A. Scott, Jr., has termed "The New Mystique of L'Actuelle."3 This direction I have called the cata- loging of the problematic. It would seem at first that this is contradic- tory to the direction taken by Barth, but it is actually merely a contrary. Both share a deemphasis upon narrative meaning. Barth develops this by playing with events; Alain Robbe-Grillet almost eliminates them. Nevertheless, they share a common ground in their opposition to the symbolic nature of the novel. The works of both are anti-depth, anti- texture, and basically anti-humanistic. Robbe-Grillet goes further, however, for he is also anti-plot, anti-story, anti-character, and anti- eloquence. As he has said: "It's a question of something else from now on. It has become impossible to narrate.... In short, it isn't events that are lacking, it is only their character of certainty, their tranquility and their innocence."4 He means by this that the sheer movement of writing must now replace narrative. He views previous novels as hope- lessly anthropomorphic; his cry (taken from philosophy) is "To the things themselves!" This attempt to create le roman objectif means</page><page sequence="4">58 GEORGE W. LINDEN that the author must negate any determinate stance and must try to present things in their simple thereness. One must, insists Robbe-Grillet, renounce and abandon "the cult of the human" and "look at the world which surrounds us with unprejudiced eyes." This stance is vividly reminiscent of that of Clive Bell, who constantly warned us not to wallow in the valley of jolly humanity. Robbe-Grillet's novels are almost entirely visual. His appeal is to the eyes, and he writes in terms of scenes with quick cuts, intercuts, repetition, and discontinuity. He thus creates novels of ambiguity and indeterminacy whose idealistic texture involves the destruction of time. Narrative is reduced to the multi-leveled now. The counterpart in films would be the abstract art film exemplified by some of the work of Resnais (Hiroshima, Mon Amour; Last Year at Marienbad), Godard (Band of Outsiders; China Is Near), or Bergman (Winter Light; The Silence; Passion of Anna; Persona; Cries and Whispers; but not Wild Strawberries or The Seventh Seal). Jealousy, The House of Assignation, and Last Year at Marienbad cannot be regarded as novels of the absurd. In the novel of the absurd, distance becomes separation, division becomes dichotomy, aspiration becomes irony, and man's fate- which is still present--becomes a form of tragic humanism. The heroes of Sartre and Camus feel de- prived; not so the characters in the works of Robbe-Grillet. The absence of meaning is neither an opportunity nor a threat. Robbe-Grillet states: "And the man of today (or tomorrow...) feels no sense of deprivation or affliction at this absence of meaning. He no longer feels lost at the idea of such a vacuum. His heart no longer needs to take refuge in an abyss. For if he rejects communion, he rejects tragedy."5 For Sartre the world is malevolent; for Robbe-Grillet it is indeterminate. Thus he insists upon the cataloging of possible facts, and man's problem is not one of relating to these "suppositional facts" in any way, either positive or negative. Happy agreement and unhappy warfare are both rejected. In fact (pun intended), all complicity is rejected. Thus Robbe-Grillet: "In the first place we reject the vocabulary of analogy and of tradi- tional humanism, at the same time rejecting the idea of tragedy, and any other idea that leads to the belief that men, or ideas (or both), have a profound, and superior, nature, and finally we reject any pre- established order."6 The intense heat of the Algerian sun was Mer- sault's accomplice. Robbe-Grillet's anti-hero might or might not be sunburned. Michel Butor and Robbe-Grillet desire (although perhaps "desire"</page><page sequence="5">FILMS AND A NOVEL FUTURE 59 is too human a word) that their novels, like MacLeish's poem, not mean but be. But there is a significant difference between the stances of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Archibald MacLeish. MacLeish is insisting upon the fusion of value in the object, Robbe-Grillet on its subjectiviza- tion. MacLeish is not out to eliminate value, but to diminish human subjectivity while at the same time tracing, presenting, the objective structure of value in the world. For example, in Hamlet, he says, "I always think that trees know the way they are silent," and, more to the point, "A poem should be equal to:/Not true." The globed fruit of literature, then, is itself but engenders reverberation in us. For Robbe-Grillet, however, no sound is transmitted, for given communion is impossible. The last direction of the current novel is the novelistic sketch. These novels read as if they were not written or, to use Capote's phrase, even typed. They have the look of being dictated. Such works tend to be shallow and slipshod; their appeal rests, if it rests at all, on vivid or salacious content. Candy, Myra Breckenridge, and Last Exit to Brook- lyn are instances of this genre. Portnoy's Complaint might also be in- cluded, though I would exclude Couples, since it has deeper thematic substance and also a far more creative use of language. These books deemphasize character, eloquence, and narrative sequence, though they do have improvised plots. In spite of their emphasis upon erotic fleshly incident, the novels themselves have the form of incomplete skeletons- as if they were designed as shooting scripts. Though the content may occasionally be vivid, they are spare in structure and per- haps really should be regarded as educational tracts. Their counter- part in film is pornography. This points up an interesting relation between the didactic and the pornographic. If we are talking about the novel, both can simply be classified as bad writing, for both make the medium subject to external intentions. But they have another element in common: the spareness which is due to fixation. This fixation is due to the deliberate reduction of meaning. To define and to fix authoritatively only one meaning or one set of meanings to a work is to reduce it and to kill it. All art, insofar as it is art, is double-talk. It can and often does convey a con- scious set of intentions. But its ultimate structure rests on the tension between those conscious meanings and the unconscious or mythological dimensions of the work. These latter dimensions reveal symbols "like life, which they unfold from dark to light, are there, 'thus come' from the sphere beyond 'meaning on all levels at once.' "7 It is this level of</page><page sequence="6">60 GEORGE W. LINDEN the waking dream which Joyce mined and from which he hoped to forge the "uncreated conscience of his race." The real danger of these reductive works is not that they will corrupt our youth by vivid images, but, on the contrary, that they may render them numb. Novels of this type, like people who are strident or in a hurry, tend to suffer from and induce anesthesia. If we reflect upon the intentionality of the form of these novels, we can discover that they reflect and project the problems of modern man. While they pose as new directions or as new approaches to the world, what they accomplish is another form of withdrawal -withdrawal from the realm of fantasy and imagination, from the realm of feeling. This turning away from human emotion by either trying to identify with indeterminate "fact" or trying to reduce feeling, is symptomatic of our age, which displays tremendous pressures toward such with- drawal. Two sources of anesthesis are speed and complexity. Society has always changed, but in our times change itself has changed. The dynamics of change have accelerated at such an alarming speed that even our facts become incredible. Furthermore, the impact of technol- ogy-both in terms of the new media and space exploration--has brought infinite and instant horizons into direct confrontations with the self. "Not long ago," says John Wilkinson, man conceived himself to be "a unique, rational being, beloved of God and occupying the center of the Cosmos. Through the eyes of Copernicus, Darwin, Freud and their successors, we have learned to view ourselves as spontaneously generated bits of protoplasm, riddled with irrational fears and anxieties, and relegated to a rapidly shrinking rock in an absurdly out-of-the-way corer of the universe."8 Our recent history, then, might be viewed as the progressive abandonment of one preferred position after another. Since the previous centers of value in the West have been in the group-the church, the labor union, the political movement, any quorum-and the group has now dissolved, we find ourselves dis- traught. The universe has moved in on us and left us nowhere to stand. This sense of lack of perspective has also been evident in the various problems faced by the psychoanalysts. In the Forties, the problem was one of anxiety; in the Fifties, alienation. In the mid-Fifties this was transformed into the crisis of identity, and now the current problem is apathy: not being able to feel. One may look upon these as the func- tional results of the quantitative society. The relation between the neurotic and the artistic person is a close one, as Rollo May has pointed out.9 Both are cast into the mold of Cassandra and perform a predictive</page><page sequence="7">FILMS AND A NOVEL FUTURE 61 function. The basis for artists being "historians of the future" is that they speak from the unconscious depths of their society. The difference between neurotic and artistic people is that though both keep in touch with themselves, one does it negatively, the other positively. Hence the neurotic individual "is unable to form his experiences into communi- cable meaning for himself and his fellows"10 and must therefore hire a paid friend (the psychiatrist) to help him articulate his difficulties. The artist, however, refuses to be depersonalized; he creates a com- munity of his own by objectifying his obsessions into a fictional world. Like Jacob, he wrestles with his demon and wins - but not without a wound. Each book is a scar, and the artist pays for his struggle even as he is paid for it. There is a sense in which all of us are paid for our afflictions. The artist responds, speaking back to his affliction and then bringing it to the sphere of sight and sound and imagination. He articulates and ob- jectifies his struggle for resolution and articulation. This objectified process we call the work of art. I am not talking about the artist's intentions here; those are mostly conscious contrivances. I am talking about the intentionality of the work. If we look at the works I have mentioned, we will find a cumulative drive toward withdrawal and apathy. We will find that the novel now presents to us a concrete world in which a universe of feeling has been extinguished. It is a uni- verse which is empty and joyless, which seems suspended in the no- where and paralyzed by a kind of absolute malediction. In short, the modem novel presents us with the destruction of elsewhere. If we take Robbe-Grillet's words not as he intended them, we might have a perceptive assessment of the trends in the novels I have been describing. Robbe-Grillet intends his words as an injunction, but let me use them as a mere description of the "new novel." As for the characters in the novel, they will be able to contain a multiplicity of possible interpretations; they will be open to every sort of comment to suit every sort of prejudice, whether psychological, psychiatric, religious or polit- ical. People will soon perceive their indifference to these so-called riches. Whereas the traditional hero is always being got at, cornered, destroyed, by the author's suggested interpretations, forever being pushed into an intangible and unstable elsewhere, which gets more vague and remote, the future hero will on the contrary remain there. While it will be the comments that will remain else- where; when the hero's presence is indisputable they will seem useless, super- fluous, and even dishonest.11 This description appears quite accurate. What Robbe-Grillet fails to realize is that such a stance implies a dead end. Nothing can be there</page><page sequence="8">62 GEORGE W. LINDEN unless there is an elsewhere. The anywhere is nowhere. Presence and absence are correlative. The disappearance of the literal horizon has affected the literary one. But this does not therefore imply the abdica- tion of the artist. On the contrary, it could equally imply that he should get to work and provide us with new fictional structures. The "new novelist" may battle against such structures, for he fears that limits will restrict his freedom. But such a freedom is a mere waste- land, a mere absence. Tragedy is not the binding of the future and the consequent removal of choice. On the contrary, as Ortega has said, tragedy is the refusal to give up on the future. As he says, "The tragic character is not tragic, and therefore poetic, merely in so far as he is a man of flesh and blood, but only in so far as he wills. The will - that paradoxical object which begins in reality and ends in the ideal, since one only wants what one is not--is the tragic theme."12 The hero, then, is the man who believes in his destiny, the man who refuses to relinquish his ideal projection of himself. This basically resolves itself down to courage. If we are to move away from current sterility and away from the "new novel," then, our novelists must have the courage to create new horizons of fantasy if they are to forge new ideals for man. What is necessary is not withdrawal, but projection; not dehumanization, but personalization. Our other media - TV, film, the telephone - provide us with experiences which are intimate but impersonal. The novel can provide us with projections in which people, not computers, count. What we need are new heroes. This can be accomplished by a move- ment away from intentions and into intentionality. Rollo May de- scribes such a movement when he discusses fantasy: Both fantasy and imagination are capacities by which personal meaning is given an act. Imagination is the home of intentionality and fantasy one of its languages. I use fantasy here not as meaning something unreal to which we escape, but in its original meaning of phantastikous, "able to represent," "to make visible." Fantasy is the language of the total self, communicating, offer- ing itself, trying on for size. It is the language of "I wish/I will" - the pro- jection in imagination of the self into the situation."13 What is needed, above all, is for our novelists to fall in love - not with themselves or their group, but with the world, so they can express its joy in their works. If they can do so, Robbe-Grillet's "new novel" will have become old. Evidence that it has already become old comes from two directions: outer space and inner space, science fiction and Eastern philosophy. As Arthur C. Clarke observed, the landing on the moon did not de-</page><page sequence="9">FILMS AND A NOVEL FUTURE 63 stroy science fiction writers, for they had been beyond the moon for a hundred years already. The Andromeda Strain and 2001 are indica- tions of one direction of the novel of the future. As for Eastern values, they have been appearing in our literature for some time. They appear in garbled form in the works of Kerouac and Kesey, in borrowed form in Salinger. The sudden popularity of Hesse among the young is not to be discounted either. Gods, philosophies, and value systems are not like cups of sugar, however; they cannot be simply borrowed. What will be needed will be a strenuous reworking of the old Western mythos. Our last two great mythological statements were in The Magic Moun- tain (Protestant) and Ulysses (Catholic). Now we will need a syn- thesis of Eastern and Western perspectives. Nor need the author of the new novel worry about whether there will be an audience. The audience will be there. The same technology which has threatened the book culture has also diminished man's status as an appendage to the machine. Machines are serving machines. This same technology may well provide us with total unemployment by the turn of the century. Man may be free to be human in a leisure culture; one aspect of this leisure could be the exploration of the novel. The hero of this new novel will be tough and resilient, but not rigid. He will be a man who has already been there but keeps on going, a man who refuses to identify with the settled habits of the social order or to subject nature to those habits. He will see nature as composed of types of order, though not of human imposition. He will be an indi- vidualist who improvises, who plays the social game but always knows that it is a game. This does not mean that he will not suffer. He may, for on occasion, he may take the game seriously; but he will be able, through force of will, to return to his own flexible stance. In short, he will be a creative and constructive schizoid who finds joy in the dusty world because of its madness. He might even resemble a current example in both novel and film, Yossarian. For once our society seems to be ahead of our artists. The youth movement in America is already attempting new forms of participation in the universe, new concern for ecology and new attempts at mystical and social relations. No doubt many of these attempts may end in failure, but their direction is clear. And to the novelist who is aware, I believe this will appear as a new direction for his art. It will be an art which projects the world not as one of divide and conquer but as one to unite and dance with. It will be a cultivation of human imagination and an expression of the joy of life - a life not lost in indeterminacy</page><page sequence="10">64 GEORGE W. LINDEN or scrubbed clean of all mystery. It will be a novel which does not avoid misery but spreads the good news that man can be defeated and still go on with good cheer. It will be realistic in a total, not a partial, sense. If our novelists lead the way in this new direction it will make all the difference in the world, and in man. If they succeed, perhaps we may be able to relinquish our current enjoyment of alienation and apathy. Perhaps it won't feel so bad to feel so good. Notes 1.
