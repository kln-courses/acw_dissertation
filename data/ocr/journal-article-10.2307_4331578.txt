Images of Animals is itself part of an interdisciplinary series on Animals, Culture, and Society recently started by Temple University Press. While past studies highlighted animals in order to discern changing moral, social, and cultural attitudes within society, more recent interdisciplinary scholarship has increasingly sought to address issues of meaning and agency in the lives of animals. In this thoughtful work, Crist is interested in how the representation of animals, and language, in particular, shapes our understanding of the mental life and actions of animals themselves. Crist's central concern is how development of a technical and causal language of animal behavior, which she locates in the classical etholo- gical tradition of Niko Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz, transforms animals into objects and forecloses serious discussion of animal mind. In contrast, in the writings of naturalists such as Charles Darwin, George and Eliza- beth Peckham, and Jean Henri Fabre, animals appear as individual subjects. In the vernacular language of these naturalists, animals have rich, mean- ingful experiences and are the authors of their own actions. Rather than deprecate anthropomorphism and anecdote, two important elements of turn- of-the-century natural history writing, Crist finds in this tradition a valuable method for capturing the individual, subjective life of animals and affirm- ing an evolutionary continuity between humans and animals. The dismissal of anthropomorphism as metaphorical and unscientific, Crist perceptively points out, is based on the assumption that a neutral language exists or can be developed that will "yield uncontestably objective accounts of animal behavior" (p. 209). What Images of Animals effectively demonstrates, how- ever, is that the technical language of classical ethology and contemporary sociobiology, through terms such as innate releasing mechanism or parental investment, is built upon a skeptical stance toward animal mind that strips animals of individual agency and reduces behavior to nothing more than neurophysiological mechanisms, environmental stimuli, or genetic programs. Animal mind, once a subject to be stringently avoided in behavioral sci- ence, has recently found renewed interest in fields like cognitive ethology and primatology. In an intriguing and controversial claim, Crist attributes part of this revival to the "new anthropomorphism" of sociobiology. While past critics of sociobiology expressed outrage at the application of social-category terms like harem, infanticide, and rape to animals, Crist argues that such criti- cisms offer little substantive moral and epistemological concerns and instead reveal more about the critic's attitudes toward animals. Crist suggests that sociobiology's blending of technical and common language has gone far to break down the animal-human barrier and erode the entrenched skepticism</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 215 about animal mind, even though the reduction of animal actions to a genetic calculus of fitness strategies in sociobiology effaces the inner life of animals. Images of Animals adopts an ethnomethodolgical and sociological approach that is extremely revealing of behavioral writings, but at the same time historically limited. In its juxtaposition and close examination of a select number of authors and historical texts, Images of Animals inadvertently rein- forces a simplistic historical picture of a shift from anthropomorphism to mechanomorphism in twentieth-century behavioral science. But any histor- ical analysis of language must be attentive to both genres and audiences. Darwin, the Peckhams, and Fabre drew upon the conventions of popular natural history writing of their day. Lorenz and Tinbergen, at least in the writ- ings analyzed in Images of Animals, were addressing a much more narrowly self-defined audience with its own emerging conventions. But the lifeworlds of animals in popular natural history and ethology are never far apart. Indi- viduals like Jane Goodall and George Schaller have written of the constraints imposed by the narrative conventions of behavioral science in accounting for the lives of animals. They have fashioned careers that, like the animals they study, inhabit both popular and professional worlds. Sociobiology may have re-opened the door for professional scientists to entertain the subject of animal mind, but pet owners, nature writers, naturalist-photographers, animal trainers, and animal rights groups have been knocking at the door for a much longer time.
