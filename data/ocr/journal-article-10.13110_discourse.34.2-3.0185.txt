Three-dimensional bodies are mere  containers of this mobile entity that is either invisible or flashing,  intermittently, and at the very threshold of the visible. Notice how  the narrative swiftly moves parallel to that soul from place to place,  from life to death, and from sleep to consciousness in a quasi-cine- matographic way. Kinesis is the fixed core of animation. The value  of the anima, or soul, lies in its endless promiscuity, its inability to  be permanently attached to any person, thing, or concept. Such aberrant mobility may also apply to the idea of animism,  a concept that intruded Western territory following ethnographic  descriptions in the second half of the nineteenth century to  describe the religious attitudes of so-called primitive people who  ascribed souls to what Westerners considered as inanimate things.  Perhaps in an attempt to make this idea less strange, anthropolo- gists would compare it with earlier Western philosophical discourses  on the soul, such as Aristotle’s De Anima, Gottfried Wilhelm Leib- niz’s Monadology,1 the animistic theories of the seventeenth-century  medical philosopher G. E. Stahl,2 or the panpsychist theories of  mid-nineteenth-century multiscientists such as Gustav Theodor  Fechner, whose works regained popularity during the fin de siècle.3  Although animation, animism, animatism, and animosity are inde- pendent concepts, they share the same etymological root in the  Latin anima, or soul, based on the Greek ἄνεμος (anemos), mean- ing wind, breeze, or simply, air. But this ethereal origin also dis- closes the enigmatic plasticity of all of these ideas and their ability  to illusively fuse with one another. It was this strange invisible “air”  behind such abstract notions that would fundamentally bewilder  modern scientists. Air suffused everything with an enigmatic buoy- ancy; it made words and things move when they were not supposed  to be swaying. It is as if movement prevailed not only as physical  manifestation but also as an epistemological trope. The first systematic attempt to organize non-Western ideas  about the soul into a religious and philosophical doctrine is pre- sented in Tylor’s voluminous anthropological study Primitive Culture  (1871), a large portion of which is entirely devoted to the principles  of animism.4 “Savages,” according to Tylor, perceive souls every- where: “rivers, stones, trees, weapons and so forth, are treated as liv- ing intelligent beings, talked to, propitiated, punished for the harm  they do.”5 The very idea of the anima is thus associated with a type  of menacing behavior on the part of objects (“the harm they do”),  which is reciprocated by an ambivalent performance (“punished,”  “propitiated,” “talked to”) by the afflicted subject. As Tylor observes,  </page> <page sequence="3"> Movements of the Soul 187 this habit of animated exchange had been already invoked in the  studies on fetishism by De Brosses, as well as David Hume’s Natural  History of Religion, and Auguste Comte’s Philosophie Positive.6 However,  Tylor insists on a distinction between animism and fetishism. Unlike  fetishism, animism does not refer to a singular object; instead, the  anima is a property common to all natural bodies: human, animal,  vegetal, and mineral. Value is produced not by the fixation of power  on a single object, but instead by its constant redistribution among  a collectivity of persons and things. The soul of animism is not the  domineering entity that takes hold of both subjects and objects  in fetishism, but rather is something more subtle, a nonimposing  migrant entity that tends to efface its presence. It is an indistinct  substance evolving from the body—“comparable to the essence and  perfume of a flower,” writes Tylor7—and escaping the confines of  the personal soul. Like a permanently migrating no-body, the anima  traverses the physical and the metaphysical world. It arises not only  in dreams, trances, unconsciousness, phantasms, and hallucinations  but also in echoes, shadows, and reflections—objects that register at  the very threshold of perception. While nearly imperceptible, these souls haunt the mind and  the senses, yet not all of them equally. Indeed, such animation is  more often heard than seen; its sources are auditory rather than  optical. Sound creates an invisible form of movement as it reverber- ates from several corners of a building or an open space, making  the animated source of such echoing noises harder to locate. Early  ethnologists would situate the origin of animistic beliefs in aural  effects of inanimate objects in nature, such as the rustling and  crackling of tree leaves or the wailing of bamboo shoots at night.8  When the spirits appear in the dark room of the shaman, voices are  heard from everywhere; there is “rattling and drumming” on “the  dry reindeer,” “bears growl, snakes hiss and squirrels leap about in  the room.” No doubt “it was the spirits who were drumming, growl- ing, and hissing.”9 This “hissing” sound might explain why “kettles”  and “locomotives” are the most frequent technological artifacts to  be included in these animistic descriptions:10 the pneuma appears  in the form of vapor inside the metallic tube. The anima has many  objects working in its service, for the soul itself is always migrating,  moving, shifting. Movement is key for the perception of the anima. Everything  in motion—the rivers, the stars, the sea, the sun, the moon, light  itself—is animated. Contemporary natural philosophy would in  fact agree with the primitive belief that movement is an essential  vital force and therefore coincides with life: </page> <page sequence="4"> 188 Spyros Papapetros We advance by placing one foot in front of the other; other creatures, like  the leech, by drawing the body together; others, like the infusoria, slither  along by the aid of cilia; and all of these movements are dependent upon  totally different principles. Yet the ideal aim of attaining what is necessary  for life by a change of place is in all cases the same.11 Everything remains living by changing place. It does not matter  whether the organism uses its feet, as bipeds and quadrupeds do,  or its entire body, as snakes do, or whether it advances quickly, as  hares do, or slowly, as snails do. It does not even matter whether the  organism is in fact an automated mechanism whose movement is  without consciousness. The anima is a mobile energy that is inde- pendent from the bodies it infuses. Ethnographers such as Wilhelm  Wundt, Émile Durkheim, and Marcel Mauss in fact describe the  belief in such a mobile force as the intrinsic principle of the prea- nimistic stage, or animatism, also mentioned by Sigmund Freud in  his Totem and Taboo.12 The word “animatism” refers to the animation  of all objects by a universal force; it is, however, a diffused state of  force equally spread into all objects, preceding the individual souls.  While present in early societies, this distinction is significant for  our contemporary understanding of animation. If there is indeed  a survival of animistic beliefs in technologically advanced civiliza- tions, it is not animism, the belief in individual souls, that persists,  but rather the abstract condition of animatism—the belief in a  common force located outside of individual bodies that is capable  of animating everything.13 Doubting the existence of individual “souls, spirits and will,”  Lucien Lévy-Bruhl would substitute animism with the term “dyna- mism.” Dynamis, the Greek word for “power,” is the unknown god.  “Tribes who know nothing of God or spirit apply a term to every- thing they perceive as a hidden force.”14 The diachronic persever- ance of dynamism indicates that objects are revered not for their  content, but instead for their role as vessels or containers of energy.  Animate and inanimate bodies are electrified by a collective sub- stance that does not exclusively belong to them. However, if in the  societies described by Tylor and Lévy-Bruhl such objects shine with  the energy they would consume and circulate, in the technologi- cally animatist societies described by Comte, Karl Marx, and later  Freud, artifacts gleam with the reserved power that they fetishisti- cally accumulate and refuse to redistribute.15 </page> <page sequence="5"> Movements of the Soul 189 Electric Souls The description of animistic phenomena in terms of electrism is  not by chance. It is significant that the fiber of the bamboo tree,  whose noises made it the animistic plant par excellence, was the  material that Thomas Edison chose for the production of carbon- ized filaments in electric lamps.16 The animated forests of colonial  ethnography were in fact uncannily close to the branching infra- structural networks of the recently electrified Western metropolis.  Indeed, in Primitive Culture Tylor would “venture to assert” that  primitive fetishism reminded him of “the scientific conceptions”  of heat and electricity as “invisible fluids passing in and out of solid  bodies” that were current during his “own schoolboy days.” Amal- gamating mythology with science, the anthropologist would cite  Torricelli, “likening matter to an enchanted vase of Circe.”17 Similar analogies between modern science and primitive magic  dominate James Frazer’s study of animistic mythologies in The  Golden Bough (1890–1900). Outlining his initial principles, Frazer  compares the rules of “sympathetic magic”—in which things act  upon each other by way of an “invisible ether”—to the principles of  modern science, in which “things can physically affect each other  through an empty space.”18 The anthropologist likens the function  of “taboos” to the performance of “electrical insulators,” which  preserve “the spiritual force with which [tabooed] persons are  charged from suffering or inflicting harm by contact with the outer  world.”19 Because the body of the “sacred man” was “an excellent  conductor for the magical fluid,” Frazer describes him as “a Leyden  jar charged with electricity.”20 Thirty years later in Elementary Forms  of the Religious Life (1912), Durkheim would argue that for anyone  who comes into contact with sacred objects “without having taken  proper precautions,” the material properties of religious forces will  manifest themselves by a certain “shock, which might be compared  to the effect of an electrical discharge.”21 The electric output of  objects and subjects becomes a pole not only of electrical attrac- tion but also of magnetic repulsion, which nevertheless enhances  their circumference of radiation and prestige.22 Although centered  upon animal and vegetal substances, this electromagnetic type of  animism is essentially based on the behavior of inorganic matter  analyzed by the natural sciences. Such inorganic animism describes  not only the circulation of energy among human and other natural  bodies, but also the resistance of matter and the friction of forces  that energize all social relations.23 While spreading uniformly among all natural substances, the  anima that sustains this endless circulation of energy, according to  </page> <page sequence="6"> 190 Spyros Papapetros Frazer, is symbolically conferred upon a single object: the body of  the “Divine King.” The randomly selected king acts as a fulcrum  from which all cosmic energy originates and from which it is once  again reflected toward the world: “His person [is] considered the  dynamic center of the universe from which lines of force radiate to  all quarters of the horizon; so that any motion of his—the turning  of the head, the lifting of his hand—instantaneously affects and  may seriously disturb some part of nature.”24 The king is therefore  the figurative embodiment of the abstract forces of animatism. And  yet like every other object, this omnipotent subject is only the con- tainer of a force that gradually eludes and survives him; therefore,  before his body grows weak, he has to be ceremoniously sacrificed. Fooled by Animation Like the disposable body of the Divine King, the electric resusci- tation of animism had a particular life span. The scientific simile  with electrism was not enough to validate Tylor’s anthropological  concept. On the contrary, its resonance with contemporary tech- nological inventions made its existence even more uncanny for  Western scientists of culture. Not long after it was invoked by Tylor,  animism was repudiated by mental evolutionists who refused to  believe that “savages” were naive enough to perceive souls in inani- mate objects.25 Tylor himself had warned that the animism inher- ent in modern and primitive forms of “spiritualism” threatened  to put “two hundred years of Enlightenment” in danger.26 Yet the  anthropologist had all the more “reason to be thankful for fools”— not only primitive “savages” but also modern ghost-seers, Boston  mediums, and members of organized “spiritualist” societies—who  showed “how large a share of stupidity, unpractical conservatism  and dogged superstition” have had in preserving traces of ancient  beliefs, thus serving as “witnesses against themselves” in the pre- cipitous progress of modern science.27 In addition to modern spiritualists, turn-of-the-century anthro- pological literature presents three other categories of victims who  are persistently “fooled” by animation: “savages,” animals, and chil- dren. From Charles Darwin’s observations of the animate reactions  of his dog growling at an open parasol that happened to be swayed  by the wind, to the scientific experiments of his contemporary ani- mal psychologist Tito Vignoli, who waved fabric handkerchiefs and  other inanimate objects in front of horses and other animals to  measure their reactions, scientists concluded that animist behavior  was a pathological symptom that signaled the return of an archaic  </page> <page sequence="7"> Movements of the Soul 191 and instinctual mentality.28 This archaic form of thinking was  still present in “lower stages of humanity” to which fully civilized  humans could only accidentally regress. While animals and “sav- ages” appear more frequently subject to such regressive behavior,  none of them was more privileged and prone to animist deception  than the child. Trying to move beyond the animistic beliefs of tribal and spiri- tualist societies and to illustrate the animistic practices of everyday  life, Tylor would invoke a number of familiar incidents involving  “fully grown Europeans” who in the face of an accident regress  into infantile behavior. For example, after bumping their head  into furniture or a wall, otherwise sensible adults would “instinc- tively” blame the object, curse it, and even hit it back. “The force  of momentary passion will often suffice to supersede the acquired  habit,” Tylor explains, “and even an intelligent man may be  impelled in a moment of agonizing pain to kick or beat the lifeless  object from which he has suffered.”29 Here, pain is the primary  catalyst for the vivification of objects and the reflexive regression  into instinctive behavior. Yet in addition to the physical pain, more  injurious is the mental distress caused by the tactile encounter with  an object that radically undermines the subject’s mastery of her or  his surroundings. As Tylor would remark, children—and especially when irri- tated by pain—are highly susceptible to such “animistic” behavior:  “The first beings that children learn to understand something of  are human beings, and especially their own selves; and the first  explanation of all events will be the human explanation, as though  chairs and sticks and wooden horses were actuated by the same sort  of personal will as nurses and children and kittens.”30 While deni- grating animism as infantile, Tylor inadvertently elevates it into an  innate or instinctive element of human behavior. However, this  tendency for the humanization of objects and the personification  of causes attributed by Tylor to children is entirely different from  the abstract soul of animistic beliefs that his contemporary ethnog- raphers described as neither individual nor personified and with- out personality or will. It is as if the child, according to Tylor, sees  an object as another infant—a lively yet not fully grown human  individual. Animism is once more masked by anthropomorphism,  which was a much more familiar idea for Western audiences. Spencer, Tylor’s contemporary, would disagree. Invoking  another painful interaction between a child and a piece of furni- ture, Spencer would argue that animistic behavior is not innate  but instead is acquired and in fact is taught by certain ill-behaving  adults: </page> <page sequence="8"> 192 Spyros Papapetros But on remembering that trying to pacify a child that has hurt itself  against some inanimate object, a mother or nurse will affect to take the  child’s part against this object, perhaps saying, ‘Naughty chair to hurt  baby—beat it!’ we shall suspect that the notion does not originate with  the child but is given to it.31 What is given to the baby, then, is not only the belief that the object  is animate and responsible for his or her pain, but also the impetus  to reciprocate the injury: “Naughty chair to hurt baby—beat it!”  Mother and child spontaneously unite in lively camaraderie against  the indefensible object. The mother not only humanizes the object  by telling the baby to strike it but also objectifies the baby by can- celing its subjectivity. The alleged humanization of the object pro- vokes the most inhumane behavior in the subject. It is as if the only  way humans and objects can communicate is through reciprocal  punches. That is the gestural language of animation taught by a  subject to another subject and bestowed—only by an accident— upon the object. Forty years after Spencer’s study, the French anthropological  theorist Durkheim would further the English sociologist’s refuta- tion of animism by elaborating on the same accident: If [a child] lays the blame on the table which has hurt him, it is not  because he supposes it animated and intelligent, but because it has hurt  him. His anger once aroused by the pain, must overflow; so it looks for  something upon to discharge itself, and naturally turns toward the thing  which has provoked it, even though this has no effect. The action of an  adult in similar circumstances is often as slightly reasonable. When we are  violently irritated, we feel the need of inveighing, of destroying, though  we attribute no ill will to the objects upon which we vent our anger.32 Durkheim demonstrates that animation does not, as Tylor would  claim, concern the personification of causes. The cause at this  point is irrelevant. What matters is to discharge the effect that has  been caused by any agent, even if such reaction has no impact.  Once again, animation does not concern specific objects, effects,  or directions; rather, as Tylor describes, it is an indiscriminate  furor that unites subjects and objects through a mutual process  of destruction. Like sneezing in primitive beliefs, souls and spirits  pass from one body to another with malevolent effects. Animism  regresses into the preanimistic abstract force of animatism by turn- ing into pure animosity. It is remarkable that in the episode between the baby and table  (or the chair), the object does not move; the subject advances and  </page> <page sequence="9"> Movements of the Soul 193 bumps into it accidentally. And yet the encounter is still described  as if the child was hit by the table. The occurrence of an accident  conflates the idea of causality with the very inability to find a cause.  In many of these cases, the expiation of guilt is habitually transferred  upon the object, which is the most convenient entity to blame. His- torians would describe how in ancient Athens, inanimate artifacts  were put on trial and cast out beyond the city’s border when an  accident happened to their users.33 The eviction of incriminated  tools from the civic territory of ancient Greece echoes the expul- sion of animistic artifacts from the limits of the civilized world in  turn-of-the-century modernity. While revered and overvalued on a  material level, artifacts are criminalized within Western epistemolo- gies; perhaps, then, objects and not subjects are the most unfortu- nate victims of animation. No More Child’s Play Alongside the noisy havoc of destruction and injury, there is also  the prescient calm of fantasy, the illusory mastery enacted by the  infant at play. Referring to the child hit by the table, Durkheim  continues his critique of the infantile recurrence of animism in the  following way: In order that he may consciously play with his jumping-jack, he [the  infant] imagines it a living person. This illusion is the easier for him  because imagination is his sovereign mistress; he thinks almost entirely  with images, and we all know how pliant images are, bending themselves  with docility before every exigency of the will. But he is so little deceived  by his own fiction that he would be the first to be surprised if it suddenly  became a reality, and his toy bit him!34 In other words, the child knows that the jumping-jack is not alive,  but this does not stop the child from treating it as such. “Je sais bien  mais quand meme” (I know well but all the same): like the fetishist  who takes pleasure in an object, which he knows does not have the  properties he ascribes to it, the infant enjoys its animistic exercise  without adhering to an animistic belief.35 Modern animistic behav- ior is a caricature of ancient animism, just as the jumping-jack is  a caricature of anthropomorphic reasoning and personification.  Animism is no longer a doctrine, but instead is a playful per- formance between the subject and an image that serves as the  subject’s double. We gradually move from the area of religious con- victions to the empire of personal fantasies. This is the space of the  </page> <page sequence="10"> 194 Spyros Papapetros unconscious and psychoanalysis, whose discovery by Freud follows  the ethnographers’ own recovery of the soul.36 Like late nineteenth-century anthropology, psychoanalysis ini- tially assigned animism to the dominion of the child yet gradually  reassigned it to more adult stages. In Totem and Taboo (1913), Freud  claimed that among the three “systems of thought” developed  throughout the history of humanity—the animistic (or mythologi- cal), the religious, and the scientific—it is the earliest stage, ani- mism, that “is the most consistent and exhaustive and gives a truly  complete explanation of the nature of the universe.” The reason  for this privilege, the psychoanalyst argued, is that this first world- view “is a psychological theory” that persists to a great degree in  modern life.37 Yet although Freud acknowledged the diachronic  survival of animism, he remained severely critical of its “infantile  recurrences” in modern life, such as the episode of the child’s  assault by and attack on domestic furniture.38 In the third chapter of Totem and Taboo, titled “Animism, Magic  and the Omnipotence of Thought,” the psychoanalyst connects all  three of these phenomena with the narcissistic behavior displayed  by the infant and the neurotic. Animistic and magical beliefs are  the sign of disputed mastery over the overwhelming forces of the  universe and betray the infant’s fundamental vulnerability and  weakness. The subject’s presumed “omnipotence of thoughts”  (“die Allmacht der Gedanken”) is indicative of a state where “[t]hings  become less important than ideas of things” and where material  phenomena dissolve in the pliant shapes of wish fulfillment.39 Echo- ing Durkheim (one of the psychoanalyst’s most reliable sources in  writing Totem and Taboo), Freud claims: If children and primitive men find play and imitative representation  enough for them, that is not a sign of their being unassuming in our  sense or of their resignedly accepting their actual impotence. It is the  easily understandable result of the paramount virtue they ascribe to their  wishes, of the will that is associated with those wishes and the methods by  which these wishes operate.40 Unlike Durkheim, who considered child’s play as irrelevant to the  child’s personal beliefs, Freud discloses how much wishing can in  fact alter the subject’s perception of reality. In Freud’s animism  there is no stable division between belief and fantasy, play and  actuality. However, the deceptive plenitude of wish fulfillment  would in a way presage the sudden shift to the darker side that  Durkheim foresaw in his story about the jumping-jack “biting”  the child the moment it becomes “real.” Animistic phenomena  </page> <page sequence="11"> Movements of the Soul 195 are not only apparitions of what one wants to see but are also— as in the experience of the uncanny—momentary projections of  what one does not want to see and what one fundamentally refuses  to acknowledge. In psychoanalytic terms, one could schemati- cally argue that animation and empathy try to establish a positive  identification between subjects and objects either by means of an  extension, such as the unity of feeling prescribed by empathy (Ein- fühlung), or through a substance common to both, such as the  anima or soul of animation. On the other hand, fetishism and the  uncanny are based on a negative type of identification whereby  the subject fundamentally refuses to identify with an object, how- ever it keeps appearing in front of her (as in the uncanny), or  disavows the original object of her desire through a process of  continuous displacement (fetishism).41 Freud outlines the psycho- logical evolution from the narcissism of animistic wish fulfillment  to the fundamental anxiety of the uncanny in a seminal phrase of  his 1919 essay, in which he addresses the uses of the “double” in  Egyptian portraits of the dead: Such ideas have sprung from the soil of unbounded self-love, from the  primary narcissism which dominates the mind of the child and of primi- tive man. But when this stage has been surmounted, the ‘double’ reverses  its aspect. From having been an assurance of immortality, it becomes the  uncanny harbinger of death.42 It might initially appear surprising that Freud historicizes these  “ideas.” Why does the “double” and other animist conceptions of  the self mean one thing in an earlier stage and another in a more  advanced one? After animistic beliefs cross the line of conscious- ness, they cannot have the same status. Animation is no longer  child’s play. While we never exactly grow out of animist percep- tions, the idea of animation itself grows and reaches adulthood by  surpassing the stage of mere infantile recurrence. In a scientific  world picture, such as the one assigned by Freud to the modern  age, the idea of animation as pure wish fulfillment cannot be sus- tained. There has to be something more, something that corrupts  that idea into its opposite and shows that animistic desires have  shifted from the domain of life to the dominion of inert or inor- ganic matter proclaimed by Freud’s “uncanny harbinger of death.”  In both ethnography and psychoanalysis, then, the very idea of life  in objects has its own history of development or even a soul in and  of itself. The object can be talked to, played with, attacked, or even  beaten, but never again would it be undervalued as the pursuit of  “fools” or mere child’s play. </page> <page sequence="12"> 196 Spyros Papapetros Phobic Animation In spite of changes instituted by psychoanalysis and ethnography  in the status of objects, some things in our own behavior toward  them have not changed. The incident between the child and nurs- ery furniture and other calamitous encounters between persons  and things serve as symptoms of a prevailing mentality in which  we only remember to attribute agency to objects when something  bad is happening to us. Animation appears to happen only as an  accident, a disruptive event that destabilizes normative procedures.  In order for us to acknowledge that objects have a life, they have to  knock us on the head and anesthetize us; when we recover (if we  do), we have to hit them back in return, following the example of  our nineteenth-century predecessors. What we experience in these  spiteful encounters is a form of animation that we could describe  as phobic. The idea of vivification follows the fearful reactions  caused by objects intruding into the territory of the living. Either  expressed in bodily collapse or violently asserted as, for example,  a punch on the table, phobic animation discloses a relationship  that always oscillates between the inexplicable revolt perpetrated  by objects and the dumb role that we insist on assigning to them. This ambivalent attitude is a product of what a host of turn- of-the-century authors describe as the “hostile external world” (die  feindliche Außenwelt).43 However dynamically expressed, phobic ani- mation remains static. It is a process whereby external and internal  painful stimuli replicate each other endlessly but in a limited space.  Such phobic experiences are trapped inside the immobilizing  spaces of the uncanny and are lost among the endless deflections  of the psychoanalytic screens that mediate between projection and  introjection. This belligerent environment is the invention of turn- of-the century psychoanalysis, anthropology, and natural science  yet is also a product of the historical, political, and socioeconomic  conditions of the fin de siècle, which bequeathed that malevolent  milieu to us. Recall how Tylor described animism: “rivers, stones,  trees, weapons and so forth . . . talked to, propitiated, punished for  the harm they do.” Things at the turn of the century were not pri- marily considered for the good they may produce but instead were  considered for the harm they are capable of inflicting. Not only does phobic animation create the idea of the hostile  external world, but these assailing surroundings also generate the  idea of animation—specifically the idea of a soul housed inside  an object. Commenting on the prophylactic function of primitive  animism, Durkheim writes that “in certain critical moments, when  life is supposed to be particularly menaced, it may be desirable  </page> <page sequence="13"> Movements of the Soul 197 to withdraw the soul from the body and lead it to some place or  into some object where it will be in greater security.”44 Here the  object no longer attacks but instead protects; it is a signifier not  of danger but rather of safety. The practice outlined by Durkheim  describes a polarity between a hostile external environment (and  here we could expand this malignant environment from the natu- ral settings described by Durkheim to the urban milieu of turn-of- the-century subjects) and an interior architectural enclosure that  protects the soul. Yet perhaps such distinctions are fundamentally  undermined in modern architecture. It is as if modern subjects  choose to house their imperiled psyches in the very spaces that had  previously assailed them. The fact that several of these animated encounters, such as the  baby’s assault by the table, take place in an interior and that most  of the objects implicated are domestic artifacts, including house- hold furniture, divulges that part of the hostile external world has  already now moved—or has always been—inside; there is no way  of escaping it. The psychological subject of the turn of the century  is essentially trapped between a belligerent external world and an  equally malicious habitat. This is the warped condition of contem- porary space, and in particular modern architecture, that allegedly  is designed to cure yet inadvertently replicates the very principles  of phobic animation.45 Against this phobic reaction, an alternative practice of conta- gious or imitative magic offered a more sympathetic account of ani- mism. It is known from various sources, such as Pliny and Bacon,  and is quoted by Tylor, Frazer, and Freud. According to this custom,  a person who was injured by an object, such as a knife, an arrow, or  a nail that happened to be stuck in his or her foot, would do noth- ing to treat the wound. On the contrary, the person would rub the  injurious article with animal fat, believing that such an act would  heal the cut and alleviate the pain.46 This fastidious treatment of  the object reveals a diametrically different animistic attitude from  the casting away, smashing, or smacking back of allegedly harmful  artifacts that we witnessed in previous examples. Here, the object  is not merely a passive artifact standing in our way but instead is an  active organ. A person cannot hurt a knife back; once the arrow of  pain penetrates the body, it cannot be reversed. There are in fact two ways that we can perceive this primitive  custom as a parable for modern therapeutic practices (after all, a  knife always cuts both ways). The futile endeavor of rubbing the  knife, the arrow, or the nail instead of the wound is an instance  of wishful narcissistic thinking, which leads to the mortal neglect  of the living body in need of treatment. This might be Freud’s  </page> <page sequence="14"> 198 Spyros Papapetros interpretation. In Totem and Taboo, Freud reports that in June  1902 Matilda Henry, a woman from Norwich who treated a nail  that punctured her foot instead of treating the wound died from  sepsis three days after her accident.47 Yet what also becomes evi- dent in this paradoxical treatment is the unique sympathetic bond  that the subject nurtures with an object even though (or precisely  because) it has hurt her. The care and preservation of the acerbic  artifact shows the subject’s tendency to prolong pain inside her  body, even when the harmful agent has been removed. The anoint- ing of the nail reveals an almost architectural tendency to actualize  pain into a monument as a sustaining resolution. The care of and  for the nail shows that if there is a way of dealing with objects, it is  exactly through and not away from the harm they can inflict. This  is a sign of the subject trying to make something out of her or his  attachment to objects instead of continuously disavowing them. By  condemning and casting the harmful artifact away, one can only  beckon it back. It is the denial of the power of things that provokes  the uncanny to return again and again. Extensional Animation The story of the care for the nail suggests that we may ultimately  communicate with an object instead of fearfully retracting or recip- rocating the attack. Phobic animation is not the only possibility  of exchange or affect between a human body and a thing. Could  there be another form of animation in which we could survive the  life of objects without suspending our own? As opposed to the contraction that characterized many fear- ful accounts of modern metropolitan spaces, we could envision  an animated occurrence based on formal extension that is in fact  prevalent in tribal and archaic animistic cultures. Here, the ani- mated form protracts instead of forestalling modes of relationality  between subject and things. Such extensional encounters would  consist of an exchange based on a willing and not coerced reci- procity between different species of animate and inorganic life.  Unlike the immobilizing effect of the uncanny and of fetishism,  this extensional form of animation facilitates an uninterrupted  flow, a continuous use without possession. The anima becomes  a borrowed substance, a gift that no one possesses and that con- tinuously returns to its original source for others to use. Unlike  the extension provided by modern media technologies that rein- state the power of the prosthetic body, the extensional animation  described here strips the subject from its autocratic power and  </page> <page sequence="15"> Movements of the Soul 199 turns it into a plastic container of the migrating animating agency  or soul. In his incomplete essay on Disney, Sergei Eisenstein traces a  similar form of communication between subjects and objects medi- ated by cartoons. By combining a detailed description of Disney’s  animated films with a close reading of Tylor’s ethnographic descrip- tions of animistic practices, the Russian cinematographer rein- vented cartoon animation as the reanimation of archaic beliefs on  an infinitely extensible form of the soul.48 To be sure, for Eisenstein  the popularity of cartoons was concomitant with the fear of the  “grey wolf of unemployment” that terrorized the United States in  the early 1930s.49 But beyond the contraction of phobic animation,  for Eisenstein cartoons represent the virtual extensibility of the  “protoplasmic being,” the protean origin of earthly life whose ves- tiges survived in the memory of all organisms. Such ambient forms  of extensibility is reflected in the “plasticity of fire,” the unnatural  “elongation of necks” in Alice in Wonderland, or the “stretching of  hands” in Japanese and Western vignettes.50 In all of these instances  of “formal ecstasy,”51 human limbs extend into territories and  degrees of matter that do not normatively belong to them.52 In the animated exchanges described by Eisenstein, the cessa- tion of causality is experienced as liberating. The enigmatic char- acter of the object, the core we will never touch, the language we  can never speak, all become a source of alternative perception. In  order for man to survive, the subject has to be stripped of its pow- ers; it has to drop down in stages of life and become inorganic,  plant, animal, mineral, or a mere shape. One can already sense (and partly sympathize with) the skep- ticism of critics who consider such plastic forms of animation no  different than any meta-Hegelian pantheistic fantasy and who  argue that such ideational mirages essentially ignore the menacing  historical reality that these virtual communications allegedly tran- scend. In their confrontation with real life, even the extensibility of  forms found in cartoons is radically curtailed: Cartoons were once exponents of fantasy as opposed to rationalism. They  ensured that justice was done to the creatures and objects they electrified,  by giving the maimed specimens a second life. All they do today is to  confirm the victory of technological reason over truth.53 Like Eisenstein, Adorno and Horkheimer here disclose that the pri- mary impulse behind animation is the necessity of “a second life”  for objects and natural specimens that never had a real life: ani- mation is about the revivification of all the unfulfilled possibilities  </page> <page sequence="16"> 200 Spyros Papapetros represented by plants, minerals, and lower animals that secretly  coexist within the human. But what once looked like the animating  possibility of “a second life” is now the petrified relic of an afterlife.  The elongated shapes and material crossbreeding of Eisenstein’s  “formal ecstasy” appear as the amoebic waste product of the grid of  capitalist reason.54 Cartoons themselves are inanimated. However, even the critics of modern animated culture acknowl- edge the extensible properties of objects and their animated  representations. Although centered on fetishism’s individual  objects—and not totemism’s families of objects—Marx’s critique  of commodities substantiates the way that commercial artifacts in  Western societies are the locus of misplaced social relations.55 Like  Frazer’s “electrical insulators,” commodified objects paradoxically  attract through their power of repulsion.56 Things become unap- proachable because of the energy of sociation they are supposed  to distribute but end up never sharing. In his Philosophy of Money,  Georg Simmel portrays capital as an abstract animated form: “an  extremely liquid body which takes on any form, and does not shape  itself but receives any form it may possess only from the surround- ing body.”57 This is why money is the most anxiously “mobile of all  goods”: it is never individualized or fully occupied by separate sub- jects or objects.58 Like the anima and Eisenstein’s cartoon, money  is a “protoplasmic being,” an energy diffused upon a multitude of  things. For that reason, “fetishism” and “animism” are not the most  accurate terms for describing the form of religion espoused by  modern economy; more appropriate is the term “animatism,” Lévy- Bruhl’s theoretical preanimistic system centered upon an abstract  impersonal force. The parallels between the histories of animism and turn-of-the- century economic or sociological theories are not fortuitous. Both  phobic and extensional forms of animation are based on a con- crete reality, however mythic the latter might seem. While predom- inantly considered a private fantasy, animation has an established  social origin. Ethnographic research has unearthed this lost origin,  revealing that what today is viewed as an ephemeral or personal  illusion is the vestige of a diachronic and communal myth. The Lost Soul While pronouncing the death of earlier anthropological theories  of animism, Durkheim, in the conclusion of his Elementary Forms of  the Religious Life, proposes a way that the idea of the anima could  continue living. What inspired the idea of the immortality of the  </page> <page sequence="17"> Movements of the Soul 201 soul was not the belief in an individual psyche that would hover in  some faraway ethereal region after death but instead “the perpetu- ity of the life of the group” right here on Earth. The anima was  an immaterial bond, a “germinative plasm” representing a type of  “spiritual unity” that connects the members of the social organism  in the course of life and death. “Individuals die, but the clan sur- vives. So the forces which give it life must have the same perpetuity.  Now these forces are the souls which animate individual bodies;  for it is in them and through them that the group is realized.”59  Human bodies act as material heuristics, while the anima is the per- manent factor in the social equation. Durkheim applies the same  sociological scheme to totemic systems in which the impact of the  soul expands from human bodies to things: No one possesses it entirely and all participate in it. It is so completely  independent of the particular subjects in whom it incarnates itself, that it  precedes them and survives them. Individuals die, generations pass and  are replaced by others; but this force always remains actual, living and  the same. It animates the generations of today as it animated those of  yesterday and as it will animate those of tomorrow. Taking the words in a  large sense, we may say that it is the god adored in each totemic cult. Yet  it is an impersonal god, without name or history, immanent in the world  and diffused in an innumerable multitude of things.60 The indefinable entity described by Durkheim is the secret nucleus  behind every form of animation. Not only the life of the tribe but  also the survival of animation as a collective practice depends upon  this impersonal soul. Animation is in the core of every social move- ment. The desire for a collective point of reference unites bodies  and things in perpetual circulation. Even if seemingly aberrant, the  soul’s perpetual movement is driven by an ultimate aim. The tran- sient object that houses that soul can be anything: a twig, a bird  feather, a live animal, a man-made artifact, or a building structure.  The subject temporarily grants power to the object as an active gift.  Properties, qualities, memories, and social relations are all incor- porated in this object, whose circumference of energy far exceeds  its actual dimensions. This form of collective movement centered  upon objects is certainly not absent in modern cultures, but is dis- placed and stalled in a static yet extremely potent form of vibration.  The static animation of commodities in modern capitalist societies  is only one example of the power as well as the displacement of this  archaic force. Taking account of the differences between archaic and mod- ern animistic practices, we can elucidate the distinctions between  </page> <page sequence="18"> 202 Spyros Papapetros Durkheim’s model of social animation and its fossilized remnants  in capitalist modernity. While Durkheim’s collective soul was sup- posed to unite the members of a social group, the spirited econ- omy of capital separates them. Not all members have equal access  to the animating force, leading to a substantial difference in the  mode of social organization. Durkheim’s principles were based on  the organic theories of Saint-Simon and his followers, for whom  the social organism was a unified bodily entity of external limbs  and internal organs activated by the same animating force.61 Yet  during the transformation of this animated organism from nine- teenth-century to twentieth-century discourses, the overall compo- sure of organization shifted from an organic to an inorganic—or  even a superorganic—model. Modern plateaus are animated by  the social friction they produce and the reaction force they gener- ate. There are no more individual organs or external limbs; there is  only a “body without organs” that has multiple animating centers,  resembling a fabric that is uniformly animated in and by all of its  individual threads.62 What we recognize today as animation is instead the reanima- tion of the memory of Durkheim’s lost collective soul. While dis- tributed in a multitude of spaces and scattered in a mass of artifacts,  the contemporary animistic object fails to fulfill its social promise.63  As ethnographers recount, when the divine fetish did not produce  the goods it had promised, the previously reverent faithful would  revolt and start beating and abusing the object of their earlier exal- tation as punishment for its alleged deceit. Unlike the altercation  between the child and the furniture, here the object is punched  back not for the injury it unexpectedly triggered, but instead for  the anticipated benefit it fell short of producing. The spirit of the  depreciated object would wander belligerently in the air as a side  product of the energy that was “wasted” in it.64 In a similar way,  commodified artifacts fail to fulfill the promise of communication  that they advertize on their surface. When their conceit wears out  they will inevitably provoke the contempt and aggression of their  former users and in turn appear demonic or malicious, thereby  perpetuating the hostility of the external world. “Animism spiritualized the object, whereas industrialism  objectifies the spirits of men,” claim Horkheimer and Adorno, the  two dialecticians of Enlightenment. Commodity fetishism has an  “arthritic influence over all aspects of social life,” which gradually  transmogrifies individuals into things.65 The symptoms of “arthri- tis” diagnosed by the two authors disclose that the bodily effect trig- gered by the overstimulating environments of modern life is not  an instant form of paralysis; on the contrary, it is an imperceptibly  </page> <page sequence="19"> Movements of the Soul 203 slow process of calcification that takes hold of the body, gradually  mineralizing its substance and arresting its mobile soul. We have  moved from the dynamic animation of the 1900s to the stultifying  anesthesia of Fantasia 2000 (1999).
