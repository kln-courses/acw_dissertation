<plain_text><page sequence="1">434 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 24:2 (2OI2) The OratorlO Le Tulafale. Feature film, no minutes, color, 2011. Written and directed by Tusi Tamasese; produced by Catherine Fitzgerald; distributed by Transmis sion Films Ltd (in Australasia) and the New Zealand Film Commission (global). Samoan with English sub titles. Release information available at http://theoratorfilm.co.nz/ The Orator/O Le Tulafale hit our creative capital city of Wellington like the tropical thunderstorm that majestically opens the film—potent, uncompromising, life-affirming. After being drenched by it, the world appeared refreshed. As educators and students in Va'aomanu Pasifika offering programs in Samoan studies and Pacific studies at Victoria Uni versity, we witnessed the excitement that writer/director Tusi Tamasese's feature-length debut generated among our colleagues and in our classrooms, communities, and homes. We began to swap stories about "Orator effects." The movie prompted quiet students to speak, brought staunch old chiefs to tears, and facilitated the types of conversations that we need to have in the Pacific but often do not voice. As the film's blessings continued to pour down on us, we sought ways to chan nel the runoff. First, some of our staff organized a roundtable discussion, giving undergraduate and graduate students and staff an opportunity to engage in passionate dialogue about the film in both English and Samoan. It was in that forum that the following reviews began to germinate, each the product of a collaboration between a senior and junior scholar in Pacific studies or Samoan studies. Staff also had the opportunity to share their thoughts for a Radio New Zealand International piece on The Orator, coordinated by an undergraduate student in Pacific studies and intended to air in conjunction with the publica tion of this issue of The Contemporary Pacific. Collectively, the following reviews present an opportunity for members of our intellectual commu nity to harvest the budding fruits of well-watered intellectual plantations and offer them back to those we serve. It is both a privilege and an obligation to honor this film in the best way we know how—through loving, critical commentary. APRIL K HENDERSON Victoria University of Wellington The OratorlO Le Tulafale has been touted as the first full-length feature film to be written and directed by a Samoan and filmed in Samoa and in the Samoan language. Given that the screenwriter and director, Tusi Tamasese, is a University of Waikato film school graduate and earned a master's in screenwriting from the Vic toria University of Wellington (vuw), and that the film was largely funded by the New Zealand Film Commis sion, produced by a New Zealander, and features some of New Zealand's most respected visual and sound technicians, The Orator is also being enthusiastically claimed as a New Zealand film. For a directorial debut, it is remarkable that the film has received critical acclaim at the Venice Film Festival in 2011, is scheduled for the 2012 Sundance Festival, and was nominated by New Zealand for</page><page sequence="2">BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEWS 435 an Academy Award in the category of foreign language films. The central characters of The Ora tor are a farmer and a weaver. Sa'ili and his wife Va'aiga each have painful histories of being excluded or dimin ished by others—Sa'ili for being not only an untitled adult male in a village and society that privileges chiefs, but a little person to boot, and Va'aiga for shaming her family by having a child out of wedlock. Sa'ili has raised Va'aiga's teenage daughter Litia as his own, although Litia is ambivalent about having him as a father. The film centers on Sa'ili and Va'aiga's struggles to confront their own fears and demons—Sa'ili through acquir ing a talking chief title, and Va'aiga by weaving a fine mat ('ie toga) of atonement. Their quests are set amid scenes of majestic mountain ridges, lush taro plantations, tranquil bathing pools, and meticulously manicured rural villages. Ironically, given that the film title might lead one to expect an abundance of verbiage (a tulafale is a talking chief), one of the distinguish ing features of the film is its economy of dialogue. The silence simultane ously tills and weaves the possibilities for multiple layers of understanding through the film. Like Sa'ili the farmer and Va'aiga the weaver, The Orator is able to present gifts to those who would receive them. Through this review, we attempt, as non-Samoan Pacific Islanders—Micronesians—to reciprocate. We both saw the film, for the first time, in the early days of its screening in Wellington, New Zealand, in Octo ber 2011. Our review features our individual "takes" on the film, with Emelihter responding to The Orator's representations of place and culture, and Teresia approaching the film as a teacher in Pacific studies. As creative writers and active participants in arts communities across the region, both of us have a keen sense of a shared genealogy when it comes to an "Oce anic imaginary" (Subramani, "The Oceanic Imaginary," 2001). We close our review with reflections on what it means now to have The Orator situ ated in that genealogy. Reaction shot (Emelihter): "I wanted Samoa to be a character in the film," said Tusi Tamasese dur ing a cast and crew q&amp;a held at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa) in Wellington on 29 October 2011. This character is the one we see first: Samoa—fecund, quiet, dark, and thirsty. Audiences are made to listen to the whisper that comes just before the downpour, and it was then that I knew this was going to be an honest Pacific (Samoan) film. Already, I wanted to cry, and very few movies make me cry. Because I'm from Pohnpei in Micronesia, an island with rainfall of more than 300 inches a year, rain is a central part of my Pohn peian/Pacific understanding. Rain on a tin roof represents home to those of us who grew up in homes like these and to those of us who romanticize about such dwellings. It is this feel ing of the familiar—of "belonging," in a Sia Figiel sense (Where We Once Belonged, 1996)—that makes so many of us fall in love with Tusi Tamasese's film. This communal, shared feeling is central to the film in a way that makes many of us who live away, Samoans and other Pacific persons, long for the home(s) we left behind. This is not to say that Samoans watching the film in</page><page sequence="3">436 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 24:2 (2012) Samoa won't feel similarly potent con nections to place. But Pacific Islanders living in diaspora will be watching the film through a lens tinted with nostal gia. However, this is no sentimental, romanticized Pacific Island feature film—thank you, Mr Tamasese. The unspoken, delivered through Samoa's landscape and characters going about their daily routines, is one of the strongest elements of The Orator. The story unfolds with a subtlety like Va'aiga's 'ie toga, a piece of her that remains with her family when her body is taken home by Sa'ili and Litia. Tamasese and cinematographer Leon Narbey are masters at transferring the island pace to screen. The slow and wide shots ever so realistically convey the stifling humidity as well as the small moments that only a Samoan from Samoa would know how to transfer to screen with the help of a very talented crew. There are many of these little moments: the "Telesia" segment on the radio, Sa'ili napping on his parents' graves, and the young women of the village watching the men play rugby (we know what they are thinking). At times the film envelops its viewers in a hopelessness that suffocates, a powerful sadness surrounded by beautiful foliage and people, some of them malicious and power hungry and some of them humble and strong. The film is highly sensual without any sex and leaves the senses intoxicated. Above all, The Orator left me envious of Samoans for having this precious film to call their own; grateful to Tamasese, cast, and crew; and inspired to create beauty. Kalahngan en kupivur karohsie me iang wiahda kasdo kesempwal wet. Reaction shot (Teresia): In my Samoan Irish New Zealander hus band's most Polynesian nationalist moments he will remind me that all I-Kiribati were originally Samoans. I don't mind because there's good linguistic evidence of that and because unlike most of his kin, at least my husband knows that Samoans have significant historical connections to other less well-known cultural groups in the Pacific. If I'm alert, I'll retort that my I-Kiribati ancestors left Samoa for good reason. Samoans can be pretty ethnocentric and will fully ignorant about the rest of the Pacific. Many believe that they are the "sacred center" and that we are meant to revolve around them. Some of us other Pacific people resent that. In New Zealand, you get a lot of grum bling in community events, consulta tion events, and even in some of our Pacific studies classes, about Samoan domination. But sometimes Samoan pride hits the right note, and we can all celebrate it along with them. Our vuw Pacific studies students' reception of The Orator is one such example of Samoan pride hitting the right note. In several class sessions and in a roundtable discussion organized by our program about the film on 20 October 2011, student after student of Samoan descent declared how proud the film made them to be Samoan. But what made these declarations most meaningful was that they were invari ably accompanied by the students' questions about choices made by the writer/director and by their critical reflections about issues of representa tion in the film. This is the kind of Samoan pride I feel like I as a non Samoan can get behind because this is not the kind of pride that people</page><page sequence="4">BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEWS 437 from Fiji, where I grew up, might call viavia levu (arrogance). As an outsider, what I see and hear in my Samoan students' and colleagues' and friends' responses to this film can best be described in one Samoan word: alofa. This is The Orator's gift to Pacific studies, an ethos so clearly visible— and audible—in the choice of shots, in the sound design, in the structure of the plot, in the construction of the characters, and in the delicate bal ance between representing both the beautiful and the ugly sides of Samoa and Samoans. It is alofa—a pure and confident love, empowered rather than disempowered, to narrate and create, to interrogate, criticize, and comfort—that infuses this film. Like Albert Wendt and Sia Figiel before him, Tamasese has taken representa tions of Samoa far beyond the vulgar objectifications of the Mead/Freeman controversy and, most importantly, has done it with the alofa/aroha/aloha/ loloma/tangira/limpoak that Wendt deemed imperative for Pacific people's sovereignty over our own intellectual pursuits ("Towards a New Oceania," 1976). So if alofa is The Orator's gift to Pacific studies, what is its gift to non-Samoans more generally? It takes a huge effort not to feel a pang of envy as a non-Samoan watching this film. But if you, like me, still feel frustrated at not having the means at your disposal to outdo the Samoans just yet, you know what they say: if you can't beat them, make love with them. Alofa atu. (Joint commentary resumed) In their 1999 essay "Four Writers and One Critic" (in Inside Out: Literature, Cultural Politics, and Identity in the New Pacific), Vilsoni Flereniko and Sig Schwarz proposed that literary critics in the Pacific should think of themselves as "talking chiefs" for the region's writers and literatures. While there are some problems with the applicability of such a model across other Pacific and especially non Polynesian texts and contexts, their idea raises interesting implications for engaging with a text such as The Orator. As we see in the film, among the key duties of a tulafale in Samoa is to find out the statuses and lineages of the people he or she is among and about to address. We close this review ever conscious of our not being Samoan, and especially conscious of the limitations the film sets up for women as orators. We want to take up the challenge of thinking through a talking chief's privileges and respon sibilities—not so much as literary or film critics, but as creative writers and performers ourselves—and we wonder, does the the Pacific need more talking chiefs? At the cast and crew q&amp;a at Te Papa we referred to earlier, Tamasese admitted he had not seen Martyn Sanderson's 1990 film adaptation of Albert Wendt's 1994 novella Flying Fox in a Freedom Tree until after he had written his film script. Moreover, he was not aware until then that his little person Sa'ili had a predecessor in Albert Wendt's "Tagata," the main character in Flying Fox. Perhaps this was an oversight that only another Samoan could afford. The two of us are used to sometimes having a greater awareness of Samoans' contemporary creative genealogies than many of the Samoans we interact with, which can be a bit embarrassing for both par ties. In Tamasese's case, perhaps not</page><page sequence="5">438 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • Z4'.Z (zoiz) being burdened by the knowledge of what had gone before is what set free his genius. But as Micronesian women writers from the un(der)-represented Pacific Islands of Pohnpei, Banaba, and Kiribati, we have never felt that we could afford such ignorance. We understand that to enter into creative cultural production in the Pacific is to become part of a gene alogy of thought and imagination, whether you are aware of it or not. Both of us have actively sought out Pacific films, poetry, and music for inspiration, affirmation, and pure necessity (artistic survival!). It has not always been easy searching for ways to identify with work by fellow Pacific Islander artists who often have little awareness of who we are or where we are from, but this predicament has given us a deep appreciation for how precious and valuable each creative contribution to the Pacific is. The Orator richly deserves celebration, and it is our creative duty as Pacific artists/scholars/students to articulate our alofa for it. But just as impor tantly, we need to be able to locate it within a genealogy of other Pacific films by Pacific writers and directors such as Vilsoni Hereniko's The Land Has Eyes/Pear ta ma 'on maf (2004) and Toa Fraser's No. z/Naming num ber two (zoo6). Each of these films addresses issues of both alienation and aspiration, explores the intersec tion of customary practices and social change, and in some ways can be perceived as love letters by each of the writer/directors to their ancestral homelands. It is also worth recalling that The Land Has Eyes preceded The Orator as an indigenous language film shot on the home island by an indig enous writer and director. Space does not allow us further commentary on how these three Pacific Islands fea ture films might be read productively together, but we hope that others will take up that challenge since each in its moment has expanded our collec tive Oceanic imaginary. The Orator's unique offering to the two of us as creative practitioners is a renewed sense of dedication to and pride in the craft of creating (in) the contemporary Pacific. EMELIHTER KIHLENG AND TERESIA K TEAIWA Victoria University of Wellington Samoan director Tusi Tamasese's debut feature The Orator/O Le Tula fale simultaneously comforts and chal lenges its Samoan audience—it takes us on a provocative, nonjudgmental excursion into the icons, nuances, and metaphors of Samoa's history and society and into Samoan ways of feel ing and thinking. As Samoans engaged in the development of Samoan and Pacific studies, we are thrilled by the opportunity that this film offers to explore the nuances of contemporary Samoan life without losing sight of the profound significance of particu lar cultures for addressing universal human concerns. The Orator appears to be a muse working to awaken and tease Samoan and Pacific imaginations, inspiring us to move beyond banal, superficial, and dogmatic interpretations in order to get "beneath the surface," as Tusi observed in a zoii interview with Stephen Carnell (http://www .theprimateperspective.com/). As its</page><page sequence="6">BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEWS 439 nuances and meanings surface, come alive, and dance, enticing viewers to delve deeper, the story encourages Samoans to make sense for them selves of what fa'asamoa (Samoan culture) might or ought to be and how it resonates with other cultures. As muse, the film titillates our intellectual capacities and awakens those parts of our Samoan or Pacific selves that may have been deadened by the over whelming impossibilities and tensions of contemporary monoliths—monolin gualism, monoculturalism, monothe ism, and even monogamy. Its sumptu ous smorgasbord of visuals, sounds, and linguistic metaphors provides windows through which to study the rhetoric, practice, vulnerabilities, and strengths of what it might mean to be Samoan, to be "of Samoa," or to be of the increasingly global Pacific. The Orator might also be provocateur, subversively seeking our express and complicit acknowl edgment (as Samoans) that there is sophisticated beauty in a chiefly culture that promotes simplicity and restraint. Described by the director as his "hero" in one online interview (blog.flicks.co.nz, 4 Oct 2011), the Samoan chief Leopa'o is someone bestowed with voice and power— raised to speak less and listen more, to speak only when he must and, when he must, to speak in a manner that is loving and aims always for peace. Rhetoric and metaphor are core tools in the oratorical repertoire of Samoan chiefs because of the assumption that their allusive qualities help to avoid confrontation—provided, of course, that those interpreting the allusive speech understand its cultural logic. As provocateur, the film forces us to admit that at times we Samoans can be an inflexibly proud people, overly strict and emotionally undemonstra tive. It forces us to recognize that we too grapple with issues of violence— structural and personal, blatant and subtle, and often gendered. In Samoa's hierarchical and patriarchal society, there is high potential for the negative exploitation of neighbors and fam ily members, often realized, as the film suggests, in the normalization of domestic violence. The film is satu rated with scenes in which the poten tial for violence seems ever-present, either in speech or by gesture—from the use of words such as 'aikae (eat shit) and pogaua (translated as "pain in the neck") as threats or in jest, to the use of threatening stances while holding a machete or rocks. At the structural level, a masculine chauvinis tic violence in particular is implicit, for example, in the retributive treatments imposed on Litia, one of the film's heroines, compared with that imposed on her married male lover. Viewers may also not realize the subtle but significant and gender-specific link in the film between the pe'a as symbol of Samoan male courage and the Samoan saying, "E i ai sou ake?" ("Do you have any balls?). But perhaps the film's most sub versively persuasive force is its simple message about alofa. As embraced in The Orator, alofa forgives our transgressions—what Tui Atua, in the 2011 Professor James Ritchie Memo rial Lecture Series keynote address, described as tua'oi or boundaries; it mediates our differences, pursues jus tice, and finds us peace. It overcomes or resolves hurts, rejuvenates joys, and re-imagines personal and collec</page><page sequence="7">440 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 24:2 (2012) tive futures. It has been said by many a Samoan orator that fa'asamoa is founded on alofa. Tusi's Orator basi cally says the same thing, but what a powerfully layered and evocative way to say it! As Tusi astutely portrays, Samo ans have a love of rhetoric, history, family, and place. Similarly, Samoans are fascinated by the play between the physical and metaphysical, the sacred and profane, the bidden and forbid den. Much of this love is said in the unsaid—in a look, a gesture, a touch, a flinch, a stance, a smile, a half-smile, even in a preference for a plant or for a particular style of dress. It is also captured in the names chosen and in the linguistic expressions and idioms used. To adequately convey all this, Tusi's Samoan story about his Samoan orator had to be told in the Samoan language and in Samoa. Thank fully this necessity was recognized and supported by the New Zealand Film Commission and the Samoan Government. To understand how The Orator is metaphor personified, it is useful to unpack what we believe is the legacy of Leopa'o. This chiefly title bestowed on the lead character, Sa'ili, liter ally means "voice (leo) with a bang (pa'o)." The image conjured up is of someone with a "strong voice," a voice with impact. Samoan historians have pointed out that Samoan history was recorded using names, especially the names of people and places, and that Samoan leaders reveled in double speak, riddles, and metaphors. Tusi implies putting this methodology to work in his use of the names "Sa'ili" and "Tagaloa." Both are loaded with suggestive meanings. The obvious interpretation for the name "Sa'ili" is its everyday meaning, "to search." In the context of the film we are led to surmise that it is a search for power, voice, and presence—for Sa'ili, the presence of mind and of body to say what is in his heart. Add to this the fact that Tusi chose to name Sa'ili's high chief "Tagaloa," and we are led to surmise further that perhaps Tusi is deliberately poking at Samoa's continued but repressed belief in its anthropomorphic God Tagaloaalagi, the name sometimes abbreviated as Tagaloa, believed to be the found ing ancestor of Samoa and Samoans. Here Tusi implies that the legacy of Leopa'o is his love not only for his wife and family but also for his Samoa, a Samoa that embraces its ancient mythologies, with all its warts and faults. By having Tagaloa bestow the title Leopa'o on Sa'ili, Samoan indigenous theology meets—at least in name—Samoan contemporary life. Va'aiga, the name given to Sa'ili's wife, is equally interesting. As a name, it embodies three words of significance to Samoa: va (the relational space that Albert Wendt and many others write about); 'aiga (the Samoan family unit, core to Samoan culture, economics, and politics); and va'ai (to see, to seek, to look after—similar in meaning to the word sa'ili). The names carry the metaphorical message that Sa'ili and Va'aiga are both looking and search ing. To give this name to the mother of a family is also to draw on the significance afforded to women in fa'asamoa as tama'ita'i (female heirs and carriers of family inheritances); as feagaiga (protectors of family peace); and as ilamutu (female mystics). Each</page><page sequence="8">BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEWS 441 of these roles and statuses is present in the film: when Va'aiga's brother Poto seeks her forgiveness, her roles as feagaiga and ilamutu are hinted at; when her body is brought back to the place of her birth, her status as tama'ita'i is acknowledged. The importance of environment and spirituality in this film cannot be overstated. For instance, the influence of Christianity in Samoa is present in the shot of stained-glass church crucifix windows shown during the scene set in the village sa period (the mandatory evening prayer time); it is there in the blurring of Tagaloa's pe'a; and it is most powerfully there in the scene in which a young boy perched Zaccheus-like atop a pua (plumeria) tree witnesses redemption/ retribution coming to Litia. The words of the young lad's song—"Faigata o lenei olaga 'ua o'o mai, na'o Iesu na fetalai, na'o ia 'e te malolo ai" (Woe the burdens of this life, only through Jesus can we find relief)—provide subtle but clear evidence of Chris tianity's hold on the Samoan spirit. Similarly, there is scarcely a moment in the film that does not underline the significance of the natural world to Samoan life: the taro and ta'amu (elephant ear taro), whose leaves and roots are staple foods for Samoans; the nonu (Indian mulberry) plant, known for its healing properties; the image of the languid snail, indicative of the pace of Samoan village life; the native 'iao bird (wattled honeyeater) singing in the morning; the dogs bark ing; people bathing in natural springs; women weaving mats of dried pan danus leaves; the sounds of children playing and the tropical rain falling in abundance; and the burial of deceased family members on the front lawns of family houses. The Orator's achievement as a resource for honest reflection on Samoan life and the human condi tion is realized by the tremendous talent and generosity of those who came together to make this film. We are indebted to Tusi Tamasese and his collaborators for showing us how we can tell a rich, honest, and loving story about ourselves and our Samoan heritage. This, to us, is the legacy of Leopa'o, and we celebrate with him by calling his 'ava (kava cup): "Ooooo lau 'ava lenei Sa'ilimalo!"

People of Samoan, Maori, other Pacific, and European back grounds were making their way into the theater to watch this new Samoan film—uncertain of what to expect, like fishermen guessing what might be at the end of their lines. From the opening scenes of the movie, however, a swell of inspiration, excitement, and pride could be felt throughout the theater. The film's introduction of Samoa portrays a sumptuous, rich, and fertile environment. The beauty of the land scape astonishes—deep green moun tains appear, accompanied by light, gentle raindrops falling on luscious green taro leaves, the popping and echoing sound of rain hitting other leaves in the forest, the excited songs of the rain-forest birds; a lizard near a sun-dried branch quietly and slowly meanders along dry brown leaves to look for its day's rations. It is also an introduction to the superb use of visual language that enriches the film throughout, exemplifying how power ful and resonant the medium of film can be. And then this visual feast and the peaceful audio of the deep forest is shattered by profane language. The curses uttered by workers in the taro patch foreshadow the complexity of the world being conveyed. Given the film's title, it is not sur prising that The Orator pays exquisite attention to the multidimensional role of language and its varieties in daily life. The characters' nuances and dif ferences are reflected in the lines they deliver—the language of happiness, sadness, words to curse by as well as to reflect anger, and forms of respect and ceremonial language. The lan guage used in the plantation reflects that part of Samoan life where we curse a neighbor we don't like. But in the movie, as often in real life, this is usually hidden away and is rarely intended to be heard; this is why, in the film, it is used in the bush and not in the village center. When heard outside of the house, such language indicates that families are at logger heads—in this case the film's viewers are placed in a remarkable position where they view both the internal and external dynamics of intimate relation ships. The multifaceted use of language is one method by which the writer/ director Tusi Tamasese captures the way the people live their lives. The use of the Samoan language in the film is a particularly important milestone and provides special satisfaction for Samoan audiences. Their excitement and joy was palpable in the Porirua screening, as an intriguing experience of the Samoan culture could be seen</page><page sequence="12">BOOK AND MEDIA REVIEWS 445 and heard through the appropriate use of that culture's own language. Many Samoan speakers may balk at the vile language used in parts of the film, but many others may have no problem with it, since such talk is part of what the real world of people like us Samoans is about. The bad needs to be seen and heard just like the good that makes up that world. This is part of a professional compass that com pels Tamasese to follow the ethics and principles of his art. What is the essential intention of this film? Though there appear to be a number of these, we suggest that the film has a central goal. The Ora tor is the first major feature film in the Samoan language to be shown in international cinemas. This places the film squarely on a pioneering plat form. The story line is centered on the lives of a Samoan couple who live in the village of the husband's family. Sa'ili is no ordinary husband, for he is a dwarf, and Va'aiga, his wife, is an outcast, banished by her family and village for giving birth to a fatherless child. Like any other couple, they have learned to live within and in spite of their personal circumstances, and they must complement their differences. The fact that Sa'ili is a dwarf does not discourage Va'aiga; in fact, she uses it to challenge him to be strong. One evening as dusk sets in, while Va'aiga is bathing in the village pool, she answers Sa'ili's question regarding what it takes to be a chief: "God gave you a mouth and a heart! That's all you need to be chief!" Va'aiga's admonition means that it matters for an orator to have guts. It does not matter whether one is a dwarf, nor does it matter if one does not have social standing—to be an orator one must be bold and coura geous and not be afraid to speak. As the Samoa Times recorded (28 Nov 2011), "The climax ... of this film was planned from the beginning, and it was certain that the audience would wait to see if Sa'ili could speak as an orator." When Va'aiga dies and her body is snatched away by her brother and taken back to her family and village, a major wall of uncertainty is placed in front of Sa'ili, which he has to overcome. He must persuade her family to return her body so she can be buried on his land. In its premier screening, tears rolled down our faces as we watched Sa'ili stand and orate in front of Va'iga's family. This film's outstanding achieve ments deserve comment. Not only has The Orator received favorable reviews and top recognition at the Venice International Film Festival, but it was also selected as New Zealand's entry in the prestigious Academy Awards, in the foreign language category. The skillful craftsmanship of film maker Tusi Tamasese is reminiscent of the heroic efforts and the competi tiveness of the legendary Leatiogie, whose blind father Fe'epo applauded while resting in his abode. However, while Leatiogie's skills were displayed in heroic war games, the comparable intelligence, expertise, and diligence of Tusi shine through the art of film making—it is a testament to his God given gifts and talents. Crafting a film is like fishing in the deep ocean where outcomes are unpredictable since the fisher may encounter dangerous fish and numer ous other obstacles and challenges. Nevertheless, Samoa and the whole</page><page sequence="13">446 THE CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC • 24:2 (2012) world salute the production of The Orator with loud applause. The task is complete and it is clear that Tusi Tamasese's casting in the deep sea has yielded a successful catch. Just as Pili's legendary fishing returned with plenty for all who meditated and prayed, Tusi has similarly fished in the deep ocean of filmmaking. The catch is thus displayed (a Samoan saying) and the globe can appreciate its idiosyncratic beauty, revealing complexities, and pricelessness. Taulelei's mythical prediction that everything would turn out well is an appropriate metaphor with which to rain praises about The Orator. Word about this son of Samoa's filmmaking achievements has spread via the news papers, television, the Internet, and various other media and publications. It is a jewel and precious ornament of which the Samoan people are proud, particularly since it is rare that such a depiction of their customs, as well as their natural surroundings appears on a big international screen. The Ora tor is a fine mat unpacked for public display, thus revealing the intricacies of Samoa's core beliefs and values. Contemporary views, critique, and research will follow, but this film will stand as a valuable resource for study ing and teaching Samoan language and culture at secondary and tertiary institutions. The Orator is a vibrant work. Con gratulations for a job well done! MYRA MCFARLAND-TAUTAU AND GALUMALEMANA AFELETI HUNKIN Victoria University of Wellington</page></plain_text>
