Papers presented to Professor Alan Wace to commemorate fifty years of work in archaeology, vii, 252 pages, 25 plates, 38 figures. The British School at Athens, London 1951 £3.3.0 The British School at Athens has de- voted the forty-sixth volume of its an- nual to commemorate the fiftieth anni- versary in archaeology of one of its most illustrious members, for several years its Director, Professor Alan J. B. Wace. The tribute consists of a Greek epigram by his colleague at Cambridge, D. S. Robertson, twenty-nine articles by colleagues, students, and friends - British, American, French, German, Greek, Swedish, and Egyptian- and fi- nally a bibliography of Wace's pub- lications from 1903 to 1950, compiled by his student Helen Thomas Water- house. The bibliography is in a sense a biography of Wace's fifty years in the field; it shows his versatility from the very beginning, for among his earliest publications are articles on Greek pre- history, Classical excavation, topogra- phy, sculpture, numismatics, Medi- aeval sculpture, and Greek textiles. The scope of his interest grew rather than narrowed to one specialization; instead he became a specialist and an eminent authority in several fields, most notably Aegean prehistory and textiles. The scope of the articles collected in this anniversary volume is again indi- cative of these broad interests, for they cover the many fields to which Wace has contributed during his unusually Y The Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies X Y (founded 1879) Y y The Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies y y (founded 1910) V V* The Societies were founded to promote knowledge of the Hellenic and Roman worlds, their X Y archaeology, art and history. jf Ä i Each Society holds quarterly meetings and publishes a Journal containing well-illustrated A A contributions of great importance to research, and reviews of recent publications.

It is fitting that eight of the articles are on Aegean prehistory, for Wace's contributions to this field have been of the greatest importance, including not only his own work and that in which he has collaborated, but also the ever increasing contributions of his students. Professor Blegen, whose name has so often been joined with that of Wace, has given a brief survey of pre-Classical Greece, in which is in- cidentally made clear what a large rôle Wace played in the growth of the sub- ject. Other articles consider Minoan glyptic art (F. Chapouthier), the face-urns of Anatolia which form a link between the Near East and Troy (W. Lamb), the Syrian, and later Egyptian, influence on the Minoan palaces (A. W. Lawrence), the Aè-, gean megaron as compared with the ARCHAEOLOGY A Publication of the ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA Constituent of the American Council of Learned Societies AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWSLETTER BULLETIN ARCHAEOLOGY MONOGRAPHS Annual Subscription with Institute Membership $10.00 Address: The General Secretary, Archaeological Institute of America, Andover Hall, Cambridge 38, Massachusetts Annual Subscription $5.00 Use This Convenient Form: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - ____________ . _ ________ - I I I Business Manager, ARCHAEOLOGY I I Andover Hall I I Cambridge 38, Massachusetts ' I I enclose check (money order) for Please send Archaeology to: I ¡ name , I street I !

Schweit- zer), the identification of individual artists who decorated Mycenaean pot- tery (F. Stubbings), and Mycenaean quiver ornaments (A. W. Persson). In the field of Classical sculpture, Ashmole writes on the pose of the Blacas head in the British Museum, Jenkins on some evidence for the his- tory of the bronze Athena at Byzan- tium. In Epigraphy, Zaki Aly pub- lishes a stele from Hermopolis Magna, where Wace has recently been excavat- ing, Meritt and Andrewes a new text of an Athenian decree concerning Ne- apolis, Tod some laudatory epithets on Greek epitaphs, and Woodward some notes on Spartan lists of victorious "ball players." For Greek vases there are articles on a fine geometric amphora in the Stathatos Collection (J. Cook), a seventh century anthropomorphic jug from Samos (E. Buschor), a hoplito- dromos cup (J. D. Beazley), on the place of vase-painting in Greek Art (M. Robertson), and on accidental and intentional red glaze on Athenian vases (G. M. A. Richter). Architec- ture too is considered in an article by R. M. Cook on the origin of the tri- glyph, in a reconstruction of the tomb of Porsena at Clusium by J. L. Myres, and in an article by A. Boethius on the reception halls of the Roman em- perors. Celebrating Professor Wace's interest in the post-Classical world are accounts of a Byzantine manuscript at Cambridge (E. H. Minns), post-By- zantine figured silks (D. Talbot Rice), and modern Greek folk tales (R. M. Dawkins). In this widely varied col- lection are also included studies in Homeric archaeology, Greek religion and mythology. It would be difficult to select any articles from this group as being significant above the others; all are short studies of considerable in- terest and scholars in many fields will profit by them, just as they have prof- ited from the works in similar fields of Professor Wace.
