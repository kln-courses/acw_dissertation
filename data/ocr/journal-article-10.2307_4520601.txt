Aside from a few investigations of the region's natural his- tory and the interrelationships between bison and Indians, eastern Montana and the northern plains have received little attention from environmental historians. Robert Kelley Schneiders attempts to fill that gap in Big Sky Rivers, arguing that the upper Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers were, and to a lesser extent still are, "the center of a tremen- Relive the Journey of Lewis &amp; Clark Wi Grab a V11,1d1&amp; travel the waters that Lewis &amp; Clark paddled nearly 200 years ago.

Linked by hydrology, ecology, history, and geography, the two rivers are the lifeblood of the area. According to Schneiders, Indians lived sustain- ably within the region while Euramericans have altered the ecological balance of the region through the elimination of the bison, dam building, and cattle grazing. While Schneiders provokes readers to think about the management of this vast area, his story has many short- comings. Throughout the book he fails to provide ade- quate citations for his material and seems to substitute conjecture for fact. For example, half of chapter 8 is about Montana reclamationists' attempts to impound rivers in Yellowstone National Park, but Schneiders provides only two sources for this story. Likewise, other parts of his book rely on early explorers' accounts that, while they may be all he has to work with, provide scanty evidence for such broad-brush claims as the subject of conversation in Indian villages (p. ioo) or that bison are responsible (at least in part) for the flatness of the Great Plains (p. 78). Schneiders's story also suffers from some startling historiographical and historical omissions. For example, in concluding that we should return bison to the northern plains, Schneiders fails to mention that Frank and Deborah Popper have risked their careers promoting the same idea. Likewise, Schneiders believes that male machismo was responsible for the elimination of the bison from the plains. Kenneth L.

Shepard Krech's controversial argument that indigenous peoples' use of resources often exceeded the land's carrying capacity goes without mention as well. The book also fails to address the Homestead Act and its con- sequences for the northern plains, adding a major histori- cal omission to the scholarly ones. While there is much of interest in his book, Schneiders's account suffers from too much fictionalizing and would have been better if he had focused only on the Yellowstone River or eastern Montana. Still, he does succeed in remind- ing us that this region, though altered, possesses significant ecological integrity and potential for restoration. MichaelJ5.

TEN TURTLES TO TUCUMCARI A Personal History of the Railway Express Agency by Klink Garrett with Toby Smith University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 2003. Illustrations, bibliography, index. xiv + 172 pp. $27.95 cloth. One of the largest delivery services in the United States, the Railway Express Agency (REA) was an important part of daily life in this country for nearly five decades, offering many of the delivery services we now associate with the computer age. Klink Garrett spent virtually his entire adult life with REA, starting as an extra assistant at Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1935 and rising quickly through the ranks to become a REA government traffic manager, then a com- pany director. Three years after Garrett retired in 1976, a bankruptcyjudge oversaw the sale of the REA's assets, and the company vanished. Garrett had a personal view of both the company's success and its demise, and he offers an insider's perspective on both. Express companies served a variety of functions. Read- ers may be surprised to learn that the REA handled much of the movement of cut flowers as well as the produce, cream and milk, and other perishables sold in grocery stores. Sears, Montgomery Ward, and J. C. Penney sent their mail-order merchandise by express, not parcel post. As Garrett notes, many current services such as overnight delivery, special handling, and shipment tracking were rou- tine aspects of REA operations. The company emphasized outstanding customer service, and a person willing to work hard could advance.
