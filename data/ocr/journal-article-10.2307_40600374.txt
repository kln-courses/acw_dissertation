We followed 93 nests in 2004 and 97 nests in 2005. The average (± SD) clutch size was 2.09 ± 0.64 in 2004 and 1.93 ± 0.59 in 2005. Hatching success was 74% in 2004 and 53% in 2005, and fledging success was 54% in 2004 and 58% in 2005. Chicks grew quickly, following the linear equation y(t) = 61g + 17.03g X age (in days), and began to fly at 40 days. Received 11 August 2008. Accepted 28 August 2009. The Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) (Family Laridae) is widely distributed in the Southern Hemisphere, occurring in South America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the sub- Antarctic islands, and the Antarctic Peninsula (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). It is a resident and common species in Brazil, occurring from Rio de Janeiro to the coast of Rio Grande do Sul (Sick 1997). This species usually establishes colonies with few to thousands of breeding pairs on islets and islands near the continent and on continental locations (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). Studies have report- ed a large increase in Kelp Gull populations in recent decades (Steele and Hockey 1989, Quin- tana and Yorio 1998). The Kelp Gull population at Peninsula Valdez, Argentina, increased from 3,200 to 6,500 pairs over a 10-year period (Quintana and Yorio 1998). This population growth has been attributed to enhanced post- fledging survival of juveniles due to the provision of supplementary food through anthropomorphic activities (Steele and Hockey 1989, 1991; Bertel- lotti and Yorio 1999). Some authors believe gull population growth has been involved in displacement of other seabird species from breeding sites (Thomas 1972; Burger 1979, 1985; Quintana and Yorio 1998). Kelp Gulls have been observed to prey on eggs and chicks of Magellanic Penguin (Sphenis- cus magellanicus), Imperial Shag (Leucocarbo atriceps), Royal Tern (Sterna maxima), Cayenne Tern (S. eurygnatha) and Southern Giant Petrel (Macronectes giganteas) (Yorio et al. 1998). Effects of gulls on coastal wildlife are not confined to other seabirds. Thomas (1988) and 1 Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, Rua do Matão, 277, São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Cep: 05508-090. 2 Corresponding author; e-mail: giseledantas@mail.icav.up.pt, dantasgpm@gmail.com Rowntree et al. (1998) observed Kelp Gulls injuring Right whales (Eubalaena australis) by picking off skin and fat when the whales emerge at the surface to breathe. These authors argue that intense harassment by gulls induces Right whales to abandon breeding areas before their young are sufficiently strong for the open sea. Little is known about the breeding biology of the Kelp Gull despite its wide distribution and its great impact on other seabirds and mammals. (Crawford et al. 1982, Soares and Fonseca Schielfler 1995, Yorio et al. 1996, Yorio and Borboroglu 2002). Breeding biology studies are essential to understand the dynamics of a population, because changes in population size may result from processes of reproduction, survival, and migration (Doherty and Grubb 2002). Reproductive success is associated with several factors, including ecological conditions (intra- and inter- specific interactions, food avail- ability, breeding site, etc.), and weather conditions (humidity, temperature, and wind) (Paynter 1949, Borboroglu and Yorio 2004). Studies that seek to understand long term survival and mortality rates in a population may be efficient for monitoring environmental change. An estimate of reproduc- tive success is also essential for evaluating population growth. This information is needed to create future conservation programs for seabird communities. We studied the breeding biology of the Kelp Gull on the south Brazilian coast. Our objectives were to: (1) measure the incubation period, (2) ascertain clutch size, (3) measure prédation rate, (4) identify predators, (5) calculate the length of time required for chicks to become independent, and (6) measure the growth rate of chicks. METHODS Study Area. - Data were collected on Guarar- itama Islet, São Paulo, Brazil (24° 23' S, 39</page><page sequence="2">40 THE WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY • Vol. 122, No. 1, March 2010 46° 59' W). This islet is 1.9 km from the continent and has an area of 1.2 ha with a rocky substrate, and shrub and grass-herb vegetation. Campos et al. (2004) estimated the Larus dominicanus population on Guararitama to be 100 breeding pairs. Field Procedures. - We visited the islet every 5 to 7 days during 2004 and 2005 from the end of June to mid-November We recorded egg-laying dates, clutch sizes, egg measurements (length, width, and mass), chick measurements (mass, wing length, tarsus length, and beak length) and hatching dates. We measured eggs and chicks to the nearest 0.1 mm using calipers and to the nearest 1.0 g using a Pesóla scale. We marked all Kelp Gull nests on Guararitama Islet with satin tape. We marked eggs with a waterproof pen and chicks with satin tape, until they reached an appropriate size to receive a metal ring provided by CEMAVE/IBAMA (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renováveis). Nests were kept under surveillance throughout the breeding season to estimate survival, prédation, and abandonment rates. A nest was considered active when it was well formed and contained eggs. It was considered to have been predated when broken eggs were found inside or near the nests, or when eggs disappeared without sign of hatching (e.g., excrement of the chicks). Nests were considered abandoned when eggs remained for 40 days without hatching. We defined hatching success as the number of chicks per eggs laid and fledging success as the number of chicks alive after 28 days per eggs laid (Mougeot and Bretagnolle 2006). Statistical Analysis. - Egg volume was calculat- ed following Hoyt (1979): V = length X width2 X 0.5 1 . We estimated the number of females by the number of breeding pairs (bx), assuming that each nest consisted of one pair. The estimated number of females was used to calculate fecundity (fx) and fertility (mx) (Pianka 2000): bx = number of nests, fx = number of eggs laid/number of females, and mx = number of surviving eggs/number of females. Two distinct peaks were observed in egg laying in 2004 and 2005. The 2004 breeding season was subdivided into an early and a later period, and the 2005 breeding season was divided into early, intermediate, and later periods, because the first peak was later in 2005. Differences within and between breeding seasons in egg volume and clutch size were evaluated with a /-test. Survival rates of offspring, hatching success, and fledging success were compared between breeding seasons using a x2 test- Chicks captured on the day of hatching and at least one additional time during the breeding season (n = 17) were used to estimate the growth equation. We fitted the von Bertalanffy, Gom- pertz, and logistic three-parameter growth equa- tions (Ricklefs 1967) to the data on chick mass using least squares procedures to analyze chick growth patterns. We analyzed the variance of the residuals distribution to identify which models best fit the data, and chose the model with low variance. We estimated the age of all other chicks captured only once during the breeding season based on the chosen growth equation. Growth curves that best fit the body size measurements (beak, tarsus, and wing length) were calculated using von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and logistic three-parameter functions. RESULTS The Kelp Gull breeding season on Guararitama Islet began in mid-June and ended in early November. The first eggs were found on 24 June in 2004 and on 30 June in 2005. Egg laying continued until October with the last eggs being laid on 31 October in 2004 and 28 October in 2005. We recorded 195 eggs in 93 nests in 2004 and 172 eggs in 97 nests in 2005. Egg laying in both years showed two peaks during the breeding season. The first peak in 2004 occurred in July (93 eggs) and the second in September (102 eggs). The first peak in 2005 was in August (53 eggs) and the second in October (40 eggs) (Fig. 1). Mean (± SD) clutch size was 2.09 ± 0.64 (n = 93) in 2004 and 1.93 ± 0.59 (n = 97) in 2005. The difference between the years was not significant (t = 1.77, P = 0.07). The average (± SD) incubation length was 24.12 ± 4.48 days in 2004 and 22.78 ± 3.27 days in 2005. The number of breeding females (bx) was 93 in 2004 and 97 in 2005. Fecundity (fx) was 2.096 in 2004 and 1.773 in 2005, and fertility (mx) was 1.387 in 2004 and 0.422 in 2005. Estimated egg volume differed between the two peaks of each breeding season (2004: t = 4.34, P &lt; 0.001; 2005: t = 2.24, P = 0.026). This difference cannot be attributed to the first peak consisting mainly of the first eggs laid by each</page><page sequence="3">Dantas and Morgante • BREEDING BIOLOGY OF KELP GULLS 41 FIG. 1 .

The average volume of eggs laid during the first peak in 2004 was 88.11 ± 8.28 cm3, while that of eggs laid during the second peak was 83.80 ± 12.68 cm3. The average egg volume during the early period in 2005 was 87.01 ± 8.12 cm3. The average egg volume during the first peak (intermediate period) was 87.18 ± 9.01 cm3, and the average egg volume during the second peak (later period) was 82.43 ± 12.97 cm3. The difference in egg volume between 2004 and 2005 was significant (t = 1.99, P = 0.046) with a mean (± SD) of 86.32 ± 10.37 cm3 in 2004 and 84.13 ± 10.75 cm3 in 2005 (Fig. 2). The first peak of the season produced greater hatching success than the second peak in both years (2004: f = 10.09, P = 0.006; 2005: %2 = 7.11, P = 0.03) (Table 1). Hatching success was greater in 2004 than in 2005 (x2 = 18.13, P &lt; 0.01) (Fig. 3). Prédation was the principal cause of egg loss (25.6% in 2004 and 69.9% in 2005) and death of chicks (34.9% and 5.8%). The principal predators of Kelp Gulls were Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) on eggs and adult Kelp Gulls on chicks. Heat stress also affected loss of eggs and chicks. Air temperature can reach 33° C during the late breeding season in Guararitama and, on hot days, the chicks appear lethargic and had difficulty breathing. Thus, they become easy prey for vultures and other raptors. Environmental data from Iguape Meteorological Station, Cptec/INPE, (www.cptec.inpe.br) for the breeding period indicated that 2005 was hotter than 2004, but the years did not differ in precipitation (temper- FIG. 2.

Field observations indicated that chicks grew rapidly, remaining in the nest until they were 5 days of age. When chicks were 5 to 15 days of age, they moved around the island and become more visible to predators. Chicks were able to avoid predators after 30 days of age. They reached</page><page sequence="4">42 THE WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY • Vol. 122, No. 1, March 2010 TABLE 1.

Chicks were flying at 40 days of age. The survival rate to fledging was 54% in 2004 and 58% in 2005 (X2 = 1.79; P = 0.1798). Three possible growth functions were com- pared (i.e., von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and logistic functions). The variance of the residual distributions indicated the models did not differ significantly, and we present results only from the logistic equation. The logistic equation for body weight of 17 Kelp Gull chicks is weight (mass) = A/(1+B*EXP{-C*(days)}) (parameter values are in Table 2). We were able to predict the ages of chicks from their measured body mass using this curve. When chick mass increased linearly between 5 and 35 days of age, we derived a simplified formula: y = y0 + at, where y0 is birth mass (mean mass on day of hatching = 61 g); a is the estimated growth rate of 17.03 g/day, and t is age in days (Fig. 4). We observed rapid growth in all of the measured traits (beak, tarsus, and wing length) (Fig. 5). These measurements were fitted to growth models, and there were no significant differences among models (parameters estimated for the logistic three-parameter model, Table 2). FIG. 3. Hatching and fledging success rates (%) of Kelp Gulls during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons, on Guararitama Islet, São Paulo, Brazil. DISCUSSION The Kelp Gull breeding season on Guararitama Islet was similar in both years, starting in mid- June and ending in early November. This same pattern was reported for the Santa Catarina coast in southern Brazil (Soares and Fonseca Schielfler 1995, Branco 2003), although Prellvitz et al. (2009) reported egg laying began on 1 June on Moleques do Sul, Santa Catarina. The Kelp Gull in Argentina reproduces from November to January in central and northern Patagonia (Bor- boroglu and Yorio 2004) and in mid-October in the Valdez Peninsula (Yorio and Borboroglu 2002). Yorio and Borboroglu (2002) report the Kelp Gull breeding season shows a direct relationship with latitude with gulls breeding earlier in more northern colonies. Laying stages may be related to latitude and to climatic conditions of the breeding localities (Fordham 1964). Clutch size of Kelp Gulls on the Brazilian coast varies from one to three eggs. This clutch size has been reported for Kelp Gulls in Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa (Saliva and Burger 1989, Soares and Fonseca Schielfler 1995, Branco 2003, Borboroglu and Yorio 2004, Prellvitz et al. 2009), and for other species of Larus in temperate regions (Paynter 1949, Kadlec and Drury 1968). The average clutch size in our study (2.09 in 2005 TABLE 2. Logistic growth model parameters.

Growth (mass) of Kelp Gull chicks on Guararitama Islet, São Paulo, Brazil. and 1.95 in 2005) is comparable to that of other studies in Patagonia, Argentina (2.3-2.5 eggs, Yorio and Borboroglu 2002), southern Brazil (2.3 eggs, Soares and Fonseca Schielfler 1995; 1.98- 2.26 eggs, Branco 2003; 1.97 eggs, Prellvitz et al. 2009), and the Antarctic Peninsula (2.5 eggs, Fraser 1989). There were two peaks of egg laying at Guararitama Islet in both years. However, Yorio and Borboroglu (2002) in Argentina and Saliva and Burger (1989) in South Africa observed only one laying peak for Kelp Gulls. We believe the bimodal egg laying at Guararitama Islet may be a consequence of environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity. Prellvitz et al. (2008) reported Kelp Gull colonies are smaller in warmer and less productive waters, suggesting that environmental conditions can influ- ence size and reproductive success of colonies. Egg size is related to the ability of the female to obtain food resources throughout the laying period (Herbert and Barclay 1988). We observed significant differences in egg volume between the two laying peaks during each breeding season (Fig. 2). Females produced larger eggs during the early period than during the later period. Skórka et al. (2005) have shown that food availability is reduced late in the breeding season. Thus, older pairs breeding early in the season are expected to have better success/survival than younger pairs due to greater experience and provisioning skills. Additionally, smaller average egg volume was observed in 2005 than in 2004 (t = 1.99; P = 0.046). These differences may reflect environ- mental changes that influence chick survival.

The air temper- ature during the 2004 breeding season ranged from 17° to 36° C, and during 2005 from 17.5° to 40° C (Iguape Meteorological Station). Borbor- oglu and Yorio (2004) reported the breeding season of Kelp Gulls at Isla Vernacci, southwest-</page><page sequence="6">44 THE WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY • Vol. 122, No. 1, March 2010 ern Argentina, ends in the middle of January, when the temperature reaches 40° C. By that time, the chicks are already flying. Salzman (1982) reported that temperatures above 32° C are harmful to chicks of Larus occidentalism often causing death. Salzman (1982) reported that stress caused by excessive heat is one of the main causes for egg loss and chick mortality. The high mortality observed in 2005 may have been due to high temperatures recorded through- out the breeding season, which left nests exposed to predators. The principal cause of egg loss (25.6% in 2004, 69.9% in 2005) at Guararitama was prédation by vultures, while the principal cause of chick mortality (34.9% in 2004, 25.0% in 2005) was prédation by adult Kelp Gulls. Borboroglu and Yorio (2004) reported egg loss of 28% and chick morality of 50%. These authors also reported chick prédation by adults of the same species. They believe that chick prédation by adults of the same species occurs when chicks invade breeding territories, searching for shade and protection under vegetation. Prédation can be reduced by parental care and by selection of a more hidden site for nest building (Borboroglu and Yorio 2004). Other predators observed to prey on eggs and chicks of Kelp Gulls includes Subantartic Skuas (Stercorarius antarcticus) and Southern Crested Caracarà {Caracarà plancus) (Yorio et al. 1995, Sick 1997, Yorio and Borboroglu 2002). Howev- er, Prellvitz et al. (2009) observed parental negligence and starvation to be the main mortality factor for eggs and chick Kelp Gulls, respectively, on Deserta Island. The number of eggs abandoned and chick death by starvation was small (&lt;5%) in our study. Pierotti and Bellrose (1986) reported that high losses from parental negligence or egg fertility could indicate lower food availability or inferior food quality. Prellvitz et al. (2009) reported 51% hatching success on Deserta Island, similar to that in 2005 on Guararitama Islet. However, hatching success on Guararitama in 2004 was 74%, similar to that reported by Yorio and Borboroglu (2002) at Peninsula Valdez, Argentina. These differences may be related to environmental variability in temperature and humidity. Stable years can have great hatching and fledging success and hotter years can result in great mortality from prédation or starvation. Kelp Gull chicks grow rapidly and this species displays parental care during incubation and feeding of chicks. Borboroglu and Yorio (2004) reported that parental care gradually decreases over the breeding season, increasing prédation risk. Kelp Gull chicks start to move around the island after 5 days of age. This movement, when they are only a few days of age, seems to be a behavioral characteristic (Yorio et al. 1996). Chicks weigh 800 g at 35 days and are already flying. Capture by predators at this phase is difficult. Yorio and Borboroglu (2002) also observed rapid growth of chick Kelp Gulls in colonies on the coast of Argentina. Prellvitz et al. (2009) reported that most chick mortality on Deserta Island, Brazil, occurred in the first week of life. This rapid growth rate may represent an evolutionary adaptation for escape from predators. Kelp Gulls breed on the Brazilian coast during the winter, probably to avoid higher summer temperatures and to seek better conditions for embryo development. Individuals that breed early in the season have an advantage over pairs breeding later in the season. The main predators of eggs and chick Kelp Gulls are Black Vultures, whose impact is greatest at the egg stage, and adult Kelp Gulls, which prey on young chicks. Chicks have rapid growth, probably as a means of avoiding predators. Despite the high prédation rate observed in 2005 (a hotter year), Kelp Gulls had a high survival rate (54% in 2004 and 58% in 2005). If these chicks survive to the reproductive stage, this suggests an incremental population growth rate of 50% each year. This population growth may pose a serious problem for the conservation of other seabirds.
