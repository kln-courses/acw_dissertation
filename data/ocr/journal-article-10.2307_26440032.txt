<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AND CHAOS By Huntington Cairns M MALRAUX believes that art is Allah, man is its prophet, and destiny the villain that man # must overcome in the service of his god. This means, in M. Malraux's system, that destiny is evil, man is the creative principle, and art the supreme value—the Good. Today it is the fashion to believe that value—the principle that the Greeks called reason and the Middle Ages God—is the creation of man. Existence creates essence is the creed of Existentialism. For M. Malraux the new God is art, and it is forever coming to life. The discovery that art is an end in itself is, for him, man's unprecedented step, his resurrec tion, his freedom wrung from the clutches of chaotic destiny. Man, in turning once again from "appearance," which is illusion, to "otherness," which is art, is triumphing over chaos. Egyptian art occupied itself with death, Greek art with life, Gothic art with truth, baroque art with charm, but modern art alone is concerned only with art. Previously art was fragmentary, impure, a handmaiden of absolutes other than itself. Vermeer was the harbinger of modern art, its John the Baptist, but 1870 was the year of the resurrection. Thus up to the year 1870 art was only partially right, for The Twilight of the Absolute. By André Malraux. Translated by Stuart Gilbert. The Bollingen Series XXIV.

Malraux as the music in man's soul, and through this music man brings forth art, and through art he brings order into a chaotic universe. How man, with such a musical soul, ever came to be in the midst of so much chaos is not clear. Even Athene sprang from the brain of Zeus, and Aphrodite from the sea, and Christ from a womb however virginal; but man—the creator of God, order, and the universe—more miraculously than any of these, sprang one day from chaos itself. M. Malraux lived some years in the East, and per haps this doctrine is a reflection of the Taoist principle that Being originated in Non-Being. In any event, the idea that Everything came from Nothing, or from what M. Sartre calls le néant, is ingrained in Existentialism. Art, man, and destiny would therefore appear to be the new trinity. In ancient Greek thought generally, the notion was held that law is supreme, that the universe is free from contra diction, that man's humanness lies in his ability to know, and that his salvation consists in his coming to understand the external order of which he is a part. Christian theology in some of its branches stressed the idea—which philosophers of Spinoza's naturalistic outlook have resisted, but Des cartes accepted—that a benevolent Being who orders the universe can be persuaded to intervene in, to arrest in our favor, the logic of things. M. Malraux's idea, which is ascendant in contemporary thought, is that man is rational and the universe disorderly. Modern man's problem, as he sees it, is therefore not to make himself more rational, as the Greeks thought, but to impart his own rationality to the universe. There are many indications from science, art, phi losophy, and history that we are at the beginning of a new cultural pattern. To M. Malraux man, working through art, has planned it that way. There is no denying that art is a force of great power in men's affairs, and it may even be that it fulfills the function of the philosophers' stone in the promotion of a happy life. But M. Malraux's esthetic view</page><page sequence="3">ART AND CHAOS 613 of causation, however flattering to art, is a return to the level of naïve anthropomorphism which has always been a hin drance to the development of a clear theory of social change. M. Malraux also gives great emphasis to the idea of meta morphosis. In his view cultures less enlightened than ours at tribute false meanings to works of art. With the passage of time these meanings disappear and the values of the works of art become, for us, formal. Statues of Buddha, for ex ample, no longer for us have the meaning that was first associated with them; we see them as pure works of art. New meanings are also added to works of art by the proc esses of weathering and decay. Similarly, the development of a new technique, as for instance photography, will bring into our homes reproductions of objects we would not other wise have seen; and the devices through which miniature works can today be enlarged also reveal new values. M. Mal raux also discusses metamorphosis in terms of form rather than meaning. He shows through the medium of an admira ble series of photographic enlargements of Celtic coins the extent to which later art builds on earlier forms. In the so called "eye coins," the eye of the original portrait has cap tured the whole surface, and the eye encloses the elements of the former profile. In painting the story is very much the same. Latour deliberately took over from Caravaggio his figures, his lighting, his colors, and his association of dark backgrounds with red drapery. Yet he achieved a style entirely dissimilar to Caravaggio's through the device of rendering volumes as though they were surfaces in flat planes. In the end it is clear that Latour took nothing; he did not improve, he transformed. Interest in metamorphosis leads M. Malraux to what he calls pluralism or universal humanism. He advocates the annexation by us of forms that are alien to us. M. Malraux may here be handing us a cup of hemlock. In painting and sculpture the Romans imported Greek forms, but there were no native Latours equal to the task of metamorphosis at the</page><page sequence="4">614 THE VIRGINIA QUARTERLY REVIEW level of great art. In two directions—civil engineering as exemplified in the Pantheon, and the portrait bust as in the likenesses of Vespasianus and Pompey—Rome was able to achieve a metamorphosis equal to Latour's achievement. Perhaps she was able to do this because the civil engineer and the portrait sculptor not only had the requisite ability, but the task set them presented challenges that a simple imitation of Greek forms could not meet. In painting and sculpture, where the utilitarian stimulus may be altogether absent, the dangers of imitation are visible in all the museums of the world. If we are living in an age of Latours M. Malraux's suggestion has much to recommend it. But there is the possibility, which has not passed unnoticed by some observers, that we may be living in an Alexandrian period. "The Twilight of the Absolute" is the third and last vol ume of M. Malraux's "Psychology of Art." It is suggestive, stimulating, impressionistic, and hurries through space and time, dipping here and there, as a humming bird dips seek ing flowers. The path runs from Sung China to Cezanne, from Trobriand Islanders to Egyptian tombs and back again. Little in the world of art escapes inspection. It is a notable achievement and somewhat reminiscent of the vol umes of Elie Faure, but with a less systematic approach.</page></plain_text>
