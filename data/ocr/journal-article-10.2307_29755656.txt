<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Archaeological Traces of Old Turks in Mongolia by Edward Tryjarski The area of the Mongolian People's Republic is famous as the place where many nomadic tribes had their origin. From there great masses of nomads emerged and set off for military expansion, over many centuries numerous steppe states, often based on ephemeral political ties, originated and perished there. This vast territory offers excellent conditions for a fruitful scientific exploration, provided that the research work is made on a wider basis. It is generally known that there the ethnographical material alternates with historical material, sociological problems with purely religious matters, whereas a philological study must often be preceded by research of a purely archaeological nature. I was aware of all these and some other difficulties while preparing intensively for a scientific expedition to Mongolia in the autumn of 1963. I owed this mainly to the kindness of the Polish and the Mongolian Academies of Science, the friendly help of Mongolian col? leagues and to a lucky coincidence as well. As far as the formal organisation of my journey was concerned, this was based on the agreement of mutual scientific collaboration between both the above-mentioned Academies. The crux of the matter lay, however, in the vivid con? trast between the many important and theoretically realizable aims of this mini-expedition and the subjective highly limited possibilities of its single participant (in the course of my trip in the provinces I was assisted only by one Mongolian colleague and a car driver). Besides, my main aim was quite a limited one: the acquisition of a new documentation for the oldest monuments of Turkish language and literature ? famous inscriptions on the stelae in memory of the Turkish rulers and chiefs on the Ongin, Orkhon, Selenga and Tola Rivers. This was in direct connection with a recent repeated demand from Turkologists for a revision of existing editions of the texts mentioned above or even for the production of new improved editions. It is generally known that the texts in question are the basis for Turkish philo? logy* a fundamental source of political history and culture of ancient Turkish tribes and their languages. The main scope of my journey to Mongolia being realized to the best of my ability, some thirty days spent in that country also enabled me to make a number of broader observations which thus have the character of a by-product. They are chiefly due to contacts with some Mongolian scholars active in other fields and to their kind assistance. The results of my travel can be summed up as follows: some 1500 km. covered by car during 11 days spent on the trip in the provinces on the territories of four aimaks (the Central aimak, the ?v?r-Khangai aimak, the Aral-Khangai aimdk and the Bulgan aimak), a series of paper squeezes taken from these and some other minor runic inscriptions, more 121</page><page sequence="2">than 400 photographs and a short feature film. The film and the photographs represent mainly the Turkish monuments, but there are also some concerning monuments of a later history of the country, before all the architecture and the objects of Lamaistic religion, popular customs, everyday life etc. (*). All this material, of which only a part has been published so far, met with kind acceptance by Turkologists and historians of Central Asia? tic culture (2). Most of the photographs included in the present paper have never been pub? lished. The photographs designated as figs. 8, 13-15, 25 I have received thanks to Mr Rinchen, the academician and also Mr G. Namkhaidagva, the director of the local Museum in Arvaikher. I am greatly indebted to them for their kind help. The pictures numbered figs. 3-6, 17, 19, 21 and 24 are enlarged frames of a cinecamera film and this is why some of them are out of focus. There is no doubt that a study of archaeological relics in Mongolia should, in our times, be based on much more precise methods of research than those dating from many decades ago and on quite modern techniques as well, since the lack of proper equipment inevitably entails a lowering of the standards of the results obtained. It is evidently true that the results achieved by the great explorers of Asia towards the end of the 19th and at the beginning of 20th cent, should still be valued and admired but, at the same time, one realizes that many of those results should be verified, if possible, by methods in use today and that the research work should go deeper in many respects. Yet, it sounds sheer nonsense to postulate, for instance, the Carbon-14 method, the use of aeroplanes for ex? ploring sites or of ultrasonic methods for analysing pottery etc., whereas a good strati graphic analysis is probably not always in regular use and the problem of preventing unique objects from deteriorating sub Jove seems to be insoluble (figs. 1-6). This certain? ly is not the fault of a small group of Mongolian experts in the field who with admirable endeavour and good will are taking great pains in order to explore their vast country archaeologically (3). At the same time, one cannot help feeling that our general know? ledge of archaeological relics in Mongolia is far from being sufficiently complete. Speaking of the ? incompleteness ? of any study is, obviously, pure convention but, in our case, it does not seem to be deprived of special significance. As a result of the great extent of the country, its configuration, climate, the use of special means of transport on the one hand, and the few well-trained and rather poorly equipped research groups i1) The main results of this expedition have been given in two reports: E. Tryjarski, ?O stanie zachowania zabytk?w starotureckich w Mon golii i potrzebie ich ochrony (Sprawozdanie z po drozy do Mongolii) ?, Sprawozdania z prac nau kowych Wydzialu Nauk Spolecznych PAN, V, 1962, 5 (27), pp. 125-145; Id., ? The Present State of Preservation of Old Turkic Relics in Mongolia and the Need for their Conservation?, Ural Altaische Jahrb?cher, 38, 1966, pp. 158-173. (2) The report on the journey, illustrated with a film projection, was presented at the 7th meeting of the Permanent International Altaistic Conference in De Pietersberg (near Arnhem, Holland) in 1962. (3) Archaeological exploration of the country is, in substance, carried out exclusively by Mongolian experts since 1950 only, cf. N. Ser-odzav, ? Arheolo giceskie issledovanija v Mongol'skoj Narodnoj Respublike ?, in Mongol'skij Arheologiceskij Sbor nik (Akademija Nauk SSSR), Moskva, 1962, pp. 5-10. 122</page><page sequence="3">with limited financial means on the other, quite numerous areas are being left where pre? cious monuments of the Mongolian past can still be found. This is evidenced by repeated reports of Mongolian experts on new finds in various parts of the country (4) and also by reports of the few foreign scholars who have had a chance to work there. Let us recall, as far as Turkish relics are concerned, the serious achievements of a Czechoslovak-Mon? golian expedition on the Memorial to K?l Tegin, directed by L. Jisl, which culminated in the excavation of a beautiful head belonging to the statue of that famous khan (5), or the location of many important archaeological objects by P. Poucha (6) and J. Schubert. In par? ticular, the German scholar's explorations, made chiefly with Kh. Perle in high mountain ranges, have showed how many surprising objects can be revealed also in regions that are situated high above sea level and difficult of access (7). Archaeological relics of Mongolia and the adjacent areas can be presented in the fol? lowing groups: I. ruins of towns, fortress-cities etc.; 2. burial mounds (kurgans, kerek surs); 3. steppe graves; 4. stone ranges (or stone fences); 5. stone pillars; 6. plastic repre? sentations of persons and animals; 7. petroglyphic images; 8. inscriptions (8). During my stay in Mongolia I had occasion to familiarize myself with the relics of all these groups but, on account of my chief aim, I was unable to give equal attention to all of them, which also concerns the material published so far. In this paper I intend to make up this deficiency by discussing shortly the main groups of all those mentioned above. Ruins of Towns, Fortress-cities etc. It is generally known that the steppe civilizations are not conducive to the formation of urban centres. This is perfectly true also for the Mongolian area and for the Turkish period of its history. Thus the ruins found in that country are mostly those of ancient civil or military administrative centres or of Lamaistic cloisters destroyed during the revo? lutionary period. The ruins of ancient towns and fortress-cities, forts, citadels, most abun (4) The results of research work by Mon? golian archaeologists are mainly published in the series Studia Archaeologica.

(8) I follow here the main lines of the classifica? tion scheme proposed in J. G. Gran?, ? ?ber die geographischen Verbreitung und die Formen der Altert?mer in der Nordwestmongolei ?, Journal de la Societe Finno-Ougrienne, XXVIII, Helsinki, 1912. 123</page><page sequence="4">dant in eastern Khangai, have attracted the attention of many earlier travellers and ex? plorers. As far as Turkish ruins are concerned, it seems, however, that notwithstanding the great achievements of Russian, Finnish and other expeditions, we have still no clear picture either of their distribution over the country or of their particular character. As far as I know, only very few systematic excavations have been carried out in those ruins. In the meanwhile many of the tumuli have been flattened out and grown over with grass. No wonder that at the present time, like some other relics here, they often have to be discovered for the second time. All this being the case, it is, evidently, most difficult to know which of those ruins or which of their strata may in fact be attributed to Turkish tribes. The most common criterion in doubtful cases has been the fact of locating in their vicinity stones covered with inscriptions in Turkish runic or Uighur scripts or bearing pre? sumed Turkish tam^a signs. A description of similar ruins, those of a fortress in Siwet ul?n, on the Hanui and Huni Rivers, has been published by P. Aalto (9). The Soviet^Mongolian expedition in the period 1948-9 succeeded in locating in Mon? golia the ruins of some Hunnic fortresses (gorodisce) (10). Ten similar monuments dating back to the period of Kidan domination were located between 1950 and 1959 During my trip I did not have a chance to examine ruins of this group. I had, how? ever, an opportunity to visit (as many other foreigners coming to Mongolia do) the ruins of Karakorum. It is known that at the main entrances to this town there stood three famous granite sculptures of turtles (the fourth one, which had not been finished by the mason, was discovered by S. V. Kiselev by the Orkhon River at a distance of 12 km. from the ruins) (12). One of these turtles, standing in the vicinity of the Erdene Dzuu monastery is seen in the photograph (fig. 7) (13). It is still very well preserved (see below). A vast area grown over with grass and bushes is covered by thousands of burnt tiles with green glaze, shards, fragments of various vessels etc. Shallow depressions and hollows in the ground reveal the foundations of buildings. It is known that this site was explored for the last time by the expedition conducted by S. V. Kiselev, which has yielded such important results (14), but even a cursory examination of the ruins seems to suggest that excavations were carried out only in certain places and, consequently, that this important work should be resumed and methodically continued. It might prove fruitful again. (9) ?Materialien zu den altt?rkischen In? schriften der Mongolei?, gesammelt von G. J. Ramstedt, J. G. Gran? und P. Aalto, bearbeitet und herausgegeben von P.

Levasova, Drevnemongol'skie goroda, Moskva, 1965. 124</page><page sequence="5">The photograph (fig. 8) shows the ruins of a stone building of which only one corner and the stairs have been preserved. According to Mr Namkhaidagva's helpful information, these are the ruins of a fortress of Khublai Khan, of the Y?an Dynasty, situated in the locality of Teel, in the Khairkhan-dulan somon. It might be worth adding that, at a certain distance from these ruins, a stone baba (fig. 13) has been found. Burial Mounds (kurgans, kereksursj The kurgans (or in the narrower sense a certain type of them only) are called kerek surs (Mong. xirgis-ur, ? graves of the Kirgiz ?) by the Mongols and attributed, as is indi? cated by the name itself, to the period of domination of that tribe (15). As a matter of fact, detailed research work carried out by G. I. Borovko allowed him to come to the conclu? sion that those tumuli belong to the period of the domination of the Turks in Mongolia in the 6th-7th cent. (16). The kurgans today are still a characteristic feature of the steppe landscape, as they were centuries ago, and I could see them often while travelling in the provinces. They are especially numerous in the vicinity of a well-known Mongolian spa Khudzirt on the way from Arvaikher to Kharkhorin (Karakorum). They are found here in hundreds. They are mounds heaped with smaller boulders or pebbles. Their dimensions vary considerably: according to J. G. Gran?, they are from 3 to 100 metres in diameter and up to 3-4 metres high (17). The lowest of them are scarcely discernible on the steppe ground which is naturally covered here and there with stones. J. G. Gran? classifies them in five main types according to the external form of the mound, the existence of borders i.e. stone ranges or low stone fences {Steinsetzungen), sometimes formed also by heaped up small pebble hillocks, the location of a stone pillar etc. It is clear, however, that this clas? sification cannot be too precise since there exist a lot of mixed types. A number of these tumuli have been opened by Soviet and Mongolian archaeologists (18) but it still seems to be true that, as W. Kotwicz has remarked, the time for solving this problem has not come yet and that only a further exploration of those graves that have undoubtedly survived in their original state, could provide decisive arguments (1!&gt;). Our photograph (fig. 9) shows one of the kereksurs in the vicinity of Khudzirt. With regard to external form it belongs to the type designated by J. G. Gran? as number 3: ? a sepulchral mound with a square stone border ? (20). I did not have enough time to take the measurements of that kereksur but it certainly belongs to a medium-sized type. (15) W. Kotwicz, ? Les tombeaux dits ? kerek sur ? en Mongolie ?, Rocznik Orientalistyczny&gt;, VI, 1929, pp. 1-11. K. V. Vjatkina, following G. I. Borovko, reserves the term ? kereksur ? or ? kir gisur ? for smaller mounds framed with circular or square stone borders only, op. cit., p. 94. (16) G. I. Borovko, ?

Here we have relics which J. G. Gran? calls ? steppe graves ? (Steppengr?ber) (21). The large-sized irregular stone blocks and slabs are quite remarkable here. It is difficult to provide a proper interpretation of the block visible in the foreground on the left side of the photograph. The stone is placed behind the stone border and one cannot rule out that it might have served as a stone pillar. Two oblong and flat stones lying parallel on the ground let us suppose that they form the first part of a path leading square to one of the grave sides. Provided that the position of the oblong stones is not accidental, this grave could in some degree be compared with several of Gran?'s type 9 (22). A small number of slab graves were opened by Mongolian archaeologists. Kh. Perle explored, in 1952, some of these graves situated near the upper reaches of the Kerulen River, digging out metal plates, ferrules and beads. Also N. Ser-odzav opened a number of similar graves by the Shonkhlai Mountain, in the region of Khudzirt, bringing to light beads, ceramics etc. In some graves the heads of buried people rested on small stone plates as on pillows (23). Stone Pillars The stone pillars have been grouped by J. G. Gran? under a separate heading al? though they have often been a part of grave memorials (24). As a matter of fact, they are placed either on or close to the steppe grave or kurgan or quite separately. In the latter case, however, most probably they mark a burial place and, consequently, they may be treated as a special form of tombstone. They are stone blocks of various size and shape (their cross-section being rectangular, square, circular or oval) measuring from 1 to 5 metres. They are usually decorated with tamyas (probably belonging to buried people or those who had erected the pillars), repre? sentations of men, animals and various objects (cf. below in a section on petroglyphs). Among these last J. G. Gran? noticed images of Sun, Moon and stars with some lines which he was inclined to interpret as arrows being the symbol of death (25). It seems that some? times they are replaced by natural blocks of stone (fig. 11). Some of the stone pillars are made to resemble human beings by marking hands, eyes (21) ?Die Steppengr?ber, deren oberirdischer Teil von einem kleineren, mit Steinplatten um? stellten Quadrat oder Parallelogramm gebildet wird ? (Gran?, op. cit., p. 20). (22) ? Das Steppengrab mit ausserhalb stehenden Steinpfeilern...?. ?...

Consequently they may be classed with the objects of the following group. Stone babas and balbals Travelling in the provinces and examining a number of objects kept in the museums I was in a position to get acquainted with the main types of stone babas and b alb als. The problem of their proper interpretation is a long standing one and as no satisfactory solution has been found yet, it still rouses interest. It has many aspects: archaeological, historical and ethnical, pertaining to the history of universal culture and to religion and the funeral rites probably not only of the Turkish tribes. Literature on the subject amounts to 200 items. On account of the wide distribution of these relics in space and in time (the ex? istence of similar objects, having probably the same function, has been confirmed on the Eurasian continent from China's western frontiers up to the Baltic Sea and Spain) their study is usually limited (with some detriment to the study of the problem as a whole) to some ethnical, chronological and territorial frame work. Recent studies by Ja. A. Ser, limited to Semirece, being the territory of the Turkish West Kaghanate (26), are merely based on the latter principle, but at the same time are of great importance also for all adjacent areas, including Mongolia. Notwithstanding the fact that this problem has been discussed for many decades, the following fundamental questions have not been convincingly an? swered yet: what is the actual difference between the balbals and the stone babas; what is their origin and what are the stages of their evolution; which sculptures represent buried Turks and which ones their enemies killed by them; what is the real meaning and sense of placing those statues; what sort of connection is there between them and the Turks' belief in an afterlife; what is the meaning of various objects represented on the stone babas, espe? cially of drinking bowls; whether it was the sculptors' intention to cut portraits of people who actually existed; what is the chronology and artistic value of these objects. Opinions in these matters can be reduced to two main hypotheses: 1) The balbals represent the most powerful enemies killed or won by the eminent Turk during his life-time. By placing an image of the enemy on the grave or near a commemorative construction, the relatives and those near and dear hoped to secure the dead a menial service in the afterlife (V. V. Bartol'd, N. I. Veselovskij, while A. D. Grac has made an attempt at proving the ad? ditional political and social implications of the practice). 2) The majority of stone sculptures of this type represent the Turks themselves and the sculptures used to be placed either on graves or on the place where the body was cremated (D. Klementz, G. N. Potanin, L. N. Gumilev, L. R. Kyzlasov). According to A. N. Bernstam, among the sculptures there were both portraits of dead persons and generalized representations of the dead person's servants in the afterlife (2T). Ja. A. Ser is right in stating that hypothesis no. 2 does not contradict hypothesis no. 1. Ja. A. Ser extracts ? a rational part ? from the latter, saying that ? on (26) Ja. A. Ser, Kamennye izvajanija Semirec'ja, Moskva-Leningrad, 1966. (27) A. N. Bernstam, ?

An attempt at interpreting all other stone sculptures as images of enemies does not stand the test of criticism ? (28). Having proposed various systems of classification, among others those (for the first time!) based on mathematical statistics, Ja. A. Ser distinguishes two types of these sculp? tures and comes to the important conclusion that they were connected with two different rites: one type with the commemoration of a particular person dead or fallen in battle, the other with a much more widespread cult of deified (or worshipped, obozestvlennyh) forefathers (29). Speaking of stone sculptures, it might be worth mentioning that as a result of my journey I was able to draw the attention of the experts to a relatively well preserved stone head (fig. 12) discovered, in 1956, on the territory of the Gun-nariyn somon (in the ?v?r Khangai aimak) (30). Its noble features seem to indicate that it might belong to the statue of a distinguished Turk. This head, which is worthy of comparison with that of K?l Tegin (unearthed some years later), also enriches our knowledge of the anthropological types of Turkish chiefs and nobles (31) and of the artistic value of the plastic production of mediae? val Turks as well. A stone figure which is reproduced hereafter (fig. 13) was, in 1961, also discovered in the central part of the country (near the Khublai Khan's fortress, cf. above) and is a typical example of plastic (not flat or contour) representation. It represents a person in a standing position whose legs are not visible whereas the arms, hands and fingers are clearly marked. The arrangement of the arms is quite typical: the right hand is bent upwards, the left one rests on a belt. The head is broken off, as is the rule with regard to human statues found in Mongolia, and a small depression below the neck forms a triangular decol letage. A belt, hanging loosely on the right side of the person, is distinctly marked, but only four of its links are visible. From an aesthetic point of view we could, perhaps, speak MIA, 26, p. 143.

Sprawozdania..., cit., p. 144; Ural-Altaische Jahrb?cher, cit., p. 172. Note. Having concluded the present remarks, in October 1969, I was much surprised at learning from the recently published paper by L. Jisl, ? Wie sahen die alten T?rken aus? ?, Ural-Altaische Jahrb?cher, 40, 3-4, 1968, p. 182, that a photograph of the head in question had been published earlier by him in Archeologicke rozhledy, XIII, 1961, fig. 56! L. Jisl calls it ?... der in Ugdzug bei Sant somon unweit des Flusses Ongin angetroffene Kopf... ? (p. 182) and reproduces it again on pi. IV, 3. In my reports I related the circumstances in which, according to my Mongolian informant, the head was found. They differ in at least one important point from those given by L. Jisl: ?Gun-nariyn somon? or ?Ugdzug bei Sant somon?? I am glad to read that we both agree in supposing that the head most probably represents one of the T?k?e chiefs. On the other hand, L. Jisl (and the Editorial Board of the Ural-Altaische Jahrb?cher as well) seem to be acquainted neither with my reports (in CAJ I discuss, among others, the problem of the head? gear of the statue) nor the anthropological analysis made by A. Wiercinski, ibid. Much to my regret, I am unable to take into consideration, in the present paper, the interesting suggestions made by L. Jisl in his most recent paper on the question. (31) A.

On account of this characteristic feature the statue could be classified, following the earlier, much contested, terminology, as of the ? Scythian type ? (32). It should be noticed, however, that the upper part of the supposed bowl is rather strangely shaped, in such a way that it is easy to discern another object or even a bird (33). But, before taking up this or any other hypothesis, one must be sure that the darker shade which is visible on the photograph is a genuine one and not the result of retouching made just before photographing the unearthed object. It should be added in this connection that some of the Mongolian conservators do not find anything wrong with the practice of ? embellishing ? these types of relics. In the pho? tograph (fig. 14) an interesting stone baba (forming part of the collection of the Central National Museum in Ulan Bator) is shown, bearing on its trunk a runic inscription. Before placing the baba on exhibition, its facial features had been emphasized with yellow and brown paint as is shown by comparison with its earlier photograph (34). Another stone baba, without being retouched this time, is shown in the following photograph (fig. 15). It is a primitive stone post resembling a human being, which is chiefly due to the incision made in order to mark the head from the trunk, the head consti? tuting, as is the rule for this type, one third of the whole. As for the facial features, there are only barely visible round eyes, placed on different levels, eye-brows and a nose. The strings or wires entwined round the trunk were probably used to excavate the block. It is to be supposed that the stones of various shapes and sizes which are visible on the left side of the photograph were piled up in recent times to place the statue in a vertical posi? tion and to protect it from falling again. To sum up, this is a baba of a common type, one of the thousands of pleasant stone figures which still lend glamour to the Eurasian steppes by their gloomy charm. This statue was discovered by Mongolian scholars in the valley of Ikh Teeliy, in Khair khan-dulan somon, in ?v?r-Khangai aimak. Sculptures of Animals This group of plastic representations usually stands apart, but in some aspects it should be treated in common with grave complexes on the one hand and, to a certain extent, also with petroglyphic images on the other. Here we find mainly representations of rams, carnivores resembling lions or tigers, and also turtles. These sculptures of varying artistic (32) ?

It is evident that these images have a symbolic and not merely an aesthetic value, but we seem to be still far from learning all the shades of that symbolism. The question of the turtles which are a Chinese cultural import is rela? tively simple. In China, they have been known for centuries and have played an important religious role (35). Their stone representations were used as pedestals for stelae bearing imperial decrees. It was probably in this last role that they were adopted by neighbouring nomadic tribes. Though one could not convincingly contest the hypothesis that some no? madic tribes used to worship turtles in very remote times, it is generally agreed that the production of such representations for the bases of stelae was only known to the Orkhon Turks, namely, from the time when famous memorials to K?l Tegin and Bilge Kagan were erected by order of the Emperor of China and with the help of Chinese craftsmen. It is easy to suppose not only that there was a tendency to imitate this form of monument among the Turks of that time, but also that this tendency must have been naturally limi? ted. It is interesting to observe that in spite of the devastation of the Ongin Monument its stone turtle has survived up to the present day (fig. 16). It now looks poor and primitive which can be only partially due to deterioration caused by external influences. Since this time we have no record mentioning any help by Chinese masons, we may guess that this construction was an imitation and that the turtle was cut by Turkish artisans. A stone object which is reproduced hereafter (fig. 17) belongs to the Memorial of K?l Tegin. Not only the general shape, but also the transverse cutting with a border seem to suggest that it is a stone turtle. However, L. Jisl mentions in his report only one stone turtle, measuring 2.25 m., which is shown represented in the inserted photograph. It is evident that our turtle-like object cannot be identical with the one in L. Jisl's photo graph (36). The tradition of carving stone turtles must have survived in the following centuries, too, but it seems that it was kept alive more in China than in the neighbouring territories. As has already been pointed out, marvellously preserved stone turtles can still be admired in the ruins of Karakorum (fig. 7). A nice, but probably standard, stylization and the preci? se elaboration of details reveals the skilful hand of a gifted Chinese artisan. A rather frequent feature of grave ensembles in Mongolia is the representation of rams. It is not yet quite clear whether they belong exclusively to the Orkhon Turks or (35) The following are A. Heikel's remarks made in connection with a stone turtle standing in the vicinity of the Erdene Dzuu monastery: ? Le seul objet interessant, qui y est reste des temps pas? ses, est une tortue de pierre (tab. 64). Les cailloux qu'elle a sur son dos, y ont probablement ete places par des Mongols, en temoignage de leur venera? tion. Cette image sculptee parait devoir son origine ? des motifs religieux. Car en Chine, dans les an ciens temps, pour chaque entreprise quelle qu'elle f?t les ministres et les hauts fonctionnaires allaient consulter la tor tue comme un oracle. Chez les peuplades de l'Asie Orientale il existait de meme des recks mystiques, dans lesquels il etait parle de poissons et de tortues qui auraient forme des ponts sur les rivieres (Jakinf, Istorija etc. II, 99, 109 note 1, III, 81 etc.)? (Heikel in Inscriptions..., cit., p. XIII). (36) Jisl, ? Vorbericht... ?, cit., pp. 67, 69, pi. Ill, fig. 2. Cf. also Radloff, Atlas..., cit., pi. VII, fig. 3. 130</page><page sequence="20">to some other Turkish tribes or even to some non-Turkish peoples. It seems fairly easy to point out the reason why these images were placed on the graves or in their immediate vicinity if one considers the fundamental part played by those animals in the everyday life of the nomads. No wonder, therefore, that they accompany their owners also after their death. But it is equally probable that in this area the image of a ram might also contain some more symbolic meaning such as tranquillity, peace, affluence etc. The images of rams which are reproduced here (figs. 18, 19) belong to the Ongin Monument. Two sculptures of rams actually placed in front of the main group of the same Monument (one of which can be seen in the following photograph, fig. 20) have been reproduced and described elsewhere (37). All these sculptures are deprived of heads, so it is interesting to know that a fine statue of a ram with a head has been discovered in or near the ruins of Siwet-ulan (38). In some regions of Urianghai J. G. Grati? had the occasion to observe, along with rams, sculptures of other animals resembling lions and tigers. One of these sculptures was more a fantastic being than a living creature (39). A representation of a lion with an open mouth, sitting on its hind legs, was recently published by P. Aalto (40). The sculpture was discovered in Siwet-ul?n and photographed by C. Dordzsuren. But also in this case we cannot know whether we have an independent product of the Turks, symbolizing power or bravery (appropriate Turkish words: aslan, ? lion ?, and qaplan, ? tiger ? are generally known to all Turks and were already used as proper names in the most remote times or, more probably, the culture loan of a symbolic representation that has been popu? lar since time immemorial in China and in countries of the ancient Near East such as As? syria, Babylon, Persia, Egypt and others (41). Representations of Objects and Objects Made of Stone Plastic representations of some objects of common use not in fact numerous, constitute a separate group, notwithstanding the fact that they are often closely connected with images (37) They are visible in the photographs repro? duced in Ural-Altaische Jahrb?cher, figs. 11 and 13.

Les lions ont ainsi joue un role important dans la decoration de tous ces monuments et des places qu'ils occupaient. Ce fait s'accorde tout particulierement avec rornamentation architecturale dans PAsie centrale, lorsqu'il s'agissait de representer la puissance des princes et des Dieux. II est p. ex. raconte dans les chroniques chinoises, que les chefs des Koutches et des Boses etaient assis sur des tr?nes figurant des lions d'or. La tete du prince de Kachgar etait meme couverte d'un chapeau ayant la forme d'un lion d'or. II est vrai qu'il y avait aussi des trones Supportes par des chevaux ou des moutons...

Thus on many babas belts, knives, daggers, swords, purses, flint stones, bowls, probably toilet-sets and other objects are visible. They should be distinguished from similar free-standing objects made of stone, such as mortars (42) or offering stones. An offering stone belonging to the ensemble of the Memorial to Bilge Kagan was reproduced by W. Radloff (43) and A. Heikel (44). It is still in a good state of preservation. Carefully cut in grey stone, it is a regular cube measuring 240 cm. a side. In the upper surface of the cube, there is a round hole of 85 cm. in diameter, encircled with a prominent edge. Owing to its great mass, this stone is probably the only object of that ruined ensemble which stands in its original place. It would not however, have anything to do with the offering stone of the Memorial to K?l Tegin which has been dug out and shifted by the Czechoslovak Mongolian expedition. As far as I know, investigations of the last decades shed but little fresh light on the problem of sacrificial rites of the Ancient Turks (45). One of the human representations of the Ongin Monument (fig. 20) holds a large cylindrical object between its knees (fig. 21) which I have been unable to identify. Its relatively large dimension in comparison with the seated person and its unconventional shape, now make me think of a vessel, probably a mortar. The existence of stone repre? sentations of vessels in eastern Khangai has been reported by J. G. Gran? (46), but there have probably been few attempts at explaining the purpose of placing them or elucidating their presumed symbolic value. One might guess that the image of a person grinding grain symbolized satiety and abundance ? the elements of a happy life here and beyond as wished for the dead by his relatives. Another guess is that a mortar could be an attribute of a house? wife but, unfortunately, we know little about the division of housework between men and women amongst the Orkhon Turks. (It is most probable, however, that women of the T?k?e did husbandry, especially in the periods when the men were away on raids etc.) (47). It is worth mentioning the items of clothing worn by the Ancient Turks and other peoples as reproduced on the statues. There is no need to emphasize the value of a profounder know? ledge of these elements. Special attention has already been given by W. Radloff and other scholars to the remarkable fashion of the attire of Bilge Kagan and his wife's statues, but one can be still surprised at the modern cut of the lapels (figs. 22, 23) (48). An interesting detail of dress has survived on one of the recumbent statues of the memorial to K?l Tegin (fig. 24) (49). According to A. Heikel's opinion it is a silk scarf (khadak) used by the Mongo? lian buddhists to wrap presents for offering (50). (42) Cf. Gran?, op. cit., p. 51. (43) Radloff, op. cit., pi. X, fig. 2.

It may be compared with that worn by a person represented in one of the statues from Siwet-ul?n (52). Petroglyphic Images Petroglyphic representations constitute very interesting archaeological relics in Mongolia, Siberia, Kirgizia and some other Asian territories. The attention of many travellers has been caught by them since time immemorial, but their scientific study started relatively late. Their existence was announced by expeditions in Siberia and Mongolia and the active part in pre? senting them was played by Finnish and Russiaq scholars. But the explorers of that period were fascinated by the much greater discoveries they had made, and did not give the problem the emphasis it deserves. This state of affairs has continued almost up to the present time and a new approach to the question is entirely due to Soviet scholars: A. P. Okladnikov (53), A. D. Grac (54) and some others. Quite recently a certain interest in petroglyphs was also roused in Mongolian scholars who, in the course of their research trips have many occasions to locate agglomerations of these images, take their photographs and make copies (55). The stage of methodological study has not, however, come till now. They are placed on stone pillars, mostly, however, on rocky mountain-sides, slopes, in the mouths of valleys, in mountain-passes etc. They are small pictures, usually several centi? metres in size, carved or scratched on a stone surface by means of a sharp-edged tool. Some of them are nothing but family or property signs (tamyas), others represent images of human beings (also shamans) and animals produced by drawing their outlines or scratching, not deeply, the whole silhouette. Stags, goats, saigas, rams, horses, camels, dogs, running or rid? ing men are their main subjects repeated with some variations again and again. It is generally known that many of them date from very remote epochs (56) and pertain to different peo? ples who had lived in this area and that they present specimens of the spontaneous artistic activity of man from probably the neolithic to the bronze ages and through the mediaeval period up to present day. There is no doubt that many of them are merely copies of earlier models, standard mass-products of shepherds not necessarily gifted by nature with (51) On more details, see Tryjarski, ?

(in Russian olennye kamni) are generally dated back to the 1st millenium B. C. There is, however, no agreed opinion on their more precise dating. Thus, for instance, K. V. Vjatkina (op. cit., p. 94, note 6) writes about ? the middle and the end of that mil? lenium ?, whereas Bol'saja Sovetskaja Enciklopedi ja (2nd ed., vol. 28, p. 307) points to ? the period from the 7th to the 3rd cent. [B.C.] ?. 133</page><page sequence="23">artistic talents, but often bored with only their flocks for company. However, it is equally true that, apart from their artistic value, they are, at the same time, a precious source of infor? mation on the mentality, rites and customs of their authors. Therefore it is to be regretted that whereas the paleolithic images in France, Spain, Switzerland or those in the Sahara caves have already received hundreds of studies, editions and monographs, so many interesting objects of a similar kind of art, and discovered for science at almost the same period, have not even been catalogued yet. This seems to reflect discredit on all the institutions con? cerned, which have been established for the protection of objects of art and culture all over the world. During my trip I visited a remarkable agglomeration of these images at the mountain pass called Bichigt Khotol, discovered by W. Radloff's expedition. I have already pub? lished some examples of this primitive art (57). The petroglyphic images are scattered all over the country and J. G. Gran? has also located their agglomerations in Urian ghai and Altai (58). The existence of quite a mass of these images in the vicinity of Ar vaikher (the centre of ?v?r-Khangai aimak) has been recently reported by some Mon? golian scholars (5*). The image which I reproduce here (fig. 25) was discovered in the same aimak at Ikhe Tevshi, near the centre of the Khovdo somon. The picture scratched on a stone block represents figures of a man and of two animals, probably a horse and a dog, instinct with life and motion. According to the kind information of Academician Rinchen and Director Namkhaidagva, in that region there are thousands of petroglyphic images. Inscriptions on Stones Engraved, scratched or painted on stone blocks, rocks and stelae, funeral, commemo? rative or simple informative inscriptions in many languages, but chiefly in T?rk? and Uighur, are generally known and appreciated. Since they constitute a very vast topic they can be only touched on here cursorily. It is worth mentioning, however, that my quasi expedition was quite fruitful in results so far as inscriptions are concerned. A detailed ex? amination of five very famous runic inscriptions, new squeezes and photographs have made quite a solid basis for new editions. One of these revised editions, viz. that of the inscrip? tion from Ikhe Khushotu Monument (fig. 26) has already been produced (60). Besides, an editio princeps of a short much dommaged grave inscription from Arkhanen was also pub? lished (61). Some other runic inscriptions such as that on the stone baba from the Central National Museum in Ulan Bator still await their turn.

To sum up, scholars working abroad are not sufficiently informed about the distribu? tion and actual state of preservation of archaeological relics in Mongolia, not to mention the scientifical analysis of many of them, all in spite of the efforts of Mongolian scholars to change this state of affairs. In fact, we still have only antiquated and incomplete maps such as that made many decades ago by J. G. Gran? for Khangai or the much more recent one, by V. A. Obrucev for eastern Mongolia. The publication of a serious archaeological atlas of that country is still to be desired. All this is especially relevant so far as Turkish relics are concerned, many of which have been neither catalogued nor systema? tically studied. As I have reported elsewhere, many of them have met with rough usage by time and people as is evidenced by the broken stelae of the Ongin Monument and that of the Memorial to Bilge Kagan or the dismounted sarcophagus of the Memorial to Tonyukuk. There are some important fragments of the inscription belonging to the stele of the Me? morial to K?l Tegin, discovered a couple of years ago, which have never been pub? lished (63). It is to be feared that they have been left without proper protection and may become irrevocably lost. Many precious objects discovered years ago are left in the open air and deteriorate subsequently. The authorities have shown their good intentions by having protective roofs constructed over some of the inscribed stelae (as was done many decades ago), but those were soon destroyed by the local population. About a year ago a group of tourists covered some inscriptions on the famous block at Khoitu Tamir (Taikhyr Chuluu) with their own paintings (64). It is difficult to overestimate the extent of the loss suffered by science in this as in similar cases. The difficulties connected with protecting archaeological objects are generally known all over the world. It is evident, however, that the international organisations for protect? ing cultural values which continue to exclude archaeological relics in vast areas of Mongo? lian steppes from their activity and help do not serve the development of science and uni? versal culture well.

Ser-odzav about a new remarkable grave complex dating from the Turkish period and discovered in the Arkhangai aimak. This monument had been transported to the capital and displayed in an exhibition organized for the members of the Congress. It consists of a stone turtle, measuring some 1.20 m. and a stone stele, some 2.50 m. high, actually broken into three pieces. The stele is covered with lines of runic script on all its four sides and most probably commemorates the deeds of an unknown Turkish kagan. The Turkologists of all the world await with utmost interest the publication of this inscription. (64) This wanton act was publicly discussed (in a daily Unen) and severely censured. According to S. G. Kljastornyj, who examined 25 Turkish inscrip? tions on that block in 1969, their state of preser? vation is bad. 135</page></plain_text>
