<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STRUCTURE AND CAUSATION OF MOHAVE WARFARE GEORGE H. FATHAUER THE YUMAN TRIBES of the lower Colorado River long have been re- garded as warlike, nationalistic peoples. The Mohave clearly manifested these characteristics. Virtually all students of the Mohave, including the early explorers, testify either directly or indirectly to the existence of tribal organization and a strong sense of tribal unity among these people. Kroeber states that the Mohave thought of themselves as a national entity, a conception quite different from the village solidarity which characterized most of California.' Devereux also notes the "earnest and intense national feeling of the Mohave."2 Early explorers indicate that this nationalistic tribal organization existed prior to White contact. Mohave tribal organization was based upon a number of factors such as lan- guage, territory, mythology, ceremonial organization, clan beliefs, and external relations. Warfare, which falls in the last category, had its form determined in large part by the tribal organization; but it was, at the same time, one of the factors producing and maintaining this organization. The warlike proclivities of the Yuman tribes, especially the Mohave, have been noted by several writers. Kroeber, for example, says ". . . the petty Cali- fornian feuds of locality and inherited revenge have given way among the Mo- have to a military spirit, under which the tribe acted as a unit in offensive and defensive enterprise."'3 Castetter and Bell say that war ". . . was a characteristic feature of River Yuman culture which provided their nationalistic sense its most concrete expression; actually for them it was a nationalized sport."' Stewart has recently provided an excellent description of Mohave warfare.' It is the purpose of this paper to supplement Stewart's report, to elaborate upon the connections between warfare and other aspects of the culture, and to consider the causes of warfare in this society. 1 A.

Their chief enemies were the Maricopa, Cocopa, and Halchidhoma. Occasional fighting was carried on against the Ute, Paiute, Northern Chemehuevi, Dieguefio, Pima, Kohuana, and Apache. Friendly relations were generally maintained with the Walapai, Havasupai, and Yavapai. When warfare was imminent, the braves (k"anami), who were scattered throughout the valley, became important tribal officials. The scalper (axwe satumac), the major war leader, always accompanied large war parties. Guiding the expeditions were the spies (matevawe). The custodian of the scalps (kwaxot) was the major religious official. He did not go on the warpath but presided at the victory celebrations and cared for the scalps and female prisoners brought back by the warriors. Before engaging in warfare these officials held a conference in which they also solicited the opinions of some of the wise old men of the tribe. Once the decision to go to war was made, the spies suggested the best route for the expedition. Then runners were dispatched to all parts of the valley to tell the men to assemble at a particular place and time, usually in late October or early November after the harvest. Ordinarily the men came to the southern part of the valley accompanied by their families, who sang funeral songs since their loved ones might not return. The war party then left the valley and travelled toward the enemy, following the route prescribed by the spies who constantly scouted ahead and along the line of march. Each warrior carried a small supply of food and water which was expected to last for several days. After the departure of the warriors, the custodian of the scalps informed the chief (xanidal), who had theoretically ignored all preparations for war. The chief then urged the people to watch for omens concerning the success or failure of the expedition. If a star fell in the direction the party had taken, it meant a victory; if it fell in the opposite direction, it meant defeat. Individuals also watched for omens indicating death to their loved ones: dreaming of an owl, for example, meant the death of a relative. If the expedition encountered a small group of the enemy, a spy rushed in to touch an opponent with one of the feathered poles which functioned as standards in Mohave warfare. Following this, one of the clubbers killed the foe. Sometimes a party was satisfied with destroying a small number of the enemy. At other times, the initial killings merely announced the arrival of the Mohave party in the enemy's territory. Then preparations for battle were made. The spies frequently performed feats of bravery in their search for information about the strength of the enemy during the night before the main battle. In-</page><page sequence="3">MOHAVE WARFARE 99 formants said that spies sometimes invaded the camp of the enemy, even going inside their houses in the darkness, leaving again at sunrise with their hair hang- ing in strands in front of their faces to prevent recognition. In addition to the spies, the Mohave army was divided into a large number of bowmen and clubbers. The latter were the braves, equipped with great war clubs which they used to smash heads or faces of the enemy. The clubbers formed the center of the Mohave line. The bowmen, who were not braves but "common people" since they had not dreamed special war power, laid down a barrage of arrows from the flanks while the clubbers advanced upon the enemy in the center. The men on the flanks attempted to surround the enemy so that as many as possible could be eliminated. The scalper directed the fighting from the rear. The clubbers did most of the obvious damage since several arrow wounds were usually required to kill a person. Hence, the clubbers were usually the only men who could claim individually to have killed an enemy. Stories and old accounts say that the Mohave demonstrated great courage and a strong will to fight until a decision had been reached. The conclusion of the battle found the victorious army in possession of the field, and the scalper then scalped several dead enemies. A few young females were sometimes taken as prisoners to be placed under the care of the scalper on the return journey. On the way back to the home valley, the scalper "tamed" the scalps and kneaded them to make them pliable. Runners were dispatched to the custodian of the scalps so that preparations for the scalp dance might be started. The kwaxot notified the other members of the tribe and a great feast was prepared near his house. When the party reached the valley, the scalper turned the scalps and prisoners over to the kwxot, who was their custodian from that time on. Then the people placed white clay on their hair and the dancing began. The rest of the day was devoted to dancing, singing, shouting, and feasting. The members of the war party and their wives fasted for four days but were not barred from the dancing and singing. The next morning all the singers gathered in a circle. The kwaxot placed the scalps on a pole which was given to a woman called, in honor of the occasion, the yakatha'alya, who danced with them, imitating the scalping and the acts of battle and poking fun at able-bodied young men who had not gone on the warpath. At certain junctures in the dancing, the scalps were raised high in the air and all the people shouted and threw dust on them. This was done eight times to the accompaniment of different songs. During the feasting the people threw corn and beans to the scalps. Following this the kwaxot placed the scalps in a large olla for safekeeping.</page><page sequence="4">100 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY He then addressed the throng, urging the young people to marry and have lots of children so that the tribe would grow. It was expected that the people would enjoy themselves sexually during the four days of the celebration. During the ceremony a family having a virgin daughter-a rare occurrence even among very young girls-sometimes gave her in marriage to one of the braves, especially one who had just proved his power by killing an enemy. The female captives were given by the kwaxot to old men who did not have wives. Young and middle-aged men were afraid to marry these women because of the "enemy sickness" that they brought with them, but the old men were anxious to have them since the sickness had little dread for those who did not expect to live long under the best of cir- cumstances. The kwaxot kept the scalps, examining them periodically and wash- ing their hair with mud whenever necessary. Each time they were washed, the entire tribe gathered for a celebration similar to the one just described. One informant stated that the washing of the scalps was an annual event, but others maintained that the condition of the scalps and the wishes of the kwaxot were the factors determining the intervals between these celebrations. The tribal military organization also had a defensive aspect. The spies con- stantly maintained a vigil to prevent surprise attacks. At all tribal gatherings, such as mourning ceremonies or harvest feasts, the spies went out and guarded all water holes and trails leading to the area. If an enemy succeeded in pene- trating the valley and killed a member of the tribe, the nearest kWanami notified the other braves through a system of runners and then set out in pursuit. The other warriors joined the hunt as soon as possible and sometimes caught the invaders before they were able to get out of the territory. At a somewhat later date, the horse was adapted to this defense warning system. No mention of this system has appeared in the literature but the evidence for its existence seems to be fairly good. The Mohave had few horses before the influx of White settlers, but some of them were used as part of an organized defense system. There were four horses, located in various parts of the valley, which were kept ready for emergency use at all times. They were well-trained, well-fed, and not used for any other purpose. As an informant phrased it, "These horses guarded the whole valley." In case of enemy attack, a brave or one of the spies rode to other parts of the valley to warn the entire tribe of the danger and to call the men together. The message was relayed the entire length of the valley by means of the four horses. These horses were also used to carry notice of a death to distant relatives. The names of the first horses used in this manner, in order of their location from north to</page><page sequence="5">MOHAVE WARFARE 101 south, are said to have been axat akwere (horse, red paint), axat uce (horse, char- coal), axat katel (horse, swaybacked), and nvapo kwi6uye (colored eye). Some indirect confirmation of this pattern may be found in a report of one of the early White visitors to the valley. The valley of this river must be thickly peopled, for on both shores, as far as we could see, appeared these signs of human habitation. We had not ridden far in this plain, when two Indians mounted on magnificent stallions, came galloping towards us, and we were even more struck by the beauty of these evidently well-kept steeds, perfect models of horses as they were, than by that of the young riders who guided them merely with a hair cord. With the exception of these two, we never saw but one horse during our stay on the Colorado, and all three seemed to be regarded rather in the light of things sacred than as intended for use. They were petted and fed by everyone who came near them, so that it was no wonder if they appeared in good condition; and when I tried to persuade the Indians to sell me one, they only laughed at me, and overwhelmed their darlings with caresses. The horses were young, but appeared to have belonged to this nation from their infancy." This description is, indirectly at least, in accord with the pattern described by informants. Strangers visiting the valley would have been scouted by the spies and braves using the specially trained horses kept available for this purpose. In summary, it appears that Mohave warfare, both offensively and defensively, was characterized by rather detailed organization and was tribal in scope. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF WARFARE The previous description has indicated the statuses in Mohave social structure which were most directly concerned with warfare, namely, brave, scalper, and custodian of the scalps. These statuses may now be described in greater detail together with the methods by which they were occupied. According to Mohave theory, all special talents or abilities were derived from the creators by dreaming. Dream experiences were not actively sought but came automatically to certain individuals in each generation. The importance of dreaming was adequately stated years ago: Dreams ... are the foundation of Mohave life; and dreams throughout are cast in mythological mold. There is no people whose activities are more shaped by this psychic state, or what they believe to be such, and none whose civilization is so com- pletely, so deliberately reflected in their myths.7 6 B. M6llhausen, Diary of a Journey from the Mississippi to the Coasts of the Pacific (London, 1858), vol. 2, p. 254. 7 Kroeber, Handbook, p. 755.</page><page sequence="6">102 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY A future k'anami, or brave, experienced a power-dream early in his boyhood, or sometimes allegedly before birth. As with all Mohave power-dreams, there was a strong mythological component. The future kwanami dreamed of a test that occurred after the death of the Great Spirit, Matavilt, at a place somewhat north of Parker. At this time, "there were no people but the people were birds." Cactus plants were set in line and a test was held to see which bird could pick them up in the shortest time. The chicken-hawk won the contest and was honored as kwanami. To quote one informant: "The chicken-hawk is the bravest and quickest of all the birds and humans. He doesn't give up when he is sent out- he kills people by attacking them when they are blinded by the sun. Any man who can see this by dreaming will be a kwanami." In the creation myth recorded by Kroeber, Mastamxo, the successor to Matavily, decreed that several species of hawks were to be concerned with warfare, and instructed them in the art of battle.8 Certain boys dreamed of these mythological incidents, and of chicken- hawks and chicken-hawk feathers. These dreams gave them the power to become braves. The people were able to recognize a future k"anami by his behavior. He was a brave, aggressive boy. When a child was punished by such methods as being poked on the forehead with a finger nail or jabbed with a hot stick, the oldsters- would regard his reactions as an indication of his powers. A future kwanami would never cry nor would he change the disapproved behavior. Nor was he fond of playing farmer or hunter with the other boys, but frequently went off alone to make bows and arrows and hunt for chicken-hawks. The future braves hardened their bodies by running and staying out of doors in all kinds of weather. On the basis of these characteristic behavior traits it was usually possible for the people to recognize a potential brave. The Mohave attitude was that a boy behaved in this way because he had experienced a particular power-dream rather than that a boy with aggressive tendencies would probably make a good warrior. The older people commented upon the behavior of the children, discussing their probable future activities. It is not surprising, then, that a boy regarded by his relatives as destined to be a warrior would taken an interest in the activities of warfare, would gradually come to pattern his behavior according to cultural expectations, and would actually experience the prescribed dreams. Devereux has described a similar process for Mohave shamans." During adolescence the power-dreams recurred, and a young brave began to 8 A. L.

He increased his training and began to paint a black stripe across his face and to wear two chicken-hawk feathers in his hair. Finally, when a war expedition was formed, the leaders allowed the young brave to go. On his first war party, the young man stayed in the middle of the line watching for the chance to kill an enemy or to rush into the fray to pick up one of the feather poles which had been dropped. If he succeeded in killing an enemy, his status was confirmed; from this time on he was recognized as a full-fledged brave, an important person in the tribe. According to Mohave theory, the killing of an enemy did not make a person a brave but merely confirmed the power-dreams which destined him to prowess in war. Various informants offered somewhat contradictory accounts of the behavior of young braves. Some maintained that they were quite "mean," but not in exactly the same way as shamans. The obstreperousness of shamans, involving scatalogical and sexual elements, has been described in several papers by Deve- reux.10 The following examples of the braves' "mean" behavior were given by informants. When it was cold and the people of the household were gathering wood for a fire, the kwanami did not help, saying that he could endure the cold without fire. When staying at someone else's house, a brave sometimes removed the cover from the door so that it became very cold inside. If a brave encountered some boys who had a fire going, he would throw water on it. A brave might kick dirt into the water supply of a household. Braves frequently got into fights at dances and ceremonies by throwing sand on someone who was not dancing very well. The people believed that because of his dreams such a man could not help acting in this way, and they felt that he would improve his behavior as he got older and had considerable war experience. Other informants contradicted this picture by contending that young braves were well-behaved and quiet "because they knew they were going to die." Both groups of informants agreed upon the braves' courage and ability to withstand pain. This discrepancy in the accounts given by different informants may be due to misunderstandings which are difficult to clear up because the warfare pattern has not been directly observed by people living today. The informants who said the braves "acted mean" maintained that this behavior ended after they had been on several war parties. Those informants who said the braves were "quiet" may not have been as precise in their account, thus overlooking this transitory period. A second possibility is that the informants may not have had the same 10 G. Devereux, Sexual Life of the Mohave Indians (Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, 1935); idem, L'envoutement chez les Indiens Mohave (Journal, Societe des Ameri- canistes de Paris, vol. 29, pp. 405-412, 1937).</page><page sequence="8">104 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY idea of what constituted mean and obstreperous behavior. Those who denied "meanness" may have been intent upon differentiating the braves from shamans, whose behavior involved extremely obstreperous elements. Since the braves some- times killed evil shamans who had bewitched people, they represented the forces of good which were opposed to the shamans. Thus the milder "meanness" of the braves might well have been ignored by some informants. As a matter of fact there were several points of similarity between shamans and braves. Both showed institutionalized suicidal tendencies. Kroeber describes the behavior of shamans and braves as follows: Doctors are despatched for blighting the crops; for repeatedly attending a patient but killing instead of curing him; for having said about a sick person: "I wish you would die"; and for admitting responsibility for deaths. There is a doctor now who stands at funerals and says aloud: "I killed him." Doctors and brave men are alike. The latter say: "I do not wish to live long." A doctor says: "I shall not live a long time. I wish to die. That is why I kill people. Why do you not kill me?" Or he may hand a stick to a man and say: "I killed your father." Or he may come and tell a sick person: "Don't you know that it is I that am killing you? Must I grasp you and despatch you with my hands before you will try to kill me?"" Both shamans and braves also received special treatment in the afterworld, a belief related to suicidal tendencies. When dead, people went to the afterworld and then underwent several metamorphoses, eventually winding up as charcoal on the desert. He [a shaman] segregates these dead souls [whom he has bewitched] "in his place," their souls visiting him at night and, if of the suitable sex, having intercourse with him (or her). Eventually he will come to fear that another witch may kidnap his retinue of souls, and/or he will long for their constant presence. As a result he will taunt the relatives of his victims, by confessing to witchcraft, whereupon the witch is killed. It must be stated that a witch only kills those whom he loves, except when acting as a paid agent of someone who wishes to put a personal enemy out of the way.12 Braves went to a separate place in the afterworld, located on the desert, where, as one informant phrased it, "they live always preparing to go to war--they make dust day and night." Informants also said that men killed in battle by the enemy went to a separate place (probably the place already mentioned, since only braves engaged in the hand-to-hand combat that was likely to result in death). A brave who had lost a well-loved relative or friend in war went on the revenge party and frequently exposed himself to great danger, performing unusual deeds of 11 Kroeber, Handbook, p. 778. 12 G. Devereux, Primitive Psychiatry (Bulletin of the History of Medicine, vol. 11, pp. 522-542, 1942), p. 530. Brackets mine.</page><page sequence="9">MOHAVE WARFARE 105 heroism. The brave knew that death in battle meant reunion with the beloved friend or relative in the special place set aside in the afterworld. If his death were too long delayed, the relative might have metamorphosed into the next stage, thus making a reunion in the afterworld impossible. This seems to indicate that people who dreamed strong powers connected with violence, witchcraft, or warfare were different from ordinary people. With regard to the discrepancy over the behavior of young braves, this material suggests that those informants who said that braves were "mean" were correct. However, their "meanness" was milder and did not last as long as that of shamans. All informants agreed upon the "goodness" of old braves who were no longer able to go to war. The retired braves travelled around a great deal, helping people and giving advice to the younger men. If a woman could not take care of her family because of illness, an old brave would go and cook for the household. Cooking was defined as a female activity, but these old and respected warriors were willing to undertake this menial task. The old braves also acted as peace- makers in neighborhood quarrels or in the event of dissension between husband and wife. One informant described an old kwanami interrupting a husband who was beating his wife severely by saying "if you want to fight, you better pick on me--come on, I will fight you." This made the husband ashamed so that he stopped punishing the woman. All informants agreed that the behavior of a retired k'anami was exceptionally good and kind. If those informants who main- tained that a brave acted "mean" when he was young are correct, the extreme "goodness" of old braves climaxed a remarkable change in personality char- acteristics. Linton has described a somewhat similar change in the behavior of Comanche warriors.13 The status of spy (matevawe) also required an early power-dream. Under the stimulus of this dream certain young men spent a great deal of time acquiring a detailed knowledge of the country and increasing their ability to see in the dark and to run long distances. Apparently the temperamental characteristics of boys destined to be spies were not as distinctive as those for braves, because the people could not tell a future spy until adolescence when he began to train himself for this position. The Mohave apparently expected a spy's son to follow in his father's footsteps. Sons were in the best position to learn the detailed knowledge of the country from their fathers; but if they did not have the proper power-dream, their knowledge was of no avail. They felt, however, that the son would probably have the right dream. As a young adult, the spy began to talk with the other occupants of this status. When a war expedition was contemplated, 13 R. Linton, The Study of Man (New York and London, 1936), pp. 120-121.</page><page sequence="10">106 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY he volunteered to undertake the duties of spy. Then the people knew that he had dreamed correctly and was prepared to fill the position. The spies carried a small pipe and a pole decorated with white feathers. While evidence was ex- tremely fragmentary on this point, some informants felt that the spy could locate water holes and the enemy by means of this pole.14 The spies, who were regarded as very brave, were highly respected members of the tribe. No marked behavioral change was attributed to the spies in old age, but they were respected and their advice was accepted by the younger men actively engaged in warfare. The statuses of scalper (axwe satumac) and custodian of the scalps (kwaxot), unlike those described above, were not exclusively limited to warfare, but related the war patterns to other aspects of Mohave life. The scalper, who was the leader of large expeditions, was also a shaman (k"athi6e) who possessed the power to cure the "enemy sickness" which resulted from close contact with foreigners, and which pervaded the scalps until he began the process of "taming" them.15 The concept of "enemy sickness" reveals much about Mohave feelings of tribal solidarity. Their beliefs concerning tribal affiliation expressed a kind of "racist" philosophy. All members of the tribe were "one folk" for whom purity of the blood was always an important consideration. They had a strong interest in "increasing the tribe," thus perpetuating their connection with the creators and insuring the continued existence of a desirable way of life. As Devereux explains, "The Mohave assume that every other tribe or race has a stronger blood than their own. . .. 16 Any intimate contact will produce the dreaded disease. The scalper was also in charge of the mourning ceremonies held for braves and other important tribal officials. In this capacity he spoke in the "spirit lan- guage," being called axwe cukwarakwi kusuman", and cured people who fainted during the ceremony or violated the taboos in connection with it. The connection of the scalper with the mourning ceremony is made clearer when it is realized that the ceremony itself consisted largely of a ritual enactment of warfare.17 The shamanistic aspect of the scalper needs some comment at this point. In- formants referred to him both as "doctor" and "war leader." His curative powers 14 Stewart, Mohave Warfare, p. 268. Stewart indicates that the rattlesnake doctor was the person who could locate water. 15 Idem, pp. 261-269. Stewart does not regard the scalper as the war leader. My informants called him "the leader of the kiwanami." His position as director of the mourning ceremony seems to fit with this interpretation. Small raiding parties were sometimes under the leadership of a brave since the scalper did not go on all war parties, but large tribal forays were under his direction. This may partially account for the disagreement among informants. 16 Devereux, Sexual Life of the Mohave Indians, p. 81. 17 K. M.

The symptoms of the disease were fainting or "crazy" behavior. Mohave shamans ordinarily practiced witchcraft, having the power for either good or evil over a particular disease. Most informants said that the scalper did not bewitch people, even though he was a shaman. A minority opinion, however, held that he occa- sionally practiced witchcraft. In this connection, the suggestion offered in a previous paper concerning the connection between the "ghost doctor" (nyav6i sumac) and scalper may be relevant.s8 It seems possible that the scalper some- times also dreamed the power necessary to be a ghost doctor, thus accounting for his occasional practice of witchcraft. The connection between the ghost doctor and the scalper is in need of further clarification. The scalper was also said to have possessed certain powers to raise clouds of dust or to bring rain which were sometimes used against the enemy on war expe- ditions. Kroeber describes this power in the creation myth wherein Mastamxo said: "When you speak there will be wind and rain and dust. I want you to tell about fighting: I want you to direct war."19 The scalper did not manifest any particularly distinctive characteristics in childhood, behaving like other boys who had dreamed strong power. He did not assume the status of scalper until about middle age, because the power of the "enemy sickness" would have shortened his life had he started to use his powers as a young man. As an old man, no longer able to go on the warpath, he retired and was succeeded by a man who had dreamed appropriately. The retired scalper gave advice on war matters and was highly respected. He was said to have be- haved in a helpful, friendly, generous manner. In summary, the major war leader was a man who had dreamed the power to cure "enemy sickness," to take and "tame" scalps, and to direct the mourning ceremonies held in honor of braves. The power to function as kwaxot, custodian of the scalps and the principal tribal religious leader, came in a dream shortly after birth. In the imitation of the adult world enacted by children, a boy who was to be k"axot was usually a leader. Such a boy acted quietly and appeared mature for his age. During adoles- cence he watched the techniques of the kwaxot closely and sometimes told him of his dreams. A man did not undertake the duties of this status until he was at least middle-aged. It was felt that a man assuming the status of custodian of the scalps while still young would have his life shortened because of the "enemy 18 G.

As pointed out in the description of the warfare pattern, the custodian of the scalps constantly lectured the people, urging them to be "good" and to think of the welfare of the tribe. He also urged the young people to have many children so that the tribe would be perpetuated. After the death of a k"axot, all the scalps that had been in his possession were de- stroyed. On the fourth day after his death, the yakatha'alya decorated themselves (there were usually two) with paint and feathers. Then, with two old men leading the way, they walked about the area singing of the scalps. After this had been done four times, the old men took the scalps and carried them into the river. A full understanding of the symbolism of the scalps has not appeared in published reports on the Mohave. The writer is not completely satisfied with the data he obtained in the field, but certain aspects of the problem have been clari- fied. The scalps were dangerous to ordinary people since they were permeated with the "enemy sickness" and only individuals who had dreamed special powers could deal with them. The scalps were felt to bring good luck and power to the younger generation, and their display was attended by considerable euphoria and intensified courting activities. There was a strong ritual connection between the scalps and the theme of tribal fertility. A certain amount of anthropomorphic treatment of these trophies was also reported. During the feasting, corn and beans were thrown to the scalps; the relatives of dead Mohave warriors sometimes "treated the scalps mean," venting their anger by mocking them and throwing dust upon them. The scalps appear to have been dangerous trophies of tribal power whose display produced a feeling of tribal unity and confidence. Forde says that the Yuma sometimes took the scalps on a war party to insure success against the same enemy, but this was not reported by the Mohave.20 Although they were tribal symbols, there was a specific connection between the kwaxot and the scalps in his keeping since they were discarded upon his death. This is understandable in the light of the Mohave feeling that the important officials were tribal representatives who achieved their power by dreaming. Al- though the scalps "belonged" to a particular custodian, they were tribal symbols, since the custodian himself was a tribal functionary, given his power by the creators for the benefit of the entire tribe. It is clear that the status of k"axot formed the nexus of two great themes of Mohave life: warfare and tribal continuity through fertility. The scalper, who was also a shaman, exemplified the connection between warfare and the Mohave "racist" philosophy in which non-contamination with foreign blood was always a 20 C. D. Forde, Ethnography of the Yuma Indians (University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology, vol. 28, no. 4, 1931), p. 168.</page><page sequence="13">MOHAVE WARFARE 109 primary consideration. Warfare was a means of demonstrating tribal prowess and superiority to other tribes. Thus the statuses of kwaxot and axwe satumac formed the structural connections for three extremely important themes of Mohave life: warfare, sickness, and tribal continuity through fertility. The minor status of yakatha'alya needs little discussion. As seen above, this status was occupied by females. They danced at the scalp ceremonies and shamed the men who had not gone on the warpath. In order to occupy this position a dream was necessary, but it was not a very powerful one, according to informants. The position was not an important one but it did serve to give expression to the female interest in the activity of warfare. The women were no less proud of Mohave prowess than men, and they demonstrated it by heaping scorn upon able-bodied men who had not gone to war. A brief word about the status of chief (xanidal) is necessary before conclud- ing this discussion. As indicated earlier in this paper, the chief was excluded from warlike activities. This may not be an accurate reflection of aboriginal conditions. The status of xanidal apparently did not exist prior to fairly extensive White contact. According to several informants, the first chief was chosen after the Whites came, when it became necessary to deal with them. The status was fitted into the aboriginal pattern, but not completely, since, although the chief was supposed to dream his power, the office also became hereditary. The first chief was selected because he was "lucky" in his dealings with the Whites. It appears probable that the status of chief represented an elaboration of the rather vaguely defined status of pataxan, local group leader. The Mohave lived in small settlements scattered throughout the valley. The nucleus of a settlement was a patrilocal extended family, of which the male head had considerable prestige as the representative of his people. These local group leaders formed an informal council which deliberated about important tribal affairs. The kwaxot was the main tribal leader, performing religious functions that contributed to tribal integration. The scalper was also a tribal official, since only one man occupied this status at any one time. The braves, who were scat- tered throughout the valley, had some local autonomy in dealing with raids and small revenge parties. The kwaxot and scalper were in charge of tribal war ex- peditions as revealed by the fact that scalps could not be taken in the absence of the scalper and that the kwaxot cared for these trophies in the interest of the entire tribe. The status of chief, then, developed as a result of the necessity of dealing with the Whites in an organized manner. The principal tribal status of religious leadership, kwaxot, declined in importance rapidly when the culture began to change under the impact of Whites. The new status of chief lacked</page><page sequence="14">110 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY the connections with religion and war that characterized that of kwaxot, and appears to have been based upon the status of pataxan, or local group leader. There is considerable doubt that the sharp separation between war and peace activities represented by the complete divorce of the chief from warfare is an old, pre-white Mohave pattern. In concluding this summary of the main statuses concerned with warfare, it should be stated that several of these positions might occasionally have been occupied by the same person. Sometimes a brave was also a spy, and, more rarely, a shaman. The scalper might also have been a brave in some cases. Likewise a pataxan was sometimes a shaman or a brave. The ultimate determinant of the statuses a man would occupy depended upon his dreams. As a general rule, however, a person occupied only one of the major tribal statuses, the tribal structure, as outlined above being fairly clear and definite. CAUSES OF WARFARE To ask, in general terms, "Why did the Mohave engage in warfare?" is likely to reveal more about recent Western European culture than about Mohave cul- ture. The question indicates our instrumental conception of war: that it is a means to an end-an instrument of national policy designed to achieve certain economic or political goals. We also believe that war is not inevitable and that a state of continuous peace is conceivable. The Mohave did not regard warfare in this way. Their conception of war was largely non-instrumental: it was an end in itself. The typical response of Mohave informants attempting to convey an understanding of almost any aspect of their culture was to narrate the parts of the origin myth pertaining to the subject of inquiry, and war was no exception. Warfare was instituted by Mastamxo, who decreed that certain people in each generation would experience power-dreams connected with it.21 For the Mohave, then, warfare was a con- stant, inevitable part of their total way of life. Of course they recognized certain motivations for specific instances of warfare, but these were subordinated in their thinking to a generalized conception of war as an end in itself decreed at the creation of society. This Mohave answer is not likely to satisfy the instrumentally oriented social scientist. Consequently, a consideration of the possible psycho- logical and sociological factors, both conscious and unconscious, which motivated Mohave warfare will be undertaken. One of the most specific and conscious causes of war was defense against an enemy attack. Although these were usually small engagements, sometimes 21 Kroeber, Seven Mohave Myths, pp. 57-58.</page><page sequence="15">MOHAVE WARFARE 111 there was sufficient warning to permit a large fighting force, tribal in scope, to meet the enemy. The evidence indicates, however, that the Mohave were more frequently the aggressors rather than defenders. Another frequent cause of war was revenge. Sometimes a large expedition set out to avenge the death or capture of a fellow tribesman. More frequently small parties went out at the instigation of a relative of the person killed by the enemy. A brave would not rest until he took revenge upon the tribe responsible for the death of one of his relatives or friends. Another stimulus for a war party was the desire for prestige on the part of young men who had dreamed the power to be braves. Such young men would try to get an experienced brave to lead a small raiding expedition or might even persuade the scalper to lead a tribal foray against the enemy. Sometimes a young brave killed a captive who was living among the Mohave "to prove his desire for war." The braves were men of great prestige who felt that they were destined to fight and die in battle. They were anxious for war in order to demonstrate their superiority over the "common people." This was probably a rather important motivation for war among the Mohave. An elite group, dependent upon war for their prestige, constantly tried to "keep things stirred up" so that they could demonstrate their prowess and fulfill their destiny. Alliances, principally with the Yuma, constituted another reason for sending out a tribal war party. Kroeber mentions a Mohave expedition that joined the Yuma, at their invitation, to attack the Cocopa.22 Another reason for going to war, from the Mohave point of view, was to take scalps and capture prisoners. Kroeber mentions a kwaxot who requested his relatives to go on a war party and to bring back several female captives to him.23 The captives could have had little economic importance. They were usually given as wives to old men, which may have been a way of keeping the oldsters in favor of frequent warfare as well as increasing tribal fertility. The main reason for desiring scalps and prisoners was probably religious. At any rate, the desire for scalps and prisoners appears to have been an important reason for going to war as indicated by several myths recorded by Kroeber.24 Modern thinking about warfare usually stresses the causal importance of eco- nomic factors. The Mohave and the Yuma waged such constant warfare against the Halchidhoma and Kohuana that these groups left the Colorado River valley and joined the Maricopa on the Gila early in the nineteenth century. One in- 22 Kroeber, Handbook, p. 745. 23 Idem, p. 746. 24 Kroeber, Seven Mohave Myths, pp. 34, 39, 61.</page><page sequence="16">112 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY formant vaguely suggested that a reason for this continuous harassment was that the Mohave and Yuma desired to hunt in their territory. One of Stewart's informants also suggested a possible economic reason for driving out the inhabit- ants of the valley around Parker, saying, "I don't know why the Mohave did it-I guess they wanted to hog everything like the Whites.""5 The first of these suggestions does not seem to provide an adequate explana- tion because hunting was the least important subsistence activity of the Mohave. Furthermore, the Mohave apparently did not move down into Halchidhoma territory for a considerable time after they departed for the Gila. Sometimes a successful Mohave expedition drove the enemy out of their territory. The Mohave would live there for a time-several months in some instances-but then would return to the Mohave valley. They did not plant crops on enemy land, nor attempt to occupy it permanently. Furthermore, the Mohave were under no compulsion to increase their supply of food by acquiring new land. As a matter of fact, they made no attempt to utilize their own land to its potential capacity. Castetter and Bell flatly state: "River Yuman warfare never had an economic objective since enemy crops were not destroyed or confiscated."26 At an earlier period in Mohave history there may have been an important economic motivation for the warfare necessary to secure the fertile river valley. Kroeber has published one of the "Great Tales" which describes the invasion and final occupation of the valley by the Mohave.27 One of the motivations of the leaders of this movement was the desire to take the valley so that crops could be grown and the people would have plenty to eat. At this period, at least as described by the Mohave "Great Tale," there may have been an important economic motive behind warfare. However, once the valley was permanently occupied, there seem to have been no further imperialistic adventures. Kroeber suggests that another element of possible historical reality to be found in the "Great Tale" was the shifting back and forth between the river and desert habitat and subsistence.28 It is possible that famine due to inadequate flooding of the river sometimes sent the Mohave out of the valley in search of other food in the desert. This may be thought to have led to warfare, but the fact is that the Mohave almost never fought with the desert tribes such as the Chemehuevi, or the hunting and gathering Walapai of the valley to the northeast. Indeed, a look at the groups against whom they traditionally fought does not 25 Stewart, Mohave Warfare, p. 257. 26 Castetter and Bell, Yuman Indian Agriculture, p. 250. 27 A. L.

The Cocopa were a favorite foe, but there seems to have been no realistic attraction in either land or crops since their location is far to the south and not adjacent to Mohave territory. Fighting was likewise carried on against the Maricopa and Halchid- homa who were located on the Gila River, much too far away for their territory to have been economically exploited by the Mohave. The evidence, therefore, leads to the conclusion that, except for the period in which the valley was being occupied, economic reasons for Mohave warfare were quite unimportant, if indeed they existed at all. A psychological motivation for Mohave warfare suggested by Kroeber is that it was a kind of sport, engaged in as a relief from boredom.29 The evidence indicates that, for the braves at least, warfare was their main object in life and that they became restive after a period of inactivity. Furthermore, the people as a whole gained a great deal of vicarious satisfaction from war and its associated activities as evidenced by the high prestige of braves, the scalp dance, the encour- agement of war by women, and the emphasis on war in myths and stories. Stewart comments on the obsessive interest of the braves in warfare, but he suggests that the people as a whole were pacifically inclined.30 A further indication that some might not have regarded war as a "game" comes from an account given by Curtis of the division of the tribe around 1857, when part of them moved from the Mohave valley south to the reservation at Parker. The chief, who refused to move, desired to retain the old culture as much as possible. The leader of the Parker group was friendlier to the Whites and wished to arrive at a better accommodation with them. This leader is quoted as follows: Wake up in the night, hear the owl hoot, run to the mesquite. No good. In morning look out, far off see a cloud of dust (a sign of a war party), run to the mesquite. No good. All tribes same color, all tribes brothers. Live in peace, have farms, plenty to eat. That good.31 How far this attitude represented the disintegration of the culture is hard to say. It seems likely, however, that some of the "ordinary people" were not overly fond of the constant warfare that once characterized the Mohave. The fatalistic orientation of the culture apparently led them to accept it until marked changes occurred under conditions of acculturation. 29 A. L. Kroeber, "Preface" (in G. Devereux, Sexual Life of the Mohave Indians, op. cit.) 30 Stewart, Mohave Warfare, p. 257. 31 E. S. Curtis, The North American Indian (12 vols., Cambridge, 1907-1922), vol. 2 [1908], p. 49. Parentheses mine.</page><page sequence="18">114 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The types of motivation thus far discussed provide, at best, a partial under- standing of the place of warfare in the life of the Mohave. Fuller comprehension can be gained only by indicating the relationship of war to religion. In this respect the Mohave data lead to a conclusion similar to the one expressed by Forde in his study of the neighboring Yuma: Fighting was not justified merely as a virile pursuit, nor was economic need adduced as a factor; warfare to the Yuma possessed a strong mystical value as the means whereby the spiritual power of the entire tribe was enhanced and at the same time demonstrated.32 The origin myth was an expression of the basic philosophical premises of Mohave culture. It embodied the fatalistic belief that all behavior was determined by the patterns established by the creators. All power was received by dreaming, and it was the identical power which had been given by Mastamxo in the beginning. This resulted in a static conception of the universe. In each generation certain individuals automatically occupied the statuses which made up the social system, but the system itself remained unchanged. All of the important tribal officials were sacred specialists in the sense that they derived their power directly from the creators by means of unsought dream experiences.33 The religious implications of the scalps and scalp dances, as well as the position of the custodian of the scalps as the major religious leader, have already been discussed. It seems clear that the status of custodian of the scalps formed the nexus of two great themes of Mohave life, warfare and tribal fertility. The third important theme, sickness, was also related to warfare through the concept of "enemy sickness" and the status of scalper. It appears that the fullest com- prehension of Mohave warfare results from regarding it as an expression of their nationalistic religious philosophy. This interpretation throws light upon Stewart's hypothesis that the main reason for Mohave warfare was the obsessive behavior of the braves over whom the people had no control.34 The reason for the obsessive desire for war on the part of the braves was religion, embodied in myth and perpetuated by unsought power-dreams. They had dreamed war power, and therefore it was their nature to want war. It also explains why they constantly were able to keep the tribe embroiled in war although some of the people may have been peacefully inclined. According to Mohave philosophy the specialists who dreamed power were tribal 32 Forde, Ethnography of the Yuma Indians, p. 161. 33 G.

The people were dependent upon them to play the roles decreed by the creator. There was no direct, personal relationship with the supernatural for the average Mohave; the tribal officials did those things which were essential for the welfare of all. This was explicitly recognized by informants who said that the "common people"-meaning those who did not have important power-dreams-"did not try to do anything but just depended upon those who had good dreams." Thus, although some of the people may have disliked war, it was still a part of life decreed by Mastamxo and they had to make the best of it. The braves had dreamed war-power, thus it was their nature to fight, and the "common people" made no attempt to interfere, but participated in war as an expression of the tribal religion. The attitude was, and is, often manifested in the resignation of "these things come." In a recent article Newcomb points out the necessity of distinguishing the causes of war from the reasons why individual men fight.35 Such individual motivations of Mohave warfare as boredom, obsessive behavior, revenge, or the desire for prestige do not satisfactorily explain tribal wars. These motivations were expressions of the basic magico-religious system which must be regarded as the primary cause of Mohave warfare, although, of course, warfare in turn strengthened and reinforced the "nationalistic" religion. This would probably not be regarded as a satisfactory explanation from Newcomb's point of view. He states: "The particular forms which war may take are of course varied, but war- fare everywhere and at all times is alike in one respect; it is motivated by eco- nomic need and the biological competition of societies, real or imagined, basic or otherwise.""3 Presumably, for Newcomb, Mohave warfare would have to be ex- plained by factors such as a struggle with other peoples for good land or some other value in short supply. The possibility of important economic motivation for war has been discussed above and largely discounted, except possibly in the early period when the fertile river valley was occupied. If the economic determinist position is adhered to, the interpretation would have to be that the warlike aspects of the religious system developed to support the economically motivated invasion of the valley. Then, becoming an end in itself, it was perpetuated as a kind of survival for a period of several centuries. While such a possibility cannot be absolutely denied, it seems rather far-fetched. The facts do not push one to such a conclusion. By shifting the argument into the field of definition, one might question, 35 W. W. Newcomb, A Re-examination of the Causes of Plains Warfare (American An-- thropologist, vol. 52, pp. 317-330, 1950), p. 320. 36 Idem, p. 317.</page><page sequence="20">116 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY whether or not Mohave combat was true warfare. It is probably helpful to dis- tinguish feuds, or other fighting between families, clans, or gangs, from warfare which is carried on, according to the several definitions mentioned below, by "independent political units" or "societies." This would seem to require at least a tribal organization and a fairly strong sense of tribal unity, and would usually imply the existence of a set of specialized statuses centering about the activity of combat. Newcomb's definition is as follows: "In this paper, war will be treated as a type of armed conflict that takes place between societies, meeting in com- petition for anything that is valued by the groups involved, usually consisting of territory or certain products of this territory, such as good hunting grounds, oil-producing or agricultural lands."37 By this definition, an economic motivation ordinarily must be found or the armed combat is not war. Malinowski has also offered a restricted definition of war: ". . . an armed contest between two inde- pendent political units, by means of organized military force, in the pursuit of a tribal or national policy."38 In his analysis, Malinowski makes it clear that fighting motivated by glory or mystical systems is not to be considered true warfare. Other writers have not defined warfare so narrowly. Speier, for example, has suggested three types of warfare: "absolute," or unrestricted and unregulated war in which the aim is to completely annihilate the enemy; "instrumental," or war carried on for economic or political advantage; and "agonistic," or war motivated by the symbolic value associated with victory.39 Mohave warfare probably fits best in the third category. Schneider argues that the character of the social unit engaged in fighting is the crucial point in defining war. Organized fighting on a tribal scale is to be regarded as war and distinguished from feuds and from the desire for blood revenge upon an enemy instigated by the relatives of the deceased as a private matter, no action being taken by the tribe as a whole.40 Wright distinguishes between "defensive," "social," "economic," and "political" war. Social war includes fighting for blood revenge, glory, sport, religion, etc.41 According to these writers Mohave combat was warfare of the "agonistic" or "social" type rather than "instrumental" or "economic," but war- fare nevertheless. 37 Ibid. 38 B.

He states five conditions which are necessary for true war: (1) tactical opera- tions; (2) definite command and control; (3) ability to conduct a campaign for the reduction of enemy resistance if the first battle fails; (4) the combat must have a group motive rather than an individual one, or even one based on kinship, since war is above the plane of feuds; (5) a surplus supply of food sufficient to sustain an army in the field.42 Mohave fighting met these conditions, although, as compared with modern warfare, only in a rudimentary fashion. The Mohave practiced simple tactics under the command of specialists acting in the interests of the entire tribe. There was a division of the fighting force into bowmen for firepower, clubbers for shock, and spies for intelligence. From Turney-High's point of view Mohave fighting would seem to be classifiable as warfare, albeit of a simple kind. In summary, if it be accepted that humans are capable of making choices, within limits imposed by the organic and inorganic world, and that values are the factors influencing choice, then the decision to fight or not to fight derives from the hierarchy of values presented to the members of a society largely through their culture. It must be remembered that values are of many kinds: economic, religious, artistic, familial, etc. If economic values are to motivate war, there must be a significant differential between their satisfaction under current conditions and a greater satisfaction believed to be achievable by conquest. Where, as in the river valleys of the region under discussion, there was substan- tially identical capability of satisfying material wants, wars were not likely to be fought for economic reasons. The Mohave, Yuma, Halchidhoma, Maricopa, and Cocopa all seem to have been about equally capable of meeting their material requirements, with none having a significant advantage of environment or culture. Indeed, if there was a slightly greater surplus produced by one of these tribes, it was probably the Mohave, the traditional aggressors, who had the advantage. Only if population pressure had been heavily felt, which it apparently was not, would there have been the likelihood of one of these tribes seeking to maximize material values by means of warfare. In the Plains, as Newcomb has demonstrated, the introduction of horses, rifles, and other goods deriving originally from European culture did provide significant advantages for those who could control them. Warfare, in this case, was encouraged by the attempt to maximize economic values. In a more stable situation, such as characterized the lower Colorado River area, in which all tribes 42 H. H. Turney-High, Primitive War (Columbia, S. C., 1949), p. 30.</page><page sequence="22">118 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY possessed substantially the same technical and environmental resources, a material differential sufficient to become a major incentive to war was lacking. Conse- quently, the activity of organized, inter-tribal fighting must have been motivated by other values. From the standpoint of increasing our knowledge of human behavior, it seems wiser to seek the values which are actually motivating a widespread activity than to assume a priori that only one kind of value can be connected with it. A large part of our understanding of why men and societies fight must be eliminated by assuming that they fight only to maximize material values. The Mohave seem to represent a case in which tribal warfare, producing a number of specialized statuses, was not carried on primarily for economic reasons, but because it was inextricably bound up with the religious system of the society.
