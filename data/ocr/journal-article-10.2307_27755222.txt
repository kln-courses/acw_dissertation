Moving (Beyond) International Law Florian E Hoffmann* Anthony Carty Philosophy of International Law, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007, 255 pp, hb ?66.50. The second half of the 1980s saw the publication of two remarkable analyses of international law, Anthony Carty s The Decay of International Law: A Reappraisal of the Limits of Legal Imagination in International Affairs ('Decay)1 in 1986 and, three years later, Martti Koskenniemis From Apology to Utopia: The Structure of International Legal Argument (6FATU).2 When they came out, the world was still just about in the grip of the Cold War. Much of international politics consisted of the ritualistic posturing of the two political blocks in different global theatres; and international law and international lawyers seemed to have been relegated to being smoothers of their respective princes path.3 Both works set out to take issue with the way the discipline understood itself and its object, and how it related to its constitutive other, international politics. And both won their authors considerable acclaim (or disdain) as (so called) critical legal thinkers. A quarter of a century later, the world has much changed, yet the fundamental predicament of international law as diagnosed in these earlier texts has arguably not. So much so that both authors have felt it necessary to return to their earlier argument in order to restate and reinforce their point, and underline its continued currency in present day condi tions. Koskenniemi has done this, in more or less equal measure, through his seminal The Gentle Civilizer of Nations: The Rise and Fall of International Law (Gentle Civilizer)4 and a re-edition of From Apology to Utopia, amended by a sizeable Epi logue.5 Carty, in turn, has published his Philosophy of International Law ('Philosophy) as an explicit, if qualified, sequel to Decay (Decay). Both these re-visits express bemusement about the apparent fact that, despite the opening up of legal-political possibilities after 1990 and the constant broadening of the reach of international law,6 the 'profession has continued to engage in what both works denounce in different ways as a legal managerialism, full of politics but devoid of political *Law Department, London School of Economics and Political Science. 1 A.

Hoffmann commitment.7 Yet rather than merely reiterate their critique of the 'profession, both have attempted to go one step further by proposing an alternative for inter national law ? albeit in cautious, tentative and sometimes vague terms. This, as much as their common diagnosis, unites them and singles them out as being among the (relatively) few who, in an Arendtian sense, have sought to act on their critique. Notoriously, Koskenniemi has done so by, introducing on the margins of Gen tle Civilizer what he called the culture of formalism, a term he himself used with circumspection and has since tried to avoid, but which nonetheless mesmerised the discussion and created a focal point for critical thought in/on international law. Indeed, it has had repercussions well beyond critical legal circles and has brought in a much wider international legal public,8 so much so that it has argu ably become a compass for any reflection on what it is that international lawyers are, and what, instead, they ought to be doing.9 Taking his cues from classical' critical legal thought,10 he attributes the crisis of international law to the inherent indeterminacy of (international) legal norms and the structural political bias with which the application of apparently neutral norms is imbued. Both of these he sees as embedded in the deep structure of international legal discourse, which unfolds between the apology of power and the Utopia of such ideals as peace, jus tice or equality.11 Having exposed the deep grammar of international legal dis course in FATU, Koskenniemi then traced the historical actualisation of this structure in Gentle Civilizer, and found that international law, as a self-consciously modern conceptual framework, had left behind its Utopian origins as a politically progressive intervention into power politics and had developed steadily into an apologetic provider of debating chips for the (state) powers that be. With this ana lysis, he confirmed and deepened insights widely shared among the critical com munity, but, importantly, he also uncovered the (potentially) progressive origins of the (so called) mainstream'.12 7 Koskenniemi, n 4 above, 15. 8 See inter alia M.

Chimni has it, 'mainstream international law scholarship' (or 'MILS'), while often casually used by both its adherents and its detractors, is, of course, theoretically charged and problematic, as much as its antonym, notably marginalism, New Stream, New Approaches to International Law (or 'NAIL') etc. Carty uses the term in the title of his second chapter, and infrequently thereafter. For his purposes, the historical connotation of 'modern or, indeed, classical' - as Jens Bartelson defines the Hobbesian/Vatellian approach - is probably better suited to describe the 'mainstream'. There is, as will be discussed briefly below, generally a degree of vagueness attached to Carty s use of 'mainstream'/'modern'/ classical', it is sometimes associated also with positivism, at other times with the 'practitioner's approach to international law'.

Moving (Beyond) International Law Koskenniemi s culture of formalism seeks, then, to reframe international legal discourse from within its formalist premises, notably by showing it to contain all the elements necessary to move it back from the current apologism to a politically progressive Utopia. He consequently affirms that the vocabulary of formal (legal) norms and the judicial and quasi-judicial institutions within which it is per formed offers the most hopeful platform for transformative politics under current global conditions, provided such strategic legal interventionism is aware of its own contingency and refrains from essentialising its lacking centre through rei fied concepts such as governance, human rights, constitutionalisation etc.13 Indeed, the emphasis is on strategic processes that avoid crystallisation into firm institutions or structures and thereby stay clear of the legal managerialism which has, Koskenniemi thinks, taken over the profession. Even though the theoretical underpinnings of the culture of formalism clearly betray its critical pedigree, it has nonetheless left a big door open for interested members of 'the profession, since their professional practice would appear to be quite compatible with Kos kenniemi's strategic formalism, provided their political intentions were progres sive, as would arguably be the case with many contemporary practitioners of 'lawfare',14 especially in such fields as human rights, humanitarian law, environ mental law or labour law. The culture of formalism has, in other words, especially appealed to 'practitioners' in search of a theory. More importantly, perhaps, it has dealt out a new hand for international legal theorising, for it confronts any quest for alternatives with the facticity and functionality of 'traditional' formal legal language and the interpretative community of international lawyers. It has, thereby, defined the question which contemporary international legal theory has to address before anything else, notably whether there is, or can be, anything out side of the formalist box.15 One who has quite clearly understood this question and who has picked up the challenge it represents is, of course, the author of the Philosophy, for whom there most definitely is an alternative. It is built on a similar analysis of the crisis of international law as Koskenniemi's, and has evolved over a similarly long period of time. Both contributions can be seen as self-consciously remedial discourses, build on a medical plot that unfolds through an exposition of symptoms, diagnosis, and therapy, and that aims at curing the patient, namely international law, from the ailments it has acquired over time. Neither explicitly uses medical metaphor, but both can be structured around the intent to remedy a discourse and a discipline in which both continue to believe. Yet, while sharing both concern about the symptoms of international law's ill health and the diag classifications, see B.S. Chimni,'An Outline of a Marxist Course of International Law' in S.

Hoffmann nosis, Carty fundamentally differs from Koskenniemi in his therapeutic strategy The latter effectively turns the Philosophy into a rejoinder to the culture of form alism, an alternative interpretation of the symptoms of international law's (poli tical) ailments, a veritable if oblique Gegegenentwurf. To appreciate just what Carty is offering, the reader of Philosophy has, unfortu nately, first to master what an earlier, although ultimately sympathetic, reviewer called a disparate set of essays, with no coherent theme' that leaves the reader with an overall sense of incoherence due to the absence of any effort to connect the dots by providing a unifying argument.'16 Indeed, Carty does himself no favour by hiding his thought in a stream of consciousness-style narrative that largely devel ops its plot by contouring the author's motley choice of books selected to exem plify the different aspects of his theory. While this is not in itself a bad strategy, the sheer number and breadth of readings is daunting, ranging from classics of inter national studies such as Vitoria, Grotius, or, again and again, Hobbes, via such disparate contemporary international lawyers as Emmanuelle Jouannet, Rene and Pierre-Marie Dupuy Guy De Lacharriere, Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, Alfred Verdross and Bruno Simma, Karl D?hring, or, indeed, David Kennedy and, of course, Koskenniemi, to (political) philosophers, theologians and physi cists. What is more, these works are reviewed in a somewhat jumbled fashion, with some being treated to prolonged discussion and others just being name dropped en passant, without it being made clear why this should be so. Indeed, with the exception of his nemesis Hobbes, Carty's treatment of these texts leaves the reader in some doubt as to whether they are building blocks for his own the oretical construct, or examples of what the latter is up against. This may arguably have something to do with a certain methodological experimentalism which relates to Carty's attempt to reconstruct an alternative language of international law - on which more below - but it is hardly conducive to winning him disciples. Not a shadow of doubt is left, on the other hand, as to what Carty thinks is the ideal-typical incorporation of the Hobbesian state in the contemporary world, namely the real-existing United States. And the book's self-conscious anti-Amer ican tone17 unnecessarily introduces an element of reductive stereotyping that contradicts Carty's overall objective of de-simplifying the story international law tells. Yet, this is not an author to mince words or to engage in overly didactic gestures to his readership, but one who lets the willing reader share his own exis tential concern for international law and what it does to the world. The book is permeated by a spirit of earnest inquietude with the global state of affairs, the role played by 'traditional' international law, and the anxious quest for an alternative. In this sense, the Philosophy's quixotic style betrays the humanist predisposition at the core of Carty's argument. 16 R. Falk, 'Review Essay on A.

Moving (Beyond) International Law THE SYMPTOMS What, then, is that argument? As with Koskenniemi, Philosophy's starting point is a profound discomfort with the way international law is conceived and practised in the contemporary world. This is not a discomfort over the relevance or even the basic validity of the concept of international law as such, it is, on the contrary, a passionate concern about the health of a discourse the necessity of which Carty at no point calls into doubt. What he does call into doubt is the dominant concep tion of international law, which he sees as a symptom of disease, notably the gra dual consumption of the original body of the law of nations. The outward appearance of the disease is what he calls, in Philosophy's second chapter, the con tinuing uncertainty in the mainstream' (26). What he refers to is not merely the indeterminacy of legal language, the preeminent theme of critical legal studies,18 but the lurking doubt about the law's substance that besets international lawyers in regular intervals. It is a doubt concisely described in that second chapter, nota bly with reference to the sources doctrine upon which the classical' tradition builds its conception, and, in particular, the arche-source of all international law, namely custom. As he does throughout the book, Carty elaborates his point in the form of an intriguing conjunction of jurisprudential analysis and the contrasting of different publicists on the theme. Hence, in his treatment of custom, it is, in the main the Nicaragua,19 Nuclear Weapons,20 Arrest Warrant,21 and Waif2 cases, as well as two exponents of the French tradition - the, in Carty s terms, positivist idealist Rene Dupuy and the realist Guy Ledreit de Lacharriere ? through which he seeks to expose why the classical' theory of custom represents a 'paralysis of reflective intellect and moral sense' (55). Carty s issue is the idea of opinio juris, the subjective complement of objective state practice, and the inherent indeterminacy that attaches to it. The fact that one of the two doctrinally required criteria for customary law creation is vague and slippery is, to Carty, no mere happenstance, but reveals the underlying pro blem with the classical' conception. That problem consists in what, for Carty, boils down to a false ontology of international law, coupled with a false epistemology of international lawyers. On a first level of analysis, Carty re-states an old critique of custom,23 namely that 'the state is itself, as a totality. . . capable of having 'legal sense' (27). This counterfactual assumption creates an original divide between the multiple facets ofthat which the 'state' stands for and which Carty seeks to recover, and the reductive and anthropomorphic Hobbesian State which Carty thinks underlies classical' international law. The latter, to Carty, is a fiction without real 18 Koskenniemi, n 4 above, 11. 19 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Hoffmann being, and the painstaking examination of its expressions of will by international lawyers cannot ever reveal the 'will of the state as international law's constitutive signified. If the classical' conception of statehood is ontologically implausible to Carty so is its idea of legality, premised, according to him, either on naive positi vism, superficial idealism, or nationalist prejudice (33). In a move that resembles Koskenniemi's analysis of international legal argument as the structural coupling of a legalist (positivist/objectivist) and pure facts (realist) account of inter-state normativity Carty stakes Dupuy against De Lacharriere to a similar end; the for mer holds that international law emerges through a dialectical mediation between cooperation, which is institutional and horizontal, and conflict, which is rela tional and vertical. To the latter, this is a form of transcendentalism removed from the reality that states retain control of the interpretation of international law, so that there is merely an application of multiple conflicting state policies' (31).24 Carty rejects both accounts, because they are ultimately premised on a false ontol ogy of international legality, one that is conceived of in abstraction from the his toricity of grown national collectivities. It is the false ontologies of statehood and legality that deprive customary rules of a concrete foundation and turn them into virtual, and, hence, ultimately indisposable, empty norms. Yet, that emptiness triggers, as Carty shows, an epistemological shift towards the interpretative authority of international courts. For him, there is a residual confidence among international lawyers that the international judiciary can, "reveal" . . . the presence of custom, and turn it from virtual to real law' (27). In other words, the indeter minacy of custom is covered up by the determinism of judges. That determinism, however, cannot actually be seen as what it is, for otherwise international legal process would be revealed as essentially arbitrary. Judicial decisions must, hence, be couched in terms of reasons purporting to be universally comprehensible and compelling. Yet, as Carty shows in his analysis of recent case law, that is not what courts have provided. Rather, courts have employed the subjective' element of custom to spin a particular factual situation towards a certain conception of legality or illegality. Hence, in Nicaragua, the ICJ used opinio juris (in relation to customary exceptions to the prohibition of inter-state intervention in internal affairs) to reframe what, for Carty, was an issue of high politics in the formalistic terms of legal intentionality (29), thereby dodging the issues at the heart of the conflict. Similarly, in what is, perhaps, the quintessential hard case, the Nuclear Weapons decision, Carty sees custom as playing the role of legitimising the Court's absten tion from a substantial determination of legality. He thus calls its refusal even to examine opinio in relation to the doctrine of deterrence scandalous and . . . show ing the utter bankruptcy of the doctrine of positivist customary law' (p 35). Likewise, he cites approvingly the ad hoc (dissenting) judge Christine van den Wyngaert who, in the Arrest Warrant case, stated that the pseudo-application of custom as a reflection of state practice could erase the very idea of balance of con flicting principles' (45), alluding to the Court's avoidance of a substantive weigh ing of two conflicting claims, namely for universal jurisdiction and for sovereign 24 RJ.

Moving (Beyond) International Law immunity and its 'deferral' to what Carty regards as a spurious reading of state practice and opinio on the matter. He closes his examination of custom with a fas cinating digression on the importance of secrecy in state practice, and the limita tions this imposes on the 'finding' of an opinio by a court (or an international lawyer), through the example, contained in an appendix, of the Oman and Mus cat incident in British diplomatic history. It is in these sections, in which Carty most directly engages with the essence of the classical' tradition, notably the inter pretation of jurisprudence in light of doctrine, that he reveals himself as most ambivalent. For in order to support his dismissal of the Court's reasoning as a mere reproduction of the false ontology that he sees at the heart of international law's decay, he engages in the very exercise, namely a close textual reading of judg ments and dissents, that he sets out to overcome. Put differently Carty seems to want to engage substantively in the querelle des interpretations, and, at the same time, reject that querelle as irrelevant to the concerns of international law proper. In the best textbook tradition, he appears to be diving into the case law, only then to single out a few judicial statements through which he rhetorically underlines his case against the classical' way of interpreting case law. He thereby leaves the reader uncertain as to the authority he attributes to the classical'sources of international law and the judicial bodies charged with deciding upon them. Would the latter in principle be competent to pronounce the right' international law - one cured from false ontology - if only it applied, in Carty's view, right' reasoning; or would the very idea of a sources doctrine and judicial bodies pronouncing upon it be nonsensical from Carty's perspective? This important question is left open, mak ing it correspondingly hard for the reader to assess his reading of case law, for want of a clear framework of reference. On balance, Carty tends to see interna tional judgments as more or less sophisticated attempts artificially to graft inter national law's false ontology onto facts which, for him, would militate towards different conclusions. This view is in line with his therapeutic strategy - explored below - which would have international legal discourse consist of a much wider array of relevant facts than the classical' method, and with it existing international courts, could admit. Having dissected the classical' treatment of custom, Carty goes on to exemplify his critique of the (false) ontology of international law with further deep readings of the grand themes of international relations, namely statehood (chapter three), the use offeree (chapter four), the conjunction of statehood and force in an ideal typical United States (chapter five) and the international economic regime (chap ters six and seven). Statehood, which is accorded a privileged ontological function in Carty's analysis of international law, is examined with reference to the Frontier Dispute25 and the Island of Palmas26 case, cross cut by a tour deforce reading of con trasting continental (mostly French and German) conceptions of statehood.27 To 25 Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso v.

Hoffmann Carty, international law's idea of statehood is intimately connected to the histori cally grown views on territory and nationality held by European nation-states and their immediate offspring. Starting with the principle of effectiveness as out lined by Antonio Cassese in his International Law, Carty shows how the formal criteria of statehood are entangled with the colonialist notion of civilization and serve at once a differentiation and an incorporation function.28 By promoting an idea of abstract statehood the legitimacy of which is based on force - notably effective control over territory - and verisimilitude - with alike entities, historical European nation states created the basis for both their colonial expansion and their absolute integrity, not to be challenged by claims for self determination on part of any of their constituent components (82). The corollary of this, notably that self-determination is subject to the consent of existing nation states, is tautological in Carty's view and serves only to preserve the club-like atmosphere of the community of states', a logic that transpires from the Frontier Dispute case and its enshrinement of the principle of uti possidetis, as well as its later application to the disintegration of the Former Yugoslavia. The two seemingly opposed principles of territorial integrity and self-determination again reveal the muddled ontology of an international law premised on the artifice of the nation state. The latter combines the notion of an ahistorical and abstract sovereignty with one of a historically-contingent and concrete community.29 The question of self-determination sits at the dividing line between these two notions and the way it is answered is determinative of the way statehood and international society are conceived. Here Carty provides a fascinating reading of French and German responses, showing how they privilege either of the two sides of the state/nation dichotomy. The French line of argument, represented by Jean Combacau and Serge Surs Droit international public, attempts to transpose French public law theory onto an international frame, considering the state as a corporate objective entity which, on the international plane and vis-?-vis other states, acts as a monolithic entity intent on preserving-itself and maximizing its influence. Law arises in this inter national state of nature from discretionary commitments linked to collective self interest. Most importantly in relation to the question of self-determination, the nation and its historical title - or lack thereof- to the territory it inhabits is entirely subsumed by the concept of the state which, to others, including claimants of self determination, is an impenetrable black box; only when a state acts out of its own volition, or when it loses the attributes of statehood entirely, can new states come into existence on its territory. The German position, by contrast, laid out through Alfred Verdross and Bruno Simma's Universelles V?lkerrecht and Karl D?hring's V?lk errecht, is taken by Carty to come out on the side of the nation. Here, statehood is entirely contingent upon historically grown nationhood, it is not primarily terri toriality but nationality, or more precisely common descent, that defines the state, 28 See A. Angie, Imperialism, Sovereignty and the Making of International Law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007). 29 See in greater detail, F.

Moving (Beyond) International Law and its sovereignty flows from the natural' authority of the nation that underlies it. While this view prima facie privileges self-determination over territorial integ rity, it runs into trouble where statehood and nationhood do not coincide, that is, in the case of multi-ethnic states. Here Carty examines D?hring's idea of shared values as a substrate of nationhood that retains the viability of the precedence of the nation over the state; where such values no longer exist, no bar to self-deter mination can be imposed. Although the latter position feeds into Carry's substan tive propagation of the right to self-determination, his analysis of the two points of view in relation to the ontology of statehood shows that neither overcomes the state/nation dichotomy as both reify one of its sides. Again, formalised legal con cepts narrow the horizon and block access to the 'things themselves'.30 Although, between the lines, he seems to find the 'German approach' more attuned to his community-oriented vision, he again leaves the reader in some doubt as to what precisely he wishes to show with these contrasting readings. Once more, a suspi cion is raised that they essentially serve a straw-person function, as stylised repre sentations of discourses he aims to critique and move beyond. His reading thus remains a rough cut. His subsequent treatments of the use of force and the international economic regime, as well as his revisit of statehood in a vivisection of the present-day Uni ted States are less directly constructed on the judicial articulation of international legal doctrine and introduce a wider set of readings. They nonetheless follow a similar line as the initial exposition and are used as thematic wedges to make, from several different angles, his overall point as to false ontology. Hence, he uses the chapter on the use offeree to analyse the dichotomy between the prohibition of the use offeree (Art. 2(4)) and the right to self defence (Article 51) as yet another case in point of the ambiguity that inheres international law in the classical' con ception. For Carty, this dichotomy boils down to a fundamental conflict between state sovereignty and international legality. Both negate the respective other, yet both are meant to be constitutive principles of the international. This conflict is neither solved in the predominant voluntarist Vattellian conception, in which leg ality flows from sovereignty, nor in the objectivist Kelsenian one, in which legal ity is constitutive of sovereignty. The former cannot, as Carty observes on the basis of his reading of Emmanuelle Jouannet's Emer de Vattel et Vemergence doctrinale du droit international classique31 provide for an absolute (legal) limitation of the dis cretionary use of force by states because it holds that states are themselves the interpreters of rules they have undertaken to comply with (116). For Carty, Jouan net's reading of the voluntarist conception reduces international law to being no more than the expression of the relations between free and equal states. Hans Kel sen, by contrast, embodies the ultimately failed post-World War I movement against voluntarism and in favour of institutionalisation/constitutionalisation. It attempted to legalise the use offeree by redefining it as the legal sanction of prior and illegal aggression, that is, by postulating an international legal system in 30 The allusion is to Kant's concept of the noumenon denoting the thing-in-itself, which, in Kantian epistemology, is not directly accessible to the human mind; see I.

This idea is meant to be anchored in state practice through a system of compulsory (international) adjudi cation, though in its absence what Carty terms the institutional' approach is bound to fail (123). As with his previous readings, Jouannet's Vattel and Kelsen act more as a placeholder for the actual point Carty wishes to make, namely that the dichotomy between sovereignty and legality is in itself a dysfunctional mis conception of what lies at the heart of inter-state violence. Again, insofar as Carty s frame of reference lies outside of this dichotomy, the reader is bound either to take his point here or leave it. An internal' critique of voluntarism and objecti vism, along the lines of the argument Koskenniem makes in FATU, is not an option for Carty. In a similar vein, what Carty calls the neoliberal economic order and what he considers to be its flag-bearers, namely human rights, democratisation and the rule of law, are expressions of the prevailing voluntarism through which the state system and its law are conceived. Through an eclectic cross-analysis of the con temporary international trade regime, the forceful propagation of human rights, the rule of law and democratisation, and analytical jurisprudences reduction of law to a system of rules backed up by sanctions, Carty again dissects what he terms 'Western legal culture' in his search for cancerous tissue (211). He finds the latter in form of a multi-facetted legal phenomenon that informs the logic of contempor ary international relations: human rights, the rule of law, and democratisation are forms of conceiving social relations that express the methodological individual ism and consumerism typical of advanced capitalism (211); they are also a substan tive articulation of certain values, made out to be universal but entirely compatible with the expansion of Western economic interests' (211); what is more, legalised human rights are necessarily framed in a way compatible with voluntar isms construction of law as backed by power, so that the de facto value pluralism in the world is forcefully settled by recourse to the 'weight of the majority' (211), that is, pure power. Here, 'traditional' Marxist political economy aids Carty s ana lysis, and he defends it against its 'postmodern critics, especially those standing in a post-Marxist tradition such as Hart and Negri and their Empire.32 Lastly, Carty returns to his core theme of statehood by taking a closer look at the state he considers to be both dominant and an ideal-typical incorporation of the voluntarist Hobbesian conception of statehood, namely the United States. He does so by reading a wide range of contemporary American reflections on itself and, most notably, on its 'legal cultures of collective security', all stemming from the experience of the Bush administration (142). His purpose is to gauge the causes for US foreign policy in its cultural history and social psychology. The backdrop is formed by David Campbell, a critical international relations scholar, whose Writing Security United States Foreign Policy and the Politics of Identity33 names two logics that inform American security consciousness, namely 'the construction of the self through the exclusion of the other, and the repetitive character of the tech 32 M.

Moving (Beyond) International Law niques used to construct the self (143). On this basis, Carty analyses three aspects of American identity formation. The first, explored through Jewett and Law rences Captain America and the Crusade Against Evil,34 looks at the entanglement of (Protestant) Christian theology with the discourse of international law. That work argues that the 'faith-based presidency' propounded by the Bush Adminis tration led to a 'Deuteronomic subversion of international law' (143), an idolisa tion of the self and demonisation of the other which produced a mental 'pop fascism the script of which the Bush Administration incorporated into the domestic political process and its foreign policy. The secular pendant to this theo logical mark in American social psychology is the historically grown reflex to counter real or perceived threats through expansive pre-emption, a thesis advanced by the historian John Lewis Gaddis in his We Know Now: Rethinking Cold War History.35 Both these cultural explanations of US conduct feed into Carty's reading of several explicit (re-) statements of the American conception of interna tional law, and of collective security in particular. They confirm his suspicion that an influential line of American international legal scholarship is quite willing to do away with formal aspects of international legal process, bringing to the fore what, in his view, has for long underwritten American foreign policy, notably a cops and robbers' view of the world (159). In it, everybody else' comes to be seen as a potential robber, threats are omnipresent and the need for defence is trans formed from an exception to normality; or, rather, the exception becomes nor mality. Security can, hence, only be obtained proactively by continuously expanding one's sphere of control. The literally immeasurable threats posed by either 'terrorists' or weapons of mass destruction in rogue hands perpetuate this logic. To Carty, the Bush Administration's United States, as the quintessential late modern state, leads the Hobbesian-Vattellian conception of statehood and of international law ad absurdum. It is premised on the apparent construction of order based upon the opposition of the domestic and the foreign, and the paradox of a state system which rests upon the mutually exclusive suppositions that each is a self for itself and an other for all the others' (161). This must be an unstable con struction that is bound to implode by its own logic. Hence the Bush years mark the 'bankrupted end of an international law tradition (161). The symptom chart that emerges from this analysis shows international law to be terminally ill, consumed by the 'fragmentation of statist language'. It has become in essence a hostage to egomaniac states defined by individualist liberal ism, predatory capitalism, and aggressive self-preservation, all of which are inim ical to what, for Carty, is the law in international law. THE DIAGNOSIS How, then, does Carty explain this anamnesis? What is his diagnosis? On the most abstract level, it is modernity itself. For Carty argues that it is ultimately 34 R. Jewett and R. S.

He sets out this basic diagno sis in Philosophy's first chapter, where he distinguishes between the notions of legal doctrine and of legal dogmatics. The former, as defined in the Dictionaire encyclopedi que de theorie et de sociologie du droit with which Carty begins his reading exercise,36 emanates from the medieval and Renaissance natural law tradition and refers to interpretation and systematisation of the law. It was spontaneously and freely held opinion and its authority came from the presumed reasonableness of erudite and morally serious people (2). Legal dogmatics, by contrast, is concerned with the interpretation of legislation and jurisprudence understood as a logically coherent system of rules: it is not concerned with the values informing legal precepts nor with their meaning in relation to history, society or politics (1). Carty argues that the transition from the medieval/Renaissance period to the modern is marked by the gradual substitution of doctrine by dogmatics and the consequent change in the conception of what (international) law actually is. That change, in turn, is inti mately linked to the emergence and growth of the concept of the modern (nation) state. Its propagation, regardless of the historical vagueness of the entity it means to denote,37 goes back to Hobbes who represents, so to speak, the original cancer cell from which the modern state and modern international law developed. More precisely, it is the shift from a medieval scholastic framework to a parti cular version of Renaissance humanism, of which Hobbes is, for Carty, the apex. Following a Cartesian plot, Hobbes institutes the sovereign as the subject of inter national relations, that is, as an unquestionable epistemic origin. It 'is not named, but names, not observed, but observes, a mystery for whom everything must be transparent' (6). The expression of such sovereign subjecthood is the state, which must consequently be geared primarily towards protecting its very 'being', that is, with fending off any and all challenges to the very artificiality at its roots. This implies a suppression both of its material origins in violence - notably the 16th and 17th century wars of religion and the parallel conquest of colonial territories and the subjugation of its peoples - and its constituent components - the society and its individual members represented in the body politic.38 The result is a con ception of statehood that is modelled on the liberal ontology of social contractar ianism, with the state being conceived as an autonomous moral agent. The crucial difference from (domestic) constitutionalism is, however, that there is no contrac tually constituted Leviathan in international society, and instead what prevails is a (Hobbesian) state of nature in which every state is each other's wolf. Law is, under such circumstances, something fundamentally different from the earlier natural law. The latter produced legality through (moral) legitimacy, as set out by criteria taken to be objective by the standards of right reason. As such, it preceded and 36 A.-J.

Moving (Beyond) International Law qualified the conduct of states, and it premised the legality of warfare on criteria beyond the reach of any raison d'etat. The emergent iusgentium, however, turned the natural law logic upside down, subsuming legitimacy under legality, and turning law into the language of sovereignty The sovereign itself - that is, the state - is now the fountain of all law but not itself bound by it. It is legibus solutus, an attri bute previously arrogated by princes and the pope, both claiming ordination by God.39 The state is, hence, sacralised and removed from the sphere of human jud gement, its subjective interest is objectivised, as Jens Bartelson observes in his Gen ealogy of Sovereignty, which is Carty s main reference for this history of ideas.40 Hence, 'the image of the divinity of the state leaves the European international law tradition with a concept of the state which is incompatible with any overarch ing, binding notion of law' (126). This Hobbesian construct makes its way, though Locke and Gentili, to Vattel, who becomes the intellectual father of the prevalent voluntarist conception of international law and the liberal democratic, market oriented' (128) concept of statehood it implies. What Carty s argument entails is not that the place of law in international rela tions has been diminished, but that law signifies something fundamentally differ ent from what it did before. In effect, we are talking about two entirely different international laws', the classical' version being based on a double reduction: namely of legal doctrine to legal dogmatics (1) on one hand, and of historically grounded communities to sovereign states on the other (94). This false conception of international law is built, as we have seen, on a false ontology of both statehood and law, and has shaped modern international legal praxis. Yet with aggressive individualism at its core, modern international law could not crystallise into a stable legal system or, rather, the only stable element has been its recurrent dys functionality when it comes to regulating effectively international affairs for the benefit of its stakeholders. The shift from doctrine to dogmatics, effected by inter national lawyers, has underwritten this dysfunctionality and has led to the con tinuing crisis of international law. This is a powerful analysis, persuasive to anyone open to critical argument, and it offers an important complement to Koskenniemi's diagnosis in E47T/and Gen tle Civilizer. However, Carty himself subverts the dramatic effect of his analysis by dealing with the process of dogmatisation in a surprisingly imprecise way. Prima facie, he associates it with legal positivism ? that is, the practice of interpreting the law as law, and not as morality, politics or culture - conceiving it as logical, value free and neutral. So defined, it would indeed be an activity appropriately tailored to the functional requirements of Vatellian international law in which there is no room for independent - ie extra-legal - inquiry into the validity or meaning of the law. If that is what Carty means by positivism, then positivism would be the name for the very practice that reproduced the modern conception of interna tional law, and Carty does seem to use the term in this way on several occasions in the Philosophy. Yet that modern conception is essentially voluntarist - that is, in contemporary terminology, realist - and so is at odds with, for instance, Kelsens 39 See K. Pennington, The Prince and the Law, 1200-1600: Sovereignty and Rights in the Western Legal Tradi tion (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993). 40 Bartelson, n 12 above. ? 2009 The Author.

Indeed, both a realist (voluntarist) and an idealist (positivist) conception of law are amenable to a dog matic-positivist mode of interpretation as one that refuses to step outside of what seems to be given by the language of the law. However, to add to the confusion, Carty then also associates a self-consciously positivist mindset with the founding generation of the academic discipline of modern international law in the context of the Institute of International Law. However, these nineteenth century lawyers are hailed in the Gentle Civilizeras the pioneers of progressive legalism, and are seen by Carty as having been motivated by a preoccupation with a law of peoples. . . who exist in a morally significant global order created by God' (52). Having started out with strong and negative assumptions about legal positivism, he ends up so much as admitting that, at least in its progressive legalist form, positivism could be informed by the moral meta-narrative he is principally interested in recovering. But again this does not lead him to make a case either for a progressive legalism along the lines of Koskenniemi or against it along alternative lines. However, what the legal dogmatic (as opposed to doctrinaire) mindset ulti mately connotes for Carty is apologism. Whether it is the theoretical apologism of French voluntarism, or the 'practitioner-based' model of British pragmatism, it is the (classical) international lawyer's refusal to be what Peter Goodrich likens to the Greek nomikos,z counselor of judges and of legislators, [a] literate lawyer, [a] public scholar, [an] intellectual who would advise and debate decisions but was not [herjself a judge or governor and hence was independent in both institutional and disciplinary terms.'41 By going out of his or her way to eliminate the vestiges of this humanist heritage in (international) legal discourse, the modern interna tional lawyer has become the principal instrument of the discipline's decay. How ever, that decay, as Carty entitles it in the prequel to Philosophy, is not a true decay. For the radical alternative which Carty seeks to sketch, and which is rooted in this earlier tradition, has not so much decayed as been replaced by modern voluntar ism. For that very reason, he believes, it is possible and worthwhile to recover and reconnect to it. THE THERAPY The therapy Carty devises is essentially medicinal, with the tonic being an eclectic set of theoretical frameworks through which international law proper can be re found(ed). Typically, Carty does not systematically relate these frameworks to each other, nor are they necessarily compatible. They rather emerge from the dif ferent readings Carty has been inspired by. On the broadest level, the remedy against the Hobbesian/Vattellian plot consists of (re-)philosophising international affairs. This he understood already in Decay as 'the development of a method for valid, legitimate, or otherwise convincing argument'.42 He explains in Philo sophy that it means 'recognizing the inherence of an anthropology in the legal 41 See P.

Moving (Beyond) International Law discourse of international lawyers which needs to be brought to life and made to run (19). This is both a critical method aimed at exposing the irreality of the con cepts of modern international law, and a way of exploring the real' being of society and political community, and the law at its basis. As such, his call to phi losophise is no mere gesture to the importance of theory, but a substantive cure. Unlike Koskenniemi, Carty leaves the reader in no doubt that he believes that a real' international law is indeed out there, waiting to be found, if only (methodo logical) right reason were properly applied. While he shares with Koskenniemi the historical critique of the Vatellian conception and the role it has given to inter national lawyers, he radically differs on his vision of an alternative. For Kosken niemi, arguably the only cure can be the disease itself, which is why the agency of international lawyers is necessarily reduced to strategic intervention rather than containing a capability to originate an entirely alternative praxis. The viability of such an alternative praxis is produced through the dual nature of the international: it is, at once, an episteme mediated by language and a set of material circumstances. As language, it is amenable to interpretation, and thus to a plurality of meanings. As a set of material circumstances, it is rooted in the social and political reality' of the people inhabiting the world. The classical conception represents a distorted account of this reality' produced by the interpreters of its effects, notably international lawyers. It is hence up to these to pierce the veil of classical statehood and its law, and to chart what they find behind it. The method Carty proposes to achieve this is what he calls an ethnographic phenomenology of human conduct, whereby the place of language as an all-determining structure is accepted up to the point that our minute instances of surface consciousness, general social perspectives can be read' (17). This hermeneutic phenomenology is derived from Paul Ricoeur's reflection on recognition,43 which plays a central, if somewhat opaque, role in Carty s thought. In essence, Carty seeks to re-conceive the international as a space inhabited by cultural (and) historical communities' for whom the figure of the state is the institutional or procedural framework they give themselves for the conduct of their public affairs' (18). These communities are culturally incommensurate, and are themselves made up of distinct indivi duals in a continuous search for identity. They are engaged in continuous conflict and struggle, though this engagement does not, as in Hobbes, take the necessary form of enmity, but, on the contrary, of mutuality. This is so because, Ricoeur insists, there are shared moral motivations among all participants, motivations which inhere in the human person. Although these motivations are recognised as shared, the duality of capabilities and vulnerabilities that constitutes the self makes for a constant need to struggle. However, this is really a struggle against the misrecognition of others at the same time that it is a struggle for recognition of oneself by others.'44 What Carty takes from Ricoeur is the acceptance of the inherent conflictuality of human community and his simultaneous rejection of both the absence of recognition in Hobbes, and the cheap' recognition of a line of thought going from Hegel to Axel Honneth (225). Likewise, he credits 43 P. Ricoeur, Parcours de la reconnaissance: trois etudes (Paris: Gallimard, 2005). 44 From the English translation of the Parcours: The Course of Recognition (Harvard: Harvard University Press, D.

Hoffmann Ricoeur for providing 'the framework in which one can understand the ethnic nationalist and Marxist responses to the bourgeois capitalist Hobbesian state while retaining an overarching moral thread (225). In other words, Carty finds his Marxist analysis of imperialist statehood and his interest in the logic of self determination both compatible with and subsumed within Ricoeur s framework. He complements it, in typically eclectic manner, with other authors who have explored the irreducible solicitude of human beings, such as George Steiner in relation to (cultural) translation,45 or Barry Buzan with his idea of 'mature anar chy' based on reciprocity46 as well as James Der Derians analysis of the inherent alienation of states from each other,47 and Helmuth Plessner's concept of distance and tact48 What all of these point to is the fundamental solicitude of human beings, their opaqueness, and the need to work with rather than against this basic 'human condition. Law, in this scenario, is the medium through which mutuality through (diplomatic) tact is expressed in the form of reasoned (public) opinion by international lawyers, subject to mistakes and misjudgment or, rather, to the intransparency of the effects of agency. In this way, the Hobbesian order of fear may be replaced by an order of respect in which'tact in the face of perplexity has to take the place of fear in the face of the unknown and apparently threatening' (245). This is a complex medicine, with varied ingredients and diffuse effect. That is perhaps a reflection of Carty's daring to think differently: namely, a certain theo retical overstretch which gives him cover, not least by shrouding his actual posi tion in a thick theoretical haze. It is possible to read Carty in several different ways. As a Marxist sensitive to the class struggle and imperialism. As a descendant of the historical school of jurisprudence and its penchant for nationhood (and national ism?). As a legal 'hermeneut' and quasi-Dworkinian theorist of adjudication. Cer tainly not as a legal positivist, yet still as someone who deeply believes in the existence and relevance of law, and who continues to consider the concept of sta tehood as significant, if in a radically distinct manner from that of positivism. Perhaps, at the core of his thought is that tradition he acknowledges throughout the Philosophy as being at the heart of his project, namely natural law ? or, rather, (legal) humanism as it developed within the historical natural law tradition. Despite its frequent mention, it is never openly acknowledged as the medicine's active ingredient, and Carty somewhat mystifies its role in his theoretical frame work. Yet what he ultimately does, in so many words and through so many dis parate theoretical tools, is to reconstruct a naturalistic world view in which law primarily denotes a complex morality that inheres in human community and is subject to rational exploration. It denotes only secondarily 'positive' precepts meant to regulate human conduct according to that overarching morality. And it reserves for the lawyer the role of the public intellectual engaged in a continu 45 G.

Carty is very careful not to present this scheme in simplistic or potentially hegemonic terms, and he makes it clear that his insistence on an overarching morality that precedes legal relations (in Ricoeur's sense) is as averse to 'moralism as the more agnostic lines of thought he surrounds himself with. Yet ultimately it is this which distinguishes him from Koskenniemis strategic legalism and makes the Philosophy a truly bold venture with its motto: back to humanism. THE PATIENT DISCHARGED? So can the patient be discharged? Is this a viable and a compelling alternative to the classical conception? What is more, is it, in Koskenniemis sense,'progressive? It is more difficult to respond to these questions than Carty s concentrated, if somewhat breathless, argument would lead one to expect. Carty s humanism clearly places itself on the anti-formalist side of the paradigmatic divide, privile ging legitimacy over legality, with the former deriving from a contemplation of substance, not from a formal, that is, procedural or institutional, setup. This move away from formalism, whether classical or strategic, and towards substance is, to this reviewers mind, enlightened and fascinating. Yet at the same time, that very humanisms naturalistic shape means that Carty must continue to insist on a pri vileged role for law as a fact, albeit a complex one, to be properly discovered and interpreted by the interdisciplinary mindset of the humanist lawyer. Indeed, the lawyer continues to play a distinguished role, not unlike that played by the classi cal traditions 'independent expert' who is not a stakeholder of what s/he advises, but a mere commentator, a sage, akin to the litterarum alterum decus ac primae deliciae, the 'honour and delight of the world of letters',49 as exemplified by the humanist icon Erasmus of Rotterdam. Yet why is the figure of a privileged interpreter, whether sage or 'practitioner', necessary? On what grounds could s/he be removed from the fragility of the human condition, the experience of which Carty pre sents as a precondition for the recognition of the morality of mutuality? Is Carty s lawyer perhaps of a different kind and subject to a different law, more a priest ordained to act as persona Christi when administering the sacrament of the ius to an uninitiated laity? What is more, the apparent immanence of the ius naturale is mysterious. With Ricoeur, Carty sees the latter as pervading human relations, engendering the dip lomatic tactfulness that is the only legitimate way of engaging with others - human beings, communities, states ? as others. Yet where does it come from? Is it a logical postulate or an 'objective' empirical observation, arrived at through his method of ethnographic phenomenology? Insofar as it is decidedly not a mere effect of power, where does the authority of 'right reason come from? By choos ing Ricoeur over Habermas, he has precluded himself from a procedural and 49 The title was bestowed on Erasmus by John Calvin, in the dedicatory letter to Claude de Hangest in which he introduced his first published book, a commentary on Seneca's De dementia in 1532: see W. de Greef, The Writings of John Calvin: An Introductory Guide (Louisville: Westminster John Know Press, L. de Bierma trans, 2008). ? 2009 The Author.

Yet he seems unwilling openly to espouse a metaphysical one, thereby leaving the assertion of a natural law standing but there in the air, without authority and exposed to the potential ridicule of both the clacissists' and the crits' Does he not want (or is he unable) to make the final leap of faith? It is arguably only some form of faith which could bestow an author ity to this law that is capable of addressing the phenomenon of power in the world. Carty, as far as he goes in the Philosophy, largely dodges the question of power. He offers instead a theory in which power becomes miraculously dissolved into the respectful recognition of alterity and where the operators of Leviathan are transformed into gentlemen diplomats of independent disposition. Perhaps what ties Carty up is the futurist eschatology implicit in natural law theory: that is, the idea that the parousia, the coming of that which concludes the civitas homi num,50 is put off to a distant future, leaving it to human beings to build their city by following the precepts of a natural law which, ius-ex-rnachina, is revealed to and interpreted by the initiated. The result on the ground' is possibly quite indistin guishable from the managerialist problem-solving Koskenniemi bemoans and Carty does little to undermine with this long duree perspective. After all, within this world, the sage will eventually need institutions and procedures within which to make herself heard, and these will all too easily become petrified into the 'Law' and the 'Profession that Carty originally sets out to undermine. However, there is arguably the spark of a more radical vision contained in this humanism, one that dares make the leap of faith and that leaves the secure, if illu sory, ground of revealed universal morality. For the initial and crucial move of Protestant nominalism against Catholic realism was arguably the shift from a futurist to a presentist eschatology: that is, the idea that human community is conceived as if it were in the endgame.51 In this space between the us and the (O)ther, human agency is concentrated in the present. Absolved from the burden of the past and the future, it is purely relational and immanent, and in this sense fundamentally free.52 This is arguably the space of the political, as articulated by Hannah Arendt.53 Indeed, she represents an attempt to think politics as politics, rather than as an instrument for something outside of it. From an Arendtian per spective, (re-)politicising the 'law' cannot mean simply to use law as politics: that is, as a means to advance or achieve a certain objective, as arguably is the case with both Koskenniemi's culture of formalism and Carty's naturalistic humanism. For the grounds for that objective ? peace, social justice, environmental sustainability etc - are kept outside such apparent political action, mystified and out of the reach of public accountability and personal responsibility. What is more, by imbuing the 'law-as-given with political purpose or, rather, privileging it as a place for political action, one severely restricts the expressive space of the political, and, hence, of political action. For law, insofar as it is taken to be a transparent set of rules produced in a preordained way and backed by material sanction, is inher 50 See Augustine of Hippo, Concerning the City of God against the Pagans (London: Penguin Classics, H.

It subsumes', that is, forces, an (infinitely) complex reality' into generalised stylisations of substance and premises action on a particular causality. Law, in this sense, is the antithesis of the Arendtian freedom which characterises the political. Recovering that authentically political in world affairs' cannot, therefore, mean merely to squeeze a complex set of issues - Afghanistan, Iraq, North Korea, Palestine, Darfur, Geneva etc - into a legal iron cage in order to advance particular solutions.54 Nor can it mean to treat the values and aims of these solutions as pre political and to situate them either in the private choices of individual strategists, as Koskenniemi does, or in a presumed moral disposition shared by all, as with Carty. To Arendt, political action is both public and communal, non-instrumental and, literally, power-less. It is indeed a revolutionary moment that unfolds in the short space after one and before another law, when humans are radically thrown back to their own communal responsibility and when they have to found author ity, rather than rely on someone else's. It is a moment before the abyss when that ephemeral and, yet, so resilient (O)ther stands before the human condition. Per haps it is political action so conceived that lurks as the hidden essence behind Carty s humanism, as a way to account for the immeasurably complex and irre ducibly relational being of humans. 54 On whether Koskenniemi in particular proposes this or not, see J.
