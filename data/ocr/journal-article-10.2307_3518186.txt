<plain_text><page sequence="1">RATNABALI CHATTERJEE* Representation of Gender in Folk Paintings of Bengal There is a morality of the people understood as a determinate set of principles for practical conduct and of customs that derive from them or have produced them. Like superstition this morality is closely tied to religious beliefs. Yet this concept of morality is not unilinear. Within the complex strata exist the fossilized ones which reflect conditions of past life and are therefore conservative and reactionary and those which consist of a series of innovations often creative and progressive determined spontaneously by forms and conditions of life which are in the process of developing and which are in contradiction to the morality of the governing strata. [Gramsci, 1985] In the lived experience of the contemporary Bengali folk artist the mutually opposing strands of this morality run parallel, moulding and controlling his power of expression. On the one hand his depiction of religious myths holds him grounded in the static moral order of medieval times, on the other hand, his participation in the peasant struggle against colonial rule impels him to move away from the older narrative structure through formal and thematic innovations. It is in this context that we will attempt to study the folk artist's construction of the woman image which, more than any other, allows us to enter and analyze the schemea of his fractured perception. I The human form in Indian classical art is derived from a religious iconography. As cult goddesses, mother and consort, the female deities were easily identifiable to the viewers through the myths which upheld them. Nature provided the major metaphors for the structuring of an anthropomorphic form; both male and female images were conceived as participants in the mythic narratives. * Department of History Calcutta University, Calcutta. Social Scientist, Vol. 28, Nos. 3- 4, March-April 2000</page><page sequence="2">8 SOCIAL SCIENTIST The visual renditions of the Buddhist myths in Ajanta and Bagh serve as some of the best examples of the classical artistic formula. In the Ajanta murals the human figures press to the surface emerging with a dramatic force from the dark background as the narrative unfolds in a serialized fashion across the walls of the cave temples. Here, fantasy is wedged in with daily incidents, as familiar figures, landscapes and architecture situate the myth in the viewers' imagination as part of a lived experience. This classical formula finds an affirmation in the popular scroll paintings of Bengal. Here the images float up to the surface from a shallow background allowing human forms and mythic beings to be packed into a visual design through spatial adjustment. In both, the visual schema evolves slicing the picture space into separate units allowing the viewer to enter each specific incident of the story. While the Ajanta murals draw in the audience encompassing them in the procession of images, the scroll painting, monitored by the artist- narrator arranges a specific rhythmic entry for the viewer by the repeated motions of the rolling and unrolling of the painted scroll. Viewing the paintings forms a part of the ritual function which transforms the viewers into devotees. In contemporary Bengali paintings local cults replace the Buddhist myths. Most of these local deities originate from a pre-Brahmanical religious system and are rooted in the totemic functions of snake and tree worship. The narrative scheme adopted by the folk artists, however, spans the entire range of puranic contents, from which the oral and, later, written myths assume a specific form. Most of these folk deities came into prominence in the thirteenth century, when under the impact of Islam the moribund Hindu society took refuge in every kind of propitiating ritual to save itself from complete destitude. Interestingly, these cults were nurtured mostly by the lower orders of the Hindu society and by women in upper caste households. So from the beginning these folk deities remained outside the iconography of the official Brahmanical or Buddhist orders. The oral recitations which kept these local myths alive were found in the bratageet (ritual songs) sung by women mainly to ward off evil and ensure the well-being of the household. Another form of narration was through the panchali. These were recited by men in a social gathering usually after a day's work in the portals of the temple. The themes of the panchalis were derived mainly from the puranas and the epics. A syncretic characteristic was infused in them when, following historical demands, the Puranic Narayans,</page><page sequence="3">GENDER IN FOLK PAINTINGS OF BENGAL the Buddhist Sunya and the Islamic Pir merged into the icon of Satyanarayan. The ritual worship of this deity in Bengali Hindu families even today marks the continued popularity enjoyed by this cult. In the written form of Mangal Kavyas, these local myths assumed a definite literary importance after the advent of Vaishnavism in the fifteenth century and the subsequent growth of a vernacular Bhakti literature. These mythic tales were therefore brought before the Bengali audience continuously through daily rituals and subjected to constant re-interpretation at each historical moment of their lives (Bhattacharya, 1980). Literature speaks of bards carrying around scroll paintings from the first century onwards, and evidence of artistic schema datable from the same period can be found in the railing decorations of Bharhut and Sanchi. But no example of a painted scroll has been discovered in Bengal prior to the late eighteenth century. The persistence of this visual narrative schema, however, testifies to a collective artistic memory. Indian artists seemed to be engaged in perfecting a visual design through various experiments of space and volume to reach a comprehensive style in the Ajanta murals. The common central motif of a flowing river or winding road linking the separate incidents of the narrative also finds an echo in Rajasthani miniatures dealing with more secular themes. Here, as in the Bengali scroll paintings an element of humour is introduced through the quick juxtaposition of imaginary incidents with the actual. The visual narrative structure thus constructed allows what has been aptly described as a quick transcendental element of play implicit in folk culture to flourish alongside the grander manifestation of mythology.1 (Kapur, 1981) The woman image is constructed within this visual format in accordance with the historical needs of the artist-narrator. Both as the cult icon and as the main protagonist the feminine form is projected as the aesthetic core of the visual structure. To take an example, in the Manasa Mangal patas, the woman image is first projected as the cult goddess. As the scroll unfolds and the first scene is revealed one gazes in awe at the fearful visage of a woman crowned by a snake, seated on the throne made of coiled bodies and framed by an arc of hissing snake heads while the patua (the folk artist/singer) sings: Manasa hey jagat gouri jai bishahari Ashtam nager mathay parama sundari 9</page><page sequence="4">10 SOCIAL SCIENTIST [Hail to thee Manasas, the fairest in the worlds, glory to thee, conqueror of poisons. The great beauty sits on the hoods of eight snakes.] Even as the venomous snakes proclaim her power of destruction Manasa's smiling countenance assures the devout viewer of a benevolent protection. The perfection of her pliant form is recognized as a sign of her divinity, while her clothes, ornaments and gestures depicted in accordance with the canonical injunctions transform Manasa from a totem to a proper icon. The snakes emphasizing her inseparable association with a primitive cult, are here utilized to project an anthropomorphic form symbolizing both preservation and destruction. As the scroll unfolds further the singing artist shuts off the first scene by folding it in and the audience is faced with the familiar setting of a Bengali Zamindar's household. Chand, a merchant in the story, is presented here in the garb of a nineteenth century Bengali landlord. The architectural setting with its gothic pillars, stained glass windows and ornate Victorian chairs proclaim his social status. He represents that secular authority which is to be coerced and persuaded to bend to the divine will. But even as the rural audience recognize Chand's authority, a shift occurs in their perception as they incorporate the actual incidents of their daily life within the mythic formula. They now situate this myth within the specific historical period of colonial rule. With the slow repeated motion of rolling and unrolling the scroll, the artist-narrator relates the vengeance of the goddess who punishes Chand for refusing to pay her homage. One by one his sons are killed by snakes on their wedding nights and he is left with the sad sight of six widows. The folk artist by herding them together innovatively projects a single motif of misfortune. Chand's hopes are, however, revived through the birth of the seventh son Lakhindar. In the painting, the boy's small figure is flanked on both sides by the larger ones of his parents, as if a human barrier is constructed to protect this frail child. The narrative gathers momentum with Lakhindar's marriage to Behula. the singer goes on to relate how young Lakhindar and his bride are placed in a room of steel, how he falls a prey to Manasa's schemes and dies. Here the narrative takes on a dramatic turn as Behula unlike the other widows refuses to give up her dead husband; she now sets out on a journey towards the land of the gods to bring him back to life. As Behula's raft float down the swirling waters, the river perceived</page><page sequence="5">GENDER IN FOLK PAINTINGS OF BENGAL as a stream of life is projected by a central connecting design, incorporating through spatial adjustments a multitude of figures. The dramatic element of the narrative is highlighted through their interactions. The woman image as that of the main devotee assumes significance through her situation in the pictorial site. The erect sitting posture of Behula with the dead man on her lap is repeatedly placed in each separate pictorial unit. Her expression, at once sad and dignified, is invested with a spiritual meaning as the audience remembers the numerous anecdotes of women burning themselves on the funeral pyres of their husbands. In the major acts of the drama, Behula springs to action spurning the advances of the lecherous gout-ridden gods, warding off the shark, making her entry into the presence of the gods with the help of a woman called Neta. Yet within this spurt of movement the image of Behula is transfixed as a symbol of moral strength. She remains that chaste moral being who alone has the miraculous powers to bring back to life not only her dead husband but all the significant male members of the family who form her husband's Kula. This insistence upon lineage and family provides the ideological background to the formulation of Behula's gender identity. Visually, gender is structured through the depiction of clothes and gestures. Behula is usually presented in bridal red or in white sari with red border, her forehead and parted hair marked by vermilion. She can thus be recognized instantly as the 'wife' from the family of rural gentry. Here both class and gender are projected together through the visual construct of Behula's social image. In the last scene we have the unwilling Chand forced to pay homage to the victorious Manasa. The entire picture surface is now covered by the coiled figure of the snake. Within these undulating lines forming a decorative design are placed the seven boats, frail and puny, bringing back their cargo of dead men to the realm of the living. Against this background the iconic image of Manasa is presented as a symbol of cosmic energy containing both the powers of creation and destruction within herself. Behula as the chief agent of this divine will is entrusted with the task of upholding the moral order. Empowered by her chastity Behula, like the puranic Savitri, now claims a semi-divine status. Her departures from the usual social norms which hem in a Bengali housewife are approved in the narrative. Her ability to defend herself from dangerous beasts and lecherous men indicate her ability to step out of her gender roles of the dutiful daughter-in-law and the shy 11</page><page sequence="6">12 SOCIAL SCIENTIST newly-wed bride. Even her dance before the gods, the final act of departure from the social norms of the Bengali housewife, is valorized as the unusual act of a sati, so that the gender roles of the good wife and good daughter-in-law can be mytholigized in this single stereotyped image. Constructed as binary opposites to the devi (goddess) and sati (the chaste woman) are rakshsis (she demons) alakshmi and asati (the fallen women). These images of the 'other women' are also gleaned from the mythic narratives. Since Indian art has to deal mainly with the narration of supernatural events, the mythic characters are also invested with a great deal of versatility. Hence putana in Krishanaleela paintings, a demon who tried to kill the infant Krishna by suckling him at her breast, is transformed by this act into a bad mother who departs from the given role of the nurturer. Surpanakha is the other rakshasi whose demands on Rama and Lakshmana are presented as aggressively sexual. In contrast to the smooth pattern of flowing lines building the perfect feminine form of the goddess are the images of the demons. Both Putana and Surpanakha are portrayed through the depiction of huge female bodies with thrashing lines, their energies uncontained within a pliant feminine contour. These figures fill the pictorial frame and almost fall out of it; the anarchy in the visual structuring indicates the anarchy which their presence brings to the moral order. II The world order, structured by the contemporary Bengali patud is historically rooted in the nineteenth century. It rests on the relationship of the peasants and artisans with the landlord which in colonial India operated within the semi-feudal norms of domination and subordination. It has been aptly described as a relationship which derived its material sustenance from pre-capitalist conditions of production and its legitimacy from a traditional culture still paramount in the superstructure (Guha, 1983) The authority of the colonial state, by infusing new blood into the older existing landlord system through the permanent settlement, merely revitalized the quasi-feudal structure which prevailed in Bengal from the medieval period. the colonial state in order to facilitate the extraction of the peasant surplus perpetuated the zamindar's traditional rights to coerce even when they infringed on the governmental authority over criminal jurisdiction. The constant element in the peasant's relationship with the landlord therefore lay</page><page sequence="7">GENDER IN FOLK PAINTINGS OF BENGAL in the zamindar's continued powers to coerce and punish both as agent of the British and as upper caste member of the village panchayat. A flourishing land market which came into existence after the permanent settlement caused large scale peasant eviction and the pauperized peasants now turned more and more to landlords who had virtually become moneylenders. Thus in the perception of the rural artist and his audience the three agents of coercion were compounded in the person of the nineteenth century Bengali zamindar, who alone could be represented as the symbol of secular authority. Hence Chand, a merchant in the Manasa Mangal narrative, is portrayed as a nineteenth century Bengali zamindar in the scroll paintings. It is in reference to this concept of authority that the artist structures the woman-image as the upholder of the moral order and his own social role as that of the ideal subject. A clue to the patuas perception of self is to be found in the origin of their myth. While all artisans trace their origin to the Lord Viswakarma, the patuas lament that they were thrown out of the caste order due to a curse laid on their ancestors by an angry Shiva. Their acceptance of this outcast status logically follows from what Ranajit Guha describes as their subalternity whereby the peasant/ artisan learns to recognize himself through the identity imposed on him by the dominant class. The sum total of ruling ideologies expressed through religious myths re-enforces this subordinate position of the peasant by eulogizing loyalty and subservience to all authority, secular and religious, as a matter of spiritual commitment. (Guha, 1983) Contemporary research show that the patuas are now settled mainly in Medinipur and Birbhum districts of West Bengal. Though forced to move into diverse occupations they still have a preference for bardic narration and for the unusual occupations of snake - charmer or quack. This fits in with their roving tendencies, and their claims to the special position which they had traditionally enjoyed. The primitive equation of the artist with the magician seems to have held for the patuas long after the Brahmanical society had moved into complex religious rituals. (Bhattacharya, 1980) This firm entrenchment in the caste occupation contrasts sharply with their actual social position. Most of the patuas coming from Medinipur and Birbhum still bear two names, one Muslim and the other Hindu. Oscillating between these two religious cultures the patuas actually inhabit a twilight zone. Yet, simultaneously, his identity as an artisan or performer is defined by both religions in relation to 13</page><page sequence="8">14 SOCIAL SCIENTIST those of his patrons. This mythic order in which the patua situates himself as the ideal praja (subject) rests on three pillars: the cult deity, the secular authority (King or landlord), and the moral agent, often a woman as in the Mangal Kavyas. The rural artist by his own definition is the recipient subject, who flourishes in the region of the good king and suffers under an immoral one: Rajar papey rajya nashto, praja kashto pae. [The subjects and the kingdom suffer due to the sins of the king] In the consciousness of the rural artist this moral order breaks down in the nineteenth century as the colonial experience transforms the rural zamindar into a babu. This coincides with his own dislocation from the village to Calcutta's bazaars. The satirical Kalighat paintings, also known as the 'bazaar art' of Calcutta, visualized this disruption in their traditional occupational pattern. An apt literary description reflecting the ideological stance of the contemporary intelligentsia is to be found in the writings of Kaliprasanna Sinha. The Nawabi age disappeared like the winter's sunset while the power of the British increased as the released sun from behind the clouds... Nabo Munshi, Chhire merchant and Pute oil-maker became the Rajas,... Krishna Chandra, Rajballov, Man Singh, Nanda Kumar and Jagat Seth fell from grace and with them disappeared the Hindu religion, charity to the poor, the poet's honour, interest in learning and good plays, half akhrai, full akhrai, panchali and jatras came into being. The youth of the town are divided into different groups, Money has gained a higher status than aristocratic birth. (Sinha, 1991). The patuas coming to Calcutta during this period of transition absorbed the ideology of the dominant Hindu conservatives. They added their own social comments through the modification of a traditional art form which struck at the colonial roots of the new bourgeois culture. It, however, upheld most of the values which continued to be oppressive alike to the peasants and the rural artisans. On the basis of the Kalighat paintings reserved in various museums it is now generally accepted that as a particular artistic form it flourished in Calcutta between 1830 and 1930. After this the two last artists Nibaran Chandra Ghosh and Kalicharan Ghosh died and the form disappeared. While the first stylistic phase which began in 1830 shows an attempt at continuing the traditional form, Kalighat painting is known mainly through its break with the format of bardic narration and scroll paintings. Interestingly, this struggle to cling to a given</page><page sequence="9">GENDER IN FOLK PAINTINGS OF BENGAL artistic schema and at the same time bring about an innovation required for the depiction of the actual incidents, are best expressed in the Kalighat painter's projection of the woman image. A number of paintings known as rasaraj and rasamanjari form the first group. Here an attempt is made to link the forms to the medieval court paintings of nayaka-nayikabhed found profusely in Rajasthan. Common to both Kalighat painting and woodcut prints of the nineteenth century, we see these women figures, engaged in playing a musical instrument, smoking a hookah or holding a peacock. Their long ornamented robes, heavily bejewelled figures and graceful stance refer to the courtly tradition which was rigorously contained within an aesthetic code. In sharp contrast to these images are structured the images of shrews, be they prostitutes of wives; their aggressive sexuality expressed in terms of a voluptuous form. The common experience which the Kalighat painters was drawing upon also served for the satirical plays of the time known as prahasan. These were written, read, watched by a literate lower middle class, who are rarely mentioned in any study of nineteenth century Bengal. The similarity of the literary satires and the Kalighat paintings lay in focusing upon social incidents which had attracted recent popular attention. One such incident was the seduction by the Mohanto (religious chief) of Tarakeswar of a woman called Elokeshi. Elokeshi's husband Nabin lived in the city, and on his return home he became aware of the situation. The couple tried to run away but was thwarted by the Mohanto's men; in anger Nabin killed his wife and surrendered to the police. This resulted in implicating the Mohanto who was finally imprisoned. This theme was taken up by a number of writers of satires and lampoons. It was also taken up by the patuas. In the paintings the three incidents, of Elokeshi's meeting the Mohanto, of Elokeshi being murdered by Nabin and of the Mohanta serving his sentence in prison are carefully depicted. In the visual narrative the image of Elokeshi undergoes a change from the innocent victim of the early Kalighat painting to a coy seductive woman in the later works. While the viewer's sympathy for Nabin as the wronged husband remains to the last, this slight shift in the focusing of the story gives an index into the patuas ideology. With the entrenchment of colonial rule in nineteenth century Bengal the dominant social code embodied in the Manu Smriti continued to be, as it had been from the medieval times, the most important frame of reference for Hindu social relations of authority where men were granted a commanding position over women as 15</page><page sequence="10">16 SOCIAL SCIENTIST fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons. Without any hope of independence the women were mainly to be treated as necessary evils, for Manu warned that given the slightest indulgence her sexual appetite, always insatiable, will devour the man. This view of woman was internalized by the popular artists: in both popular literature and popular art of the period, women were used as images to project the 'other' of man. Kalighat artists, by reversing the moral order, introduced an element of satire against the society which was denying them their subsistence. So in a number of paintings (the babu patas) we see men servile before women, sitting at her feet massaging her feet, bowing before women, sitting at her feet massaging her feet, bowing before her, while the woman, large and obese, is chastising him or even trampling on him in a gesture of rejection. The women in these paintings have been denied that tender grace which a secure feudal order, keeping the woman contained within its male-dominated enclosure, could bestow on them. The energy which the smoothly flowing lines of Kalighat painting enclosed in the female form was not released for the erotic gratification of men; here they were often used to project a reserved situation. The woman in her sexual aggression became a punisher. Her physical strength provides a contrast to the man's weakness. In painting after painting of the fallen babus, we see the logic of the reversed world order gaining ground, as the erotic is transformed into the obscene. (Chatterjee, 1990) This reversed world order is best expressed in the structuring of an iconography of Koli Kal or Ghor Koli. In the Hindu mythic concept of time Koli Kal comes last. It is the period when men are steeped in sin, when the low born acquire power over Brahmans and women dominate men. The rural artisan, feeling totally alienated in Calcutta, devised a visual design of this Koli Kal. The painting shows a man leading by a halter around her neck a devout old woman. The bent figure with her sandalwood paste mark and the rosary bag is undoubtedly able to arouse the viewer's sympathy. On the man's shoulder sits a bejewelled young woman holding a parrot. With his right hand the man holds her feet steadying her. The woman resting on his shoulder is his wife, while the woman being led by a rope around her neck is the mother. Through these image are recreated not only the fall of the babu, i.e. the lost patron, but the breakdown of all authoritarian structures, the parent and the child, the man and the woman, the guru and the disciple. Through the three-tier division of space where the woman with the parrot rides high art tradition where the presence of the man determines the woman's sexual role.</page><page sequence="11">GENDER IN FOLK PAINTINGS OF BENGAL In a period of transition, a social order can break down, rupturing the hierarchical relations which forms its core. When this happens, the breakdown of any one of its elements can serve in art as its major metaphor. In nineteenth century Bengal the crisis in the arts was created by the reappraisal of the new middle class of its indigenous culture. The colonial education which declared this to be inadequate urged them to social reforms. While this broke down the traditional patron-client relationship existing between the patuas and their landlords or babus, it also impinged on interpersonal relations within the family. Women were now granted a presence in public debates unprecedented in Indian history. But the marginalized patua using his own self perception as an index for the structuring of a new women- image, merely saw her as an agent of destruction. Rajar papey rajya nashto praja kashto pae ar ginnir papey gerasti nashto gharer lakshmi urey jae. [The subjects suffer due to the sins of the king but the household is destroyed due to the sins of the housewife as Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth leaves the hearth.] III A shift occurs in popular perception when the peasant turns into a rebel. His actual experience helps him to locate the oppressors and build, what Gramsci has termed a 'counter-ideology to destroy the ruling class's hegemony'. The process through which the peasant and artisan are able to formulate their counter-ideology is certainly not unilinear and even in historical moments of rebellion, the peasants often hark back to older social sanctions of religion. In the Saheb patas from Medinipur, the oppressors are rightly located as the British police, the planters and the comprador zamindars. The narrative now moves to the usual serialized motion, but here the human images no longer assume a mythic form. The clothes, gestures and particularly the image of the peasant rebel assumes a realistic significance which refers to the lived experience rather than the fantasies of a mythic world. The narrative progresses by discarding the earlier logic of a tripartite power structure and the heroes no longer lay claim to supernatural agency. A feeling of solidarity operates between the rebels and the rural artists as they recognize the legitimate demands of the peasants of their own land. In the Santhal Bidroha Patas the patua approvingly upholds the tribals' rights as the just demands of a good people: Santhaira baro bhalo ohash bash niye chhilo 17</page><page sequence="12">18 SOCIAL SCIENTIST ar Sahebra eshey tader jami kere rulo [The Santhals were good people who lived by cultivating their land, but the white men came and took it away]. In the context of the patuas earlier relations with the Santhals, this representation of the Santhal rebellion points to a new awareness of self and community. The patuas even today act as priests for the Santhals. Whenever one of them dies the patuas come and persuade the relatives to have the dead person's portrait drawn. Then they coax the family to have the eyes put in the portraits, in exchange or rice, vegetables and metal utensil, the argument being that the dead relative was roaming round blindly and would proceed straight to heaven after gaining his/her sight. Perceived from a Brahmanical stance, this is an act whereby the patua is recruiting the tribal into the Brahmanical system. Looked at from the tribals point of view this is a subversive act through which the Santhals are being brought under a form of systematized exploitation. In the representation of the rebellion, the rural artists provide a sympathetic rendition, projecting Kanu and Sidhu as immortal heroes. While the final scene shows the death of the rebel leaders and the torture of the people following the failure of the rebellion, the artists valorize Sidhu and Kanu as martyrs, and realistically project this tragedy as a defeat for the entire peasantry. Interestingly enough, it is in these paintings of rebellions that we see the artist's attempt to structure an alternative woman image. In these paintings she is the rebel partner and hence present in the public space. The artist deliberately removes her shackles, so that she is free of the mother daughter roles played out by women at home. Here participation in the rebellion offers her the exit points from the hitherto stereotyped roles so long thrust upon women. It is tempting to read in these visual renditions of the rebellions a greater revolutionary project than is obviously apparent, but this would merely divert our attention from those links that still exist between the dominant and popular ideologies. The artist-narrator of these paintings when speaking of the revolutionary woman used the metaphors of 'brave mother', 'brave sister' and 'brave wife' so that the women in these texts are once again deified as birangands. The centrality of the woman-question in the nationalist discourse pointed out by contemporary research (Sarkar, 1985) opens up new readings of the representations of women figures like Matangini Hazra in the</page><page sequence="13">GENDER IN FOLK PAINTINGS OF BENGAL scrolls. The patuas refer to her as a freedom fighter who not only took up the cause of the peasants but organized women who came out of their kitchens and participated in political meetings and marches. One should note that the scrolls still retaining the visual narrative schema are divided into separate pictorial units. In the first scene where there used to be the cult image of the god-goddess is now placed a huge national symbol of the three Asokan lions, while form the sides, rushing to the centre Matangini Hazra appears dramatically, her white sari billowing behind, a white cap on her head, one hand holding the national flag, the other raised in a closed fist of protest. The patua now sings- Prati gramey giye Matangini bolite lagilo/gramer meyeder Matangini jaro je korilo/bolite lagilo, amra bideshi jinish chhobona/Amra suto kattbo/nijeder kapor boonbo/amader desher jinish amra vyabahar koorbo. [Matangini went to every village, she brought out the women, she told them we will not dress like foreigners, we shall spin our own cloths, we shall make our own cloths, we shall only use the goods of our country.] In the climax of this narrative Matangini is shown demonstrating before the Magistrate's gate, while a huge crowd, mostly of women, follow her. The patua, however, relates her sufferings; how the British officer ordered the police to shoot, so that she first lost her arms, then her voice. But before she died, she prophesied that she would be born again and when India is independent in each home there will be born a Matangini. In the words of the song more than the visuals we hear the resonance of the voice of other martyrs, like Khudiram who had also promised to be born again in an independent India (The Khudiram song was extremely popular even in the villages). By equating Matangini with the male martyrs the rural artists have here accorded her a public space. She is now freed from the role of the chaste woman who is empowered like Behula by her ties with her family and her sati status to step out of the confines of the gerasti (household) which creates an inner sanctum for the colonized male within the home. Matangini is released from this structure; in fact, she transforms this home into private space projecting them as equals of men. It is here that we find a new construction in the woman-image. But unfortunately the patua's perception is not completely riveted to this new image of woman altering his semi-feudal perspective. So he returns to a contemporary version of the Koli Kal patas. 19</page><page sequence="14">20 SOCIAL SCIENTIST The myth of Kaliyuga mainly structured in the epics expressed the male anxieties of the period. Textually the Kaliyuga or the period of moral doom is supposed to have begun soon after the Mahabharata war, when existing power relations were subverted. The mlechha alien rulers replaced the rightful kings, shudras appropriated the authority of the Brahmans and most important of all, sexually deviant women wielded power over men. In the popular paintings of Bengal, the central image is of the deviant woman. Continued from the nineteenth century the images of sexually aggressive women are depicted as wearing revealing clothes and indulging in exaggerated gestures. The narrative related through certain incidents serializes these figures, situating them in different scenes. The blown up figures of the deviant woman contrasts sharply with male figures of husbands and fathers wedged into the crowded picture space. Even when depicted as men of authority the male characters appear secondary in the drama which unfolds before us. The narrative of moral doom in contemporary scrolls refer to present day social scene affecting women - divorce, remarriage, women having multiple sexual partners even when she has a husband, and women shunning domesticity. The peak of the narrative is structured through scenes of revelry as women are seen rushing to the cinema hall. As the picture space gets crowded by images of women on cycles, packed in autos, vans, falling out of crowded buses, a humorous note is struck by the artist. With the recognition by the audience of the images and the events depicted, the artist is able to contextualize the painting within the scheme of daily existence. The narrator's voice at once morally indignant and satirical relates how the modern woman shuns her traditional role. Today's women, the bard tells us, marry as soon as their husbands die, even an old woman these days demand a young and handsome lover. Clearly the roles are reversed. The painting assumes a special significance when placed in the perspective of nineteenth century male projects of reform; the latter had, in fact, placed abolition of Kulin polygamy and widow remarriage in the centre of their demands. The final scene shows a woman wearing a sleeveless blouse and high heeled shoes looking over her shoulder at the trailing group of men following her to the cinema hall. The chaos left behind is depicted through images of crying children and old mother-in-law carrying on the household chores and a gaping husband staring at the departing figure of his spouse. With the suggestion of the cinema hall as the centre of moral doom the artist communicates to the audience his</page><page sequence="15">GENDER IN FOLK PAINTINGS OF BENGAL views on the media that has robbed him of his daily bread. The audience's expectation is fulfilled as humour is used as a weapon by the frustrated patuas who retreat to the shelters of moral values stemming from a medieval past. The patua allowing the images of a reversed world order to once again gain ground, projects the typical patriarchal norms and their deeply ingrained hegemony. Men in the scheme of the patuas are always protected by the sati or punished and subjugated by the asati. To both he denies human identity. [The contemporary scroll paintings discussed are the works of patuas from Medinipur. The Manasa Pata is the work of Bahar Chitrakara who is also known as Ranjit Chitrakara.] NOTES 1.
