LUCE, Editor-in-Charge Fogg Museum of Art, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. NECROLOGY Sir Aurel Stein. - We are deeply indebted to the Royal Central Asian Society for its courtesy and co-operation in sending us, through the good offices of Mr. Carl T. Keller of Boston, a member both of the Society and of the Institute, advance page proofs of the obituary written by its Hon. Secretary, GENERAL SIR PERCY M. SYKES, to appear in the Royal Central Asian Journal. As no tribute to his memory could be more complete and appreciative, we are taking the liberty of printing it in full. Sir Aurel's association with archaeological work in America is evidenced by his connection with the Fogg Museum of Harvard University, and the numerous friendships he had with American Orientalists. Besides our debt of gratitude to Sir Percy Sykes, who personally sent the proof sheets, we wish to express our thanks to Mr. Langdon Warner of Harvard University, and particularly to Mr. Keller, through whose efforts this tribute was secured. S. B. L. The death of Sir Aurel Stein, at the ripe age of eighty, removes from the Central Asian scene one of the last of the great student-explorers who have written Finis on the exploration of the world in its widest sense. Of Jewish descent, he was born in Hungary, and was educated at Budapest, at Dresden and at the Univer- sities of Vienna and Tiibingen. In 1885 he came to London in order to pursue his study of Oriental lan- guages and antiquities. He had from the first been inspired by the ambition to penetrate into the heart of Asia which, at that time, was almost a terra incognita. In London he met Sir Henry Rawlinson and Sir Henry Yule, the greatest figures of that period in the field of scientific exploration, and received from them fresh inspiration for the project he had at heart. Appointed Principal of the Oriental College at Lahore, Stein at once grasped the opportunity to equip himself for his great career, alike by study and by field- work in Kashmir and on the Northwest Frontier. Those who knew him at that time were impressed not only with his intense absorption in the field he had chosen for his life's work, but by the determination with which he sought from the authorities in India and Eng- land the necessary assistance in carrying out the scheme of exploration he set before them. In 1900 his efforts were successful, and he was given the mission of explor- ing the sand-buried ruins of Khotan in distant Chinese Turkestan. Many years later, the aged British Agent at that city told me that he had purchased manuscripts and other treasures from these areas, which had been deserted owing to the failure of the rivers to reach them with their life-giving water. These finds the Agent had sent to his brother at Leh, whence they had reached the Museum at Calcutta. There Stein had seen them, and had realized their immense importance. This, his first expedition, was conspicuously successful. In his second expedition of 1906-1908, sanction for which he had gained with the same indefatigable deter- mination, Stein traversed Chinese Turkestan and crossed the dreaded Gobi Desert to the borders of Western China and Tibet. Here he secured results of great historical importance by the discovery of the ancient Chinese fortified wall, which he followed for some 9200 miles. He also gained access to, and possession of, a great deposit of ancient manuscripts and art relics. Unfortunately, in the ascent of a mountain in Tibet, which rose to an altitude of 90,000 feet, he suffered from frostbite, and finally the toes of his right foot had to be amputated. Stein's reputation was now assured, and among the awards which he especially valued was the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. Some years later he was honoured by the award of the K.C.I.E. In 1919 Stein started on the third of his great jour- neys. After further exploration in Western China he stayed with me at Kashgar, where I was acting as Consul-General, and, later, I met him on the Pamirs. This journey, the longest he undertook and geographi- cally perhaps the most important, lay through the trans- Oxus provinces which had been surrendered to Russia some years previously by the Amir Abdur Rahman and were little known. From Russian Turkestan Stein entered Persia, and after discovering valuable frescoes in historical Sistan, he finally reached Quetta, thereby accomplishing a journey of some 11,000 miles. His archaeological collections, most of which I had des- patched for him from Kasgar, filled 182 cases. A few years later Stein identified the fortress of Aornos in the Swat Valley. This, the site of a famous 178</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 179 feat accomplished by Alexander the Great, had deeply interested the late Sir Thomas Holdich and many frontier officers, but at that period the area was strictly "out of bounds." I recollect Stein telling me that this discovery was the one that was nearest to his heart. Yet it would perhaps be true to say that for him his last important discovery eclipsed even the identification of the Aornos. In the seventh century of our era, the famous Chinese traveller Hsuan-tsang, in the classic record of his long journey, described his adventurous march down the gorges of the Indus. To quote his description: "The roads were very dangerous and the valleys gloomy. Sometimes one had to cross on rope bridges, sometimes clinging to chains." It might well have been thought that an explorer approaching eighty years of age, with the toes of one foot lacking, would have hesitated to travel by "the Route of Chains." But, indomitable as ever, Stein was determined to follow in the footsteps of one whom he was wont to describe as "his Chinese Patron Saint," and his success- ful accomplishment of this feat was, as might well be imagined, intensely gratifying to him. As one who has learned much from him personally and from his invaluable publications, and who has travelled widely in some of the countries he explored, it is my definite opinion that Stein undoubtedly ranks among the greatest explorers of all time. He brought to his task not only a unique equipment of historical and archaeological knowledge, but a systematic and scientific method of approach, which enabled him to overcome the physical obstacles of travel, and gave a unique value to his record of the results. But this is not all. With unfailing resolution he combined also a tact which greatly smoothed his path in dealing with Oriental authorities, and a simplicity of character which will leave an enduring memory in the hearts of his many friends. But, in their regret for his loss, they have at least the solace of reflecting that his end was one which he might well have chosen for himself. They know of his lifelong desire to be permitted to carry out explora- tion in Afghanistan-a desire which had more than once been frustrated when it seemed that he was about to achieve it. When at last the chance presented itself he set out immediately for Kabul. His death there cut short his project, but as he himself said in a parting message to a friend, he "had had a wonderful life and it could not have been more happily concluded than in Afghanistan." FINIS CORONAT OPUS. P. M. SYKES Ernest J. H. Mackay.- An obituary of this versatile archaeologist appears in BMFA. xli, 1943, p. 76. Born in 1880, he died at his home in England on October 2, 1943. His archaeological work began in Egypt in 1907, where he was active in the field until 1916. After service in the British Army during the First World War, he went to Palestine in 1919 as Custodian of Antiquities for the Palestine Government, where he remained till 1922. From that year till 19~6 he was in charge of the Field Museum and Oxford expedition to Mesopotamia. In 1935-36, under the auspices of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the American School of Indic and Iranian Studies, he directed excavations at Chanhu-Daro in the Indus valley, a site dating from the third millen- nium B.C. His discovery of an engraved shell in his work in India led to the suggestion that the decimal system may have originated there. Gustave Adolphus Harrer.-CJ. xxxix, pp. 323-3!5, prints an obituary of this eminent Latinist by J. PENROSE HARLAND. In the archaeo- logical field he was best known for his work in Latin epigraphy, and his doctoral dissertation, Studies in the Roman Province of Syria. Born in Brooklyn, N. Y., on May 14, 1886, he was graduated from Princeton in the Class of 1910, and received his Ph.D. degree from the same University in 1913. In 1915 he went to the University of North Carolina, and remained there till his death on November 26, 1943, except for the year 1922-23, when he went to the American Academy at Rome for a year of study. His best work was as a teacher, and many pupils of his graduate courses all over the country owe their competence to his training. Arthur Fairbanks was born at Hanover, New Hampshire, November 13, 1864, and died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, January 13, 1944. A graduate of Dartmouth College in the Class of 1886, he later studied at the Yale Divinity School, the Union Theological Seminary and the Univer- sity of Berlin, and took his Doctor's degree at Freiburg-in-Breisgau in 1890. Except for the year 1898-1899, when he was a Fellow of the American School at Athens, he taught from 1890 to 1907 at Dartmouth, Yale, Cornell, the University of Iowa and the University of Michigan, in the two latter posts as Professor of Greek Literature and Archaeology. From 1907 to 19~5 he was Director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachu- setts, and after his retirement from this position served for five years as Professor of Fine Arts at Dartmouth College. The breadth of Fairbanks' interests is apparent in his published works, which include: Introduc- tion to Sociology, 1896 (second edition, 1901); The First Philosophers of Greece, 1898; A Study of the Greek Paean, 1900; The Mythology of Greece and Rome, 1907; A Handbook of Greek Religion, 1910; Greek Gods and Heroes, 1915; Greek Art, the Basis of Modern European Art, 1933; as well as</page><page sequence="3">180 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY translations of Riehl's Introduction to the Theory of Science and Metaphysics, 1894, and Philostra- tus' Imagines, 1931. In the field of archaeology, his most important contributions are two volumes on the Athenian White Lekythoi (1907, 1914) and the first volume of the Catalogue of Greek and Etruscan Vases in the Museum of Fine Arts (1928). To a wide acquaintance with the literature and monuments of ancient Greece and Rome, Fair- banks brought the added insight which came from his early interest in sociology and religion. Among his younger colleagues he will be remem- bered as one who was always ready to share his knowledge and to help them with their problems. GEORGE H. CHASE A brief tribute to Dr. Fairbanks will also be found in BMFA. xlii, 1944, p. 20, and on the same page will also be found an obituary of Charles H. Hawes, Assistant and Associate Director under Dr. Fairbanks, who died on December 13, 1943, exactly one month to a day before Dr. Fairbanks. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS New Journal. - We welcome a new journal to the numismatic field, the Numismatic Review, a Scientific Digest pertaining to Coins, Medals, and Paper Money, published quarterly, at 12 West Forty-sixth Street, New York 19, New York. The Editor is Thomas Ollive Mabbott, already widely known in numismatic circles, and the Associate Editor, Hans Holzer. Agnes Baldwin Brett heads an impressive list of Advisers. The new periodical, as its Editor states in his salutatory preface, sets out to provide "a channel for the publication of serious and authoritative articles by specialists in every field. It is not our purpose to rival or supplant other periodicals, but while taking all matters of numismatic in- terest for our field to devote our pages mainly to what other periodicals at present do not cover, or cover only incidentally. In some senses it is hoped to revive some of the virtues of the old American Journal of Numismatics." A glance at the Table of Contents of Vol. 1, No. 1, June 1943, reveals the following articles of interest to the classical numismatist: AGNES BALDWIN BRETT writes on Philip of Macedon's race horse, winner at the Olympic Games, 356. This is the horse depicted on the silver staters issued by Philip. EARLE R. CALEY discusses the earliest use of nickel alloys in coinage, reviewing the results obtained 75 years ago by the English chemist, Dr. Flight, with the analysis of certain coins of Bactria, and contributing the results of certain investigations of his own on other Greek coins with nickel and copper content. ANNALINA C. LEVI shows the dependence of Roman minor arts, e.g., the making of cistae, cake moulds, lamps, jewelry, et cetera, on con- temporary coin types. HANs HOLZER contributes a Numismatic History of Karnuntum, a city on the Danube in Pannonia, that reached its height of importance in 260 A.D. He has done an excellent piece of work. There are also articles of varied interest and importance in other fields. Of outstanding value is Rentzmann's Numismatisches Legenden-Lexikon (1865 and 1878), translated and brought up to date. This Lexikon gives the names of the rulers of the Western World during the Middle Ages up to the present time. It will appear in the Numis- matic Review in several instalments. Dr. Mabbott is to be congratulated on his new venture. In the words of the Greek blessing in- voked upon infant children, "May it live!" Cambridge. - In AJ. xxiii, 1943, pp. 34-41, D. H. S. FRERE describes flints, molluscs, bones and pottery of the late Neolithic period found three miles south of Cambridge. The pottery is Grooved Ware similar to that of Clacton. Of interest are the shell fragments used in the clay as backing or as grit. Brochs.-In AJ. xxiii, 1943, pp. 19-25, A. GRAHAM lists 503 brochs and broch sites in Shet- land, Orkney, Northern Mainland, West Coast, Inner Islands, Outer Islands and Central and Eastern Mainland. 305 of these are still in existence. The Elephant in Ancient War. - In CJ. xxxix, pp. 257-269, RICHARD GLOVER has a very interest- ing paper discussing the use of the elephant by the armies of the Hellenistic Greeks, the Carthagin- ians, and the Romans. The first battle in which superiority in elephants won the day was that of Ipsus in 302 B.C. From that time on, until the middle of the first century B.C., the elephant be- came one of the regular arms of Mediterranean war. His function was not, as many commenta- tors suggest, allied to that of the tank today, but rather as a form of heavier shock cavalry - his shock value was far more powerful than that of the horse, and he had important weapons of his own in his heavy feet and tusks. Sometimes he carried armed riders in a howdah (or "tower" as</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 181 the ancients called it), but more often he just had a mahout or driver to guide him into battle. The elephants of Carthage do not seem to have had towers. The defeat of Regulus by the Carthagin- ians in 225 B.C. in which the elephants were in charge of a Spartan mercenary, Xanthippus, was the most costly ever due to elephants - only 2,000 Romans escaped. The best generals always employed elephants in mass formation, in the center if they had a large number, otherwise on one or both flanks; their distribution was costly to their employers as it deprived them of their shock value. The weakness of elephants as an offensive weapon was that they could not be engaged against an entrenched enemy, and that, when wounded, they were apt to stampede to the rear and destroy the troops of their own side. Incidents of victories of troops without them over enemies supplied with them are those of Alexander the Great on the Hydaspes, and Scipio over Hannibal at Zama; and yet, owing to their in- grained conservatism, the Romans did not adopt elephants as weapons of war until after that battle, and never showed much interest in them. The Indian elephant was considered superior to the African, owing to his short, thick legs and more compact and powerful frame. In every case, however, the mahouts appear to have been of Indian stock. The Illyrian Language. - Harv. St. liii, 194 2, prints a summary of a doctoral dissertation on this subject by PAUL ROBERT MURPHY. Our knowledge is based on one inscription, and a number of personal and local names, and the language has never received a really compre- hensive treatment. It would appear to have some relation to the Messapic and Venetic languages, and comparisons of vowel and consonant pro- nunciations are given. Finally, the author adds a few new words to the thesaurus of Illyrian and its dialects. EGYPT Egyptian Portraiture.- Dows DUNHAM con- tributes to BMFA. xli, 1943, pp. 68-72 (8 figs.) a discussion of portraiture in the Old Kingdom, illustrated by examples in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He believes that perhaps the best way to understand the "social background, and the physical and psychological environment of the Egyptians who lived when the Pyramids were new" is by this means, as in the Old Kingdom Egyptian art was relatively un- affected by external influences. But whereas portraiture today is addressed to others than the person portrayed, in that period it was primarily addressed to the subject, and went into his tomb with him. In every case, it was intended to be a true likeness. It is pointed out that "the great works by which Egyptian art should be judged are rare " and that a useful purpose may be served by singling out some of the best portraits that have come down to us to show what the Egyptian portrait sculptor was capable of achiev- ing. All the objects here published belong to the Fourth Dynasty (2680-2560 B.C.) and fall into two groups; first, private individuals, high of- ficials, or princes, and second, kings and queens. Of the first class, five examples are shown, the most interesting being the famous bust of Ankh- haif, which Dunham considers "the supreme example of realistic portraiture which has sur- vived from Egypt." Of the second group, all objects illustrated are statues of Mycerinus, and the artist sought to blend the human with the divine, as the king was regarded not as a man like other mortals, but as a god, who, living for a time on earth, passed at death into the company of the other gods. Of this attempt to blend these two conceptions, the colossal alabaster statue of Mycerinus in the Museum is perhaps one of the most successful; while the famous statue of this ruler, with his queen, made when the king was more advanced in years, is also remarkable for suggesting this same idea, and for the superb quality of the queen's face, embodying the Egyptian ideal of feminine beauty and dignity. MESOPOTAMIA Oriental Seals in Toronto. - The collection of ancient oriental seals in the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology in Toronto is very representative, with examples ranging from Jemdat Nasr times (ca. 3400 to ca. 3000 B.C.) down to the late Arab period. Most of the seals were purchased from dealers at various times and places; the provenance is therefore unknown, and they can be dated only by comparison with seals of known date. The 85 seals, including a dozen forgeries, are published by THEOPHILE JAMES MEEK in Berytus viii, 1943, pp. 1-16. Photo- graphs of the actual size of the seal impressions are given in each case, and in addition twelve of the seals are enlarged by a new process: moulds are made in liquid latex rubber, and are then en- larged to approximately twice the original size by</page><page sequence="5">182 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY immersion in kerosene, thus bringing out details far more satisfactorily than can be done by en- larging photographs. Tell al-'Uqair. - SETON LLOYD discusses in PEQ., July-Oct., 1943, the excavations which were made at Tell al-'Uqair in the years 1940-41; this site is located a little to the north of Kutha. At that place there was unearthed a prehistoric temple of the Uruk period (ca. 3800 B.C.). It stood on a high D-shaped platform. Four of the surviv- ing chambers and more than half of the central hall had their walls ornamented with brightly colored frescoes. Both temple and platform were built of rectangular sun-dried bricks; the faqades of both were ornamented with alternate but- tresses and recesses. The frescoes were painted in several colors on the soft mud-plaster of the interior faces, with a preliminary ground work of white. It is very difficult to recover more than a limited number of the designs, since the whole building had been filled in solid with heavy brick work to make a foundation for a new temple. Adjoining the platform on one side was dis- covered a subsidiary chapel of the Jemdet Nasr period. At another part of the site were excavated buildings of sun-dried brick of the al-'Ubaid period, and here was obtained south Iraq painted ware with fine conventionalized pictures of ani- mals and birds. In an addendum to the article S. W. PEROWNE notes that the temple at Tell al-'Uqair bears a striking resemblance to that of Beihan in the Aden Protectorate; this latter structure is built of stone and may be based upon a brick original of the type of temple at Tell al-'Uqair. Perowne in 1940 saw the remains of exactly similar buildings unearthed at Axum in Ethiopia. The earliest known date for the Beihan temple is its restoration by King Shahr Geilan ca. 900 B.C. Perowne concludes: "Is it possible that we have in the Beihan temple another link with the Mesopota- mian and Southern Arabian cultures?" Dura-Europos.- The recently discovered tri- lingual inscription of Shapuhr I is an important addition to the relatively scanty sources for the history of the Roman Empire in the mid-third century. It gives a brief summary of the political, religious, and military activities of the Sassanian king, and has aptly been called the Res Gestae Divi Saporis. The military section records only three episodes in his long struggle with the Romans: (1) a victory over the army of Gordian III and subsequent treaty with Philip (A.D. 244), (2) his first invasion of Syria and Asia Minor, and (3) his victory over Valerian at Edessa, his capture of the Roman Emperor, and the following invasion of Asia Minor (A.D. 259/60). The first and third of these campaigns can be identified with the help of other sources. The second is more difficult to identify and date, and is the subject of a long and important study by MICHAEL I. ROSTOVTZEFF in Berytus viii, 1943, pp. 17-60. Shapuhr speaks of defeating a Roman army at Barbalissus (a battle not otherwise re- corded), and then lists the cities of Syria, plus a few in Cappadocia, which he sacked. The list includes Antioch and Dura, but not Hemesa; from it, it is possible to trace the course of the military operations, and it is evident that the campaign was a hurried one, conducted for prestige and booty, with no time for lengthy sieges. The raid came, not from northern Mesopo- tamia, as was the case in 260, but from the south, up the right bank of the Euphrates. The only literary accounts which help in plac- ing this first invasion are those which were written by Syrians or which seem to depend on Syrian sources; the most important are Oracula Sibyllina xiii, Zosimus, and Malalas, and even here the narrative is confused and at times contradictory. However, a number of coincidences with places or events mentioned in the inscription make it possible to disentangle the story and to place the invasion and the first capture by the Persians of proud Antioch in the year 253 and before the accession of Valerian. In the general history of the Roman Empire, the events of 259/60 were far more important, and it is not surprising that other and summary historians say not a word which can be referred to the first invasion. The "Syrian " group of writers, however, were tremendously impressed by the first capture of Antioch, more than by the later defeat at Edessa and its after- math-the writer of the Oracula Sibyllina xiii does not even allude to the capture of Valerian! At the same time, Syria was not hostile to Rome, and hence the Roman defeat at Barbalissus was, tactfully, not recorded, though without it the invasion of Syria would not have been possible. This parochial interest accounts also for the stress laid on the stories of Mareades, the traitor of Antioch, and of Sampsiceramus, who frustrated Shapuhr in his attack on Hemesa (in Shapuhr's list of cities taken, Hemesa is significantly missing). Briefly, the course of events may now be sum- marized as follows. During the reign of Philip,</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 183 there were no military operations in Syria or Mesopotamia. In 952 Shapuhr moved against Nisibis, but was unable to make progress in that quarter, and so attacked Syria in the next year by the Euphrates road. When the Roman army was defeated at Barbalissus, there was no way of preventing the invasion of Syria, and it is probable that the garrison of Dura withdrew to the more strongly held left bank of the Euphrates. Still Shapuhr had no time to waste in sieges, and the cities he took he plundered but did not occupy. Late in 953 or early in 954 Valerian arrived and restored order. Probably in 256 Shapuhr moved again and after a siege took Dura, but was repulsed by Valerian (witness the title Parthicus which Valerian assumed in 957). Then came the momentous happenings of 259/60, the defeat of the Romans, the capture of Valerian, and the emergence of Odenath, prince of Palmyra, as the Syrian hero. What of the numismatic and archaeological evidence for this reconstruction? Because in 258/9 the operations of the Antiochene mint were suspended for the rest of Valerian's rule, Alf6ldi assumed that Antioch was captured by Shapuhr in that year, as well as in 253 and 260. However, with the evidence of the inscription, it is now clear that Syria was invaded only twice by Shapuhr, and the supposed capture of Antioch in 258/9 therefore disappears. At first sight, Dura provides no apparent support for Rostovtzeff's reconstruction of events: life in Dura in 253, and up to 256, seems to have been "comparatively quiet and undisturbed by disastrous events," and there is evidence for continued commercial relations between Persia and Dura at this time. Yet it seems clear that the Barbalissus expedition, in which Dura was taken, is identical with the invasion recorded by the historians, during which Antioch was first cap- tured by the Persians, and this can have taken place only in 253. The solution may be that Dura was occupied only briefly, and without a fierce struggle, perhaps on the withdrawal of the Roman garrison. The early evacuation of the town by the Persians may have been the result of the defeat of Shapuhr's southern army near Hemesa by Sampsiceramus, and of Odenath's activities. Two drawings found at Dura are of interest in this connection. The first, in Iranian style, depicts the victory of a Sassanian king over the Romans. Such a scene could not normally be depicted in Roman Dura, but if it were done during the occupation of 253, its obscure position in a private house might have enabled it to pass unnoticed during the period before the final siege of the city. The other, found in the office of the actuarius of the xxth Palmyrene cohort, represents a Roman officer sacrificing to the Palmyrene god Jarhibol, while a noble Palmyrene, on horseback, receives tokens of honor and greeting. Rostovtzeff had previously ex- plained the scene as a sacrifice to the victorious god of Palmyra in the presence of Odenath on the occasion of his visit to Dura after his great victories over Shapuhr in 260. It is now known that the drawing was buried from the time of the siege of 956; hence Rostovtzeff now refers it to the events of 253. If this is accepted, and it seems almost beyond dispute, it is a welcome confirma- tion of his closely reasoned thesis. The numismatic evidence from Dura for this period is discussed by A. R. BELLINGER in Berytus viii, 1943, pp. 61-71. The latest issues of Trebonianus Gallus, both tetradrachms and Antoniniani, though bearing the officina marks characteristic of the mint of Antioch, differ from the usual types sufficiently to suggest a difference of mint. The capture of Antioch in 253 would be an obvious occasion for this transference of the mint to a safer place. The rare tetradrachms of Sulpicius Antoninus, issued at Emisa in 253/4 are patent imitations of the tetradrachms of Gallus, and the likeliest explanation is that they are the work of the same die-sinkers. Hence we may conclude that in the last year of Gallus the mint was moved from Antioch to Emisa. When the imperial power in Syria collapsed with the fall of Antioch, a pretender, for a brief period, carried on at Emisa the imperial functions, and issued coins closely patterned on those of his predecessor. It is probable, though not certain, that this Sulpicius Antoninus is the Sampsiceramus famous for his defense of Emisa against Shapuhr. The possible capture of Dura in 253 is strongly supported by the fact that six hoards of coins give evidence of having been buried in that year, as against five buried in 255/6 when we know the town was taken. Finally, Bellinger here analyzes the evidence of the coins found in hoards dating from the last siege of Dura, or discovered with the corpses of soldiers killed in the fighting. This study leads to a number of modifications in the conclusions reached by Alfaldi. The suggestion of Olmstead</page><page sequence="7">184 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY that the second Syrian mint of Valerian was at Emisa appears more than ever probable. PALESTINE AND SYRIA Primitive Weaving. -In an article on "Handicrafts in Palestine" (PEQ. July-Oct. 1943), GRACE M. CROWFOOT discusses primitive weaving (plaiting and finger-weaving) in Pales- tine and neighboring countries and makes com- parisons with the same stage in other parts of the world. Four plates of illustrations are given. Sodom and Gomorrah. - J. PENROSE HAR- LAND concludes his study of the "Cities of the Plain" in Bibl. Archaeologist vi, 1943, pp. 41-54 (5 figs.). This article deals with their destruction. After a brief summary of the contents of his first paper, about their location (ibid. v, 1942, pp. 17-32, summarized in AJA, xlvi, 1942, p. 552) he shows that the catastrophe that caused the destruction of these cities could have been no ordinary conflagration, but "so great and so awful that the memory of it remained fixed in men's minds." Harland first considers the Biblical evidence, the first reference being in Gen. xiii, 10. Next come the eighteenth and nineteenth chapters of Genesis, where it is stated that not even ten righteous men could be found in Sodom, while apparently there was no such search made in Gomorrah, Admah or Zeboiim, for none of which cities does Abraham make any plea. The destruction of the cities is described in Gen. xix, 24-28. There is no possibility of volcanic activity in this region, to account for the heavy smoke that accompanied the conflagration. The evidence of later writers is then discussed. Strabo (xvi, 2, 42-44) has much to say about the Dead Sea, notes the presence of asphalt in the region, and speaks of the existence at that time of scorched rock-which seems to be based on the report of an eye-witness. Another later writer, Philo Judaeus, mentions the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, but his account is un- reliable. More important is Josephus (iv, 476- 485), who describes the Dead Sea, its output of asphalt, and is the first, apparently, to mention the Dead Sea fruits. It would appear that he had visited the region, as he speaks of remains of the cities being visible, from which it is evident that in the first century of our era the entire plain was not under water. Tacitus (Hist. v, 7), relying on accounts of travellers, mentions that the region had lost its fertility. Diodorus, Strabo, and Tacitus all speak of foul odors coming from the bitter waters of the Dead Sea, and that when asphalt is about to be forced to the surface the people are warned of it by these odors. This suggests the presence of gas in antiquity-in recent years these gaseous emanations (perhaps derived from sulphur) may have become exhausted. As a result of the statements in Genesis and in later authors, Harland reconstructs the story of the destruction of the cities as the result of earth- quakes, accompanied perhaps by lightning, causing a terrific conflagration from ignition of gases and seepages of asphalt. Earthquakes are frequent in this valley, and seepages of asphalt and bitumen abundantly evidenced by ancient tradition and modern record. The gaseous fumes may have come from deposits of oil or petroleum, and an article on the geology of the Dead Sea by B. K. N. Wyllie (in Geological Mag. 1931, pp. 366-372), a geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, suggests that oil was expected to be found in Palestine. Josephus notes (iv, 478) that the waters of the Dead Sea change in color during the day, which is believed to be due to a thin layer of oil on the surface of the water. This is confirmed by numerous authorities, who agree that oil is to be found in this region. The best case for oil as a contributing cause for the destruction of the cities is given by the late Frederick G. Clapp* (AJA. xl, 1936, pp. 323-344, and Bull. Am. Assn. Petroleum Geologists xx, 1936, pp. 881-909), from whom Harland quotes in detail. A section of the article is devoted to the so- called "Apples of Sodom," an inedible fruit. In Deut. xxii, 32, mention is made of the "vine of Sodom" whose "grapes are grapes of gall." These grapes are, according to Harland, not to be associated with the vine of Sodom, which is identified in the Oxford Concordance as the colocynth, a form of melon, which has a fruit resembling an orange in appearance, but bitter to the taste. In Wisdom x, 7, this fruit has become a tree fruit. Josephus intimates that he saw it with his own eyes, and Tacitus quotes fellow- Romans who described it to him. Fulcher of Chartres, the historian of the First Crusade (1095-1099) also describes this fruit as one who has seen it. Sir John Mandeville, who travelled in the Near East from 1322 to 1356, and wrote a totally unreliable account of what he saw, nevertheless seems to have visited the southern end of the Dead Sea, and describes quite recog- * Died, February 18, 1944.</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 185 nizably the "Apple of Sodom." In 1848, Lieuten- ant W. F. Lynch, USN, describes "a species of melon" brought to him, which was, of course, a colocynth. In 1924 Dr. Kyle had experience of both the "apple" and the "melon"-the apples are called "osher" by the Arabs, and it is be- lieved that the "ashes" with which the apples are sometimes filled are the result of attack by insect pests. A brief note is then given of the subsequent history of the Plain, which has been submerged as a result of earthquakes and the natural rise in level of the Dead Sea. The region has not been reinhabited, owing to these phenomena and for religious reasons, making it, in the words of Albright, "a terrible memorial of human wicked- ness and the wrath of an angry God." Finally, Harland discusses the question of oil in Palestine, which is proved to exist, but it is not yet revealed whether the commercial possibilities are of great significance, although one is left with the im- pression that they are. Hebrew Coin. - A. REIFENBERG in PEQ., July- Oct., 1943, discusses a Hebrew coin of the fifth century s.c., which is said to have been found in the vicinity of Hebron. It is described as AR 16 mm.; 3.88 grm. On the obverse is a male bearded head facing the left; the eye is full. The hair is partly shown by granulated lines and is taken up in a knot at the back. On the reverse appears a female head facing the right; it may be Aphrodite- Astarte. The eye is full, and the hair falls in a club on the back of the neck. She wears an ear- ring, which is the letter 'ayin; the ear-ring forms the last letter of the word beqa' (half shekel). The coin is of about the middle of the fifth century B.C. It seems to be an imitation of the Attic standard of a drachma (maximum 4.36 grm.). The Athenian silver money had become almost an international currency in the fifth century and was accepted by both Greeks and non-Greeks in preference to all other coins. It seems that the Attic coins were imitated in other parts of the world. The heathen character of the coin in no way disproves the assumption that it was struck by a Jewish authority. Reifenberg assumes that the coin came from a Jewish mint, and he suggests that it was struck under the authority of Nehemiah, who reduced the temple tax from half a shekel to one third. The old shekel weighed approximately 12 grams; the light stater of the Attic standard which found its way into Palestine by the fifth century weighed only about 8 grams. Reifenberg concludes ac- cordingly that this coin represents one half of the Attic standard, or approximately one third of the old standard. He thinks that this beqa' explains the change in the temple tax (Neh. 10:3q2). This coin is not only the oldest Hebrew coin, but is also likely to shed some light on the period of Nehemiah. Lachish. - DAvID DIR1NGER, in PEQ., July- Oct. 1943, discusses three ostraca with inscrip- tions. While the inscriptions are too fragmentary for interpretation, they are of importance for studying the forms of certain letters of the alphabet. Two plates with the transliterations are given. The Ten Lost Tribes. -H. G. MAY has a short paper on this subject in Bibl. Archaeologist vi, 1943, pp. 55-60 (2 figs.). After a resume of some recent efforts to solve the problem, in which the results are negative, the writer discusses the theory, many times advanced, that the Anglo- Saxons are the ten lost tribes. The absurdity of this theory is abundantly demonstrated, and it is shown that the "Stone of Scone," which forms the seat of the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey, and which is claimed to be of Judaean origin, is of a form of sandstone never found in Palestine, but common to the west coast of Scot- land. It is further proven that what exile there was (namely, from Samaria) was not in the reign of Shalmanezer V, as the Anglo-Israelites claim, but occurred in the reign of Sargon, in 721 B.c. Even then it was not the entire territory of the ten tribes that he conquered, and his deportations, even when combined with those of his predecessor, Tiglath-Pileser III, were relatively small. In other words, the ten tribes as such were never exiled, and continued for the most part in Pales- tine, so that they were never "lost." Of those few Israelites who were exiled, archaeology provides several hints as to what happened to them. A letter to an Assyrian king mentions two officials in Gozan, who were possibly Hebrews from Samaria. A group of cuneiform texts from Kannu in Mesopotamia, dating in the seventh century B.C., dealing with the transfer of slaves, mentions names almost certainly Hebrew, who were per- haps exiles from Samaria. Finally, Aramaic papyri of the fifth centufly B.c. have been found at Elephantine in Egypt, dealing with a Jewish colony there, who speak of themselves as Judae- ans. In the previous century, refugees from Bethel appear to have joined, and been absorbed by, the Jews already there. As is well known, the</page><page sequence="9">186 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY prophets of the Old Testament frequently pre- dict the return of Israel, as well as Judah, from exile, but "we cannot say whether the prophets actually knew any Israelitish exile." Ras Shamra.-In his publication of the Mitannian battle axe of iron found at Ras Shamra, Schaeffer relied chiefly on a brief report by Brun for his technical data. HARRY CRAIG RICHARDSON, in Berytus viii, 1943, p. 72, points out certain gaps in that report, and calls for a thorough metallographic examination. Despite the low nickel content, it is improbable that the iron was made from pyrrhotite ore, as Brun suggested. To make iron from that re- quires a special operation to eliminate sulphur, and it is easier to assume that the iron is meteoric. AEGEAN Alleged Fortifications, Cnossus. - In a note in JHS. lxii, 1942, pp. 84-85, A. W. LAWRENCE contends that the military aspect of the succession of buildings by the north entrance, which faced the sea and the greatest potential dangers, has been overstated. The "keep," so-called by Sir Arthur Evans, is an isolated block, stretching between the north and central courts, and dated soon after the beginning of the M.M.I. period, with the foundations showing pits 7 m. deep, probably intended for cisterns. The whole area may be interpreted as a subterranean reservoir, from which water could be drawn from mouths in the ground floor, which consisted of small rooms accessible from both the north court and the central court of the palace, while an upper floor comprised larger rooms and conceivably a portico against the north face, open to the sea breeze. The elevation may be visualized from the faience tablets of the "Town Mosaic." The north entrance, Lawrence likewise believes, seems to be meant only to impress, like the monumental gateways of modern buildings that fulfill the same functions of palace or government offices. GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS "Scientific Ionian Philosophy." - To the question "was the Ionian philosophy scientific?" F. M. CORNFORD in JHS. lxii, 1942, pp. 1-7, gives the answer that it is a mistake to assume that the empirical theory of knowledge governed the speculations of ancient Ionia. The problem is con- cerned with the puzzle of why the Ionians not only describe with complete confidence matters beyond the reach of observation, such as the origin of the world, but when they come to matters of detail, they make assertions that could have been upset by a little careful observation or by the simplest experiment. Cornford suggests that the key to the problem lies in a difference of atti- tude toward the question of sources of knowledge, the distinction between the methods of medical science and those of philosophy. The philosopher descends from above to deduce the nature of man from unproved postulates, the physician builds up his theory, generalizing from observed facts. These two approaches are reflected in two oppo- site accounts of the sources of knowledge. The empirical theory of knowledge, set forth by Aristotle, starts with the senses, and in the higher animals sensation gives rise to memory. In man repeated memories of the same thing result in unified experience, from which come generaliza- tion and knowledge. This point of view was formu- lated when the doctors, under the influence of Ionian nationalism, were freeing their art from its magical phase. The alternative theory of the sources of knowledge was formulated by Plato, and in Cornford's opinion, is the older of the two. It accounts for the dogmatism of the philosophers and rests on a very different conception of the nature and contents of memory. The imagery of the Phaedrus myth enables us to connect the theory of philosophic knowledge as drawn from memory with prophetic enthusiasm and the in- spiration of the poet. It comes as a revelation. To understand the attitude of the early philosopher we must see him as emerging from the composite picture of seer, poet, and sage. The philosopher thus appears as the rationalizing successor of the poet-seer, relying at the outset on the traditional wisdom, confirmed by his own inward conviction. Scenes from Euripides on Bactrian Silver. - Three "Bactrian" silver bowls with scenes on their outer surfaces are published by KURT WEITZMANN in The Art Bulletin xxv, 1943, pp. 289-324. Two of the bowls are in the Hermitage in Leningrad; the other is in New York. In shape and type of decoration the bowls resemble the clay "Megarian" bowls. Weitzmann believes that the three silver vessels were derived from one group of Megarian bowls, the so-called "Homeric bowls," which were adorned with scenes from epic poems and dramas. The only dramatist repre- sented on the clay bowls is Euripides, and this also appears to be the case with the silver bowls. The author interprets the figure groups on one</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 187 bowl in the Hermitage as representing scenes from the Alcestis, the Alope, the Bacchae and the Ion. The other bowl in Leningrad may bear scenes from the satyr play, Syleus. The scenes on the New York bowl are again from several differ- ent dramas, probably the Mad Heracles, the Hippolytus Crowned, the Peliades, the Bellerophon, the Hypsipyle and others. The relative proportion of pure Greek and Oriental elements in the treat- ment of the figure types, costumes, attributes, etc., serves as a basis for dating the silver bowls. A terminus post quem is, of course, established by the Megarian bowls in the third century B.C., and it is obvious that some time elapsed before the earliest of the silver bowls was made. The earliest of the three is probably the New York piece and other stylistic evidence would seem to indicate a date approximately at the beginning of the Chris- tian era. In conclusion Weitzmann discusses briefly a fragment of a Megarian bowl found in an excavation in the Punjab near Peshawar. The scenes on it were identified by the excavator, John Marshall, as being from Sophocles' Antigone. Weitzmann believes that they may be rather from Euripides' Auge. Graeco-Roman Shepherds and Art.- CJ. xxxix, pp. 366-368, prints an interesting note by E. L. HIGHBARGER, listing references to works of art in Virgil's Bucolics, the Idylls of Theocritus, and in the Philebus and Phaedrus of Plato, in the former of which dialogues allusion is made to a statue made by shepherds (the italics are the au- thor's). He reaches the conclusion that both in the Greek authors and in Virgil we may see "reflec- tions of actual life" and that they were "closer to daily life than we suspect." Recent Gift to Metropolitan.- C(HRISTINE) A(LEXANDER) contributes a note to BMMA. n.s. ii, 1943, opposite p. 85 (fig.) announcing that the Metropolitan Museum has received as a bequest a small collection of antiquities, including eight sculptures, mostly Roman copies or adaptations of Greek types, one of which is illustrated, and all of which are briefly described. Besides the sculp- tures, the collection includes three small Attic lekythoi, and two Tanagra figurines. The Philinna Papyrus. -P. MAAs in JHS. lxii, 1949, pp. 33-38, discusses the Philinna Papyrus (P. Amh. 11 and P. Berol. 7504), a text of two separate fragments, properly belonging to- gether, and consisting of a collection of hexamet- rical charms, each of which has a title, indicating the name of the author, his or her nationality, the disease for which the charm is intended. No earlier collection of Greek charms is known and no similar collection. The name of the Thessalian Philinna, who gives the title to the payrus, is a typical female name, and does not help with the dating, but the character of the first and third charm does not point to a period earlier than Hellenistic. ARCHITECTURE The Ionian Agora. - The agora, the nucleus of all Greek cities, was in the beginning simply a convenient open space, around which buildings were irregularly placed. With the growth of systematic planning in Ionia-a new type was evolved, and the old-fashioned agora and the Ionian agora existed side by side. F. J. Tritsch (JOAI. xxvii, 1932, pp. 64-105) has already given an account of the old type of agora, taking Elis as the best example. R. E. WYCHERLEY now under- takes in JHS. lxii, 1942, pp. 21-32, a brief general account of the new or Ionian agora, which he believes has not been given the place that it deserves in the history of Hellenic architecture. Since remarkable Hellenistic developments have been revealed in the agora at Athens, the question may well be asked whether the influence of new ideas and methods produced modifications of the older type there. The difference between the two kinds of agora depends on the treatment of the stoas, as Pausanias suggests. In the old- fashioned agora the buildings in general and the stoas in particular were irregularly placed and did not form an architectural whole, whereas, as Pausanias implies, the cities of Ionia and the Greek cities near Ionia were laid out and built according to a single scheme. In these the agora was distinguished by groups of stoas built con- tiguous to one another and the so-called horseshoe -three stoas at right angles-was favored, but there were variations and other possibilities. Be- fore good examples were revealed by excavation it was often assumed that the ideal consisted of four stoas completely enclosing a rectangular space. This idea is now disproved. The horseshoe type, i.e. three stoas forming three sides of a rectangle, the fourth being occupied by an impor- tant street with public buildings or another stoa beyond it, was introduced on a vast scale at Miletus in the south agora complex in the course of the third century. Wycherley considers this agora, belonging to a great commercial city, along with that at Priene, an Ionian agora in a small</page><page sequence="11">188 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY town, and that of Magnesia on the Maeander, which falls somewhere between the two. Finally he examines in some detail and in contrast the agoras of Pergamum, Hellenistic Delos, and Hel- lenistic Athens. Stoas and City Walls on the Pnyx. - H. A. THOMPSON and R. L. SCRANTON publish in Hes- peria xii, 1943, pp. 269-383, a full report of their excavations on the Pnyx, undertaken in 1936 and 1937. The first half of the report, dealing with the buildings, is handled by Thompson. An important new building was discovered, the West Stoa, southwest of the Assembly Place, 149.32 m. long x 19.30 m. wide. Nothing is left of the superstruc- ture. Best preserved is the foundation of the stylobate, marked by a bedding prepared in front of it for the steps, and containing a series of rec- tangular pits, either cut into the rock or formed by omission of appropriate blocks from the foun- dation. Thompson believes that these were for basins in a gutter in front of the colonnade, and from their spacing concludes that 54 columns in antis were intended on the facade of the building. The stoa may well have had interior supports and may have reached two stories high. Possibly the stoa was never completed. Another building, partially studied in earlier campaigns, and then called the Long Stoa, is now called the East Stoa, because of its discovered relation to the West Stoa. Little new was uncovered for its early stages of construction, but it is supposed that it had 22 columns in antis, was one storey high with a series of rooms along the back. At the west end of the East Stoa a rectangular foundation, previously examined in part, is now thought possibly to have been a propylon, though the evidence is slight. The most important feature of the examination of these buildings is the new evidence for chronology. Whereas in earlier reports it was thought that the East Stoa dated from the first century A.D., it is now fairly definitely established that both stoas and related buildings were begun around the third quarter of the fourth century B.c. As the stoa group would appear to have an integral relation to the Assembly Place, it is suggested that the third period of the Assembly Place may be dated in this period, not that of Hadrian, as formerly supposed. It is possible that the whole complex of the Stoas and the rebuilding of the Assembly Place may have begun under Lykourgos about 330-326 B.c. The former attribution of the East Stoa to the Thesmophorion is now abandoned. The second part of the report, handled by R. L. Scranton, is concerned with the city walls. The city wall from the monument of Philopappos to the Hill of the Nymphs was examined, and two major periods of construction and several repairs identified. The line of the fortification was orig- inally a cross wall above the outer defenses and Long Walls in this area. The original fortification here was the Compartment Wall, now dated 307- 295 B.c. The most significant features include a gate complex in the valley between the central Pnyx Hill and the Museum Hill, arranged as a dipylon with two heavy towers flanking an en- trance to a rectangular, court, closed at the rear by a gate between spur walls. On the slopes of the Museum Hill an interesting round tower was uncovered. The fortress, occupying the summit and northern slopes of the hill, presumably built by Demetrios Poliorcetes, was found to be part of the Compartment Wall. The second major con- struction is represented by a wall built of white poros blocks, across the crest of the central Pnyx Hill. For the most part it lies outside the line of the Compartment Wall. Well preserved in its foundation is a great semicircular tower of the westernmost projection. The wall is noteworthy for the systematic use of buttresses about 1.40 m. square, reinforcing the wall at intervals of ca. 4.60 m., the wall itself being only 2.00 m. thick. A postern gate was identified in the wall opposite the southwestern corner attributed to the pro- pylon. An outer gate between the towers of the Compartment Wall dipylon was constructed at this time. On the ruins of this were found the iron pivot for the door, numerous studs and nails and other evidence for the construction of the gate door. Construction at the junction of the Pnyx wall system with the outer city fortifications at the top of the Museum Hill suggests that the outer line to the west was abandoned when the White Poros Wall was built, probably in the last quarter of the third century. Various repairs were identified, of which the most important are that of the late second or third century B.C., tentatively ascribed to Valerian in 253 A.D., and an elaborate reconstruction from the time of Justinian, when the whole system of towers was rebuilt. Some work in repair of the fortifications was also done in the latter part of the twelfth century. A number of graves, ranging in date from the fourth century to mediaeval times, are described, and a small sanctuary on the Hill of the Nymphs.</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 189 SCULPTURE Athletic Honors.- In CJ. xxxix, pp. 9278-989, GEORGE E. MYLONAS reconsiders the problem of the size of victor statues, and the honors awarded to victorious athletes, in the fifth century. This is due in large degree to the recovery of the bronze statue from the sea off the coast of Artemisium in 1996. This statue has usually been considered that of a god, but JUthner (in AM. lxii, 1937, pp. 136- 148) seeks to prove that it is of a victor in the pentathlon, citing the copy of the Doryphoros of Polykleitos in Munich, which is over life-size, as a parallel; but this analogy is of no merit, as other copies of this statue exist, which are of life-size or less. Hyde, in his Olympic Victor Monuments, considers that occasionally victor statues of over life-size were produced, but his evidence is not convincing, based as it is on statues now lost, and quotations attributed to Aristotle in scholia of Pindar. Mylonas shows, from a study of the manuscript tradition of Pindar that Hyde was following C. MUller (Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum) in attempting to combine scholia of two families into one, which he proves is incorrect, and that a statement is arbitrarily attributed to Aristotle which he did not make. Thus literary and archaeological evidence does not indicate the existence of victor statues of over life-size, and it is highly significant that the only fifth-century vic- tor statue which has come down to us in the original, the Charioteer of Delphi, is only 1.80 m. high, or about life-size. The honors bestowed on victorious athletes are fully discussed by Gardiner (Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals) and are listed by Mylonas, but there is no evidence that in the fifth century any divine honors were bestowed. Five great athletes of the fifth century are known to have been given divine honors, but an examina- tion of the stories about them as given by Pau- sanias, shows that they were worshipped not be- cause of their victories, but as retribution for wrongs sustained, or because of divine favor shown them, that had nothing to do with their athletic prowess. The most bitter opponent of athleticism in the fifth century, the philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon, has nothing whatever to say of divine honors accorded them-and this is significant, while honors are tacitly denied by Euripides, in a fragment from his lost Autolykos, in which he speaks of athletes in their old age as "worn-out garments." Nor would a deified athlete be ostracized by the Athenians, as the renowned athlete, Kallias of Athens, was. To sum up: lit- erary and archaeological evidence alike denies athletes divine honors; their statues were of life- size, and only five out of a total of eight hundred received such worship, and that for quite different reasons. The Harpy Tomb, Xanthus. -F. J. TRITSCH undertakes to interpret in JHS. lxii, 1942, pp. 39-50, the meaning of the Lycian sculptures from Xanthus now in the British Museum. The Harpy Tomb consisted of a square shaft in one block, 17 ft. high, placed on a base rising on one side 6 ft. from the ground, and on the other side but a little above the present level of the ground. Around the sides of the top of the shaft were ranged the bas- reliefs in white marble about 3 ft., 3 in. high. The east side of the tomb, with whose reliefs the pres- ent article is concerned, shows the stately figure of a bearded man enthroned and surrounded by four younger male figures. The relief seems to con- sist of two very different groups of figures. To the left, the three figures, one enthroned and two standing, are all in very rigid and formal attitudes, well wrapped up in long garments, and looking to the right. Even their gestures resemble one an- other and the movement of their right arms form- ing a circle with head and shoulder, has a cre- scendo effect, that is, grows larger towards the center. In contrast, the right-hand group is much freer in its movements and contours. There are only two figures, both worshippers of the central figure. Their arms are outstretched and pointing towards the center. One of these, a slender young boy, throwing back his head and lifting his eyes, stretches out his arms and brings a cock and fruit as offerings to the bearded old man before him, who, seated on his throne, seems to take no notice at all. The usual interpretation of the figures has been that of a god, frequently Poseidon, with attendants behind and worshippers in front. Tritsch argues that the clear connection of the left half of the relief with the Persian formal audience reliefs of the fifth century would indicate that the enthroned man on the Harpy Tomb, whether or not he wears the so-called Phrygian cap to show his position, is the ruler of Xanthus. He and his court ceremonial are represented on his tomb, on its east side, facing the agora for all his people to see. On the right-hand side of the relief the small figure is not a young boy, but a Persian noble, much reduced in size to show the king in turn as something more than mortal. The figure at the extreme right, a man with his dog,</page><page sequence="13">190 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY like the so-called boy presenting an offering, is a favorite subject for tombstones in Greece. In this whole relief then the artist has presented on the left the traditional and very strictly observed features of the Lycian court ceremonial, which did not permit much freedom of movement, whereas the right-hand side shows the artist choosing with much more liberty the figures for some of the ruler's worshippers or courtiers, which are much more Greek in character. The left half of the relief reflects the more formal Oriental in- fluence in art. In this instance we may see the east side of the Harpy Tomb as an excellent example of the way in which the Greekizing influence worked in the Near East. The Laocoiin Group.- Under the title, "Ig- norance, The End," WILLIAM M. IVINS, JR., in a very interesting article in BMMA. (n.s. ii, 1943, pp. 2-10; 13 figs.) shows how differently the same object may appear to different artists, all "com- petent draughtsmen, each representing an object truthfully as he is acquainted with it." The piece under consideration is the Laocoin group. Illus- trated are ten engravings, woodcuts, or etchings, dating from about 1500 up to 1890, and all show- ing very clear differences. Three photographs, one of the complete group, and two of the head of Laocodn, also show that even the camera can show different phases of the same thing. VASES The Kernos.-In Harv.St. liii, 1942, pp. 180-181, is printed an abstract of a doctoral dis- sertation by FRIEDA SCHAUROTH UPSON on The Kernos in Ancient Cult. The term kernos is derived from literary sources, and these sources are not in absolute agreement with each other. Nevertheless, archaeologists have identified as kernoi objects answering to literary descriptions, and a large proportion of these vessels have been found at Eleusis. Their use in the Eleusinian Mysteries is, however, not attested by literature. That the kernos was a cult instrument is shown by their discovery in Bronze Age sites of all periods. The earliest appear to be Cypriote, and to date in E.C. III; the latest are of the fourth century B.c. from Eleusis. Their distribution is widespread, not merely in Greek lands, but they have also been found in Egypt, Palestine, Asia Minor, Sicily and Carthage. Al! prove to be associated with the cult of a vegetation goddess, and it is possible to present evidence for their use in the Eleusinian Mysteries. Corinthian Vases in Hearst Collection. - In Univ. of Calif. Publications in Class. Arch. i, pp. 207-940, pls. 98-32, D. A. AMYX makes a very detailed and careful study of five Corinthian vases in the collection of Mr. William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon, Calif. The first is a pyxis with three handles in the form of female busts, intact and with lid, said to have been found at Corinth. It was formerly in the Torr collection, which was dispersed in 1929, and is mentioned in Payne's Necrocorinthia, where it is assigned to the end of the Middle Corinthian period (580-575 B.C.), as an example of what Payne calls the Delicate Style. Comparisons of this vase with other examples in various museums are made in great detail, and an attempt is made to arrange the known pyxides of this form in chronological order. For the later Corinthian style, recourse is had to Jenkins in BSA. 39, p. 34 f. In this connection four vases in the Metropolitan Museum are published, which belong in the later style. The second vase is a flat-bottomed aryballos, which is placed in the earlier part of the Middle Corinthian period, by comparison with similar vases in various mu- seums, listed for the most part by Payne. The writer stresses the connection between these flat- bottomed aryballoi and the plates of the "Chi- maera Group" identified by Payne, and the two classes show such a contrast with the vases of the "Delicate Style" that Amyx calls them the "Heavy Style." An aryballos in Detroit is pub- lished for purposes of comparison. The third vase is a squat oenochoe, intact, and with its stopper preserved. It probably belongs in the end of the Middle Corinthian period, and shows marked differences in style with other vases of this shape. The fourth, a pyxis with lid, is by the same hand as pyxides in Boston (Fairbanks, Cat. no. 482, pl. 47) and Amsterdam, while related to this group are others in Bucharest, Berkeley, and the British Museum. This pyxis stands close to the work of the Dodwell Painter, and may be by an artist called by Amyx the Ampersand Painter-cer- tainly the connection is very close. The last vase is a "bottle" of a form almost unique, belonging in the late Corinthian period, and is therefore later than most of the vases of this form which have been previously published. The final pages of the article (pp. SS7-end) are devoted to foot- notes to the text, very exhaustive and complete. In the beginning of the essay, Amyx states that he has "tried to make each piece yield some new knowledge of its setting" and "to interpret inde-</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 191 pendently and sympathetically the vases en- trusted to me for publication"-and he may be said to have successfully accomplished his pur- pose. Two Black-Figured Amphorae. -In GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 183-189 (6 figs.), DOROTHY KENT HILL publishes two Attic black-figured panel-amphorae in the Walters Collection in Baltimore, formerly in the Massarenti Collection in Rome, from which they were purchased by Mr. Walters in 1902. The first of these vases, which has on the obverse Herakles bringing Kerberos from Hades, with Hermes and two women in attendance, and on the reverse a scene tentatively interpreted as Herakles and Iolaos bringing Alkes- tis back to earth, is attributed to Exekias as an early work. The second had been at one time much restored; it is of a later type, with flanged handles. It shows a Pyrrhic dance scene on the obverse, and a battle on the reverse. It is considered to be in the manner of the Antimenes Painter, but not necessarily by his hand, and is dated about 530 B.c., ten years at least later than the first one. INSCRIPTIONS Greek Epigraphy, 1939-1940.-M. N. TOD makes a survey of the work done in the field of Greek epigraphy in 1939-1940 in JHS. lxii, 1942, pp. 51-83, according to the plan of his earlier work, i.e. by sections of the Greek world, Attica, the Peloponnese, central and northern Greece, Macedonia, Thrace and Scythia, the islands of the Aegean, western Europe, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Africa. Prior to his detailed analysis of progress in each of the areas mentioned, Tod summarizes the most important general publica- tions in the field. Of the Inscriptiones Graecae one new instalment, containing the supplements to vol. xii, edited by F. Hiller von Gaertringen, has appeared; of J. J. E. Hondius' Supplementum Epigraphicum Graceum, the first part of vol. ix has been published and of A. S. Arvanitopoulos' work, 'E-trypatplKi1 (Athens, 1937-1939) two in- stalments have been issued. Inscriptions in Fitzwilliam Museum. -F. M. HEICHELHEIM publishes in JHS. lxii, 1942, pp. 14-20, a complete list, and, where it seems ad- visable, a full description of sixty-four inscriptions in stone, bronze, and wood, now in the collection of Greek inscriptions in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Twenty-four of these are unpub- lished. The collection includes material from Athens, Peloponnesus, the islands, Crete, Pontus, Phanagoria, Troas, Ionia, Caria, Phrygia, Egypt, Nubia, Rome, Britain, and three of uncertain provenance. Corinthiaca. - Under this title, STERLING Dow, in Harv. St. liii, 1942, pp. 89-119 (pl.) reexamines a number of the previously published inscriptions from Corinth. (This is the second article by Dow under this title, the first having appeared in this JOURNAL xlvi, 1942, pp. 69-72). Calling attention to the lack of material extant, either in literature or in epigraphy, regarding the history of Corinth in the Greek period, he nevertheless points out that "more can be learned than has been learned from the inscriptions already published." First, he takes up a list of names under rubrics (Cor. viii, 1, 11) for which he gives a revised text, with a description of the stone, notes on the text, and a very full commentary, proving that the rubrics stand for the four main tribes of Corinthians, which were later divided each into two divisions, making eight tribes in all. He believes this in- scription to be a list of men fallen in battle, and dates it in the fourth century, probably in the latter half. Taking up next "Various Inscriptions of the Greek Period" he discusses, and in some cases gives new readings or interpretations, of Cor. viii, 1, nos. 22, 221, 235, 36, 225, and 21. The Decrees are next studied, and he employs the same process with Cor. viii, 1, nos. 2-9; he follows Woodward in rejecting no. 7 as a decree, and he also excludes no. 9 which, in any case, is Roman in date, while nos. 4 and 6 are probably not de- crees of Corinth at all, but of other places, honor- ing Corinthians. The principal thing that we can learn from these decrees is that Corinth had an ekklesia, which was at its strongest after 243 B.C. Dow concludes his article by discussing the paucity of inscriptional material of the era before 146 B.C., and decides that the reason lay in the temper of the people, who were not interested in public documents; he also suspects that the per- centage of illiteracy may have been high. Fur- thermore, Corinth appears to have been governed during most of the Greek period by a mercantile oligarchy, rather than a democracy. Olympichus of Alinda.-E. W. WALBANK in JHS. lxii, 1942, pp. 8-13, discusses the evidence for the participation of Olympichus of Alinda as a general in the Carian expedition of Antigonus Doson, and concludes that in 202 Olympichus was still an independent dynast, known to be closely connected with Philip v, but not openly and directly under his authority. The change in status</page><page sequence="15">192 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY must have come, not with Doson's Carian expedi- tion, but with Philip's, dated in 201 B.c. on the basis of an inscription (BCH. Iviii, 1934, pp. 291- 298), found at Demirdjiderb in 1934 and published by A. Laumonier. The obscure expedition of Doson in 227 may have resulted in the opening up of relations of a loose kind in the form of guest- friendship with the then ruler of Alinda. In the course of time Philip evidently revived his rela- tions with Alinda and obtained the collaboration of Olympichus in a mutually profitable scheme of expansion. Following upon Philip's personal inter- vention in Caria in 201, Olympichus passed di- rectly within his sphere of control, and took the status of oTpaT11yr6s. ITALY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Sardinia. -In Geographical Rev. xxxiii, 1943, pp. 630-654 (18 figs.), DoRo LEVI writes a com- prehensive study of the geography, history, and archaeology of this too-little known island, from earliest times to the present day. Geographically, Sardinia lies on a meridional line from the Gulf of Genoa to Africa, a remnant of an ancient sub- merged land mass. Its mountains are rich in lead, zinc, and copper. The country has but little steady water supply, and marshes and lagoons have brought much malaria to the lowlands, causing a strong difference in temperament between the in- habitants of the interior and those of the coast. The earliest evidence of human life on the island cannot be brought earlier than the Late Neolithic age, and it is probable that the first settlers came from the nearest coast of Africa. They lived in natural caves near the sea - numerous remains have been found near the Gulf of Cagliari. With the usual stone objects are, however, often asso- ciated copper needles, showing a contact with the Eneolithic phase. Their tombs are artificial caves cut in the rock, and consist of one or more rooms with access from a corridor-the best known is the necropolis of Anghelu Ruju. Levi himself in 1936 discovered a new group of tombs on this site, yielding copper weapons and implements, indicat- ing the beginning of the Bronze Age, and relation- ships with the West, particularly Spain, and other objects showing a strong resemblance to the finds from Cycladic sites, suggesting a very definite influence from that region. UtTndeniable relations with Malta are also revealed. The most brilliant period of Sardinian prehis- tory came in the Bronze Age, and is known as "nuragic," from the local name of the most characteristic buildings, the nuraghi. These are conical towers with a narrow entrance, from which a corridor leads to a large central space with a high beehive vault. Often the arrangement is much more complicated, and consists of two or three towers with more than one storey each, con- nected by corridors. They served as fortified castles, and as places of refuge for local tribes. This period is also marked by a great development of the metal industries - furnaces and molds for casting have been discovered, as well as rich finds of weapons and implements, including sword blades of a length of almost 2 m., the longest known from the ancient world. Evidence of rela- tions with the outside world exist in the form of specimens engraved with letters of the Cretan alphabet. Small bronze statuettes have been found, showing the chiefs of tribes, warriors, etc., as well as images of gods. Levi holds that the nuraghi are derived from primitive house con- struction, and believes that this is confirmed by the architecture of the Bronze Age tombs, citing the so-called "Tombs of the Giants," which are derived from dolmens. Menhirs are also found in Sardinia. The most characteristic and imposing sanctuaries are the "well temples"-but smaller examples called "sacred fountains" exist in large numbers, water, perhaps owing to its scarcity, being an object of worship. The nuraghi "bear witness to an extreme territorial division-point- ing to an organization similar to that of the feudal castles of the Middle Ages." Early in its history, Phoenician settlements ap- pear in Sardinia, believed by some authorities to be as early as the tenth century B.c. The most important were on the Gulf of Cagliari, at Caralis (the modern Cagliari) and Nora, on its western promontory. The latter may have even been founded before Carthage. Further investigation of this period is necessary to establish a chronology. We do know, however, that Carthage established her supremacy in the seventh century B.c., and founded a number of new towns and naval bases, driving out Greek influence in 537 B.c. Attempts to conquer the interior were partially successful, but the allegiance of islanders was finally secured through peaceful penetration. During this period the island was extremely prosperous. The long Roman occupation of Sardinia took place with the conquest of the island about 241 n.c., but it was not without frequent rebellion of the inhabitants down to the beginning of the</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 193 Empire. As early as the time of Cicero, Sardinia was considered one of the main granaries of Rome. The Punic language was preserved as late as the Antonine period, and the Carthaginian system of land tenure was maintained. Under the Empire, a large building and public works program was initiated, and roads were built, some of which are still in use. So thorough was the Roman impress on the people that the Sardinians to this day speak a language closer to Latin than any other Italian dialect. With the fall of the Empire, Sardinia was con- quered by the Vandals under Genseric, and this occupation was of long duration. Christianity was adopted, with a tendency towards rigid ortho- doxy. Under Justinian, the island was conquered by Byzantium, but during this period, the real power lay in the hands of the Pope. The danger of an Arab conquest in the Middle Ages was averted by the Republics of Pisa and Genoa, who struggled with each other for the domination of the island. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Pisa held sway over the south and east, Genoa over the northwest. To Pisa in the main is due the fine Romanesque architecture found in Sardinia, which, next to the nuraghi, is the island's characteristic construction. Jealous of the two republics, Pope Boniface VIII, in 1297, invested King James II of Aragon as King of Sardinia, in exchange for his renunciation of Sicily. Thus begins the long period of Spanish conquest and occupation; the island was not completely subdued till 1478, and the oc- cupation, which was the nadir of the island's history, lasted till 1718, when the Treaty of Lon- don ceded it to the House of Savoy, under King Victor Amadeus II, who assumed the style of King of Sardinia. Cagliari became the capital of the Piedmontese kingdom during the Napoleonic era, and until the Peace of Vienna. The article concludes with sections of the part played by the island in the Italian Risorgimento, and its condi- tion in modern times. Temple Above Pompey's Theater. - In CJ. xxxix, pp. 360-365, DOROTHY KENT HILL has a paper on this subject. Pompey built the first permanent stone theater in Rome in 55 B.c., crowning it with a temple: the steps leading to the temple were the seats of the theater. Similar ex- amples already existed in other places-the ear- liest, of the third century B.C., was at Cagliari, and was a sanctuary, with steps in a semicircle for the observance of religious ceremonies. There was another such group at Gabii, of which the remains of the temple still exist; the date of its construc- tion was about 200 B.c., but the stage and its at- tendant building were later. At Praeneste Sulla, in rebuilding the city, laid out a mass of buildings for the cult of Fortuna-the highest point consisted of a semicircular flight of steps, with a colonnade and a small round temple at the top. Most of this is now embodied in the Barberini Palace, but a semicircular flight of twelve steps is still pre- served, which is clearly of Sullan construction. The plan of the group at Praeneste is very similar to that used by Pompey -the plan of his theater is known to us from excavations carried on as early as the fifteenth century, and resumed in the nine- teenth, and from the marble plan of the city in the Antiquarium in Rome. Pompey's temple founda- tion is, however, rectangular, with a round apse in the back, and in its final stage there was an elaborate stage and stage building. Plutarch states that Pompey adopted the plan of the theater at Mitylene, but that may have also resembled Praeneste. The selection of the flat land of the Campus Martius for this construction was un- fortunate, as it gave an impression of ugliness to the ensemble, and for this reason it was never copied. There is some doubt as to whom the tem- ple was dedicated; Tertullian says Venus, Aulus Gellius, Victoria. The worship of Venus Victrix was instituted, according to Servius (Aen. I, 720), by Julius Caesar after Pompey's death. There was opposition in Rome to a permanent theater, and in fact the Senate forbade such con- struction during the second century B.c. Various accounts are given in ancient authors of the ceremonies attending the dedication of the temple and theater. The edifice should be considered as a temple, the steps of which were the seats of a theater; but from that time on, other theaters erected in Rome were of a permanent nature. Mediterranean Antiquities. - The London Times for January 13, 1944, prints an article by JAMES G. MANN, Keeper of the Wallace Collec- tion, regarding the condition of affairs in North Africa, Sicily, and that part of Italy occupied by the United Nations. Most of the sites on the coast of Libya were "scorched but not altogether con- sumed," while Leptis Magna and other sites and museums in Tripolitania were saved, owing to the presence of "a British officer who was also an eminent archaeologist." In Tunis it is understood that the great mosque at Kairouan is intact, and that the French have taken measures to preserve the local sites of importance. In Sicily, the only</page><page sequence="17">194 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY serious losses occurred at Randazzo, where, unfor- tunately, the Italians had deposited works of art for safety, and which was completely destroyed in the fighting, while the cathedrals at Palermo and Catania were damaged. In Italy, the twelfth- century cathedral at Benevento was destroyed; Capua, with its Roman bridge, also suffered, while the Monastery at Monte Cassino had been se- lected as a safe deposit for the bronzes from Her- culaneum, and for many of the pictures of the Naples Museum. In Naples itself, the church of Santa Chiara was destroyed by a fire that lasted for two days; one tower of the Castel Nuovo is lost, but the rest of the building is intact; while the State Archives of Naples, and the contents of the Filangeri Museum were wantonly destroyed by the German army, before evacuating the city. Italian Treasures Destroyed. - The London Times for February 2, 1944, prints a communica- tion from SIR J. GRIGG, Secretary of State for War, in reply to a request from Mr. Keeling, M.P. for Twickenham, regarding work done by the Allied forces to preserve and protect works of art and objects of archaeological importance in North Africa, Sicily, and Southern Italy, and the ma- chinery set up to give the officers entrusted with this work the necessary authority with the mili- tary commanders. He also signalized in most con- demnatory terms the vandalism of the enemy in the destruction of the Library of the University of Naples, and the contents of the Villa Monte- zone near Nola, where besides the South Italian archives, many works of art were wantonly and barbarously destroyed by a people who call them- selves "cultured." An editorial in the same issue of the Times comments on this communication, contrasting the stupid barbarism of the Nazis with the enlightened intelligence shown by the Allied authorities, under the "admirable instruc- tions" of General Eisenhower. EARLY CHRISTIAN Armenian Sculpture. -In The Art Bulletin xxv, 1943, pp. 346-357, ARMENAG SAKISIAN dis- cusses the sculpture on the Church of Sourp Khatch on the Island of Akhthamer, which was built in the first quarter of the tenth century. A large frieze which runs around the outer wall of the church a few meters above the ground bears representations of Biblical themes, alternating with real and fantastic animal figures. Above this are a series of animal heads in relief, a frieze of vines, and, under the eaves, processions of ani- mals. Figures of Christ, the donor King Kakig, and the evangelists also appear on the outside of the building. "The sculpture of Akhthamer is remarkable for its relief and its realism as well as for its monumental character. . . . The church is definitely Armenian in character . . . part of a local nationalist movement which had its roots deep in the soil." MEDIAEVAL All Hallows, Barking.-In AJ. xxiii, 1943, pp. 14-18, T. D. KENDRICK and C. A. RALEIGH RADFORD describe the fragments of an imposing Saxon cross brought to light by an enemy bomb. The date is 1030-1050. Considerably earlier are the remains of an early Saxon wall and arch, also uncovered by the same bomb. These are the most important remains of Saxon building yet found in London. Damage to South Italian Churches. - The Tablet (London) of February 19, 1944, p. 89, has an article which deals for the most part with this subject, though not excluding other monuments. No important monument in Calabria is reported to have been damaged, although much destruc- tion took place at Reggio di Calabria, where the local Archbishop lost his life; but there and in Cosenza the principal losses had already taken place, in the earthquake of 1908. In Lucania, the most serious loss is that of the provincial museum at Potenza, which contained the finds from the Greek temple of Metaponto. In Apulia, some dam- age was done at Taranto, and at Bari the chapter house of the Cathedral was hit, while minor dam- age was done to the famous Church of S. Niccol0, and to several other churches. The towns of Barletta, Trani, Altamura and Canosa, and the famous Castel del Monte, are all intact. The great- est loss yet recorded is the Cathedral at Bene- vento, completely destroyed (the Roman tri- umphal arch there was apparently uninjured), but the Cathedrals at Avellino and Salerno are intact -in the latter are interred the bones of St. Matthew, and the fabric dates from the time of Robert Guiscard. Six churches in Naples are listed as destroyed, of which the most important is that of Sta. Chiara, in which the Angevin Kings were buried. Nineteen others are described as seriously damaged, including the Incoronata, S. Domenico Maggiore, S. Giovanni a Carbonara, S. Gesi Nuovo, and S. Paolo Maggiore. Of secular build- ings and their contents, the most serious loss is that of the South Italian archives, "wantonly de-</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 195 stroyed by men who had full knowledge of what they were doing," which had been deposited near Nola, and were burned (under explicit orders) by the Germans. The Castel Sant'Elmo at Naples was badly hurt by German demolition work. At Capua the whole town suffered, and the Cathedral was destroyed, as well as the eleventh-century church of S. Angelo in Formis near that city. Finally a list of the houses damaged at Pompeii is given -Herculaneum, however, received no hurt at all.-In ibid. for February 26, 1944, there is a supplementary list of churches in Sicily that were injured. The most serious loss was the severe dam- age done to the Cathedral at Messina, already much hurt by the earthquake of 1908. Other churches destroyed are those of the Annunciation at Palermo, and S. Gaetano at Calabria, while listed as badly damaged are S. Francesco and Sta. Maria della Catena at Palermo and S. Niccol6 at Catania. Most of the churches in Palermo needed repairs; "much of this work was undertaken at once." Cartmel Priory. -In AJ. xxiii, 1943, pp. N6-30, J. B. WARD PERKINS describes the armor and equipment on the Harrington effigy (A.D. 1310-1325). The sword is a derivative Viking type, similar to others found in Northern England and Scotland. It is important for the evidence it affords of the late survival of Viking types. Abbey of Pontigny. - We have received a clipping from The Tablet (London) of January 29, 1944, stating that this fine ancient Cistercian Abbey, founded by St. Stephen Harding, was devastated several weeks ago, when members of the resistance movement blew up some adjacent military objective. From this abbey came three Archbishops of Canterbury - St. Thomas, Stephen Langton, and St. Edmund Rich, the latter of whom is buried there. Florentine Romanesque. - Using the Church of San Miniato al Monte as the principal source of information, WALTER HORN discusses the Ro- manesque basilicas in Florence, The Art Bulletin xxv, 1943, pp. 112-131. Three periods of construc- tion, marked by quite obvious changes in masonry technique and material, are apparent in San Miniato. "The church was built in three succes- sive stages: I) The east wall of the crypt; II) the lower story of the facade, the aisle walls, the choir in its entire height to the line of junction which separates the clerestories of nave and choir; III) the clerestory of the nave, the inner arcade of the nave, and the second story of the facade." The problem of dating San Miniato has always been confused by the obvious differences in style of the marble decoration on the upper and lower sections of the facade. Horn shows, however, that the decorative facing was applied during the course of construction and consequently that the lower section of the facade belongs to the second period, while the upper decoration is of the third period. It is probable that the new church was built around an old one, which was kept in use until the new structure was ready for service. The arcades and clerestory of the new nave could not be finished until the old church was removed. This new building was started about 1070 and was finished probably in the second quarter of the twelfth century, with the exception of the pedi- ment which certainly dates from the beginning of the thirteenth century. The author compares the masonry technique and certain decorative details found in other Florentine Romanesque basilicas, some of which can be accurately dated, and thus establishes a relative chronology. In conclusion he points out the strikingly individual character of Florentine Romanesque. RENAISSANCE Giotto.-In The Art Bulletin xxv, 1943, pp. 97-111, FRANK JEWETT MATHER, Jr., discusses the historical evidence for Giotto's authorship of the St. Francis Series at Assisi. Critics who have based their arguments against such an attribu- tion solely on style have either ignored historical facts or interpreted them to fit an agreeable con- clusion. As Dr. Mather says, "in facing a problem in the history of art the first duty is to consider and organize all the documentary and historical evidence. . ... Intuitions based on style are merely accessory to historical research and have no weight against historical evidence to the con- trary." On the basis of facts presented by the au- thor, there can be no doubt that the St. Francis Series was the work of Giotto. Apparent stylistic discrepancies must be, and are subject to reason- able explanation. Leonardo da Vinci and Scientific Drawing. - In Am. Scientist xxxi, 1943, pp. 311-328 (8 figs.), O. BENESCH discusses the drawings of Leonardo, in which, as opposed to his plastic work, of which nothing has remained, and his paintings, of which too few were completed, "we get a totality of un- surpassed richness." Most of these drawings con- sist of illustrations in his scientific manuscripts. "The picture of the artist Leonardo will ever re-</page><page sequence="19">196 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY main incomplete without the scientist." It was the workshops of the artists in the Renaissance that furthered the study of science and mathematics, and the painters became the pioneers of research in anatomy. In Leonardo the scientific spirit of the Quattrocento reaches its culmination, as he was an indefatigable observer, and graphically recorded his observations. More than 7000 pages of his manuscripts, illustrated with his own drawings, have survived. None of these were published dur- ing his lifetime, and many of his manuscripts seem devoid of any system- the writer cites as an ex- ample one in Windsor Castle, in which all manner of subjects are discussed and illustrated without apparent order. It is in the drawings that we must seek a solution of his mental processes. The bulk of the manuscripts are now in (1) the Ambrosian Library in Milan, (2) the Biblioth6que de l'In- stitut in Paris, or (3) Windsor Castle. Benesch concerns himself principally with the Windsor manuscripts, which deal with the biological and descriptive sciences. Leonardo depended almost entirely on his eyes to prove any statements he made, hence his drawings attained "a likeness to reality never before achieved." This is shown in his drawings of plants, flowers and trees, some of which are illustrated. In this connection, Leonardo made the important discovery that the age of trees can be computed from the number of the main shoots of the branches arranged in consecu- tive layers. He was also interested in the accurate representation of the movements of animals, and planned to write a treatise on the subject - some studies of horses in Windsor Castle were intended to illustrate it. A treatise on anatomy was also planned but never completed. His anatomical drawings are among his most beautiful, and were based on actual dissection, as an illustration shows. Although not absolutely free from error, they are a departure from previous work, and the anatomist McMurrich (Leonardo the Anatomist, p. 38) correctly states that if these drawings had been published in his lifetime, they would have caused a revolution in the scientific world. The movements of the body Leonardo considered allied to mechanics, on the elements of which he also planned to write. All this scientific research, how- ever, was undertaken primarily with the idea of its usefulness for the artist. Leonardo was the first artist to sketch and draw in the open air, and therefore his landscapes are based directly on na- ture, and are not studio-pieces, based on memory or tradition. This arouses his interest in the earth as a living organism, hence in geology, one draw- ing of stratified rocks being illustrated. This idea is also shown in his maps, in which his adherence to the principle of the earth as living is clearly shown, so that the maps often bear a resemblance to his anatomical drawings. Many of his maps were drawn to illustrate his engineering concep- tions. Among other things, he planned a tract on hydrodynamics, which caused him to study at- mospheric conditions and cloud formations. A magnificent drawing at Windsor shows a storm breaking over a valley, and exhibits his acute ob- servation of the phenomena of nature. Among the devices conceived by him, but not covered in this article by more than mention, are precursors of the airplane, the machine-gun, the bombshell, the tank, and the submarine. "With Leonardo begins the importance of drawing as diagram of technical and scientific conclusions and statements," so that scientific draughtsmen owe their professional ex- istence to him. Finally, the writer calls attention to Leonardo's theories as to the deluge and the end of the world, and publishes one of his draw- ings on this subject. With Leonardo the artist and the scientist are always interdependent. Andrea Pisano's Bronze Doors.- In The Art Bulletin xxv, 1943, pp. 132-153, ILSE FALK and JENO LA'NYI discuss the iconography of the scenes dealing with the story of St. John the Baptist on the bronze doors of the Florentine Baptistery, the work of Andrea Pisano. 17 of the 20 scenes on the doors occur in the mosaics in the dome of the Baptistery. 6 scenes from the story of the Saint were painted by Giotto in the frescoes of the Peruzzi Chapel of Sta. Croce in Florence; 5 of these are also found in the mosaics. Comparison of each scene as represented in the mosaics with those by Giotto and by Andrea shows that the sculptor was strongly influenced by Giotto. He adopted with little change the painter's version wherever there was a prototype. Otherwise, he followed the mosaic version, but he interpreted, simplified and enlivened it, as his teacher Giotto might have done. The Villa Giulia. - Central Italian architec- ture of the mid-sixteenth century - in particular, its most outstanding example, the Villa Giulia- is discussed by JOHN COOLIDGE in The Art Bulle- tin xxv, 1943, pp. 177-225. Julius III, Pope from 1550-1555, was a patron of the arts. "By pa- tronizing artists and giving them the opportunity to work out their separate styles, Julius III ushered in a new age in the long history of Roman</page><page sequence="20">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 197 buildings. . . . The Villa Giulia is important his- torically because it typifies the Julian revival. It is even more important because of its particular status within that revival. It epitomizes just that one aspect of the movement which was to be significant in the long run - its experimental char- acter. Of all the Pope's buildings, the Villa was par excellence the proving ground of young men and new ideas. . . . For this reason the under- standing of the building is a necessary key to the knowledge of late Renaissance architecture in central Italy." After describing the building as it exists today, and breaking up the complex into its component parts, Coolidge turns to the historical evidence. The building was constructed almost entirely under Julius III, consequently in the space of a few years. The building accounts are completely preserved. The author then proceeds to attribute to the architects who are known to have worked on the building their individual contributions. The first plans were drawn up by Vasari. Vignola was employed first as the foreman in charge of building operations and as an hydraulic engineer, but ow- ing to his ability and aggressiveness, he began to displace Vasari. The latter called in another protege, Ammannati, and worked with him on the fountain, while Vignola completed the main Ca- sino, where his characteristic style is chiefly evi- dent in the elevations. Eventually Ammannati was left alone to finish the work, in particular the construction of a loggia and the walls which con- nected the Casino and the Fountain and enclosed the main court. The plan of the Villa Giulia complex is based on the repetition of semicircles. The dynamic quality of this form was further strengthened by the con- fining walls, which forced one to proceed from one semicircle to the next. It may be that the main court was intended to serve as an open-air theater with temporary seats placed in the semicircle, and the elaborate walls of the courtyard incorporated in the stage set. Whether the Villa Giulia was ever used as a theater or not, there seems to be no doubt that it served as the archetype of the so-called Spectacle Palaces, and that it occupies "a key position in the development of Italian secular architecture of the Late Renaissance." Renaissance Sculpture. - GEORG SWARZEN- SKI presents the first of at least two articles on this subject in GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 149-156 (4 figs.). He comments upon the disproportion of sculpture to paintings in the Na- tional Gallery in Washington, there being only 128, as compared to 846 paintings. Furthermore, the sculptures are confined to Italian Renaissance, and later French works, especially of the eight- eenth century. There are, however, 94 examples of Italian Renaissance, and of its early period the representation is the finest in America, and one of the 5 finest in the world. The nucleus is Quattro- cento Florence, and is composed of famous works attributed to the great masters. 4 examples are illustrated - Madonnas by Agostino di Duccio and Amadeo, the portrait bust of Astorgio Manfredi by Opus Nini, and a bronze bust of Jacopo San- sovino by Pietro Aretino, the last 9 being in the Widener Collection. Mention is also made of Donatello's Mastelli David. AMERICA Peru. - There has recently been sent to the Editors of this JOURNAL from the University of Cuzco, Peru, a periodical entitled Revista del Instituto Arqueologico, bearing the serial number vi, 1942. A brief Introduction announces the es- tablishment at the University of a Department of Archaeology, to prepare Peruvian students for the study of their antiquities. This section began its work in July, 1942. The announcement is written by the Director of the Department, JOHN H. ROWE, who also on pp. 66-75 (4 figs.) writes on Historic Sites in Region of Pucara, Puno, describ- ing the results of excavations conducted by him in collaboration with Alfred Kidder, 2nd, and giving a select bibliography of the region. Luis A. PARDO contributes two important articles; (1) pp. 1-30 (60 figs.) on the Petroglyphs of the Depart- ment of Cuzco, listing and illustrating 59 examples, and comparing them with examples in other localities in different parts of the world, and (2) pp. 43-51 (33 figs.) cataloguing Stone Objects in the Archaeological Museum of the University of Cuzco, which include mortars and pestles, vases of differ- ent kinds, and other utensils. C. BtiEs (pp. 31-38) contributes a short article on the Study of Pre- Columbian Petropictography in Southern Peru, to be read in connection with Pardo's first paper. Other archaeological papers in this periodical include one by B. G. on Vestiges of the Incaic Period in Ancahuasi, and an important article by SOFIA ARREDONDO on The Ruins of Markansaya, which are Pre-Inca. This paper is divided into two divisions; (1) a discussion of the people re- sponsible for the site, and (2) a description of the archaeological remains. The rest of the periodical</page><page sequence="21">198 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY is devoted to historical papers. All are in Spanish. It is with great satisfaction that we greet this fine example of scientific archaeological work, and we eagerly await further numbers of this review. Excavations in Eastern Mexico. - Although the title, An Introduction to the Ceramics of Tres Zapotes, Vera Cruz, Mexico, is a modest and specialized one, this Bulletin 139 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, 1943, by C. W. WEIANT is the fullest report (i-xiv, 1-144 pp., 78 plates, 54 text figs.) that has been published to date on these important researches of the joint expedition of the Smith- sonian Institution and the National Geographic Society in 1939. The excavations are briefly described, with drawings and plans, but naturally the major part of the report, and all but the last thirteen plates, concern the pottery. Masonry and architecture are entirely absent. The deposits indicate four principal horizons, termed Lower, Middle A, Middle B, and Upper. Tres Zapotes is not so typical an "Olmec" site as La Venta, excavated later, and the excavations threw little light on the question "who were the Olmec?" This problem, together with those of the relation- ship of the Tres Zapotes culture to the Q Complex, the Archaic or Middle Cultures, the early and late Maya, Teotihuacan, Totonacapan, the Zapotec, Huaxtec and Aztec are briefly considered in the last and most important part of the report. The answers are seldom conclusive. The relationship with the Maya "Old Empire" was intimate, but little light is thrown on the question of Maya origins. Tres Zapotes was ap- parently, in its earliest phase, an early Middle Culture site, and may have been fundamental rather than peripheral to the Maya area. It is considered to have survived into "late prehistoric times," though entire absence of metal "argues against late occupation." Teotihuacan influence was slight. The resemblance with Totonac is obvious but not strong. On the other hand, there was a close cultural contact with the Zapotec through a long period, closer relations than with the later Mixteca-Puebla culture, and no direct Aztec influence under this category. The cultural contact with the Huaxtec was late. Tres Zapotes was contemporary with the Middle Cultures (Archaic) of the Valley of Mexico, but there was little contact between them; the influence of the site was rather to the South and the East. About two-thirds of the traits of the "Q Complex" are found at Tres Zapotes, but its relationship to this hypothetical entity is undetermined. The report is extremely well illustrated, pottery figurines comprising the majority of the plates. A large bibliography and full index add greatly to its value. Art of Northwest Coast. -In GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 175-182 (6 figs.), CLAUDE LEVI- STRAUSS takes up the study of the art of the In- dians of the Northwest Coast, extending from Alaska to British Columbia, as represented by the collections at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Its known development was not longer than a century and a half, and during that period 10 different forms of art flourished, the best, perhaps, being the Chilkat textiles and the Tlingit sculpture and dance headdresses. The Haida sculptors, too, had a "brutal and powerful" technique, while the Kwakiutl showed "sumptu- ous fancies of forms and colors." Attempts have been made to show the influence of China in the art of these peoples, or to connect them with the Polynesians, but in neither case with any success, for anthropologically the natives are of pure American Indian stock. In order properly to inter- pret these objects, it is necessary to rely upon local folk-lore, and Kwakiutl and Tlingit legends are quoted as important in any attempt to explain their real function. Mexican Colonial Painting. - MANUEL TOUS- SAINT, in GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 167-174 (6 figs.), calls attention to the remarkable collec- tion of Mexican Colonial paintings in the Munici- pal Art Gallery in Davenport, Ia., the richest in the United States, there being no less than 57 included, of which 8 are of prime importance, 10 others being only less so. Both of the two most valuable portray the Adoration of the Magi- the larger of the two is attributed by the writer to Sebastian de Arteaga, the smaller is signed by Baltasar de Echave y Rioja, with the date, 1659. The influence of Rubens on Arteaga is apparent. A Descent from the Cross, attributed in the local catalogue to Arteaga, is perhaps by Carrefio. Paintings of St. Peter and St. Paul are studio pieces of Echave Orio, on which pupils worked with the master. Several other paintings of later date are mentioned without being illustrated. It is hoped that a more thorough study of this collec- tion may be made at some later date. Popayin, Colombia. - HENRI LEHMANN de- scribes, in GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 41-54 (18 figs.) the Spanish colonial churches in this very</page><page sequence="22">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 199 interesting place. Only one church, that of the Ermita de Jesus, of the end of the seventeenth or early eighteenth century, survived a great earth- quake in 1736; the others now existing belong in the second half of the eighteenth century. All are baroque, but sober in exterior. They are, however, rich in wood carvings of a very exuberant type. The writer signalizes the pulpits in the churches of San Francisco and San Augustin, the altars of the Sefior de la Coronaci6n and Las Monjas del Carmen, and particularly those of Las Monjas de la Encarnaci6n; a Christ Child in San Francisco, and also a Christ on the Cross with Saints, in the same church. In the field of paintings the churches are extremely rich: these paintings reach their apogee by the end of the eighteenth century. A painting of Christ on the Cross in the church of San Francisco shows the strong influence of El Greco. A certain Jose Maria Burbano executed the Stations of the Cross for this same church, in 1798 and 1799, and his teacher, Bernardo Rod- rigues, a Last Supper, also in San Francisco, in 1780. A number of quite remarkable unsigned paintings are listed and illustrated, which reveal acquaintance with, and influence of, a number of European schools. Architectural Work of Thomas Jefferson. - In GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 89-106 (21 figs.), THOMAS T. WATERMAN attempts to bring to light the early activity of Jefferson as an architect. Unfortunately in 1770 his birthplace, Shadwell in Albemarle County, Va., was burned to the ground with all his papers and records up to that time, so such an attempt must necessarily be based on cir- cumstantial evidence. Three houses are attributed to him in this article: the Randolph-Semple house in Williamsburg, placed at about 1765; "Bran- don," in Prince George County, Va., the earliest part of which can be definitely dated in the same year; and "Battersea," in Dinwiddie County, Va., which was probably built between 1765 and 1770. For Jefferson's own house at Monticello, a number of preliminary studies were made by him, beginning in 1769, while the final plan dates in 1771. All of these plans are in existence. In addi- tion, the writer publishes two plans made by Jefferson (perhaps in 1773) for alterations to the Governor's Palace at Williamsburg, now in the Massachusetts Historical Society. His work shows the influence of Robert Morris's Select Architecture (London, 1757) and, later, of Palladio; but he improves on their designs in many ways. FAR EAST Importation of Chinese Silk in the Roman Orient.-In The Art Bulletin xxv, 1943, pp. 358-362, OTTo MAENCHEN-HELFEN presents fur- ther arguments to prove the Chinese origin of some fragments of silk found at Palmyra. The pieces were first identified as Chinese by Pfister, but this attribution has been questioned recently by Dr. Ackerman, who thinks that at least one of the pieces is East Parthian. Burma. -Smithsonian Inst. W'ar Background Studies no. 17, 1943 (iv, 21 pp., 16 pls., map) is entitled Burma, Gateway to China. The writer is H. G. DEIGNAN of the U. S. National Museum. Of interest to readers of this JOURNAL will be the sections dealing with the geography, peoples, and early history of the country. In the north, the Himalayan range stretches across the country, forming a natural boundary between Burma, Assam, Tibet and China (Yunnan Province). In the west, other mountains, forming part of the so-called Burma-Java Arc, also shut off the coun- try from Assam. In the east, there is a continua- tion of the Indo-Malayan mountain system. Culturally, strong relationships exist with Siam and Indo-China, but the culture is alien to China and India. This is doubtless due to these mountain barriers. Owing to the climatic condi- tions, Burma leaves much to be desired from the point of view of health, malaria and tuberculosis being the principal scourges. No less than 126 native languages and dialects are spoken, with Burman (which is allied linguistically to Tibetan) predominating-the alphabet is derived from Pali. The Burmans are of Mongolian stock, com- ing originally from Southeastern Tibet and South- west China. Other racial types are the Shans, who are of the same stock as the Siamese and the Tai of South China, and the Karens, who have responded most rapidly to European influence, and particularly to Christianity. These three are the main racial stocks, but there are numerous other tribal groups. The social life of the people resembles that of Siam -particularly significant is the emancipated position of women. Of the aboriginal inhabitants of Burma nothing is known - in fact, the most ancient inscriptions in the Burman language do not antedate 1100 A.D., and Burman history begins with Anawrahta (a contemporary of William the Conqueror) who introduced Buddhism, and established a dynasty, with his capital at Pagan, about 250 miles north</page><page sequence="23">900 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY of Rangoon. Many of the imposing and beautiful temples and pagodas of his dynasty still exist at that site. This dynasty was overthrown in 1287 by the Mongols, and an era of anarchy and suc- ceeding conquests from without set in, which lasted till the reign of Minkyinyo (1486-1531), who established the supremacy of the kingdom of Toungoo. This was continued by his son Tabin- shweti (1531-1550) who expanded his father's con- quests, while bis son and successor, Bayinnaung, a contemporary of Queen Elizabeth, conquered all of modern Burma and part of Siam. After his death in 1581, nearly two centuries of chaos en- sued, until, in 1752, a strong ruler, Alaungpaya, arose, and formed the dynasty that ruled over Burma till the final British conquest in 1885. The last part of the article is devoted to the three Anglo-Burmese Wars, and short sections on the British administration, the relations between Burma and Japan before the war, the Burma Road (which in places follows the ancient Tribute Road, already old in the days of Marco Polo), the battles at the beginning of the present war in the Orient, and the so-called "Co-Prosperity " in- augurated by the Japanese. The article is followed by a brief bibliography. Buddhist Bronze from South Russia. -AL- FRED SALMONY publishes, in GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 123-124 (fig.) a bronze statuette in the Archaeological Museum in Odessa, said to have been excavated in the neighborhood. It is obvi- ously of Chinese origin and Buddhist significance. The technique shows that it belongs in the T'ang period (618-906 A.D.) and probably represents the Bodhisatva Balakitisvasa. It was undoubtedly brought to South Russia by the nomads of the steppes between that region and China. The nomads during the T'ang period were Turks, many of whom had embraced Buddhism. Other examples of Chinese sculpture in South Russia are known, and a plea is made for thorough research in the field of Buddhist art in the Russian pro- vincial museums. The Tribute Horse. -ALAN PRIEST publishes, in BMMA. n.s. ii, 1943, pp. 85-92 (6 figs. and cover design) a very important Chinese painting, recently acquired by the Metropolitan Museum. It is of the early Sung Dynasty, and bears striking resemblances to the work ascribed to Kuo Hsi (1020-1090). The subject is a procession with a tribute horse, passing through a mountain land- scape. While the technique is Sung, the subject, and the accouterments of men and horses, resem- ble those-in T'ang paintings. Consequently, in this painting we have a T'ang subject painted by a Sung artist, who, in his treatment of the subjects, and in the colors of his palette, uses methods al- most, if not quite, unique. There is no signature, and no evidence of ultimate provenance, except that it was acquired in Peking some years ago by a private collector. It is badly damaged, but has been scarcely if at all retouched. It is hoped later to publish this painting in a separate book, with abundant details. Kuo Ch'in Wang Textiles.- This important find, from the tomb of the imperial Prince Kuo Ch'in Wang, seventeenth son of the Emperor K'ang Hsi, who died in 1738 at the age of forty- two, and whose tomb was broken open by bandits in 1934, is the subject of two recent articles-by LINDSAY HUGHES in GBA. ser. vi, xxiv, 1943, pp. 129-148 (26 figs.) and by ALAN PRIEST in BMMA. n.s. ii, 1943, pp. 33-46 (22 figs.). Fortunately, most of the contents of the tomb, as far as the textiles were concerned, was purchased for the Kansas City Museum by its curator Laurence Sickman, who was at Peiping at the time the tomb was looted. One robe, known to come from this tomb, and one made up at a later date from material from this tomb, are in the Minneapolis Institute of Fine Arts, and two robes and a num- ber of large fragments are in the Metropolitan Museum. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has one fragment from a bolt of material in Kansas City, and other examples are in Stockholm. In all, 15 robes are known to have come from this tomb, of which Kansas City has 9 and the frag- ment of a tenth, together with bolts of brocades and damasks and other items, making a total of about 70 pieces. The origin of these textiles was attested by the existence in the tomb of the soul tablets of the prince. The collection was exhibited in Kansas City in the winter of 1943, and a further exhibition of Chinese textiles of great importance was held at Minneapolis in the spring of that year. Through this find it is now possible more ac- curately to date the ceremonial robes of China than hitherto, as these examples must antedate 1738, and some might conceivably be of the pre- ceding K'ang Hsi period. Miss Hughes in her article gives a very complete and sympathetic description of the various robes, accompanied with excellent illustrations, while Priest's article attempts the problem of the chronology, dealing not only with this specific find, but with the entire subject. He suggests that at least 2, if not 3, robes</page><page sequence="24">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 201 from this find were made for K'ang Hsi himself, and others for Yung Cheng. U.S.S.R. Excavations at Khwarazm, i940-i941. In 1940, during the fourth season of field explora- tions by the Khwarazmian Archaeological Expedi- tion of the Institute for the History of Material Culture of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., the chronological framework of the investigations was greatly expanded under the leadership of S. P. Tolstov.1 During the first three 2 years the work of the Expedition was limited mainly to the study of the early and the Aphrigidian periods, with only preliminary prospecting in the earlier and later periods. During 1940 3 most of the work was devoted to the study of prehistoric Khwarazm and to mediaeval monuments. In addition, the following objectives were followed 4 in sequence: 1 This report in Russian was received from VOKS in Kuibyshev at the Field Museum of Natural History during February, 1942. Under the supervision of Eugene Prostov the Congres- sional Library system of transliteration has been used, with minor modifications, for all proper nouns in Russian. 2The results of the excavations during 1937 were published by A. I. Terenozhkin, "Archae- ological researches in Khwarazm," Sovetskaia Arkheologia vi, 1940; the season of 1938 by S. P.

SThe Expedition consisted of thirteen members, under the leadership of S. P. Tolstov, IIMK, assisted by IA. G. Guliamov of the Uzbekistan Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. (a) To fill in chronological gaps so as to deter- mine the evolution of the Khwarazmian material culture. (b) To continue the investigation of the ancient irrigation network of primitive Khwarazm in or- der to elucidate its historical position. (c) To begin research beyond the boundaries of Upper Khwarazm, which had been adequately explored, into Lower Khwarazm beyond the Sul- tan-Wiz-dagh Mountains and in the area of the delta of the Amu Darya. The earliest monument studied during 1940 was the Upper Palaeolithic (Kelti Minar Culture), Site No. 4, at Djanbas-Kal'a, discovered in the previous year. An area of 200 square m. was un- covered and additional materials were collected in the weathered section of the site, which covered about the same area. A large communal dwelling with clearly defined boundaries was partly ex- cavated. The outline (22 by 16 m.) was roughly oval, formed by a polygon extending North- Northeast to South-Southwest. The dwelling was built entirely above the ground, upon a framework of poles and beams, and was covered with rushes. The posts (the pits filled with black ash and char- coal were preserved) formed three concentric circles, the outer along the periphery of the poly- gon, the inner in the shape of a square surrounding the central hearth, and the middle, in between. Clay was not used. Upon the posts rested the radial beams of the roofs. This was covered with a close net of poles. The plan of the fallen roof of the dwelling could be traced from the thick charcoal streaks resting upon the main cultural stratum. Carbonized rushes from the roof were found throughout the building. In the center stood a large circular hearth, 1.20 m. in diameter, differing sharply in type from the ordinary hearth disposed in several rows along the periphery. The special characteristics of this cen- tral hearth were: (a) Lack of household objects and kitchen remains; these were very abundant around the domestic hearths. (b) Completely different character of the ashes; the domestic hearths contained largely black and gray ashes and charcoal, but the central hearth yielded compact pure white ashes suggesting that the fuel had been completely incinerated. (c) Beneath the central hearth there was found a sandy stratum, 50 cm. thick, which by prolonged heating had become bright red. Similar strata of</page><page sequence="25">202 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY sand were found under the domestic hearth, but these were usually only 0.5-2.0 cm. thick. On the basis of these discoveries it was con- cluded that this hearth was used for ritual pur- poses and also that a perpetual fire had long been kept burning. Since the Kelti Minar Culture in general and at Djanbas-Kal'a Site No. 4 in particular could not be dated later than the third, or at the very latest, the beginning of the second millennium B.C., we must conclude that this may well be the earliest monument of fire worship in Central Asia and possibly in the Orient. This becomes particularly important in connection with the important r6le played by fire worship in Mazdaism, which was the predominating religion of pre-Muslim Central Asia and Iran. The perpetual fire of Djanbas- Kal'a Site No. 4 is a new argument in favor of the theory regarding the archaic character of the fundamental kernel of Mazdaism going back to the cults of a very primitive community and of such characteristic traits of this religion as fire worship, dualism and peculiar burial rites, all of which distinguish it from other ancient religions. Along the periphery of the dwelling there were located several rows of domestic hearths or fire- platforms. In the excavated portion of the dwell- ing (144 square m.) were 46 fire-platforms. The total number of hearths, including the unex- cavated and the weathered portions of the dwell- ing must have been at least 100. It was deduced that all these hearths were not contemporaneous and that their locations were frequently changed. It was concluded that the fire-platforms were originally arranged in two rows: one along the outer wall, the other 4-5 m. distant toward the center of the dwelling. There existed a degree of regularity in the distribution of the hearths within the sectors of the house formed by the radiating rows of posts. The central portion of each sector was usually free from fire-platforms. An entire area North-Northeast from the central hearth was also bare. To judge from the grouping of the fire- platforms and the finds, the entrance into the dwelling was in the middle of its short north side, leading through the above-mentioned zone free from hearths. That the entrance was not in the weathered southern portion of the dwelling was determined from the exceptional abundance and even distribution of finds in that section of the site, suggesting a continuous line of fire-platforms around which the finds were invariably associated. The character of the plan of the dwelling permits us to make a few conclusions regarding the social organization of the Kelti Minar people. The great number of domestic fire-platforms and the in- stability and mobility of the hearths of the Kelti Minar Period can be contrasted with the stable, structurally designed hearths in the large dwell- ings of the Tripolje, Anan'ino and Biskupinskoe Cultures. The Kelti Minar dwellings, still more archaic than the long houses of the Iroquois, resemble the communal huts of the Mandans, the Bikaizis [?] and especially those of the Andaman Islanders, which are similar not only in the circular plan, but also in the presence of the perpetual communal fire and the distribution of the surrounding domestic fires. The number of inhabitants of the Kelti Minar- ian dwellings must have been relatively large. On a similar basis the Mandan dwellings, averaging 11 m. in diameter hold 30-40 inhabitants, or 2.4- 3.2 square m. per inhabitant. Andaman houses, 14 m. in diameter each hold up to 100 inhabitants or 1.5 m. per inhabitant. On a similar basis the dwelling at Djanbas-Kal'a Site No. 4, having a floor area of 280 square m., must have been in- habited by 100-125 individuals. It is possible to attempt a reconstruction of the Kelti Minar dwelling both on the basis of the finds and by comparing it with structurally similar dwellings of primitive peoples. By comparison the height of the Djanbas-Kal'a dwelling should be determined as being approximately 8-10 m. The most common relation of height to diameter of round dwellings of such primitive peoples as the Andaman Islanders is 1:2, i.e. the slope of the roof is approximately 45 degrees. Such a construction is the most rational solution of the structural problem, giving: (a) Optimum distribution of weight in two directions, vertical on the posts, and oblique along the slope of the roof. (b) The slope of the roof is sufficiently great to facilitate the shedding of snow and rain, and not too steep to cause the slipping of the roofing. Poplars, one of the principal trees of this area of the Amu, were well adapted for the high posts of the building. The finds at this site complete and expand the materials from the excavations during 1939 and enable us to draw several new historic-cultural conclusions. Many fragments of pottery show a combination of stamped ornament with a red painted surface which supports Tolstov's contentions that in the</page><page sequence="26">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS o03 Kelti Minar culture the dominating influence, re- lated to the Siberian Neolithic and to the " Steppe Bronze Age," was combined with early Anau ele- ments. The oval plan of the Kelte Minar dwelling is also important because this type usually exists in contact zones between peoples inhabiting rec- tangular and round dwellings. For example, oval houses are found among the Arawak-Yamamadis in western Brazil and among the Carib-Bakairis living on the upper Xingu River in central Mato Grosso, Brazil. These tribes live north of the zone of rectangular house and south of the zone of the hemispherical dwellings of the Mato Grasso and Brazilian upland tribes.5 In Africa the oval type is encountered among the Mangbattu (Mangbetu), who live on the frontier between the Sudan where the round plan predominates and the Congo Basin where rectangular structures are more common. From a study of the construction, and par- ticularly the presence of a central hearth, sur- rounded by a system of posts supporting the central portion of the roof, it appears that the ancestral form of the oval Kelte Minar dwelling was the round house, with the characteristically constructed roof with a central opening. Like the Kelte Minarian pottery, this type of building was subjected to the influence of the rectangular dwelling connected with the culture of the Anau cycle. The pottery varied greatly, both in form and in ornament. In addition to the many ornamented vessels of the type described in 1939, there were found fragments of vessels, separate zones of which were covered with curvilinear ornament formed by intersecting arcs of a circle impressed by means of a sickle-shaped stamp.6 Of particular interest were the newly discovered boat-shaped vessels, thin-walled, deep cups, re- sembling an egg dissected along the horizontal axis. One of these vessels, once painted red, was decorated along the edge with a broad band of hatched ornament, divided by vertical lines into rectangular ornamental fields. Together with the boat-shaped vessels, there were also smaller, oval cups, of somewhat angular outline, unornamented or slightly ornamented. One of these cups had at its narrow end two conical protrusions, forming a 5 Artificial cranial deformation to elongate the head is practised by this tribe. (H. F.) 6 Most of these fragments were found 300 m. S. of the large dwelling Djanbas-Kal'a No. 4, on the site of a completely destroyed dwelling of similar type referred to as Djanbas-Kal'a No. 5. handle, reminiscent of the twin lugs on some of the anthropomorphic jars from Tepe Hissar and Kish 7 and the central European Neolithic, where they symbolized breasts. Although the boat- shaped vessels stand alone among all forms of Neolithic and Bronze age pottery found in the U.S.S.R., the angular-oval cups have some paral- lels among the Uralian Bronze age pottery of the second millennium B.c. which are reminiscent of Kelte Minarian types. Numerous fragments of large vessels were cov- ered solidly with "fir tree" ornament, with parallels in the Afanas'evo culture; in the Trans- Uralian cultures of the Shigir type; and a par- ticularly close parallel in the pottery of eastern Turkestan, collected by Sir Aurel Stein, associated with microliths also closely related in type to the Kelte Minar implements in the sands of the Yark- end Darya Basin, 45 kilometers from the river, and at the mouth of the Kuruk Darya. It appears, therefore, that the Kelti Minar culture emerges as one of the late Neolithic cul- tures with a microlithic tradition and with the area of distribution extending from the Aral Sea to Sinkiang. It was also apparently historically more or less connected with contemporaneous cultures in the Gobi area. The sphere of influence of the Kelti Minarian elements extended North as far as the mouths of the Ob River, and it is indi- cated strongly that the early complexes of the Shigar cycle of cultures were formed under strong influence of the Neolithic cultures of the Aral basin. The cultural impact of the Neolithic cul- tures of the Kelti Minarian cycle (in the widest sense of the word) is also strongly apparent in the South Siberian Neolithic, where it becomes mixed with the local macrolithic tradition and survives in the Afanas'evo culture,,iwhich had also possibly absorbed additional influences of later derivatives of the Kelte Minarian. To the South the area of this culture goes be- yond the frontiers of Central Asia, and includes northern India down to the Vindhya Hills in the South and Burma in the North. Unfortunately, the pottery of these areas has not been completely explored; it is, however, definitely in the cycle of 7 In the great temple complex dominating eastern Kish the Field Museum-Oxford University Joint Expedition excavated many anthropo- morphic vessels with twin breasts. These votive objects were part of the fertility cult whereby honor was paid to Harsagkalemma- the Earth Goddess. (H. F.)</page><page sequence="27">204 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY primitive pottery with stamped ornament. The flint inventories are similar to the subsequent types. In this connection there should be men- tioned the frequently described connections be- tween the tongues of pre-Aryan India, Dravidian and Munda, and the Finno-Ugrian languages, and particularly the Ugrian languages of northern Eurasia. Since the ethnographical map of the intervening areas for the periods after the beginning of the first millennium B.C. is sufficiently well known to exclude the possibility of any connection between the Finno-Ugrians and the Munda and Dravidians through the intervening wedge of the Indo- Iranian peoples, the historical roots of these con- nections must be found only in the earliest periods. Tolstov believes that the second millennium B.C. should also be excluded, a period during which the ethno-cultural unity of the Eurasian steppes from the Don to the Minusinsk area as charac- terized by the stable complex of the Srubno- Andronovo culture which finds no cultural paral- lels south of the Central Asian steppes became crystallized. On the other hand, the fact that the Upper Palaeolithic cultures of the extensive terri- tory lying between northern India and the mouth of the Ob River in Siberia are typologically and chronologically similar indicates that the Upper Palaeolithic period was decisive for the process of emergence of Indo-Ugrian parallels, and that the Aral Sea area was one of the most important links. Furthermore, the line drawn from the mouths of the Indus to the Helmund, along the Hari Rud and the Murghab rivers and, further on, along the Irtish, Turgai, and possibly the Emba rivers in Trans-Uralia, is the straightest and the most accessible route for Indo-Uralian relations. The only argument against the accessibility of this route, the presence of many deserts, can be now overruled through the discovery of the rich water supply of this area which extended to the zones of the neighboring rivers during the pre-agricultural period. Apparently this line, and not the difficult mountain passes of the Hindu Kush and the Pamirs, was the most important axis for the processes of ethno-cultural consolidation of the ancient tribes of India, Iran, Central Asia and eastern Europe. These were responsible for the appearance of common traits in the languages of pre-Aryan India and pre-Indo-European eastern Europe, and later on for the ethnographical forma- tion of the eastern group of the Indo-Europeans. The exceptionally rich flint inventories from this site were further enriched during 1940. In addition to white and brown flint of excellent qual- ity, many implements of various varieties of jasper (yashma) were excavated. The implements in- cluded microlithic blades, scrapers, burins, long scrapers, perforators, arrowheads with one barb flaked only on one side and made from flakes, flint points with biface flat retouching, the latter type being typical for the Uralian and Siberian Neolithic. Some larger crude retouched knife-like laminae were also found, as well as polished, flat slate knives with rounded working edges. It was impossible to determine the form of the few frag- mentary large polished greenstone implements (axes?); it is certain, however, that these were not perforated axes. Bone implements were represented mainly by many long cylindrical-conical arrowheads, some- times slightly grooved (belted) horizontally. In addition, there came to light two large bone im- plements, requiring extensive reconstruction, but apparently handles for flint inserts. Many flat polished sandstone tablets were found around the hearths, in association with a quantity of yellow and red paints. Ornaments were represented abundantly by beads and pendants of shells, colored stones, and bird bones. Cylindrical shell and bone perforated beads predominated, together with oval beads perforated at one end; flat, stone and bone pend- ants, and flat half shells perforated near the margins. Of great interest were the details connected with the location of the cultural stratum. The dwelling was located upon a sand dune, upon the stamped- down summit of a sandhill (barkhan), facing with its steep concave side to the North. After the dwelling was destroyed by fire and then aban- doned, it was covered by sand, which formed several hillocks during the lifetime of the other similar dwellings nearby. The relief of these hillocks had been preserved by the thin, clayey crust formed over them during a flood from nearby lakes which had apparently occurred about the beginning of the first century B.C. The concatenation of these data suggests that during the period from the third to the second millennium B.c. the direction of the prevailing wind in this area was the exact opposite of that found at the present time. Since the prevalent northwestern winds are now determined to a large degree by the extensive area of the Aral Sea, it is probable that during the earlier period the</page><page sequence="28">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 205 situation differed greatly from that of today, the sea being then either much smaller or having con- sisted of a series of large lakes and marshes in the area of the joint delta of the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya. New information has also been secured relating to the later stages of Khwarazmian history. To the northeast of Angka-Kal'a, Tolstov discovered a badly weathered site of the Bronze age (Taza- bagh-yab culture), yielding some excellent speci- mens of the richly-ornamented, flat-bottomed ware. At this time it is possible to establish the sequence of the Kelti Minar, the Taza-bagh-yab and the Amirabad cultures. The middle cultures preserved, together with the new elements linking them with the Srubnaia and Andronovo cultures, many peculiarities of the Kelte Minar ornamenta- tion, and at the same time had the protrusion on the bottom typical of the Amirabad culture, which was most richly represented. Many new sites of this culture were discovered in the sandhill area northeast of Narindzhan, between the ruins of Kosh Parsan and Yakke Parsan. A continuous line of sites was found along the southern edge of the depression to the north of the Djanbas-Kal'a prominence, a few kilometers to the east of Djanbas-Kal'a Site No. 4. Similar sites were also discovered along the great canal south of Bazar- Kal'a. Of particular interest were the two sites discovered by IA. G. Gulianov: (a) Djanbas- Kal'a, No. 6, in which was found an untouched cultural stratum of the Amirabad culture; and Djanbas-Kal'a, No. 7, containing the well pre- served remains of a dwelling of that period. The rectangular clay dwellings of the Amirabad period, which are attributed to the period from the eighth to the seventh century B.C., retained com- pletely the character of communal houses. The "Great House" of 1)janbas-Kal'a, No. 7 parallels the slope of the prominence to the south on the depression, and like the Djanbas-Kal'a No. 4 dwelling was built upon a sand dune. This dwell- ing was 77 m. long and 20 m. broad. The walls were 1.5-2 m. thick. An interior wall divided the dwelling into two parallel corridor-like apart- ments, 5 and 10 m. wide. This type of "Great House" is connected generically with the Kuzel- igyr gorodishche, discovered by the members of the Expedition during 1989 at Cherman Yabe. This latter was the most ancient type of gorodish- che with a "dwelling wall." On the basis of the pottery, which was wheel-made with horizontally- notched surface reminiscent of the Achaemenid metal vessels and vessels depicted upon Achaemenid bas-reliefs, as well as Anau III pot- tery, associated with many Scythian arrowheads of a relatively early type, the Kuzeligyr gorodishche was attributed to the Achaemenid period, fifth to fourth, or possibly sixth to third century B.C. It must be recorded that during joint excava- tion with IA. G. Gulianov of the Amirabad cul- ture sites near Narindzhan, Tolstov found, in association with the late Amirabadian pottery, a few forms typical of the culture of "gorodishches with dwelling walls." For example, the rims of the vessels were straight and tall, the outer surface protruding beyond the walls of the vessel in such a way that the transition from the rim to the wall formed a rectangular channel. This furnishes us with a direct transition from the Amirabad cul- ture to the highly developed culture of "gorodish- ches with dwelling walls" which, in its turn, is connected through its pottery with the Kanguy culture of the third century B.C. to the first century A.D. In this way we have succeeded in tracing a continuous chain of monuments from the Neo- lithic to the Hellenistic. In the following pages we shall see that this chain continues. Although the Hellenistic sites were not included in the main objectives of the 1940 Expedition, a few significant facts must be mentioned. The dating of the Great Guldursun fortress, described by A. I. Terenozhkin in 1937 as a mediaeval monument, should be reexamined. This fortress is now attributed to the Hellenistic period and belonged to the Kanguy-Kushan culture. The strong walls were built of antique brick, and re- tained traces of embrasure of ancient type and many walled-in arches which apparently once led to the close-set towers, destroyed during later reconstruction. During the Kanguy-Kushan period great Guldursun was a city. Many mounds in the court- yard of the Gorodishche were remains of buildings containing red pottery and many Kanguy- Kushanian figurines. At the same time only isolated specimens of mediaeval ware were found. This immense ancient fortress, which was partly ruined, was modernized during the Middle Ages, probably during the twelfth or thirteenth centu- ries. Of the double walls, only the outer, thicker and better preserved, had been retained, together with the clay foundation of the inner wall serving also as a corridor between the walls. The em- brasures of the outer wall were filled. The ancient</page><page sequence="29">206 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY walls were covered with an outer facing of clay. In place of the old towers, many of which had been torn down or reused as foundations, new towers, set much farther apart, were erected. Opposite and in front of each wall tower was erected a second tower connected with it by a bridge. The absence of traces of intensive life upon the Gorodishche suggested that during the epoch of the Khwarazm-Shahs this fortress had a merely strategical value. Important new data were obtained regarding the antique "house fortress" of Djildik-Kal'a. From the 1939 study of the utilization of sand as building material in the socles of the house at Aiyaz-Kal'a, No. 3, of Kunerli-Kal'a and of the walls at Zamakhshar, new evidence for the study of this type of structures was obtained. The socle of Djildik-Kal'a was a very complex structure. It consisted of a series of brick walls perpendicular to the sides of the castle, forming a series of cor- ridor-like passages, filled with layers of unbaked bricks separated by strata, 10-19 cm. thick, of white, alluvial sand. On the outside this con- struction was covered with a brick shell. Similar masonry, striated with sand, had been discovered in the foundations of the "House of Fire" of Djanbas-Kal'a during 1939. The basement (socle) of Djildik-Kal'a appeared to have been con- structed in accordance with the building technique which was as common for the antique period in Khwarazm as the solid sand socles described in connection with Aiyaz-Kal'a. By comparing the series of Khwarazmian monu- ments with sand or sand-and-brick socles with the monuments of the Amirabad, and, possibly, the earlier periods, we can advance the hypothesis that this structural form, specific for Khwarazm, is a continuation and elaboration of the primitive tradition of building upon sand dunes traceable from the Neolithic period. The Kelte Minarian house in Djanbas-Kal'a, No. 4, the Amirabadian house in Djanbas-Kal'a, No. 7, the Achaemenid Gorodishche Kuzene-Chiz, the Kanguyan "House of Fire" in Djanbas-Kal'a, the Kanguy-Kushan- ian "house-castle" in Kunerli-Kal'a, the Kushan- ian Aiyaz-Kal'a, No. 3, and Djildik-Kal'a, form a continuous chain of structures built upon first natural, later artificial, sand hills. The reason for this phenomenon was obvious: even now the wet, marshy, frequently saline soil of the Amu is an enemy to builders. During the earlier, pre-agricul- tural periods, when the large irrigation canals had not yet drained that plain, the situation was infinitely worse. In this connection Ibn Yakut wrote in the thirteenth century: "The soil of Khwarazm is bad and is located upon marshes with many places where water seeps through." A later period from which the Expedition secured many new materials has been named the Kushano-Aphrigidian period, attributed to the period from the third to the fifth century, lying between the epoch of the Kushanian culture (Aiyaz-Kal'a) and the flowering of the Aphrigid- ian culture (Barkut-Kal'a). To this period belongs a series of gorodishches, some of them newly-discovered, such as Lesser Kawat-Kal'a west of Narindzhan, Yakke-Parsan, northwest of Uy-Kal'a and Eres-Kal'a on the lower course of the Kelti Minar Canal. Other gorodishches discovered previously, but de- scribed, include Toprak-Kal'a, which was first investigated by Tolstov in 1938, and Kosh Parsan, Nos. I and 2, first visited by Terenozhkin in 1937. These monuments vary both in type and in period. Eres-Kal'a and Toprak-Kal'a, to which must also be added Kirk-kiz-Kal'a, are all towns founded during the Kushanian period, but con- tinuing a full-fledged existence during the early Aphrigidian period down to the fifth or sixth century when they fell into decline. The two Kosh- Parsans, Yakka Parsan and the lesser Kawat- Kal'a, are early Aphrigidian castles, apparently built not earlier than the assumption of power in Khwarazm by the Aphrigid dynasty, not earlier than the end of the third to the beginning of the fourth century A.D. Toprak-Kal'a Gorodishche yielded many coins, mainly of the early Aphrigidian period. Many Kushanian coins were also found. Late Aphrigid- ian coins, common on the surrounding mounds, were rarely unearthed. A shaft sunk in the Gorodishche disclosed that this site, greatly damaged by salt marsh vegetation, had a cultural stratum 4 m. thick, in which there could be discerned 10 cultural horizons, separated by well preserved clay floors, as well as by less significant stratifications. The lower horizons yielded typi- cally late Kushanian pottery. The upper horizons, as well as surface finds, included early Aphrigidian pottery, not later than the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century. Thus the cultural strata at Toprak-Kal'a embrace no more than four cen- turies. The ground plan of the Gorodishche was in the form of a regular rectangle, 450 by 270 m., ex- tending North to South. The Gorodishche is sur-</page><page sequence="30">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 207 rounded by badly preserved thick walls of antique brick with many square wall towers. The north- western corner of the fortress, occupied by the extensive castle of the ruler, consisted of a court- yard, 180 by 180 m., with a complex ground plan and with a majestic three towered dungeon, con- taining many vaulted apartments. This dungeon was preserved to the height of 20 m. The southeast corner of the castle was adjoined by the remains of an extensive complex of buildings grouped around a very large rectangular building with double walls separated by a passage, which to the south was adjoined by a long corridor leading toward the main street of the Gorodishche. The presence of a quantity of white ashes within the rectangular building, as well as the general plan, reminiscent of the plan of the fire temple in Shapur, suggested that this was the city temple. The central building of the temple was com- pletely surrounded by a group of elongated corridor-like structures, of which only traces have been preserved. The entrance to the southern corridor of the temple was adjoined by a square yard surrounded by a portico of columns. The angle formed by the castle, the temple group, and the eastern wall of the settlement was occupied by a square devoid of building remains, supposedly the bazaar. The residential part was bisected by a street leading from the South gate to the castle. On both sides of this street, separated by sym- metrical alleys, were located 10-12 city blocks. Each block was a continuous subdivision into houses, of adjoining rooms, as many as 120 or even 900 in each block. In the center of practically every block stood a raised section, frequently in the shape of a brick platform. Tolstov considered them to be the remains of central towers, the prototype of Aphrigidian Koshk, occupying the middle of each block. The general picture of the late phase of the early Khwarazmian city has now been disclosed and once again excavations concur with literary sources which state that at this period this Central Asia town consisted of a group of large, family dwelling communities associated with an archaic type of social organization. In general, this was the same social organization as that of a fortified Kanguyan settlement of the Djanbas-Kal'a type, retaining even such traits as the division of the city into two quarters by means of a street. The new discoveries were the mighty three- towered castle dominating the city, and the gigan- tic estate-mansion, dwarfing even the large family dwellings of the shahristan. The architectural composition of Toprak- Kal'a, with its towers of dwelling blocks, the castle of the ruler, and the vertical treatments of the central building, are closely associated with architectural forms of the ancient East. Thus, the development of the late Classical architecture of Khwarazm followed the course passed many centuries before by the architecture of the ancient Duab. It is characteristic that large castles analogous to those at Toprak-Kal'a have been found on other gorodishches of the period, at Eres-Kal'a and Kirk-kiz-Kal'a, in contradistinc- tion to the earlier gorodishches of the Bazar-Kal'a type in which the citadel is devoid of habitations, serving as a refugium and a place of communal meetings and rites, as in the case of the House of Fire at Djanbas-Kal'a. It is impossible to reconstruct the internal plan of the Eres-Kal'a Gorodishche, with the exception of the castle, because the sand dunes completely covered the site. The outer plan, however, differed from that of Toprak-Kal'a. The outline of the Gorodishche was that of a sector of a circle, the straight side being formed by a wall adjoining the central castle, and the curved side by a semi- circular wall with many towers. The decline of city life was expressed clearly in the Toprak-Kal'a settlement. During the fifth to the sixth century a sharp decline in crafts was observed: for example, the pottery became coarser. A strong admixture of coarse sand is found in the clay used in manufacturing storage vessels (khums) and other large pots. There was a great increase in coarse home-made pottery, made without the wheel. By the sixth century the town was abandoned, becoming a large necropolis. To judge by coins excavated in the surrounding countryside, life continued down to the end of the Aphrigidian period. The country castles of the Kushan-Aphrigidian period, fourth to fifth century A.D., were dis- tinguished by the following basic characteristics, separating them from those of the Late Aphrigid- ian period: 1. The dungeons were built of classical brick, the outer walls of unbaked clay. 9. The dungeons were situated in the center of the courtyards in contradistinction to those of the late Aphrigidian period, which were built in the corner near the gates.</page><page sequence="31">208 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY 3. The castle had a ground plan in the form of two or three concentric squares. 4. The inner and outer courtyards formed two terraces rising 1.5 - 2.0 m. each above the level of the plain; the highest terrace was crowned by the dungeon. 5. The central citadel of the most archaic of the sites (the Lesser Kawat-Kal'a) was not a single roofed-over tower, but was a hollow building enclosing a large courtyard once surrounded by various structures. The walls of this citadel (the word dungeon could hardly be used) were pierced by many high loopholes, like those of the classical fortification, but having square lintels like those of the Aphrigidian period instead of the earlier lanceolate loopholes. From this there rises a mighty dungeon, the walls of which above the socle are effectively decorated by semi-columns, surrounded by three squares of clay walls, which are highest toward the center of the enclosure, and lowest at the periphery. In general, these early Aphrigidian or Kushano- Aphrigidian castles, and particularly the castle of Yakke Parsan, which is located in the center of the courtyard, were reminiscent of Al-Biruni's description of the castle of Fir, near the old capital of Khwarzm, the city of Kyat, which he attributed to the fourth century A.D. "And [Afrig] has built his castle [Kasr] inside al-Fir in the year 660 after Alexander [of Macedon]. And they reckon the years from him [Afrig] and from his succes- sors. And this al-Fir was a castle near the city of Khorezm [Khwarazm] with three walls built of clay and unbaked brick (libn) one inside the other, exceeding each other in height; and exceeded them all the castle of the kings, as did Gumdan in Yemen when it was the resi- dence of the Tobas." The period of the fifth to the seventh century A.D. was the period of decline of city life in Khwa- razm. Toprak-Kal'a and other Kushano-Aphri- gidian towns became deserted, while Toprak- Kal'a became an extensive necropolis. The coins found at Toprak-Kal'a were numer- ous and significant. A series of Kushanian coins must be mentioned, also a series of Kushanian coins overstruck with the Khwarazmian tamga in the form of a Latin "S," and the numerous, largely early (group AX) Aphrigidian coins. Most important in the latter group is a silver tetra- drachm, obviously the earliest coin in the series, and hardly later than the end of the second or the beginning of the third century A.D. The obverse of the coin bears the effigy of a bearded king in a composite crown, being crowned by a schemati- cally delineated Nike; on the reverse is the typical Aphrigidian horseman facing to the right, with the Aphrigidian tamga to the left and behind the horseman, and with a barbaric imitation of a Greek legend in a semicircle above and a straight line below the effigy of the horseman. This coin undoubtedly forms the link between the Aphrigid and the Geraya coins, filling the gap which Tolstov had pointed out in a note 8 on a contribution by A. N. Zograf. Associated with the early Aphrigid- ian coins were found many smaller copper coins depicting a king wearing a characteristic Aphrigid- ian crown on the obverse, and a peculiar tamga in the form of a three pointed swastika-like sign surrounded by an inscription in the Khwarazmian alphabet on the reverse. Since coins of this unique type have been found only at Toprak-Kal'a, it is quite probable that they represent the coinage of a local prince dated about the fifth century A.D. A copper coin of Chinese type, with a square perforation, found on a hillside (takyr) near Toprak-Kal'a had a legend in the local alphabet (of Aramaic origin). The bad state of preservation of this coin made it impossible to determine whether this was an instance of penetration into Khwarazm of Soghdian coinage, or a locally issued coin. If the latter possibility is correct, then the coin should be dated in the reign of Shaw- shafir, middle of the eighth century, at the time when Khwarazmshah Shawshafir attempted to obtain a Chinese protectorate. Several coins of Shawshafir, already described, have also been found near Toprak-Kal'a. Since the discoveries made during 1940 filled many chronological gaps in the data collected during the seasons of 1937 -1940, an attempt can now be made to describe the chronological suc- cession of the various cultures of Khwarazm.
