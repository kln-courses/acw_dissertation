<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inigo Jones's architectural education before 1614 by JOHN NEWMAN Inigo Jones's position as the founder of classical architecture in England is secure. The series of buildings which he designed during his time as Surveyor of the King's Works (1615-42), from the Banqueting House in Whitehall to the portico of Old St Paul's Cathedral, testify to his thorough understanding and command of Italian Renaissance vocabulary, his employment of proportional systems and his ability to ensure the faithful execution of his designs. It has long been recognized that Jones's visit to Italy in the retinue of the Earl of Arundel in 1613-14 provided a vital formative influence on his subsequent achievement as an architect. His study of antique buildings and those of Palladio during this trip is recorded in the notes which he made in his copy of Palladio's I Quattro Libri dell' Architettura, since many of them are dated and clearly record his on-site reactions. Recently, Gordon Higgott has demonstrated that he had already examined antique remains in Provence when he visited France in I609.1 Higgott's main tool for establishing this fact was an examination of Jones's hand- writing, whereby he was able to show that he had made many notes in his Palladio well before the first dated series. The purpose of the present study is to build on this observation, in order to demonstrate the development of his architectural understand- ing and the range of his interests up to 1613. His annotations during this period are extremely extensive, amounting to the evidence for a fairly rounded self-education. These notes can be dated relative to one another with some confidence, but the evidence for dating them absolutely is sparse. Two things can be said with certainty: that he was in Italy for an extended period between 1597 and 1603,2 and that his copy of the Quattro Libri is the 1601 edition and bears an inscription in the corner of the flyleaf, written presumably by an Italian bookseller, 'I60o doi docati'.3 This gives the year of publication as the terminus post quem for the earliest notes in this book, and it seems likely that he bought it in Venice in the year it was published. At that stage, however, his interest in architecture was only latent. The earliest contemporary reference to him, in 1603, is as a 'picture maker', and from I605 masque designs survive which show his increasing skill in freehand Italianate drawing.4 He is most likely to have been drawn to architecture as a result of his youthful apprenticeship as a joiner, which Vertue records, on the basis of a tradition originating with Sir Christopher Wren.5 This tradition is given added plausibility by Jones's use in early annotations of English terms for mouldings, translating 'ovolo' and 'cavetto' as 'boultell' and 'casement' (see p. 40 below).</page><page sequence="2">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION Fifty books survive from Jones's library.6 Of these, forty-eight are in Italian, the other two in French. Twenty-eight bear notes by Jones. The weight of annotation varies enormously, from a scattering of a few words and underlinings to continuous marginal translation on page after page. The character of his hand shows considerable variety and it is obvious that he made notes in his books on many occasions over a long period of time. However, no volume carries so many annotations made on so many different occasions as the copy of Palladio's Quattro Libri. No note in any of the books bears a date earlier than 1613. For Jones's earliest firmly datable handwriting it is necessary to turn to his drawings for masques; one of these, relating to a masque for the Earl of Salisbury, is dated I608,7 another, for the masque Oberon, is datable to the end of I6Io.8 The lists written on these two sheets provide helpful dating evidence. In trying to identify the notes which belong to the period before I613 several criteria should be borne in mind.9 The displacement of one entry by another from its natural place on the page gives a relative dating. Jones normally placed his trans- lations and comments alongside the passage translated or the relevant part of an illustration. Entries displaced from their natural positions can be dated later than the entries which displace them. Jones's spelling, idiosyncratic though it was, does show one or two changes which have implications for dating: 'high' is a spelling apparently not found until the late i62os and I63os, when it largely replaced 'heaygh', 'heygh', and so on, and before the I63os the final 'e' of'are' was always omitted. But by far the most useful key to the identification of an early hand are certain letter forms. In I60I Jones was twenty-eight, an age when one might expect the character of his handwriting to have stabilized and to show little capacity to change. But during his lifetime two types of hand were current, the indigenous clerkly hand known as 'secretary', taught to boys intended for the professions, and the more fluent and less florid 'italic', which was either used as an alternative display hand, as italics are used in a printed text today, or was employed as their normal hand by certain classes of people, in particular aristocrats and women. The Earl of Arundel used a bold italic; Jones's pupil John Webb retained a fairly pure secretary hand throughout his life. Jones himself, helpfully for the historian, vacillated between the two. He had clearly been taught secretary in his youth, and his attraction to italic may be seen as an aspect of his interest in Italian culture in general. The many notes dated 1613 and 1614 when compared with earlier and later notes show that he self-consciously adopted italic while on his second visit to Italy. 10 Three letter forms in particular can be taken as diagnostic for this early period. The lower-case letters 'p' and 'r' occur in the notes in both their secretary and their italic forms. The secretary form of both letters is somewhat awkward to write, the 'p' having a descender written in two parts and the bowl described anticlockwise (t), and the 'r' being double-footed (V). Secretary 'p' and 'r' are found only in notes in a tight, neat hand which translate or precis the Italian text, with barely any independent comment, and in notes which are not displaced from their natural positions on the page by entries of another character. This very extensive group of notes can thus be recognized as the earliest Jones made. I9</page><page sequence="3">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 It is impossible to say whether Jones began note-taking on Palladio's text imme- diately in I60 , or whether, as is perhaps more probable, these earliest notes belong to a more or less concentrated period of study later in the decade. He certainly did not study Palladio in isolation, as many notes of the earliest character can be found in his copies of Vitruvius and Serlio as well. The inscription dated 1608 on the verso of a masque design for the Earl of Salisbury is in a hand which relates closely to this group of notes, except in so far as it is not confined to the margin of the page. This encourages a similar dating for these marginal notes, around the time when we first have evidence ofJones making designs for permanent buildings rather than for the temporary scenery of masques. His earliest surviving architectural designs, for a merchants' exchange in the Strand and for crowning the damaged steeple of St Paul's Cathedral, are both datable to 1608. 11 They look like the work of an inexperienced architect. Another noticeable characteristic of notes datable c. I608 is the consistent use of the secretary form of lower-case 'h', with a long descender normally looped at top and bottom ( ). This form was not so decisively discarded, but shortly after this Jones began to write lower-case 'h' much less consistently. The inscription on the drawing for Oberon made near the end of I6Io shows a decisive development. Secretary 'p' has given way to an italic form with a straight descender, the double-footed 'r' has almost disappeared, and the long 'h' is used only at the end of a word, while elsewhere a hybrid form takes its place, like an italic 'h' with uneven legs. An intermediate stage between these two examples is provided by Jones's notes on his drawing of the Pont du Gard, a structure which he examined in I609.12 The 'limping' 'h' is strongly present, but the secretary forms of'p' and 'r' still predominate. These changes from secretary to italic appear to be subconscious rather than deliberate. Very different is the contrast betweenJones's hand at the end of i6io and the self-consciously italic script characteristic of the notes he made while in Italy. Some more or less italic notes can be identified by their subject-matter as antedating the Italian visit, and a number of these can be interpreted as directly anticipating it, as will be discussed below. It is not possible to chart any significant development between the 'Oberon' style and the full italic hand, so it may be best to date the former I610-13. Before the annotations are considered for their content several points must be made about the significance to be attached to them.13 Jones annotated only five of his books during the period up to 1613. It is clear from the character of the notes that when he read his books he regularly used marginal translation as a means of assimilating what he was reading; so it is reasonable to conclude that where close marginal translation stops there he discontinued his close reading. However, there are many other passages which he clearly read more cursorily, where he underlined phrases or whole sentences, or made occasional marginal notes, but did not trouble to write out extended translations. There is plenty of evidence that he returned to many passages and illustrations again and again, correcting, modifying or amplifying what he had previously written; though he did not do much of this in the period up to I613. From the beginning he compared different authors with one another; in particular he often had Palladio's Quattro Libri and the Barbaro edition of Vitruvius open on the table together. Although his surviving library contains books on warfare, ancient history, philosophy, art history 20</page><page sequence="4">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION and art theory, all the pre-I6I3 notes are in books on architecture, except for a few in Vasari, and they are on lives of architects. There is evidence that Jones made study notes elsewhere than in the margins of his books. Most obviously there is the surviving notebook-cum-sketchbook preserved at Chatsworth in which he made his celebrated generalizations about the proper uses of ornaments in buildings. 14 This he inscribed on the first page 'Roma 1614', but he wrote his architectural comments in it back in London during the first weeks of 61 5, and the bulk of the sketches and notes can be shown to date from the I63os and relate to something quite different, his reading of Lomazzo. During his stay in Italy, in annotating his Palladio he made cross-references to two different notebooks, neither of which can be the one at Chatsworth.15 That he must have made independent notes which have not survived is obvious from the fact that virtually all the marginal notes in his books, naturally enough, relate to their texts. It is rather a matter for note that when he was in Vicenza he wrote notes on the flyleaf of his Palladio in September 1613 about the Teatro Olimpico, and again in August 1614 about the Loggia del Capitaniato and Scamozzi's Palazzo Trissino, none of them published in the book; so he was using his Palladio as a general topographical notebook. Cross-references exist among the notes to books which are not in his surviving library. Antonio Labacco's Architettura in particular is cited many times, on one occasion with the words 'as I have noted in his booke (P. IV. I29)', so he must have owned a copy; and he must surely have made notes in a copy of Bernardo Gamucci's Le Antichita della citta di Roma (1569), to judge by the many references to this book which he jotted in his Palladio.16 So the surviving marginal annotations constitute a substantial proportion of the study notes on architec- ture whichJones made at that time, but are unlikely to be their sum total. Furthermore, those datable before the second Italian visit have a certain coherence which suggests that they indicate with some precision the course of his self-education. In the exposition which follows I have deliberately quoted many of the notes at length, in order to give as direct and detailed an impression as possible of his develop- ing ideas. I have also been concerned to publish accurate transcriptions of as many as possible of his notes on Palladio while indicating the full extent and significance of the notes in his other books. References are given in brackets after each quotation, as follows: P. Andrea Palladio, I Quattro Libri dell' Architettura (1601), copy at Worcester College, Oxford.

Every effort has been made to reproduceJones's words accurately with all their eccentricities of phraseology and spelling, some of 21</page><page sequence="5">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 which have implications for dating his notes. In many minor respects my reading differs from the Oriel Press transcription of Palladio's Quattro Libri. However, I have taken the liberty of writing out final 'm' and 'n' in words whereJones used a contraction mark, and of modernizing his use of'u' and 'v'. In so far as he employed punctuation marks these have been transcribed, and line changes which amount to punctuation have been indicated by a slash (/). Brackets indicate letters supplied editorially in order to make sense ofJones's text; square brackets surround letters assumed to have been lost from the edges of pages through wear or rebinding. WhenJones began writing notes in the margins of his books three topics particularly interested him, the practicalities of building techniques and materials, Vitruvius's account of the principles of architecture, and Palladio's exposition of the five orders. His study of Vitruvius's account of the various types of antique temple and the examples illustrated in Palladio's fourth book cannot be much later, and at the same time he turned to Serlio to read his enthusiastic account of the Pantheon. Thus the polarities of Jones's architectural interests were established at the outset, practicality and a fascination for the antique. He probably began at chapter vii of Palladio's first book (P.I. io), which deals with foundations. Passing over the first few sentences on foundations of natural rock, he began to write in the margin systematically when Palladio got onto the digging of foundations. Some notes extracted the essential facts from the text: "the dich that is maad for the foundation must be most comonly ye sixt part of ye heaygh of the building". But others are no more than headings to guide him back to the text later: "[R]ules to know whether ye [g]round be fearme". He persisted in his annotation even when Palladio deals with a specifically Venetian problem, piling foundations in damp ground, and he carried on through the succeeding chapter (P.I.II) in which specific advice is given on the construction of foundations. His notes here amount to a thumbnail practical manual on the subject, though he did allow himself to note both halves of Palladio's sentence on forming a flat bottom to the foundation trench, "the ansientes Brickt yt" as well as "the modernes lay Bourds and quarters and build on them". On reaching the beginning of chapter ix, in which Palladio turns to the various forms of antique wall construction, he got no further than the second sentence, writing a marginal heading "Six maner ofwaales among ye ansientes" and then realized that his text no longer dealt with modern practice, so turned to Vitruvius in order to read about ancient methods at the fountain-head. Vitruvius in the eighth chapter of his second book (BV.83), where he deals with methods of building walls, distinguishes only two types of construction, 'opus reticulatum' and 'opus incertum'. Jones noted the contrast Vitruvius made at the beginning of the chapter between the beauty of the former and the strength of the latter; but he wrote no more until he reached Barbaro's extensive commentary (BV.83-85). Here Barbaro covers a good deal of varied ground, much of it of general and even specifically contemporary relevance, but Jones followed him the whole way through. Barbaro begins with a quasi-anthropomorphic analysis of the fabric of a building. Here Jones noted the definitions of Barbaro's technical terms: "Poggio Is the first part a bouf grownd &amp; is thicker then ye walles", "the Procinct is that wch girds the wall about in the middel"; and he also responded to Barbaro's simile: "The bones and sustayners ar 22</page><page sequence="6">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION ye Corner Pillasters", "the Openings or lips ar ye windowes". At the point where Barbaro passes on to his next topic (BV.84 line 2), Jones wrote a heading "of stones", and followed Barbaro's distinctions, first between squared and rubble stone, even if in an over-compressed translation: "Stones ar ether of equall angles and lines or els varried and unsertayne", then his distinctions of size: "great stones managed with Ingines. littell ons wth ye hand. and middeling". Over the following section he skipped lightly, revealing why he did so in translating Barbaro's last sentence: "thes stones ar not in youse but in Ornaments". The following section returns to practicalities and the construction of stone walls; Jones's translation at once became denser: "every Stone must be hole and well wetted you must know by the sound whether thes be hole or not", "those nue digged ar best thos which have bin in worke having druncke ye humor fasten nott", "som wth littel stones &amp; much morter fill ye foundations", "Imitat nature that in making of mountes putes soft stones amngst ye hard". And he also noted the sound advice to cut stones across the grain in order to avoid face bedding, and the suggestion that the foundations of colonnades should be strengthened with reversed arches. He read on through Barbaro's next long note (BV.85-86), but his translations became sparser and more random. Near the end, however, two technical points caught his eye, one concerning the protection of iron cramps in walls: "Iorne wth whighlede or Chalke is kept from Rust"; the other explaining how to form column shafts when ashlar blocks were not available: "the Casting of pillors in moulds of wood fill ye moulds wth rubech and much morter. Sum leave hart ofoke or of Brick for strength". Two lines further on he must have taken out his dictionary, for he underlined the words 'una lanugine' and wrote against them "a soft harines" (hairyness). He probably read on to the end of the book, for although he did not at this stage make any notes on Vitruvius's text or translate Barbaro's advice on the different types of timber, he did write in on pages 92-93 the names of the trees Barbaro mentioned: "firr tree" "Turpentine tree" "a pine tree or pich tree", and so on. 17 A single comment merited underlining here, one which naturally caught an Englishman's eye: 'I1 Rovere (he knew that meant oak) per esser spesso, nervoso, di pochi fori, e ottimo alle opere terrene'. 18 Two isolated notes of this earliest period in the copy of Vasari's Vite relate to these themes, practical and patriotic: against the passage in the life of Cronaca (VV. Ioo) which refers to regularizing a room out of square he wrote "you Cutt of ye Roote of ye Imperfection by makinge ye waall Thikker", and in the life ofBenedetto da Rovezzano he made a note (VV. 125) that Benedetto "went into Ingland and made a tome for K: ", knowing no more than Vasari that the monument concerned was for Henry VIII. Annotations of identical type, which mark Jones's first explorations in his library, occur against the text of Palladio Book I chapters xxi-xxv and xxviii and Book II chapter xii. These form a group concerned with the design and siting of houses. Chapter xxi of Book I (P.I. 52) deals with house planning. Jones found some difficulty in reconciling Italian practices described by Palladio with the English arrangements which were his own concern. The title of the chapter, 'Delle Loggie, dell' Entrate, delle Sale', relates only to its first paragraph. He translated the first of these words non-committally as "lodges", but did not note the statement that such rooms are sited at the centre either at the front or at the back of the house, for this did not correspond to 23</page><page sequence="7">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 any normal English practice. However the double-page spread of villa designs (P.II. 60-6) which he examined at this time must have made it clear that 'logge' were in fact columned porticoes projecting from the body of the house, whether in the centre (Villa Trissino at Meledo, II.60) or at the ends (Villa Repeta, II.61). 'Entrate' he did not translate at all; 'sale' he unwisely translated as "halls", for Palladio's sala is an upstairs room functioning, as the text makes clear, in a manner similar to the English great chamber. In his confusion he misunderstood his text, writing "Nex to the Lodge is ye haulle to wch all ye romes answer and ar ye first place nex ye loge", which seriously misrepresented what Palladio had written. His next note is closer to his author but surely misleads about English practice anywhere except in royal palaces: "Hales for festes triumfes playes maskes and weddinges and therfor must be larger then the rest to resceve many people". More useful were Palladio's recommendations as to the size and proportions of rooms. Jones noted his advice that loggias "must not be narrower then 10 fott nor larger then 20", and reduced his remarks on the best plan forms for 'sale' to the phrases "hales of 2 square yousd by Palladio" and "the nerer ye Com to a Square ye Better". The succeeding paragraph on 'stanze', that is rooms of less importance than the 'entrate' and 'sale' which occupy the axial spaces in a house plan, helped him to see more clearly the characteristic difference between traditional English room arrangement and the symmetry about a central axis which Palladio was advocating: "the romes on ye side of the halle equaly Comparted and beare the wayght of ye covering equally". He also translated the final sentence in full: "the fayrest maner of Roomes ar 7, Rownd, Square, a Dagonall proportion, a square and a third, a square and a half, a square and 2 thirds or too squares". Reading on in the next chapter, on pavements and ceilings (PI. 53), he passed over the various materials for pavements but paused to translate against line 9 "Pavefment good in Lodgis and Publick Places" (but too cold, Palladio makes clear, to be recommended elsewhere in a house). He then translated some miscellaneous precepts, on the need to avoid changes of level from one room to the next, on the use of false ceilings in small rooms to bring them into proportion, and on the spacing ofjoists one and a half"diamiter" apart. Chapter xxiii (P.I.53-54), on the heights of rooms, Jones took seriously. He translated the first few lines in full: "Ceeled Romes must be as heaygh as ye ar Brode. and thos aboufe the 6 part lower", "the first romes shuld be valted for beayte and agaynst fyer", "Valtes in Square roomes add the third part of ther Breadth more", "The valtes longer then large put the lengthe and breadth together devide them and of yt make ye heaygth". Palladio illustrates three methods of calculating room height on the basis of length and breadth, the first producing proportionately the highest room, the third the lowest, and to theseJones drew attention with marginal comments. He continued this earliest phase of annotation by going carefully through the ensuing chapter, on the measurements of doors and windows (P.I. 55). He briefly translated Palladio's comments on representational and practical considerations: "To make ye Prinsipall dore observe ye greatnes of ye building qualiti of ye parson and what thinges ar to pass throw yt", "a great roome hath more need of light then a littell onn", "yf windowes be littell ye roome will be darke yf to bige uninhabitable for could and 24</page><page sequence="8">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION heate", "windows all of a bignes though ye romes varry". But his main concern was to put down all the proportional relationships which Palladio recommended in designing doors and windows. Of the antique sources indicated or the prescriptions of Vitruvius he took no note; proportions which Palladio presents as merely his own preference he wrote down as if they were rules of thumb, as follows: principal door - divide the distance from the floor to the underside of the joist into 3 /2 parts, and let the height of the door be two parts and the breadth one part less one-twelfth of the height; doors of rooms - not more than three foot wide and six foot high (a slip for Palladio's 6/2 foot) nor less than two foot wide and and five foot high. And it presumably did not occur to him that Palladio's foot is a Vicentine foot, the equivalent of 14 English inches, so that some of the recommended dimensions sound uncomfortably small. As for windows, they are to be no wider than a quarter of the width of the room nor narrower than one fifth, and in height two squares plus one-sixth of the width; upper windows to be one-sixth lower than those below. The final sentences in this chapter concern the relationship of doors and windows to a complete facade, and here he noted all the main points: doors and windows to be in line with one another horizontally and vertically and miy have relieving arches over them, windows not to be placed close to the corners of buildings, surrounds to doors and windows to be not less than one-sixth of the width of the aperture. Ornaments of doors and windows, however, with which Palladio deals next, he left for another day, and turning on past the chapter on chimneys and chimneypieces, came to chapter xxxviii, in which staircases are discussed. Palladio begins his discussion with an excellent analysis of the problems which staircases present (P.I.60). His first point Jones captured well: "a hard Thinge to find place fitt for stayres and not offend ye Rest of ye Buildinge". He underlined the second sentence: 'Pero si assegnera loro un luogo proprio principalmente; accioche non impediscano gli altri luoghi, ne siano da quelle impedite', but his translation ("A proper place migh(t) be apoynted for stayres") does not acknowledge the serious design problem which Palladio is pointing out. Thereafter he did fuller justice to his text: "Three open Places is required in stayres / First ye dore through wch you assend/ The second ar ye windowes / The third is ye dore aboufe wch shuld open into large and places adorned". Of the final general point, that there should be due relationship of size between house and stairs, he also made a brief precis: "Stayres to the Bignes of the housse" Palladio goes on to recommend dimensions for the steps of staircases, and to these Jones paid attention, as he had done in the case of doors and windows. He noted (again without converting from Vicentine feet) that steps should be not higher than six or lower than four inches and in depth between a foot and a foot and a half. With "steps odd", every eleventh or thirteenth step should be a landing or "hafe pace". As for the various possible plan forms of staircases, Palladio briefly discusses each in turn and gives examples in antique or modern works, including his own, and illustrates them in three pages of plates. All this material Jones examined carefully. Against the text (P.I.6I) he noted the various types: "winding stayres round and Ovale wth ye Pillor in ye midest and wthoutt/ Thes ar yoused in strayte (i.e. narrow or confined) Places and ar hard to assend", "Stayres that ... ar winding and have ye stepes verry longe and have no Pillor in the midest", "strayt (i.e. not curved) steares ether in too Branches or square 25</page><page sequence="9">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: I992 wch turne in fowre Branches". Against the eight diagrams on P.1.62 and 63, illustrating winding stairs on round and oval plans with and without newels, and stairs in four straight flights up a central core and surrounding an open well, he wrote identifications with the aid of the lettered key and translated against the appropriate diagram the proportions prescribed in the text. In the case of circular stairs with solid newels, he noted, the diameter should be divided either into three parts, one of which is assigned to the newel and two to the steps, or into seven parts, three of which are assigned to the newel and four to the steps; circular stairs with open wells should be built with half the diameter given to the well and half to the steps, and the same proportions should be observed in square open-well stairs. He also translated two aesthetic comments, on the use of curved steps in the circular newel stair: "Thes Croked stayrs ar Bautifull and longer then strayght", and on the oval open-well stair: "Thes ar fayre and Comodious for all the windows com to be in hed of ye Ovall and in ye middell", though his peculiar wording suggests that the idea of a top-lit staircase was new to him at this stage. None of the specific staircases mentioned in the text can have meant anything to him except the stair in Trajan's column, which he duly took note of (P.1.62 top left). The 'altra bella maniera' of spiral staircase at Chambord, described at length and illustrated in the following chapter, was also unfamiliar to him at this stage, before his visit to France in 1609, and he merely wrote: "an admirable Invention of winding stayres 4 paire wch have foure enterances and assend one aboufye other". The chapter concludes with descriptions of three unusual Roman staircases and these he did annotate: "Comendable Invention of winding stayres in ye Portico of Pompeio. having no light but aboufe wer maad upon pillors that the light might equaly searve", "Bramante Imitated them at Bellvidere", "Triangular stares that Convay up to ye Cupolo of ye Rotonda". This last of course is the Pantheon, and its triangular stairs are clearly indicated on Palladio's plan, which he had presumably already looked at, although he had certainly not yet made any notes beside it (P.IV.75). This does not exhaust Jones's investigation of staircases at this early stage. His cross-reference at the head of chapter xxviii of Palladio's first book is to Vitruvius Book IX chapter ii and on the text of Vitruvius's chapter (BV. 349) he made a single note. The discussion here concerns the practical usefulness of Pythagoras's theorem in construct- ing a right-angle, at which he jotted nothing more than "square comodous to make stayres". But Barbaro in his long note on this passage (BV.350,352) diverged onto territory whichJones must have recognized. He underlined the sentences which sound like an echo of Palladio and translated them: "nether window nor nich nor Steares nor any openinge must be in ye angles of a housse wch oft to be most stronge / many severall steares Blamed for being an Impediment to al ye Buldind and many Stepes lade (i.e. load) ye house". The following sentences, which also rehearse material he had already read and annotated in Palladio, he passed over. He took up his pen again at the point where Barbaro returns to Vitruvius's text (BV. 352 line 6) - "Vitruvius will that we take ye mesure of steares fom ye squiare" - and describes a geometrical construc- tion (drawn out on the facing page) to determine the angle at which a flight of steps will be easy to ascend. His translation, based partly on the diagram, reads: "from ye Left Cast a perpendicular line devided in 3 partes and draw another on the Playne of 4 partes &amp; yf from ye hed of ye playne line be draune a line to ye tope of ye perpendicular ye 26</page><page sequence="10">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION degrees mad out ofyt will bee eaysye". Barbaro ends his commentary by remarking on the difference between a straight stair, of which the 'fusto' is the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle, and a spiral stair, which has a perpendicular 'fusto', regardless of whether there is a central newel or an open well. This too he noted. He annotated one further passage at this time, while he was mastering the basic principles of house-building. This was the discussion of the siting of a villa in Palladio Book II chapter xii. As usual, he picked out the practical points, and here again he showed special interest in building by water (P.II.45): "a bautiful and Commodios thing to build upon a river a Country house for Transportation besides on may esily waater gardines and other growndes". On the other hand, "still waters Igender ill ayres" and "water that hath an yll tast or is tinted nott good". He also noted Palladio's opinions on the benefits and drawbacks of a site in proximity to hills: "heygh and lightsum Places whear ye ayre is moved Continually by the wyndes and by faling of ye ground the moyst and yll vapors ar purged the people ar well collered and not trobled wth Gnates nor such vermin", "yll buldinge betwene hyles for many Causes", "ye reverberating of the sonne from sum neare clife lyke another soone". To bring his chapter to a close, Palladio observes that similar considerations dictate the siting of houses and towns, 'conciosiache la Citta non sia altro che una certa casa grande, e per lo contrario la casa una citta picciola'. Jones, without bothering with Palladio's reason for making this comment, phrased his translation with pregnant brevity: "The Cictti a great house and ye house a littell Cittye". On the pages preceding this chapterJones made his only annotations of this period on antique houses, though their relevance to the notes discussed above is not clear. Three explanatory notes relate to the section on the Egyptian Hall (P. II.42), where the plate is not immediately explicit, and one refers to the Rhodiac courtyard described in the chapter on the private houses of the Greeks (P.II.43): "that wch had on portico Bigger then ye rest and and (sic) torned tourds ye South". Jones made his first forays into the theory of architecture at least as early as this study of the practicalities of house building. Here of course Vitruvius was his principal mentor, though he seems to have read Barbaro's commentary quite as avidly as the ancient text itself. The importance he attached to a close study of proportion is already apparent; so it is not surprising that the first early note encountered in his copy of Vitruvius relates to proportion. This occurs at the end of an excursus by Barbaro on Vitruvius's discussion of the shared theoretical basis of the arts (V.I.i). At the end of it Barbaro comes back to the parallel made by Vitruvius between music and a study of the stars. In the margin at this point (BV.24) Jones wrote his paraphrase: "in musicke the(re) must be a proporsionatt distance betwene the low and heaygh / the same simpathy is in the stares / the ruels of arethermaticke that unite musicke wth astrologiy". He began his structured examination of Vitruvius's first book two pages further on (BV.26). Chapter ii begins with the famous dictum 'L'Architettura consiste in Ordine, in Dispositione, in bel Numero, in Compartimento, in Decoro, &amp; in Distributione'. Reading on into Barbaro's commentary, which immediately takes over from Vitru- vius's text and speaks of 'la forza dell'Architettura', he headed the margin of this chapter "the force of Architectture consistes of thes 6 thinges". And as Vitruvius goes 27</page><page sequence="11">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 on to define each of these characteristics, he flagged them up, writing in the margin against each definition "What order is", "What the Disposition is", and so on. In between, however, there were long paragraphs of commentary to read. Barbaro first plunges into linguistic philosophy, distinguishing between words with meanings that are absolute (Jones: "of them Selves") and relational words. Jones noted this passage. In the former class are words for substances: man, stone etc., in the second words which define relationships: "father master frend". In due course Barbaro explains the rele- vance of all this: the six architectural characteristics all involve comparison, and are thus relational, or in the words ofJones's translation, "This distinction good To understand ye 6 thinges for ye ar all Comparasons and Relations". Barbaro proceeds to explain how this analysis applies to Vitruvius's six characteris- tics, and Jones faithfully continued with his annotation. The first two, order and disposition, relate to the end in sight, order to the physical completion of the building, disposition to the objectives which the building is intended to achieve, as for instance protection from winds and sun. The one therefore is quantitative, the other qualitative. Eurithmia - Barbaro reverts to the Vitruvian word, abandoning his awkward 'bel numero' - is the quality in a building which gives visual pleasure; or, as Jones expressed it, "eurithmia quallity that Contenteth". Simmetria - again the Vitruvian word comes back in Barbaro's commentary - is the correspondence of parts within what is a finite whole: "corrispondence of ye partes wth ye holle (is) compartiment or simitrye". Decorum, says Barbaro, is requisite because what is done has to have authority and reputation, an explanation curtailed to: "Thinges doon withe autoriti Decorum". Finally distribution, which he effectively summarized with the words: "Thinges accommodated to youse is Distribution" (though by a slip of the pen he wrote "Disposition" and only corrected it years later). Against the next paragraph of commentary, a long-winded and over-complex analysis of'Order', he attempted to set condensed translations of what he took to be the key sentences (BV.28 lines I-I8); two of them make reasonable sense: "architetes order is when In a worke ofytes reson the being of on quantiti is first Putt and then another", "order is ye Dispencing ofthinges equall and unequall". His difficulties here emphasize the cramping restrictions which marginal annotation imposes on a reader who attempts to put down the essence of a complex discussion. Further down the page he spotted an important Vitruvian technical term and translated Barbaro's definition of it: "Vitruvios cales yt module yt rules all ye workes greatness" (really "greatnesses", a correction he himself later made to this note). Vitruvius's second term is 'disposition'. He wrote out a literal translation of Barbaro's contrast between this term and the one he had just discussed (BV.29 penultimate line): "order is disposinge of mesures to the Simitri and disposition is ordering ye partes to ye Place". Vitruvius's text now makes it clear that 'disposition' refers to preparatory designs: "The Idea of ye Disposition is ye ground Plot ye upprites and ye Purfile (i.e. perspective)". He read on through Barbaro's ensuing commentary (BV.3o), noting "The great Benifite of makying ye Purfile", as well as Barbaro's important point that it is through these ideas conceived in the mind and set down on paper that the architect achieves 'quello effetto scielto, &amp; elegante': "ofthes 3 Ideas wch ar formes conceavd in ye mind comes that elligant and selected effectte". Two pages 28</page><page sequence="12">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION further on the point is reinforced in a sentence of Vitruvius's text which he partly underlined, 'Queste nasceno da pensamento, &amp; da Inventione. Pensamento e cura piena di studio. ..' and translated "from whence ar borne thes thre Ideas/first thinkynge and what yt is". The intellectual character of architectural design is vividly conveyed in Barbaro's supporting note, the key sentence of which he rendered: "nature sheayes not thes ideas &amp; therfor have recourse to arte"; and when commentary at last gives way to Vitruvius's text again (BV. 33 lines o-I I) he found an inspiring definition of invention: 'E dimostramento delle oscure dimande, &amp; ragione della cosa ritrovata di nuovo con presta, &amp; mobile vivacita'. (Invention is the solving of intricate problems and the discovery of new principles by means of brilliancy and versatility: Morgan translation.) He underlined the whole sentence and wrote against it: "This what invention is". This was an important thread, and he did not let it go, even if for the time being he followed Barbaro's digressions. One such is on the disputed meaning of 'profilo' (BV.30). He noted Barbaro's conclusions, that the word did not, as some thought, mean "modell", and that it should be interpreted as "perspective" rather than 'scenographia'. Presumably the implied reference to theatrical productions caught his attention. The remaining terms he dealt with more summarily, resisting any further diversions into the commentary. In fact he did no more than translate definitions or flag them in the margin. Thus (BV.33) "Eurithmia or fayr number is gratous aspecte in composi- tion of ye members"; and (BV.34) "what Compartiment is or simitri", "Simitri is the Bauty of order as Eurithmia ye Bauty of Disposition", "what dicorum is". Where Vitruvius explains the appropriate uses of the different orders in temples dedicated to particular gods (BV. 3 5 lines I ff.) he merely wrote "examples of Dicorum", but further down the page Vitruvius's examples prompted him to jot down: "Dicorum in alicknes of ornament", "Dicorum in chusing ye Place to buld in", and where Vitruvius points out that rooms for different uses require different qualities of light, "Dicorum in takyng severall lightes for severall youses". Then he reached "What Distribution is" (BV.36), and noted Barbaro's commentary, which begins with an arresting "Com- parrason betwen the orrator &amp; the Archetect". Otherwise he noted only Barbaro's distinction between the different spheres to which decorum and disposition applied: "Distribution is in that wch is Profitable and Commodious'. All in all, his first reading of this fundamental passage was of a somewhat preliminary nature, and he would return to it later and get a good deal more out. Much further on, in his sixth book, Vitruvius reverts to these fundamental qualities of architecture, as Barbaro points out in his commentary (BV. 282) andJones translated: "vitruvius Reiterates that which is in ye first Booke" - and Barbaro adds the observation which he also translated, "the same Idea in orderinge Puplike &amp; Private Buildinges". Vitruvius's own text (BV.279) at this point introduced him to a sugges- tive new idea. This is that although buildings should be designed in accordance with standards of proportion, particularities of siting which may deceive the eye may demand deviations from proportional consistency: "so ye increasing and diminishing to ye nessety of ye Place that nothing may be desired more for Eurithmia". The architect must therefore proceed 'non solo per dottrina, ma per acutezza d'ingegno'. This was a challenging thought and he captured it with a telling translation: "no rule to 29</page><page sequence="13">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: I992 teach this but by sharpenes ofwitt first know the ordering mesures and from them take ye alteringe ofanythinge". Furthermore, as Vitruvius stresses, the plan is fundamental: "when the bredth and length is knowne of ye ground platt then followeth the apparato for bautye". One of Jones's basic tasks in approaching the practice of architecture was to familiarize himself thoroughly with the orders. This he did, not surprisingly, with the aid of Palladio's first book. Here in text and illustrations an authoritative account is given of the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite columns with their associated entablatures, pedestals and arcades, and the modular system that controls each, together with large-scale diagrams marked up in minutes of capitals, bases and other details. The text is largely a key to the illustrations, pointing out in particular the proportional relationship of part to part; but it also draws attention to sources in Vitruvius or antique buildings for some of the most important features. Jones followed through the text relating to each order right to the end and wrote virtually complete translations against the most appropriate parts of the illustrations. In this way he tried to make it easier to consult the illustrations with Palladio's explanations alongside. Only a few points need to be made aboutJones's early annotation of the orders. He made hardly any notes on the main body of chapter xii, which deals with general issues such as the tapering and entasis of column shafts and intercolumniation, breaking in with underlinings and marginal translations only towards the end, where precepts are given for the correct usage of pilasters (P.I. I6). Ignoring all the references to the use of pilasters in antique buildings, he concentrated on their proportions: "Pillasters never less thicke then ye thirde Parte of ye Spacce", "And thos in ye Corners too thirds for strength", and so on until the final practical dispensation: "Pillasters narroer in ye Side then in frontte to lessen ye Charge and to make ye walkes larger". In dealing with the Tuscan order he showed his inexperience by first translating a large stretch of Palladio's detailed exposition against the illustration of the Tuscan arcade (P.I. 18), then crossing his translation out and rewriting it against the large-scale diagrams of capital, impost and base (P.I.20), where he thought it was more relevant. In studying the Tuscan order he went beyond the text in two small points. Palladio states that he has taken the details of the order from Vitruvius, but Jones took the trouble to find the precise reference, Book III p. 142. He also drew attention to the two profiles given for the capital at the top of P. 1.20. In particular he wrote beside the more elaborate profile: "A/ noot this waufe Betwene 2 fillites variing from ye other agaynst yt". On the next page he found a larger diagram of this attractive variant copied, says Palladio, from the Theatre at Verona and other antiquities. He noted the derivation and added his own words of admiration: "this wave and fillett marked I insted of ye Ovolo and verry gratious. and ye Casmentt and fillet G for Cimaca of ye Plinth is not yousiall yt verry good", and he also drew attention to the way the base moulding here echoed the form of the capital. On the Doric order he began his translation in the margin alongside the text (P.I.22), but after the first paragraph gave up and rewrote his translation against the relevant parts of the first two diagrams. The second paragraph, which gives full details of the proportioning of the Doric base and pedestal, he translated in its entirety in the margins of the third diagram (P. .25). Turning on to the discussion and illustration of the capital 30</page><page sequence="14">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION and entablature, he began translating the text (P.I.26) into the right-hand margin of the illustration, but having dealt with only the capital already found himself writing across the bottom of the page. So, changing tactics, he translated the remainder of the text in the adjacent margin and on the diagram repeated against architrave, frieze and cornice the number of modules assigned to each, referring himself back to the full translation with the words "ye particulars is on ye other syde". By this time he might well have been losing faith in his technique of annotation. Turning to the Ionic order, however, he at last found an effective method. He translated the first brief page of text (P.I.28) partly alongside and partly against the appropriate parts of the diagrams of the Ionic colonnade and arcade (P.I.29-30). Of the discussion of the base and pedestal (P.I.3 I) he translated a single sentence beside the relevant part of the diagram (P.I.32): "This is the atticke Base wth a smalle Boultell under ye simbia", for this type of base had already been dealt with under the Doric order. The rest of this passage, dealing with the Vitruvian Ionic base, not approved of by Palladio, he translated none the less, beside the diagram tucked into the lower right-hand corner of P.I. 34. Two plates are devoted to the upper elements of the Ionic order. The first (P.I. 34) illustrates on a large scale the method of constructing the volute of the capital. Beside this he wrote a complete translation of the relevant text (P.I.33) as far as the point where Palladio describes how to form the eye of the volute, whereupon, since a large-scale figured detail of this is also provided (P.I.34 top left), he broke off with the words "The rest is Playne". That gave him room to translate Palladio's comments on the handling of the astragal under the volute, bulging as if with the effect of compression: "for yt is naturalle that a soft thinge shuld give waye to a hard". The final illustration, of capital and entablature together, also has its own text (P.. .35-36), which he translated straight down the margin of the illustration, ignoring the fact that the description works from the architrave upwards not the cornice downwards. The Corinthian and Composite orders raised no new problems, so he distributed his translations in the margins as he had done for the Ionic order. Against the illustration of the Corinthian capital and entablature (P.1.43) he wrote a full translation of the text, once again in reversed relationship to the illustration. On the parallel plate of the Composite order (P.I. 50) he wrote nothing at this stage. The various inconsistencies we have noted suggest that he wrote out his translations on the orders as part of the process of learning their details as much as with a view to creating a handy reference text. Later on, when he returned again and again to examine and analyse these illustrations he may well have regretted the way in which he had squandered their margins. Shortly afterwards he turned to Vitruvius's discussion of the orders. This is considerably fragmented, and Barbaro's edition provides no illustrations to this part of the text. Nevertheless his chapter on the Ionic order (III.iv) reintroduced him to the concept that proportions should be adjusted in accordance with the distance of the architectural element from the eye. This comes out in the increase in height of architraves set on columns of increasing height, an increase not only in real terms but also proportionately. He underlined the passage with unusual care and faithfully translated the first two examples (BV. 158): "yfye Collomes be 12 or 15 foot heygh ye Thiknes of ye Architrave must bee halfe of ye Thiknes of ye Collombe beelowe Yf yt 3I</page><page sequence="15">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: I992 Pass 15 foote to 20 ye Collombe must be Parted into 13 Partes and ye heygh of ye Archittrave must be on of them; and so forth". He concluded with the highly characteristic generalization, suggested but not spelt out in the abbreviated text of Vitruvius printed by Barbaro at this point: "Allwayes In ye members of ye Com- partiment Reason must adde and supplie". He continued writing as Vitruvius rehearsed the details of the form and proportion of the architrave (BV.I58-59), but reduced his notes to a mere indication of the change of topic as Vitruvius goes on to discuss pediments, dwelling only on the surprisingly large size recommended for acroteria, "ye Accroterii at ye ends must be as heygh as ye frontispice (i.e. pediment) in ye midell and ye midelmost on 8th mor then ye Corner ones". Vitruvius's discussion of the other orders did not entice him into annotation at this stage, though he was intrigued by some ofBarbaro's derivations of the technical terms for parts of the Doric order (BV.I45), the "Corona for Binding ye Building as a Crownne", and the sima (gola schiacciata) "flat gollett lyke a gootes nose". The one substantial exception relates to Barbaro's discussion of the design of the Corinthian capital (BV. I 55). This starts with the observation that the height of the capital equals the diameter of the column, but that Vitruvius's text is not in line with the evidence of many well-proportioned antique capitals in including the abacus in this height. This discrepancy set his pen to work: "Barbaro Confesseth That ye Capitel as described by Vitruvious is to short by the Abbaco", and he continued to make notes on Barbaro's text and diagram. In his folio copy of Serlio he found a diagram which illustrated the point (Sf. III. I25, arch at Pola); beside the enlarged detail of the capital he wrote: "This Capitell C is heygher then ye [di]ameter of the Pill[ar] by the Abbacco w[ch] is verry gratous [and] ever to be Immitat[ed]". It is clear that he had also been reading Serlio's text on the facing page, which discusses at length Vitruvius's recommended proportion and its relationship to Callimachus's derivation of the Corinthian capital from a foliage-enclosed basket covered with a tile. The final group of entries which clearly fall into the first phase of note-taking relates to antique temples. In the first instance this was a work of correlation, between the. theoretical chapter with which Vitruvius opens his third book and the examples illustrated in Palladio's fourth book; a reading of Serlio's chapter on the Pantheon was also included. The starting point once again was proportion. Vitruvius begins (BV.io8) by stating that the design of temples is based on "compartment", or symmetry, asJones would later call it. He translated the next sentence: "Compartment taken from proportion". And Vitruvius's succeeding point, the comparison between a properly designed temple and a well-proportioned man (BV. IO9), he also took down: "the boddi of man well proporsioned Is the paterne for proportion in buildinge", and a little further on the famous images of the homo ad circulum et ad quadratum: "the round figure forms the Bodi of man / and lykewyse the square". As usual he was reading Barbaro's commentary as well and could not resist noting Philander's criticism, which Barbaro endorsed (BV. I Io), of Vitruvius's claim that the breadth of a man's chest is one quarter of his height: "that wch vitruvious sayth cannot be yt the Brest is the fourth partte". A little further on (BV. II2-13), Vitruvius's comments on perfect numbers caught his attention: "Plato afermes tenn to be a parfayt number", "The mathemati- sians say 6 to be a perfayt number"; though once again Barbaro's commentary 32</page><page sequence="16">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION threatened to lead him off the point, as where (BV. 112 line 7) he drew attention to the commentator's definition of "a Perfayt thing". The quarry at the end of this trail was Vitruvius's definition of the seven types or aspects of temples (BV.I I5), which he listed in the margin as: "I in antis. face in Pillasters 2 prostilos front in Collomes 3 front in Culloms wthin &amp; wthoute" (later corrected to "Amfiprostilos front in Culloms before &amp; behind") "4 winged a boutte", that is, "peripteros", as he later added, "5 falce winged of too orders 6 winged of too orders or dubble, 7 the open or uncovered". He was keen to fix these types in his mind, and repeated the list with some additional explanation on subsequent pages. Against Barbaro's first diagram (BV.I I7) he repeated the first category, "in antis / front in pilasters", not apparently appreciating that "in antis" refers to columns set between pilasters. Against the second, prostyle, he translated the Vitruvian text (BV. 119), little helped by either Barbaro's commentary or his diagram, with the decidedly misleading sentence: "This aspect of front in collomes called Prostilos hath all ye Thinges of the front in pillasters. but hath 2 pillors in the corners agaynst the pillasters". The characteristics of the next two types were better conveyed to him by the text and he wrote: "3 / The aspect anfiprostilos is the same wth the Prostilos but obsearves the same maner of Pillors and frontispis within" (or rather 'behind', as he later corrected his mistake), "4 / Peripteros. winged aboutte. hath att each frontt six pillors &amp; on the sides I wth the corners', '5 / Psudadipteros that is false winged dubble", "6 / Dipteros duble winged", and finally (BV. 12I) the hypethral temple: "7/ hipteros the open or uncovered" (a misspelling which may indicate his ignorance of Greek). In his next chapter Vitruvius turns to a different form of categorization of temples- by column-spacing, a feature whichJones was noting about the same time as part of his study of the orders in Book I of Palladio. Nevertheless he wrote in the margin the definition of each category (BV. I23-30): "Picnostilos / Space of on Diamiter and a halfe", "Sistilos / Space of 2 diamiters", "Diastilos 3 diam: Betwix the Collumes", "Areostili/Large spaces", and finally "Eustilos/2 diamiters and a quarter". He did not, however, take note of any of Vitruvius's comments on the various categories, not even to register 'eustyle' as the most approved column-spacing. Similarly for the remainder of the chapter (BV. 131-33) he noted only general points relating to temple design as a whole: "The reason why Temples weare winged about wth pillors", "The corner Pillors must be bigger then ye others ye 50 Part of ye Diami:", "a rule for the diminishing of pillors under the Capitelle". He read Barbaro's commentary on this passage, as is indicated by sundry marginal signs, but only once was he moved to write a note; but it is a particularly significant note, among his very few expressions of personal opinion in this early period. In commending Vitruvius's categorization of temples (BV.IIS) Barbaro compares this range of architectural expression to the various manners of speaking whereby an orator can appeal to his hearers. As Barbaro goes on elaborating his point Jones exclaimed: "An exelett Comparason of Barbaro betwene the Orrator and the architecte". In the following chapter Vitruvius turns to practical precepts on building temples, some of whichJones made a note of: "in the winged aboute as many spases as be in the front so many dubble must be on the sides for yfyou shuld dubble ye Pillors ther wold 33</page><page sequence="17">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 seme an od on' (BV. 13 5), "the digrees to assend to a temple must ever be od", "the(y) (i.e. the degrees or steps) must not be more then tenn fingers heygh nor les then nyne in heygh", "the Breadth (of temple steps) must be a foot and a half att least and not more then 2 foot", "The same members that ye Pedestale hath the Pogio must also have" (all BV. 36). The most interesting of these notes is at the start of the chapter (BV. I34), where Vitruvius is discussing how to construct strong foundations for temples. In foundations which project above ground level he recommends the construction of 'muretti' under the columns: "the little wales under ye Cullomes must be one and a half as brode as the Pillers in maner of Pedistale". Between them, says Vitruvius, the spaces should be vaulted over, whereatJones wrote: "but ye spaces betwixt must be volted Se Paladio. Li 4 fo 93". This is a reference to Palladio's plate of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli, a temple which is set on above-ground foundations as described by Vitruvius: Palladio's cross-section provides an exact illustration of the Vitruvian text. Meanwhile he began to make notes on Palladio Book IV. They start in the margin of chapter iii, which is devoted to the familiar topic of temple types or 'aspects'. He filled the entire margin of the chapter with his translation (P. IV. 7-8). Much overlapped with the notes he had previously made on Vitruvius; but Palladio provided some further clarification, as for example, "in antis hath too Pillasters in ye Corners and turne likewise on ye sids ofye Temp[le] and betwene thes Pilasters in front to Pillars thatt salli out and sustayne ye frontispice" (P. IV. 7), and "Amphiprostilos hath ye same maner of pillors behind as before" (P.IV.7). The fact that he noted both these points correctly here, whereas he had misunderstood them when reading Vitruvius, shows in which order he studied the two authors. Similarly, with the aid of Palladio's text he could write down much fuller and more precise descriptions of the dipteral, pseudodipteral and hypethral temples (P.IV.8) than he had managed previously. Palladio mentions with approval extant examples of the pseudodipteral temple, asJones remarked: "noat ye Temple of nimis and ye Church of S Ma Egitica have no porticos aboute but half Pillors in the sids to accompany ye Portico and thes make ye Cell larger and Take nothing away of ye aspectte". This bland and slavish translation suggests that he had not yet examined the plates in Book IV, which include illustrations of both these buildings, better known as the Maison Carree, Nimes, and the Temple of Fortuna Virilis in Rome. He probably read no further on that occasion. A considerable number of notes scattered through the pages of Book IV show that he soon did examine it in some detail. In particular he read the beginning of chapter iv (P. IV.8) and translated the comments on the function and representational value of temple colonnades: "ye ancientes yoused Porticoes for Commoditie of ye people and to walke withoute ye Cell wheare ye Sacrifises wer maade and to give magistie to temple(s)". Here he found once more a list of five types of intercolumniation. Transferring this to the margin - "Picnostilos Sistilos Eustilos Diastilos Ariostilos" - he turned on and began to study the "aspect" and intercolumniation of some of the temples featured by Palladio. These are characteristics which are invariably mentioned in the text, but he made his notes alongside the illustrations. The Temple of Mars Ultor (P.IV. i6), therefore, was "winged about" (he preferred the Palladian translation of Vitruvius's "peripteral"), its "manner" Picnostilos. The Temple ofJove being Corin- thian was of course also "Picnostilos" (P.IV.43), whereas its aspect was "the falce 34</page><page sequence="18">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION winged caled by Vitruvio Psudodipteros". When he reached the Ionic Temple of Fortuna Virilis (P.IV.48) he forgot what he had already read in chapter iii and jotted down the first word he saw, "Prostilos", ignoring Palladio's reference to the half columns on the flank of the building. Instead, his mind leapt back to Vitruvius and he noted down a cross-reference to Barbaro's diagram of the prostyle temple on BV. I I9. Against the plan he repeated this error: "The aspect face in pllors". (Long afterwards he realized his mistake and on P.IV.48 squeezed the words "or rather sudoperipteros Vitr. Li. 4 fo.220"). Against the elevation of the temple facade (P.IV.5o) he noted "The maner sistilos" but, ignoring Palladio's observation that in this temple the intercolum- niation is two and one quarter diameters, again repeated the Vitruvian text "of 2 diameters for spaces se Vitru. li 3 fo 124". His note against the description (P.IV. 55) of the Temple of Mars shows the same recourse to Vitruvius; where Palladio's text reads 'I1 suo aspetto e lo alato a torno', he wrote: "Peripteros winged aboutte se Vitruvios Li 3 fo I20". Similarly, against the plan of the Temple ofJupiter Tonans (P. IV.7 ) he wrote: "The aspecte of This temple is Dipteros that is Dubble winged Se Vitruvi Li 3 fo I20". At this stage he made only two further observations of this sort. Against the plan of the Temple ofJupiter Stator, the Tre Colonne in the Forum, which Palladio reconstructed as a regular peripteral temple (P.IV.68), he wrote: "The aspecte peripteros winged aboutte". And he noted the intercolumniation of the circular Temple of Vesta at Tivoli: "spases of 2 Diamiters of the Pillor" (P. IV.92), a piece of information given in the text two pages further back. He made a few antiquarian notes about the temples illustrated. He was particularly impressed by the Temple of Mars Ultor and its setting in the centre of an elaborately shaped precinct wall, in which were niches for statues and other trophies of war- even "Too tables of appelles doing hong heare" (P.IV. I5). He also annotated the plan (P. IV. 16) with a translation of Palladio's comments on the way in which the precinct is made internally symmetrical in spite of irregularly sited structures behind. On the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli he made two notes (P.IV.93). He had already cross-referred to this page when reading Vitruvius's remarks on vaulted temple basements (see above p. 34) and now he wrote: "This Pavefment is Raysed from the ground ye third part of the length of ye Pillor and arched from Pillor to Pillor Se Vitruvio Li 3 fo I34". His other note on this page draws attention to a practical refinement of handling mentioned in Palladio's commentary: "thes Basis have no Plinth under them yt the Space to walk under ye Portico might be larger". Controversies over the supposed functions of some of these buildings intrigued him. On the Temple of Fortuna Virilis (P.IV.48) he noted opposing views with misleading brevity: "the temple of fortune ever maad Rownd" (merely the view of one party and not that accepted by Palladio), and translated Palladio's valid argument: "This can not be a bassilica because yt is but littell and besids ther is no portico in the inner side". On the Maison Carree at Nimes his note (P.IV. III) is completely explicit: "Palladio Thinkes this a tempell by ye heygh forme of yt and not a Bassilica as somm have thought". Some of the earliest notes in Book IV demonstrate that he was already interested in the details of the orders used in antique buildings and the extent to which they corresponded with the model orders which he had recently examined in Book I. At this 35</page><page sequence="19">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 stage the observations he wrote down were never his own, but merely translated Palladio's text. Departures from strict translation normally indicate a practical end in view. The form of the Ionic capitals of the Temple of Fortuna Virilis differs from that given in Book I in that the volutes are not round but oval, and those at the angles have 'fronte da due parti', that is, two faces sharing a diagonal volute, a form which Palladio liked and, so he tells us, used in many of his buildings. Beside the large-scale detail of the angle captial which he accordingly illustrates (P. IV. 5 I)Jones wrote "in this plant of the capitell S you may know how to make them". As for the bases of Ionic columns, Palladio comments on the peculiar fact that only the Attic base, and not the base assigned to the order by Vitruvius, occurs in antique Ionic temples (as far as was known in the sixteenth century); but Jones's translation: "the ansientes did never yous the Ionicke bace in any of ther Buildinges" (P.IV.48), went beyond the more circumspect 'non si trova in alcuno edificio'. Turning to an example of the Corinthian order he studied the plate illustrating the capital of the Temple of Mars Ultor (P.IV.2I). The corresponding text (P.IV. 15) draws attention to the disproportionate height of the abacus and to the olive leaves on the capital itself, the lower ones bulging, 'il che da loro grandissima gloria'.19 He noted both points (P.IV.2I): "This capitall hath a greater abacco then is accostomed" and "the leaves ar olive and ye under leaves swell at the Bottom a thinge to be Immitated'. The final phrase, used here for the first but by no means the last time, reveals the practical purpose of his studies. He did not at this point annotate systematically any of the temples illustrated in Palladio's fourth book. He did however in this earliest phase of his reading treat Serlio's account of the Pantheon (Sq. 50 r and v) to a full set of underlinings and marginal translations, not even ignoring such byways of the text as "Titianes work hath force and sweetnes". Perhaps the verve and enthusiasm in Serlio's account of this building attracted him more strongly than Palladio's succinct rehearsal of facts. To quote only Jones's translations of the aesthetic comments in Serlio's account gives some idea of its character: "Pantheon the fayrest &amp; Best understood amoungst ye antiquitis", "the members answear to ye boddye", "the rownd the perfaytest forme", "on only lyght and that aboufe wch dilateth yt self every whear", "windowes over ye Chapels wch gives them a scecond light taken from ye lyght aboufe', "by reason of ye heygh light not only ye statues but the people tha(t) com into ye ar in it sheays better", "the architecte Juditious and Reserved in Campaning ye members wth ye hole and nott confonding wth to much Carving. Reserved In observing the Corinthian order th(r)owout". In making the investigation which this series of entries records Jones learned two valuable lessons which were to have an important bearing on his subsequent architect- ural design. He became aware of the richness and diversity of antique architecture, and his attention was directed to details, sometimes minute details, the subtle importance of which in imparting character to an entire building he came to appreciate more and more. We have seen how in this early period he studied the Pantheon in the pages of Serlio. On the ten pages which Palladio devoted to this crucial building he made at this stage but a single note. Nevertheless, brief though this is, it gives a remarkable indication of the alertness to architectural detailing which his studies were beginning to develop. In 36</page><page sequence="20">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION the margin of the plate which illustrates the part-elevation of the interior (P. IV. 82) he translated Palladio's comment on P.IV. 74 on the way the cornice above the main niche was extended in simplified form across the wall to the left and right until it met the shafts of the giant pilasters on either side: "*great Judgment of ye architete seing the Pilasters of the Chappels comm so farr out of the wall as to bee Capable of the hoole sayle of the Cornish of ye tabernackle made only a streyt Gullet and Turned the rest of ye Cornish into a fascia or Border playne". In his quarto edition of Serlio he made one other early note, and this too relates to the deft handling of a minor detail, but by a modern architect. It concerns the way Bramante in the Belvedere Logge carries his cornice across unbroken over the blind arcade while breaking back the frieze and architrave over each arch and breaking them forward again over each flanking pilaster. Serlio in the text which accompanies the enlarged detail of this feature (Sq. I I8r) praises Bramante's skill: 'Ma in questa cornice l'Architettor hebbe bel giudicio nel far correre il gocciolatoio intero, &amp; far risaltare gli altri membri da quello in giu, laqual cosa torna tutta gratiosa, &amp; il gocciolatoio viene ad essere picu forte, &amp; conserva tutta l'opera dalle acque'.20 Having underlined part of the text, as indicated here, he made a condensed marginal translation; "goodJudgment of Bramante to to (sic) let ye Corrona ronn hoole and maad retorne all ye other members". Serlio's concluding comment, 'anzi sono incomportabili i risalti, dove la colonna non ha due meze colonne dalle bande', he also translated, with an inadvertent reversal of meaning: "retornes ar insupportable unles wheare ye Pillor hath not too half Pillors on ye sides". Such notes, rare though they may be before about I6Io, show thatJones was making himself into a connoisseur of architectural detail. The connection of thought which he must have made in pursuing these subtleties is well brought out in the two notes which he wrote beside the passage in Vitruvius's third book, chapter three, which discusses and justifies the diminution under the necking of a column shaft (BV. 133): "a rule for the diminishing of Pillors under the Capitelle" and "the eye followes gratousnes and baytye". Above his second note here he wrote much later "Eurythmia", the word which he came to accept as the primary technical term for architectural beauty. Several other notes scattered through his Vitruvius suggest his consciousness, now that he had studied Book I and Barbaro's commentary on it, of what it meant to be an architect. He read the passage in Book VI chapter ii in which Vitruvius states that the choice of proportions in relation to siting and other accidental factors is dictated not only by rules but also by the architect's visual sensitivity: "So ye Increasing and diminishing to ye ne(ce)ssety of ye Place that nothing may be desired more for Eurithmia". He continued with a significant mistranslation of Vitruvius's 'Et questo non solo per dottrina, ma per acutezza d'ingegno si puo fare': "no rule to teach this but by sharpenes ofwitt first know the ordering mesures and from them take ye alteringe of anythinge". Finally it was at this time that the poignant introduction to the second book caught his eye, the story of the architect Dinocrates, "bige of stature and gratous of Aspecte", who recommended himself to Alexander by his looks and bearing rather than his grandiose architectural project. Dinocrates was, he noted (BV.66), "subtil in his invention". However he also noted the "Juditious answer ofAllexander"; and at the foot of the page he translated Vitruvius's account of his own very different self-image and ambitions: "Vitruvious littel of stature deformed by adge and and (sic) wrake by 37</page><page sequence="21">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: I992 infermitie. hops to com to honoure by wryghtinge". One can hardly doubt with which of these two he identified himself. Among the modern architects whose lives had been written by Vasari he showed interest at this early stage in one in particular, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. This may possibly have been because he already owned Labacco's engraving of Sangallo's model for St Peter's, for this was one of his sources in making the design for the steeple of Old St Paul's Cathedral in I608. He made translations throughout the vita (VV. 313- 21). They amount largely to a list of Sangallo's buildings, concluding (VV.320) with: "A wonderfull Model maad for St Peters by ye Order of Sangallo and doon by Antonio Abacco". He indicated "The Opinion of MiAngell and many other workemen on ye modell of San Gallo", but it being adverse he did not repeat it. He noted that Sangallo "helptt Bramante In his dessines" and that he made "many dessines" for the Palazzo Farnese (VV.3I3), but the only descriptive passage which he translated refers to the marble-lined chapel in the church of San Jacopo degli Spagnuoli in Rome, with its "volte of marble wth An exelent Partiment of Otangles" (VV.3 14). The two churches built by him on the Viscentina island in Lake Bolsena, one "square wthout and Rownd wthin", the other "square wthoutt &amp; ottangle wthin" "sheawde how he could vari ye termes of Architecture" (VV. 3 6). He was also impressed by the structural skills which Sangallo exhibited on various occasions: "Sgallo Exelent In Joyning waales surely" (VV.3I7). At the Belvedere Logge "Rafell urbine to Pleasure sum Left many Spaces in ye walle of ye Logie Papalle &amp; yt was Reddi to Ruine antonio Helpt yt" (VV.3 15); when in 1526 the foundations of the church of the Madonna threatened to fail "Antonio Proped ye arches and strenthened ye foundation" and "thicning ye walles and Pillasters without and within gave yt a good forme both in ye hole and Partes" (VV. 317); whenJacopo Sansovino got into difficulties in establishing the foundations of the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini in the bed of the River Tiber, Sangallo made "a rare modell" which indicated how to solve the problem (VV. 315); though, as Vasari pointed out, it was an "error of ye florentines in Casting so much mony in a foundation". He also translated the aphorism with which Vasari concluded this story: "an Architecte shuld thinke well before he begine ye worke" (VV.3 6). And there were other general remarks worth translating: "Rich Prin(c)es shuld leave behynd them a fame by building Richly", "nothing Left of ye Romans but Ruines" (VV.313), "Reordering or Restoring thinges begon by an other ever is hard &amp; Difficult" (VV. 3 8). When we come to examine Jones's notes datable to the second phase, c. i6Io-I2, it will be best to look first at his continuing studies of the buildings and building methods of Antiquity. Returning to Palladio's first book he resumed annotation at chapter ix, where six types of ancient walling are described and illustrated (P.I. I 1-13). He made a point of noting the temples and city walls where examples of the various kinds of wall construction could be seen. At the end of the chapter he also translated Palladio's cross-reference (P.I. 13) to Book IV: "In ye Booke of antiquities you shall find thes maner of waales In divers Places", despite the fact that you will look for many of them there in vain. The techniques described in constructing these different types of wall seem to have interested him less, for he gave up translating half-way through. Presumably he did not consider them of any practical use. He must have read through 38</page><page sequence="22">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION the two following chapters at this stage, for he translated the last sentence of chapter xi (P.I. 14): "Thus much for Playne Waales now for Ornamentes ofwich ye Collumbs ar ye Chefest". Only on some later occasion did he underline in pencil the most significant points in chapter x, which deal with the ancients' techniques of laying masonry and carving and polishing decorative details. Columns, of course, he had already thoroughly analysed. Nevertheless, authors other than Vitruvius and Palladio do discuss the Orders, and one might expectJones to have been interested in what they had to say. But at this stage only one such passage tempted him to annotation, Serlio's account of the Doric order (Book IV chapter vi), where arguments are rehearsed which he had already encoun- tered in Vitruvius. What caught his interest now was Serlio's discussion of the appropriate circumstances in which to use the order (Sf.IV. 17): "the Ansients dedicated This Dorricke Order T[o the] most Roboustious good[s] (i.e. gods)", "Cristians too Saintes o[f] the like nature", "Also to Soldierly an[d] Robustious parsones of what Condittion soever", all which led to the conclusion: "and varry ye worke i[n] Dillicasie or strength [acco]rding to ye personn". Serlio continues by alluding to the problem that the Doric order appears to lack a base, andJones continued his translation: "Sum hold an opinion That Vitruvious spake of ye Co[ri]nthian bacce and not the Dorricke and That ye Do[rricke] Collome hath no Baace all(?)ng thes antiquities", "The Corinthian bace In th[e] Antiquities being other wise (?) maade Serlio Taakes The Atticke baace for ye Dorr[ick] and this baace Bramanti The Renuer of ye good archi[tect]ure In Ittali used in his workes". His pen did not hesitate as he copied down for the second time the proportions of the Attic base, even though what Serlio recommends is almost identical to what he had already translated from Palladio. At the end of his account of the Attic base Serlio introduces the fundamentally important concept which Jones had already encountered in Vitruvius's discussion of the Ionic architrave (see p. 3I above), that proportional relationships may be altered to take account of the position of a building and its parts in relation to the eye of the observer. Thus he translated: "And yfye Baace bee under [the] eye ye fillite under ye upp[er] boultell must bee sumwhatt Bigger then ye Other becaus[e] ye Boultel shaddowes yt. B[ut] if yt bee aboufe our eye y[e] fillitt aboufe ye undermost Boultell and hidden by yt [must] be bigger then ye other And ye Casementt being hidden by ye Boultell in th[at] Case you maye make yt b[igger] then ye mesure given". Serlio's general conclusion, that the architect must pay careful attention to these 'accidents', since - as Vitruvius assumes - the architect will understand their operation through his familiarity with mathematics, he summed up with extreme but suggestive concision: "By This example Lett ye Architecte bee able to supplie ye defectes of ye artt with mathimatical Resones". Many of Palladio's descriptions of antique temples contain detailed comments on the minutiae of capital and entablature design. Here his text glows with rare enthusiasm, and sometimes he mentions that he has imitated the features depicted or invites others to imitate them. We have seen how Jones picked up this type of comment in his notes on the Temple of Mars Ultor. A little later he searched through the pages of Book IV looking for such comments and annotated over half of them. The translations in this group can be recognized by the thin pen lines and the pronounced slope of the handwriting. On the plates he generally indicated the detail in question by means of a 39</page><page sequence="23">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 pointing hand in the margin. Presumably he worked through the pages of the book from front to back, but it will be more enlightening to examine them here in groups, relating to the design respectively of bases, entablatures and capitals. On the design of base mouldings he found four comments worth translating. At the Temple of Peace (Basilica of Maxentius) Palladio discusses the proportions of the base itself, as Jones noted (P.IV. 14): "this bace was heygher then half ye Diamiter of ye Pillor and ye Plinth thiker then ye 3 part of his heyght, to beare ye wayght the better". At the Temple of Nerva the point at issue is the divergence of the form of the Attic base from both Vitruvius's account and the model form presented by Palladio in Book I: "B is ye Bace differing from Vittru: and Palladio by ye littell boultell under ye Casement" (P.IV.28). At the Temple of Mars Palladio draws attention (P.IV.55) to the small additional roll ('bastoncino') between the flared foot of the column shaft and the top of the Attic base. To compensate for this the flare ('cimbia') is made unusually small, 'e cosi riesce molto gratiosa'. This he rendered (P. IV. 60): "noote the smale Boultel under the simbia wch being littel is very gratious". The much more conspicuous addition above the column bases of the Baptistery of Constantine Palladio confesses that he has imitated in special circumstances (P.IV.6I): "Palladio maad yous of this invention of rasing the basse heaygher by leaves when the Pillers wear to shortte and wear of exellent marble, In the Porch of Saint Gorgies in Vennise". A point worth making about this series of notes is that he consistently translated the Italian technical terms 'ovolo' and 'cavetto' by their English equivalents in craft terminology, 'boultel' and 'casement', which may lend credence to the tradition (alluded to above) that he received training in his youth as a joiner. Concerning pediments and entablatures there was more for him to get his teeth into. He noted the canonic proportions of the pediment of the Maison Carree (P. IV.I 13), translating: "this frontispice is maade as Vitruvious teacheth for of nine part(s) of ye length of ye Cornish ye frontispice (changed to 'timpano' much later) is on in heygt under ye cornish", ignoring the fact that the plate does not show these proportions. The temple at Assisi exhibits, as Palladio observes (P.IV. I03), unusual handling of the sloping cornice of the pediment, where upright leaves on a bold wave moulding take the place of the modillions in the horizontal cornice, though in all other mouldings the two cornices correspond. Jones's note on the relevant page (P.IV.Io6) employs a technical term not in the text: "the Cornich of the frontispice varied from ye other and hath a greate gola Dritta Rostrata under ye Corrona Cutt wth leaves". Modillions on the Temple ofJove called forth Palladio's comment (P.IV.4I), both the vertical ones in the sloping cornices of the pediment and those in the horizontal cornice centred on the columns below. Jones drew pointing hands on both the relevant plates and translated: "The modillioni of the frontispice go right downe wch oft ever to be observed" (P.IV.44) and "the midelmost of thes modillioni stands evne wth the rose of the Capitell. and the .. ." (final words obliterated by his later correction) (P.IV.47). The comment on the richly carved cima of the architrave here he translated twice, on the plate (P.IV.47): "an exelent invension of a Cimato", and against the text (P.IV.41), which he then read on, making three more marginal notes as he went and concluding with the closing judgement: "This Temple Palladio thinkes to be the greatest and most adorned of all that wear in Room". 40</page><page sequence="24">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION The unusual adornment of mouldings in one part of the entablature or another regularly provokes a comment from Palladio. For example at the Temple of Peace the crowning moulding of the architrave divided into two and enriched with contrasting patterns of carving, he praised as 'degno di avertimento per esser diverso da gli altri, e fatto molto gratiosamente' (P. IV. I ), ajudgement whichJones compressed into: "The Cimati of the Architrave is exterordinari and gratious" (P.IV. I4). At the Temple of Jupiter Tonans the ovolo between frieze and cornice is different from any he had ever seen, an example of variety of form showing much judgement (P.IV.70). Jones indicated the moulding on the plate (P. IV. 72) and paraphrased Palladio's words: "The undermost ovolo over the freese beinge Carved of a strange worke is Rare, being too severall Ovoloes in this Cornish to varry on forom the other, to bee Immitatedd". Conversely, from the over-rich cornice of the Baptistery of Constantine, regarded by Palladio as a modern work constructed from antique fragments, he drew the valuable observation: "In Cornisches yt is sildom seen amongst the ansients that too members of on sort on aboufe the other. wthout somme other member betwix besides the fillette' (P.IV.6I). Turning to the large-scale illustrations of Corinthian capitals, he found three which by their canonical form or imaginative enrichment were particularly attractive. The capital used at the Maison Carree has an enriched abacus with a central flower of a characteristic type: "ye flore in ye midest covers ye Abaco and ye Orlo of ye Bare Capitell. as in all ye anticke Capitels of this sort" (P.IV. I 15). The other two are of a more exotic character. That of the Temple of Jupiter Stator has a curious detail of foliage curling up from the bell to spread across the abacus. Alongside Palladio's comment on this 'bella inventione' (P.IV.67) Jones wrote: "noote the florishing wch Comes out of the stalks of the vollut and Roones over the Abaco of the Capitel", and against the illustration (P.IV.69) he pointed a hand, adding appreciatively: "an exelent Invention of carving in ye Abacco". Most thought-provoking of all was the capital of the Temple of Castor and Pollux at Naples, described in detail by Palladio (P.IV.95), who concludes with the important precept: 'Onde cosi da questo, come da molti altri esempi sparsi per questo libro si conosce che non e vietato all' Architetto partirsi alcuna volta dall' uso commune, pur che tal variatione sia gratiosa, &amp; habbia del naturale'. He registered the concession and his translation captured it well: "noot the clothing of the Caulicoli wth leaves whos branch beares up the rosse a dilicat invention and sheaues thatt wch is don by reason and is gratious Though yt vary from the useua[ll] way is good and to be folloed" (P.IV.97). Late in this period he made a considerable number of further notes in this book, suggesting some sort of structured study of the temples illustrated. Particularly elaborate are his notes on the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, and they illustrate well the range of his interests. On the text page he translated the generalization about the handling of the podium of an antique temple: "an Observation/ That ye Ansientes maade allways ye Bacce of ye Bacementes and Pedistalles thiker by half and moore then the Cimatio ye reason is the neear ye ground ye fermer" (P.IV.30), and beside the relevant plate (P.IV.32) he translated the next sentence which draws attention to the way in which the basement is brought forward to enclose the entrance steps with statues set on the front ends. Elsewhere on the plates he translated the items in the key 4I</page><page sequence="25">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 which indicate the form of the columned and arcaded forecourt and its relation to the temple, as well as the 'aspect' and 'manner' of the temple itself. On P. IV. 3 3 is indicated the original site of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, described in the text as 'la statua . . . di Antonio . . . laquale hora e nella piazza del Campidoglio'. Two amendments inJones's translation of this passage: "A was ye horsse In Brase wth Marc. Aulelio (sic) wch is now In ye Cappitolle', indicate that he already had some familiarity with Roman topography at this date. Onto the page with details of the order of this temple (P.IV. 3 5) he transferred the lettered key with the addition of some relevant comments from the text; for example, on the cornice: "ye Dentels ar not Carved and ther ar no Carthuses(.) beetweene ye Dentell and ye Corrona this greatt Ovolo", and on the frieze: "griffons facce to facce houlding such Anticke kndelstikes as ye yoused In sacrifice". Below this, remembering a sarcophagus panel he had seen in I609 in Les Alyscamps at Arles,21 he wrote (in a virtually identical hand but conspicuously different gingery ink): "of This kynd of freece I sawe att Arles in Province". Moving on towards the end of the book he lettered a number of plates with identifications of parts, of the temple at Pola (P.IV. Io8, I09), the Temple of Diana at Nimes (P.IV. 122, 123), the Temple of Concord (P.. IV. 27) and the Temple of Neptune (P. IV. 129-3 3). Among these he made an interesting independent observation, drawn again from the memory of his visit to Provence. It pointed out Palladio's mistake in illustrating the front elevation of the Maison Carree with foliage decoration in the frieze: "thes freece G is not Carved in ye Tempell yt selfe in frontt for ther the inscription was of summ mettall I take yt for ye holes of ye fastning are seene" (P.IV. II3). At this time also he studied the texts and illustrations relating to three of the great vaulted structures in Rome. The Temple of Peace (Basilica of Maxentius) was, as Palladio stated; "begon by Claudious: and ended by Vespasian", and he went on to note Palladio's judgement: "This Tempell ye greatest and most magnifficent of the Cittye" (P.IV. I). Against the plan (P.IV.12) he noted down the details given in the text relating to the mighty internal columns: "There wear 8 Pillors of Marble within of Corrinthian order: in diameter 5 foo 4 yn and 53 foo heygh wt baace and Cappitell:" and translated the text describing the entrance portico, which he did not at this stage realize was a conjectural reconstruction by Palladio. The magnificent vaults of this building are barely mentioned in the text, but against the detail of the vault coffering (P.IV. 14) he wrote in an identification: "D Compartiment of stucco in ye voltes and proiecture of ye mouldinges". Both author and annotator were more interested in the detailing of the internal order. Opposite the detail of the cornice soffit Jones placed his translation: "The squares of the Roses wch ar bettwene ye Cartoses ar square and ofte to bee so:". The "Cartoses" or modillions Palladio mentions without comment, butJones had his own to make: "Thees Cartouses ar in sted of the Corrona / I thinke that ye members myght bee the greater and loose none of ye Aspecte of ye Cornish being farr from ye eye", thus taking situation into account in the way in which Vitruvius and Serlio had taught him to do. Finally he completed the translation that he had begun earlier on the proportions of the column bases: "the saille of ye Baace the saille ofyt is ye 6 part of ye Diamiter of ye Collombe". 42</page><page sequence="26">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION On the vaulted double temple of the Sun and Moon he noted the name of the builder: "Thes 2 Temple of ye Sonn and moone dedicated &amp; bulte by T Tatio kyng of the Romanes" (P.IV.36); he translated Palladio's admission that the portico and internal ornaments were conjectural: "Thes lodgs before and ornamentes wthin ar added by Palladio as he immagened the had bynn" (P. IV.3 7), and he keyed the cross-section and vault details (P.IV.38). As for the Temple of Minerva Medica, called by Palladio Le Galluce, he translated the salient points in the text (P.IV.39): "the greatest Round building next ye Pantheon/sum thinke This to bee a Basillica/That opinion false/This was a Templle". Beside the plan and cross-section (P.IV.40) he wrote further abbrevi- ated translations: "Thos who ordered the Chaples for the emperor and ye kynge of france in Saynt Peetrs tooke Pateren by this", "wch havinge in every parte membrs in place of butterresses is verry stronge", "This buildinge all of Bricke and had Binn Covered wth marble", "Thes to Cels on ye sides hadd byn Richly adorned wth neeces as may y(e)t appeare". Palladio, whose book of antiquities concentrated on temples, real or supposed, inevitably gave a limited and partial idea of ancient architecture. To counteract this Jones turned to his quarto copy of Serlio, where he found illustrations of theatres, amphitheatres and triumphal arches. The notes which he made on them at this period, even though they constitute the majority of the annotations in this book, have a certain random air. Nevertheless they are of interest as his first jottings on two types of building to which he would later give considerable thought. The Theatre of Marcellus he studied with some care. On the plan (Sq.7or) he inscribed the Italian names assigned by Serlio to each part and lettered by him. In the text (Sq.69v) he noted only one of Serlio's basic points about the building: "Augustus maade yt in Marcelus name". But the text led on to three thought-provoking themes. The first of these was the degree of accuracy of the published reconstruction of the theatre. Serlio mentions Baldassare Peruzzi's excavations and the evidence relating to the plan and to the forms of the cornices which they had yielded. In response Jones wrote, "Baltazar of Sienna found outt ye Plant of this theater". Against Serlio's comment that the elevation of the theatre consisted of two orders, Doric and Ionic, he noted some evidence for a contrary view: "In ye desine of Pirro Ligorrio yt hath 3 orders dorricke Ionicke &amp; Corrinthian'. This note is of particular interest for two reasons. In its small way his indication of the conflict between the reconstructions by Serlio and Ligorio marks a further stage in the development of his critical indepen- dence. It also suggests that he may already have owned a drawing by Ligorio before his second visit to Italy, possibly part of the 'pocket-book' by Ligorio which, according to Sir Christopher Wren, had been in his possession.22 The second point in this passage which interested him was Serlio's condemnation of the licentious form of the Doric cornice 'molto lontano dalla dottrina di Vitruvio'. He noted: "ye Cornish discommended for Licensious members and being to heygh", and Serlio's definition of to err - 'fare contra i precetti di Vitruvio' - he underlined and annotated with the words: 'Praise of vittruvious'. Finally where Serlio alluded to the relationship between Greek and Roman architecture he condensed his remarks into two pithy notes: "ye Latines Learnt of ye greekes to build &amp; overronning ye greekes the Latines grew Licentious / ye greekes buildings Beter then the Romaines". 43</page><page sequence="27">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 On the theatre at Pola he made two notes (Sq. 70v). One translated Serlio's praise for the way the raked seating was built into the hillside: "the Ingienious Architecte did help himself wth ye hill for part of ye digres". The other noted the handling of the angle piers to which Serlio drew attention: "square pillors &amp; halfe Round Bounde to gether". The account of the Colosseum (Sq. 78v) was primarily of interest to him for the passage on the upward tapering of thick walls. He translated both the generalization, "diminishing upwards of ye thiknes of ye walles adds strength to a building and makes ye walle in a Pirramidalle figure", and the comment on modern practice, "this diminishing not yoused in Vennise but in ye inner part ofwaales to gayne Space and ye Joisses keepe yt in not being volted". His notes on triumphal arches were barely more coherent, as he followed Serlio's discursive text. Barbaro had introduced him to triumphal arches, for about this time he translated the gist of his remarks on the layout of a forum (BV.207): "Portigoes Sheawes a greatnes", and then "In ye hed of a Strete to see an arke trionfall Is delightfull and noble", "ye arke of Septimus Severus ye fayrest", concluding with Barbaro's Old Testament example, "Saule after a victorie Raysed an arke trioumfale' (a reference to I Samuel xv I2). On turning back to Serlio he pursued his comments on the licentious detailing of the cornices on Roman arches, a topic which, as we have seen, particularly intrigued him. He began (Sq.99v) with "architectur in ye arches at Rome do differ from ye Rulle of Vittruvious"; indicated without translating the explanation given by Serlio for this phenomenon, that the arches were constructed out of elements pillaged from other structures; and translated the criticism of the handling of the cornice of the Arch of Titus: "yt is t(oo) heygh for ye Architrav and hath to manye members"; concluding with the summary, "Serlio sheaues ye errors of this Cornish". The restorer of the Pantheon, by contrast, is praised by Serlio, because the ornaments are not confused: "Architecte that restored ye Pantheon commended". He concluded the page with a note that by now we recognize as typical: "ye Best Part of an Architect is not to be deseved In Judgmentt". His notes on the detail illustration of the Arch of Titus (Sq. Ioor) clarify what Serlio found objectionable, a feature he had already noted in the Baptistery of Constantine (see above p. 40): "The impost of he Arch ha[th] rich membes and too many for ye Confound on ye other, yfon member wear Playne &amp; another Cutt yt wear better". The other building in this group which activated his pen was the so-called Temple ofJanus, the Arcus Quadrifrons. He noted Serlio's conclusion as to its function ('un ridotto di mercanti'), (Sq.97v): "This not an Arche as is supposed but [?] for marchantes". Beside the perspective of this building (Sq.98r) he noted Serlio's praise for the practicality of the curtailed cornice moulding low down: "good judgment of ye Architect to make only ye corners in cornish ye rest in fassia nott to hinder ye walkes". And against the large-scale details of the two upper cornices (Sq.98v) he noted that Serlio had used a sighting machine to record features far from the eye: "The Traguardo yoused by Serlio to Drawe thes Too cornishes A B for standind heygtht he could not Comm To measure them as he did ye Rest". The plates and discussion devoted to buildings by Bramante and other modern masters with which Serlio concludes his third book had, as we have seen, already drawn a sophisticated reaction (see above p. 37). Now Jones made one further note 44</page><page sequence="28">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION on these pages. Examining the detail of the loggia entablature and vault springing at the Villa Madama (Sq. I2zr) he was reminded of an engraving of one of Raphaels' Vatican tapestries: "Se In ye Printt of Paule Befor Sergious of Ra ye example of this moor Playne". Presumably he had noticed that on the facing page 'the divine Raphael of Urbino' is named as architect of the villa; but in any case the comparison demonstrates his visual memory and gives an early indication of the wealth of engraved material familiar to him and on which as a masque designer he drew so extensively throughout his career.23 During this period he returned once more to the study of modern architecture. He closely examined three of Palladio's own buildings illustrated in Book II of the Quattro Libri, translating in the margins of the plates the salient points of Palladio's commen- tary. It is not clear why he chose to study these three in particular, the Villa Rotonda (P.II. I9) and the twin villas, Pisani at Montagnana and Cornaro at Piombino, illustrated on facing pages, P.II. 52-53. He probably did so on two different occasions, for his notes on the Villa Rotonda are laid out quite differently from those on the other two villas. His notes on the former, distributed against the relevant parts of the plan and section/elevation, translate the text, which in this case draws attention to features readily visible in the illustration. On the latter, by contrast, a good deal of information is provided which is impossible or difficult to derive from the illustrations, and here too he let himself be guided by the text. So he translated functional and practical points: "ye stayres ar put In ye hindermost part of ye house to avoyde could and heat", "On ye on side is the Citchin and nessesari[es] ther to / on ye other side Roms for servantes" (P.II. 53). He also noted where mezzanine rooms were placed, and in particular the various manners in which rooms were ceiled. At the Villa Cornaro, for example, he noted, "ye volts ar in heygh after ye first maner of voltes Li I fo 53", the cross-reference being his own addition; and at the Villa Pisani, which had two types of ceiling not mentioned in the first book, he consulted his dictionary to discover the meaning of Palladio's technical terms: "Voltes a schiffo Taken from scife or flatt Botte / Voltes a Cadino Taken from a Round dish or bason". Such a study inevitably led him to look again at the chapter in Book I where Palladio discusses room heights. He gave to the notes which he had previously written on the various heights of rooms (P.I.53) the heading "Generall rulle", and he noted the derivation of the second diagram from Euclid's sixth book, proposition 13. In his own copy of Euclid he did not make any notes; but his ease with geometry is indicated by the sharp criticism he registered against the diagram in which Serlio purported to show how to draw a hexagon in perspective (Sq. 2ov): "A great Errore of Serlio to make the Angles and Sides of a exagon tuch ye sids of a Square wch cannot be In the Parfict therfor not in ye digradid". He concluded the chapter on room heights by translating parts of the last two sentences (P. . 54). Here Palladio explains why different methods are required to generate the heights of rooms from their ground plans: "Thes severale heightes searve for Roomes of divers heayghtes and keeps ye flower eune of a heyght". Indeed in some circumstances it may be necessary to abandon rules altogether: "other heyghts of valtes wch falle not under Rulle" - "but according to nessesitie", as he subsequently added to complete and clarify his translation. At this point he made the diagrams of vaults on this page more useful by lettering them to correlate with a 4 45</page><page sequence="29">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: 1992 marginal list of the six types: "Six maners of valtes / valt in Crosse A / a fascia D / Remenato or part of a Circle C / Round voltes G In square Roomes / Luneti E / a Conca F". Now he also translated part of the chapter which begins on the following page, dealing with the ornaments of doors. The design of door-frames, including the role of the surviving door at the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli as a canonical model, is a matter dealt with in different ways by Serlio, Palladio (Book I chapter xxvi and Book IV chapter xxiii) and Vitruvius and his commentator (BV.IV chapter vi), and he made notes on these passages on several occasions. At an early stage he noted some of Barbaro's definitions of Vitruvian technical terms (BV. 183): "antepagmentum the Jame of the doore", "Thiromata the Dore or Portalle", "Lacunarii the Spaces wth the upper..." (petering out incomplete and rephrased on a subsequent reading)), "super- cillioum is the overthrow stone for the Inscription", "Cimatiom a small waafe', all features readily identifiable on Barbaro's plate. However, when reading Palladio's chapter he ignored the cross-reference to Vitruvius's text and Barbaro's commentary, for at that moment he was preoccupied with the role of proportion in design. Palladio's promise (P.I. 55): 'dimostrero a segnare ciascun membro particularmente c'habbia gratia, &amp; il suo debito sporto', he paraphrased, "Geometrical Proportions you[sed] to make ye members of a Cornish gratious in the Saille or Proiecture". He then proceeded to translate Palladio's fundamental statement on door design, perhaps the first time that he had seriously considered the matter, "architrave freese and Cornish ar ye orna- mentes of dores and windous/The architrave goes round about the dore and is as thicke as ye Pillastrate which must not be les then ye 6 Part of ye Light of ye dore nor more then ye 5 part and from that ye freese and cornish take ther bibneses (sic)". Thereupon he turned to Book IV and examined the evidence of antique doorways. He had previously translated Palladio's praise for the bracketed cornice over the door of the Temple of Fortuna Virilis: "the ornaments of this dore ar very fine and of exelent proportion" (P.IV.49). Now he concentrated on the page devoted to the apertures in the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli (P.IV.94). The text draws attention to the tapering of the doors and windows in this temple, as advocated by Vitruvius, Book IV chapter vi, so he wrote, "The Dore and windowes are strayter (i.e. narrower) aboufthen beneath Se Vitr: Li 4 Ca 6". He also paraphrased the final sentence, which points out the unusual detailing of the window architrave: "B In thes Simacio the Gullet Reverst of ye Archittrave A hath a small Boultel under yt wch hath more sayl then ye Gollet Reverst, never seene in any other ornamentt by Palladio". It is possible to identify a final group of pre-Italian notes, many of them probably made in anticipation of his travels. Some show a distinctive development in handwrit- ing with an italic slope not used before, though there is little change in specific letter forms; while others employ a fairly pure and self-conscious italic, ushering in the notes made in Italy in 1613-14. On P.II.4, underneath the line with which Palladio indicates the length of half a Vicentine foot and six Vicentine inches he wrote very self-consciously: "This Vissentin foot is more then our Inglesh foot by 2 ynches and the ynch more then our ynch by a 6 part/ al the desins in this booke ar mesured by this foot:". On the facing page (P.II. 5), which illustrates the plan of the Villa Antonini, he wrote, in a considerably less formal 46</page><page sequence="30">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION hand, "noat that in all this booke whear ye numbe[rs] ar in a squaar ye ar reduced to Inglish feett. from ye vizentin foott as thus 35/2]", and applied the conversion to the dimension given on the adjacent plan, writing beside 32 " 37.", beside 28 "13 -81" and so on. It thereby became obvious to him that to convert Palladio's simple Vicentine dimensions into the complex English ones to which they corresponded destroyed the clarity of the proportional relationships to which Palladio wanted to draw attention; so he abandoned his experiment forthwith. On other villa plans he sometimes wrote in further dimensions to supplement those indicated by Palladio, as for instance on the plan of the Villa Thiene at Cicogna, where his additional figures reinforce the sequence of dimensions, 8, I2, I8, 36, which governs virtually all the rooms. In anticipation of visiting some ofPalladio's villas he continued the annotation he had begun on two earlier occasions, and now worked systematically through most of the plates, taking care to note as precisely as possible the location of each villa as well as entering translations of the main points of the text beside the illustrations. These notes, on P. II.47-5 I, P. II. 54-59 and P. II. 62, can be readily recognized as a series, not only by the character of the handwriting, but by their layout and the consistent use of letters to distinguish each feature. Since all the notes are translations it is unnecessary to quote them; but at the foot of the first page, which illustrates the Villa Pisani at Bagnolo (P.II.47), Jones inserted his own generalization: "A generall noote that to all the buildings folloing that ar but of on Order the staires ar so but to thos buildings of 2 orders adorned the staires ar lightsum and Commodiously Placed". As for the palazzi which are illustrated in the first half of Palladio's second book, he did not examine these systematically but did underline and translate much of the text on the Palazzo Porto (P. II. 8), lettering the plan to indicate the features described, including parts which on visiting the building in 1614 he discovered had not been executed. The villas and palazzi which Palladio publishes provide examples of the theory of domestic design which he sets out in the two introductory chapters of Book II. Jones made extensive marginal translations on the second chapter at the same time as he annotated the villa plates. In spite of inevitable abbreviations of his author's thought, his annotations here give a vivid idea of the range of considerations to which an architect must attend when engaged in domestic design (P.II.3-4): not only the principal partes, but ye menist accommodated for yous of the Best (i.e. the best rooms) / Comparason to a mans boddi/ the most butifull partes of mans boddy most exposed to sight. so in building/in the Partes underground Sellors woodhouses kicchens and all such Places of dayly youse/ of this Commes 2 commodities first the Parte aboufe is free secondly by reason of fiers underneath yt is more holsum/ Morover being rased the house hath a better grace and to look out/ Ther must be great middeling and littell roomes on by the other that theay may searve on ye Other/ The littell must be Amedzati to gett littell romes to maake studis of and Places to Putt horse harnes / The Chambers for summer must be larce (sic) and placed tourds the north And thos for winter littell and tourds ye South and West smal chambers soner ar warmed then greatt / The chambers for the Spring and faal Place tourds ye este and that the(y) look uppon gardens Studies and liberaries lykwise / The Rooms must be so Comparted as on sid must Answer to the other and so all the building have a Convenience of members that makes yt faire and gratious. Not very much later he picked up the echo of one of the comments in this chapter when on P. II.20 he found the generalization which he translated in words starkly isolated on 47</page><page sequence="31">ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY 35: I992 the page and further indicated with a pointing hand: "A house of a noble man must have Cortill logge Haales and romes great mideling and littell". Jones translated the first chapter of Book II in a noticeably looser hand, though probably not very much later. This chapter deals with the different types of accom- modation suitable for owners of different social status, loggias and large halls for great men, lesser houses for meaner gentlemen, appropriate spaces for advocates and for merchants, and in general "diccorum in makynd (sic) the Roomes Bigg or lyttell acording to ye bignes of the house' (P.II. 3), and is thus concerned with factors which come in at a later stage than the basic principles laid down in the second chapter. Italic is the hand in which Jones made an isolated note against the sentence on P.III.25: '... una citta laquale e delle maggiori, e delle piiu nobili d'Italia', "I thinke he means Vinnise". In his Vitruvius Jones made notes in a comparable hand on two antique types of building. In Book IV chapter 8 he found the description of two sorts of circular temple, "the on without sell and only with Colloms / the other winged about" (BV. 196); and against Barbaro's ensuing plan of the type without a cella (BV. 197) he translated the method recommended for proportioning the steps to the colonnade. Similarly concen- trated on steps are his notes on Vitruvius's description of the antique theatre (Book V chapter 3), for they are confined to the following: "An E(s)petiall thing to sellecte a holsum place for the Theater" (BV.223), "the Divisions on ye Degreeses whearon ye Peopl went a Boute must bee no hygher then the(y) ar broode for hinderinge the voyse/ A line beinge Drawne from the topp to the bottom of the degrees the(y) must all tuch yt." (BV.225), and 'many and spasious Entres to Com to thes degrees by staieres" (BV. 226). A characteristic of the hand in which these entries are written is the form of lower-case d, with an upright shaft rather than the flipped-back form Jones generally used throughout his career. This feature occurs again in the series of references he wrote to Palladio's original drawings for thirty-five of the plates in the Quattro Libri. Six of these drawings he indicated with the name of the Venetian ambassador, Sir Henry Wotton, though with phraseology which does not make it absolutely clear whether Wotton was the owner of the drawings: "The drawing of thes wales Sr He Woo: and slyght sciczos of altertables" (P.I. I2), "The Drawing of this Sr He: Woo/and a scitzo of the greeke house" (P.I.30), and so on. However, the fact that he names Wotton narrows down considerably the possible dates for these entries, since for only three relatively short periods before 1624 were the two men in the same place at the same time. Wotton was resident in Venice continuously from 1604 to 1624, except for two breaks in England in 1612-16 and I619-2I; so when Jones was in Italy Wotton was in England, and they could have examined Palladio drawings together only when both were in England, in 1612-13, I 615- 6 or 6 I 9-2 I. The style of handwriting fits convincingly with other entries here assigned to the last months beforeJones left for Italy in 1613, so it seems that the sight of these drawings will have been one of his freshest experiences on his departure. On the other hand, the majority of drawings are not associated with Wotton's name. Among the Palladio drawings once owned by Jones and now in the Burlington-Devonshire collection in the British Architectural Library, eleven can be identified with drawings 48</page><page sequence="32">INIGO JONES'S ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION referred to in Jones's notes, two of which are among the six associated with Wotton's name. 24 Yet there survive in the collection a further twenty-four preparatory drawings for plates in the Quattro Libri to which he does not refer in marginal notes.25 The method and timing of his accumulation of Palladio drawings remains difficult to elucidate. Yet there is independent confirmation thatJones did have access to original drawings by Palladio in England before his second Italian journey. This comes in the first dated note he made once in Italy, the detailed description of the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza dated 23 September 1613 and written on a flyleaf of his copy of the Quattro Libri. It begins "The Theater of Palladios ordering the front of the sceane of Bricke Covered with Stuco full of ornament and Stattues as in the designe I have". The 'design' to which he refers still exists in the Burlington-Devonshire collection.26 This examination ofJones's early annotations has charted his growing architectural understanding from c. 1608 to 1613. It has shown that he went to Italy well prepared to profit from a study of Italian buildings antique and modern. He had familiarized himself with Vitruvian theory, grasped the fundamental importance of proportion to architectural design, and was already gripped by Palladio's enthusiasm for the rich variety of antique details and the design principles which underlay their use. For all his inexperience as an architect, there are signs that he already had a sense of the architect's role and vocation. Nevertheless, his study of Vitruvius, Palladio and Serlio remained essentially uncritical. It required extensive first-hand experience of the buildings, and the chance to converse with Italian craftsmen and artists, above all perhaps with the elderly Scamozzi, many of whose opinions aroused his antipathy, to generate that critical independence which is essential for the creative artist. The I613-14 visit to Italy was indeed fundamental to Jones's later architectural achievements, but he could not have profited from it without the years of previous book-study which are recorded for us in the early annotations identified here.
