GonzalezEchegaray SANCTUARY FROM NORTHERN SPAIN INTRODUCTION It has long been recognized that any interpretation of pre- historic religious behavior should be based on concrete arche- ological evidence. Yet concrete evidence for Paleolithic belief systems is extremely scanty, and that which does exist is usually enigmatic-or as Eliade has expressed it, semantically opaque.' Consequently, virtually all current reconstructions of the very early stages of development of religious ideas and behavior are really more or less plausible speculations, based, in the last analysis, on what the various scholars engaged in such reconstructions believe to be the logical necessities of the growth and development of religious systems rather than on empirical data from prehistoric research. This is not, of course, to condemn the valuable work of religion's historians; after all, they must do what they can with the data available, which are extremely uneven at best. Until very recently, there were only two sorts of archeo- logical data with any real potential for the reconstruction of Paleolithic religious systems. One is Paleolithic art, known in 1 Mircea Eliade, A History of Religious Ideas (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), 1:6-7. ? 1981 by The University of Chicago. 0018-2710/81/2101-0003$01.00</page><page sequence="2">the form of small portable decorated objects, or in those large, immovable paintings, engravings, and reliefs on cave walls and ceilings called rock art. The other source of data is evidence from human interments and associated "grave goods" or mortuary offerings. Neither kind of data has proven a totally satisfactory guide to prehistoric religious beliefs and practices. The inherent drawbacks of the data themselves are most often compounded by inadequacies in techniques used for data recovery or in the reporting process, even at the simple level of description of relevant finds. There are many important documents (such as some of the "Venus" figurines from central and western Europe, and almost all of the rock art) whose exact age is unknown. In some cases, where several interesting objects have been recovered from a single undisturbed archeo- logical level of known age, we have no idea whether they were simply found scattered over a living floor or, conversely, if they were discovered in concentrations, or in special situations (such as pits or niches) or arranged in particular spatial con- figurations which might help clarify their relationships and meaning. Often, excavators of Paleolithic burials have failed to report the essential information needed to make a certain distinction between deliberate mortuary offerings, on the one hand, and stone tools or bones accidentally included in a grave when it was filled with earth collected from the debris of earlier human occupations nearby. In addition, the data have inherent ambiguities. The decora- tion on many portable objects can be explained without recourse to religious motivations. Much of it may be simple embellishment, some of it seems to be a kind of numerical notation, and some may be marks of ownership. Spatial con- straints imposed by the long, narrow form of many decorated bone objects may have required an elongation and schema- tization of figures that produces a depiction which, because it looks "unnatural," is interpreted as "supernatural." The rock art, too, presents problems. Since we cannot determine the exact age of the depictions, it is very often impossible to distinguish figures which may have formed a single, unitary "composition" from unrelated artistic accre- tions added earlier or later. One is quite free to imagine pos- sible alternatives to a religious or magical motivation for these artistic products, as Ucko and Rosenfeld2 have so clearly 2 P. Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld, Palaeolithic Cave Art (New York: McGraw- Hill Book Co., 1967). 2 El Juyo</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions indicated. In the case of such unusual figures as the Lascaux "unicorn" or the "sorcerers" from Trois-Freres or Gabillou,3 it is always possible that we are faced with aberrant depictions produced by single deviant individuals or the work of unskilled hands rather than aspects of a socially shared symbol system. The burials offer more satisfactory evidence, but they too provide somewhat less than ideal information about Paleo- lithic religious systems; much grave furniture is probably in- dicative of status differences (e.g., those based on sex, age, or ability) among the dead or of the deceased's ownership, while living, of the buried property. In such cases factors of ideology and social organization are confused. The fact of burial itself might only reflect a belief that its performance would ensure the reincarnation of the deceased in a future generation; in this case, further information would be needed before one could call the mortuary practices in question "religious." Even elaborately constructed graves might be, in specific cases, nothing more than monuments to the memory of the dead. Published descriptions of most Paleolithic burials are not suf- ficiently careful and detailed to allow readers to evaluate these possibilities, although there are of course exceptions, such as the Aurignacian burials from Cueva Morin.4 Even where the available data are complete enough to permit the judgment that specific burials are part of a past system of religious belief and behavior, the information they provide is focused only on those aspects of belief and ritual related to the crossing of the frontier between life and death: the effects this dramatic pas- sage produced on the deceased, the necessary reorganization of the community of survivors, and the newly established net- works of rights, obligations, and expectations which link the deceased to the rest of the all-embracing community of living and dead. Important as they are, these behavior patterns and the ideas they embody are clearly just one small part of the total domain of religion (although it happens to be the part of Paleolithic religion about which we are most reliably informed). For years, Paleolithic prehistorians have hoped to find satisfactory evidence for other aspects of religious behavior but have made little progress to that end. Although we have had only a general idea of what we were looking for, the durable 3 A. Leroi-Gourhan, Prehistoire de l'art occidental (Paris: Lucien Mazenod, 1965), figs. 57, 58. 4 J. Gonzalez Echegaray and L. Freeman, Vida y muerte en Cueva Morin (San- tander: Institucion Cultural de Cantabria, 1978). 3</page><page sequence="4">residues we are tracking should have certain specific character- istics which would convince the most rigorous observer that the behavior that produced them was properly "religious." For all intents and purposes, that means we are not concerned with everyday behavior which was simply consistent with the precepts of supernatural powers but, specifically, with religious ritual, culturally patterned symbolic behavior by which the human community (or agents thereof) attempt to influence culturally postulated superhuman beings.5 The arbitrary sym- bolic nature of ritual behavior should be indicated in the archeological record (at least occasionally) by the fact that it is obscure, and that it is not directly explicable in terms of its efficacy in the day-to-day problems of human survival. The communal nature of a ritual could be demonstrated by indica- tions that several individuals collaborated in its performance. The fact that religious rituals are a form of interaction between humans and supernatural beings could best be shown by the discovery, in association with vestiges of ritual behavior, of a representation of the supernatural being(s) in question. Obvi- ously such a narrow definition excludes from consideration much ordinary religious behavior, but it does have the advan- tage that behavior satisfying these conditions would be con- vincingly religious to the most skeptical observer. Now, at last, residues of behavior satisfying all these criteria have been discovered in a Paleolithic site: El Juyo in Cantabrian Spain. THE EXCAVATIONS The cave of El Juyo opens at the bottom of a karstic depres- sion some eight kilometers west of the city of Santander, capital of the Spanish northern coastal province of the same name. It is only some five kilometers south of the seacoast. After having been effectively sealed from all but the most sporadic and ephemeral human penetration for some 14,000 years, it was rediscovered in 1953 and excavated for the first time by J. Gonzalez Echegaray and Paul Janssens in 1955-56.6 6 See M. Spiro, "Religion: Problems of Definition and Explanation," in Anthro- pological Approaches to the Study of Religion, ed. M.

Gonzalez Echegaray, Memoria de las excavaciones de la cueva del Juyo (1955-56) (Santander: Patronato de las Cuevas Prehistoricas, 1958). 4 El Juyo</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions Because the site contained a long sequence (nearly 3.5 meters deep) of deposits attributed nearly in their entirety to the Paleolithic industrial phase called Magdalenian III, and pro- vided much subsistence-related material, we selected it for intensive reexcavation in 1978 and 1979. Freeman and Gonzalez Echegaray were codirectors of the new research, along with R. G. Klein (University of Chicago) and I. Barandiaran (Uni- versity of Santander). Our work was financed by the Spanish Ministry of Culture (Direcci6n General del Patrimonio Artistico y Cultural) and the (U.S.) National Science Founda- tion. During the 1978-79 campaigns, we aimed to produce a wide areal exposure (over thirty square meters) of the two uppermost Magdalenian horizons ("levels" 4 and 6) in a main gallery, formerly the vestibule of the cave (see fig. 1), whose entry was closed by a rockfall and subsequent stalagmite formation just after the last Magdalenian occupation, level 4. Charcoal from level 4 has been radiocarbon dated to 13,920 + 240 years B.P.(I-10,736). We recovered a great deal of archeo- logical material in the two seasons' fieldwork to date, and also much information on the subsistence practices of the cave dwellers, which had been our primary goal. However, equally important information about past human behavior came from the discovery of elaborate structural complexes in both level 4 and underlying level 6. The principal discovery made during these two seasons is a very peculiar set of structures and asso- ciated materials found in level 4, including the "sanctuary," which is the subject of this paper. At present, this complex is restricted to an area of some eleven square meters in the part of our excavations furthest from the sealed entrance. Only the part of the complex which constitutes the sanctuary will be discussed here. Further information is forthcoming in Spanish in the near future7 (Gonzalez Echegaray and Freeman, 1981), but our interpretation of this complex as a sanctuary can only be evaluated if we describe it here in considerable detail. During excavation, we learned that the sanctuary was con- structed in two phases. Throughout the first stage, the atten- tion of the analyst is struck by a plethora of minute construc- tional details, which seem to epitomize the "meaning" of the growing structural complex. These details, which are not 7 J. Gonzalez Echegaray and L. G. Freeman, "Le mascara del santuario de la Cueva de 'El Juyo,"' in M. Almagro, ed., Centenario de Altamira (Madrid: Ministerio de Educaci6n y Ciencia, 1981). 5</page><page sequence="6">visible at any distance, may have had as their only human audience the builders themselves, and they may all have been at least part-time ritual specialists. In the second phase, the structural elaborations produced earlier were hidden under a simpler facade, apparently designed to produce an immediate visual impact on viewers entering the vestibule from outside. THE SANCTUARY: FIRST PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION Immediately prior to the occupation of El Juyo by the people responsible for the accumulation of level 4 (see fig. 1), cold climatic conditions caused the ceiling and walls to spall and produced thick local accumulations of rock slabs and splinters on the surface of the site. The inhabitants of level 4 rearranged the fallen debris in one area to make a roughly triangular, hollow space among the blocks, and they dug into the earth below the rockfall to produce a shallow trench (St 1 in fig. 1). The hollow thus formed measures some 110 centimeters in length (east-west) by eighty centimeters in width. A piece of white coloring matter was put in the bottom of the trench, with some shells of limpets (Patella) and periwinkles (Lit- torina), and a shallow layer of clean sand was scattered over the whole trench. Then several ribs of red deer and feet of roe deer were placed in the trench, and the fact that some of the roe deer foot bones were found in the same relative posi- tions they occupy in the living animal suggests that they were deposited with tendons and flesh still adhering to them. Another layer of sand, some ten centimeters deep, was spread atop these bones and then covered with a rose-colored layer of powdered ochre, up to one centimeter deep in places. The ochre layer made a vivid color contrast with all the surrounding deposits. Near the center of the cavity, we found the tip of an antler tine some fifteen centimeters long, stuck vertically, point down, into the ochre. Then loose earth, the debris of previous occupations scraped up nearby with all the organic material and discarded artifacts such levels normally contain, was packed into the trench, filling it to the level of the top of the vertical antler. A new deposit of atrophied lateral phalanges of red deer, roe deer jaw fragments, and red ochre was placed atop the filled trench. The next building phase involved the construction of an earthen mound, made up of thick layers of earth collected from occupation layers in the cave alternating 6 El Juyo</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions with thinner horizons of burnt vegetation, animal remains, and ochre like that just described. We call the second kind of layer an "offering" layer and the first a layer of "fill." The dirt in the fill level was not simply shoveled haphazardly into a heap to build up the mound: small lots of earth were carefully placed next to each other on the mound. These lots could be seen in plan as the layers were excavated; they are perfectly circular and invariably either ten centimeters or twenty centi- meters in diameter (most are the smaller size), and approxi- EL JUYO LEVEL 4 1979 FIG. 1.-Floor plan of level 4. See text for explanation of symbols. 7</page><page sequence="8">mately ten centimeters thick. Seen in vertical section, they have straight lateral walls, showing that they were carefully everted from rigid-walled cylindrical containers like largish cups or small buckets. In fact, if one were to take a straight- walled bucket, fill it with wet sand, invert it on the ground, and then remove the bucket (as children do playing on the beach), one would have a very close analogy to our cylindrical lots of fill. What is more, the ten-centimeter-wide cylinders were scrupulously positioned in regular patterns, one in the center and six surrounding it, with their edges touching but almost never damaging each other. Thus the mound is mostly constructed of a series of rosettes, each formed by seven cylindrical lots of earth. Since the mound is not perfectly regular, spaces on its sides too small to enclose a whole rosette were partly filled by lots of earth twenty centimeters in diam- eter. The empty spaces between rosettes were packed with clean clay, and the surface of each rosette was usually plastered over with more clay, mostly red, yellow, or green in color. The clay plaster sometimes incorporates shells of limpets or winkles. In one fill layer, a central black rosette is surrounded by red "petals" separated from one another by black rays. In others, the central rosette is one color and the surrounding ones are alternately red and yellow or red, yellow, and green. This play of colors, though somewhat faded, was quite striking during our excavation, and must have been much more vivid when the clay was moist and fresh. Several layers of those rosettes alternate with at least five layers of offerings; the mound built up in this way was seventy- five centimeters deep when finished. Atop its outermost layer we found several intact bone spearpoints and large lumps of red ochre. The whole earth mound was encased in a shell made of clay, reinforced by stone slabs and fragments of long or flat animal bones; the bones used are much larger on average than the usual size of bone fragments in the mound or else- where in level 4. Between the dark earth making up the mound and the yellowish clay of its casing, we found about twenty- five whole bone spearpoints, placed flat and apparently forming a line around the upper part of the mound. Surrounding the top of the clay-slab casing, the builders stood or leaned a number of large flat stones, some more than thirty-five centimeters in major dimensions. These served to support an enormous horizontal limestone slab, 180 centi- 8 El Juyo</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions meters long, 120 centimeters wide, and fifteen centimeters thick on average (S in fig. 1). The edges had been battered to smooth them and to give the slab the shape desired. The limestone is the same as that composing the cave wall and ceilings; we do not know where it was broken away from its matrix, but it did not come from the ceiling or walls near the area excavated and therefore must have been moved a good many meters before it was carefully placed atop the mound and its casing. The slab weighed about 900 kilograms (nearly a ton), so the process must have been a difficult one that required many hands. This large and complicated structure is only one part of the sanctuary complex. A similar but smaller (seventy-five-by- fifty-centimeter) structure, also composed of a mound capping a trench, forms a right angle with the long axis of the first. Its bottom was also covered by a reddish layer of powdered ochre, but in its center, instead of a vertical antler, we dis- covered a small hollow filled with blackish earth. A large chunk of red ochre lay nearby. Over all was the first of several layers of a black, charcoal-rich, greasy earth, which stained everything it came in contact with and still had a sourish smell of organic decomposition. In one of them, a single, complete bone spearpoint was found. These layers alternated with the familiar fill horizons of carefully positioned circular lots of earth, ten centimeters in diameter, this time disposed not in rosettes but in a double line. From the northeast corner, closest to the large mound, a hole lined with black, greasy earth led down into the interior of the large structure, providing a channel of communication between the contents of the two mounds. The mouth of this tube, in the smaller mound, was ringed by a circle of small stones. A stone and clay wall com- pletely surrounded the small structure, separating it from the larger. The stones in this wall were of different sizes, and several were very nearly vertical. From the bottom of the trench to the top of the mound the small structure was sixty centimeters deep. In addition to the two major structures just described, the complex included a series of smaller, more or less circular pits (P in fig. 1). At the narrowest (southern) end of the smaller structure was a twenty-centimeters-wide pit, some thirty cen- timeters deep. Two other similar pits were found (with diam- eters, respectively, of thirty and forty centimeters)-one 9</page><page sequence="10">between the two mounds and another, oval and larger, to the east of the large structure under one end of the huge slab. The contents of all these pits are similar: each contains bits of ochre, many limpet and periwinkle shells, and, especially interesting, a substantial number of eyed bone needles, several of which were complete, in striking contrast to the rare and fragmentary specimens found elsewhere in level 4. Sometimes these needles were placed vertically in the pits. The pits were covered by the clay casing over the mounds. Another noteworthy feature of this complex is the presence, to the north of the large structure and in about the same orientation as the long axis of the small structure, of another large stone slab (V in fig. 1), measuring approximately ninety centimeters by sixty centimeters by twelve centimeters, and found standing vertically in the level 4 sediments (its base is one of the ninety centimeter sides). The slab is more or less rectangular, and its position, at an 80 degree angle to the horizontal, clearly indicates that it was placed upright in that location deliberately. It has kept its vertical position only because it was chocked firmly at the base by several large stone blocks which held it up as deposits accumulated around it. THE STONE FACE Presiding over all these associated features, from a position directly overlooking the small structure (in the middle of its southeast side), was a good-sized vertical stone (M in fig. 1), one of whose surfaces, that facing the structure and the old cave entrance, had been deliberately transformed into a semi- human face (see fig. 2; for an artist's rendering of the face, see fig. 3). The stone measures thirty-five by thirty-two centi- meters and is twenty-one centimeters thick. Its composition is peculiar, since its upper part is sandstone, grading gradually into limestone at the base. A local geological contact between sandstones and limestones can be traced through the near vicinity of the cave and outcrops just a few meters from the cave mouth; the stone must have been collected at that contact. We are primarily interested in the face itself, but the upper surface of the stone has also been altered. It has been flattened by blows, and the upper corners of the roughly triangular original block have been broken away to make its shape cor- respond more closely to that of a head. Some four centimeters 10 El Juyo</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions below its upper edge, a deeply engraved line runs the whole width of the "forehead," and other discontinuous engraved lines parallel the first on the right side of the face. These may represent the hairline or the lower edge of some sort of head covering. Given the peculiar nature of the entity depicted, we must now describe separately each side of the face, right and left, in spite of the fact that both are integrated into a single figure. Beginning with the face's (own) right, the first notable FIG. 2.-The sculpted face from the El Juyo sanctuary. The smaller stone at right was placed in its present location by the Magdalenian cave occupants to wedge the face more firmly in place. It is not a part of the block of which the face was made. 11</page><page sequence="12">feature is an eye, the hollow made when a shallow flake of stone was removed by percussion. The hollow is somewhat ovoid with its widest end tilted downward. The tip of the nose is indicated by an engraved line which departs from a central fissure in the rock and rises in a shallow curve to the viewer's left, where it is continued by a series of other, less deeply engraved lines. Somewhat lower, we see a shallow engraved line enclosing a lanceolate form, pointed and directed to the face's right, which suggests a moustache. (Other examples of human figures with moustaches are known in Paleolithic art.) To represent the mouth, the artist has taken advantage of a natural curved fissure in the rock; the central part of this fis- sure has been regularized by engraving to strengthen the shape of the lips and to suggest teeth. The general impression thus produced is that of a smiling mouth. The lower edge of FIG. 3.-Artist's freehand drawing of the El Juyo face El Juyo 12</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions the stone is naturally wavy-"festooned" is the best descrip- tion-and the festoons have been retouched by (sometimes deep) engraving to suggest a beard of moderate length. The eye on the left side of the face is a deep, more or less triangular hole, formed by the interior of a fossil embedded in the rock. A concavity suggesting the tear duct extends some distance below, and the inner corner of the eye meets a deep natural fissure in the rock which produces a clean-cut division of the face into two halves. The upper part of this crack has been artificially regularized to form a superciliary area, which is prolonged downward to produce the upper border of an animal-like muzzle. The nose is indicated by engraving which in part seems to continue the curved line of the nose on the right side, but here the single curve is combined with other lines, making a curved triangle with a central horizontal slash that suggests an animal's nose with nostril. The natural cleft that suggested the mouth on the right side only extends over a few centimeters on the left side, and here too it has been intentionally regularized. When it ends, the line of the crack is prolonged by an engraved double line; a pointed salient departs from the upper line of the pair, sug- gesting a sharp tooth. The area above the "upper lip" is speckled with dots of black paint of various sizes. Above and beside the eye, between the nose and upper lip and over the chin, several shallow engraved lines appear. The central fissure widens toward the base of the stone, becoming a deep curved groove which bounds the more or less regular triangular form of the chin on the left side of the face. Finally, the lower sur- face of the stone is naturally flattened, and served as a stable base holding the face in its correct vertical position. The block was also wedged in position by piles of smaller stones at its rear and sides, encased in clay cement. Evidently, however, there was no support against the face itself, and its features remained visible during the use of the structural complex. THE SANCTUARY: SECOND PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION Some time after the horizontal slab had been set atop the large mound, its surface was in turn covered by several layers of flat stones in a matrix of yellow earth. These layers form another mound, some thirty centimeters high, atop the slab. On each side of this mound we found a circular pit (Ps in fig. 1) some 13</page><page sequence="14">thirty centimeters in diameter by twenty-five centimeters in depth. The bottom of each was lined with small stones, and they were filled with a mass of limpet shells, burnt bones, and stone tools. The pit on the northeast side partly interfered with the top of the stony mound; its edge was marked by a small wall constructed of three layers of flat stones in a clay mortar. On the western edge of the structural complex, we found a more or less rectangular platform, some 130 centimeters long, made of stones of varying dimensions. Near its north end were two shallow circular fireplaces (H in fig. 1). On several occa- sions, ashes had been cleaned from these hearths and scattered on the adjacent platform (and even on the mound covering the stone slab). The hearths were eventually covered with another layer of small stones. INTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURAL COMPLEX The characteristics of the complex just described are so pecu- liar that it clearly cannot be interpreted as just one more part of the normal living area where daily economic tasks were undertaken. This is indicated by several facts. If we exclude the debris in the fill layers, only certain selected animal bones were found in the rest of the structures: bones of the feet (especially phalanges), ribs, and mandible fragments of red deer and roe deer are the parts in question. As mentioned earlier, the foot bones were sometimes found in their correct anatomical positions, suggesting that they were deposited with flesh adhering. In these same layers we recovered a piece of white clay and several large lumps of red ochre, which are rare in the rest of level 4. In special places in and on the mounds we found intact bone spearpoints; more than half the remnants of spearpoints from level 4 came from the large mound, and none of the pieces found outside the mounds is complete. These facts suggest that the objects in question were carefully placed into the structure as a sort of offering. We might say the same for the bone needles, recovered whole and sometimes in vertical positions in the pits. The form of the structures and the peculiar way in which they were built also call for an explanation from beyond the realm of ordinary domestic activities. As examples, we may cite the careful disposition of the regular lots of earth which El Juyo 14</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions go to form the bulk of the mounds, either in rosettes or in double lines; the fact that the several rosettes were plastered over with clay of vividly different colors; the sprinkling of red ochre over the whole at several different stages of construction; the channel uniting the two mounds, by which something organic and greasy was evidently poured from the small struc- ture into the large one; the vertical antler tine found in the middle of an ochre layer in the bottom of the larger trench; the positioning of the two large slabs, one horizontally over the large structure, the other on edge nearby; the symmetry of spatial relationships, with pits between and at either end of the two mounds, other pits on either side of the large horizontal slab, the vertical slab oriented parallel to the small mound and both perpendicular to the large one; and, finally, the very presence of these enigmatic mound-trench complexes, which have no apparent economic explanation. The behavior involved in the construction of this structural aggregate is obviously symbolic and its meaning obscure. The size of the structural complex and the weight of some of its components (the two large slabs), as well as the compli- cated details of construction (particularly in phase 1), make it evident that we are not dealing here with the whimsical behav- ior of a single person. Its construction required the participation of a large number of people, ten to fifteen at the very least. Furthermore, the size and orientation of the whole (particu- larly after completion of construction phase 2) would have had an immediate visual impact on persons entering the cave from outside. This suggests that the complex was constructed to impress an audience of living people. A second characteristic of religious behavior as we defined it earlier-that it is shared symbolic behavior-is manifest in these details. The last element of our definition is also present. The great face, presiding from its dominant position over the whole complex, is not a representation of any living thing but a supernatural being, whose nature we shall now explore. THE FACE IN THE SANCTUARY From the description given above and an examination of the photograph and drawing (figs. 2 and 3), the reader will realize that the stone face represents a being whose nature is dual, although the two sides of its character have been harmoniously 15</page><page sequence="16">integrated into one single face. The proper right side of the face is that of an adult male human, with moustache and beard. The proper left side is a large carnivore, with oblique eye, large lachrymal, and a moderately long nose, ending in a good depiction of a naked rhinarium. The chin is triangular, and a sharply pointed tooth projects above the mouth. On the muzzle there are three subparallel lines of black spots suggest- ing the bases of whiskers or vibrissae, a characteristic feature of felids. Taken as a whole, these features represent a large cat, probably a lion or leopard (both existed near El Juyo in Magdalenian times). When seen from a distance, the sculpture gives a unified impression, that of a typical "anthropomorph" like others in Paleolithic art-a stylized human face. On the other hand, to appreciate the details indicating the dual nature of the being depicted, a viewer must approach the face very closely and examine it with great care under the appropriate illumination. Artists so capable that they could convincingly portray the features of a felid or a man with such economy of means-a few blows, scratches, and dots of paint-could obviously have exaggerated those features to make them perceptible at a dis- tance. Consequently, it seems likely that this representation was actually intended to be read at two levels: it had a public, exoteric meaning (the human caricature), accessible to all who entered the cave, and an occult, esoteric significance (the synthesis of a dual nature, animal and human, into a har- monious whole), known only to those who had been shown its mysteries. As an artistic creation, the El Juyo face is without parallel in the Paleolithic world. It stands out in the first place because, although it is not permanently fixed in position, it was obvi- ously not intended to be moved: it is too large and heavy to be really portable. In this respect it brings to mind a few other Paleolithic discoveries: the large sculpted blocks with animals in high relief from Fourneau du Diable8 and the clay sculptures of bison from Tuc d'Audoubert,9 for example. However, in theme the El Juyo piece is totally unlike those works. It is also unique compared with other Paleolithic anthropomorphic representations, since in general those either have completely human features or human bodies with heads which have been 8 D.

El Juyo 16</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions grotesquely altered, sometimes resulting in their total con- version to animals' heads. But there is no other case in Paleo- lithic art of a face divided by a midline into two halves, each with a different nature. NOTES TOWARD A FUTURE INTERPRETATION The half animal, half human aspect of the being that presides over the El Juyo sanctuary immediately makes one think of rites dedicated to a master of the game or protector of the animals. Although this superficial interpretation may hold some small grain of truth, it leaves most of the details of the figure and its sanctuary unexplained. The structures of the sanctuary, and the face itself, present so many evident contrasts or "complementary oppositions" (contrasts involving the use of colors; the spatial patterning of elements of the mound fills; the size, orientation, and content of the trenches and mounds; vertical as opposed to horizontal elements; the differential disposition of spearpoints [in the large mounds] and needles [in the pits], suggestive of a sexual division of labor; the projecting antler vs. the hollow depression; the two sides of the stone face) that they would be a fruitful field for structural analysis, following a current ethnological model. We have resisted the temptation to pursue that sort of analysis at this time because the deeper significance of sym- bolic systems so analyzed can only be determined, and con- clusions can only be verified, when the analysis is based on the testimony of living informants. (But it is interesting to note that on occasion, when faced with incomplete ethnographic data, Levi-Strauss himself has suggested "hypotheses with regard to the logical nature of classification"10 and on occasion has even used archeological data as grist for his interpretive mill.)l' Since there are no living informants who could describe the El Juyo rituals in their integrity, we must look for possible hints about the meanings of documented behavior in observa- tions about human nature which are supposed to have very general or universal validity. Two fields offer the sorts of generalizations we seek: psychology and the comparative study of religions. 10 C. Levi-Strauss, The Savage Mind (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966), p. 57. " C.

The formal rigor with which lots of dirt were positioned to make up the mound fill and the regular application of colored clay to the patterns so formed might be interpreted, according to the theories of this school, as the outward symbolic manifestation of a primitive stage in the psychic development of the individual; while the presence of an antler tine thrust vertically into the center of an ochre-lined trench, and the intimate communication of the two mounds by means of a narrow channel which served to conduct some greasy liquid substance from the smaller structure to the inte- rior of the larger, would seem to correspond very well to the symbolic expression of a new and maturer emotional orienta- tion toward the "secrets" of reproduction. The combination of symbols of these two stages into a single structural complex might itself symbolize the transition from one to the other in the process of psychic development. According to the followers of Jung's "depth psychology," the figure that presides over the sanctuary and to some degree condenses and concentrates its symbolism-the stone face, half wild beast, half man-would be a symbol of the dual nature of personality, its left side standing for the savage, unconscious, instinctive side of our nature, its right our controlled, consciously "human," and social side. Then, the admirably harmonic fusion of these two natures in a single figure would be a graphic representation of their integration during the individuation process. Despite the fact that different aspects of the sanctuary com- plex are here subjected to treatment from the quite distinctive viewpoints of these two systems of psychological theory, there would be a certain coincidence in the two interpretations. In the first place, each school would almost certainly interpret the bulk of the symbolism employed in the sanctuary as most appropriate to the masculine personality in its process of maturation. Furthermore, both schools recognize that transi- tions in the psychic maturation of the individual are enhanced and facilitated among so-called primitive peoples by initiation rites which mark the passage of the individual from a juvenile social status to the condition of adult and full member of society. As a general rule, periodic elaborate rituals are staged by several already initiated persons to induct groups (usually age sets) of uninitiated boys; girls' puberty ceremonies usually involve fewer participants, and, though they may also require 18 El Juyo</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions a complex series of formal behavior patterns, these are gener- ally orchestrated by a small number of adult women on behalf of a single girl, who is often secluded from the rest of society throughout the whole initiation process. Mircea Eliade has called attention to the fundamental importance of rites of initiation among the immense majority of peoples, nowadays and in ancient times. He has noted that the divinity presiding over those rites frequently assumes the form of a large carnivore, such as a lion, leopard, or jaguar, and that the state of transition between this world and the supernatural realm is often symbolized by the imitation by initiates of the behavior of these wild beasts.12 Elsewhere, he has observed that the "reconciliation of opposed principles" is among the oldest and most widely diffused symbols of the "paradoxical state of the totality, the perfection and, conse- quently, the sacredness of God."'3 From this standpoint, then, one might interpret the "mask" at El Juyo as the representa- tion of a supernatural being who presided over rites of initi- ation, and whose double and contradictory nature incorporated the concept of transcendence and served as a means of com- munication between the real world of nature and a higher reality. Despite the evident contradictions between these theoretical positions, the fact that all coincide (in data like those dis- cussed above) in seeing symbols suggesting a process of transi- tion or maturation from one biological, psychic, and social state to another-possibly figuratively embodied in rites of initiation, implying the concerted action of at least the mascu- line members of a Paleolithic society-seems to us to be a datum of some significance. Although extensive familiarity with ethnographic facts produces a healthy skepticism about the value of such uncontrolled and uncritical comparisons, they are nonetheless suggestive enough in this case to warrant further consideration as interpretation of the El Juyo sanc- tuary progresses.
