Most obviously, the screen peculiarly human instinct that leads the human being to of language encloses us. Coleridge writes of how even the find or to make meaning in the world.

The instinct "engenders" the belief that a anthropomorphic qualities to the space he examines; often coherence "out there" corresponds to the coherence we he does so without realizing it, because these qualities are imagine we perceive.

The belief in oneness, but enable him to inhabit a world of things fictionalized for example, is easily "disfigured." The instinct leads to as he likes it. 30</page><page sequence="3">Indeed, the phrase about the essential oneness of nature and human intelligence is as skewed from its con text as is the other phrase "the one Life within us and abroad," which is also used to prove Coleridge's faith in the unity of the created world. "The one Life within us and abroad" from the poem "The Eolian Harp" is also read out of its context in the poem to which it was a late ad dition; moreover, it is given the force of statement when it, too, is a hypothesis. It comes in a long line of imagi native speculations that fill up "the mute still air" and give meaning to "the desultory breeze," populating the silence with coy maids, lovers, elfins, birds of paradise, the one Life within us and abroad, and other "idle flitting phan tasies," and "many a thought uncalled and undetained."4 These "shapings of the unregenerate mind" are offered quizzically by the musing farmer, briefly uprooted from his intellectual milieu, casting about for significance in his bean field and in the uncomprehending expression of his uneducated wife. He tosses out possibilities — And what if all of animated nature Be but organic Harps diversely fram'd, That tremble into thought, as o'er them sweeps Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze, At once the Soul of each, and God of all? — and fills his bucolic emptiness with meaning, because he instinctively seeks a correspondence with his own life, "a something analogous to the causality of the human will," unable to endure the blankness around him without filling it with his speculations, fancies, visions, sermons, and "books in the running streams." The instinct for meaning is as deeply imbedded in the human being as several other instincts that Coleridge finds in his search to define man as unique in creation. The instinct for immortality, the instinct for love and fam ily, and the instinct to be unsatisfied are analogous to ani mal instincts but different in kind, separated from animal instinct by a chasm. Coleridge works to mark our "con tradistinction to that world" that we imagine we resemble. The chasm between man and nature breaks open in his work from the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" to the Philosophical Lectures and beyond, for the discontinuity of man from the continuum of nature is central to his hopes that human beings do not share the fate of or ganisms, that the human spirit evades the death of the natural body. Such dualism was long ago postulated in a warning essay by A.O. Lovejoy: "one characteristic thing in the so called Romantic influence was a revolt against naturalism, an ethical and metaphysical dualism, a philosophy of two worlds. I mention this because some eminent literary crit ics and historians have represented the whole Romantic influence as of quite the opposite character. There could scarcely be a greater historical error."5 Only recently have antithetical critics returned by round-about routes to this dualistic position. Harold Bloom and Paul de Man posit the struggle of consciousness for autonomy.6 Edward Kess ler recognizes Coleridge's hostility to nature, his "dread of being identified with matter."7 Valiantly struggling to defeat the Lockean view of the mind's dependence on en vironment, Coleridge asserts the activity of the apprehend ing mind, seeking and finding analogies and differences according to inwardly generated patterns. In so doing he anticipates many of the arguments of recent students of mind such as Noam Chomsky and Douglas Hofstadter.8 He rejects the power of external nature to mold human intelligence; instead, he finds that outer puzzles are solved by a mysterious, deeply grounded instinct, which in part distinguishes the human being, and which Coleridge labors to define and locate. I hope that the preceding has laid to rest the use of part of a sentence in the Essays on Method to bolster a position passionately opposed by Coleridge. In addition, I hope that this sentence, when seen in context, and in a network of similar statements on the nature of the human being, will carry more than a merely semantic, lin guicentric significance, will add to truth, not merely to an interplay of intertexts, competing discourses, and interpre tations in margins; and will serve an end, point to a mean ing below the veiled surfaces of his language. For Col eridge was committed to "A HUNGERING AND THIRSTING AFTER TRUTH," and truth "must be found within us before it can be intelligibly reflected back on the mind from without" (Fr. I, 495).
