<plain_text><page sequence="1">Contemporary Art Michael Mazur (American, b. 1935) Spring Blues for Larry, 1 989 Acrylic on panel, 24 x 96 in. (61 x 243.8 cm.) Gift of Michael Mazur in Memory of Larry Hill, 1937-1988. 1989.341 Michael Mazur, one of New England's preemi- nent figurative painters and printmakers, com- pleted Spring Blues for Larry in 1 989 as a memo- rial to Larry Hill, a minister at Harvard University and the conductor of the Back Bay Chorale, in which Mazur sang. This beautifully rendered por- trait of a tree is hauntingly anthropomorphic. The tree branch extends like a limb from the trunk, or torso, reminding Mazur of references to the Cross as well as to a lifeline. The wooden framing suggests a window, or a slice of life. The tree Mazur has represented grows in Houston's Glen- wood Cemetery. This is the first painting of Mazur's to enter the Department of Contempo- rary Art, although many of his works on paper have been acquired by the Department of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs. K.H. Jenny Holzer (American, b. 1950) Untitled (to be commissioned) Light-emitting diode (LED) sign Ernest Wadsworth Longfellow Fund The Department of Contemporary Art will acquire by commission a light-emitting diode (LED) sign by Jenny Holzer, to be installed at the entrance to the Henry and Lois Foster Gallery. This will be Holzer's first permanent commission. The sign, including a unique program compiled by Holzer, would convey three types of information or au- thorial voices: a series of the artist's aphorisms reviewed by the curator, news bulletins provided by a telephone link to a wire service such as United Press International (UPI), and information pertaining to the Foster Gallery, such as the name of the gallery, title of the current exhibition, and a listing of related educational activities. These informational connections link the Mu- seum's activities to the world outside its walls and contemporary art to the events of the day. Jenny Holzer's art is site-specific, an impassioned yet coolly conceived investigation of the intersec- tion of public and private in the age of Big Brother electronics, congressional attacks on freedom of 26</page><page sequence="2">speech, and a fading federal social conscience. HÃ¶lzer considers all truth arbitrary. Her "truisms" sound obvious and correct, but, in fact, the reader's own experience covertly invests the work with particular value judgments. Although her early aphorisms suggested the work of a pop- ulist Samuel Beckett, bleak yet streaked with black humor, Holzer's recent tone is increasingly urgent, as intensely colored and agitated as the digitized type of the LED. It is as if she can no longer afford to stand behind the seductively minimal boxes housing the mechanical memory that powers her text but must come forward, before expression is prohibited and imagination censored.

Sarah Charlesworth (American, b. 1 947) Of Myself, 1989 Laminated cibachrome with lacquered frame, edition of 4; 78 x 57 in. (1 98.1 x 1 44.8 cm.) Tompkins Collection. 1990.53 Temple of My Father, 1 989 Laminated cibachrome with lacquered frame, edition of 4; 78 x 57 in. (198.1 x 144.8 cm.) Tompkins Collection. 1990.54 Sarah Charlesworth is a New York artist who makes exquisite photographic objects in very small editions. Her finished statement involves a laminated cibachrome in a lacquered frame of specified color: the cibachrome reproduces and unifies a collage she has made with "found" images, cut out from a variety of sources and then attached to a monochrome background. Her techniques and materials allude to those of out- door advertising and glossy magazine layouts, and she deliberately invests this commercial sys- tem with her own analysis of the symbols and icons that fuel desire as promoted in advertising. Though not made as a pair, Temple of My Father and Of Myself belong to the same body of work and together comment on male and female iden- tity. Temple of My Father links such things as snakes, swords, mushrooms, skulls, and crowned heads. The photographic images con- nect various epochs; for example, the king's head is a stone object from the Middle Ages, whereas the snake is cut from a recent magazine such as National Geographic or Horticulture. The tonality of Temple of My Father is black, sug- gesting the mystery and potentially evil connota- tions of male power, while Of Myself is blood- red, suggesting the vibrancy of the female life- force. The latter's visual vocabulary follows a nar- rower frame of selection, dominated by vessels and containers, which are compared to anatomy- book cross-sections of the female reproductive organs. The symbols used in these two works clearly allude to Freudian definitions of the oppos- ing sexes. Charlesworth demonstrates how read- ily this sign system and the color coding lend themselves to advertising that targets subcon- scious male or female associations. These works exemplify the postmodern point of view that sees the world as a continuum of images in which the historical blurs with the new and in which meanings constantly shift according to how well we are able to read a given combination of signs. In gathering together what appear to be very basic classifications of the male and female, Charlesworth radically unveils the mechanism of sexual stereotyping. T.F. 27</page></plain_text>
