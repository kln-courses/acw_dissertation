Oxford, Oxford University Press, vii, 281 pp. Pr. £50.00 (hb). ISBN 9780199245499. In his preface to Forms of Astonishment, Buxton reveals that the book arose from his quest for an answer to a question that has occupied him for many years: "How far were the Greeks like ourselves?" Greek mythology offers us a way to address this and other questions, especially those concerning metamorphoses. In short, Buxton defines metamorphosis as "the breaking in of the astonishing upon the ordinary" (3). Reviewing briefly the history of representations of metamorphosis, Buxton examines significant moments in Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Meta morphoses, and various other texts from antiquity to the present, and reminds us that metamorphic beliefs are fundamental to Egyptian and Chinese culture as well. Finally, he notes that modern cinema represents metamorphosis for us with previously impossible animation and vividness. The ubiquity of such visual trans formations leads Buxton to wonder if they are not "in the process of being reposi tioned—shifting, that is, from the astonishing to the expected" (18). Given the impact on audiences of the almost awe-inspiring three-dimensional computer generated images of the recent film Avatar, I would guess that astonishment will continue to accompany new visual transformations created by such ground-break ing technological advances. Because his approach is textually based, Buxton sets out the Greek words used to denote metamorphosis, which range from words associated with change, exchange, appearance, and the process of becoming to those applying to gods who cause change in others, such as making and putting (into a certain condition), to the effect of the changes on others, such as consternation and astonishment. Finally, given all their stories of metamorphosis, Buxton poses several questions about Greek mentality that he wants to explore: "Did Greeks take the possibility of metamorphosis seriously'? If they did take it seriously, did they do so all the time, or only some of the time, or only in some context?" (24). In Chapter 1, "The Odyssey", Buxton argues for the centrality of transformation in the epic, opening with the scene in Book 3 in which Athena takes her leave from Telemachos, hospitably received in Pylos: 'So saying, green-eyed Athene went away, likening herself to a vulture, and astonishment (thambos) took hold of all those who were looking, and the old man was amazed (thaumazen), as he saw it with his eyes' (371-3). Focusing on the phrase (pr|vri ei8ouevr|, Buxton examines the ways in which prominent classicists have translated it (as the goddess taking on the likeness or form of a bird). There is, however, an alternative interpretation of the phrase as a simile put forth by others in which Athena does not actually transform, but rather departs like a bird, with speed.

In short, such divine theriomorphic metamorphoses undermine the firmly anthropomor phic conception of the Greek gods. Next, Buxton examines the presupposition that Athena-as-Mentor Vanishes' after which people see a bird flying off, which serves to "bleach out some of the strangeness of what we actually have before us" (33), that is, the intermediate stages of the process of metamorphosis. The strange ness of such scenes leads Buxton to wonder "just how 'astonishing' are the events portrayed in Homeric narrative?" (35). He posits another scene in Odyssey Book 1 involving Athena as a way to approach the question. 'Likened' to Mentes, Athene interacts with Telemachos as a trusted advisor before taking her leave in lines 319 23, when she opviq 8' (6q avojtoua Sternaio. This passage elicits controversy both in terms of the same 'metamorphosis-versus-simile' question discussed above and of attempts by scholars uncomfortable with divine transformation to translate away Mentes' 'levitation' through a smoke-vent in the roof with a process of his vanishing and reappearance as a flying bird. Buxton then examines Proteus and Circe as the deities most closely identified with metamorphosis in the poem before concentrating on the ways in which Odysseus transforms himself and is trans formed by Athena in Ithaka. He argues that "the Odyssey presents us with a spec trum of kinds of transformation. At one end we have 'mere' similes... At the other end we have Proteus, and the victims of Circe, and Athene-as-Mentes; about all of these the narrative leaves no room for doubt that a corporeal transformation is to be understood to have taken place. Between these extremes is a range of textual phenomena, some inclining towards the status of simile, some seeming to imply full bodily transformation, many, though, resisting such binary analysis: for it is sometimes impossible to decide, on the basis of the text, whether what is at stake is a transformation or a comparison" (46). Moreover, "certain kinds of change-of form are central, integral, pervasive" (46). Unlike other narratives that show humans transformed into animals or plant life, however, Homeric epic does not allow humans to escape life in any way but death. In Chapter 2, "Athenian Drama", Buxton examines the use of transformation in tragedy and comedy as a plot point in order to show generic differences and to begin to address the question of how seriously the Greeks took metamorphosis. He begins with Euripides' Bacchants, when Dionysos declares that he has changed his divine form for mortal. Arguing that metamorphosis is "a central feature of the play's power to unsettle and unnerve", Buxton makes the case that it "guides us into the heart of the plays meaning, in relation to the ultimate distinction between humanity and divinity" (52-3), expressed succinctly in line 1388: 'Many are the forms of divinity'. Another tragedy featuring transformation is Prometheus Bound.</page><page sequence="3">De novis libris indicia / C.A. Clark / Mnemosyne 64 (2011) 677-684 679 At line 674 Io comes onstage wearing horns, which as "an astonishing irruption of mortality into the world of the gods" inverts the usual pattern of metamorphosis as "the irruption of the sacred into the everyday world of mortals" (55-6). Analyz ing the reaction of the internal audience to Io, Buxton concludes that "there is nothing which ridicules or in any other way undermines the terrifying convinc ingness with which Io's disoriented madness is portrayed. Within the frame of the tragic genre, her metamorphosis is unquestionably 'taken seriously'" (56). The author then examines a different tragic pattern that references impending meta morphosis, seen in Sophokles' Tereus and Euripides' Hekabe. Buxton interrogates the mythical logic of certain future transformations, such as Hekabe's into a bitch and Kadmos' into a snake, in which form he will drive an ox-pulled wagon. Schol ars have puzzled over the prophecy of Kadmos' fate: "the idea of a snake driving an ox-cart is felt to be just too weird to be acceptable, or at least to be taken 'seri ously'" (61). Buxton includes ancient commentators' descriptions of paintings which depict Kadmos and Harmonia registering amazement with their facial expressions and gestures as they undergo transformation; however, he also observes that even Ovid omits the ox-cart from his account of the tale (61 n. 38 and 39). We cannot determine whether audiences perceived such metamorphic descrip tions as ridiculous, or not. But Buxton asserts that the genre "affirms a strong sense of the ultimate boundedness, integrity, and centrality of the human form", unlike Aristophanic comedy. Using the Birds and other plays to examine the function of comic transformation, Buxton argues in this world it is entirely believable that someone could metamorphose: indeed, this genre "thrives on games with form, on the bodying-forth of metaphors" (71). Chapter 3, "Visual Arts", investigates metamorphosis in visual narrative. Such images challenge viewers who must decide if what is being represented is transfor mation or hybridity. Buxton looks at depictions of changed gods, especially Zeus in sexual pursuit of mortal women. All such images show Zeus fully transformed, avoiding hybridity and thus monstrosity. Divinities with connections to water such as Thetis and Acheloos are represented differently. Whereas Acheloos appears in triple form (snake-bull-man), Thetis avoids monstrosity when artists depict her anthropomorphically surrounded by the creatures into which she transforms her self to fight Peleus. Turning from visual narratives of divine transformations to those of human metamorphosis, Buxton examines representations of Circe trans forming men into pigs, wolves and lions. In order to make clear that these are metamorphosed humans, artists depict them in hybrid form, partly human, partly animal, in a "synchronic dramatization of a diachronic set of events" (92). Artists used a variety of ways to represent transformation: some of the transformed men have human faces but animal bodies, while others have animal heads on human bodies. This leads Buxton to wonder if there is a "difference... in their degree of</page><page sequence="4">680 De novis libris iudicia / C.A. Clark / Mnemosyne 64 (2011) 677-684 'strangeness'?" only to conclude that "strangeness is in the eye of the beholder" (97). Most interesting is Buxton's examination of representations of Aktaion that focus on the moment of his punishment for seeing Artemis naked. Visual artists depict his transformation into a stag and subsequent death by his own hounds in different ways. Some do not transform him physically at all, some clothe him in a deerskin; others provide him with horns or antlers; the great majority of artists retain his human face. Buxton suggests that to increase the pathos of his horrifying death, artists preferred to portray his facial expressions. The artist who depicted Aktaion in a deerskin keeps both the human and the stag in front of our eyes simultaneously. In the end, we cannot know how Aktaion looked at the moment of his death. In Chapter 4, "Hellenistic Transformation", Buxton studies the collections of tales of metamorphosis put together by Hellenistic writers "in order to offer aitia for present conditions" (111). Focusing on the work of Apollonios of Rhodes and Moschos, Buxton shows how these poets made use of earlier tales even as they innovated. In Chapter 5, "Post-Hellenistic Narratives", we see that "metamorpho sis was 'good to think with'" in many ways, such as Pausanias' exploration of the credibility of myths, Plutarch's dramatization of "the debate about whether ani mals possess reason" (135), and Artemidoros' interpretation of dreams. Buxton notes that while Pausanias expresses doubt about deification of mortals, he does not disbelieve in the metamorphoses of people like Lykaon and Niobe. Lastly, Buxton discusses Nonnos' Dionysiaka, an epic poem dominated by metamorpho sis and which invokes Proteus at the beginning, alerting audiences to the impor tance of transformation to the work. However, Buxton argues that Nonnos' narrative differs from others in that "where everythingis astonishing, no individual episode stands out as arousing thambos" (147). In particular, Nonnos' account of the conception of Dionysos highlights metamorphosis as Zeus takes on the forms of a variety of animals in Semele's bed. Semele's story is important, in that it con firms "one of the constant lessons of the mythological tradition, that relations between gods and mortals can normally be conducted only if the mitigating shield of metamorphosis intervenes between the parties" (150). Gods transform for sex ual gratification, to escape, and to persuade. Dionysos transforms himself and others, but even he is amazed at the transformation of his favorite Ampelos from corpse to grape vine. In "Part II: The Logic of Transformation", Buxton seeks recurrent patterns unconfined by genre. Examining three additional aspects of transformation and Greek ideas of divinity in Chapter 6, "The Shapes of the Gods", Buxton wonders "how anthropomorphic was Greek religion?" Given that all gods "have the poten tial for self-transformation" (177), Buxton explores several reasons for why Greek</page><page sequence="5">De novis libris iudicia / C.A. Clark / Mnemosyne 64 (2011) 677-684 681 gods transform themselves, the first of which is erotic passion. Such unions between transformed gods and mortal women usually generate normal human children, not monstrous ones, such as the Minotaur, the product of intercourse between Pasiphae and a real bull. Deities also transform to escape from situations such as unwanted erotic passion (although this is largely confined to goddesses) or attack (e.g. by Typhon). Gods also transform to help or to harm. When they do transform, they astonish mortal onlookers with their true nature, although the way this astonishment is portrayed varies by genre. Especially thought-provoking is Buxton's discussion of how the "unique intimacy" of the bond between Achilles and Thetis in the Iliad is expressed through Achilles' lack of astonishment when recognizing his goddess mother, extraordinary because the epic "elsewhere so insistently stresses the gulf between mortality and immortality" (167). Reading this section, I found myself comparing this portrayal of a loving, intimate rela tionship between mortal hero and goddess mother with that depicted in Vergil's Aeneid, when Aeneas heartbreakingly asks Venus why she never interacts with him except through transformation when he longs to 'join hand to hand' with her (1.405-10). Lastly, Buxton briefly outlines the various ways different religions have dealt with divine anthropomorphism before posing the question in terms of Greece. While some Greek thinkers such as Empedokles, Plato, and Aristotle cast doubt on traditional anthropomorphism, other strands of Greek thought imply that "some aspects of divinity cannot fully be captured by an exclusively human model of what a god looks like" (184). Divinities are also represented by stones, wooden pillars, trees, and animals, and are associated with other forms. Buxton documents examples of divine hybridity before returning to a discussion of de Visser's evolutionary view of Greek divinities as originally non-anthropomorphic, then largely anthropomorphic, based largely on evidence presented in two sources, Pausanias and Clement of Alexandria. Buxton asserts that instead of providing evidence for an evolutionary development of Greek thought about the divine, "it is preferable to use a model stressing the coexistence of multiple forms of divinity" (189). Even so, the predominant mode was anthropomorphic, as the gods were shown to resume their anthropomorphic forms after transformations into other shapes. These stories remind us that the power of gods "may break out, to the benefit or for the destruction of mortals... [They] express this sense of danger and promise with literally astonishing force" (190). In Chapter 7, "The Human Aetiology of Landscape", Buxton looks at how the Greeks conceived of the landscape as permeated by immanent divine power, often expressed through stories of metamorphosis into rivers, springs, mountains, rocks, and islands. Rivers and springs were often thought to be the end results of sexual union or transformation as a result of unhappy erotic passion; the metamorphoses</page><page sequence="6">682 De novis libris iudicia / C.A. Clark / Mnemosyne 64 (2011) 677-684 occur in the remote past and their consequences extend to the present day. As Buxton observes, such stories "rested on assumptions embedded in religious cult... Certain features of the landscape thus already had about them an air of the uncanny, expressed in ritual practice; the idea that metamorphosis had once played a part in their genesis was merely an extension of such perceived sacredness" (206-7). Mortals who transform have varying fates: some are doomed to be "eter nally fluid and restless" (199) as water while others become rooted as earth or rock. Some experience sudden reversals of fortune that cause them literally to dis solve with grief and to transform into springs or fountains (e.g. Byblis, Peirene). On the other hand, the formerly active Atlas and Niobe become mountain and rock, respectively. These natural features of the landscape "signify, through the still-visible evidence of transformational genesis, the living persistence of the mythological past" (202). Did the Greeks really 'believe' these stories about their landscapes? Buxton asserts that the "Greeks themselves were perfectly well aware that belief in myths was variable' (207), and uses a passage from Plato's Phaidros to illustrate this (229a-230b). Buxton continues his examination of transformed landscapes in Chapter 8, "Plants, Trees, and Human Form". Greek beliefs in the permeability of the bound ary between human and plant life can be found in stories of trees, possessing their "own sacred individuality" (210) as nymphs, and from which, some said, human beings originated (e.g. Hesiod, Works and Days 143-5). Next, Buxton considers the generative role of various bodily fluids such as milk, tears, and blood in gener ating elements of the landscape. Tears, in particular, "link an emotional event from the mythical past to a contemporary feature of the natural world" (216), as when Aphrodite weeps at Adonis' death; his blood generates roses while her tears generate anemones. Building on R.B. Onian's argument linking tears with a fluid that is a "distillation" of human aicbv, Buxton shows that in myths such as that of Adonis "the culturally acknowledged idea of the centrality and potency of tears reaches a special degree of intensity as a result of the pathos created by the myth tellers' narratives... mingled with earth, tears actually generate a new form of life" (217). While many cultures ascribe generative powers to divinities' tears, Greek myths are distinctive in that they give the same to the tears of heroes and heroines (Helen, Lykourgos). Sanguinary metamorphoses into plants, commonly triggered by the violent death of youths, mitigate the resulting miasma—"the plants gener ated from blood are, so far from being baneful, seen as useful and/or beautiful features of the living world" (227). The youths die "at the height of their sexual potential... before that potential can be converted into generative power within a formalized sexual relationship with a woman" (227). Consequently, their blood</page><page sequence="7">De novis libris indicia / C.A. Clark / Mnemosyne 64 (2011) 677-684 683 retains its power to create new life. One feature of life as a plant or tree is rooted ness, which may be why divinities do not transform themselves into these things. Buxton turns to "Challenges to the Metamorphic Tradition" in Chapter 9, in which he argues that "the two major types of metamorphosis tale, relating to transformations of gods and transformations of mortals, provoked varying and sometimes rigorous reactions" from philosophical and religious thinkers, who, while not embodying mainstream Greek beliefs, nevertheless contributed to Greek ideas about metamorphosis (231). First, some Presocratic philosophers such as Xenophanes challenged the idea that gods could change, while others, such as Herakleitos, embraced it. Thinkers such as Anaximenes who believed in unitary underlying principles from which everything emerged seem to argue "that the world is pervaded by a process of continuous divine metamorphosis" (233). The Presocratic accounts differ from mythic metamorphic stories, however, by elimi nating astonished reactions to phenomena. Next, Buxton examines Plato's rejec tion of mythic tales of divine transformation because what is by nature perfect cannot transform into something worse. Interestingly, Aristotle embraces aston ishment and wonderment as central to doing philosophy, although his idea of "the unmoved mover" as "the unchanging source of change" (236) differs from con ventional thought. Later, the Stoics and Epicureans rejected divine metamorpho sis. Buxton turns to theories of transmigration of souls, which, unlike most metamorphoses, involve choosing new forms. In the debates between advocates and opponents of these theories, mythology served as "a common cultural lan guage" in which tales of metamorphosis continued to astonish and provoke. In Chapter 10, "Final Thoughts on Contexts", Buxton asks: "How far can a contextual approach to interpretation claim to throw light on a strange, and indeed astonishing, belief such as that of metamorphosis?" (248). Arguing that context is "crucial for a viable approach to the 'astonishing'", Buxton asserts that "the trick is to do the analysis... in such a way as to be alert both to symbolic meaningfulness and to the possibility of absurdity, illogicality, nonsense" (251), something he himself did in his analysis earlier in the book of the symbolism of blood and tears in transformation myths. He acknowledges, however, that we sometimes simply do not know how far to take context in reducing strangeness in a world pervaded by the sacred. While metamorphosis was not part of everyday Greek life, it remained a possibility: "Stories told in this tradition were a way of articulating, and perhaps even partially coping with, the astonishing strangeness of life's outcomes" (252). This is a beautifully written and produced book; although its focus is narrow, the ubiquity of metamorphosis in Greek mythology and thus the classical tradition</page><page sequence="8">684 De novis libris indicia / C.A.
