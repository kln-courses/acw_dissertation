Peter Beyer University of Toronto Joining the long search for what religion fundamentally is, Guthrie offers us a familiar answer in startlingly simple form: religion is anthropomorphism. The latter, in turn, is a rational human strategy for understanding the world around us; but it is also the mistaken attribution of humanness to the nonhuman. Guthrie's core theoretical argument runs roughly as follows: human knowledge is necessarily based on risky interpretations of the world, on guesses that might be wrong. As bets, the meanings we give events are more or less valuable depending on how much</page><page sequence="2">327 significant information they yield, that is, on how well they allow us to go on. In general, the interpretations that have the highest potential for information are the most organized, those with the greatest variety of possible connections to subsequent interpretation and action: "the first bets to cover - those with the biggest payoff - are bets as high on the scale of organization as possible." (45) At the top of the hierarchy of organization in human experience are human beings themselves. Attributing humanness is therefore a good bet; as such it persists and pervades our ways of seeing the world. Religion, as sys- tematic anthropomorphism (3), is thus sensible. Seeing gods in the world around us makes sense, even if it is mistaken. Although one could quibble with various aspects of Guthrie's theory of anthropomor- phism - in particular, whether the attribution of agency and the capacity for symbolic interaction (communication) are not more what is at issue here rather than the more vague concept of anthropomorphism - it is the most interesting and well-argued aspect of the book. Indeed most of the volume is devoted to its presentation, defence, and elaborate illustration. Offering it as a theory of religion, however, may be going too far. The author spends much effort in discussing the strengths and insufficiencies of other conceptions of religion from Aristotle to Bacon, from Hume to Nietzsche, from Durkheim to Horton; and he does a good job in this respect. Yet the straightforward reli- gion as anthropomorphism equation raises its own questions which Guthrie, perhaps caught in the simple elegance of his assumption, does not really address inadequately. For instance, if religion is anthropomorphism, what about religion that refuses to anthropo- morphize? Certain Hindu, Buddhist, and Daoist forms come readily to mind. Guthrie's answer: these are philosophy, not religion. The problem is solved by definitional fiat. Conversely, when one asks whether all anthropomorphism is then religion, the answer is both yes and no; the line between religion and non-religion is unclear and therefore all anthropomorphism is somewhat religious. On the other hand, religion is different from other anthropomorphism in that it takes anthropomorphism more seriously. Above all it attributes the capacity for symbolic communication (not just life or agency) to the nonhuman world and it does so in a "more generalized, systematized, and integrated" (200) fashion. Without further elaboration, however, this distinction suggest that anthropomorphism may after all not be the key defining feature of religion. Instead, it may be, as for instance Spiro claims, "culturally patterned interaction" with these postu- lated human-like beings. Anthropomorphism may be what links religious and much non- religious interpretation, but is not what makes religion religious. For that it would seem that we require at least the conviction that we are at root not mistaken, that we can "dance with the devil in the pale moonlight." A connected problem, therefore, concerns the idea that anthropomorphism is the mis- taken attribution of human characteristics to the non-humans. Essentially, Guthrie demon- strates rather well why and how anthropomorphism persists - it is a good bet as long as we don't know better - but not why religion or serious anthropomorphism persists. To answer this question, he points briefly in promising directions such as the ultimate insuf- ficiency of all our interpretations, habit, and our inescapable anthropocentrism; but he does not pursue these threads. Indeed, the real weakness of the enterprise is that only the last chapter and, within this, only the last ten pages actually work positively and in con- certed fashion toward the promised theory of religion as opposed to a more general theory of anthropomorphism. As such, Guthrie's attempt represents an interesting beginning and perhaps a good summary of the role anthropomorphism has played historically in theories of religion but, as far as religion is concerned, it remains underdeveloped.
