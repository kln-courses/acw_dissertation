<plain_text><page sequence="1">Persephone: Three Essays on Religion and Thought in Magna Graecia. By Gunther Zuntz. New York: Oxford University Press, 1971. Pp. xiii plus 427; 30 plates. $29.00. Comprehensive scholarship and keen acumen in historical and literary anal- ysis mark this substantial and valuable volume. So detailed and varied are the materials that are presented that even the experienced scholar will find dif- ficulty in preserving the necessary or- der in them. Provided among other mat- ters are a searching view of religion and early cult practices in Malta, Si- cily, and elsewhere, and a substantial and comparative analysis of Greek in- fluences, Empedoclean fragments, the Catharmoi , the Physica , the Orphic Gold Leaves, and Mesopotamian ante- cedents. (These latter could have been amplified to include more basic points on Egyptian, Sumerian, and Akkadian rites and symbols, and in the section on Empedocles' Catharmoi , which in- volves precise study of Greek texts, it is often difficult to see any underlying development leading to the establish- ment of an important point.) There is also a competent outline of Persephone in relation to other goddesses and fig- ures of myth, which does not, however, concern itself with her influence on the life and faith of neighboring lands. The cumulative result is a keen in- quiry into many pertinent Greek docu- ments, a more complete knowledge of the stri Â¿ture and operation of early cults, and an understanding of the im- portance in them of anthropomorphic and other concepts. Serious students of early cults and myths will derive much stimulus and benefit from these pages. - Richard K. Morton Jacksonville, Fla.</page></plain_text>
