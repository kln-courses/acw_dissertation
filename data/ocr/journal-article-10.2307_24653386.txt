<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA I. KRSNA-GOVARDHAN IN BRAJ TRADITION The Govardhana legend may be viewed from several angles: as a lïïâ or caritra, i.e. as a particular episode in the Puranic narratives relative to the Cowherd god legend, the episode being usually known as govardhana-dharana, 'the lifting of the Govar dhana hill'; as the underlying myth which accounts for the all-Indian (though pre dominantly northern Indian) cult of mountain and cattle known as 'Govardhanapüjä' or the 'Annaküta' festival; as the 'historical' occurrence which was the cause for the manifestation of Srî GovardhanjI or Sri Nâthjï, as this mountain deity is known in the Braj area. The latter view is held by modern Krishnaite sects in general and particularly by the Vallabhite or pusti-sampradäya sect, a sect founded by Vallabha in Braj at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The sect holds its main deity Srî Nâthjï as the svarüpa, i.e. the 'own form' or 'essential form', of Sri Krsna Himself, who chose to manifest His divine nature under that Form in a miraculous manner on the Govardhan hill.2 Classical Indology mostly knows of the Govardhana legend through the Puranic accounts of the govardhana-dharana episode. The other aspects of the myth have not been much investigated, but for a few ethnographical papers dealing with some aspects of mountain and cattle festivals in India.3 As to the sectarian literature in Sanskrit (mostly on the GaudTya or Chaitanyite side) and in Braj (on the Vallabhite side), it has not been critically studied so far. The present article constitutes an attempt at sifting all the material available from various sources, literary and other wise, including the material yielded by fairly recent excavations in the Braj area. Some information was also collected by the author in the course of field-work conducted in the Braj area during the last years. The word govardhana has been interpreted by Growse as meaning 'a rearer of cattle' or 'a nurse of cattle',4 though its literal meaning is clearly 'an increaser of cattle'. The divinized hillock also known as Giriraj, 'King of hills', is conceived of as a benevolent deity primarily concerned with the fertility of the cows and the welfare of the cowherd folk. We know that this deity is worshipped all over northern India by the pastoral tribes, diversely known as Ahïras, Gwaläs or Gopas. The feast itself is known as govardhana-püjä or more frequently annaküta (Annaküt) as mentioned above, the word annaküta referring to 'mountain of food' offered to Krsna-Govardhan. The feast is also celebrated by a large number of non-pastoral Hindus, especially in the rural areas, on the day after Divâlï, i.e. on the first day of the bright half of the Indo-lranian Journal 22 (1980) 1-45. 0019-7246/80/0221-0001 $04.50.

The next day (Kärttika su. 2) is sacred to the river goddess Yamuna (the Jamna). Though very popular in Vaisnava homes all over India, the Annakut festival is not a Vaisnava festival, the pastoral folk themselves being primarily Saivite and Devi-worshippers. Besides, as we shall see, the feast assumes a markedly non-Brahmanical, primitive character, all the more so in the Braj context. Yet, in Vaisnava homes, it assumes a Krishnaite colour since Hindu tradition identifies Sri Giriräj with Krsna-Gopal, the Cowherd-god. The Annakut festival A description of the festival as it is celebrated in the Braj area will be useful here. For the villagers of Braj, the feast takes on even more importance than the Divflï festival itself. It is a very big affair in which the women of the household take the principal part.5 Preparations begin just after Dassera (dasahara) the day consecrated to Vijaya LaksmFon Asvin s'u. 10) and end on Divâlï day: they last twenty-one days in all. A lot of time is spent on the preparation of numerous delicacies to be offered to Srï Govardhan on the Annaküt day: traditionally, the offerings should consist of chappan bhog, i.e. fifty-six different items of food. The festival is celebrated in the inner courtyard of the house. On the ground women make an anthropomorphic representation of the deity Srï Govardhan Giriraj with cowdung. The body is figured by a large square with a conical head over it, two parallel feet under it and one or even two risen arms above it. On all the four sides of 'Sri Govardhan', small weeds and cotton balls represent the vegetation growing over the hill. On the top of its head a lighted lamp is placed. A big hole in the midst indicates its mouth (tunda, 'snout'), which is to be filled with food. Within the square representing the 'inside' of Govardhan, a number of smaller objects, also made of cow-dung, are placed: a model watchman (caukîdâr), a model dog, model cows, a pot to be filled with milk and some toys to entertain the young deity. Some miniature household implements are also displayed around (such as a churning-stick, a stove etc.). Gaurï and Ganes'a, as the two presiding deities, also moulded in cow-dung and suitably dressed, are placed as well. It is in front of that elaborate representation that the women place all the dishes they have prepared, filled with all sorts of cooked food plus a heap of food-grains: this display is known as Annaküt which, as we have seen, is now the name given to the festival itself. The pûjâ itself is to be performed in the evening. The presence of a Brahman priest is not required but there must be at least one cowherd by caste, together with at least one cow and one bull. The officiating cowherd recites a few set couplets extolling the holy mountain, Srï Giriraj, and then he fills the effigy's mouth with milk, khïr, purïs and sweetmeats. Then the cowherds and the cattle circumambulate the 'Govardhan', symbolically performing the parikramä of the holy hill, while ringing</page><page sequence="3">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA bells. The housewives wave lights and sing songs in honour of Sri GirirSj. All the people of the household worship the cattle and feed them and they make offerings to the cowherds. The ceremony ends as usual with a light-offering (ärati). Then the cattle are made to tread over the cow-dung display and trample it. The songs sung by women during the ceremony are known as hiro (i.e. abhïra songs), and they are interspersed with enthusiastic cries of SrT Giriräj Mahäräj kl jay\. Here is a sample of such songs: 'O Govardhan! You have come from the yonder side of the Gangä and you have fallen on this side of the Jamnâ6 And now you remain somehow on the way for one more day at the door of your female friends! O Govardhan! You are the greatest of all, none is greater than you For you were worshipped by Krsna himself: none knows your greatness!' According to S. K. Das,7 in Bihar and Bengal, the women sing obscene songs, pro bably because the rite is conceived as a fertility rite. This may also be the case in the Braj area. There are of course a number of other cattle-festivals in various parts of India, whether or not connected with the Annaküt festival, such as the Dang festival in Kanpur, the Poli festival in Berar, the Goraksanâth festival in Bengal, the Pongal festival in South India. The dates may differ from the date of the Annaküt. In most areas however cattle festivals are held on the first day of a lunar month or one of the full-moon days of the rainy season. A cattle festival is sometimes held on the Janmästami day,8 i.e. on the day commemorating the birth of Krsna-Gopäl, probably due to some kind of confusion with the Krishnaite festival of that name. Some aboriginal tribes of Chota-Nagpur, such as the Oraons, hold an important cattle festival known as 'Sohorai' which falls on the same day as the Annaküt. On that day they sacrifice a fowl to Gohär Deotä, the 'Cowherdgod', apparently without reference to Krsna. In the Oraon celebration, the character of the feast as a rite performed to ensure the fertility of human beings as well as cattle is strongly emphasized.9 The Cheros observe a similar festival on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of Srâvan, i.e. on the Näg-pancamI day, a day sacred all over India to snake-worship. S. K. Das writes that he cannot see any plausible reason for such a connection between cattle-rites and snake-worship.10 Yet it is clear that both cattle worship and snake-worship are ancient fertility rites, in which women play a very significant part. In the case of the Govardhana-püjä, the connection with snake worship appears very strong, as we shall try to show below. The essential features of the Govardhan cult as a cowherd festival therefore may be said to include three main features, (a) a cowdung anthropomorphic representation of the Govardhan hill; (b) the symbolic parikramä of the holy hill by cowherds and</page><page sequence="4">CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE cattle; (c) the display of huge amounts of cooked food to be consumed by the Cowherd-god (i.e. the divinized hill itself) and then by cowherds and cattle. The context is clearly not Vaisnava even though Krsna-Gopäl is mentioned in some of the accompanying songs, which is to be expected since the villagers of Braj strongly believe in the identity of the holy hill, Giriräj, with their divinized hero, the cowherd boy Krsna-Gopäl. The Puranic accounts of the Govardhana-dharana episode The Annaküt festival, with its primitive ritual, must be anterior to all the Puranic accounts of the Govardhana-dharana episode, since these accounts pre-suppose the existence of such a primitive cattle and mountain cult among the pastoral tribes of Braj. In the Harivamsa and the Visnu-puräna, Krsna-Gopäl exhorts his fellow-tribesmen, the Gopas, to give up the cult of the Vedic god Indra and to stick to their own religious tradition as cowherds by celebrating the 'autumnal festival' in honour of hills and cows: ... We are milkmen and we live in forests and hills. Hills, forests and cattle, these are our supreme benefactors.. . From hills we derive the greatest of benefits. We should therefore start sacrifices in honour of the hills. Let cows and bulls decorated with autumnal flowers go round yonder hill HV 59 Here the parikramä of the sacred hill by a procession of cattle and cowherds is clearly indicated as the essential ritual to be performed on that day. The corresponding passage of the Visnu-puräna (V. 10) is even more explicit about the nature of the cult proper to the nomadic pastoral tribes. Dämodara (Krsna) says: ... Where the land ceases to be cultivated there aie bounds assigned beyond which commences the forest; the forests are bound by hills and so far our limits extend. We are not shut in doors nor confined within walls; we have neither fields nor houses; we wander about happily wherever we list, travelling in our wagons. The spirits of these mountains, it is said, walk the woods in whatever form they will (kämampinah) or in their proper persons sport over their own precipices.11 If they should be displeased with those who inhabit the forests, then transformed into lions and beasts of prey, they will kill the offenders. We are bound to worship the mountains, to offer sacrifice to the cattle. What have we got to do with Indra? Cattle and mountains are our gods ... When the oblations have been presented and the Brahmans have been fed, let the Gopas circum ambulate the cows, decorated with garlands of autumnal flowers'. VP. V, 10, 32-35 [Wilson's translation] The Visnu-Puräna account throws some interesting light upon the way hill-spirits are supposed to behave in cowherd lore: not only do they change form at will (a capacity which they share with the Yaksas and some similar mythical beings), assuming frightening theriomorphic forms, but, in whichever form they have assumed, they themselves indulge in sport on the top of their own hills! This belief</page><page sequence="5">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA seems to account for the peculiar behaviour of Krsna-Gopäl himself, as narrated later in the same account: in VP V.10. 47, the Cowherd-god is said to duplicate himself, appearing on the top of the Govardhana hill, without leaving the other cowherds' company. Upon the summit of Govardhana, Krsna presented himself saying: 'I am the manifestation of the mountain (sailo'ham iti mürtimän) and he partook of much food presented by the Gopas; whilst in his own form as Krsna (svenaiva krsno rupena) he ascended the hill along with the cowherds and worshipped his other self . .. It is clear that, for the Brahmanical author of the Visnu-Puräna, the anthropomorphic form of Krsna is his essential form (svarüpa), even when he chooses to assume the form of the mountain he worships in order to partake of the food offerings; yet if the offerings are to the mountain, the mountain itself has to put on the semblance of a man or beast in order to consume the food offered to it. This passage is hardly understandable without reference to the primitive Annaküt ritual as described above. To the Puranic author, however, the old myth had to be presented somehow in Krishnaite terms, so that it is Krsna who takes over the part of the hill in the Puranic account, without ceasing to play his own part as leader of the Gopa tribe. The author of the Visnu-puräna also expresses the consideration due to Brâhmans in showing them being fed first, even before the circumambulation of the hill takes place. Nevertheless he does not omit to mention the blood sacrifice that the cow herd folk are wont to offer to their mountain god. This blood offering, as we have seen, is still present in the cult of the Cowherd-god as practiced by the Oraon aboriginals of Chota-Nagpur, which falls precisely on the same day as the Annaküt festival. But this blood sacrifice to mount Govardhan is no longer mentioned in the Bhägavata-puräna, a definitely later text, as it must have hurt the sensibilities of mediaeval Vaisnavas. It is only in the Bhägavata-puräna story that Krsna is said to have 'plucked the mountain as a child plucks a flower' - so to speak from outside. The Harivamsa account, definitely more archaic in character, suggests that Krsna, as the hill deity, manifests himself from within or from underneath the mountain. When Krsna lifted the mountain: 'Underneath it the caves became like large halls and it looked as if the hill, which was covered with blue clouds, was a canopy resting on a pole'. Here the canopy represents the vault of the sky covered with clouds (which are of the very colour of Krsna's body); the hero's feet stand firmly on the underground and his whole standing body with the uplifted arm appears as a kind of 'pole' connecting the three worlds.12</page><page sequence="6">CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE Sri Govardhannathfl: aNäga deity? Ancient representations of the govardhanadharana episode, especially the earliest specimens found in the Mathurä Museum (belonging to the Gupta period) are con sistent with the Harivams'a account, in so far as Krsna-Gopäl is represented as mani festing himself from within the mountain whose hollow centre he occupies. The popular cow-dung images, as described above, suggest the same. Growse13 remarks that the Govardhan hill is usually represented as an isolated conical peak which is 'unlike reality' since the hill is actually shaped as a long irregular stony ridge. But Growse's remarks apply only to fairly recent representations as found in miniature paintings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In ancient Mathurä icono graphy, the elongated shape of the hill is characteristically depicted as a kind of broken line figuring five identical conical peaks. Moreover, no ancient representation of the govardhanadharana episode shows Krsna in a dancing pose, balancing the hill on a single finger: on the contrary, the hero's feet are firmly pressed on the ground whilst the top of the hill rests on his upturned palm. The cows and trees are disposed all along the two slopes of the mountain whose centre appears as a kind of hollow cave occupied by Krsna's huge body. These characteristics of ancient Mathurä iconography are preserved in the popular icons of 'Sri Govardhannäthjf or 'Sri Näthjf, which are worshipped by the Vallabhite sect as the svarüpa or 'essential Form' of Krsna govardhanadhara and which remain the main deity of Braj up to this day. The three characteristic features which distinguish the 'Sri Näthjf' image from all similar images of Krsna-Gopäl worshipped by the Vallabhites and other sectarian and non-sectarian northern Vaisnavas (such as the Dvärkädhls' of Dvärkä and Mathurä and the Ranchodjlof Dakore14 are: (a) the delineation of a mountain cave around Krsna's body; (b) the upturned left palm of the god with five fingers pressed together emerging from the cave ; (c) the three lotus stalks held in the god's bent right arm, whose hand rests on his hip. According to the Vallabhite tradition especially as recorded in the Srïnâthjï kl präkatya värtä, 'Account of the manifestation of Sri Näthjl' (in Braj prose),15 it was the 'risen arm' of Sri Näthjrwhich first became visible on the holy hill and this miracle took place on a Näg PancamI day. For a long time - up to the time of Vallabha's own avatära on earth - the 'Risen Arm' (or palm) was worshipped by the 'Brajvâsïs', the inhabitants of the Braj area, with offerings of milk poured over it and a melä used to be held in its honour on Näg PancamI day. According to the said värtä, the subsequent manifestation of the 'glorious Mouth' - literally 'lotus-mouth' (mukhärvinda) - of the same deity raised new problems as to its proper feeding. The newly-found idol was finally identified by the Vaisnava reformer, Vallabhäcarya himself, as a svarüpa of Sri Krsna, identical with Sri Näthjl. Accordingly, Vallabha set about the task of establishing the cult or 'service' (sevä) of Sri Näthjl on the Govardhan hill, on the spot where the 'glorious mouth' of the deity had appeared.</page><page sequence="7">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA In a previous paper, we have already referred to the extraordinary importance assumed by the Näga cult in the whole Braj area, as revealed by typonymy as well as by local beliefs and traditions.16 The recent excavations at Sonkh, seven miles SSE of Mathurä, have yielded a wealth of iconographie material which bears witness to the prevalence of snake-worship in the area from the early Kusäna period.17 Among the images found in the oldest Näga temple at Sonkh (belonging to the Kusäna period), we notice a Näga deity in abhayamudra and a door-relief showing a Näga climbing a rocky mountain. A medallion on a pillar depicts a Näga having a human shape in the upper part of its body and carrying three lotus stalks in his uplifted right hand. Another fragment shows a Näga with human-shaped legs and a snake upper-body, from which again arms are sticking out. The analogies of these ancient images with the Sri Nâthjî icon are rather striking. These analogies suggest that the latter might be interpreted as a fully anthropomorphic version of an older half-anthropomorphic Näga deity. This hypothesis finds support in some local traditions mentioned in a previous paper, concerning the belief in giant subterranean Nägas whose head and tails are wont to emerge here and there.18 The toponymy of the area is also instructive. According to local tradition, the village of Paithä (lit. 'Entrance'), situated a short distance away from the south-west border of the Govardhan hill, marks the place where Krsna entered the hill in order to lift it from below. At the southern extremity of the hill, near the Räjasthänl border, stands the locality known as Puchri, 'the Tail'. The villagers' belief is that Sri Giriräj, under the form of a cow (or a bull? go svartipa), has its head inside the Mânasï Gangä and its tail at Puchri. This belief suggests another possible theriomorphic manifestation of the spirit of the Govardhan hill, whose very name, 'Increaser of cattle', would readily fit a bull.19 Interestingly, a similar idea about the shape assumed by the Govardhan hill spirit is found in a mediaeval Mahänubhäva work in old Marâthî, the Sfïkrsnacaritra of Maibhatta (1280 A.D.). Upon a question asked by his female disciple MahädaTsä, the Master Cakradhara (who, according to the belief held in the Mahänubhäva sect, is said to be identical with Srï Krsna) declares that, upon Krsna's order, all the Gopälas worshipped the Govardhan hill - yet their püjä remained abhäva ('nullified' or 'fruit less'). Therefore Srï Krsna Himself came out of the mountain under the form of a bull and ate up the offerings.20 The obvious implication of the story is that Sri Krsna himself, under his mountain form, could not consume the offerings for want of a mouth, and so, in order to please the Gopas and make their sacrifice fruitful, he took the shape of a bull. In this account, the coalescence of mountain and cattle worship in the govardhana-püjä rites is strikingly expressed. Near the village of 'Puchri', a small shrine known as Puchri kau lauthä contains a rather indistinct low-relief image painted in sindhür (red-lead) like the representations of the monkey-god Hanumän. The godling is said to be a 'Gopa companion' or 'a</page><page sequence="8">CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE Guardian' (pahalvän) of Krsna-Govardhan. The word lauthä means a stone (or part of a brick) tied with a long rope to a bamboo stick, which is used by cowherd boys to strike the cattle from behind and make them run forward. If our interpretation is correct, the shrine in question marks the place where the cowherd Guardian of the 'Cow' or 'Bull' Govardhan is standing.21 Occasional references to mount Govardhan assuming the shape of a cow or bull do not preclude the ancient belief in the presence of a huge Näga within the hill. A comparison between the hill itself and an ant-hill - always supposed to be the abode of a snake — is found in a late (interpolated) passage of the Mahäbhärata (II. 41): '0 Bhïsma, what is remarkable in that one [Krsna] having lifted the mount Govar dhana, which is but like an ant-hill?' The word Puchrl may refer to the tail of a cow or of a snake. Whoever has watched an Indian cow grazing cannot but have noticed the resemblance of its long, smooth, shiny, continually moving and lashing tail with a writhing snake. The prevailing local belief seems to have been that the Nägaräja underlying Govardhan had its head ('mouth') at the Mänasi Gangä and its tail at Puchrï. In Indian lore, the hooded head of a Näga never seems to emerge from dry earth, but only from some pond, well or lake filled with water. This is the case with the 'MänasT Gangä', a large tank built within the present village of Govardhan and the most revered spot in the whole of the Braj area. The village which has been built around the pond lies in a shallow depression which divides the longer, southern part of the hill from its shorter northern part. The pond, which holds water all round the year, is an artificial one, made by damming a seasonal nullah. It is likely that the original 'Mânasî Gangä' was a mere pool in the bed of the nullah. The water which fills the Mänasi Gangä after the rains is supposed to be 'milky' water like that of the Gangä itself. An important religious fair (melä) is held there at the time of the Annaküt festival on the day after Divâlï. Another takes place on the full-moon day of the month of Â§âdha, the first month of the rainy season, a day locally known as Mundiyo pümimä, 'the Pürnimä of the shaven ascetics' (Jainas?). The name of the pond raises a problem. Some local pandits explain it by saying that the pond itself was born of the mind (manas) of Krsna himself. Others connect it with Räjä Man Singh of Jaipur, who built concrete banks around the pond in the seventeenth century.22 It appears much more likely however that the 'Mänas! Gangä' owes its name to the snake-goddess, Manas! Devi, whose temple rises on high ground above its bank. According to P. D. Mital,23 Manasä Devf is the great 'Lok-Devf of Braj, i.e. the protector-goddess of the Braj ksetra and of all its inhabitants, the Brajvâsïs. The most revered objects on the spot are two rectangular standing slabs of stone immersed within the pond itself. After the end of the rains, at the time of the autum nal festival, the smaller one is only half immersed and its upper part becomes visible above the water. There pilgrims flock to worship Krsna under the name of 'Girirâjjï</page><page sequence="9">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA ke mukhärvincT, literally 'the lotus-like Mouth (of Face?) of Giriräj'. The temple built above that holy spot, known as the 'Haridev temple', is the most important in the area. It was built in 1637 and is also known as Sri Giriräj mahäräj mukhärvind mukut, 'the Crown over the lotus-like Mouth [or Face] of Sri Giriräj'.24 It is in the Mânasï Gangä that the pilgrims must take a dip before starting on the parikramä of Srï Giriraj, a circumambulation usually performed from the month of Äsädha onwards. The merits acquired by this parikramä are believed to be very great and there is little doubt that the Ban yäträ or circumambulation of all the holy spots of the Braj area, later established under the influence of the Vallabhite and Gaudlya sects, derives from that famous, long-established parikramä of Sri Giriraj.25 If the spirit of the Govardhan hill was originally conceived as a Nâga deity — or at least as a spirit occasionally taking the shape of a giant Nâga, as suggested by the evidence of local traditions and beliefs — we may venture to investigate further as to its identity. Among the well-known 'Nägaräjas' mentioned in Puranic lore, the one who seems to qualify best for the role is undoubtedly Vâsuki, usually mentioned together with Sesa and Taksaka as one of the three great Nâgas. In the ßhägavata-Puräna, Vâsuki is sometimes identified with Visnu-Hari himself.26 In the Brahmända-Puräna, Vâsuki appears as the Milkman of the Nâgas, engaged in milking the earth27 (which would account for the 'milky water' in the Mânasï Gangä). His well-known role in the Churning of the Ocean legend, where he plays the part of the churning rope, also underlies his connection with the activities of milkmen and milkmaids. Moreover his very name Vâsuki, literally 'the Indweller', seems to fit in well with the Govardhana dharana story. The name also recalls the ancient name of Krsna as Vasudeva, the 'Indwelling god'.28 Closely associated with the Govardhan cult is the Yamunâ river, which plays such a role in cowherd lore, and whose feast known as Yama-dvitlya, on Kârttika su. 2, immediately follows the Govardhana-püjä or Annaküt festival. Together with the püjä to the MänasI Gangä and the dariana of god Haridev, bathing in the Yamuna river is one of the main rituals to be performed by pilgrims at the time of the Divälf festival. The association between Ksrna and the Yamuna river is so close that the former is often represented in local imagery as Sri Yamunäjr, under a female form. Popular Vallabhite representations of the 'Three Treasures' {tin nidhi) of Braj include the Govardhan hill (enclosing in its inner hollow cave the image of Sri Govardhannâthjf) with Sri Yamunâjï on its right and Äcärya Mahäprabhu (Valla bhäcärya) on its left; the river Jamna itself is depicted flowing at the foot of the sacred hill, covered with blossoming lotuses. The inclusion of the Yamuna river within the holy ksetra of Sri Girirfj is not merely a mythological invention. It is known that, in early times, the main channel of the river Yamunä flowed far to the west of its present channel; it was then very near the eastern border of the Govardhan ridge. This tradition is confirmed by local</page><page sequence="10">10 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE toponymy such as the name of the village Jamunavatau, situated half a mile East of Govardhan. Puranic accounts of the filäs performed by Krsna-Gopäl in the area also imply this proximity. The account found in Bhägavata-puräna itself suggests that the Govardhan hill was situated within the Vrndävan area and that the river Yamuna did flow near-by.29 The Kaliyadamana episode, which takes place in the Yamuna river itself, belongs to the same group of episodes as the Govardhanadharana though it appears a little later in iconography.30 In this episode, the Cowherd-god overpowers the treacherous Näga Käliya who is said to have unduly taken his residence in a pool within the river bed. Lurking at its bottom, Käliya defiles the Yamunä (also known as 'Kâlindï') and poisons its waters. In crushing the pride of Käliya by trampling his hoods under his dancing feet, Krsna-Gopäl fulfils his duty as the Protector of the sacred ksetra of Braj, while asserting his own right over the holy river. Krsna, nevertheless, does not kill the villainous Nâga - as he does all the other demoniac beings which infest the woods of Vraja: he merely humbles him and sends him away where he belongs. In Indian lore, the cobras are considered born dancers and 'snake-dances' are frequently performed by villagers, especially among aboriginals. The image of Krsna dancing on the hoods of Käliya seems to be the oldest representation of a dancing Krsna. In the oldest representations of the Kâliya-damana episode, Krsna is depicted dancing on the hood of the vanquished Nâga whose straightened tail he holds in this left hand. According to the Apabhrams'a poet Svayambhü, however, it is not the tail of Käliya but its hood that Krsna held in this hand. In the Ritthanemicariü, Svayambhü says: There were five fingers with five shining nails and his hand was looking as a snake-hood decorated with jewels: With his hand, he took hold of the serpent's hoods and at that moment one could not distinguish which was the snake and which was the hand of Krsna!'31 The Govardhanadharana and the Käliyadamana episodes, which seem to belong to the very core of the Cowherd-god legend show some parallelism: in both episodes, Krsna apparently acts alone, independently from Balaräma, though the latter is usually associated with him in his pastoral activities and in his fights with the demons of the woods. In the former episode, Krsna manifests himself emerging from a cave within the Govardhan hill; in the latter he emerges from within the waters of the Yamuna river. The two feasts, that of the Govardhan hill and that of the Yamunâ river, are celebrated one after another during the two days following Divälf. In both stories the god's anthropomorphic shape assumes cosmic dimensions: zs.govard.hana dhara, Krsna emerges from below the mountain to humble the ruler of the sky, Indra, and drive away the monsoon clouds; as käliyadamana, he emerges from under the waters of the Yamuna to humble the ruler of the netherworld, here represented by</page><page sequence="11">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 11 the Näga Käliya. It may be that the two episodes reveal two aspects of the same myth relating to Vâsudeva, 'He who pervades all', since they depict Krsna as the Controller of the three worlds. This characteristic would explain a rather obscure passage in the Mahabhärata (XII. 328:39) where the Vaisnava name Dâmodara32 is explained by Krsna himself in these terms: 'Eager to achieve success through the control of the senses, beings try to reach me, who am the heaven and the earth and the firmament between'. The govardhanadharana and kaliyadamana episodes reveal an underlying belief in Krsna as the 'Snatcher' of the three worlds, which he encompasses and pervades. A similar belief underlies the Trivikrama legend, in which god Visnu, in the form of a dwarf (vämana), snatches the control of the three worlds from the Asura king, Bali. We suggest there may be a close relationship between the Govardhana and the Trivikrama episodes: it is probably not by chance that the Govardhana-püjä or Annaküt festival is also sacred to Bali in the Hindu calendar. Some ancient represen tations of Trivikrama Visnu show the deity's right foot planted within some kind of cave, while his uplifted arm, with palm upturned, seems to support the ceiling of the cave,33 a posture which resembles that of Sri Näthjr. There is an analogy between the concept of the Cowherd-god as a child or young boy and that of Visnu as a dwarf. Moroever, it should be noted that, if we put aside the Räma-avatära (a clear case of late divinization of a human hero), the Vämana-avatära together with the Krsna-avatära constitute the only two fully anthropomorphic manifestations of god Visnu and that both are suggestive of the god's all-pervasiveness as well as of his boyish playfulness. Whatever may be said or supposed oi its Vaisnava connections and later Vaisnava interpretations, the cult of the Govardhan hill, as seen from Braj itself, reveals a non-Vaisnava background. The spirit of the 'Cattle-increaser' hillock, deemed identical with Krsna-Gopäl, chooses to manifest itself under the form of a risen arm or palm resembling a cobra hood, and it may be conceived also as a bull or cow. In the village of Govardhan and in other villages around the hill, Sri Giriräj is often wor shipped in the shape of a mere pointed rock, covered with yellow garments and wear ing a garland of wild flowers (vanamâlâ). A stone from the Govardhan hill, known as govardhana-silä 'Govardhan rock' or 'hill', is often tied by a devotee round his neck: it symbolizes for him the presence of Krsna-Govardhan. It it known that Caitanya himself used to wear such a stone round his neck: there is little doubt that for him, the mystic who saw Krsna-Gopâl as pervading the whole world, the govardhana-silä, a chip from the sacred Govardhan hill, was the very body of Lord Krsna.34 In some legends popular in northern and central India, the Govardhan hill itself is credited with a remarkable mobility: it appears as a kind of faithful companion to Krsna Himself, following Him everywhere, together with his cows, his Gopa companions and his flute!35</page><page sequence="12">12 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE Whereas the disciples of Caitanya continue to pay respect to Sri Govardhan as a concrete manifestation of Krsna-Gopäl, whereas the disciples of Vallabha worship the idol of Sri Govardhannäthjl or Sri NäthjF (which their founder Vallabha is supposed to have extracted from the holy mountain) and keep nursing and feeding him — away from Govardhan — as they would a living child, the villagers of Braj, up to this day, continue to worship the hill itself as they have always done, by circum ambulating it, by flocking to the MänasI Gangä at the time of the autumnal festival and by offering the püjä to their 'cow-dung Srf Giriräj' and to their cattle within the courtyards of their homes. Though nominally Vaisnava, the pastoral people of Braj never had a share in official Vaisnava rituals.36 Today, as in the days of yore, they remain mountain and cattle worshippers. To them, Govardhan is Krsna and Kj-sna is Govardhan. Their simple devotion still finds its expression in their favorite cry: SrT GiriräjMahäräj kl jay\ NOTES 1 The present paper refers to two previously published articles: 'The Cowherd-god in Ancient India' [CGA1] published in Pastoralists and Nomads in South Asia, Südasien Intitut, Heidelberg, 1975, and 'Braj lost and found' [BLF] published in the Indo-lranian Journal 18 (1976), p. 195. 1 For a sectarian account of 'The Manifestation of Sri Näthji' see part II, pp. 15-35. 3 Buddha Prakash, 'Govardhana püjä', The Poona Orientalist, 18 (1953), p. 13; 'Krsna, an Ethnological Study', in P.

According to some, it was actually a boulder chopped by Hanumän him self as he was carrying hills to build the dam over the ocean (setubandha). According to local belief, the hill used to be an impressive one - but due to the perversity of mankind, its height kept decreasing during the whole of 'Kali Yuga* and is still decreasing. 7 op. cit. p. 232. 8 The Janmâstamî festival is celebrated on the eighth day of the dark fortnight of the month of Bhädra (of Srävana in the Southern Calendar) which marks the peak of the rainy season. This festival, of much later origin than the Annaküt, is very popular today all over India. ' As shown by the account given in S. K. Das, op. cit., p. 236. 10 'It is very difficult to say how the word Näg-Pancami became associated with the cattle-rite. It is undoubtedly a Brahmanical rite which was most probably borrowed by the Cheros and they must have named the cattle festival after it without realizing its significance' (ibid., p. 238). We do not accept S. K. Das's hypothesis. 11 The 2d line of v. 34 reads: tattadrüpam samästhäya ramante svesu sânusu which Wilson has translated 'or in their proper persons, sport over their own precipices' (The Visnu-purâna, p. 418), quoted above. Since each hill is conceived as having its own divine spirit or deity, the line must mean: 'these hill-spirits are wont to manifest themselves on top of their</page><page sequence="13">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 13 own hills under whatever form they choose to assume'. This evidently includes the possibility of assuming an anthropomorphic appearance, such as the form of the Cowherd-god, Krsna-Gopäl, in the Puranic accounts. 12 About the significance of Krsna's attitude, see pp. 10-11. 13 Mathura, p. 169. 14 These two famous idols are both caturbhuja, 'four-armed' icons of Visnu-Krsna. Both are supposed to be originally one and the same svarupa ('own form') of Visnu-Krsna. The Ranchodji of Dakore, however, is also known as 'Ranchod Trikama' (Trivikrama, cf. p. 11). 15 Part of this Varta is translated and analyzed in Part II. 16 Cf. BLFp. 195. 17 See H. Härte, A Kusana Nâga temple at Sonkh, Mathura Museum Centenary Number, July December 1973. 18 Cf. BLF, pp. 208-208. It must be kept in mind however that popular belief in the existence of giant subterranean Nägas is not confined to the Braj area; a similar belief is held about the 'Sesäcalam' and Nallamalai hills in Andhra (cf. BLF p. 209). These hills, also known as 'Venkatâcalam', are the very group of hills to which the Vaisnava shrine of Tirupati belongs. The seven peaks of Sesäcalam are said to represent the seven hoods of Lord Adisesa, the Serpent King. According to local beliefs, the Narasimha shrine at Ahobalam represents the centre of Adisesa, the famous Saiva shrine of Sri Sailam its tail end, whereas Tirupati, the abode of Lord Venkatesvara (Visnu) stands at the back of its head. According to another interpretation the hills represent the body of Adisesa on which Lord Venkatesvara dances. This in turn reminds us of the dance of Krsna-Gopäl on the hoods of the Nâga Käliya. The probability of some interference between the two legends, that of Krsna-Govardhan of Braj and that of Venkatesvara of Tirupati, would deserve further investigation. It may be that in both cases a Vaisnava cult has been grafted on an older Nâga cult, the Vaisnava deity being sometimes identified with the resident Näga and sometimes represented as having gained the better of it. 15 According to Seth Govinddäs, Braj nur Braj-yäträ, Delhi, 1959, pp. 150-151, local people nowadays say that Sri Girirâj is shaped as a cow whose mouth is located at Râdhâkund (at the northern extremity of the hill) and whose tail reaches Puchri. 20 Maibhattakrta Srikrsnacaritra, ed. by S. G. Tulpule, Poona, 1973, lila n° 14, p. 31. 21 See supra p. 3 about the so-called caukidàr and his dog made of cowdung, represented at the feet of the 'Govardhan' image set up for the Annaküt festival. 22 The present Haridev temple was built in 1637 AD. by the Räjä of Ajmer (Jaipur), Bhagavändäs, Män Singh, built the concrete bank around the pond and the village grew around it. 23 BSI, p. 109. 24 Unexpectedly, the idol now enshrined in the Haridev temple is a Laksml-Näräyana idol. The original (svarüpa) image of Sri Näthji,, which is the property of the eldest branch of the des cendants of Vallabha, is now enshrined at Näthvära in Mewar (Räjasthän) where it was taken and hidden during the persecution led by emperor Aurangzeb. The MänasTGangä mukhärvind in the Govardhan village seems to be a secundary location: the primitive mukhärvind is a simple crack in the rock, still worshipped at Jatipura (old Gopälpur), South-East of the Govardhan hill, opposite Anyaur. According to the Vallabhite tradition, it is out of that crack in the rock that Sri Govardhannâthjï manifested Himself to Saddupände, as narrated in the SNPV; cf. GNIII, Trans. §§3-4 and GNI III, note 7. 25 The circumambulation of Sri Girirâj which is usually performed privately by devotees especially during the month of Äsädha, the first month of the rains, is supposed to earn them extraordinary merits and blessings. While performing the parikramâ, on the footbath which circles the hill, the pilgrims are advised to let some milk trickle down all the way as an offering to the mountain deity. Some even perform what is known as a dandavat'i parikrarrm, progressing slowly and painfully for days on end by an endless succession of prostrations. 26 Bhâg. P. VII. 7.11 and XI. 16.18: 'Among the Nägas, I am Väsuki'.</page><page sequence="14">14 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE " Brah. P. II. 17.34; 20.41; 36.213. 28 The larger slab of stone placed by the side of the 'lotus-mouth' of Sri Girirâj (identified with Krsna-Väsudeva), probably represents his elder brother Balaräma or Sankarsana, an ancient Näga deity also connected with the Braj ksetra. Though, in the Puranic accounts, Balaràma has no connection with the Govardhana hill, in Mathurä ancient (Kusäna) iconography, he somewhat resembles Väsudeva-Krsna. He too wears a vanamälä and in one icon at least he is represented with his (left) hand risen over his head in front of his own Näga canopy; cf. V. S. Agarwal, Indian Art I, pi. XLVII fig. 156. 29 As pointed out by P. D. Mitai (BSI p. 130), in the Bhagavata-Purana, when Akrüra, on Kamsa's order, leaves Mathurâ on his chariot to fetch Krsna and Baladeva from Vrndâvana, his journey is said to last the whole day, so that the Vrndâvana of that time could not have been as near to Mathurâ as it is today. According to local traditions, the holy spot known as Candrasarovar near Parasauli village, one mile North-East of Govardhan, was 'the ancient Vrndäban', i.e. the original spot where the famous rasa dance of Krsna with the Gopis took place (ibid. pp. 106, 109, 110). The present day Vrndäban is supposed to have been 'lost' together with all the lilä sthalas of Braj for a number of centuries before it was rediscovered by the disciples of Caitanya in the early sixteenth century A.D. (cf. BLF p. 199). This 'rediscovered' Vrndäban is situated on the bank of the Jamna as it flows today, about fourteen miles away from Govardhan. 30 Cf.CGAIpp. 96-97. 31 Ritthanemi Cariü, sandh. 6, kadavaka 3, in Apabhrams'a sâhitya mâm krsna-kàvya [Gujaräti], a paper included in Anusandhan by H. S. Bhayani, Sarasvati Pustak Bhandar, Ahmedabad. This comparison strikingly suggests the primitive cult of the 'Risen Arm' of Sri Krsna, which, accord ing to the Sri Nathpt pràkatya kl vârtâ (cf. supra n. 2) preceded the cult of 'Sri Näthj? on the Govardhan hill. 32 About the name 'Dâmodara', cf. CGAI, pp. 109-112. 33 See Gopinath Rao, Elements of Hindu Iconography, vol. I, pp. 161 f. Though the Vâmana image is a two-handed one, according to the Vaikhânasagama, Visnu-Krsna as Trivikrama may have four or eight arms; he should be dark as the rain-cloud, clothed in red garments and decorated with ornaments. Behind him is a tree called kalpaka and Indra should be shown holding an umbrella over his head (a detail which seems to underline Indra's inferior position as subject to Visnu). In the Varäha-puräna, it is said that when the foot of Trivikrama was lifted up to measure the heaven, the Brahmanda (universal egg) burst open and cosmic waters began to pour down through the clefts of the broken Brahmanda. Trivikrama is so represented in an eighth century relief found in Raipur Dt, (Gopinath Rao, ibid. pl. XLVIII): in this image, the lifted left hand is actually higher than the lifted leg of Trivikrama, its palm is upturned and seems to lean against the ceiling of the cave. This is also the case with the eight-handed Trivikrama represented on a panel stone at Mämallipuram (ibid., pl. XLIX). 34 Cf. A K. Majumdar, Caitanya, his life and doctrine, Bombay, 1969, p. 129; S. K. De, VFMB, p. 121. The Caitanya caritamrta, Antya-tîlà VI, w. 281 ff, narrates how Caitanya entrusted his Käyastha (therefore Südra) disciple Raghunätha-däsa with his govardhana-silä. It is said that the Master him self had an ardent devotion to this sacred stone, which he viewed as Krsna's own body (krsna kalevara) and which he used to wet with his tears. Caitanya enjoined his disciple constantly to worship the govardhana-silä by offering sättvika püjä to it (a mode of worship which entails solely the offering of water and Tulasl leaves and does not require the ritual capacity of a Brahman). Moreover it is said in the CC that Raghunätha-däsa used to contemplate 'Brajendranäth', i.e. Lord Krsna Himself in the stone. From this testimony, it appears that the Gaudïya Vaisnavas, at least fjom the time of Caitanya, conceived the Govardhana-s'ilä as an essential Foitn (svanipa) of Sri Krsna Himself. The aniconic Govardhana stone was to the iconic forms of Krsna-Gopäl (such as Sri Govardhannäthji, Sri Gopinäthji and the like) what the saligrâma stone was to iconic forms of Visnu Caturbhuja. It is probably from this primitive stone-worship within the Vaisnava tradition (similar to the linga-stone worship within the Saiva tradition) that the medieval cult of the svarïipa idols of Krsna-Gopäl originated. (We are</page><page sequence="15">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 15 grateful to Srivatsa Goswâmi of Vrndâban foi supplying the information that the Rädhä-Raman icon of the Rädhä-Raman temple in Vrndäban was made out of iatigram stone). 35 Such a belief is current in Maharashtra according to Kincaid, History of the Maratha people, Bombay, p. 103. The flute appears closely connected with Krsna-Gopäl in iconography at least from the 12th century A.D., as shown by the representation of muraltdhara Krsna in the Chennakes'ava temple at Belur. In medieval iconography, the flute tends to be treated as an essential attribute of Krsna-Gopäl's divine personality, taking the place of the four ayudhas attributed to Visnu Caturbhuja. As it is the case with the cakra and sankha attributes of Visnu, the flute tends to be personalized in Krishnaite literature (see the imprecations of the jealous Go pi s against 'Muralî' in the Bhramar-gît of Sûr-dâs). 36 That the 'Brajväsis', i.e. the pastoral population of Braj, even when won over to some form of Krishnaism, were not given a share in the ritual 'service' (sevâ) of Sri Govardhannäthji can be inferred from the sectarian account contained in the Sri Nâthjt prakatya k~i varta (cf. Pt II n. 63). It is only in the sphere of the singing of the praise of the deity (kirtana) that the Brajväsis took the lead, with Kumbhandäs, the nephew of a cattle-owner from Jamanavätau, who had been claimed by Sri Näthji himself as his favourite 'playmate' (cf. GNIII §7 and n. 36). II. THE MANIFESTATION OF SRI GOVARDHANNÄTHJÏ IN THE VALLABHITE TRADITION The värtä literature in Braj Bhäsä The texts known as värtäs are the chronicles of the Vallabhite or Pusti-sampradaya sect, composed in simple Braj prose by some of Vallabhäcärya's descendants during the seventeenth and eighteenth century A.D.1 The word värtä or värttä means an 'account' of some past events. The Vallabhite Värtäs are edifying tales composed about some religious events or some exemplary characters, such as the great devotees and saints who were adepts of the Pusti-sampradäya faith. The main bulk of Värtä literature, therefore, is of a hagiographical character. From the point of view of the genre, the Vallabhite Värtäs may be viewed as some kind of dharma-kathäs or dharma-gäthäs, such as are found in Buddhist and Jaina literature. From a philological point of view, the Värtäs in archaic Braj, after the khyät or bat in Old Räjasthäm,2 constitute important monuments of early prose in the Indo Aryan vernaculars. The close relationship of Braj Bhäsä with the other major Western Hindi dialect, Khar! Boll, on which standard modern Hindi is based, made these works easily accessible to the Hindi readers, so that the Vallabhite Värtäs provided ready models for the Khar! Boll prose writers of the nineteenth century, such as the author of the Prem Sâgar, Lallu Lâljî, whose language appears still coloured by his Braj Bhäsä models. The oldest and most important composition in the Värtä style is the CauräsT Vaisnavan kl värtä, 'Account of the eighty-four Vaisnavas', dealing with the biographies (each of which is called a Värtä) of the eighty-four devotees supposed to have been converted to the Pusti-märga faith by Vallabhäcärya, the founder of the sect (A.D.</page><page sequence="16">16 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE 1478—1530) himself. Another well-known work of the same type is the Do sau vaisnavan kî värtä, 'Account of the two hundred and fifty-two Vaisnavas', which gives the biographies of the next generation of Vallabhite devotees, who were the disciples or contemporaries of Vallabha's second son and successor, Vitthalnäth, known in the sect as 'Sri Güsäinjl', the third Àcârya of the Pusti-sampradäya (A.D. 1515-1564). Both these works are attributed to s&gt;ri Hanrayji (A.D. 15VU--1 /15), a great scholar, who wrote a number of treatises in Sanskrit and in Braj prose - even in Gujarat!".3 Hariräy was the great grandson of Güsäin Vitthalnäth and he revered as his 'Guru' his uncle Gokulnâth, Vitthalnäth's fourth son, who wrote down the teachings of his illustrious father in Sanskrit verse as well as in Braj prose in works known as Vacanämrtas, the 'Ambrosial Words' (of Vitthalnäth). The Vacanämrtas of Gokulnâth are the source of the Cauräsl as well as the Do sau vaisnavan ki vârtâ, as shown by H. Tandon.4 Besides, in the Twenty-four Vacanâmrtâ Gokulnâth is said to reveal to his own disciple, Kalyänbhatt, the doctrines he had himself received from Vitthalnäth, concerning the religious and moral ideals of the 'Vaisnavas', i.e. the followers of the Pustimärga. The whole of Vârtâ literature in Braj Bhäsä there fore appears based on oral tradition, mostly transmitted to Hariräy by his uncle Gokulnâth, a tradition going back to 'Güsäin Vitthalnäth': it is a well-known fact that it is to Vitthalnäth that the sect founded by Vallabhäcärya owes its present body of doctrines as well as its rituals and organization. Apart from the two Värtäs mentioned above, a number of other works in Braj prose are attributed to the prolific Hariräy: the Nifa vârtâ, Gharü vârtâ, Bhâvasindhu, Sm Nâthjï prâkatya kï vârtâ and Sri Mahâprabhu prâkatya kî vârtâ. From the point of view of the history of the sect, the most important work appears to be the Sri Nâthjï prâkatya kî vârtâ [SNPV], which deals with the origins of the cult of Sri Nâthjï: the miraculous manifestation of Krsna Govardhanadhara under his 'Own Form' or 'Essential Form' as Sri Govardhannâthjï or Sri Nâthjï out of the Govardhan hill, the discovery of the 'Risen Arm' by the local inhabitants, the 'Brajvâsïs', the recognition of the idol and its enthronement by Sri Âcârya Mahâprabhu, i.e. Valla bhäcärya himself, who, in the Pusti-märga sect, is held to be himself another divine manifestation of the same Krsna-Gopäl. Besides the story of the first manifestation of Sri Nâthjï on the holy hill - an event that the SNPV dates S. 1466 [A.D. 1409] - the work relates with interesting details the development of the cult of Sri Nâthjï, first as a local deity worshipped by the Brajväsls, and then, after the intervention of Vallabhâcarya, as a svarüpa, i.e. an 'Essential Form' of Krsna-Gopâl, attracting pilgrims and devotees from far and wide. The cult of Sri Nâthjï develops further under the vigorous leadership of Vitthalnäth and that of his two immediate successors, Sri Giridhaijï and Srï Dâmodarjï. The latter was only fifteen years old at the time of the violent persecution unleashed by</page><page sequence="17">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 17 the emperor Aurangzeb, a persecution which brought about the destruction of most of the Mathura shrines (including the famous Kes'avdev temple) and which forced the successors of Vallabha, who owned the original svarûpa image of Srï Nâthjï (and some others, also considered as svarüpas) to flee from Govardhan and Gokul, taking their idols with them to safe custody. The Värtä narrates the wanderings of Srï Nâthjï and his keepers and their final establishment in the kingdom of Mewar (Rajasthan) in S. 1728 [A.D. 1671 ], where a temple was built at a secluded place in the Aravalli hills, later known as 'Näthdvärä'. The first part of the SNPV (corresponding to §§ 1-16 in our edition) deals with the Manifestation of 'Srï Nâthjï' and the first establishment of his cult by Vallabhäcärya; the following paragraphs (§§ 17-22) add a few edifying episodes illustrating the development of the new cult in the Braj area in the years immediately following Vallabha's departure. A few years later, in S. 1556 [A.D. 1499] according to the SNPV, a rich merchant from Ambala, Purnamal Khattri, received in a dream from 'Srï Devadaman Thäkur', alias Srï Nâthjï, the order to build Him a large temple to replace the small shrine erected by Vallabhäcärya on the Govardhan hill. With the Acärya's permission, the building was started: it was to last no less than twenty years. This event marks a new era in the development of the Vallabhite or Pusti-märga sampradäya as a prosperous Vaisnava sect, whose influence was felt all over North-Western India. The temple dedicated to Srï Nâthjï in Govardhan is then said to be on a par with the four 'Vaisnava dhämas' or hallowed 'residences' of god Visnu-Hari: BadarEnäth, Jagannäth, Ranganäth and Dvärkänäth.5 The editions of the SNPV H. H. Tandon mentions four editions of the SNPV: (a) published at Näthdvärä (no publishers nor date mentioned); (b) published at the Lakshmi Venkateshvar Press [Bombay], n.d.; (c) published on the order of Munshi Navalkishore Bhargava, Mathura, S. 1884 [A.D. 1847] (Litho.); (d) edited by Mohan Vishnulal Pandey in S. 1925 [A.D. 1878] (no place given). Our translation is based on SnnâthjT kl präkatya värtä, composed by Sri" Harirây Mahänubhäva and published on the order of Sri Govindlalji Mahäräj, at 'Vidyä Vibhäg', Näthdvärä, in S. 2025 [A.D. 1973]. This edition shows a minimum of editing: the sentences are cut by the vertical dash, the vimma, and there has been an attempt at clarifying the narration by cutting out the episodes, each bearing a title indicating its contents. The episodes are listed and numbered in pages (2) to (6). But the printing is very poor and there are some errors and discrepancies here and there. As to the text of the Sanskrit sloka which precedes the Braj text — and which is supposed to have been culled from the</page><page sequence="18">18 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE Garga-samhitä6 - it is full of mistakes and had to be amended before translation.7 For want of a better edition, we had to make use of this one, which appears to be identical with the one mentioned first by H. H. Tandon as published in Näthdvärä itself (cf. supra a). The translation of the first 22 episodes of the SNPV only will be found here, since the remaining portion of the said Värtä deals with matters which go beyond the scope of the present paper. The edition of the Cauräsl vaisnavan ki värtä [CW] from which we quote is the edition by Dvärikädäs Parïkh, Sn Govardhan Granthamälä, Mathura, S. 2027 [A.D. 1975]. The edition is said to be based on a manuscript dated S. 1752 [A.D. 1675]. The text is carefully printed in bold type, each episode being followed by a com mentary (printed in smaller type) called Bhäva-prakäsa and said to have been written also by the same Harirayjï. Translation of the SNPV [Prologue] This is an account of the manner in which Sri Govardhannâthjî manifested Himself and of the marvellous deeds He performed in this world after His apparition. The account has been based on the Vacanämrta and other works composed by Sn Gokulnâthjï.8 Down to this day, Sri Govardhannäthjl is present in the rock-cave within the Govardhan hill, engaged in continual sport (nity a iTlä) with numerous devotees and there the Revered great Master and Lord9 is continually engaged in carrying on His service (seva)10 When, at the command of the Adorable Lord and in order to retrieve divine life (daivi jivan),11 he [Vallabhäcärya] appeared in the world, together with him all the necessary perquisites for the external sports (Iflä) of Sri Govardhannäthjl appeared too. The evidence for this occurrence as well as the glorification (mähätmya) of the event is found in the Giriräja-khanda of the Garga-samhitâ: Translation of the Sanskrit s'lokas 'The form in which Krsna lifted mount Govardhana, That very form, 0 King, is visible in the smgaramandala.12 After four thousand and five hundred years had elapsed From the beginning of the Kali Age, there, in the smgaramandala, From inside a cave of Giriräja, in the view of all, The self-accomplished Form of Hari will appear. Good people call Him 'Sri Nätha Devadaman';13</page><page sequence="19">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 19 On the hill called 'Giriräja', 0 King, He is for ever engaged in sport. Those who will contemplate the vision of that Form with their own eyes All their desires will be fulfilled in this Kali Age in the "SrTs'ailendra".14 Jagannätha, Ranganätha, Dvärakänätha And Badarxnâtha15 are found in the four corners of Bhäratavarsa — And in the middle, O Prince, this Lord of Govardhana is found: These are the five gods of gods, the Five Nâthas, in the holy Bhäratavarsa. They are the Pillars of the temple of true Dharma, the Protection of the afflicted: Having obtained to see them, man becomes like Näräyana! A man of good disposition, having performed a pilgrimage to the four Nâthas, If he omits to visit Devadaman, all his pilgrimages are fruitless — But if he only visits Sri Nätha Devadaman on the Govardhana mountain, He obtains the fruit of the pilgrimage to all the four Nâthas in this world". Translation of the VARTA text § 1. The manifestation of the Risen Arm In the year S 1466 [A.D. 1409] on the third day of the dark half of Srävan, on a Sunday, at dawn, in the Sravana naksatra, the Risen Arm of Sri Govardhannathjl made its appearance. This was a matter of great rejoicing in the whole world. One cow which belonged to a Brajvâsï16 of the Anyor village17 had absconded. As her owner was searching for her, he reached mount Govardhan. There, on the 'Miti' tithi of the fifth day of the bright half of Srävan, i.e. on the 'Nag Pancamï' day of the Samvat year 1466, he had the first vision (darsana) of the Risen Arm of Sri Govardhannathjl.18 For sixteen days nobody had seen it. Reflecting that, up to that day, nobody had ever seen such a marvel on mount Giriraj, the villager went and called five or ten more Brajväsls and he showed them the Risen Arm. Upon seeing it, they were greatly astonished. Of a common accord they drew the conclusion that some deity19 must have manifested itself on mount Girirâj. There was however an old Brajvâsï who told them: "Once upon a time, Sri Krsna kept mount Giriraj aloft for seven days together and, after the rain finally had come to an end, he put the hill down on the earth - and then all the Brajväsls of those days worshipped His arm: this is the very same Arm! He Himself therefore is standing within some rock cave below and it is He who has bestowed on you the vision of His Risen Arm.20 You must not therefore think of getting Him out of here: He will manifest Himself some time when He chooses to do so. Meanwhile be satisfied with the dars'an21 of the Risen Arm". Upon these words, the Brajväsls went to fetch milk: they bathed the Risen Arm in it and they worshipped it with fresh flowers, sandalpaste and Tulsï leaves and then they placed in front of it a meal (bhog) of curds and fruit.22 Since it was on a Näg</page><page sequence="20">20 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE PancamI day that the Arm had first been seen, every year, on that very day, ten to a thousand Brajvâsïs held a fair (melä) in its honour.23 If any one entertained a parti cular wish, he used to bathe the Arm in milk and his wish was fulfilled. In this way the fame and glory of the Arm of Sri Nâthjï began to spread and increase in the whole of the Braj country. If someone had lost a cow, if someone had no offspring, if some one else was in poor health or was short of milk and curds, all they had to do was to propitiate the Arm and all their desires were fulfilled.24 If one were to narrate all such marvellous deeds (caritra) wrought by the Risen Arm of Sri Nâthjï, it would take too long! In such a manner, up to the year S. 1535 [A.D. 1458] was the Arm worshipped in Braj. § 2. The manifestation of the Blessed Mouth Later then, in the year S. 1535 [A.D. 1478], on the eleventh day of the dark half of Vaisakh, as the naksatra Satäbhisä showing in the morning gave place to the naksatra Abhijit rising in the afternoon, the lotus-like Mouth (mukhârvind) of Srï Govard hannâthjî revealed Itself. At this particular instant, on that particular day, the Revered Äcäryajl [Valla bhäcärya] appeared too, coming out of the Agnikund:25 at the same time, the Brajvâsîs who had been contemporaries of the manifestation of Sri Krsna (s'rîkrsnâ vatära) reappeared here and these in different human families throughout the Braj country, in order that they might engage once more in the Lord's play (krïdâ).26 §3. The miracle of the milk In the village of Anyor lived two Brajväsls called Mânikcand and Saddüpände,27 who owed one thousand cows. One of these was of the lineage of Nandräy's cows28 and 'Dhümar' was her name.29 Every day she used to remain together with the other cows but in the evening, two hours before sunset, she left the herd and climbed on mount Giriräj. Then, putting her udder just above the Blessed Mouth of Srf Nâthjï, she let her milk flow into it. In the morning again, just before dawn, she used to go up the hill to feed the Mouth with her milk. In such wise she kept feeding Him for six months without any of the Brajväsls noticing it. Yet one day Mânikcand and Saddüpände noticed that this particular cow yielded very little milk, so they followed her: when they witnessed the miracle, they fell prostrate on their faces.30 § 4. Sri NathfT instructs Saddüpände Sri Nâthjï then bestowed a vision of Himself on Saddüpände and He instructed him in this way: As the resident deity of this Sri Govardhan hill, I am called 'Devadaman'. According to the various lîlâs I play, I assume the names of 'Indradaman', 'Devadaman' or 'Nägadaman'.31 For seven days together I intercepted the rain - and then the guilty Indra was humbled and he fell</page><page sequence="21">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 21 at my feet: then I reassured him and I rid him of his pride - hence my name of 'Indradaman'. I also overpowered Kälinäga and this is why I am also known as 'Nägadaman'. The word 'Nâga' also means 'Elephant', accordingly I overpowered the Kuvalayâpîda elephant, as I overpower the elephant-like pride of my devotees' mind, and then I rested my blessed hand on my waist,32 this is why I am called 'Nägadaman' and my feet bear the stamp of the goad, since, without a goad, an elephant cannot be controlled. I am called 'Devadaman' because I have humbled all the gods. In the Sri Krsna-avatära, I have humbled the eight Lokapâlas. Indra, Kubera, Candramä Vâyu, Varuna, Mrtyu, Yama, Agni, Brahmà, Siva and Kama, who are the main deities, I have humbled them all. This is why my name is 'Devadaman'. I humbled Indra in lifting the Govardhan hill and in stealing the Pârijâta tree. I humbled Kubera when, after the killing off of Sankhacüda, I entrusted all the treasures to him and ordered him to guard them with great care. Siva I humbled in the Usa episode.33 I humbled Brahma when I assumed the shapes of numerous calves in the vacchaharana episode. I got the better of Varuna when I released Sri Nandrâyjï from his bonds. I vanquished Death when I revived the six sons of Devakï and gave them back to her and I vanquished god Yama when I brought back my Guru's son to him. As to Väyu, I humbled him at the same time as I did Indra: when I was keeping the mount Govardhan aloft, there was a lot of wind and rain, but I stopped them all and so I saved all the people of Braj. I got the better of the Moon-god when I managed to make an illusory moon appear. As to Kämdev, I outdid him when I played the Räsa game (räsotsava kr'idä): in such wise did I defeat all the deities and this is why I am known as 'Devadaman'. Having spoken thus, Sri Nâthjï gave a straight order to Saddüpände: "I want to drink the milk of that cow of yours everyday. Henceforth you should milk her and bring her milk to drink morning and evening". Then Saddüpände prostrated himself before Him and promised to do as he was told. § 5. Saddüpände tells his family Thereupon Saddüpände went back home to Anyor and he told the whole story to his wife Bhavänl and his daughter Naro. He ordered them to feed Sri Govardhannâthjî with that milk everyday. From that time onwards, Naro and Bhavänl used to carry milk and feed Sri Nâthjï on Sri Giriraj with that milk. § 6. On Sri Nathfl 's order another cow is brought Things went on in this wise for some time. Then the cow got dry and Saddüpände went to fetch the milk of another cow to feed Sri Nâthjî but the latter told him: "You should feed me only the milk yielded by a cow belonging to the lineage of Nandrly's cows. There is another cow of this lineage and she will come to your stable to-morrow: until the first cow has calved, do feed me with the milk of that cow". § 7. Sri Nathjl's order to Dharmadäs and Kumbhandas In the village of Jamanävatau34 lived a Brajvâsî named Dharmadäs,35 who was a great devotee of the Adorable One. He was the paternal uncle of Kumbhandas36 and a disciple of Caturänägä.37 He owned only a few cows but one of them was of the lineage of Nandräy's cows. That cow having strayed from the herd went to sit over</page><page sequence="22">22 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE the Blessed Mouth of Sri Nâthjï and she let her milk flow into it. As she did not come home the cowherd Dharmadâs became anxious. Taking with him his nephew Kumbhandäs, he went in search of her. At that time Kumbhandäs was only ten years old. As they were looking for their cow all over Sri Girirâj, they found her squatting by the side of Srï Nâthjï. They tried to drag her home, but she would not budge. Then Sri Nâthjï Himself ordered: "0 Dharmadâs, do put this cow in Saddûpânde's stable: I myself shall feed on her milk since she is a cow belonging to my own family".38 As to Kumbhandäs, Sri Nâthjï told him to come over regularly to visit Him and play with Him. Hearing these exceedingly sweet words, Dharmadâs and Kumbhandäs fainted and they remained unconscious for a time. When they came to, they circumam bulated Srï Nâthjï and prostrated themselves before Him. According to the orders He had given them, they placed the cow in Saddûpânde's stable and went back home. From that day onwards, Kumbhandäs regularly went to play with Srï Nâthjï. § 8. Sri Nathfî's order to the Gaudiyä Mâdhavanand It so happened that one Bengali called Mädhavänand39 came to the Braj country in order to perform the parikramä of Sri Giriräj. He rested on the cabütara10 of Saddüpände ; then, in the company of those Brajvâsïs,41 went to have the dars'an of Sri Nâthjl, which gave him great joy. As he was a pious Vaisnava,42 he had in mind to beg dry food and then, after grinding the grains, to prepare some dainty dish and to offer it as a meal (bhog) to Sri Nathji. Then he set about to do Him service (sevä): he collected gunjâ seeds from the forest and made a garland of them, which he placed on Sri Näthjl's neck. He also brought a candrikâ from the forest to decorate the head of Sri Nâthjl.43 But when Mädhavänand brought Sri Nâthjl the meal he had prepared for Him, the god told him: When Sri Âcâryajï comes, he himself will prepare cooked food and he will perform the weaning ceremony for me: then only shall I have a meal. Until then, I shall take milk only. If you wish to make me eat cooked food and to adorn me, you should first engage into a parikramä of the whole world and then come back here. After Sri Âcâryajï himself has come here and installed me on my pedestal, I shall take you into my service. Meanwhile I shall remain here, playing with the Braivâsîs. On hearing these words, Mädhavendra Purl started on a world tour, waiting for the right time to come.44 Thus, till the year S. 1449 [A.D. 1492], Sri Näthjl kept feeding solely on the milk brought forth by the Brajvâsls. Sometimes though, in the company of Kumbhanddäs, He went to steal butter from their homes.45 § 9. The vow taken by a Brajvâsi of Puchfi There was a Brajväsvof Puchrl who had made a vow to Devadaman that if his son got married, he would offer him one and a quarter mound of milk and one and a quarter mound of curds. As his son got married, he presented the whole amount to</page><page sequence="23">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 23 the god. The news of this event spread in the Braj country and vows to Devadaman became very popular. § 10. The vow taken by a BrajvâsT of Bhavanpurä There was at Bhavanpurä a Brajvâsî whose cow got lost in a thickly wooded area which was the repair of a lion. In his anxiety, the villager made a vow to Devadaman: 'If my cow is not eaten by the lion, I shall offer her milk to the god as long as she yields milk'. At night, the lion found the cow but he could not attack her since Sn Nâthjl, stretching his own arm, caught her by the ear and put her back into her stable. In the morning, when the villager found his cow, he was very glad. Knowing that she had been saved by Devadaman, he began to bring Him offerings of milk and curds. As to Sri Näthjl, He told Kumbhandäs: 'O Kumbhandäs, my arm is aching because I have caught that cow by the ear and put her back into her stable : do massage my arm!' Henceforward, all the Brajvâsls and the cows who had been the contemporaries of the Krsna-avatära began to reappear in the vicinity of Sri Giriräj in order to sport once again with Sri NäthjL46 And the god was wont to eat someone's butter, some one else's curds and also to go and steal milk and curds in someone's house and to feast on it all. §11. Manifestation of the Vyuhas for the protection of Sri Nathjï In order to keep watch over Sri Nathjï, the four Vyühas47 manifested them selves on Sri Giriräj together with Himself: from the Sankarsan-kund appeared Srf Sankarçaijdev; from the Govind-kund appeared Srï Govinddevjï; from the Dânghâtï appeared Sri Däniräyjf and from the Srrkund appeared Sri Haridevjf. These four deities are essentially identical with the four gods Sankarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna and Aniruddha and they remain for ever in the company of Sri Nathjï to keep watch over Him. Some Vaisnavas worship them somewhat differently.48 In the midst of them all, He (Srï Nathjï) is present in his own Form as 'Purusottam': that is why, in order that He may be worshipped by them too, Purusottam assumed the form of Sri Âcâryajï.49 It is well known that His essential Form is Srï Purusottam — this is why Aijuna says in the tenth chapter of the Bhagavad-gltä: na hi te bhagavan vyaktim vidur deva na dänavah svayam evâtmanàtmanam vettha tvam purusottama [BhG X. 14-15] [*0 Bhagavan! Neither the devas nor the dänavas know your nature. You Yourself, O Purusottama, know Yourself through Yourself] § 12. Sri Näthfl orders Sri Äcäryajl to initiate His 'service ' In the year S. 1549 [A.D. 1492], on the eleventh day of the bright half of PhUgun,50 a Thursday, as Sri Äcäryajl was in the Jhârkhand,51 Sri Nâthjï gave him this order:</page><page sequence="24">24 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE As you know well, I am present in a cave of Sri Giriiäj under my essential form (svariipa) of 'Sri Govardhanadhara'. None but the Brajvâsïs who live over there had a vision of Myself.52 Now 1 intend to make myself manifest to all but, for that purpose, I have been waiting for you. So now you must go quickly to establish my cult (sevâ) over there. The people who were living there at the time of the Krsna-avatära have come back to the Braj country. Do take them under your protection and make them my 'servants' (sevaka) and I Myself will play with them, so that, besides the dignity of being Sri Hari's slaves they will also obtain the favour of my own § 13. Sri Âcâryafl goes to Braj and does away with the curse on Viiramghat Thereupon Sri Äcäryaj! immediately interrupted his world pilgrimage and, from the Jhärkhand, he went up to the Braj country. He first went to Mathurä and stayed in the house of one Ujagar Chobe.54 f...] § 14. Sri Äcäryaji Mahäprabhu goes to Sri Giriräj looking for Sri Nâthfî From Mathurä, Sri Äcäryaji Mahäprabhu went to the foot-path (tarahatl) around Sri Govardhan, accompanied by all his own disciples.55 He took his seat on the cabütarä in front of Saddüpände's house in Anyor. When they saw him, a large number of Brajvâsïs recognized him as a great soul (mahäpurusa): such was his spiritual radiance, that there was none like him among men. Thereupon Saddüpände entreated him, saying: 'Lord, will you have a meal?' But his disciple Krsnadäs Meghan declared that the Lord would not take any food but from the hands of his own disciples.56 Just as Krsnadäs had rejected Saddüpände's invitation, Sri Govar dhannâthjï called from the top of Sri Govardhan in such a way as to be heard by Sri ÄcäryajT: 'Ho! Naro! Bring Me my milk!' Naro shouted back: 'To-day we have guests!'. Sri Näthjl retorted: 'Alright, you have guests! Yet bring me my milk!'. Naro replied: 'Just a minute, I am bringing it, my dear Little One!' And she filled a pot with milk and took it up to Him. Then Äcäryaji Mahäprabhu said: 'I have heard something'. His disciple Dämodar told him: '0 Mahäräj, I too have heard it but I did not understand'. Then Äcäryaji Mahäprabhu told him: 'The One who has just spoken is the same One who had instructed me in the forest: it is here that Sri Näthjl has manifested Himself. Thereupon Naro came back after feeding Sri Näthjl with milk and Sri Äcarya Mahäprabhu asked her if there was anything left over of that milk. Naro replied: 'Mahäräj, we have plenty of milk at home, take as much as you want'. But Sri Äcäryaji Mahäprabhu refused, saying: 'I want nothing else but that left-over milk'. Then Saddüpände asked for the favour of becoming a disciple of the Äcärya and Sri Äcäryaji Mahäprabhu gave him the Name and he made him a disciple,57 together with a number of other Brajvâsïs and he embraced them all. Later that night all the Brajvâsï disciples, Saddüpände, Mänikcandpände and the others prostrated themselves before Sri Äcaryajl Mahäprabhu and sat at his feet. The Äcärya asked them to narrate to him the manner in which Sri Devadaman had</page><page sequence="25">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 25 manifested Himself on the hill. Saddüpände replied: 'O Mahäräj! You know all, yet you ask from us!' Yet, on being ordered by Sri Äcäryajl Mahäprabhu, Saddüpände narrated the whole story of the manifestation of Sri Näthjl and this tale delighted the heart of Sri Äcäryajl Mahäprabhu.58 § 15. Meeting of Sri Acaryajï Mahäprabhu with Sri Nathjl Next morning, Sri Äcäryajl Mahäprabhu, in great joy, went to meet Sri Nâthjï, accompanied by all his disciples. Sri Näthji received him with great happiness. Their common joy was celebrated by Gopâldâsjî in the poem: 'Great was the Joy of the Saviour of Govardhan at this meeting. . § 16. On order from SrT Näthjl, Sri Äcarya/7 instals Him Sri Näthjl instructed Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu to make Him stand on a pedestal and to show the way in which his own sevä should be conducted for without sevä there is no admittance within the Pusti-märga.59 Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu therefore had a small shrine erected and within that shrine he installed the pedestal of Sri Näthjl.60 Near the Apsara-kund, within a rock-cave, lived one Rämdäsjl Bhagavadlya.61 When he came to know of the arrival of Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu, he too became his disciple. Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu ordered Rämdäsjl to perform the sevä of Srï Nâthjï. Rämdäsjl replied: '0 Maharäj! I have no idea how this sevä should be per formed!' Then Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu, knowing this to be Srï Nâthjï's wish, told him that Sri Näthjl Himself would teach him. Then Srï Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu had a candrikà ornament made for Srï Nâthjï. He adorned Him and performed his sevä and he instructed Rämdäsjl about his duties: Everyday, on rising, he [Rämdäsjl] should bathe in the Govind-kund. Then he should fill a vessel with the water of that pond and bring it to the temple for Sri Nâthjï's bath. He should bathe and adorn Him in the same way as we adorn ourselves. After saluting Him respectfully, he should place the gunjâ candrikà on his head and bring Him anything He might wish for. Then he should offer a meal to Srï Thâkurjï62 and then feed himself upon that same food. As to these Brajväsls, they will only offer Him meals of milk, curds and butter.63 Later, Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu told Saddüpände and all the Brajväsls: 'Sri Govardhannâthjî is my All: do ye remain devoted to His service. Be careful to avoid any mistake and do all that is in your power to keep Him happy'. Having spoken thus, Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu departed to resume his world parikramä. Up to the day when Sri Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu had prepared cooked food for Sri Näthjl with his own hands and offered it to Him, Sri Näthjl had not taken any solid food: he had taken nothing but milk and curds. But from that day onwards, He began</page><page sequence="26">26 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE to snatch food-packets from the Brajvâsls and eat them up. [...] [.. .] The following two episodes: § 17: Pätho Güjrl of Gâmthyolï and § 18: Khemo Güjri of Govardhan show how 'Sri Devadaman' alias Sri Nâthjï keeps stalking the land of Braj, extorting food from cowherd women on the way to the fields or the pasture grounds, when they carried the midday meal of their men.64 § 19. 1 he Bra]vasi Oopal Gwal from Ading There was a certain Go pal Gwâl, a Brajvâsî from Ading. As he was in the Ading forest, Sri Devadaman appeared to him and told him to give Him milk and bread. The man milked his cow in the forest itself and offered the milk to Him together with the bread that he had taken for his own midday meal. Then SrT Devadaman told Gopâl Gwâl to come regularly to have His dars'an on the Govardhan hill. He Himself was anxious to appear in His own essential Form (svafüpa) but the people who continuously came to have His darsan would not attempt to rid Him of His attire. This is why He instructed Gopâl Gwâl beforehand that he should strip Him of his attire66 when he came to see Him. When Gopâl Gwâl prostrated himself at His feet, He was so moved at heart that He shed a flood of tears and His baby shirt67 was all wet! Then two men took hold of Gopâl Gwâl and brought him down from Sri Giriräj. § 20. The Brahman boy from Agra68 There was in Ägrä a Brahman boy who got a vision of Devadaman in a dream. Devadaman told the boy: 'I am the Master (thäkur) of Braj. Do come to Sri Giriräj and take my dars'an'. In the morning, the Brahmin boy insisted to be taken to Braj in order to have the dars'an of Sri Thâkuijî of Braj. Then his father took him to have the dars'an of all the 'Thakurs' in Braj; yet the boy was not happy at heart. But, when he was shown Sri Näthjl he said: 'This one was the very same Thäkurjl whom I have contemplated in my dream'.69 Then Sri Näthjl took hold of the boy's arm and, lifting him bodily, he placed him among his own company of cowherd boys.70 The boy's father too was very glad to have the dars'an of Sri Näthjl. He Himself was a Vaisnava, belonging to the Mädhva sect. He therefore understood that the boy had gone to Whom he belonged too. So comforted in his mind, he did not insist and he went back home. Later that Brahman ot Agrä became a famous Vaisnava, Premnidhi was his name. He is praised in a stanza in the Bhakta-mâl, where he is referred to as 'Premnidhi Mis'ra'.71 In such wise did Sri TMkuijî work innumerable wonders among the Brajvâsfs. § 21. Mändaliyä Fände of Sakhltarä In Sakhltarä lived a certain Mändaliyä Pände. On the very day a new daughter-in-law had come to his house, his buffalo got lost. Se he said: "That daughter-in-law brings</page><page sequence="27">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 27 bad luck: who knows what she may be up to later?' The daughter-in-law was much pained by these words, so she made a vow to Devadaman, promising that, if the buffalo was found again, she would offer Him ten sers of butter. As soon as she had made that vow, the buffalo was recovered and the people of the house were well pleased. So she began to churn in earnest: everyday she used to churn five or seven sers of butter out of which she stole half a ser, which she put away. When she had secured the ten pounds of butter, she put them in ajar and she entreated Sri Devadaman to come and take away his butter, since she could not go to Him in front of her mother-in-law and the people of the house. Hearing her prayer, Sri" Devadaman came in person to the house, He Himself fetched the jar of butter and went back to Sri Giriräj. He Himself ate some of the butter, distributed some among his companions, gave some to other cowherd boys, besmeared Kumbhandäs' mouth with it and then threw the rest on Sri"Giriräj. That day happened to be Janmästami day. So in this way He Himself celebrated the feast with great gusto and Kumbhandäs sang a poem in the Sorath räg beginning with the words: 'The whole courtyard has become an Ocean of curds . . .,Ti § 22. A devotee of Bhagavän, Caturänägä of the Tond forest There was a certain devotee of Bhagavän called 'Caturänägä', who was practicing penance in the Tond forest. He had never set foot on mount Giriräj!73 In order to grant him a vision of Himself, Sri Näthjl mounted a buffalo and entered the Tond forest, accompanied by Saddûpânde and others.74 When that great man [Caturänägä] had obtained the dars'an of Sri Näthjl, in order to celebrate the occasion he collected some kikora berries from the forest and cooked them as a vegetable. He also made a kind of syrup and then presented the whole as a meal to Sri Näthjl.75 As He was eating the meal, Sri Näthjl asked Kumbhandäs to sing a klrtan and Kumbhandäs sang this song: [Räg Särang] Pleasing to You to You indeed is that Tond jungle Where thorns and thistles grip you from every side, tearing and blistering! Does a lion fear a fox? Why have you taken on this disguise? Says Kumbhandâs, are You not the Lifter of the Govardhan hill? Who is that son-of-a-Dhedhnî harlot?76 In the year S. 1552 [A.D. 1495], on the 13th day of the bright half of the Srävan month, a Thursday, he himself went up to Sri Giriräj and he began to sport with the Brajväsls in so many ways.77 [With this episode the first part of the SNPV concludes. The next episode relates the circumstances in which the building of the great Sri Nathjl temple in Govardhan was undertaken by a rich merchant, Pürnamal Ksattrl of Ambäla in the S. year 1556 [A.D. 1499]]. Université de la Sorbonne nouvelle, Paris</page><page sequence="28">28 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE NOTES ' A study of this literature is to be found in Hindi: H. H. Tandon, Vârtâ sâhitya, Aligarh, 1960. 2 This prose literature in Râjasthânï appears parallel to the Braj varia from which it differs mostly in the subject: the Râjasthânï khyät is usually historical or semi-historical, while the bât (tadbhav for vârtâ) is a prose narrative on a heroic or romantic theme, such as the Gorâ Bâdalkl bât (in mixed prose and verse) by Jatmal, composed in S. 1680 [A.D. 1623]. Tandon (op. cit. p. 71) is of the opinion that the Braj vârtâ and the Râjasthânï bât represent the same ancient tradition of popular narrative prose, frequently interspersed with verse. 3 The long-lived Hariray (said to have reached 125 years) is also credited with some composi tions in Panjâbï and Marwâri (cf. Tandon, op. cit. p. 121). Vittalnâth himself, like his father Vallabha and his elder brother Gopinàth, wrote only in Sanskrit. He must have had, however, a working knowledge of Braj, and possibly of Gujarâtï, in order to instruct his non-Brâhman disciples. As to his nephew Gokulnäth, he was well-versed both in Sanskrit and Braj. From the time of Hariräy onwards, Braj Bhäsä tends to replace Sanskrit as the official language of the sect, with Gujarâtï as a close second. 4 Tandon, op. cit. pp. 152 f. 5 Cf. infra, s'loka 6. 6 This is one of the spurious samhitâs mentioned in O. Schräder, Introduction to the Pâncarâtra and the Ahirbudhnya Safnhitâ, Madras, 1916, Synopsis, p. 7. 7 The text of this Sanskrit sloka, as printed in the edition, is rather corrupt. We are grateful to Dr M. A. Mehendale, Joint Director of the Deccan College, Poona, for his help in emending it. 8 About Gokulnäth, sec supra note 3. 9 Sri âcâryafi mahâprabhu always refers to Vallabhâcârya, the divinized founder of the Pusti-sampradâya sect. 10 sevâ, literally 'service', in our text, refers to the elaborate ritual of round-the-clock worship which is characteristic of the Vallabhite cult This kind of ritual is said to have been introduced in the cult of Sri Nâthjï by Vallabhâcârya himself. 11 According to sectarian belief, Vallabhâcârya and his successors were able to discern the daivi ßvas, 'divine souls' from all other men and to bring about their salvation by giving them the initiation in the form of Brahma-sambandha : in this way was daivi jivan re-introduced in this perverse world. 12 Lit 'the Circle (or the Land) of Love': this here designates the Land of Braj (braj-bhiimi) which was the scene of the famous erotic plays of Krsna-Gopâl with the Gopis. 13 Devadaman' seems to have been a local name of Sri Govardhanâthjï; see infra transi. § 4. 14 srisailendra, 'the Indra (i.e. King) of the holy mountains' here refers to the Govardhan hill, though there is probably an allusion to the famous hill and shrine in Andhra Pradesh known as 'Sri Sailam' and sacred to god Siva. 15 Jagannâth at Puri (Orissa), Ranganäth at Srirangam (Tamil Nad), Dvärkänäth at Dvärkä (Saurashtra) and Badrinäth in the Himalayas are given here as the 'Four Residences' (câr dhâma) sacred to all Vaisnavas. An older list includes Ràmesvaram (the Saiva shrine at the Southernmost tip of the Deccan) instead of Srirangam. 16 In our text, the word 'Brajvâsï', lit. 'a resident of Braj', exclusively refers to the rural popula tion of the area around Govardhan. Apparently they all belong to the pastoral tribes (Jâts or Gujärs) occupying the area, though some rich and influent 'Brajvâsïs' call themselves 'Pindes', such as 'Saddûpânde' (cf. TransL § 3 ff.). It is interesting to note that the 'Vaisnavas' mentioned later as living in the area are never referred to as 'Brajvâsïs'. Surprisingly, the first finder of the 'Risen Arm' is not mentioned by name: he is just an anonymous cowherd, whereas the pur ported date at which that miraculous manifestation occurred is specified. 17 The village of Anyor or 'Anyaur' (annakuta-grâma) is situated at the South-Western extremity of the Govardhan hill, in the vicinity of the village of Puchri. " In Vallabhite iconography, the image of Sri Govardhannâthjï or 'Sri Nâthjf* clearly shows an</page><page sequence="29">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 29 upturned palm with its five fingers joined together emerging from the vault of a rocky cave. The delineation of the cave is one of the essential characteristics which distinguish 'Sri Nâthjï' from other very similar Krishnaite images; cf. supra p. 6. 19 The 'Brajvâsïs' do not seem to be able straightaway to identify the 'Risen Arm' as the arm of Sri Krsna: apparently they first take it as the manifestation of some up-to-now unknown 'deity' (devatä). 20 The brief account of the govardhana-dharana episode by 'an old Brajväsl' suggests that that famous legend was not unknown to the local inhabitants but that they did not worship Krsna Gopäl under his particular form of Govardhanadhara. On the other hand they definitely believed in the 'physical' presence of a deity hidden in a rock-cave within the holy hill. 21 The word darsan (Skt darsana) 'vision' is used in common parlance in Braj and in all the new I.A. vernaculars to mean the action of'taking a look' at the visible deity or at a revered idol, a religious act which confers merit (punya): we have therefore kept the word darsan (in its Braj form) in our translation. The deity grants Its darsan and the devotee seeks it. 22 The bathing in milk appears as the most essential part of the primitive worship of the 'Risen Arm' of Sri Nâthjï. Uncooked food is also offered and the mention of Tulasi leaves, sacred to Visnu-Hari, here suggests that the deity is recognized as a form of Visnu-Krsna. 23 It is more than likely that the Nag Pancami meh at Govardhan was established long before the manifestation of the 'Risen Arm' of Sri Nâthjï as dated by our text. About the connection between the worship of Sri Nâthjï and Näga worship, cf. supra p. 7 ff. 24 No devotional element or Bhakti cult seems to have developed at that stage. The 'Risen Arm' is propitiated in order to insure the welfare of the cattle and cowherds, as befits the name of govardhana, 'Increaser of cattle', given to the sacred hill. 25 Our text ascribes to the miraculous manifestation of the 'Lotus-Face' (or 'Lotus-Mouth') of Sri Nâthjï the very same date which is traditionally ascribed to the birth or 'Manifestation' of Sri Âcârya Mahâprabhu, alias Vallabhäcärya upon the earth (S. 1535), so that the twin avatäras appear at the same moment. Vallabha's birth was not a natural one: he is said to have appeared out of the Agnikund, one of the sacred tanks of Braj. Both events are said to have taken place on an ekadaü day, as befits a double Visnu-avatara. The manifestation of Sri Nâthjï and that of Âcârya Mahâprabhu at the same moment reflects the sectarian (Vallabhite) view of the advent of Sri Nâthjï as a cosmic event: the re-enactment of the original Krsna-avatâra which had taken place in the days of yore, before this Kali-yuga began. 26 This re-apparition of Krsna-Gopâl in the land of his birth in the midst of the Kali Age calls for a mass-avatära of His legendary companions, the Gopas and Gopïs, whose presence is necessary for a renewed performance of the Cowherd god's famed sports in the land of Braj. 27 According to CW (värtä 83, p. 478), Mänikcand was Saddüpände's brother. These two are given as 'Brajvâsl Brâhmans' and at the same time rich cattle-owners. Their brahmanical status remains however doubtful: see n. 16 and n. 57. 28 Nandrây (Nandaräjä) was the headman of the Gopä village (gokula) where Krsna was brought up and his adoptive father. Nandräy's cows - which Krsna once used to pasture and on whose milk he was fed - and their descendance constitute a kula, a distinct lineage, among the cattle of Braj: only a cow from such a holy family was worthy to feed Sri Govardhannâthjï. The Brahmanical - and especially the Vallabhite - obsession with blood inheritance and purity of lineage is naively expressed here. Up to this day a 'Mother Cow' (gomätä), said to be a descendant of Krsna's own cow, is the object of a special cult in Näthdvärä. 29 dhumar means 'smoke-coloured' and refers to a darkish cow: it is just fitting that the holy cow who had taken on herself the task of feeding the new manifestation of Sri Krsna be dark hued like Himself. 30 Similar stories about the discovery of a stone deity out of the earth through a cow are found all over India, either in a Saiva or a Vaisnava context and even in a Jaina context, as in the village of Mahavïijï near Hindaun, in North-east Räjasthän, where a mürtl of Mahavïrjï (the first Jaina Tïrthankara) was found by an Ahïr in similar circumstances. The Siva-lingam enshrined in the</page><page sequence="30">30 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE famous Sri Sailam shrine in Andhra Piadesh was discovered in the same way (cf. S. K. Iyengar, History of Tirupati vol. I; cf. also BLF n. 41. In a recent paper by Günther Sontheimer (Some incidents in the history of god Khandoba, Asie du Sud, Traditions et Changements, VIth European Conference on Modem South Asian Studies, pub. C.N.R.S. Paris 1978), the author refers to a story narrated to him by a Maharashtrian Koll about the discovery of a divine stone which was a form of god Khandobâ in the village of Cilhure in the Konkan, by a member of the Gavll (cattle-men) caste, in the same way. A similar story is told about the discovery of the Gopanäth lingam, worshipped in the Gopanäth temple in Saurashtra near the Satrunjaya hill. According to the local legend, this Gopanäth, "Lord of Gopas" i.e. Siva, was worshipped by the great Vaisnava saint Narasi Mahatä, to whom Siva himself granted a vision of the räsa-Iilä of Sri Krsna. What is characteristic about these stories is that in all of them the discovery, occasioned by a cow, is made by a Ahir or Gwälä, i.e. a member of the pastoral castes. In the Jain story, the murti of 'Mahavïrjï' even refuses to be dragged to the village by any one but a Gwälä. As all the pastoral castes in India are Siva and Devi-worshippers, it is likely that the story of the discovery of Sri Govardhannäthji by two cattle-owners of Braj is not originally a Vaisnava story. 31 The name 'Devadaman' or 'Sri Näth Devadaman' seems to have been the name given to the deity of the Govardhan hill by the local peoplç, the Brajväsis. In CW, värtä 48 prasanga 3, it is said that in the beginning all the Brajväsis called their god 'Devadaman' - later they called him 'Gopäl' and then later Vallabhäcärya called Him 'Sri Govardhannäthji'. The two most spectacular feats accomplished by Krsna-Gopäl - his victory over god Indra in the govardhana-dharana episode and over the Näga Käliya in the Kaliya-damana episode - account for his titles of 'Indradaman' and 'Nägadaman'. In the passage which follows the sectarian writer tries to establish Krsna's rightful claim to his title 'Devadaman' by showing how He had managed to get the better of each and every god of any repute in the Hindu Pantheon. 32 This detail seems to account for the peculiar position of Sri Näthji's right hand, which rests on his waist. The detail is not found in any of the Puranic accounts. In ancient iconography, while Krsna's left hand lifts the mountain, his right hand takes support on his thigh or hangs along his side. Among the two-handed forms of Visnu-Krsna, the only one which represents him with both hands resting on his waist, in a playful attitude is god Vitthala of Pandharpür. The latter is somehow included in the Vallabhite cult as a distinct svarUpa murti under the name of Vitthales' or Vitthalnäthji, who belongs to the second branch of the Sarhpradäya and is now found in Näthdvärä. 33 This refers to Bhäg.P. X.63 narrating the fight between Siva and Krsna, after the latter's son, Aniruddha, had abducted Usä, daughter of the Daitya king Bäna, a staunch devotee of god Siva, who had vowed to protect him from Krsna's wrath. The fight ended with the defeat of Siva and his acknowledging Krsna's superiority. 34 About the situation of that village, see supra I, p. 9-10. 35 Dharmadäs, uncle of Kumbhandäs (see below n. 36) is also a Brajväsi and a cowherd by caste. He is the only Brajväsi who, from the start, is expressly mentioned as 'a great bhakta of Bhagavän' (baro bhagavat bhakta). From this we may infer that, even before Vallabhäcärya appeared in Braj, he was already known as a devotee of Visnu-Krsna, like his guru Caturänägä (cf. note 73). Neither Caturänägä nor Dharmadäs are mentioned in Vallabhite hagiography : apparently these two were and remained non-sectarian Vaisnavas. 36 Kumbhandäs holds an important place in the Vallabhite tradition. His story is told in the CW (värtä 83, pp. 488-526) where he appears together with Saddupânde, Mänikcandpände and Rämdäs Cauhän as one of the four prominent disciples of Vallabhäcärya in Braj, all of them being intimately connected with the establishment of the Sri Näthji cult. The CW does not mention the early role of Kumbhandäs as a child, enjoying the extraordinary privilege of being Sri Näthji's regular playmate. The CW narration only concerns the adult Kumbhandäs: how Kumbhandäs and his wife came from Jamanävatau to prostrate themselves at the Äcärya's feet upon the latter's arrival at Saddüpände's house and how they received from him the nâma-dïksâ (initiation through</page><page sequence="31">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 31 the imparting of the divine Name). As a saint-poet, Kumbhandäs was included among the astachäp, the 'Eight Seals' of the Vallabhite faith. After the sevä of Sri Näthj! was established at Govardhan, Vallabhäcärya put Kumbhandis in charge of the k'irtana, the devotional singing (in Braj verse) to be performed in the presence of the deity. 37 About Caturänägä, see infra Transi. § 22, and note 73. 38 The reason why Dharmadäs's cow had to be transferred from his stable to that of Saddüpände before she be allowed to feed Sri Nâthjï is not explicitly stated. We may surmise that, in the sectarian tradition, Saddüpände and his family had secured the exclusive right to supply milk for Sri Nâthjï. The fact that Dharmadäs himself did not receive initiation from Vallabhäcärya must have been a major impediment to his fulfilling this exalted function. 39 This 'Mädhavänand' from Gauda (West Bengal) appears as the first 'foreigner' (i.e. non Brajväsl) to have had the dars'an of the newly discovered deity. A few lines below the same personage is called 'Mädhavendra Puri', which leaves no doubt as to his identical with the famous Mädhavendra Puri of Gaudïya Vaisnava tradition, who was the guru of Isvara Puri, Caitanya's own guru. Some data about Mädhavendra Puri's role in the establishment of the cult of Sri Govardhannäthji in Braj and his subsequent disappearance from the scene are found in the SNPV itself (§§ 30 and 37-42) but the Vallabhite account cannot be reconciled with the Gaudïya account as found in the Caitanya Caritâmrta (Madhya lïlâ ch. 4). The two conflicting traditions reflect the antagonism between the two sects, the Gaudiyas claiming that Mädhavendra Puri himself was at the very origin of the establishment of the Sri Nâthjï cult. 40 A stone platform under a large tree, built in front of Saddüpände's house: apparently this cabiitara was used as a resting place for itinerant sâdhus. 41 Besides Saddüpände, the 'Brajvâsïsî mentioned here must be Mänikpände, Rämdäs Cohän and Kumbhandäs, who are mentioned in the CW (värtä 83) as the 'Four Vaisnavas' of Braj, i.e. as the four main converts made in Braj by Vallabhäcärya. Before their initiation, these prominent devotees of Sri Nâthjï are not referred to as 'Vaisnavas'. 42 vaisnava bhavanika: characteristically, Mädhavendra Puri is the first personage in the SNPV to be introduced as a 'Vaisnava'. Though initiated as a Sannyäsl of the Puri branch of Sankarite ascetics, he was recognized even by the Vallabhites as a 'Vaisnava' (Brähmana) in his own right. As such, Mädhavendra Puri was entitled to start the official sevä of Sri Govardhannäthji and to perform the necessary rituals, which actually he set about to do. But according to the Vallabhite tradition, it was Sri Näthji himself who refused Mädhavänand's sevä or at least the bhoga (ritual meal) part of the sevä, which he wanted to eat only from Vallabhäcärya's hands. As long as the latter had not appeared, Sri Nâthjï would only eat uncooked food from the hands of pious Brajväsis. 43 The candrika is a kind of chain decoration to be pinned on a turban. Mädhavendra Puri, a wandering Sannyäsl, would not use pearls or jewels but gunjä seeds. The malà he prepared for the god was also made of gunjä seeds, it was therefore a vanamälä, 'forest-garland', though not made of flowers. This ritual decoration (srngära) is a part of the daily sevä, prior to the first cooked meal, bhoga, which Mädhavendra did cook, but which was refused by Sri Nâthjï. 44 Sri Nâthjï dismisses Mädhavendra Puri, with the promise to accept him again at his service after he has been installed by Vallabhäcärya. But it is clear that the ability of Mädhavendra Puri to perform all the rites, including the bhoga for Sri Nâthjï, is not questioned. This passage, as well as the short biography of Mädhavendra Puri found in §§ 30 and 37-42 of the SNPV, shows that the Vallabhite tradition, though respectful of the memory of that famous Vaisnava, was always anxious to maintain that Vallabhäcärya himself, and not Mädhavendra Puri, was the true initiator of the sevä of Sri Govardhannäthji at Govardhan; see supra note 39. 45 Though already the object of a cult in his svariipa form of Sri Nâthjï on the Govardhan hill, Krsna-Gopäl keeps the mobility andknavishness of a cowherd lad. There is little doubt that the makhan-cor element belongs to the primitive nucleus of the Cowherd-god legend. 44 The renewed avatäras of Krsna-Gopäl's human family and Gopa companions, which are said to be concomitant with Vallabhäcärya's birth, include also that of his cows: a new environment</page><page sequence="32">32 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE is re-created, which is not only similar but essentially Identical' with the former. The present Kali-yuga is miraculously abolished and the Dväpara-yuga, which saw the birth of Krsna, is restored. 4' The doctrine of the four Vyühas (Väsudeva, Sankarsana or Balaräma, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) is borrowed from the Päncarätra system. According to Schräder (op. cit. p. 19), the terminus ad quern for the original Päncarätra Samhitäs would be the eighth century A.D. The class of the apocryphal Samhitäs includes all the Samhitäs composed to boost up cults or beliefs of modern growth, such as the Vallabhite doctrine. Here we find a new interpretation of the four Vyühas, no longer as emanations of the same divine essence, but as secondary forms or 'manifestations' meant to provide Sri Nâthjï with some kind of a guard of honour. The four are svarupa icons, worshipped in near-by shrines. The temple of Haridevjï is situated just above the Mânasï Gangä, cf. I note 22; 'Sri kund' is Sri-Rädhä-kund, a spot 're-discovered' by Caitanya, north-east of the Govardhan hill. 48 matantara, 'with a different opinion' or 'outlook'. This guarded statement shows that the author of the SNPV is aware that his interpretation of the four Vyühas as identical with those four popular idols might not be acceptable to all 'Vaisnavas'. There is probably here an allusion to the four Nilarmdhavas worshipped in Orissa as secondary forms of the god Jagannäth. Nïlamâdhava is a black-stone icon of a standing four-armed Visnu. According to K. C. Misra, The Cult of Jagannätha, Calcutta, 1971, p. 18, NUamadhäva, worshipped by the Savara aboriginal tribe "is the previous form of the present Jagannäth". 49 In the Päncarätra system, as shown in the Mahâsanatkumàra-samhita, Aniruddha is equated with Purusottama (cf. Schräder, op. cit. p. 36). In the Bhâgavata tradition as a whole, Purusottama is another term for Bhagavän, Visnu-Hari as the supreme Being, object of Bhakti. In medieval and modern Vaishnavism, Purusottama is a name for god Jagannäth of Puri, the ksetra itself being called Purusottama-ksetra. According to the SNPV, Sri Nâthjï and Vallabhäcärya are twin avatäras of Purusottama; cf. supra transi. § 2 and note 25. 50 Again, the vision granted by Sri Nâthjï to Vallabha is said to have taken place on an ekâdas'î day, see note 25. 51 Jhärkhand, 'the bush country', loosely refers to the jungles of Central India, especially to the regions inhabited by the Gond aboriginals (Gondwana). The chronology of Vallabha's numerous pilgrimages all over India remains somewhat uncertain, and also the exact order in which he visited the various tirthas. It seems that he only visited the Braj country towards the end of a very long pilgrimage in south India (which may have lasted two decades) and a stay at Vijayanagar. In all probability, Vallabha came to Mathurä after he had visited the Dvärkä shrine in Saurashtra. All Vallabhite sources agree that the decision to start the cult of Sri Govardhannâthjï in Govardhan and to establish a new sampradäya was prompted by a vision granted to Vallabha by Sri Nâthjï Himself. Yet most authorities within the Vallabhite sect locate that vision in Braj itself and not in the Jhärkhand, as does the SNPV. Cf. M. S. Parekh, Shri Vallabhacharya, Life, Teachings and Movement, Rajkot, 1943,pp. 51 ff; J. G. Shah, Shrimad Vallabhacharya, his Philosophy and Religion, Nadiad, 1960 pp. 29 ff. 52 This statement attributed to Sri Nâthjï here seems to deny the role played by Mädhavendra Puri, see supra Transi. § 8. 53 Parekh (op. cit. pp. 40 ff.) mentions another vision granted to Vallabhäcärya during his pilgrimage of South India. He visited Kaundinyäs'rama, the äs'rama of Rsi Kaundinya, situated between Nilädri and Malayädri in a deep forest of sandal wood. There Kaundinya rsi appeared to him and gave him instruction. Vallabha was told that Kaundinya rsi's ädiguru, was Sändilya rsi himself (the author of the Sândilya-bhakti-sûtra), who had performed penance for a long time on mount Govardhan in order that God might manifest Himself to him. There Sändilya had a vision of a 'Munikanyä' (an ascetic young girl) named Lalitädevi, who herself gave him instruction in the Way of Bhakti. This rather obscure story apparently is meant to suggest that Sändilya rsi, a well-known authority on Vaisnava bhakti, was the initiator or at least the precursor of Vallabhäcärya in initiating the Sri Govardhannâthjï cult.</page><page sequence="33">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 33 54 All sources agree that Vallabha, in spite of Sri Nâthjï's special call, first went to Mathurä before he visited Govardhan. In Mathurâ he had a holy bath in the Jamna and a Brähmana called Ujägar, of the Caube sub-caste performed the rites of the tïrtha for him. It is not said that he visited any shrine in particular, not even the famous shrine of Kesavdev (cf. BLF p. 203). 55 We see that Vallabha had already the status of a prestigious 'Acärya' when he arrived in Braj. According to the CW (värtä 83, p. 478) he went to Govardhan accompanied by five disciples: Dämodardäs Harsäni, Krsnadäs Meghan, Mädhav Bhatta, Näräyandäs and Rämdäs Sikandarpurvâre (from Sikandarpur, this epithet made him distinct from his namesake Rämdäs Cohan from Braj mentioned in Transi. § 16). Rämdäs Sikandarpurvâre was also known as baro Rämdäs, 'the great (or older?) Rämdäs'. 56 As a Brähmana and a strict Vaisnava, Vallabha would not touch any food but from the hands of one of his own caste or from an initiated Vaisnava. It is said that Krsnadäs Meghan was a Khattri (actually the name of a merchant caste) from Soron and one of the very first disciples of Vallabha. In the CW, his biography comes second, just after the biography of Dämodardäs Haxsänl. 57 It is not quite clear from the text whether Saddüpände and the other Brajväsls devotees - all of them belonging to the pastoral castes (see note 16) - did receive the full Vallabhite diksä, later known as brahmasanbandhan, or a simpler form of diksä known as nâma-diksâ, as in the case of Kumbhandâs (cf. supra note 36). Actually the Brajväsls seem to have been relegated from the start to an inferior position within the sect, cf. infra note 63. 58 There is a discrepancy here between the account found in the SNPV and in the CW (värtä 1, p. 4): according to the latter, Vallabha, while pondering on the vision he had had in the forest and on the order he had received from Sri Näthjf to grant brahma-sanbandhan to many people, went to Gokul. There, on the Govind-ghät, he sat on a comtarä (cabùtarà) built under a large Chomkar (= Samï) tree, in the vicinity of a temple dedicated to Sri Dvärkänäthjf. As he was sitting there he got another vision of 'Sri Thâkuijï' who assured him that all those to whom he would confer the initiation would be purified thereby. This happened on the 11th day (ekädasl) of the bright half of Srävan, the sole witness of the marvel being the disciple Dämodardäs. Yet in the same CW, in the värtä 83, pp. 358 ff (narrating the biography of Saddüpände), the story is told more or less as in the SNPV. The other account (as in CW värtä 1) appears definitely later. 59 Literally 'there is no embracing the pusti-märga''■ this is the first time that the SNPV refers to the specific name of the sect founded by Vallabhäcärya. The exact meaning of the statement seems to be that, without having had an opportunity of watching the performance of the Vallabhite ritual, a conversion to the doctrines of the Pusti-märga, which alone entails salvation, is hardly possible. It is certain that the dazzling brilliance of the Vallabhite performances of sevä to Sri Nâthjï exerted a strong attraction on the Hindu people of the time and must have won many converts to the new faith. 60 According to CW, värtä 47, p. 272, the first shrine erected by Vallabha was only kacco chotoso mandir, 'a kind of small raw shrine' (i.e. built with light material, a kind of temporary structure, probably without walls) - but a proper pedestal was necessary in order to make the performance of sevä possible. According to the Gaudiya tradition, it was Mädhavendra Purï who had first erected that pedestal for Sri Govardhannäthjf. " This Rämdäs is said to be bhagavadïya, 'devoted to Bhagavän' (Visnu-Krsna). In his case, the term vaisnava is not used as it was for Mädhavendra Puri (see supra note 42). Four 'Rämdäs' are mentioned in the CW: Rämdäsji Sarasvat, a Southern Brähmana (värtä 7); Rämdäs Samcorä, a Gujarâtî Brähmana (värtä 33), Rämdäs Mevärä, a Brähmana apparently from Mewar in Rajasthan (värtä 47) and Rämdäs Cohan, also called 'Rämdäs purohit' (värtä 48). According to the Bhäva prakäsa commentary on the CW, the hst Rämdäs was a Rajput by caste from Bundelkhand, who had renounced the service of his feudal lord and taken to ascetic life under the influence of a certain Bairâgî (a Vaisnava ascetic) and had taken his residence in Braj (CW, 48, pp. 271-73). As this Rämdäs was not a Brähmana, he knew nothing of sevä, as said in the SNPV, but it seems</page><page sequence="34">34 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE that Vallabha had recourse to him as the first purohita of the newly-established deity, since no Vaisnava Brähmana was available locally after the departure of Mädhavendra Purl. According to the CW, it is only after Sri Nâthjï was installed in the new temple built for Him by Pürnamal Ksattri, some twenty years later, that the sevä of the deity was entrusted to Bengali Brähmanas. The latter were finally expelled from Govardhan by Krsnadäs Adhikârî under the Äcäryaship of Gusâïn Vitthalnâth (CW vârtâ 84, pp. 526 ff.), and were replaced by Gujarâtî Samcorä Brahman as. 62 'Sri Thäkurjl', 'the revered Master' (or 'Lord') is the most common way of referring to the idols of Krsna-Gopäl, as they are worshipped to this day both in shrines and private houses in Northern India. Each Vaisnava home has its 'Thäkurjl', usually an image of the child Krsna playing on his flute (muralidhara). The icon is worshipped mostly by the women of the family and pampered as a living child. 63 The exclusion of the pastoral castes of Braj from all ritual activities concerned with the sevä of Sri Nâthjï and even from the cooking of food to be offered to the deity is clearly indicated here: they could only be suppliers of raw food. Only the devotional singing could be accomplished by 'Brajväsls', the first musician of the sect being Kumbhandäs, appointed by Vallabhäcarya himself, see note 36 and 57. 64 The two episodes clearly belong to local (BrajvasI) lore: they show how for the pastoral people of Braj, 'Sri Devadaman* enshrined or not, had kept the nimbleness and knavishness of a true 'Makhan-cor'. 65 This strange and rather confused story expresses the longing of Sri Nâthjï, now enshrined by Vallabhäcärya and made the object of an elaborate cult, for the simple joy of a cowherd-boy life. He longs to get rid of all the paraphernalia imposed upon him and to be loved and fondled as a simple cowherd child. So He has recourse to a simpleton, whom he finds pasturing his cows in the forest, and persuades him to go up to His own shrine on the Govardhan hill and strip Him of His kingly attire. 66 The expression used here is s'astra kholve, literally 'opening, loosing up his weapons'. The word sastra would fit here if Sri Nâthjï were in the form of a four-armed Visnu, holding his four s'astras or äyudhas, two of which, cakra and gada, are actually weapons. But Srï Nâthjï is two handed and holds no 'weapons'. On the whole, however, the icon's appearance and attire are very similar to those of the Dvärkädhls or Dvärkänäth of Dvârkâ, one of the seven svampas of the Vallabhites. It is likely that the word s'astra here simply refers to Sri Nâthjî's divine ornaments and paraphernalia. The implication is that these ornaments and paraphernalia actually displeased Him, as they concealed his svarùpa, 'essential Form' as a Cowherd lad. It may well be that the pastoral population of Braj somewhat resented the monopolizing of their 'Devadaman' by the Vallabhite sectarians. 67 The jhagâ is a kind of loose shirt, the only garment normally worn by a small boy. 68 This story appeau as a landmark in the development of the Sri Nâthjï cult outside Braj. The boy is the first Brähmana convert to the new faith, and, like Vallabha, he is said to have received a direct call from Sri Nâthjï Himself. " About the cult of the 'Thâkurjîs', see supra note 62. The boy belongs to a respectable Madhvite Vaisnava family, who pay respect to all 'Thâkurjîs', (probably of the more common, 'Murlldhar' type). But Thâkurjîs like Sri Govardhannâthjî, in the govardhana-dharana (and not muralidharana) attitude must have been unknown outside the Braj area at the time. 70 The boy is not only converted to the new faith: he is claimed by Sri Nâthjï as his own and, though born a Brähmana, turned into some kind of 'honorary cowherd', to take place among Sri Nâthjî's own cowherd companions. So he is lost to his family and cut away from his own lineage. Sri Nâthjî's grace and his own devotion make him into a 'BrajvâsT and there is no mention of his initiation into the Vallabhite sect. In this episode, as in the preceding one (§ 19), the tension between the two groups of devotees can be felt. 71 Cf. Bhakta-mâl, Rüpkalä ed., Lucknow, 1937, chappay 167, pp. 864—65. That Premnidhi ('Treasure of Love') is said to have been remarkable by his kindness to all and his exemplary</page><page sequence="35">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 35 detachment, though he never left his home in Agra. A dohä is quoted to underline the fact that great holiness can be achieved at home as well as in the forest. The Bhakta-mâl does not say anything about his sectarian affiliation; there is no mention of his being a Madhvite either in the prose commentary (vârttik tilak) which follows the stanza. Nothing is said about his giving up his own son to Sri Nâthjï, but his sanctity as a layman is emphasized: "What matters is to remain attached in spirit to the feet of Räma and Sita, whether in the forest or at home". n The bountiful gift of Mändaliya Pände's daughter-in-law to Devadaman results in bringing a marvellous blessing on the latter's house, which is visited by Sri Nâthjï. It also gives the deity a good opportunity for celebrating His own birthday, the Krsnajanmâstamï (on the eighth day of the dark fortnight of Bhädra). Among the pastoral castes, the birth of Krsna is celebrated with a kind of rough game, in which young cowherd lads scramble for a huge jar of butter or curds, stuffing themselves and stuffing the others'mouths with it, smearing their faces with it, and finally throwing it all around. It is to this kind of celebration that the quoted line by Kumbhandäs refers. 73 This Caturänägä, said to be a bhagavadbhakta is the same personage mentioned above as the guru of Dharmadäs (see Transi. § 7 and note 35). His sectarian affiliation is not known though the name itself suggests a 'naked' ascetic. He is not mentioned in the CW and from this passage of the SNPV it is clear that he was unwilling to climb the Govardhan hill. Nevertheless his reputa tion for holiness must have been great since he is called a mahâpurusa and Sri Nâthjï himself comes from Sri Giriräj to pay him a visit. Svâmî Sri Caturânagan. or 'Nâgacaturdâsjï', is men tioned in the Bhakta-mâl (chappay 148, p. 825) where he is represented as a wandering ascetic inflamed with a passionate love for Lord Krsna, wandering through the whole of Braj and the city of Mathurä, 'his sweet words giving joy to all' ; moreover it is said that 'in order to strengthen the supreme Dharma (paramadharma) he worshipped the Sriguru as God' - but who this Sriguru was is not clear. 14 This curious detail about Sri Nâthjï entering the dense thickets of the Tond forest mounted on a buffalo and followed by his closest disciples probably evokes one of the attempts made by the Vallabhites to protect their most sacred idol from Muslim raids. This seems to have been the case even before the persecution by Aurangzeb (from 1668 A.D. onwards) at which time Sri Nâthjï was taken away and progressively carried to Näthdvärä in Mewâr where the idol has remained to this day. It is said in the Caitanya Caritamrta, Madhya, 18, w. 22 ff. that when Caitanya arrived in Govardhan, 'Gopäla' i.e. Sri Nâthjï was no longer on the top of the hillock: the villagers had hidden Him in the Gàrhthufi village, as they were informed that the Turks were coming to plunder. So it was in that village that Caitanya met 'Sri Gopäl' of Govardhan; when Sri Gopäl returned to his hill shrine, Caitanya did not want to go up out of respect for the sacred hill. The CC clearly says that 'out of fear of the Mlecchas, Gopäl ran away again and again and left his temple to take refuge in woods or villages' (Madhya 18. v. 27). 75 Though Caturänägä is neither a Brähmana nor a Vallabhite, Sri Nâthjï does not hesitate to accept a cooked meal (bhoga) from his hands. In another circumstance, according to SNPV § 30, Caturänägä goes to Govindkund to offer a meal to Sri Nâthjï and Sri Nâthjï Himself comes down from the hill to consume [the food. It may be that Caturinâgâ's refusal to go up to the hill shrine of Sri Nâthjï was inspired by the same scruple as that of Caitanya himself, who did not want to place his foot on the sacred hill for fear of desecrating it, so that Sri Nâthjï Himself had to come down to meet him. (Madhya 18, w. 20-21 and sloka 4). 76 This ironical poem by Kumbhandäs can only be understood in reference to the 'running away' of Sri Nâthjï to the Tond forest, in fear of the Muslims (cf. supra note 74). Hiding in fear in a thorny bush was rather unbecoming to the valourous and glorious Sri Govardhannâthjï, who had lifted the Govardhan hill by the strength of His arm! Kumbhandäs goes as far as insulting Him in jest, suggesting that He could no longer be distinguished from a miserable wretch, an intouchable Dhedh (the lowest of the low), "son of a 'widow' (or 'harlot') Dedhnï!" 77 The precision with which this date is given in the SNPV indicates that it must have been some important landmark for the Vallabhites - probably the date at which the enforced exile of Sri Nâthjï in the Tond forest ended and He could safely resume His residence on the Govardhan hill temple. It seems that this time Sri Näthii was able to persuade Caturänägä to accompany Him</page><page sequence="36">36 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE III. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CULT OF éfU GOVARDHANNÀTHJÏ IN THE VALLABHITE TRADITION The first part of the Éri Nâthjî präkatya värtä [SNPV] translated in the preceding paper (GNIII) deals with the following events: (a) The miraculous emergence of the 'risen Arm' of àrf Nâthjï out of a rock-cave of the Govardhan hill and the devotion it aroused among the local inhabitants (corresponding to SNPV translation § 1). (b) The manifestation of the 'Lotus Mouth' (mukhärvinda) of the same deity at the same place, the latter event being concomitant with the 'manifestation', i.e. the birth of Sri Vallabhäcarya on earth and the spreading of the cult of $rï Nâthjï, locally worshipped under the name of 'Devadaman' (corresponding to SNPV translation § § 2—7). (c) The arrival in Braj of the Bengali (Gaudïya) Vaisnava ascetic Mädhavä nand, alias Mâdhavendra Pun, and the aborted attempt by the latter at establishing the cult (sevd) of the newly-found deity on the Govardhan hill, pending the arrival of Vallabhäcarya himself (corresponding to SNPV transi. §§ 8-10). (d) The manifestation of Srï Nâthjï and his Vyühas, his order to ârî Àcâryajï (Vallabhäcarya), the latter's arrival in Braj, the instalment of 3rï Näthjf s svarüpa idol and the establishment of his sevä (correspond ing to SNPV translation §§ 11-16). (e) The fast spreading of the cult of &amp;rî Nâthjï in the land of Braj (corres ponding to SNPV translation §§ 19—22). In the first part of the SNPV, the narrator apparently relies mostly on local legends, i.e. the pastoral Brajväsl tradition, concerning the circumstances of the manifesta tion of Érî Govardhannâthjï out of the holy hilf and the subsequent establishment of his cult by the Bengali Vaisnava ascetic Mâdhavendra Pun. Yet the writer, being a member of the Vallabhite establishment, already introduces sectarian views, such as the refusal of the deity to be fed by Mâdhavendra Pun and his preventing the latter from establishing his sevä, a role that the Vallabhite tradition reserves for Vallabhäcärya. Such sectarian views appear somewhat clumsily interwoven with Brajväsl lore and religious sensibilities: the SNPV account suggests that the local people experienced some difficulty in accepting the metamorphosis of their hill and forest deity, wont to assume the shape of a cowherd lad to run over the country side and play tricks on his worshippers, into a motionless Thäkurfi, pompously</page><page sequence="37">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 37 attired in royal garments and fed on delicacies prepared by supercilious Brahmin cooks with elaborate rituals. The second part of the SNPV, corresponding to §§ 25—37 in our translation, covers the period from the foundation of the new temple of àrT Nathjf by Pürnamal Khattrï in 1501 A.D. to the accession of 3rï Vitthalnâthjl, alias Sri Gusainjf, to the gaddi of the sect in 1553' A.D. It was left to Vitthalnäth to give the Pusti sampradäya sect its full development and to establish it on a firm basis, both theologically and in its organization. According to the SNPV, the establishment of the äcäryaship of Srf Gusainjf coincided with the forcible expulsion of the Bengali priests from the service of Sri Nâthjf by Krsnadâs Adhikârï. The dismissal of the Bengali sevakas from the Govardhan temple seems to have been the last and final step taken by the Vallabhites to ensure their total control over the cult of ârï Govardhannâthjf and the Govardhan-ksetra, whereas the Gaudfyas developed their implantation in the Vrindäban area. Translation of the SNPV § 23. Pùrnamal Ksattn is ordered to build a temple In the year Samvat 1556 [A.D. 1499], on Caitra sudî 2, in a dream, Srr Näthjr ordered Pùrnamal Ksattn to build a large temple in Braj for him.1 § 24. Arrival of Pürnamal Ksattri in Braj Taking all the necessary materials from Ambaläy, Pürnamal Ksattri arrived at Sri Govardhan in the Braj country. Upon arrival, he asked where was that Sri Devada man Thäkur he had heard about.2 Then one-Brajvasî showed him the spot and, when he had had the dar&amp;an of Sri Govardhannäthji, he was overjoyed. Later on he went to meet Sri Äcäryaji and, after prostrating himself before him, he told him: 'O Mahäräj ! It appears that it is the wish of Sri Govardhannäthji that a large temple be built for Him: He Himself has ordered me to do so in a dream. This is why I have come here with the necessary material.' Then Sri Âcâryajï with his blessed mouth gave his approval: 'Yes, yes, quickly build a temple.' He then told Sri Giriräj: 'When they build the temple, they will open cracks in your rock: will You allow it?' Sri Giriräj too gave His permission, saying: 'Sri Näthjl is present in my very heart, so I won't mind their cracking my rocks. Do proceed with the building as you please.'3 § 25. Discussions over the plans of the temple There was an architect called Hirämani who lived in Agra. àrïji appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to come and build a temple for him. So Hirämani went to</page><page sequence="38">38 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE Srî Govardhan and he asked Sri Äcarya Mahaprabhu permission ot build the temple. As Hïrâmani was about to lay the foundations, SrT ÄcäryajT asked him to draw the image of the intended temple on paper. Then Hlrämarji drew a sketch of the whole temple and he showed it to Sri Äcäryajr. When the latter saw that the plan included a iikhara, he ordered HIrämani to draw another plan. When he saw that the second plan also included a iikhara, he asked for a third. When he saw that the third plan also included a iikhara, 3rî Àcâryajî finally gave his consent and he told £rl Dämodaiji: 'Sri Näthji wants a temple with a sikhara: as a result, after He has stayed for some time in the temple, the Yavanas will raid it. Then ârïjï will emigrate to another country where He will remain for some time and then He will return to Braj and another temple will be built for Him in the vicinity of Puchrl.'4 There are three iikharas on &amp;rï Giriräj: 'Âdi-àikhar', 'Brahma-sikhar' and 'Dev fcikhar'. On the first one, Àdi-àikhar, He [Giriräj] sported at the time of the Krsna avatâra; on the middle one, Dev-àikhar, He is now sporting — and when His sports come to an end, he will be sporting on Brahma-àikhar. Âdi-àikhar and Dev-àikhar are now hidden in the ground, the Brahma-âikhar alone remains visible. He himself is 3rï Govardhannâthjî - therefore, as such, He Himself is for ever sporting on 5&gt;rî Govardhan.5 § 26. Beginning of the new temple In this way, with the permission of àrf Âcâryajï, in the Samvat year 1556 [A.D. 1499], on Vaiàâkh sudï 3, in the naksatra Rohinï, a Sunday, the foundations of the new temple were laid.6 One lakh and a few thousands more coins were at the disposal of Pürnamal. After he had spent one lakh of gold coins on the temple, Pürnamal took whatever was left and departed for the South. There he bought precious stones which he resold for a value of three lakhs of gold coins. Twenty years later he came back and with the value of those coins he completed the build ing of the temple. During all that time the temple had remained half-done and the deity had remained in the old shrine. Since 5&gt;rï Nâthjî was eager to sport with the Brajvâsls, during all these twenty years Rämdäs Cauhän Räjpüt had continued to perform His sevä.1 Thus from the Samvat year 1545 until the Samvat year 1576 isrï Näthji went on sporting in every way. § 27. Enthronement of Érï Näthfi in the new temple When the building of the great temple was over, 3rï Àcâryajï Mahäprabhu, having completed his world parikramä, came back to Braj. Finding the temple ready, S&gt;n Äcärya Mahäprabhu enthroned 3rï Näthji therein in the Sarhvat year 1576 [A.D. 1519] on Vaiââkh sudï 3, the day of aksaya trtîyâ. [.. . ]</page><page sequence="39">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 39 [Extreme joy expressed by Pürnamal. He received the blessings lavished upon him by Vallabha cärya and departs for his home town.] § 28. Establishment of the 'sera' of Érl Näthji After Pürnamal's departure, 5&gt;rï Âcâryajï Mahäprabhu called Saddupände and told him: 'Now that a large temple has been built for Sri Govardhannathjl, there will be need of many priests (sevakas). You yourself are a Brahman8 and a great expert in the Castras, and it is fitting that the sevä of the Lord be performed by Brähmans'. Saddupände replied: '0 Mahäräj, in our caste, we have no knowledge of either doctrine or rites. You should appoint those who understand something about sevä. At Srf-kund, there are some Vaisnava Brähmans who are the sevakas of 3ri Krsna-Caitanya9 : it would be a good thing if you appointed them'. There upon 3rï Acäryajf entrusted the sevä of 3rï Näthjf to those Bengali Brähmans, after having explained to them the rites of that sevä. He appointed Mädhavendra Purl as the Head-Priest and put his disciples in charge of performing the sevä}0 To Krsnadäshe entrusted the over-all responsibility11 and to Kumbhandâs the duty of performing the devotional singing.12 Then he made an enduring endow ment 13 in favour of Saddupände: Whatever food the priests would offer to 3ryî daily was to be handed over to him afterwards as his due. Whatever surplus food was brought in, the priests should offer it to the God and then they could make their own living out of that mahäprasäd.14 He recommended them not to omit any of the daily celebrations in honour of 3rï Näthji: if, through the grace of the Lord, they got a surplus, they might keep it, provided Srï Govardhannâthjï Himself did not object to it and they had made all the necessary offerings at the appointed times. Having thus ordered, 3rî Acärya Mahäprabhu departed for another world parikramä. § 29. Offerings of cows to Érî Govardhannathjl One day before Sri" Àcâryajf left for his world parikramä, Srf Govardhannathjl told him: 'Bring me a cow.' — 'All right', said Sri Àcâryajf. Then he told Saddupände: 'Sri Govardhannathjl" wants a cow. I own this leaf of gold: for its price, bring Him a cow.' Saddupände replied with a prayer: '0 Mahäräj, all the cattle, all the cows and buffaloes in my house are already yours! Nothing of mine is mine any more: just tell me how many cows 1 should bring!'. But Sri Äcäryajl said he did not want to present Sri Nâthjî with cows given by Saddupände, since it was to himself that Sri Näthjl had given the order. Therefore Saddupände sold the gold and brought a cow which he placed in front of Sri Nâthjî and the God was very pleased. Later on all the Brajväsls, hearing that Sri Näthjl was indeed very fond of cows, began to offer Him cows: some brought four, some ten, some only one and they presented them all to Him so that He got thousands of cows. Therefore Sri Äcäryajl called</page><page sequence="40">40 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE ârîNâthjl Gopäl 'Cowherd'.15 And He was celebrated as such in a poem composed by the pious Chitsvâmî:16 'Cows in front and cows behind, cows here and cows there Govind enjoys living amongst cows! With cows He runs, in cows He finds delight and He covers His own body with the dust of their hooves! Staying in Braj amongst cows, He has forgotten the Vaikuntha; for the sake of the cows He lifted the Govardhan hill! Say Chitsvâmï, that Giridhar, that Vithales has assumed the form of a Cowherd to live amongst cows! § 30. Ên Nâthfï goes to Govind-kund to have a meal One day it so happened that Caturänägä went to Govind-kund.17 There he prepared bread and cooked an elaborate meal to be placed before ârï Nâthjî as His midday meal. At the same time, on the hill itself, Mâdhavendra Purl had placed the midday meal (râjbhog) before 3rî Nâthjî. Yet the God left it and went down to Caturänäga's place at Govind kund - but, as the amount of food prepared by Caturänägä was not sufficient for His appetite, [after He came back to the temple] He told Mâdhavendra Purî: 'I am hungry! Bring back my midday meal' and it was brought back to Him. §31. Éri Nâthjî is displeased with the service of the Bengalis Mädhavendra Puri used to dress 3rî Nâthjî every day with a crown and a loin-cloth. On feast-days only he used to decorate the God's turban with ornaments but every day he applied sandal-paste to His body. All this did not please &amp;rï Nâthjî.18 Yet, since Mädhavendra Purl had been appointed to His service by Àcâryajï Mahäprabhu himself, He did not protest against it. In this way the Bengali priests remained in charge of the sevâ of Sri Nâthjî during fourteen years. Sometimes they used to seat a svarüpa idol of goddess Vrndä by the side of érïjî, which He disliked.19 Therefore He told Avadhütdäs to tell Krsnadäs: 'Those Bengalis are always stealing my own things! Do expel those Bengalis!' § 32. The demise of Éri Acärya Mahaprabhu At that time, in the Samvat year 1587 [A.D. 1530], on the Tlj after Âsâdh sudî 2, at midday, 3rl Äcärya Mahâprabhu entered the Gangä at Hanumän Ghât at Kâsï, and then, taking the padrmsana posture, he went to his [heavenly] abode. § 33. Éri Gopinâthjî, elder son ofÉri Äcäryaji, ascends the gaddi Then &amp;rî Gopinâthjî, the elder son of £rï Àcâryajï Mahâprabhu, ascended the gaddi</page><page sequence="41">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 41 and for three years he ran the sevä of Sri Nâthjï. During those years the sevd con tinued to be performed by the Bengali priests and Sri Gopinâthjï had ornaments made for Sri Näthjl for a lakh of rupees. § 34. The fate of Sri Purusottamji Then Sri Purusottamji, son of Srï Gopinâthjï, entered the rock-cave of Sri GirirâjjT: then érîjî caught hold of him with His own hand and made him share bodily in His own lilä, so that Sri Purusottamji disappeared for ever. § 35. The demise of Érî Gopinäthfi Aggrieved by the loss of his son, Sri Gopinäthjr lost heart. He left Braj and went to Érî Jagannäthdev at Purï. There he reabsorbed himself into the svarùpa idol of Sri Baldevjî and so resumed his original form.20 § 36. The accession of Sri Vitthalnäthjl and the dismissal of the Bengalis Sri Äcäryajf Mahäprabhu had two sons: the elder one, Sri Gopinäthjr, who gave himself up to 5&gt;n Jagannäthdev and the younger one, Sri Gusainjï, alias Srï Vitthalnäthjl, who acceded to the gaddl. It was the latter who had the Bengalis priests removed from the service of Sri NäthjL21 Knowing this to be the wish of ärijf, Sri Vitthalnäthjl appointed some Gurjara Brähmans to perform His sevd22 and he made all of them perform the sevd under the leadership of Rämdäs.23 § 37. On Érijî's order, Mädhavendra Pun leaves for the South in search of sandalwood ârïjï commanded Mädhavendra Purl to go and fetch pure sandalwood from Malaya giri for His own use, as He was very found of sandal. Therefore Mädhavendra Purï left for South India in search of sandalwood.24 NOTES 1 The first shrine erected by Vallabha was but a fragile structure, cf. GNIII, note 60. Ac cording to the Vallabhite tradition, this event had taken place soon after the arrival of Vallabhäcärya in Braj, in S. 1550 [A.D. 1493], cf. Kanthamani Shastri, Känkarolikäitihäs, Kânkarolï, S. 1996 [KI], p. 32. 2 Thäkur or Thäkurfi, lit. 'Master', in Krishnaite usage refers to an idol of Krsna-Gopäl, es pecially for domestic worship. Each Vaisnava and some non-Vaisnava households have their own Thäkurfi, which is often the private property of the mother of the family. These idols are usually images of the child Krsna in the tribhanga pose holding a flute and sometimes flanked by Rädhä, called Thäkuräni 'Mistress'. The term Thäkurfi for the Sri Govardhannäthji idol appears for the first time in the SNPV in the passage in which Vallabhäcärya gives instructions to Rämdäs about the sevä to be performed for Sri Nâthjî; cf. GNI II, Transi. § 16 and note 62. 3 This passage seems to establish a distinction between the sacred hill itself, Êri Girirâf, and the</page><page sequence="42">42 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE deity Sri Näthji, the latter being supposed to dwell within the heart of the former. This is in keeping somehow with Vallabhite belief but opposite to the primitive belief in the identity of the two, a belief which still prevails in the Bengali (Gaudïya) tradition. According to the Caitanya caritämrta of Krsnadäs Kaviräj (Madhya 18. w. 15-18 and 23-33), Caitanya himself never wanted to set foot on the holy hill which he viewed as Krsna-Gopäl's own body. Instead, soon upon his arrival at the foot of the Govardhan hill, he embraced a piece of rock (ekä älä) detached from the hill, with deep devotion. The Gaudïya Gosvâmîs of Vrndäban, Rüp and Sanätan, did not trample on the sacred hill either. The SNPV attributes the same scruple to Caturänägä, a Vaisnava ascetic established near Jatlpura (old Gopälpur) cf. infra, note 17. 4 The prediction evidently refers to the destruction of the temple built by Pürnamal, which was razed by Aurangzeb in A.D. 1749. The new temple probably refers to the Sat svarüpom kä mandir 'The temple of the Seven Svarüpas' [of the Vallabhite sect] now found near Jatlpura, an important centre of the sect. Vallabhäcärya's reticence was founded on the fear of offending the Muslim rulers who, even when they were relatively tolerant, would not allow the tower of a pagan temple to rise in the sky as if to defy the local minarets. All Vallabhite temples to-day, known as havelis 'palaces' i.e. are private shrines secluded within the high walls of a palatial building. 5 This paragraph apparently reflects local (Brajväsl) beliefs about the character and habits of the deity of the Govardhan hill: temple or no temple, under the form of a cowherd lad (Gopal) the deity would roam freely over the sacred hill to which He was identified. The 'peak' on which He had once manifested Himself at the time of the Krsna-avatära had disappeared for ever and the one on which He was now playing ('Dev-éikhar', a name reminiscent of the old name 'Devadaman') was now hidden under ground — which amounts to say that, according to local belief, the Deity of the hill had now become invisible, but He would reappear at the end of this Kali age and make Himself manifest on the only 'peak' now to be seen, 'Brahma-s'ikhar'. 6 The date given in the SNPV (S. 1556) agrees with that given by Kanthamani Shastri (KI p. 49) but differs from that ascribed by P.B. Mitai (BSI p. 112): S. 1559 [A.D. 1502]. According to Mital the temple was still unfinished when Vallabhâcârya proceeded to the installation of Sri Nâthjï in its precincts in S. 1564 [A.D. 1507]. The building was only completed in S. 1716 [A.D. 1519]. P.D. Mital's chronology appears more probable as there must have been a lapse of time between the arrival of Purnamal Ksattrî in Govardhan and the moment when the building of the temple actually started. 7 This Rämdäs Cauhän had been in charge of the sevä of Srî Govardhannâthjï ever since the image had been installed by Vallabhähäcärya in the temporary shrine (cf. GNIII, Transi. § 16 and note 61). According to Kanthamani Shastri (KI p. 49), that Rämdäs or Räghavandäs stayed at Apsara-kund, an old pond surrounded by dense vegetation near the village of Puchrï, where a rock-cave, known as Rämdäs kiguphä, is still to be seen. While in charge of the cult of Sri Nâthjî, Rämdäs used to bathe every day at the Govind-kund (near Anyaur), said to be the very place where Indra had performed the abhiseka ceremony for Krsna after the latter's victory. Anyaur (annaküta-gräma) and Jatlpura (yatipura Sillage of the Yati': Madhävendra Purl ?), also known as 'Gopälpur', contain the most ancient relics and primitive tTrthas connected with the cult of the Govardhan hill, including the famous Srigiriräj kä mukhärvind 'Lotus Mouth of Sri Giriräj': a simple crack in the rock which is still worshipped on the day of the Annaküt festival with enormous amounts of food, the festival being locally known as Kunwâdâ. 8 This is the first time in the SNPV narrative that Saddu Pände is called a Brähman, though his title of Pände suggests that he was so (cf. GNI II, notes 16, 27, 57). Had Saddupände and his brothers really been Brähmans, Vallabhâcârya would have had no need to entrust the sevä of !&gt;rï Näthji to the Räjpüt Rämdäs Cauhän. As to the Mathurä Brähmans known as Caube (caturvedl), they were and are Smärta Brähmans and not reckoned as Vaisnavas. So the only Vaisnava Brähmans available in the whole area were the Gaudïya (Bengali) Brähmans, disciples of Caitanya, and these had to be called from Rädhä-kund. 9 Srî-kund clearly refers to Sri Rädhä-kund, a famous tirtha situated four miles away from</page><page sequence="43">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 43 Govardhan, at the North-eastern extremity of the hill, in the vicinity of the Arît (arista) village. There, in a paddy-field, Caitanya Mahäprabhu himself had rediscovered the twin ponds named after Krsna and Rädhä, said to be the very place where the divine lovers used to indulge in water-play. This rediscovery is narrated at length in CC Madhya 18. w. 1-7. According to Mital, this event took place in S.1573 [A.D. 1516]. Soon after, the place became the first centre of the Gaudiya sect in Braj. 10 The appointment of Mâdhavendra Puri, Caitanya's ädiguru, by Vallabhäcärya as mukhiyä 'Head-priest' of the Srï Nâthjî temple after its completion is not only improbable in itself but also anachronical: the accepted dates of Vallabha are A.D. 1479-1530, whereas those of Mâdhavendra Purï are A.D. 1420-1490 (cf. F. Hardy, JRAS, 1974, p. 40). All sources agree in making Mâdhavendra Purï the true initiator of the new cult. According to the SNPV however Sri Nâthjî himself did not allow Mâdhavendra Purï to carry on with his self-imposed duty, as He Himself wanted to wait for the arrival of Vallabhäcärya in Braj for the establishment of His own sevâ, cf. GNI II, SNPV Transi. § 8 and notes 39 &amp; 44. Another Vallabhite source, the Caurâsï vaisnaväm ki värtä, gives more details about the appointment of the Bengali Brähmans by Vallabhäcärya in the Krsnadäs ki värtä (translated in R. Bartz, The Bhakti sect of Vallabh äcärya, Thomson Press (India), 1976, pp. 212-13). According to the CW, Vallabhäcärya entrusted the sevä of Srï Govardhannâthjï to twenty or twenty-five Bengalis and granted them permission to build their huts on the lower slopes of the Govardhan hill. But the CW does not mention the appointment of Mâdhavendra Purï as Head-priest. The two texts contradict each other also about the duration of the office of Rämdäs Cauhän. According to CW 'when the new temple was finished, Rämdäs Cauhän the Räjpüt left his earthly body and entered into [divine] lilä; then the Bengalis were left in complete charge of Srï Govardhannâthjï.' According to SNPV, the Bengali Brähmans remained in charge for fourteen years after the completion of the temple until they were forcibly expelled by Krsnadäs Adhikârï, under the Äcäryaship of Vitthalnäth who replaced them by some Guijara Brähmans. He re-appointed Rämdäs as the sevakas' Head-priest, while Mâdhavendra Pun himself was sent away to the South under the pretext of fetching sandalwood, (cf. Transi. § 36 and notes 23, 24). 11 adhikâr k'i sevâ 'the service of responsibility'. This Krsnadäs was a Kunbï from Gujarät, therefore a äüdra by caste, and could have no share in the ritual sevâ of the deity, but he was a capable man and he was put in charge of the over-all management of the temple establishment as adhikâri, his main activity being the collection and the management of the temple funds. The CW shows him as an astute manager but also as a dishonest and dissolute man. He apparently nursed a strong dislike of the Bengali sevakas whom he compelled to quit in a most ruthless manner, soon after the demise of Vallabhäcärya and the accession of îsrï Gusainjî, alias Vitthalnäthjf to the gaddi of the sect; cf. infra note 22. 12 About that Kumbliandäs, nephew of Dharmadâs, cf. GNI II, SNPV Transi. § 7 and note 36. 13 The expression used here: nega bandhyo shows that Saddupände and his descendants were made into negi 'hereditary servants' of Srï Nâthjî: their neg or hereditary privilege consisted in the exclusive right to the precious mahäprasäd, the food which had been put aside after being actually 'fed' to the deity and was therefore looked upon as the left-over of 3rï Näthjl's own meal. 14 In Näthdvärä and in other Vallabhite centres, this surplus food cooked at the temple and presented to 3rï Nâthjî is the property of the priests (sevakas), who offer it for sale to pilgrims on small booths set up near the haveli. 1 s According to CC, Madhya 4, v. 41, Éri Gopäl was the name under which the deity of the Govardhan hill introduced himself, in the garb of a cowherd lad, to the Vaisnava ascetic Mâdhavendra Purï, who was to unearth his forgotten image and set it up on the hill. This accounts for the old name of Jatïpuia: Gopälpur. Probably until the arrival of Vallabhäcärya in Braj, the deity was usually referred to as Devadaman by the local people and it was Vallabhä cärya who called him !&gt;ri Govardhannâthjï or Éri Nâthjî; cf. GNI II, note 31. 16 Chitsvâmî is the last of the 'Eight Seals' (astachäp), the eight poets said to have been either</page><page sequence="44">44 CHARLOTTE VAUDEVILLE Vallabha's oi Vitthalnäth's disciples. Chitsvâmï belonged to the second group, together with Kumbhandäs, Caturbhujdäs and Govindasvâmï. 17 About Govind-kund, cf. supra note 7. Caturänägä is already mentioned as a great bhagava diya in the SNPV, cf. GNI II SNPV Transi. § 22 and note 75, where it is said that Sri Nâthjî Himself had gone to the Tond forest to visit Caturänägä 'who had never set foot on mount Giriräj' (about that refusal, cp. supra note 3). The Bhakta-mäl of Näbhäjl (chapter 148) calls him ÉriSvämi CaturäNagana-, according to the Bhakta-mäl, he was a great Vaisnava devotee, 'night and day absorbed in adoration', Vandering through the city of Mathurä and the Braj countryside, bringing bliss to all'; 'in order to establish the supreme religion (parama dharma) he worshipped his venerable guru, Paramänanda, and his sweet, attractive speech brought happiness to the Lords' servants in all places: the Saints and the eminent devotees of the Eternal One spread his fame at all time.' According to Dindayal Gupta, Astachâp aur vallabha sampradäy 2nd ed. Prayag, 1970, p. 232, Kumbhandäs' uncle, Dharmadäs, was a disciple of Caturanagan or Nägä Caturdäs. This assertion, based on the Belvedere Press edition of the SNPV, is not found in the Nâthdvârâ edition. This Caturänägä, whose floruit is given as 1480 A.D., was definitely a pre-Vallabhite saint, probably one generation before Mädhavendra Purl himself. It appears that his ecstatic love and mellifluous words made a lasting impression in the whole country of Braj. To-day, in the Tond forest near Jatîpura, is found the samädhi of Caturänägä, marking the spot where the saint is said to have died. (We are grateful to Professor L. Pollet of Leuven University for information on Caturänägä). 18 Apparently the kind of sevä performed by the Bengali priests was considered by Krsnadäs Adhikäri and probably by 3rî Gusainjî himself as too primitive and not luxurious enough for a majestuous king such as Sri Nâthjî. Moreover, being a Northener, Sri Nâthjî could not appreciate 'cooling' sandalwood paste being applied to His body all round the year - even in winter - as though the climate of Braj was equally hot all round the year as in the South. This particular grievance is more clearly expressed in another passage in the SNPV, dealing with the biography of Mädhavendra Purl. 19 The CW account (cf. Bartz, ibid. p. 217) adds the precision that the Bengali priests used to seat their devï by the side of Sri Nâthjî when offering food to Him - which implies that both were being fed side by side as if of equal standing, in the way Rädhä is worshipped along with Krsna in the Gaudïya mode of worship. Actually the Vallabhites themselves attribute to Krsna a divine consort whom they call Sri Svâminïjï, sometimes identified with Rukminl, Krsna's first queen (as in the case of the 3ri Vitthaleèjï svarûpa idol), but more often identified with Rädhä. Barz is probably right in stating that 'it was Vitthalanâthajî who increased the place of Sri Svâminïjï and the mädhura bhäva in the Vallabha Sanipradäya, probably under the influence of the Caitanya Sampradäya' (ibid. pp. 89-91). Nevertheless, whether identified with Rädhä or not, in the Vallabhite mode of worship Sri Svâminïjï is never entitled to stand by the side of Her Lord and to share a meal with Him: when she appears by His side, it is in the humble, devotional attitude of a wedded wife or of a Gopî-worshipper. What the Vallabhite tradition emphatically rejects therefore is not Rädhä but the iakti status accorded to her in Gaudïya theology and actual practice which put her on an equal standing with Krsna. The SNPV says that the devï surreptitiously introduced by the Bengalis, who placed her by the side of Sri Nâthjî, was Vrndà devï - a rather improbable suggestion designed to make Sri Näthjfs alleged protest against the devfs presence more acceptable to Vallabhite sensibilities. 20 Gopînâth, Vitthalnäth's elder brother, is supposed to have been an avatar of Baldev or Balräm, Krsna's elder brother. It was therefore fitting that he should go to Jagannâth Purî to re-absorb himself into the idol of god Balräm enthroned with his younger brother Jagannâth (identified with Krsna) and his wife Subhadrä. 21 According to Kanthamani Sastri (KI p. 86 ff.) the expulsion of the Gaudïya priests from Govardhan took place under the äcäryaship of Sri Gopînâthjï, but the latter, a retiring person ality, was already sharing his authority with his younger brother. It is said that in Samvat 1590 [A.D. 1533] both brothers took the svarûpa of Sri MadanmohanjI (a Venugopäl image) from a</page><page sequence="45">THE GOVARDHAN MYTH IN NORTHERN INDIA 45 certain Näräyan Bhatt, to whom the idol had been entrusted by Vallabhäcärya, with the in tention of giving it to the Bengalis for worship in exchange of Sri Govardhannâthjî - but the Bengalis priests refused. Then Krsnadäs Adhikâri took the matter in hand and resorted to a particularly nasty trick to get rid of the Bengalis and burnt their huts. The CW (Krsnadäs kl värtä, translated in Barz, op. cit. pp. 207 ff.) gives a vivid narrative of the whole affair. The aggrieved Bengalis went to complain to their own gurus, the Gosvämls Rüp and Sanätan, then at Mathurä, where a violent quarrel broke out between their party and Krsnadäs Adhikâri escorted by a troup of armed Brajvâsls. The Vallabhite party had more influence at the Moghul court so that the quarrel was finally settled by the emperor Akbar in their favour: they remained in possession of 5&gt;rl Govardhannâthjî, whereas the Bengalis accepted the Sri Madanmohanjî svarüpa as a compensation. The latter svarüpa idol which the Bengalis took to Vrndâban is said to have been the very svarüpa which had been served by 3ri Gopïnâthjî. There must have been two distinct svarüpas of that name, since a 'Sri Madanmohanjf, said to have formerly belonged to Illamägäru, Gopinäth and Vallabha's mother, is still to be found in Kâmban as the property of the sixth ghar of the Vallabhite sect, that of Ghaniyäm (a son of Yadunäth), according to Barz, op. cit. p. 55. 22 According to KI p. 86, both brothers wanted to entrust the sevä of 5&gt;rï Nâthjî to men of their own caste, Telugu Brâhmans, but the latter refused. The motive of the refusal is not stated. So they had recourse to some inferior Brâhmans, the 'Samcorä' (or 'Samcihâra') Brâh mans, a sub-caste of Brahmin cooks from Gujarat to take over the sevä from the Bengalis. 23 Presumably this Râmdâs was the same Rämdäs Cauhän who had been appointed by Vallabh äcärya as S&gt;ri Näthjfs Head-priest, cf. supra § 26 and note 7. 24 Actually Sri Nâthjî was fed up with Mädhavendra Puri's insistence on applying sandalwood to His body all round the year (cf. supra § 31 and note 18) and the mission He entrusted to Mädhavendra was just a pretext to do away with his services in a decent and respectful manner. Mädhavendra Puri was to remain in South India and never to return to the land of Braj. At this point of the narration, the SNPV introduces a long story dealing with the life and achievements of the great Vaisnava saint Mädhavendra Purï, stressing the tender feelings which existed between him and Vallabhäcärya, the founder of the Vallabhite sect. On the whole the Vallabhite accounts of Mädhavendra Puri's biography widely differ from the Gaudîya accounts, especially those found in the Caitanya-caritämrta of Krsnadäs Kaviräj.</page></plain_text>
