<plain_text><page sequence="1">Internal Realism, Human Nature, and Distributive Justice: A Response to Martha Nussbaum CHRISTOPHER BOBONICH University of Chicago In a series of recent papers, Martha Nussbaum sketches the outline of an ambitious and provocative 'Aristotelian' theory of distributive justice. Here I shall concentrate on the aspects of Nussbaum's proj- ect which seem to me to hold the greatest philosophical interest and set aside questions of interpreting Aristotle as well as specifics of Nussbaum's disputes with contemporary 'relativists'.l Instead, I shall focus on the distributive theory that she puts forward and on her views about how to justify it.2 The details of Nussbaum's theory of distributive justice are some- times difficult to pin down, but the view seems to run roughly as fol- lows. The first element of her theory is an account of the essential features of human beings, that is, an account of "what seems to be part of any life we . . . count as a human life" (p. S55). These essen- tial features turn out to be "limits" (such as mortality) and certain basic capabilities for engaging in various sorts of activities and un- dergoing various sorts of experiences (such as capacities to engage in planning and deliberation and the capacity to feel pleasure and I would like to thank Dan Brudney, Alan Gewirth, Richard Kraut, and Ian Mueller for valuable discussions of Nussbaum's talk. None of them, of course, should be as- sumed to endorse any of my views. 1. Nussbaum acknowledges debts to Hilary Putnam and Amartya Sen; it seems to me that her theory has more in common with their views than with Aristotle's. (Nussbaum's theory is not necessarily any the worse for this.) The egalitarianism and universalism of her theory as well as its pluralistic conception of the good and its commitment to 'inter- nal realism' are all, in my view, important differences from Aristotle. 2. I have drawn freely on recent papers by Nussbaum besides the one published here. This should cause no problems since Nussbaum holds that they are consistent with this paper and, in many instances, deepen and clarify her views. ? 1993 by The University of Chicago.

This list, Nussbaum claims, provides a minimal theory or conception of the good (p. S58).4 More precisely, with regard to each of the basic human functional capabilities we are to define a threshold level of "good functioning." To take an example, one essential feature of human beings is hav- ing a body which needs food, drink, and shelter. The corresponding "basic human functional capabilities" are "being able to have good health, adequate nourishment, adequate shelter" (p. S58). We can now partially specify a minimal theory of what the good for human beings is by fixing the minimal levels of health, nutrition, and shel- ter that a human being needs in order to function "well" or to lead a "good human life" (p. S57).5 Finally, the third part of Nussbaum's theory is a principle of distributive justice-that is, a principle for the just distribution of society's goods and resources in light of the minimal theory of the good. Each of these features of her theory requires some sort ofjustifica- tion. Nussbaum, besides developing a substantive theory of distribu- tive justice, is quite concerned with how to justify ethical claims and theories. Drawing on the work of Hilary Putnam, among others, Nuss- baum rejects the doctrine of "metaphysical realism" which she char- acterizes as the view that "there is some determinate way the world is, apart from human history and human interpretations" (p. S50). Re- ality, she claims, is partially dependent on human interpretations, 3. Nussbaum sometimes emphasizes the "open-endedness" and revisability of any such list of essential features (e.g., p. S55), but it is not clear how far she wants to go here. Does she, e.g., want to claim that there is no (nontrivial) property which must be included in a true or ideally justified account of human nature or merely that any list we come up with here and now is revisable? 4. The relation between essential features of human nature and basic human func- tional capabilities is not spelled out and seems to be complex; for the basic human functional capability that is associated with the essential property F is not merely the ability to F. For example, the basic human functional capability corresponding to the essential property of mortality is "being able to live out a complete human life, as far as is possible; not dying prematurely or before one's life is so reduced as to be not worth living" (p. S58). 5. It does not matter whether we say that the threshold is functioning well or the ca- pability to choose to function well as long as we remember that Nussbaum aims at mak- ing citizens capable of choosing to function well. We can describe this as making them capable of choosing to cross the threshold in the first sense of threshold or as bringing them across the threshold in its second sense. I shall not discuss the "threshold of capa- bility to function, beneath which a life will be so impoverished that it will not be human at all" (p. S57), since Nussbaum holds that it is the threshold level of "good functioning" that is relevant to distributive justice. S75</page><page sequence="3">MODERN PHILOLOGY and the only adequate conceptions of truth and knowledge hold these in turn to be dependent on human cognitive activity within his- tory.6 Once we have this metaphysically moderate understanding of reality, knowledge, and truth, Nussbaum thinks we shall realize that values are part of reality and can be known. We can discern values not by trying to get outside all human practices and conceptual frame- works but by exploring our ways of thinking and acting "from within," by "the deepest examination of human history and human cognition" (p. S50). (Thus the name "internal realism.") Although Nussbaum usually discusses internal realism insofar as it applies to essential hu- man properties, if she is to ground the other two parts of her theory she must also think it possible to give an internal-realist account of the human good and of the principles of distributive justice. In recent years, a number of philosophers have been drawn to simi- lar positions. Versions of moral realism which hold that values can satisfy the only appropriate standards there are for objectivity have become increasingly common. Nevertheless, defenders of moral real- ism have often not offered much detail about how to discover and justify moral values in the face of disagreement, or about what values we shall discover once we give up a false metaphysical picture. Since Nussbaum attempts to supply this sort of detail, a careful examina- tion of her project may help us to understand the prospects of de- veloping and justifying a moral theory within the internal-realist framework. Here, due to practical constraints on the length of a re- sponse, I can only offer a brief survey of the three main elements of Nussbaum's theory and close with some general remarks about the prospects for similar projects. ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF HUMAN NATURE The concept of human nature that Nussbaum defines seems to cap- ture neither our ordinary notion of a "human being" nor the notion of a "person" or "moral person."8 It seems, rather, to combine features 6. I am paraphrasing the original version of the paper delivered at the symposium. This is a rough statement of a complex position, and it should not be pressed too hard. 7.

Her emphasis on the "concrete and determinate" nature of her conception of the human being and the corresponding S76</page><page sequence="4">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum of both although Nussbaum does not attempt to justify this particu- lar combination. For example, we can imagine dolphins, gorillas, and Martians composed of silicon who would satisfy her criteria and thus would count as "human beings." Our ordinary intuitions might, I think, count these as "persons" but not as "human beings." (Even folk- tales which attribute sophisticated mental lives to animals tend to see them as not "one of us"-i.e., as nonhuman.) On the other hand, Nussbaum's criteria are sometimes so strict that they rule out not only beings who would clearly count as "persons" (e.g., ones who lacked needs for food and drink or shelter or who felt no sexual needs and desires) but also rule out beings who would seem to count as human on our ordinary criteria (e.g., a being who lacked a capacity for "humor and play" or a capacity for feeling that it owed "some re- spect and concern" to other species and to nature [p. S56]). But we might be able to work these difficulties out and, as I shall shortly argue, questions about the essence of human beings are not as im- portant for Nussbaunm's project as she makes them. There are, in any case, further problems for her theory. Obvi- ously, conceptions of distributive justice are quite controversial: even within contemporary American society, they are hotly disputed and the disagreement only heightens when we include participants from other cultures and other times. Is Nussbaum's theory capable of resolving such disagreements? We might hope to, as follows. (I do not know whether Nussbaum would argue this way, but it is one plausible strategy for meeting her need to resolve or adjudicate dis- agreements.) Although particular distributive principles are contro- versial, we can avoid these controversies by trying to secure broad agreement on the essential features of human beings. This theory of human nature, once developed, will be so appealing to many people that they will be willing to revise their judgments about distributive principles when they see that their previous judgments are incom- patible with principles flowing from the theory of human nature. Although the foregoing line of argument is vague as it stands, it does seem to have some appeal. There certainly would be widespread agreement that human beings need food and drink to survive, be- cause of the way they are. Kantians, utilitarians, virtue theorists, and deontologists of all sorts would agree, moreover, that the fact that human beings need food and drink in order to survive is morally criticism that the "person' is "a vague moral notion" fit awkwardly with her insistence that her list of essential features is open-ended and revisable. Also, tying "human being" to notions of kind-membership and of species suggests that Nussbaum may want to limit "human being" to the species Homo sapiens although her actual list of essential features does not seem to do this. S77</page><page sequence="5">MODERN PHILOLOGY important and that it grounds, in some way or another, various moral duties and requirements. But there are problems. First, it is hard to understand why Nussbaum is so concerned with the question of essential properties. Why does it not suffice, for the purposes of dis- tributive justice, that human beings actually need food and drink? What further moral relevance is there to the claim that they need food and drink in all possible worlds, and how would the fact that in some other possible world human beings could survive without food be relevant to the principles of distributive justice which hold for the actual world? (The claim that human beings need food and drink in all possible worlds may, in fact, be more controversial than the claim that their actual need for food and drink is morally relevant.) Sec- ond, the foregoing line of argument depends on the idea that princi- ples of distributive justice flow from the theory of human nature. But as we shall see shortly, Nussbaum's theory of human nature in terms of capabilities and limits does not determine and, in fact, only weakly constrains theories of the human good.9 The links between an ac- count of human nature and distributive principles are even more tenuous and, as we shall see, Nussbaum shows no such connection. Thus even if we could secure widespread agreement on her list of es- sential human features, the most important parts of her theory would remain in need of justification. But as we shall also see, her list of essential features will itself be quite controversial. This controversy will be exacerbated by two other features of her view. First, the theory is extremely broad, perhaps unlimited in scope: it applies to all human beings at all times or at least to very many hu- man beings in very many cultures at very many times (pp. S54-S55).10 The second feature concerns her conception of justification. On her view, the list of essential features of human nature is to be justified by appealing to "the commonness of myths and stories from many times and many places" or to "a wide variety of self-understandings of peo- ple in many times and places, [to] the stories people tell them- selves."11 It seems to me that Nussbaum consistently underestimates the difficulty of justifying her list of essential features with these resources. 9. Other theories of human nature may constrain theories of the good more strongly-e.g., ones which see humans as detached parts of the godhead who long for rejoining or as beings who by nature desire to know or to maximize pleasure. 10. I assume Nussbaum thinks that if a theory of distributive justice applies to a soci- ety, it should be justifiable, in some not too attenuated sense of 'justifiable', to the members of that society. 11. Martha Nussbaum, "Aristotelian Social Democracy," in Liberalism and the Good, ed. R. B. Douglas et al. (New York, 1990), p. 217, and "Social Justice and Universalism," in this issue, p. S54. S78</page><page sequence="6">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum Consider one instance. Claiming mortality is one of the essential features of human life, Nussbaum characterizes it as follows. "All hu- man beings face death and, after a certain age, know that they face it.... Although in some circumstances death will be preferred to the available alternatives, the death of a loved one or the prospect of one's own death is an occasion for grief and/or fear" (p. S55). "If we encountered an immortal anthropomorphic being . . we would judge . . . that the form of life was so different from our own that the being could not be acknowledged as human."l2 This claim is, I think, surprising. What has happened to all the "myths and stories from many times and many places" (including many of the ancient Greeks) which claim that we are essentially immortal beings, that is, that we are or have immortal souls? Such stories and myths are quite common throughout Western history; they are still widely believed in many contemporary societies. Nussbaum, moreover, does not even try to show that she can legitimately exclude them from con- sideration. Thus, on Nussbaum's own understanding of justifica- tion in terms of appealing to "the commonness of myths and stories from many times and many places," her claim that human beings are essentially mortal seems unjustified. Similar problems apply to other features on her list, but let me mention only one other impor- tant instance.13 Nussbaum seems to hold that there is just one hu- man nature for all people regardless of, for instance, race or sex and that there are no natural racial or sexual differences which have a substantive effect on what is good for individuals.'4 (I shall refer to these as "gender-neutral" or "race-neutral" conceptions.) For ex- ample, I assume that Nussbaum would reject the idea that women's nature determines their good to consist in staying at home and nur- turing children. Yet myths and stories from all over the world and from many times claim that there are fundamental natural differ- ences between men and women and that these differences make it 12. Nussbaum, "Aristotelian Social Democracy," p. 224. By the claim that we are "mortal," Nussbaum clearly means that our span of existence is finite and is limited to this earth; she intends to rule out the possibility of a transition, preserving our identity, to an infinitely long life. 13. Note her casual claim that "it is characteristic of human life ... to prefer sexual desire and its satisfaction to a life with neither desire nor satisfaction" (p. S57). Impor- tant Western and non-Western traditions with ascetic tendencies will reject this claim. The fact of disagreement does not show that Nussbaum is wrong about what is essential to all possible humans in all possible places at all possible times, but she tends to under- estimate disagreement. 14. This claim is, no doubt, cruder than Nussbaum's actual view, since she would, e.g., hold that access to prenatal care is good for pregnant women in a way that it is not good for men. I shall not attempt to refine the claim since it does not affect my point in the text. S79</page><page sequence="7">MODERN PHILOLOGY the case that what is good for men and women is quite different. It will not help Nussbaum here to claim that even these stories recog- nize women as human, since the stories claim that although men and women are both human, the natural differences between them affect the good of each and the sort of rights, opportunities, and so on that each should have. How, then, can Nussbaum justify her account of human nature in light of such disagreement? 1. Nussbaum emphasizes that actual universal agreement is not necessary; this seems right. (We could not get actual universal agree- ment even on the laws of logic.) But this point does not affect the is- sue at hand since the views I have just mentioned are obviously too widespread to be dismissed as aberrations; they are not minor or ob- scure traditions. Thus the question remains: how do we settle serious disagreements on Nussbaum's view? If we cannot achieve unanimity, what about plurality? Nussbaum does at one point say that she is seek- ing "a broadly shared, general consensus" (p. S54). Leaving difficul- ties about this formulation aside, I still have two concerns.15 First, with regard to her specific claims about human nature, the question whether most myths and stories reflect or embody them is largely an empirical one that cannot be settled here. Nevertheless, it seems doubtful to me that Nussbaum will find her secular and gender- neutral view of human nature the subject of a broad consensus of "myths and stories from many times and many places." We might well think that such a conception of human nature is true or correct, al- though it has been very much the minority view for many centuries and even now may still be a minority view in Western liberal democra- cies. But it would be surprising to find that this is what most human beings at most times have actually believed. Second, why does Nuss- baum give such a fundamental role in justification to myths and sto- ries? At least some of us today would think that most (or even the vast majority) of myths and stories were produced by individuals who not only held racist, xenophobic, and sexist beliefs but also suffered from grave ignorance of various important psychological and physiological truths. (For example, many myths portray humans as subject to pos- session or intervention by gods or spirits or claim that various forms of illness are signs of wickedness.) Why should we take their agree- ment to reliably indicate the truth about human nature? Or is Nuss- 15. Is this a consensus among myths and stories or among people? Is this a consensus of people living at a time (in which case essential human properties may change over time) or are we supposed to try to imagine what consensus there would be among all people at all times? S80</page><page sequence="8">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum baum's thought the more radical one that their agreement is constitutive of truth? (Would it still be constitutive if most people thought that such agreement was not constitutive of the truth?) Inter- nal realism does not commit one to treating myths and stories as reli- able indicators of the truth or as constitutive of it; Nussbaum owes us a precise account of the role she is attributing to myths and stories and ajustification of this role.l6 2. Perhaps Nussbaum thinks that we could employ philosophical or scientific arguments to show that the stories of immortality or of rele- vant natural differences between the sexes or between races are false. She does not mention this possibility, and it is unclear how it would fit with her explicit reliance on "myths and stories from many times and many places." If she would allow scientific or philosophical theories to enter as "myths or stories" to be taken into account,17they would nevertheless seem to have no privileged position from which they could override other myths and stories. I do not think it would be im- possible for her to give science or philosophy such a privileged place while remaining an internal realist, but she seems not to do so and cer- tainly provides no argument that would support such a move.l8 3. We might think that we could resolve such disagreements among myths and stories by finding the area of agreement between conflicting views. (Note that this is not a procedure that Nussbaum adopts in the case at hand: she simply claims that we are mortal.)19 In the case of the mortal/immortal dispute, we might argue that both sides accept the death of the body as an essential aspect of human life. Since they then disagree over whether an immortal soul survives, all reference to a soul should be omitted from our characterization of human nature. Although compromise is tempting, this version of it is crude and unworkable. First, if we omit any feature on which there is (significant) disagreement, the resulting account will be quite 16. At least on H. Putnam's view (see, e.g., Reason, Truth and History [New York, 1981], and "A Defense of Internal Realism," in his Realism with a Human Face [Cam- bridge, Mass., 1990]), truth is identified with or cashed out in terms of idealized justifi- cation, not "a broadly shared, general consensus." Thus both the present consensus and the general consensus of many times and many places may be wrong. 17. At one point, she claims that her list has a "general nonmetaphysical character" and appears to recommend avoiding philosophically controversial issues (Nussbaum, "Aristotelian Social Democracy," p. 220). In another essay, she seems to give no privi- leged place to scientific or philosophic theories (Martha Nussbaum, "Aristotle on Hu- man Nature and the Foundations of Ethics," in a volume on the philosophy of Bernard Williams, ed. R. Harrison and J. Altham [Cambridge, in press]). 18. The acceptance of 'internal realism' does not, I think, rule out this possibility al- though Putnam, at least at times, may reject it (Realism with a Human Face, pp. 184-85). 19. But cf. Nussbaum, "Aristotelian Social Democracy," p. 220. S81</page><page sequence="9">MODERN PHILOLOGY impoverished; in fact, different points of view may not be able to agree on a theory-neutral description of so-called basic phenomena. (What I see as a human body, you may see as the temple of the Lord.) More important, it is unclear what implications such compromises have for our understanding of the human good and proper distribu- tive principles. In the present case, would it follow that the concep- tion of the human good should make no reference to what is good for an immortal soul, and distributive principles should not distribute re- sources so as to further the good of such souls? Some of us might find this outcome acceptable as long as people were allowed to use their resources and capabilities for religious purposes. But why should a dedicated believer accept these characterizations of the human es- sence and human good as anything more than a modus vivendi?20 She might think that agreement could be reached on no other posi- tion and prefer this to no agreement, but still think that the agreed- upon positions are false or omit important truths and thus comprise a poor basis for moral principles. The inadequacy of this sort of compromise is clarified even more by the following case. Suppose one party believes that only men are by nature benefited by engaging in freely chosen activity outside the home, while the other party believes that this is true of both sexes. The area of shared agreement would seem to consist in holding that men are capable while making no judgment on women's capabilities. But what conception of the human good and what sort of distributive principles follow from this compromise, and why should we accept these as true or as a good basis for moral principles rather than, if anything, as a modus vivendi? Note that in some cases, even if both parties agree that a group possesses a certain essential feature, one side might deny that we should promote the good functioning of the group with respect to that feature. Thus some Christians might think that there is no point in fostering pleasure, sexual satisfaction, and physical health without fostering spiritual health, and we might think that promoting the opportunities of men without also promoting the opportunities of women is unjust. Again, the examples do not show that all processes of finding shared agreement will have these prob- lems, but we have not yet seen how to avoid them. 4. Finally, Nussbaum might simply point out that all justification ends somewhere and that, for her, the account she gives of human nature stands in need of no further justification.2' While such a move 20.

S82</page><page sequence="10">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum is always open, it seems arbitrary here and, more important, would foreclose the hope of achieving a wide consensus across many cul- tures and many times.22 Let me emphasize what I am not arguing: that disagreement over any of the three elements of Nussbaum's theory shows there is no right an- swer to the dispute. All I am claiming is that her theory of justification does not give us a promising way of resolving such disagreements. THE "THICK, VAGUE CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD" The second part of Nussbaum's theory involves specifying with regard to each of the basic human functional capabilities a threshold level of "good functioning," that is, a threshold "beneath which those charac- teristic functions are available in such a reduced way that, though we may judge the form of life a human one, we will not think it a good human life" (p. S57). She calls this a "thick, vague conception of the good." "The Aristotelian uses a conception of the good that is not 'thin,' like Rawls's 'thin theory'-that is, confined to the enumera- tion of all-purpose means to good living, but 'thick'-dealing, that is, with human ends across all areas of human life. The conception is, however, vague and this in a good sense. It admits... of many con- crete specifications; and yet it draws, as Aristotle puts it, an 'outline sketch' of the good life. It draws the general outlines of the tar- get. ... It does real work."23 On the possibility of alternative specifi- cations, Nussbaum comments as follows: The political plan, while operating with a definite conception of the good at a vague level, operates with a sufficiently vague conception that, while much is ruled out as inappropriate to full humanity, there is a great deal of latitude left for citizens to specify each of the components more concretely, and with much variety, in their lives as they plan them.... Corresponding to each of the vague functions there is an indefinite plurality of concrete specifications that may be imagined, in accordance with circumstances and taste. .. . Specification may be 22. Elsewhere, Nussbaum remarks: "The fact that any given human being might have lived anywhere and belonged to any culture is a great part of what grounds our mutual recognitions" ("Aristotelian Social Democracy" [n. 11 above], p. 220). I am not sure how this argument is supposed to go, but reliance on this alleged "fact" is troubling since it commits Nussbaum to a highly controversial metaphysical position-i.e., to de- nying the thesis of "necessity of origin," which claims (roughly) that having the origin that she in fact did have is a necessary property of every person. (Compare Saul Kripke, Naming and Necessity [Cambridge, Mass., 1980]; and Derek Parfit, Reasons and Persons [New York, 1984], pp. 351-55.) If Nussbaum is trying to avoid metaphysical commit- ments, why make this one? 23. Nussbaum, "Aristotelian Social Democracy," p. 217. Compare p. S54. S83</page><page sequence="11">MODERN PHILOLOGY either individual or communal: societies too may choose among available options for instantiating a particular function. But very often the society's history, traditions, circumstances, and other ends will make the appropriate choice rather more circumscribed.... "Local specification" . . . differs from "plural specification": in plural specification the idea is one of choosing from among a plurality of available options, in accordance with tastes: in local specification the idea is one of finding the appropriate way of instantiating a certain function, given awareness of one's traditions, circumstances, etc.24 I shall be brief here since I have already canvassed similar problems in the first section, and Nussbaum herself has less to say on this issue. First, we shall again have to face the question of disagreement and of Nussbaum's resources for resolving it. We should, I think, expect far more disagreement over what is good for human beings than over questions of essential human properties. Even if we could arrive at a satisfactory list of essential properties, the fact that I am, in virtue of my nature, capable of doing F (or likely to do F) does not entail that it is part of my good to do F. (For example, let F be "engage in sadistic practices" or "act out my oedipal complex.") On the other hand, sup- pose that human nature is such that humans cannot do F. This might show that we should not require people to do For include doing Fin our account of the human good, but this does not show, for instance, that it is not part of the human good to try to do F.25 And even if we were to accept Nussbaum's own list and, for example, the claim that exercising my essential capacities to perceive and to reason is part of my good, this does not tell me in what way I should exercise these capacities or how to fit them in with other activities. Islamic funda- mentalists, Stalinists, samurai warriors, medieval Christian monks, and contemporary radical lesbians might agree that it is an essential feature of human beings to use their senses and minds and to move about, but they are, unfortunately, quite likely to disagree over how people should use their minds and senses and over the ends for which people should move about. In sum, at the most general level, Nussbaum faces the following di- lemma. To the extent that her conception of the good becomes more determinate, she will run into the problem of increasing disagree- ment. It seems to me that John Rawls is right in claiming that the 24.

But this reading is controversial; see Martha Nussbaum, The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek Tragedy and Philosophy (New York, 1986), pp. 293-317, 373-79; and Richard Kraut, Aristotle on the Human Good (Princeton, N.J., 1989), pp. 65, n.45; 161, n. 1. S84</page><page sequence="12">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum existence of a "plurality of conflicting, and indeed incommensura- ble," conceptions of the good is now a feature of the culture of mod- ern democracies and that it will not "soon pass away."26 Nussbaum will have to resolve much more widespread and intense disagreement since her theory is not limited to modern democracies but is to apply to all or very many cultures. I do not see much reason to hope that such disagreement can be settled by appeal to "the commonness of myths and stories from many times and many places," and Nussbaum does not give us anything else to go on here. On the other hand, to the extent that the conception of the good becomes less determinate and there is much local and individual variation, Nussbaum's project comes close to Rawls's: providing "all- purpose" or at least multipurpose means for varied conceptions of the good life.27 As we have seen, Nussbaum criticizes and rejects this feature of Rawls's theory, but it is hard to see how she can do so with- out offering a conception of the good which is implausibly determi- nate, given her justificatory resources. (If we see her project as that of directing government to provide the means for varied conceptions of the good life, we can still make good use of one of her most interesting proposals: that government concentrate on developing capabilities in the citizens and not merely on distributing resources to them.)28 A final point concerns Nussbaum's recognition of individual varia- tion. If she allows quite a bit of individual variation, it is no longer clear how much work is being done by the essentialist theory of hu- man nature. If an individual is to have a determinate conception of the good, she will need to specify the ways in which she will exercise her human capacities and the trade-offs she will make among the various possible human functionings. If these matters are properly determined by the informed preferences of the individual, what nec- essary work is being done by a theory of human nature?29 On the other hand, there is good reason to think that the range of possible 26.

This has been an important theme in Sen's work. See Martha Nussbaum, "Nature, Function, and Capability," Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy, suppl. (1988), p. 153, n. 11. 29. Perhaps Nussbaum could argue here that the conception of an informed prefer- ence is somehow based on an account of essential human properties, but I do not know if she would want to make this argument or how it would go. S85</page><page sequence="13">MODERN PHILOLOGY lives open to individuals will be fairly sharply limited, due to Nuss- baum's stringent principles of distributive justice. She holds that dis- tributive justice requires the massive redistribution of resources, and we shall see in the next section that the consequences of her princi- ples are probably more radical then she allows. Her theory of distrib- utive justice is likely to involve such heavy demands on the time, energy, and resources of individuals that many common conceptions of the good life will be ruled out as unjust. DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE I shall focus here on the following three questions: 1. What is the scope of Nussbaum's distributive principles? 2. What are the criteria of a proper distribution? 3. What is to be distributed? Nussbaum says she wants to provide "a fully international account of distributive justice," that is, one that regulates the distribution of goods and resources across the entire world (p. S50). She, however, provides no justification for this universalist assumption which is in sharp conflict with many widely held views, current and past, about what people of one country or state owe to people of different ones. It is usually thought, even in contemporary Western societies, that what we owe to those who are not our fellow citizens or countrymen is refraining from harming them (e.g., through aggression) and at most some very weak duties of positive assistance in extreme emergencies; we are not obligated to make the same sacrifices for them that we are for our fellow citizens. The universalist assumption is thus quite con- troversial and will conflict with many widespread views. It may, of course, still be possible to vindicate universalism, but Nussbaum does not attempt to do so, and it is hard to see how she could succeed if all she can appeal to is a transcultural and transhistorical consensus.30 So what distributive criterion does Nussbaum endorse? Her ulti- mate goal requires "moving all of [the citizens] across the threshold into capability to choose well,31 should the available resources at all 30. The mere fact of increasing interdependence will not suffice. We still have to fill the gap between this fact and the universal moral requirement and fill it in such a way, e.g., to avoid incurring the most stringent moral obligations to those with whom we trade the most. 31. We may gloss this as "capability for good functioning." I regret that I do not have the space to discuss Nussbaum's view of the importance of choice. At one point she ar- gues: "One of the capabilities Aristotelian government most centrally promotes is the capability of choosing. . . . Leaving this place for choice is an absolutely essential part, for the Aristotelian, of promoting truly human functioning, in every sphere. In short: S86</page><page sequence="14">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum permit this. The focus is always on getting more to cross the thresh- old, rather than further enhancing the condition of those who have already crossed it."32 Nussbaum's idea has some appeal for many of us, since one widespread intuition is that 'basic needs' take priority over other social objectives and, in particular, take priority over the desires or preferences that arise after basic needs have been met. (Another way of putting a similar point is that helping the worse-off takes priority over helping the better-off.) Nevertheless, some prob- lems remain. To begin, Nussbaum seems to be offering a lexical or- dering of her distributive principles: first maximize the number of people above the threshold and then fulfill some other goal(s).33 But what other goals are we then to try to achieve? Are we to maximize overall well-being,34 bring each person to an equal level of good functioning (or to a state in which each has the capacity for the same level of good functioning) or to do something else? Until this is made clear, the distributive principle remains quite vague. Also troubling is Nussbaum's suggestion that one major advantage of her view over utilitarianism is that the trade-offs between the good of one person and that of another which utilitarianism requires are "problematic."35 the person who is given a clean water supply can always put pollutants in the water she drinks.... The government aims at capabilities and leaves the rest to citizens" (Nuss- baum, "Aristotelian Social Democracy," p. 214). Suppose the government has suc- ceeded in removing pollutants from the water. On Nussbaum's view, it seems to follow that the government will have failed in one of its most important aims unless it gives to each individual the opportunity to reintroduce pollutants to the now-pure water. This is at least counterintuitive. It is not clear to me whether Nussbaum thinks that choice is valuable only insofar as it contributes to or promotes happiness or well-being. If she holds that choice does have independent value, her position is both quite different from that of Aristotle and in need of more defense than she gives it. 32. Ibid., pp. 216-17. Compare pp. 228-29, and Martha Nussbaum, "Reply to David Charles," Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy, suppl. (1988), p. 214. Nussbaum also en- dorsed the threshold principle in her symposium presentation. 33. If Nussbaum is committed to maximizing the number of people over the thresh- old in all cases, this will have some unpalatable results. If "the focus is always on getting more to cross the threshold," then if n people are just below the threshold and the only way to get anyone across it is to push n-l people far below the threshold, Nussbaum would be committed to making this reduction. Since she does not unequivocally en- dorse maximizing the number of people over the threshold in all cases, I shall leave aside questions of the effect of maximizing the number of those over the threshold on those who remain below. 34. Compare Nussbaum, "Reply to David Charles," p. 214. 35. Nussbaum's views about trade-offs are complex. See, e.g., "The Discernment of Perception: An Aristotelian Conception of Private and Public Rationality," in her Love's Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature (New York, 1990), pp. 54-105. It is hard to tell whether Nussbaum thinks that there often are genuine moral dilemmas or whether she thinks that there is always a right answer to the question of what trade-offs we should make, but that some trade-offs should be made regretfully. S87</page><page sequence="15">MODERN PHILOLOGY Now despite finding such trade-offs "problematic," she requires us to make some: that is, those which benefit people below the threshold at the expense of people above it. And we may also have to make trade- offs within the group of those below and within the group of those above the threshold.36 We may have to choose whether to allocate a given amount of resources to benefiting this group or that group, both of which are below the threshold. Nussbaum, however, suggests no criteria for making these decisions.37 Leaving these complications and difficulties to one side, let me con- sider two objections to the simple threshold view. First, maximizing the number of those above the threshold will be fantastically expensive and burdensome.38 Any expenditure of resources (and money is only one of these), no matter how great, will be required as long as it brings another person across the threshold (or perhaps closer to it).39 Any sacrifice of the well-being or capacity to function of any number of those above the threshold (as long as it leaves them above) will be re- quired in order to bring one person across. Such a program will re- quire a vast redistribution of resources and impose extremely heavy demands on the time and energy of almost all individuals. (We could almost always bring another person across the threshold by increasing medical care and research, spending evenings with the handicapped, and so on.) Certain ways of life and their allied institutions would seem almost certain to disappear since they consume resources which could be used to bring more people across: only special pleading could allow art galleries, museums, and humanities institutes to be funded by the government or even to survive under such principles. 36. Perhaps maximizing the number of people over the threshold will usually uniquely determine all distributions, and, if not, we might count all that are consistent with maximization as just. 37. Perhaps what Nussbaum ultimately objects to are trade-offs which improve the position of the better-off at the expense of the worse-off. Banning all such trade-offs would require us to maximize the position of the worst-off with respect to basic human functioning. The objections that I raise below to the simple threshold view will also ap- ply, mutatis mutandis, to this view. The requirement to maximize the position of the worst-off with respect to basic human functioning might sound like John Rawls's "Difference Principle," but there are important differences between the two, and Rawls's theory is not as vulnerable to the objections raised below. 38. Important problems arise here: we need a single threshold which takes into ac- count all capabilities to function. (We can think of the threshold as a set of different bundles of capabilities to function.) Fixing the threshold and ordering people with re- spect to it will, it seems, require making a vast number of trade-offs among different ca- pabilities. This is in serious tension with Nussbaum's insistence in her symposium presentation that the separateness of capabilities and their nonfungibility limits the possible trade-offs which can rationally be made. 39. I shall from here on omit the qualifier "or closer to," but the reader should have no difficulty supplying it where appropriate. S88</page><page sequence="16">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum Second, on Nussbaum's theory, all the goods, resources, rights, liberties, and opportunities that society can distribute seem to be subject, without exception, to the threshold distributive principle. She recognizes no rights which guarantee certain liberties or free- doms even when these conflict with maximizing the number of people above the threshold. Her theory will thus require some of the sorts of trade-offs that opponents of utilitarianism have found most objectionable: the theory, it seems, will require us to do some- thing horrible to some in order to bring at least one person above the threshold.40 If, for example, someone without adequately func- tioning kidneys can be brought above the threshold by being given one of mine, it seems that this transfer will be required by the threshold principle (assuming that even with one kidney, I stay above the threshold. Indeed, if the goal is to maximize the number above the threshold, then harvesting all of my organs in order to save ten lives would be required). But also note that since Nussbaum gives no special priority to basic liberties and rights over the distrib- utive principle, she seems committed to trading off the basic rights and liberties of those above the threshold in order to bring about any gain in capability to function that will bring someone across the threshold.41 Thus if the only way to get those above the threshold to work hard enough to support a program of medical care that will in- crease the mobility of those below and bring at least one person across the threshold is to suppress certain basic liberties (e.g., by curtailing the freedom of those above to complain about such pro- grams, abolishing their right to assemble to protest them, burning the works of Milton Friedman, and so on), Nussbaum's theory will impose suppression. The problems get worse when we remember that the threshold principle requires us to give lexical priority to bringing those below the threshold above it: any sacrifice of any number of those above (as long as they all stay above) is required in order to bring just one person across. Further, note that the marginal change required to bring someone who is near to the threshold across it may be very small. We would be required, for example, to make enormous sacrifices of the basic rights and liberties of millions of people above the threshold in order to produce a very small benefit for a single person which is sufficient to bring her across the threshold. I doubt whether many people will find this intuitively compelling. In sum, threshold views, 40. Indeed, the threshold principle seems to be a consequentialist principle. For readers of Nussbaum's recent work, this is surprising. 41. Thus Nussbaum seems committed to more trade-offs than she might like: the threshold principle requires any trade-off that brings at least one net person across. S89</page><page sequence="17">MODERN PHILOLOGY such as Nussbaum's, which give lexical priority to bringing everyone across a threshold have deeply counterintuitive consequences. Even if we were to make some special provision for liberties, thresholds are simply too crude a way of capturing the intuition that helping the worse-off takes priority. In sum, Nussbaum's distributive principle, no less than the other two elements of her theory, stands in need of some justification. It is important to see that this demand for justification does not come only from the moral relativist or the moral skeptic. Even if we accept the idea that human needs have a "moral pull," we have yet seen no reason to accept Nussbaum's threshold principle. But leaving aside the difficulties surrounding that particular principle, how does she think we should go about justifying any principle? It is, I think, obvi- ously unpromising to look for acceptable principles of distributive justice in "the commonness of myths and stories from many times and many places."42 Nussbaum, however, does not tell us where else we are to look or what the standards of success are. The plausible strat- egy of justifying a distributive principle by showing that it accounts for most of the judgments we make about particular cases seems un- likely to work here since particular judgments about proper distribu- tions will vary so greatly across time and cultures. Her task will be especially difficult since she seems to allow no room for local varia- tion in standards of distributive justice: there is only one fully interna- tional distributive principle. PROSPECTS I shall close with a few very brief general observations. First, we have seen that Nussbaum's threshold distributive principle seems to have unacceptable results as it stands: she needs to find some more flexi- ble way to capture the idea that basic needs take some priority over other claims or that helping the worse-off takes priority over helping the better-off. But we might have a more general worry: why does she insist on trying to find one single principle for distributing every- thing? If we look to the actual practices and beliefs of our culture (and all other human cultures of any degree of complexity) we find a rich and complex set of principles and practices affecting and gov- erning how various goods are to be distributed. There is a wide array of different principles (e.g., those invoking effort, merit, need, agreement, luck, and moral goodness) for distributing different goods (e.g., property and wealth, honor, education, health care, po- 42. Nussbaum does not explicitly claim that this is the way to establish a distributive principle, but in light of her silence it seems worth considering. S90</page><page sequence="18">Christopher Bobonich o A Response to Martha Nussbaum litical office, access to legal processes, opportunities for religious and cultural affiliations).43 Why assume that this tremendously rich array of practices should be swept away in favor of one simple principle that distributes everything? Why assume that all these principles and the values inherent in them can be reduced to or replaced by a single distributive principle? Second, Nussbaum has not succeeded in showing that there is a plausible way to resolve disagreement even on what should be the least controversial part of her theory-the essential nature of human beings. It seems to me that there are two ways to go here. First, we might try to develop a theory which would explain why there is dis- agreement. Drawing on modern psychological, sociological, sociobio- logical, neurophysiological, and other such theories, we may be able to explain away certain prominent views of human nature and the hu- man good. We might, for instance, be able to explain the belief in radical natural sexual differences or the idea that a person's true good consists in the ascetic tending of her immortal soul in terms of the desires or repressed wishes of the person holding the belief. If successful, we can explain why certain beliefs are held without invok- ing the idea that they are true: we can explain them away. Such a project would at least face the fact of disagreement squarely, al- though I shall not speculate about the chances of developing and jus- tifying such a theory.44 The other option is to give up, at least in the first instance, trying to find a theory that would be acceptable in many times and many cultures and to try rather to develop one that will be acceptable to us here and now. The disagreements within modern American and European cultures are sufficiently great to make this quite challenging without being so great as to render the project ob- viously hopeless. Whether such a project inevitably leads to relativism and, if so, whether such a form of relativism has unacceptable conse- quences await further inquiry. 43. See M. Walzer, Spheres ofJustice (New York, 1983) for one attempt to describe such complexity. Walzer's view is committed to an unattractive form of relativism, but the recognition of complexity does not by itself commit one to relativism. 44. For example, certain Freudian or Marxist theories may explain away their own rejection in terms of repression or false consciousness. Although any such project faces formidable difficulties, it is not clearly inconsistent with internal realism: explaining away disagreement does not obviously commit one to a belief in a mind-independent reality. 45. In his most recent work (cf. n. 20 above) Rawls sketches this sort of project, claim- ing that it tries to avoid all metaphysical questions including those of relativism and re- alism. Putnam has often been thought to be a relativist and he does, in some sense, make truth relative to a theory, but his position is quite complicated. Compare Ernest LePore and Barry Loewer, "A Putnam's Progress," in Realism and Antirealism, ed. Peter French et al., Midwest Studies in Philosophy, vol. 12 (Minneapolis, 1988). S91</page><page sequence="19">S92 MODERN PHILOLOGY I have offered here much criticism and little praise. Let me empha- size that this is not because I think Nussbaum's work deserves little praise but, rather, because I think that her project is so important and promising that it calls for the closest scrutiny. Indeed, I think that Nussbaurn's project is one of the most important constructive ethical projects since Rawls's. The idea of basing an ethical theory on human nature has attracted Western philosophers from the very beginning of philosophical reflection on ethics, and it is tempting to hope that we can defuse ethical skepticism by showing that ethical theory can meet the demands of a reasonable and moderate account of objectivity. I look forward to seeing how Nussbaum's theory develops.</page></plain_text>
