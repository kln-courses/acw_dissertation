<plain_text><page sequence="1">JANET BROWNE, Charles Darwin. Voyaging. Volume 1 of a Biography. London: Jonathan Cape, 1995. Pp. xvii + 606, illus. ISBN 0-224- 04202-5. ?25.00. One of the contributors to the volume The Darwinian Heritage (ed. D. Kohn, Princeton, 1985) expressed the fear that, although by then Darwin scholars formed a much more compact family than before, increasing specialization within the so-called Darwin industry could lead to a fragmentation of the image of Darwin. According to him, the lack of a good up-to-date biography was less innocent than it might appear, for it might reveal 'the lack of com- munication between some quarters of Darwin studies'. However, he remarked in a more optimistic tone, Darwin studies were in 'a state of ferment, which is best suited for a synthesis, even for a provisional one'. In the space of a few years the ferment produced not one but many such syntheses: Peter Bowler's Charles Darwin: The Man and his Influence (1990), Desmond and Moore's Darwin (1991); from outside the Darwin industry there came John Bowlby's Charles Darwin: A Biography (1990). The publication of Janet Browne's volume confirms that the much-needed synthesis tends to take the form of a biography. It seems that the interplay of family, social, psychological, intellectual and historical factors that determined Darwin's cre- ative life can be properly accounted for only in descriptive form. It must be narrated. Narrative seems to be the up-to-date solution to the old externalist-internalist dispute. Robert M. Young wrote that a biography is not only an invaluable help to understanding the thought of an author, and an antidote against the ahistorical view of science fostered by positivism and analytical philosophy, but it is also 'the central discipline of the study of human nature, culture and society': biography is a 'meta-metadiscipline' ('Biography: the basic discipline for human sciences', Free Associations (1988), 11, 113, 122). Capitalizing on her extraordinary knowledge of the Darwin Archives in Cambridge and other unpublished sources, and making the most of various methodological approaches without in- dulging in any of them unilaterally, Dr Browne has written a well-balanced biography in the traditional sense, where 'traditional' is by no means a disparaging term; quite the contrary: hers is first and foremost a narrative that can be enjoyed also by the general reader. Even the most faithful devotee of Darwin and Darwiniana will find much that is new in it, from funny anecdotes to vivid descriptions of everyday life and intriguing highlights of Darwin's person- ality. Everybody will be amused, for instance, by nine-year-old Bobby's pleading guilty to not washing (see the wonderful letter on p. 28 reporting sergeant-sister Caroline's third degree). We see Darwin delight in cryptolinguistic games (p. 14); mimic, as a student, his Edinburgh professor Jameson (p. 70); become zealous and serviceable to a fault with Henslow (pp. 131-2); and have a snowball fight to celebrate his first New Year's Eve after the voyage (p. 352). We learn that he was capable of inspiring great affection in many people, but also of generating ill feelings in some: as a student, he was sometimes aloof, snobbish, supercilious, quick to take offence (p. 132). He could be forgetful of the generosity extended to him by the captain and crew of the Beagle (pp. 227, 370-1), and brisk and curt as a scientific referee (p. 420). His vitality and enthusiasm for life sometimes verged on irresponsibility, as when he was bravely ready to go to combat, but was disappointed in not seeing any gunfire in Montevideo, or, besides catching birds, shooting, riding and collecting, he looked forward to the thrill of 'a few revolutions' (pp. 217-19). The author is at her best when she describes the interplay of psycho- logical, social and intellectual factors, such as that which led to Darwin's abandoning medicine (and later fuelled the Beagle surgeon McCormick's resentment against him), or the 'Cambridge network' that brought him onto the Beagle. She is particularly successful when she analyses factors whose action was not perceived by the actors themselves, for instance when she exposes Darwin's 'cultural as well as scientific</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 239 chauvinism' and his condescending attitude towards non-British people he met during the voyage (p. 263). She also gives us a most vivid picture of the network of British devotees of natural history all over the world, a network Darwin was well able to exploit. I particularly liked the pages devoted to Darwin's attitude towards nature, and especially animals, at various stages of his life: his cruelty to rats when a child; his unquenchable passion for hunting (on many occasions he seems to have killed for the pleasure of killing: see for instance pp. 204, 331); his carnivorous habits, from juvenile exhibitionism at the Cambridge 'Glutton' Club (where he dined on 'birds &amp; beasts which were before unknown to human palate', p. 107) to his readiness, during the voyage, to try whatever sort of meat he could lay his hands on. Dr Browne is absolutely right in establishing a connection between Darwin's hunting and his collecting, in stressing the 'breezy' and 'robust' character of his approach to nature (Darwin referred to himself as a 'barbarian'), and in pointing out the class and national prejudices that influenced his behav- iour: his 'uncomplicated enthusiasm for life and vigorous disposition' were nourished by the ' unthinking assumptions of superiority' that led so many Britons to confuse exploring with exploiting, collecting and plundering (pp. 219-20, 222, 232). Science became the outer varnish of a self-appointed right to exploit. Although he ultimately came to abhor killing animals, 'compassionate ideas about leaving nature as it was, or of giving a set of specimens to local institutions ... never entered his head' (p. 232). For the sake of his collections he did not hesitate to kill animals with abandon and to maltreat trees (pp. 203, 231). The other side of this patronizing sportsman's attitude was a persistent feeling of admiration for nature, 'enhanced by an easy sympathy with living beings other than himself'. Darwin's 'inbuilt tendency towards anthropomorphism' manifested itself as much in the 'helpless anthropomorphism of a country gentleman' speaking of horses and dogs (p. 383) as in his feeling himself 'part of a single world united by the same kind of mental responses' (p. 216). The German philosopher Dilthey wrote that it is impossible to write the biography of an author without writing the history of that author's age. We find a similar statement in Dr Browne's preface: 'Darwin did not simply sit in the middle of Victorian society soaking up the overriding themes of the age. On the contrary, Victorian society made him... His story is the story of the era ... of the way that someone could take up and turn around the assumptions of the age and become a hero for doing so' (p. xiii). The context in which biographers try today to place their subjects has become less intellectual and more social than Dilthey thought. Indeed, social history seems still to be conquering areas of the historiography of science that were once the preserves of intellectual historians. Dr Browne's endorsement of a contextualizing programme does not lead her to adopt the provocative stance maintained by some Darwin scholars. To be sure, we do find in her book sentences like the following: The idea of struggling to survive was in- grained in Darwin's personal outlook ... To someone ... so intimately familiar with the ideology of an expanding national power, selection by death or survival seemed an accurate description of what went on. Direct experience of imperial expansion encouraged him to see struggle, war, and extinction as inescapable truths of nature ... For Darwin, the balance of nature resembled an account book recording the financial affairs of an entrepreneurial company, with adaptations acting like circulating capital, representing past achievements and the wherewithal for future ventures. In the unknown interlocking movements of the human mind, Darwin's social and commercial context appears to have both generated and validated his scientific ideas. Natural selection intuitively seemed the right answer to a man thoroughly immersed in the productive, competitive world of early-Victorian England [p. 390]. But in the rest of her narrative the influence of social environment is shown much more in the shaping of Darwin's tastes, behaviour, manners and self-image than in the direct shaping of his ideas. Political events, social troubles, economic crises and even religious debates are a backdrop to the story rather than a haunting presence, as they are in Desmond and Moore's biography. Unlike Desmond and Moore, Dr Browne has decided that the materials do not justify an</page><page sequence="3">240 Book reviews attempt, apart from the pages devoted to Malthus' influence, systematically to connect Darwin's intellectual development to his attitude towards dissenters, atheists, radicals or their Whig adversaries. This leads her somewhat to downplay the importance of the debate on materialism, both within and outside Darwin's mind. Finally, I would like to raise a general point to stimulate further discussion on the subject of scientific biographies. Like any historian, the biographer must resort to conjectures. Being a narrative, a scientific biography cannot help but contain fictional elements: it must be to some extent fictionalized. Biographers must not only account for what happened, but they must also re-create, and even invent: for instance they must invent plausible links between events when the real links are not documented in the available evidence and must be inferred indirectly, or when they are too difficult to detail. Further- more, biographers are obliged to select some facts from the lives of their subjects, while omitting others, and to supply a connection between the ones selected that makes sense in an overall view. In so doing, they offer a personal interpretation. Now, interpretations are not picked up bodily from the sources. They are always, to some extent, invented. The difference between a historiographic essay and a biography is that in the latter the interpretation, instead of taking the form of an argument, can take the form of a narrative device, that is, a literary device in a minor key. I think there inevitably comes a moment in all biographies when the fussy reader is not clear if what is being written is a surmise or a fictionalization from existing sources, in other words, if it is based on evidence (whether direct or indirect) or on Einfiiblung. The present book is no exception, and the policy adopted of keeping the notes to a minimum does not help to remove the doubt. A reader may well ask, for instance: How does she know that Darwin was 'disappointed' to learn that the Beagle voyage might perhaps not be completely around the world (p. 159) ? Did he say so in a letter or did she get this impression indirectly from other documents relating to other aspects of Darwin's life in those very days ? And when she calls the geologist William Buckland a 'buffoon' (p. 415), is she reporting Darwin's or her own opinion? Or is it an allusion to Buckland's teaching performances (in which case a note would have been useful for the non-specialist) ? Of course these are very minor points. Still, passages like that on p. 133 on Henslow seeing in Darwin the man he himself had been some ten or fifteen years before leave me wondering if this is drawn from sources or re-created by Einfiiblung: a historian might want to know where the documents supporting this sentence are kept. And did Mr Owen (Fanny's father) really ruminate in the way he is reported to have done on p. 201? And what about a sentence like this: 'Darwin saw in FitzRoy's outburst the workings of aristocratic privilege: the absolute power of the British ruling classes' (p. 172) ? Being himself a part and an effect of the system, Darwin could not possibly write anything of this sort con- cerning himself and FitzRoy. And do passages like the following contain more than a surmise: 'Darwin, brought up on traditional British ideas of marital life, and thinking perhaps of his own failed relations with Fanny Owen, anxiously pondered how the [rhea] females could possibly balance the number of eggs and nests with available males' (p. 220) ? The same holds true of the bold (but apparently not unlikely) statement that Darwin's brother Erasmus' ' mysterious' sexual identity 'provided a shadowy backdrop' to Charles's musings on sex (pp. 374-5). Or, to quote one last passage: '[Darwin] and Fox ... visited the Fitzwilliam Gallery ... where Darwin rhapsodized over Titian's Venus, no doubt teasing Fox that parsonage wives were never quite so voluptuous. The smell of the varnish and the way the nudes were hung behind curtains gave the two of them a quietly salacious thrill' (p. 98). Whatever it may be, much of the skill of the biographer lies surely in making such inferences believable. The question holds true for more serious issues, too: to what extent is Einffublung at work when judgements are passed on the connection between Darwin and his social context? To borrow R. Young's words (although in a slightly different sense from what he meant): 'The essence is the articulations and the mediations' (p. 122).</page><page sequence="4">Book reviews 241 The book is beautifully produced.
