According to him, everything is a part of the all-unity, which has a divine character. God is present in the world, but his nature is incomprehensible. In this article I analyze two consequences of Frank's panentheistic view of the relation between science and theology. Firstly, the limits of scientific knowledge allow recognition of the mystery of the world and the transcendence of God. Secondly, Frank claimed that nature is a "trace" of God and the manifestation of the absolute reality, i.e. the all-unity. As a result, both science and theology lead to the knowledge of God, although we cannot understand His essence. Keywords Semen Frank • The absolute • The unknowable • Knowledge • Theology • Science Introduction The Russian philosophers of the Silver Age considered metaphysical questions as well as the relationship between physics and metaphysics (science and theology). This state of affairs was not accidental. Some Russian thinkers were educated in both philosophy and science. For example, Vladimir Solov'ëv - "The Father of the Russian philosophy" - studied for 4 years in the Faculty of Physics and Mathe- matics of the Moscow University, Nikolaj Losskij was a graduate of a similar department of the St Petersburg University, and Fr. Pavel Florensky published his first work in Russia on set theory. Continuing this list we could argue that one of the most prominent Russian philosophers addressing the problem of the relationship of T.

Obolevitch science and religion was Semen Frank (1877-1950). In this article, I will present and analyze his position on the questions and issues mentioned above. The concept of God Frank maintained that his idea was inspired by Plotinus, the German idealists, and especially by Nicolas of Cusa. Like these philosophers, Frank was convinced of the existence and the organic connection of all things which he - following Solov'ëv - termed "all-unity" or "total unity" (vseedinstvo)} The entire empirical world is contained in the Absolute (the absolute unity). Strictly speaking, the Russian philosopher distinguished two aspects in the Absolute. First, the absolute unity in its connection with the world (the absolute ad extra) is the ontological and epistemological basis of everything (its existence and cognition). Each individual being has its primordial background in the absolute unity. Hence the absolute, unconditional being is very close to us: "it is present with ultimate, absolute self- evidence in all consciousness of reality if only we have eyes to see it,"2 in the act of intuition. Frank repeated repeatedly that: Abstract knowledge is possible only as a derivative product of integral intuition. (...) The intuition of total-unity is the primary basis of all knowledge.3 Secondly, the Absolute as such (ad intra) is totally unfathomable, ineffable, transrational, or - as Frank put it in the title of his principal work - the absolute reality is "the Unknowable" (Nepostiämoe).4 The Absolute has a metalogical nature, i.e., it transcends every notion and its negation.5 Speaking about God we resort to positive (i.e. eternal, Almighty, merciful etc.) or negative (uncreated, infinitive etc.) descriptions, because we cannot express Him in another way. Nevertheless all our "definitions" of God are inadequate. God is above and before each definition and its negation. For this reason He cannot be grasped in a net of limited concepts. Thus our knowledge of God has a contradictory character: we speak of Him and simultaneously we are aware that this articulation is anthropomorphic and approximate. The only epistemological concept approved by Frank was "a learned ignorance" (docta ignorantia) - cognition of our ignorance of God (the absolute being-for-itself): The method of philosophizing by means of "a learned ignorance" is a kenotic method, a method of cognitive intercourse and "exhaustion." Just as a rich person who possesses a great deal of intellectual wealth can allow himself the 1 In this context Nicolas of Cusa used the similar expressions unus et omnia or omnia uniter.

In his letter to a friend entitled On the impossibility of philosophy (1944) he remarked: A philosophy, which would at the same time be dogmatic theology (philosophy within the catechism), calls forth my greatest protest. Such a thing is absolutely impossible. Even St. Thomas did not achieve it, so we, contemporary people, cannot accomplish it either. (...) Long ago I have formulated - for myself - the following thesis: "all speakers, as speakers, are liars," because for the sake of the beauty and composition of speech they must falsify and stylize reality. (...) Lastly, I say the same about philosophers (as they construct some completed system of the world and being, or even of God and world). (...) Obviously, I am philosopher enough not to claim I have searched the precise notion of God. No doubt, all our attributes have only a relative and a symbolic meaning (likewise in Thomas's thought). Indeed, God is merely the unknowable!7 The task of philosophy is "the rational transcendence of the limitations of the rational thought."8 As a result, Frank continued the venerable theological tradition known as negative or apophatic theology (to speak more correctly, theology stressing that God is beyond both positive and negative definition) developed by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, Nicolas of Cusa, and, first of all, the Eastern Fathers of the Church (i.e. the Cappadocian Fathers, St. Maxim the Confessor and St. Gregory of Palama).9 The following sentence summarizes Frank's religious conception: "The Absolute is both utterly separated (according to the etymology of this word), as 'entirely other', and omnipresent, all-embracing, common to all."10 In Frank's words, this thesis harmonizes with the Christian truth of God's transcendence and immanence. Now we can ask: how did Frank understand the relationship between this type of theology and science? Before we answer this question, we must first of all study some main aspects of Frank's idea of science. Frank's methodological principle Frank set forth his concept of scientific knowledge mainly in the essays Science and religion (1925) and Science and religion in the contemporary consciousness (1926). 6 Shein(1968), 16. 7 Frank (1996a), pp. 88-90. 8 Frank (1965), p. 44. 9 Frank noticed that his conception correspond to the doctrine of St. Gregory of Palama about the real distinction in God an unknowable essence (ousia) and energies (energeiai) by which God manifests himself in the created world. 10 Frank (1996b), p. 71. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">96 T. Obolevitch The Russian thinker states that science has its own method, purpose and object of research, different from the object of philosophy or theology: Science explores the world and its observable facts and does not take into consideration their connection to something other, while religion, in coming to know God, at the same time comes the world and life in their relationship to God. Hence, although religion and science refer to the same thing - the world and life - nevertheless they grasp these things from two different perspectives; consequently, they appear to be speaking about distinct things. (...) It seems that science investigates the inner structure of the center, the middle layer or section of being, whereas religion studies this center in its relationship to the beginning and the end, to being as whole or to its integral, primordial principle.11 Anticipating contemporary methodology, Frank remarked that in exploring the universe science should not refer to supernatural factors. However, this restriction of scientific research does not mean that science refuses to recognize the existence of the transcendental sphere: As regards authentic science it is not the case that it "does not admit" the interference of supernatural forces. It is just that science does not investigate these forces, leaves them out of account, as it were ignores them. (...) Science investigates the relationship between phenomena, that is, natural forces. It is perfectly normal that science, having its own tasks, does not complicate matters for itself by attending to the kinds of occurrences that arise when supernatural forces interfere.12 Frank admitted the principle of "methodological naturalism" (science should explain the world by the natural causes only). Unlike the positivists, on the other hand, the author of The Unknowable maintained that methodological naturalism does not imply metaphysical naturalism (or materialism which claims that "all forces observed in the world operate like blind natural forces" and thus rejects "any supernatural and rational forces."13 Against the then dominant neopositivism and atheism, Frank first of all "defended" theology against science and justified the use of science for theological purposes. However, let us return to the question raised above and ask: does theology (according to Frank) need science? For this purpose we will examine two aspects of Frank's concept of God: (1) the negative (apophatic) aspect and (2) the panentheistic. Both of them express the truth of God's transcendence and immanence. By taking into consideration the apophatism of Frank's theological conception (or that of Eastern theology in general), we can answer the question as to the relationship of theology and science as follows: scientific knowledge is useless for theology, because it in no way does it dispute the truth of the radical otherness and 11 Frank (1925), p. 4, 6; cf.

It seems that paths of the negative theology and science do not cross. As a consequence, a confrontation between science and theology - be it dialogue or conflict - is impossible. But we can consider this question the other way round, noting the role of negative theology for science. Namely, the intensive development of science shows the limits of human knowledge and the necessity of transcending the temporal representations of the empirical world. And if knowledge of the world (in the concrete, historical stage of its development) is imperfect, what can we say about God who is absolutely Other? As Pascal wrote: There is nothing more in keeping with reason than its self-repudiation. The ultimate effort of reason is to recognize that there is an infinity of things which are beyond it. It is but feeble if it does not see so far as to know this. But if natural things lie beyond it, what is there to be said of those which are supernatural?14 In other words, scientific progress - the origin of new theories, the discovery of new facts - allows believers to perceive the Mystery of the world and its Creator more clearly. Frank's point is that a true scientist has both great humility and courage in the cognition of reality: What is the main impulse of scientific work, of the scientific quest for knowledge and discovery? For the scientist it lies in the very mystery of being and in the sense of "wonder" (as Aristotle said15). (...) A scientist wants to penetrate reality more profoundly than an ordinary man; this means that he is aware of the hidden, inaccessible depths of being concealed from the ordinary gaze. One cannot call a scientist someone for whom the entire universe is exhausted in a direct perception, who claims to see reality as a whole lying before him on the palm of his hand and that everything can be easily known. On the contrary, a [true] scientist is one who feels the mysterious depths of being, who with Shakespeare knows: "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."16 The initial and the constant foundation of scientific consciousness is the recognition of one's own ignorance which Socrates expressed in the words "all / know is that / know nothing."17 According to Frank, docta ignorantia concerns transcendent reality as well as the empirical world. The encounter with the mystery of nature accentuates the truth of the apophatic theology of the Unknown God. The second aspect of Frank's theological concept is the panentheistic view that the entire empirical world is rooted in the Absolute. What meaning does scientific knowledge have for this thesis? In Frank's view, science explores only "segments" 14 Pascal (1910), p. 97. 15 Cf. Aristotle, Metaphisics, 982b, trans, by W.D. Ross: "For it is owing to their wonder that men both now begin and at first began to philosophize" (T.O.). 16 W. Shakespeare, Hamlet, act 1, scene 5 (T.O.). 17 Frank (1925), pp. 19-20. £} Springer</page><page sequence="6">98 T. Obolevitch of the world and lays open new, earlier, unknown segments. Investigation of the world is the manifestation of the ultimate reality. The limitations of human cognition of nature do put in question the truth that the cosmos as a whole and each individual thing is a "trace," an image and a symbol of the absolute unity.18 By discovering these traces we approach God - not in some concept or other, because He cannot be conceptualized, but through awareness of His presence and permanent action. "Science, to be sure, does not speak about God, but can lead us to Him through its findings".19 For many great scientists, the motivation for doing science was of a theological nature: to know better God's creation, to glorify God through their work. For example, Newton did not consider it to be anti-scientific to include a theological discussion in his Mathematical principles of natural philosophy, and Cantor saw set theory to be a path leading to the Absolute.20 In Frank's essay Religion and science we read the following sentence: "If someone admits science and considers its conditions, he is logically obliged to acknowledge the fundamental religious belief of the presence of higher spiritual, and rational, roots of being".21 Like the Eastern Fathers of the Church, Frank perceived the cosmos "as a living 'book' (a 'text' or even 'hyper-text')," "the 'face' of God".22 We must add that Frank often gave - contrary to his own declarations about the methodological difference science and theology - examples of "confirmation" of theological truth by scientific data. I do not intend to analyze this question23 in this article. It is notable that the Russian philosopher, especially in his early period, had a tended to so-called integral knowledge, i.e. "knowledge which opens the horizons for ever new hope" and "faith which is confirmed and verified by knowledge."24 We can interpret this "confirming of faith by knowledge" as an attempt to find the common point of meeting of theology and science. In Frank's opinion, both lead to the acknowledgment of the Mystery and Logos of the world. 18 Cf.
