<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume XLIII JANUARY 1963 Number 1 WHAT SENSE DOES IT MAKE TO SAY, "GOD ACTS IN HISTORY"? SCHUBERT M. OGDEN* T HE question has been posed, "Can one make theological sense of the statement, 'God acts in history'?" For the purposes of this discussion, I would like to reformulate the ques- tion to read as follows: "What sense does it make to say, 'God 'acts in his- tory'?" Since the differences between the two questions are slight, I must explain why I nevertheless think them important enough to make. First of all, the question as I have formulated it simply assumes a positive answer to the original question, and this seems to me an appropriate as- sumption to make in the present dis- cussion. I certainly do not want to presume too much, and I recognize there are many for whom the original question may seem more appropriate just because it does not make this as- sumption. But for my own part, the real issue is not whether the statement "God acts in history" makes sense but what kind of sense it makes. Further- more, the very fact that we are meeting in this place under these auspices and are the persons we are suggests that the possibility of speaking of God's acting in history is not the question before us. One may infer, to be sure, that we would not be here at all unless speak- ing of God's action were in some way or other problematic for us. We all recognize that not all the ways in which our fathers have spoken of God's acting in history are still relevant possibilities for us today. Indeed, it is probably just because some one or other of these ways that we have been accustomed to follow has now shown itself to be no longer relevant that we are tempted to ask whether one can really speak of God's acting at all. But this temp- * Schubert M. Ogden is associate professor of theology at Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University, where he has taught since 1956.

The present essay was orig- inally given as an address to the Spring Conference of the Divinity School Association of the Univer- sity of Chicago, May 11-12, 1962. The question of the conference to which the address was directed was: "Can one make theological sense of the state- ment, 'God acts in history'?" 1</page><page sequence="2">2 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION tation should be resisted-at any rate, by those of us who continue to profess the Christian faith and, at some level or other, are engaged in the task of explicating that faith in an adequate Christian theology. Because I take for granted that most of us here meet this condition, precision in formulating the question before us seems to me to re- quire the changes I have made from the original formulation. But I also have a second reason for making these changes. If I understand the lesson to be learned from the his- tory of what Frederick Ferre has called "contemporary linguistic philosophy,"' the question whether the statement "God acts in history" can make sense is a somewhat old-fashioned question. According to Ferre, the development of linguistic philosophy falls into two more or less distinct phases: an earlier phase characterized by "verificational analysis" and a more recent phase in which the emphasis has been on "func- tional analysis."2 In the earlier period, which was dominated by the logical positivists and their so-called "verifica- tion principle," the question under dis- cussion was precisely the question of whether theological statements can make sense; and the positivists, of course, gave a resoundingly negative answer to the question. But subsequent discussion has made clear that their answer was based less on a careful analysis of the actual use of theological language than on certain a priori as- sumptions that reflected, as one his- torian has written, "an extreme respect for science and mathematics" and "an extreme distaste for metaphysics."13 More recent linguistic philosophers, by contrast, have tended to proceed more cautiously. Instead of asking whether theological statements can make sense, they have attempted, by analyzing their function in actual religious and theo- logical speech, to determine what sense, if any, such statements in fact do make. If this shift in approach is, as I believe, a fortunate one, then it presumably has a bearing on our procedure here. It suggests that we will do better not to pronounce on the question of whether the statement "God acts in history" makes sense, except insofar as an at- tempt to show what sense it makes implies an answer to this question. If my attempt to explain the sense of the statement is successful, then, of course, one can make sense of it; for ab esse ad posse valet consequentia. On the other hand, if my attempt should fail, the possibility will still be open for someone else to show that and how the statement makes sense. The following discussion is divided into two main parts. In the first I shall attempt simply to clarify the problem as I understand it and to indicate very briefly the important resources available for solving it. In the second part I shall try to point the way to a constructive solution. It may be claimed without exagger- ation that no Protestant theologian of our time has given more sustained and self-conscious attention to the question of the meaning of theological state- ments than Rudolf Bultmann. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Bultmann has continued to be sensitive to the difficulties posed by traditional theolog- ical language for men like ourselves who share in a cultural consciousness dominated by the scientific world pic- ture and a distinctively modern under-</page><page sequence="3">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 3 standing of human existence. One could wish, perhaps, that Bultmann's re- sources for dealing with these problems were not so exclusively limited to those of Continental theology and philosophy and that he was more knowledgeable than he is of the work that has been done on the logic of theological lan- guage by Anglo-Saxon philosophers and theologians. Certainly for those of us who live in the Anglo-Saxon world and are sympathetic with Bultmann's basic theological approach there is an obli- gation, which I myself feel with increas- ing intensity, to enter into discussion with English-speaking thinkers who are concerned primarily to clarify the meaning of theological language.4 But while granting the limitations of Bult- mann's work, one must insist that the main problem of all his systematic efforts has been the meaning of the- ological statements and that what he has done by way of defining this prob- lem and attempting to solve it is of fundamental importance for the rest of us who also have the problem. As is well known, Bultmann main- tains that the language of Christian theology, both in Holy Scripture and in the classical theological tradition, is for the most part and in its central elements "mythical" or "mythological" language. By this he means that the statements in which theology speaks of God and his action in history have the same "objectifying" character as the statements of empirical science. Although the "intention" of such myth- ological statements-or, as we may also say, their "use" or function-is quite different from that of scientific state- ments, their grammatical and logical form is the same. Like scientific state- ments, they "objectify" the existential reality about which they speak and thus represent it in terms of space, time, causality, and substance-or, in a word, in the Kantian forms of sensibility and categories of understanding that Bult- mann assumes to be determinative for all theoretical knowledge. The result is that God and his action are represented as though God were but one more sec- ondary cause in the chain of secondary causes and his action but one more action alongside the action of other causal agents." It is of the greatest importance to un- derstand exactly what Bultmann means by "myth" or "mythology." The pre- ceding summary is intended to make clear that he does not so define "myth" as to make it inclusive of all oblique or analogical discourse about God.6 He holds, rather, that, in his sense of the term, "myth" refers to only one way in which God may be spoken about in con- cepts ordinarily used to speak of what is non-divine. As will be further dis- cussed hereafter, Bultmann distinguish- es a "mythological" way of speaking of God and his action from another way that he refers to as "analogy," and one can understand this distinction only if one carefully observes the restricted character of his definition of myth. The specific difference of myth is not that it speaks of God in concepts also appli- cable to the non-divine but that the concepts in which it speaks are the ob- jectifying concepts appropriate only to ordinary empirical knowledge such as is the proper concern of the various spe- cial sciences. Bultmann holds that such mythologi- cal language makes for a twofold diffi- culty. First, because mythological state- ments have the grammatical and logical form of scientific statements, they are</page><page sequence="4">4 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION open to scientific criticism, and the re- sults of such criticism are devastating. Given the thoroughgoing development of scientific thinking as we find it in the method of modern natural science, the mythological statements of theology seem to represent a form of primitive scientific thinking that is no longer cred- ible or relevant. Modern science simply has no need of the "God hypothesis" (Laplace) to perform its task, and mythological statements about God and his action are regarded by the scientist as utterly lacking in scientific support. The continuum of secondary causes does not include the cause represented by myth as God, and the action of such a being is not to be reckoned with in scientific explanations. Because, Bultmann argues, this atti- tude toward mythological statements on the part of the modern scientist pervades and determines our whole contemporary cultural consciousness, the problem in- evitably arises for all of us-or, at any rate, all of us who share in that con- sciousness-whether the statement "God acts in history" can make any sense. We recognize that it certainly cannot make scientific sense, since in the mythological terms in which it is usually stated, it comes into the sharp- est conflict with our scientific picture of the world. The logic of scientific dis- course simply does not leave room for the statement in its conventional myth- ological form. But, in addition to this first difficul- ty that mythological language poses, there is a second and, so Bultmann ar- gues, more fundamental difficulty. It may be equally doubted whether myth- ological statements make theological sense-or, better said, whether they are an adequate way of expressing the sense or meaning that theological statements are supposed to express. Just because mythology objectifies God and his ac- tion and thus represents them in the forms and categories appropriate only to science, it seriously misrepresents the transcendence of God and his action as Christian faith understands them. In- stead of preserving "the infinite qualita- tive difference" between God and the world, myth so represents God that he seems to be but one more item within the world. Thus, for example, the myth- ological way of speaking olf God's action as the Creator represents it as though it were simply the temporally prior action in the whole series of causal actions. Myth thereby obscures the truth that God's creative action is presupposed by all actions in the series, including the temporally first, if, indeed, there ever was any such first action. In a similar way, the mythological representation of God's action as the Redeemer or Con- summator (as, for example, in apoca- lyptic eschatology) pictures it as simply an action that stands temporally last in the causal series. Myth thus fails to make clear that God's redemptive ac- tion fulfils or consummates all actions, including the temporally last, insofar as one may meaningfully speak of such a last action. In short, for Bultmann, a mythologi- cal way of speaking of God and his action is not only problematic from the standpoint of modern science; it is also theologically inappropriate. Because myth speaks of God in objectifying cat- egories, it fails to do justice to faith's own understanding of God's hiddenness or transcendence. I noted that Bultmann regards this second difficulty posed by mythology as the more important of the two. He in- sists that the first problem of myth's evi- dent incompatibility with the thinking</page><page sequence="5">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 5 of science simply provides the occasion for focusing the more fundamental problem of myth's inappropriateness as the language of Christian faith. The first problem forces us to ask for the true meaning of theological statements and whether there is not some other non-mythological way in which this meaning can be expressed.' Bultmann's answer to these questions is given in his project of "existentialist interpretation." He holds that the true meaning of theological statements is not scientific but "existential" and that the existentialist analysis of the early Mar- tin Heidegger provides an alternative conceptuality in which this meaning can be given non-mythological expression. In saying that theological statements really have an existential intention or use, Bultmann means that their func- tion is to present a certain possibility for understanding human existence and directly or indirectly to summon their hearers to realize this possibility. This is the true intention, he holds, even of the mythological statements, which, on the face of it, seem to have a scientific or pseudoscientific use. Although such mythological statements have the logical form of objectifying statements, their function is not to provide scientific in- formation, but rather to express an un- derstanding of man's existence as a his- torical being who must continually de- cide how he is to understand himself in his world.8 Thus, to take our earlier ex- amples, the mythological statement that God is the Creator is, according to Bult- mann, "in its fundamental intention not the statement of a cosmological theory that seeks to explain the origin of the world, but rather man's confession to God as his Lord-the Lord to whom the world belongs, whose power and care sustain and preserve it, and to whom man himself owes obedience."9 To af- firm that God is the Creator, then, is in reality to affirm a certain possibility for understanding one's existence as a his- torical being; it is to affirm the utter dependence of one's self and his world on the existential reality of God's power and love, which are the ultimate ground of all created things. Likewise, the real use of the mythological statements that speak about God's final redemption of the world is very different from that, say, of modern scientific theories about the eventual "running-down" of the physical universe. Their true intention, Bultmann says, is to express the idea that "the fulfillment of life cannot be the result of human effort, but is rather a gift from beyond, a gift of God's grace."10 Therefore, to affirm such state- ments is really to affirm an understand- ing of one's existence in which he re- nounces every attempt at self-contrived security and opens himself wholly and completely to the security of God's love, wherein all things find an ultimate ac- ceptance. Bultmann proposes to solve the prob- lem of the meaning or sense of all theo- logical statements in the way illustrated by these two examples. He holds that the intention of such statements is ex- istential and that the task of theology is to recognize this and to bring their in- tention to appropriate expression. As in- dicated above, he regards Heidegger's existentialist analysis as making avail- able the philosophical concepts in which this may be done. In his judgment Heidegger has provided a technically clear and precise analysis olf the phe- nomenon of human existence that com- pletely avoids objectifying this phenom- enon either in the manner of mythology or in the manner of the special sciences of man.</page><page sequence="6">6 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION My own position is that the problem of the meaning of theological state- ments is the general problem clarified by Bultmann and that his proposed so- lution to it is essentially the correct solution. I, too, would say that the pri- mary use of all theological statements is existential and that the sense of the statement "God acts in history" is an existential sense. But while thus agree- ing with Bultmann's analysis of the general problem and with the essential direction of his solution, I would also insist that his solution is itself problem- atic and that the problems it raises de- fine, so to speak, the specific differences of the more general problem as I myself understand it. In particular, Bultmann's solution poses two problems that must also be taken into account and solved in any tenable solution to the larger prob- lem. There is, first, what I will call with some misgivings the one-sidedly exis- tentialist character of his solution. As the term "existentialist interpretation" itself suggests, Bultmann proposes to treat all theological statements as state- ments about man and his possibilities for understanding his existence. Thus, in prefacing his interpretation of Paul in the Theology of the New Testament, he argues that, for Paul "every asser- tion about God is simultaneously an assertion about man and vice versa") and that, therefore, "Paul's theology can best be treated as his doctrine of man.""1 The difficulty with this argu- ment, however, is that its conclusion is one-sided. If the premise is correct, that, for Paul, all statements about God are statements about man, and vice versa, then one could equally well con- clude that Paul's theology can best be presented as the doctrine of God. But Bultmann is reluctant to accept this second conclusion. For reasons that cannot be gone into here,'2 he displays a marked unwillingness to speak di- rectly of God and his action and prefers instead to speak of them only indirectly by speaking of man and his possibili- ties of self-understanding. Add to this, then, his repeated defenses of the theo- logical adequacy of Heidegger's existen- tialist analysis in which God does not so much as even figure, and what I mean by his one-sided existentialism should be obvious.'3 Other critics, of course, have re- marked this same one-sidedness and have even gone so far as to say that Bultmann's position is open to the dan- ger of so interpreting Christian faith that it is indistinguishable from a mere- ly human self-understanding utterly lacking in any divine basis or object.'4 But this is clearly to go too far. Both in practice and in theory, Bultmann makes clear that he has no intention of reducing faith simply to a human self-understanding. His view may fairly be said to be one-sided and to be less than fully secure against a reductive or restrictive existentialism. But the exis- tentialist interpretation he actually practices and, to a limited extent, also theoretically justifies is ampler than sometimes seems to be the case from certain of his statements. The chief evidence of this is the attention he has given in his more re- cent writings, beginning with his reply to his critics of 1952, to what he speaks of as "analogy."'5 Although he unfor- tunately fails to develop with any thoroughness what he means by "anal- ogy," he does state that, while a mythological way of speaking of God can have no place in an existentialist theology, an analogical way of speaking of him can and must have a place.</page><page sequence="7">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 7 Furthermore, he makes clear that the specific difference of analogy from mythology is that it represents God not in the objectifying categories of scientific thinking but in the non-ob- jectifying "existentials" of Heidegger's philosophy. Analogy thus represents God's action as analogous to human action and the relation between God and man as analogous to the relation of men with one another. In this way, analogy, unlike mythology, preserves God's hiddenness or transcendence be- cause it represents him as "a personal being acting on persons.""' In short, Bultmann's theory of anal- ogy, however fragmentary and unde- veloped, makes clear that he has no in- tention of excluding by his existential- ist interpretation a direct speaking of God and his action such as Christian faith requires. Demythologizing there must indeed be, and it must be radical and thoroughgoing. But the positive alternative to mythology is not only existentialist interpretation but existen- tialist interpretation plus analogy-or, better said, existentialist interpretation as inclusive of an analogical speaking of God and his action. However, because Bultmann's treat- ment of analogy is so fragmentary and because his aversion to direct speaking of God is so marked, his position does have a certain one-sidedness that re- quires correction. And here is where I see the great importance of Charles Hartshorne's philosophical theology. I believe it can be shown that Harts- horne's "dipolar" view of God pro- vides a virtually exact counterpart to Heidegger's existentialist analysis of man. By attempting to take seriously "the religious idea of God" and work- ing out an understanding of God in strict analogy to personal existence, Hartshorne presents in its fulness what is barely more than postulated in Bult- mann's fragmentary remarks concern- ing analogy. He thus provides a means for correcting Bultmann's one-sided existentialism by offering a precise philosophical conceptuality in which God as well as man can be appropri- ately spoken about in non-mythological terms. My view is that Bultmann's existentialist solution to the problem of the meaning of theological state- ments can be fully justified-that is, fully justified in accordance with his own intention in proposing it-only when Heidegger's existentialist analysis is complemented or supplemented by something like Hartshorne's dipolar theism.17 I have spoken of Bultmann's existen- tialist one-sidedness only with certain misgivings. This is because I profound- ly share his conviction that all theo- logical statements are, directly or indi- rectly, existential statements and that there are serious dangers in speaking as though only some such statements are existential, while others have to do not with man but with God and his action. I fear my own proposal just now to supplement Bultmann's position with Hartshorne's-or, rather, to bring the two positions together into one inte- grated position-is open to just this misunderstanding. I must insist, there- fore, that, in calling for the correction of Bultmann's one-sided existentialism by Hartshorne's fully developed theism, I do not intend to abandon the position that all theological statements are exis- tential statements. That no such aban- donment is logically required seems evident to me because, for Hartshorne, no less than for Bultmann, to speak of God and his action is also to speak of man and his possibilities of self-</page><page sequence="8">8 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION understanding, and, of course, vice versa.'8 The second problem posed by Bult- mann's project of existentialist interpre- tation-or, rather, by his own execu- tion of that project-arises from his failure consistently to carry it out. I have argued at length elsewhere"l that he stops short of a thoroughgoing exis- tentialist interpretation of theological statements in the central matter of christology. In the manner of that radi- cally "christocentric" theology that is one main strand in the Protestant tra- dition, he claims that authentic human existence is factually possible solely in consequence of God's unique act in Jesus Christ. Although all men, simply as men, have the "possibility in prin- ciple" of authentic life, this possibility becomes a "possibility in fact" for them exclusively in the event of Jesus' cruci- fixion or the proclamation of the Chris- tian church in which that event is again and again re-presented. But, as I have tried to show, this claim as such is, by Bultmann's own definition, a myth- ological claim and therefore stands in need of demythologizing, which is to say, existentialist interpretation. In one sense, of course, Bultmann himself recognizes this, and his existen- tialist interpretation of the christologi- cal statements of the New Testament and the theological tradition is an at- tempt to express the existential mean- ing of Jesus Christ. But what he refuses to accept is the implication that the significance of Jesus is simply that he decisively manifests or reveals man's universal possibility of authentic exist- ence in and under the love of God. Jesus not only decisively reveals God's love, he claims, but actually constitutes it, so that apart from him (or the message of the church that proclaims him), man cannot actually realize his authentic life. In making this claim, however, Bult- mann falls back into the very mythol- ogy he wants to overcome. By saying that God acts to redeem men only in the history of Jesus Christ, he subjects God's action as the Redeemer to the objectifying categories of space and time and thus mythologizes it. There- fore, I argue, the only course open to one who wants to follow Bultmann in his intention is to carry out his existen- tialist interpretation with a consistency he himself fails to display. The claim "only in Jesus Christ" must be inter- preted to mean not that God acts to redeem only in the history of Jesus and in no other history but that the only God who acts to redeem any history- although he in fact redeems every his- tory-is the God whose redemptive action is decisively revealed in the word that Jesus speaks and is. But this position obviously has its own complex of problems, and, in par- ticular, raises the question of the sense, if any, in which one can still say with the Christian community that the his- tory of Jesus is the decisive act of God. Since I understand this question to be the crux of the problem before us here, it is toward answering it that the second and constructive part of this discussion must be directed. II If one proposes to deal with the prob- lem of the sense of theological state- ments in the way I have indicated, he is immediately faced with the question of analogy. It is well known that this question has been and still is perhaps the most complex and difficult question the theologian faces. Its difficulty is felt by many with particular force today</page><page sequence="9">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 9 because it is widely believed by con- temporary philosophers and theologians that the classical theory of analogy cannot be maintained, since it fails to solve the problem it purports to solve. Intended to provide a middle way be- tween univocality and equivocality-or between anthropomorphism and agnos- ticism-it actually does nothing but oscillate uneasily between the two ex- tremes, caught in an inescapable dilem- ma.20 Thus Ferre argues persuasively that "it is no longer possible. .. to hold that the logic of analogy, as it has nor- mally been interpreted, is cogent" and proposes that it be reassigned to a purely "formal" rather than "material" function in "the manifold logic of theism.""21 While recognizing the complexity and difficulty of this question, I, too, hold that the classical theory of analogy is untenable. Instead of solving the problem it is intended to solve, it but reflects and perpetuates the problem in the way its modern critics have so often pointed out. But I also hold that the problematic character of the clas- sical theory of analogy is entirely of a piece with the problems posed by clas- sical theism generally and is, indeed, but a particularly clear evidence of the indefensibility of this theological po- sition. Because classical theism repre- sents the impossible attempt to synthe- size the personalistic view of God of Scripture with the substance ontology of classical Greek philosophy, the the- ory of analogy it develops to rationalize its procedures cannot but be an incon- sistent and untenable theory. But to grant that the classical theory of analogy is untenable is not to con- cede the untenability of all theories of analogy-any more than to reject a classical theistic position as indefensi- ble is to say that no theistic position can be defended. On the contrary, Harts- horne has amply demonstrated that a consistent logic of analogy can be developed, and that the ancient dilem- ma of anthropomorphism and agnos- ticism can be resolved without in any way prejudicing the claims of Christian faith.22 That he does this only by tak- ing the dilemma by the horns and de- veloping a frankly "anthropomorphic" view of God must be admitted. But he also convincingly shows the tradi- tional prejudices against such a view to spring not from commitment to the understanding of God attested by Scrip- ture (with which understanding, on the contrary, this view is perfectly com- patible) but rather from the tacit as- sumption of the posture of Greek meta- physics.23 It is impossible to present here either Hartshorne's theory of analogy or the view of God of which it is the logical counterpart and rationalization. But what can and, indeed, must be done is briefly to outline the conception of God that I myself hold primarily as a result of Hartshorne's influence. I can claim no originality for this conception but frankly acknowledge my depend- ence on Hartshorne, whose writings fully develop the kind of position I am concerned to present. The crucial insight for this position is that God is to be conceived in strict analogy with the human self or person. The force of the word "strict" is that, as Whitehead says, God is not to be treated as an exception to metaphysical principles, but rather is to be under- stood as exemplifying them.24 Thus, for example, if to be a self is possible only by being related to and dependent on others, and most directly on the others that constitute one's body, then</page><page sequence="10">10 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION God also can be conceived only as re- lated to and dependent on the others that constitute his body, which is to say, the whole world of created beings. On the other hand, the word "analogy" reminds us that God is not a self in univ- ocally the same sense as man, that, as Whitehead puts it, God is not simply an exemplification of metaphysical prin- ciples but is their "chief" exemplifica- tion.25 Thus, whereas the human self is effectively related only to a very few others-and, indeed, only to a very few others within the intimate world of its own body-the divine self is effectively related to all others in such a way that there are no gradations of intimacy of the various creatures to it. God is not located in a particular space or time, but rather is omnipresent and eternal, in the sense that he is directly present to all spaces and times and they to him. Or, to take another illustration of the same point, God's dependence on his world, which is a real and not merely verbal dependence, is not simply the same as man's dependence on his world or body. We are dependent on our bodies not only for whether we shall be in this actual state or that but also for whether we shall be in any state at all. Ours is, we may say, a depend- ence both for existence and for actu- ality. In the case of God, however, there is no existential dependence, but only an actual dependence. That he is, in some actual state or other, or in re- lation to some actual world, is depend- ent on nothing whatever and is in the strictest sense necessary. The only thing that is contingent-and that only in part-is what he is, what actual state of the infinite number of states possible for him is in fact actualized; and this depends both on his own contingent or free decisions and on the free decisions of the creatures who constitute his world.26 But if God is thus to be conceived in strict analogy to the human self, then his action must be understood in strict analogy to the action of man. In saying this, however, we must take pains to clarify exactly what we mean by man's action. We commonly understand a human act to be a specific word or deed whereby, through the instrumentality of the body and its various members, the self undertakes to carry out its par- ticular purposes or projects. Thus I may be said to be acting in any attempt, through the means of the spoken or written word, to communicate my understanding of the issues of this dis- cussion. But this common meaning of the words "human act" is certainly not their only or even primary meaning. Both Heidegger and Hartshorne, each in a somewhat different way, remind us that human action is also to be under- stood in another and more fundamental sense as the action whereby the self as such is constituted. Behind all our public acts of word and deed there are the self's own private purposes or proj- ects, which are themselves the product of action or decision. Indeed, it is olnly because the self first acts to constitute itself, to respond to its world, and to decide its own inner being that it acts at all in the more common sense of the word; all its outer acts of word and deed are but ways of expressing and implementing the inner decisions where- by it constitutes itself as a self. These decisions by which the human self acts to constitute its own inner being may take one or the other of two basic forms-or, as we may also say, the self is confronted by two basic pos- sibilities for understanding itself in re- lation to its world.27 Either it can open</page><page sequence="11">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 11 itself to its world and make its decisions by sensitively responding to all the influences that bear upon it, or it may close itself against its world and make its decisions on the basis of a much more restricted sensitivity than is actu- ally possible for it. In other words, man can act either as a self who loves and thus participates fully and completely in his own being and in the being of others, or he can act as a self who hates and thus is estranged both from the more intimate world of his own bodily life and the larger world of fellow selves. In the former case, all his out- ward acts of word and deed will be in function of the inner act whereby he constitutes himself as one who loves- just as in the latter case, by contrast, all his acts in the more common sense of the word will but express or imple- ment the more fundamental act of a self who hates. Now if God's action is to be under- stood by strict analogy to the action of man, what is meant by man's action is, first of all, this inner act whereby the human self as such is constituted, and constituted, moreover, as a self who loves. According to the central claim of Christian faith, the being of God is a being of "pure unbounded love" (Charles Wesley). I understand this to imply that the primary meaning of God's action is the act whereby he con- stitutes himself as God by participating fully and completely in the world of his creatures and thereby laying the ground for the next stage of the cre- ative process. Because his love, unlike ours, is pure and unbounded, his re- lation to his creatures and theirs to him is direct and immediate. The closest analogy-and it is but an analogy-o is our relation to our own bodily states, especially the states of our brains. Whereas we can act on other persons and be acted on by them only through highly indirect means such as spoken words and bodily actions, the interac- tion that takes place between our selves or minds and our own brain cells is much more intimate and direct. We respond with virtual immediacy to the impulses that come from our brains, and it is over our brains (or their indi- vidual cells) that our decisions as selves or minds exercise a virtually direct power or control. I hold with Harts- horne28 that the interaction between God and the world must be understood analogously to this interaction between our own minds and bodies-with the differences that the former interaction is infinitely more immediate and direct and takes place not between God and a selected portion of his world (analo- gous to our own brain cells and central nervous system) but between God and the whole world of his creatures. Be- cause his love or power of participation in the lives of others is literally bound- less, there are no gradations in intimacy of the creatures to him, and so there can be nothing in him corresponding to our nervous system or sense organs. The whole world is, so to say, his sense organ, and his interaction with every creature is unimaginably immediate and direct. It is in terms of this conception, in which God's action is conceived by strict analogy to man's, that I propose to interpret the Christian faith in God as Creator and Redeemer and the tra- ditional theological statements in which that faith has found expression. On this conception, to say that God acts as the Creator is not only to say that both I and my world are utterly dependent on his power and love and that I am bound to be obedient to his will as it</page><page sequence="12">12 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION pertains to myself and my world. That this existential meaning is the indirect meaning of the statement may be read- ily granted. But what it directly says is that the ultimate ground of every actual state of the world is not merely the individual decisions of the creatures who constitute its antecedent states but rather these decisions as responded to by God's own decision of pure un- bounded love. In a similar way, to say that God acts as Redeemer is to say more than that I now have the possi- bility of that radical freedom from myself and openness to my world that constitutes the authentic existence of love. It is also to say-and that directly -that the final destiny both of myself and of all my fellow creatures is to contribute ourselves not only to the self-creation of the subsequent worlds of creatures but also to the self-creation of God, who accepts us without con- dition into his own everlasting life, where we have a final standing or se- curity that can nevermore be lost. I cannot develop fully the implica- tions of this basic conception or show how it might be used to provide a non- mythological interpretation of all the claims implicit in the Christian under- standing of God. But, hopefully, even this brief outline will make clear what is meant by saying that an adequate existentialist interpretation of theologi- cal statements must be understood to include an analogical speaking of God and his action. I have tried to show that, although all theological statements directly or indirectly have an existen- tial significance, the direct reference of some theological statements is not to man and his possibilities of decision but to God and his action as Creator and Redeemer. I now turn directly to the question, "What sense does it make to say, 'God acts in history'?" It may appear that the line of thought I have been develop- ing is a strange preparation for answer- ing this question. For the force of the preceding argument is to affirm that, in its fundamental sense, God's action is not an action in history at all. Al- though his action as creator is related to history-and, indeed, is the action in which all historical events are ulti- mately grounded-his creative action as such is not an action in history, but an action that transcends it-just as by analogy our own inner decisions as selves are not simply identical with any of our outer acts of word and deed but rather transcend or lie behind such acts as the decisions in which our words and deeds are grounded and to which they give expression. Likewise, God's action as the Redeemer cannot be simply iden- tified with any particular historical event or events. As the act whereby he repeatedly actualizes his own divine es- sence by responding in love to all the creatures in his world, it is an act that transcends the world as its ultimate ful- filment-just as, again by analogy, the acts whereby we constitute our own selves by responding to our worlds can never be identified with any of the fac- tors within these worlds to which we re- spond. If, however, this conception is ac- cepted as valid, it may seem to make impossible any statement that God actu- ally acts within history. Does it not, in fact, completely rule out all such state- ments by representing God's act as something necessarily timeless and un- historical? I may respond to this question, in the first place, by suggesting that such words as "timeless" and "unhistorical" do not conduce to clarity in grasping</page><page sequence="13">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 13 the fundamental issue. If the viewpoint set forth is correct, there is a real sense -namely, an analogical sense--in which God as well as man is a temporal and historical being.29 Since God is to be un- derstood in strict analogy to the human self or person, in him no less than in man one must distinguish between what he essentially is and the contingent acts or states in which his essence is again and again actualized. God is not the timeless absolute of Greek metaphysics, who may be said to act only in some Pickwickian sense that bears no real analogy to anything that we know as action. Rather, he is the living dynamic God of Scripture to whom the temporal distinctions of past, present, and future may be properly applied and whose be- ing is the eminent instance of historical being. But, on the other hand, God's historicity is an eminent historicity, and it cannot be confused with the ordinary historicity of man and the other crea- tures. God acts, and he acts in the strict sense of the word; but his action is his action, and it cannot be simply identi- fied with the action of ordinary histori- cal beings. Is there no sense, then, in which God may be meaningfully said to act in his- tory? There are, I believe, two senses in which this may be said. If we recall our basic insight that God is to be conceived in strict analogy to the human self and that, in partic- ular, his relation to the world is to be viewed as analogous to our own relation to our bodies, then we may say that every creature is to some extent his act -just as, by analogy, all our bodily ac- tions are to some extent our actions. There is, to be sure, a certain freedom on the part of the creatures so that they are the result not only of God's action but also of their own. They are in part, at least, self-created. Nevertheless, this freedom has definite limits ultimately grounded in God's own free decision, and every creature has its basis in God's creative action. Although the acts whereby God actualizes his essence are his acts and not the acts of the crea- tures, every creature is what it is only by partly reflecting or expressing in its action God's own free decisions. This is the first sense in which God may be meaningfully said to act in his- tory. But there is also a second sense in which this may be said, and with it we come to the crux of our problem. It is the distinctive prerogative of the uniquely human being that it not only is but also knows or understands that it is. Man has the capacity of conscious- ness or of self-consciousness, and so he is uniquely the creature of meaning. He is able to understand himself and his fellow creatures and the divine reality in which they have their origin and end and, through his thought and language, is able to bring all this to a unique ex- pression. As logos himself, he is able to grasp the logos of the reality about him and to re-present it through symbolic speech and action. This capacity to discern meaning and to give it symbolic expression is what lies behind the whole complex phenom- enon of human culture. It is also what lies behind the particular cultural ex- pression that we designate as "religion." For what constitutes "religion" as one cultural expression alongside of others is the attempt to express the ultimate meaning of man's existence by grasping the divine logos that he encounters in his experience and re-presenting it through appropriate symbolic forms. All the var- ious historical religions are so many such attempts, and each of them im- plicitly or explicitly makes the claim</page><page sequence="14">14 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION that through it man is uniquely or de- cisively confronted with the word that reveals the ultimate truth about his ex- istence. This is to say that man as the being who can understand his existence and can express its meaning symbolically through word and deed can, at least in principle, also re-present or speak for God. Insofar as what comes to expres- sion through his speech and action is the gift and demand signified by God's transcendent action as Creator and Re- deemer, he re-presents not only his own understanding of God's action, but God's action itself. Indeed, we may go further and say that, in this case, man's action actually is God's action-just as, in our own case, our outer acts of word and deed may be said to be ours just because or insofar as they are under- stood to give expression to the inner actions whereby we constitute our ex- istence as selves. In one sense, of course, all our bodily actions, including the actions of all our organs and cells, are our actions because to some extent they are the result of the inner decisions by which we actualize our selves or persons. And we have just seen that there is something analogous to this in the case of God, that every creature in his body or world is to some extent his action because it is created by him by being ultimately grounded in the decisions through which he actual- izes his own divine essence. But we all recognize, I think, that, although all our actions are equally ours, some of them are peculiarly ours in a way that the others are not, especially in our rela- tions with other persons. This is partic- ularly true of those uniquely human actions in which, through word and deed, we give symbolic expression to our own inner beings and understand- ings. Such actions are, as we say, our "characteristic" actions, for in them or through them the persons we are, are uniquely re-presented or revealed to others. Each of us is known to other persons through such acts, and all the other things that we may be and do are interpreted by our fellows in terms of what they understand to be typically our statements and actions. Thus, to take a specific example, my understanding of my wife and of myself in relation to her is based upon certain of her words and deeds in a way that it is not based on the many other things that she is and says and does. Who she is for me is who I understand her to be in -terms of certain quite particular events, having a "once-for-all" histori- cal character, that I take to be revela- tory of her person and attitude as they relate to me. It is true, of course, that my understanding of her is to some ex- tent constantly changing in the light of new "revelations" of her being and that I can never be absolutely certain that she really is as I understand her to be. But even so, not everything she says and does is equally important in reveal- ing her to me, and I always think of her in terms of certain actions that are hers in a sense that the other things she does are not. It is because all of us commonly un- derstand one another in this way that we are occasionally even led to deny that someone has done something he has in fact done because the act in question is understood to be so untyp- ical or uncharacteristic. Thus it is not unusual to find ourselves saying such things as, "Why, John wouldn't do that!" My point, in short, is that some of our outer acts of word and deed either are in fact (or at least are understood</page><page sequence="15">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 15 to be) our acts in a way that other of our acts are not. Because certain of our actions give peculiarly apt expression to what we actually are (or are rightly or wrongly believed to be by others), these actions are our actions (or are believed to be our actions) in a special sense of the word. A strictly analogous statement can be made about the actions of God. Al- though every creature, as we have said, is in one sense his act, certain creature- ly happenings may be said to be his act in another and quite special sense. Wherever or insofar as an event in his- tory reveals or expresses God's charac- teristic action as Creator and Redeemer, it actually is his act in a sense in which other historical events are not. It will be obvious from what has been said that the possibility of being such a special act of God is peculiarly open to those uniquely human events in which man expresses his understanding of the ultimate meaning of his existence through symbolic speech and action. Because man, at least in principle, can grasp and express the ultimate truth about his life, his words and deeds al- ways carry within themselves, so to speak, the possibility of becoming an act of God. It is also possible, of course, that they will not become God's act, that the understanding to which they give expression will not re-present the divine logos or will re-present it only in a fragmentary and distorted way. The existence of the various historical reli- gions is a constant reminder that this possibility is in fact actualized; for given the radically different and con- flicting understandings of existence ex- pressed in these religions, they cannot all be true and so cannot all be genuine revelations or acts of God. But wher- ever or insofar as particular religious symbols appropriately re-present God's action as Creator and Redeemer, they actually are or become his act in a sense strictly analogous to the sense in which some of our own symbolic actions are our acts in a way that other of our acts are not. Of course, it is not such intentionally symbolic actions alone that have the pos- sibility of being acts of God. Any histori- cal event, whether intended by anyone as symbolic or not, can become an act of God insofar as it is received by some- one as a symbol of God's creative and redemptive action. Because, as we have seen, man is uniquely the creature of meaning, there is no event that he ex- periences that cannot become for him such a symbol. The objective ground of this possibility is that, by the "analogy of being," not only man himself but also every event or creature is in some sense the image or reflection of the transcend- ent God and thus expresses in its own creaturely nature God's being and ac- tion. It may be argued, to be sure, that one can discern this symbolic meaning in any historical event only in the light of some intentionally symbolic action such as a human word or deed through which the meaning of God's action is re- presented. The truth in this argument is that man is the creature of meaning and that his encounter with existence and understanding of it are ordinarily mediated by such intentionally symbol- ic structures as concepts and language. But it would be wrong to assign such intentional symbols any kind of abso- lute priority. After all, they are them- selves the products of man's immediate encounter with existence, and so are not original but derived. If we must decide the question of priority as between the symbolic meaning of events themselves and the intentionally symbolic meaning</page><page sequence="16">16 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of our own words and deeds, the former is undoubtedly prior. The various reli- gions, as well as human culture gen- erally, have the character of a response to something more original than them- selves. They are human attempts in face of the events of existence itself, to dis- cern the divine word or meaning of which these events are understood to be the symbols. But, on the other hand, just because man is the creature of meaning and or- dinarily understands and expresses his existence through the intentionally sym- bolic actions of human words and deeds, such actions are uniquely adapted to be- come acts of God. Therefore, what we mean when we say that God acts in his- tory is primarily that there are certain distinctively human words and deeds in which his characteristic action as Crea- tor and Redeemer is appropriately re- presented or revealed. We mean that there are some human actions, some specific attempts to express the ultimate truth of our existence through symbolic words and deeds, that are vastly more than merely human actions. Because through them nothing other than the transcendent action of God himself is re-presented, they are also acts of God, that is, they are acts of God analogously to the way in which our outer acts are our acts insofar as they appropriately re-present our own characteristic deci- sions as selves or persons. Against this background, I may now answer the question raised at the end of the first part of the discussion. I asked there how one can overcome Bult- mann's own inconsistency in carrying out his project of existentialist interpre- tation while at the same time saying with the Chrisian community that the history of Jesus of Nazareth is the de- cisive act of God.30 If the preceding ar- gument is correct, then to say of any historical event that it is the decisive act of God can only mean that, in it, in distinction from all other historical events, the ultimate truth about our ex- istence before God is normatively re- presented or revealed. The decisiveness of the event, in other words, lies in its power to decide between all the various and conflicting historical claims to re- veal the divine logos or meaning every- where discernible to our experience. In this sense, a decisive act of God is the "revelation of revelations" or, in Til- lich's sense, the "final" revelation that provides the criterion by which all puta- tive revelations are at once judged and fulfilled.31 That any event should become such a decisive act of God is, of course, also a function of its being received and un- derstood by someone as having decisive revelatory power. A revelation is not only a revelation of something (or some- one) but also a revelation to somebody -just as analogously, in the example above, certain of my wife's words and deeds reveal her being for me both be- cause they in fact express her inner attitude toward me and because I re- ceive them as having such expressive power by understanding her and myself in relation to her in the way they con- cretely make possible. Indeed, this lat- ter or "subjective" component in the revelatory correlation is religiously or existentially fundamental. No event can become a decisive act of God for us un- less we receive it as determinative for our self-understanding; and, as has been indicated, we may receive events as thus decisive, and so as final revela- tions of God's being and attitude, which in fact do not re-present his gift and demand as they actually confront us. Therefore, Luther can say in the state-</page><page sequence="17">"GOD ACTS IN HISTORY" 17 ment so often quoted from the Large Catechism that "the trust and the ifaith of the heart alone make both God and an idol. ... For these two belong to- gether, faith and God. That to which your heart clings and entrusts itself is, I say, really your God."32 On the other hand, Luther also recog- nizes that there is a "wrong" as well as a "right" faith and that it is only when "your faith and trust are right" that "your God is the true God."33 What constitutes such "right" faith he subse- quently makes clear when he says that God "wishes to turn us away from ev- erything else, and to draw us to himself, because he is the one eternal good."34 In other words, there is an "objective" as well as a "subjective" component in the revelatory correlation, and this means that an event is a decisive revela- tion of God only insofar as it truly re- presents God's being and action as ex- istential gift and demand. This it can do only insofar as its form and structure are such that the possibility of self- understanding they express is in fact the true or authentic understanding of human existence. To say with the Christian commu- nity, then, that Jesus is the decisive act of God is to say that in him, in his outer acts of symbolic word and deed, there is expressed that understanding of hu- man existence which is, in fact, the ulti- mate truth about our life before God; that the ultimate reality with which we and all men have to do is God the sov- ereign Creator and Redeemer, and that in understanding ourselves in terms of the gift and demand of his love, we real- ize our authentic existence as men. My argument here rests on the con- viction that the entire reality of Jesus' history-or, at any rate, of his history as it is presented to us in the Gospels-- is simply a transparent means of re- presenting a certain possibility for un- derstanding human existence.35 Not only Jesus' preaching and acts of heal- ing, but also his fellowship with sin- ners and-unintentionally, perhaps-his eventual death on the cross are so many ways of expressing symbolically an un- derstanding of man's existence before God-the understanding, namely, that all things have their beginning and end in God's pure unbounded love, and that it is in giving himself wholly into the keeping of this love, by surrendering all other securities, that man realizes his authentic life. In relation to this under- standing of human existence and to the one task of giving it appropriate sym- bolic expression through word and deed, everything in Jesus' history is strictly instrumental. He knows no other work than to reveal the love of the Father in all its radical meaning as gift and de- mand, and he neither makes nor toler- ates any claims other than those that this love itself makes or implies (cf., e.g., Luke 11:27-28; Mark 3:31-35; Matt. 7:21). But if this understanding of existence that Jesus re-presents is true, if we in fact are created and redeemed by God's sovereign love, then, in a real sense, Jesus himself is God's decisive act in human history. For in him, in the word that he speaks and is, God's action as Creator and Redeemer is expressed with utter decisiveness; and this can only mean, for the reasons presented above, that he actually is God's decisive act. We may also say, of course, that if Jesus is God's decisive act, then the ul- timate truth about our existence-and, indeed, about every man's existence- is that we are created and redeemed by God's love, and that it is in abandoning ourselves wholly to him that we realize</page><page sequence="18">18 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION our true life. It is the nature of the de- cision of Christian faith that it resolves this hypothetical statement into a cat- egorical confession by affirming its an- tecedent and thus also affirming its con- sequent. My conviction-and the con- viction to which this discussion has tried to give support-is that both of these affirmations are valid and can be so understood as to make sense. So far from being incompatible, the two state- ments that God's act is, in one sense, not a historical act at all, while, in an- other sense, it is precisely the act of Jesus' history, mutually require and support one another. Just when we take with complete seriousness the utter transcendence of God's action as sov- ereign Creator and Redeemer, the his- torical event of Jesus' life and ministry is seen to be God's decisive act in hu- man history. For the whole meaning of this event is to express or reveal God's transcendent love as the sole basis of our authentic existence; and just in this fact it stands before us as itself God's act in a sense that we both can and must affirm.36 NOTES 1.

Another way of explain- ing what is meant by "strict" is made clear by Hartshorne when he argues that there must be a literal as well as an analogical sense in which fun- damental concepts refer to God ("The Idea of God-Literal or Analogical?" Christian Scholar, XXXIX [1956], 131-36; cf. The Logic of Perfec- tion, op. cit., pp. 133 ff.). 25. Op. cit., p. 521. 26. Cf. "The Idea of God-Literal or Analogi- cal?" Christian Scholar, XXXIX (1956), 135. I may note that it is just this distinction between actuality and existence, and thus between actual and existential dependence, that those who express an exaggerated fear of "anthropomorphism" com- monly fail to make. When Tillich argues, for ex- ample, that "a God who is not able to anticipate every possible future is dependent on an absolute accident and cannot be the foundation of an ulti- mate courage" (Systematic Theology, Vol. I [Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1951], pp. 275- 76), he completely ignores this distinction and so is forced to realize one legitimate theological mo- tive only by sacrificing another. For a discussion of the theological importance of the distinction as it is presented in Whitehead's philosophy, cf. what Hartshorne says in Reality as Social Process (Glen- coe, Ill.: Free Press, 1953), pp. 204-7. 27. Cf. Rudolf Bultmann, Glauben und Verste- hen, Vol. I (2d ed.; Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1954), pp. 222-23. 28. Cf. Man's Vision of God, pp. 174-205. 29. It is for this reason that the concept of "ex- istence" can be applied to God analogically without requiring, as Bultmann fears, that one must then understand "existence" in the pre-Kierkegaardian sense of "reale Vorhandensein im Unterschied von 'Essenz' " (cf. Rudolf Bultmann, "Zur Frage einer 'philosophischen Theologie,' " Einsichten: Gerhard Kriiger zum 60. Geburtstag [Frankfurt: Vittorio Klostermann, 1962], p. 37). To be sure, I agree with Bultmann that one must speak, first of all, of God's "eternity" and that such speaking excludes applying to him "temporality" and "historicity" in the univocal sense in which they apply to man. But the assumption Bultmann makes in criticizing my position, that "eternity" and "historicity" (or "temporality") are mutually exclusive seems to me to hold only if one understands "eternity" in the sense of the classical theistic tradition, rather than in the very different sense of the Scriptures. What the Scriptures teach us, in my understanding, is not that God's eternity is the timelessness that charac- terizes the absolute being of Greek metaphysics, but that his eternity is precisely his eminent tem- porality or historicity. In any case, only if this is so is it meaningful to speak of God in analogy to human existence and to say with Bultmann that God is properly understood only as "a personal being acting on persons" (cf. Jesus Christ and Mythology, p. 70). The question of the possibility of analogy as Bultmann seems to understand it is, in my judgment, one and the same as the question of whether "historicity" and "temporality" have an eminent sense that clarifies precisely what we mean by God's "eternity." 30. In the remainder of the discussion, I am particularly mindful of the criticism directed to me in different ways in the reviews of Christ with- out Myth by Rudolf Bultmann (Journal of Reli- gion, XLII [1962], 225-27) and by James M. Robinson (Christian Advocate, VI, No. 3 [Febru- ary 1, 1962], 11-12; and Union Seminary Quarterly Review, XVII [1962], 359-62). Hopefully, the fol- lowing argument makes clear that, although, like any other Christian theologian, I do indeed affirm Jesus Christ as the decisive act of God, I under- stand this affirmation in a sense somewhat different from Bultmann and Robinson and thus in a sense that, unlike theirs, is not inconsistent with thor- oughgoing demythologizing and existentialist inter- pretation. 31.
