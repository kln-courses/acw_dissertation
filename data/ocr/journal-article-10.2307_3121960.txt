In particular, it argues that, all too often, metaphors are misunderstood because they are interpreted literally. Examples of primary school children's writing are provided to illustrate the problem of literalism in religious understanding. The article concludes by recommending the extensive teaching of metaphor throughout education. 1. THE NATURE OF METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE Metaphorical language is used continually throughout human efforts to communicate insights and experiences which are beyond the scope of straight description. Metaphor is a particularly powerful device for conveying meaning. Which of the following, for example, is the more intriguing statement: * I think I fell in love with this stupid man * Methought I was enamoured of an ass (Shakespeare, pub 1967) The mind is actively and creatively involved in constructing and either accepting or rejecting possible meanings, and remains alert to new possibilities. How lacking in vigour is the first statement in comparison! Was Shakespeare using 'ass' metaphorically? Certainly, Bottom had developed the head of an ass, but not the tail, paws, or other parts of the appropriate anatomy! The reader or spectator is left to make sense of the episode by creative thinking, particularly by the use of comparisons. However, problems occur when metaphor is not recognised as being such. For literal interpretation of figurative writing removes 381</page><page sequence="2">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING from the metaphor the power it possesses to convey insights and, even more seriously, leads to the probabilities of misunderstandings arising which, once having become established, are extremely difficult to open up to discussion and further reflection. Nowhere is such misunderstanding more clearly portrayed than in thinking concerning religion. The comments which follow came from children living in economic- ally disadvantaged areas within inner-city housing estates. The children were all of western European origin. The statements were gathered as a result of empirical research during which children were asked to write on paper their ideas of God, Jesus and Heaven. This is significant in that the method used for the data collection ensured that the children had no cues as to what the researcher might be seeking. Rather, the ideas expressed by the children represented the concepts which had been formed as a result of their experiences both in and out of school. The following came from a child concerning her ideas of God: God is a man and he lives in the sky. We pray to him. He made the planets and he made all the flowers and he is the man who made the world (Nine-year old). Encapsulated in the child's words is the stereotyped concept of God which has been handed from one generation to the next throughout many centuries: God is male, lives in the sky, and bears responsibility for the whole of creation. It has been shown elsewhere (Petrovich, 1988) that such ideas are not natural to childhood but are actually taught. There arise from this a number of interesting points: * how and why have such concepts taken form and development? e how helpful are such concepts in enabling children understand religious language and symbolism? * in which direction should religious education in schools be moving in order to help students think in depth about religion in an informed manner? The writer taught children aged between six and eleven years in primary schools for over nineteen years. As a result of this experience, the concepts which the children had formed came as no surprise, representing as they do popularised ideas of religious doctrine. Age of children does not correlate with any development of religious understanding, other than, as will be shown, a gradual rejection of these popularised ideas on the grounds that they are unscientific. The problem seems to lie in the content of much language teaching, and 382 ) Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="3">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING religious education especially, which fails to develop children's potential to understand the use of metaphor and other forms of symbolic expression. The result is the development of crude anthropo- morphism, which eventually leads to literalism. This is extremely effective in the subsequent rejection of religion on the basis of uninformed understanding. There is evidence that the misunderstanding is so deep that few people actually know it even exists - that God is thought of in terms as an old man in the sky and that such belief may be demonstrated by pointing towards great works of art such as Michelangelo's figures on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. Such lack of understanding of the use of religious symbol and metaphor has two opposite but related main effects: * The idea of God as man is accepted and defended dogmatically; * The whole idea of religion is rejected on the basis of the misunderstanding, in that modern scientific studies have proved religion to be false. Evidence may be found of how such ideas are reinforced by the Christian Church by examining, for example, the Alternative Service Book of the Church of England, in particular the Communion Rite A Service. Here it will be found that the metaphor 'father' for God is used at least eighteen times if the First Eucharistic Prayer is used, and possibly more if other optional material is included in worship. The total absence of other metaphors is striking, as is evidence that congregations are provided with opportunities for learning how God may be understood in terms of 'father'. Such teaching is essential if both children and adults are to be helped to understand religion. The situation is particularly surprising in the present climate when we are constantly informed by the media that the traditional family unit, headed by a father, is becoming increasingly rare. To the child, or even adult, within a single-parent family, or from an unhappy or broken home, the concept held of a 'father' is likely to be very different from that held by someone from a Jewish family from the first Christian century (see Watson, 1972). Yet it was within such Jewish traditions that Jesus Christ first introduced the 'father' metaphor among many others. 2. METAPHORICAL IMAGES OF GOD The origins of the misunderstanding are not difficult to find, but first some discussion will follow which examines biblical metaphors of God 383 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="4">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING to discover what the original texts were attempting to teach. We may read in the Jewish scriptures: So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them (Genesis 1, v 27) The image of God according to which the human race was created is not, in fact, explicitly made known. Vriezen (1962: 129) discusses how the Jewish scriptures show that knowledge of God is something altogether different from developing concepts of God. The problem in communication develops when the personal attributes of God are to be expressed, for to attempt to do so is difficult without detracting from the idea of God's transcendence. Eichrodt (1961: 211) makes this point, but also refers to the dangers of anthropomorphism: There can be no doubt that among the great mass of the people, and especially in the earlier period (i.e. the pre-Christian era), the deity was frequently conceived as restricted to physical modes of living and self-manifestation. They understood the anthropo- morphic expressions in a quite literal and concrete way, and so managed to acquire a most inadequate conception of the divine supremacy. Viriezen (1962) discusses how these anthropomorphisms are 'evidence of the inadequacy of human speech about God, but they also bear witness to the living relation to Him that compels the faithful to speak of Him.' (p. 173). Nowhere are we told that God is a man, although the use of 'him' and 'his' could suggest this; the point will be taken up later. Both 'he' and 'his' occur in both English and Hebrew. In any but recent writings we would hardly expect anything else. The question of the maleness of the Jewish concept of God gives rise to much anxiety today (see McFague, 1983, for example). The issues raised give prime examples of why the whole question of metaphor needs attention. The feminist movement does have a point, namely, that if certain metaphors are emphasized and not others, many people will take them literally. This is what has happened concerning the maleness of God. As a corrective, other metaphors, such as 'light', are required to provide balance to the ideas and insights which are being communicated. As the Creation narrative unfolds, it becomes obvious that it is with this principle of goodness that the Creator is concerned and wishes to sustain and develop; this is a possible interpretation of the story of Noah, and of the traditions surrounding YHWH's concern for the 384 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="5">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING Hebrew race - the chosen people. When evil comes into conflict with good, it is the latter with which God has to deal - God is concerned about goodness! The opening verses of Genesis tell us that 'the spirit of God moved upon the waters' and that approval was given to creation, in its entirety, in that it was good. In the original Hebrew, the word ruach (usually translated as 'spirit') is something which emanates from God, representing Him. But, as Vriezen (1962) points out, ruach also exists independently beside God (p. 248). It is through personal relationships with the 'ruach' that knowledge of God develops, but the 'secret of God's own Being is never encroached upon' (Virezen, 1962: 130). Anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms are necessary in order to express knowledge of the spiritual God which has resulted from the communion, or relationship, which has developed. When describing the relationship between God and Ecclesiastes, Virezen (1962: 173) writes: ... the two elements, the personal and the anthropomorphic, are always closely connected. But whenever there is knowledge of God, communion with God, all reserves imposed by reason are abandoned consciously or unconsciously, and human feelings and a human shape are attributed to God without any hesitation. This was clearly understood by early Christian writers such as the following: We cannot know God in his greatness, for the Father cannot be measured. But by his love ... we ever learn, in obeying him that this great God exists ... (Bettenson, 1956: 66). These comments of Irenaeus, who lived during the first two centuries of Christianity, are echoed to some extent by a slightly later Christian writer, Basil of Caesarea who does not, it should be noted, use the word 'he': When we hear the title 'Spirit' we cannot picture a name circumscribed, or subject ot change and variation, or in any way resembling created beings. It is inevitable that our imagination should proceed to the highest point so that we should conceive an intellectual substance of infinite power, of unlimited magnitude, not measurable by times or ages, unstinting of its good gifts; a being to which all turn when needing satisfaction. (Bettenson, 1970: 71) Thus, the use of 'spirit' as a metaphor of God, as described in the passage quoted, invites the creative, imaginative capacity of the 385 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="6">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING reader to 'proceed to the highest point' - highest not in a spatial sense, but rather within an abstract framework of awareness of Truth itself. Throughout the Jewish scriptures metaphors of God reflect this original image of goodness, which becomes intensified by the addition of others. Thus insight into the purposes of God is compared to a burning bush (Exodus 3, v 1), a metaphor which indicates awareness of the presence of God; other attributes, or characteristics of God, are enlikened to a rock, a fortress and a deliverer: I will love thee, O Lord, my strength, The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer. My God, my strength, in whom I will trust (Psalm 18). God is a rock in that strength and endurance are characteristics of this power; a fortress because of the security and safety afforded by the power of the good, and a deliverer in that the spirit is enabled to develop towards perfection, which is the ultimate goal of creation. This image of God as being 'the good' may be followed through succeeding centuries. Light, a metaphor closely associated with images of both God and Jesus Christ, is found frequently in Christian scriptures. Thus St John writes of Christ: That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world (St. John, 1. v 9). This echoes light as a metaphor of God in Jewish scriptures: The Lord is my light and my salvation (Psalm 27) God as light is a metaphor which echoes again the opening verses of Genesis, where we are told: And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep . .. and God said Let there be light. (Genesis 1, v 1-4) The fact that so many metaphors of God are used points towards the absolute inadequacy of any single one of them to fully express and communicate the insight which the believer feels s/he has experienced. Each metaphor acts as a type of signpost: the way to what is believed as being Truth is pointed towards, but neither language nor symbol (or straight description, certainly) is able to reach fully the ultimate source of reality. 386 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="7">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING 3. GOD AS A MAN - A MISUNDERSTANDING Why should crude anthropomorphism have developed from human efforts to form concepts of God? There are many possible answers to this question, including lack of reflection. Both anthropomorphism and anthropopathism are widely used in expressing insights throughout religious writings and other areas of experience, but like any metaphor, become unhelpful when understood literally. Literalism seems to occur because of the existential position of the reader/communicant who does not share the experience with the person communicating the experience. The inability to handle metaphor is central to the misunder- standing. Thus, when the word 'father' is used the image which arises in the mind immediately is that of a male figure, rather than attributes which, in individual experience, that figure possessed. Eichrodt (1960: 212) makes the point that in Christianity the transcendence of God had the opportunity of being strengthened by the position of Jesus Christ: it was Christ who provided the personal, immanent focus for understanding. However, failure to recognise the metaphorical use of 'father' to describe the relationship between God and Christ has given rise to serious problems. When the word 'father' is used the image which arises in the mind, especially in the mind of a young child, is easily developed in spatial terms by hymns, prayers and stories which emphasize bodily characteristics, such as a voice, hands, and the use of pronouns such as 'his' and 'him'. There can be little doubt that it is this type of teaching which has produced ideas in children such as the following: I think God is a big person with a long white beard. He looks down on us from the sky. I think everybody should believe in God because if he was not here we would not have Bibles about him (Eight-year-old). These spatial ideas are extended to heaven, and are equally unhelpful in enabling the child understand something about religion: God lives in heaven. Jesus is his son. God is kind and good. He does not hate anyone. Wherever you go, he is always with you. If you have been bad he sends you down to the devil. The devil treats you as a slave - you must obey him at all times but in heaven it is much better. It says in the Bible that you can see anyone you want who is in heaven (Ten-year-old). 387 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="8">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING The interpretation of the metaphor of Jesus as Son of God is literal too; its original meaning - that ofJesus being close to God in spiritual principle in a similar way to the closeness of a Jewish boy to his father - has been lost. These examples of writing from primary school children typify concepts of God found by other researchers (Rogers, 1983; Loukes, 1961; Gates, 1976; Watson, 1972; Heller, 1985; Spain, 1978) and point towards the inadequacy of education in providing children with the skills necessary in order to develop some understanding of the non-literal use of language, and why such is necessary in order to describe insights which transcend straight description and analysis. That some new approach to education, the teaching of literacy and religious education in particular, be developed is a matter of urgency. The following examples of children's writing show how easily atheism develops as a result of religious literalism: I don't believe in God. I've heard of stories at school and I sing songs but I don't go to church. People say he speaks, but I've not heard him though (Eleven-year-old). I don't believe in God because if he is so great why does he not end the famine and drought and the fighting in the world. Why does he let people die and make boats sink and planes crash? How come we cannot see, hear or touch him? (Eleven-year-old). As the second example of children's writing shows, religious education in the classroom is not helping children reflect in an informed manner regarding such questions as the reasons for disasters, both natural and otherwise. It is clear that the child who wrote this is concerned about famine, droughts and other incidents which cause human suffering, but also that religious education is not seen as offering a means by which such may be understood. The final comments show that the child, conceptually, remains locked within crude anthropomorphic concepts. It is these which cause the rejection of religion, even though they do not reflect what religion is about. The first example indicates that the diet of stories and songs, together with ideas about God 'speaking', bear no relation at all to the child's daily life and concerns. The 'speech' of God is understood literally, and is therefore unhelpful in developing children's under- standing and further questioning. Do children of primary school age have the intellectual capacity to understand metaphor? It has been argued elsewhere (Ashton, 1993, Matthews, 1980 and 1984; Petrovich, 1988; Tizard, 1984) that much of what young children talk about ought to be understood as 388 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="9">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING metaphorical thinking, rather than factual, scientific reasoning. It has been argued (Tizard, et al. 1984) that children's natural tendencies to think creatively and imaginatively are discouraged during their progress through the education system. This happens because children are encouraged to understand by reference to literal truth, rather than the encouragement and fostering of their earlier tend- encies as a parallel development. It is in connections such as these that age is important: throughout Key Stage Two there is a gradual lessening of creative thinking in favour of scientific reasoning, with a corresponding development of problems associated with literalism. In this connection, the following piece of writing is interesting: Heaven reminds me of the clouds because they are beautiful and make you feel good. Heaven reminds me of a hoover picking up dust off the carpet. I think of it because my mum hoovers every night (Nine-year-old). What did the child mean? It is obvious that he is writing in metaphor because he cannot describe his ideas in any other way. When attempting to decipher his thoughts one is led to compare one's own concept of heaven with the act of hoovering - removing something unwanted, perhaps, or making something ready for a fresh start. The metaphor, however obscure, is effective in that is stimulates reflection in order to understand and therefore communicate, and in addition one is left wondering whether some point has evaded analysis. 4. THE WAY FORWARD IN RELIGIOUS EDUCATION Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, Local Education Authorities have been engaged in rewriting their Agreed Syllabuses of Religious Education. When reading through a random selection of these it was obvious that some understanding is developing of the need to teach children how to both recognise and use language which embodies metaphor in order to convey meaning. The following are examples: (children will) ... study forms of communication and expression of religious ideas and meanings through, for example, ritual and ceremony, symbol and poetic language (Syllabus, Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames, 1990). ... many of the social facts of religion can be studied with that of understanding how language and non-verbal forms can be employed in the realm of religion; the teacher has the task of giving pupils an insight into what such forms refer to, what experiences underlie them (Syllabus, Hereford and Worcester, 1992). 389 ? Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="10">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING ... to study traditions of Christianity and other faiths ... as expressed through the use of language and symbols ... (Syllabus, Oldham Education Authority, 1990). ... to discover something about religious language ... (Syllabus, London Borough of Ealing, 1989). ... discover some of the ways in which the Bible describes God, e.g. Shepherd, rock, Lord, and the quest for meaning and purpose of life as reflected in non-Biblical literature (Syllabus, Gateshead M.B.C. 1992). ... pupils should explore non-literal use of language ... (Bromley Guidelines for RE, 1992/3). ... come to an understanding of the nature and use of language in religion (Syllabus, Cornwall County Council). These signs are very hopeful. If the importance of children under- standing the non-literal use of language, both in religion and literature (the latter is required by the National Curriculum English documentation), becomes generally recognised and accepted, the teaching of metaphor may become rather more widespread than being considered to be either a narrow, specialised subject, or a mere figure of speech. To be able to use metaphor in both speech, writing and reading is to be able to free the mind from the narrow constraints of daily living and to foresee possibilities and purposes in life creatively. This is because the very act of making comparisons deepens insights on account of the reflective thinking which is required. Religion can then be freed from the bonds of relativism, since students could be enabled to identify personal concerns and priorities within a framework of religious faith and teachings which provide opportunities for a deepening of understanding through reflection. In planning the content of lessons, particularly lessons in the understanding and use of language, it is necessary to build upon children's initial interest in imaginative thinking throughout Key Stages One and Two. Emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of helping young people understand that non-literal use of language is a method of expressing a reality which cannot be described literally, since the nature of the insights being expressed transcend words. Religious Education in England and Wales has moved through some interesting phases of development during the past three decades especially. The 'Goldman Era' (Goldman, 1964 and 1965) was succeeded in many schools by the Phenomenological Movement 390 V Basil Blackwell Ltd. and SCSE 1993</page><page sequence="11">LITERALISM IN LANGUAGE USE AND RELIGIOUS THINKING which studied the outward aspects of religion, while presently we are experiencing the Experiential Learning Movement (Hay et al. 1990). Evidence of all these developments may be found in schools today and, indeed, the earlier, so-called 'confessional' approach has persisted despite efforts to dislodge it on the grounds that it was indoctrinatory. Perhaps, judging by the comments of some of the children quoted here, failure to indoctrinate is the most outstandingly remarkable feature of confessionalism. Attempting to distance children from personal engagement with religious belief in the fear of indoctrinating them has brought about the interesting development of a denial of ultimate authority. As Watson (1987) has written: (the) ... relativist assumption is extremely pervasive and subtly damaging to education; it inhibits any in-depth discussion of the values necessary to education by assuming from the start that they are subjective and just a matter of consensus (p. 28). Could there be connections with the present Parliamentary Debate concerning the need to educate children in values? The key to doing so undoubtedly is to teach the skills of reflective thinking. Young children in the primary school are quite capable of such thinking and, indeed, seem to use metaphorical discourse from very early years. It is this capacity upon which education should be focusing, for then the creative potential of children would enable them to develop sensitivity and sympathy towards both other people and the created world in general. 5.
