Bog Standard?</page><page sequence="2">Since 2000 the Irish Archaeological Wetland Unit (IAWU) has been conducting annual surveys of Bord na M?na's Derrygreenagh bogs in counties Offaly, Westmeath and Meath on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The results of these surveys have added an extra dimension to the history of peatland exploitation and have done a great deal towards dispelling the notion that bog roads are the sole topic of peatland archaeology. As the sites and finds featured below amply demonstrate, peatland archaeology continues to offer invaluable opportunities for the analysis of past economies, settlement and beliefs through material evidence that rarely survives elsewhere. An early Bronze Age bowstave from Barrysbrook A yew bowstave was recovered from Barrysbrook townland in 2001 during the survey of Ballybeg Bog in east Offaly (see Archaeology Ireland No. 59). Located 5km south-east of Rochfortbridge, the bog is situated at the eastern side of Croghan Hill and forms one of a chain of bogs surrounding the hill. The bowstave was recovered ex situ from a water-filled drain close to the western side of the bog. It is 1.36m in surviving length, believed to have been c. 1.8m long when complete, with a knock or terminal surviving on the intact end. Damage and splitting occur along 62.8cm of the surviving length. Owing to the condition of the piece it is not possible to examine the D-shaped cross-section to determine the sapwood-heartwood boundary. The intact knock is rounded in form with a single small perforation. The stave has been trimmed along its length, curving inward slightly at the terminal, although no tool-marks are evident. Although recovered from a disturbed context, the assemblage of sites in the bog proved to be of prehistoric date and in consultation with the National Museum of Ireland it was decided to date the bowstave. This date has recently been returned as 2399-2042 cal. BC, making it the earliest known bowstave in Ireland. Although a number of prehistoric British bowstaves are known, such as those from Rotton Bottom, Meare Heath and Eddington Burtle, the Barrysbrook bowstave is only the second known prehistoric bowstave identified in Ireland. The other example, from Drumwhinny Bog, Co. Fermanagh, has been dated to 1680-1326 cal. BC and only 17cm of one terminal survives. As previously reported, the Barrysbrook bowstave forms part of an assemblage of over a hundred sites and artefacts from Ballybeg Bog. This assemblage was confirmed as prehistoric by a number of dates spanning the period from the late Neolithic to the late Bronze Age/Iron Age. These sites range from a considerable number of wooden trackways and smaller sites to two large wooden _ platforms, a stone enclosure and a possible occupation site consisting of a spread of stone and charcoal from which a polished stone adze and ten worked flints were recovered. Charcoal from this latter site produced the earliest date at 2562-2200 cal. BC, and the stone enclosure is probably contemporary. The substantial structures appear to be situated on the southern limit of a former lake (possibly the precursor of a lake to the north indicated on early maps as Loughnashade) or merely an area of seasonal flooding. The larger of the platforms (c. 19m x 71m) was dated to 2576-2294 cal. BC and the smaller one (c. 13m x 14m) to 2282-1952 cal. BC. The bowstave was recovered 250m south west of the smaller, westernmost platform. The dating of the bowstave and its broad contemporaneity with the platform structures, occupation site and enclosure highlight the possibility that some of these structures may be associated with hunting. Unfortunately it was not possible to determine whether the bowstave was deliberately deposited. In recent surveys leaf shaped and barbed and tanged arrowheads have been found in increasing numbers. While most of these were stray finds, four were recovered in close association in Cloncreen Bog and may have been deliberately deposited rather than lost (see Archaeology Ireland No. 62). In contrast to many other peatland surveys, the sites in Ballybeg Bog are not situated on the bog margins but are centrally - located around a wetter area, which appears to have been a focus of activity. It has previously been suggested that some of the sites in Ballybeg Bog may reflect the ceremonial character of ritual monuments on Croghan Hill and the surrounding dryland. In this context, while obviously used for hunting, the deposition of the bowstave may have been ceremonial, suggesting a plurality of function for sites in peatland environments. vl &lt; Facing page, top: Close-up of 'neck' and 'head' of anthropomorphic 'figure'.

Offaly, 5km south-east of Daingean town. A total of 44 sites were recorded, including trackways, post rows, deposits of archaeological wood, a habitation site and two artefacts. The majority of sites lie in the south-east corner, the lowest and narrowest portion of the bog, with a smaller concentration in the north-eastern portion. Two of the longest trackways in the southern area have been dendro-dated to 1454 ? 9 BC and 1425 ? 9 BC, and it is highly likely that the remaining sites are also prehistoric, if not broadly contemporary. Habitation site One of the most significant discoveries of the survey is the habitation site, which consists of a subcircular palisade (19.8m in diameter) enclosing a central house platform. Located in Ballintemple townland in the north-east portion of the bog, the site lies some 500m from the modern dryland. Settlement sites in bogs are rare and those that have been identified generally occur near lakeshores; however, this isolated site was constructed on raised bog with no apparent large bodies of water nearby. Although not completely exposed, the palisade appears to be constructed of a double row of posts, which was partially the case at the lakeside settlement of Cullyhanna Lough, Co. Antrim. It seems to be constructed exclusively of ash posts, a feature also recorded at the lakeside settlement of Clonfinlough, Co. Offaly. There is some 22 evidence of wattling around the southern side of the palisade but it is unknown whether this continues around its entire circumference. The absence of large quantities of brushwood around the site suggests that this is not the case and wattle may only have been employed in this area. Within the palisade a platform of timbers and roundwoods forms a substantial surface containing a large hearth. Two corners of the hearth are supported with c. 60 closely set posts, and there is an entranceway of brushwood, bark and timbers on the west side. There are two arcs of stakes which in all likelihood join to form a double wall enclosing the platform. Ten artefacts were recovered from the field surface, the majority of which were ex situ and damaged by milling. They consist of three pieces of flint, a chert core, two possible whetstones, fragments of a small sandstone disc, two leather fragments and a small quantity of burnt bone, probably animal. A very similar structure, although unenclosed, was recorded in peatland at Caraghoge, Co. Monaghan. Although undated, it is believed to be prehistoric. The interpretation of the structure as a habitation site is based on a number of factors. The scale of the structure clearly suggests permanent occupation, although intensive seasonal use cannot be ruled out. For instance, the arcs of stakes interpreted as walls may simply have formed windbreaks protecting the hearth against the prevailing south-westerly wind. In this regard it is notable that the only evidence of wattling on the palisade is on its south-western side. A comparable windbreak structure was recorded at Cullyhanna Lough. The burnt bone recovered from the hearth area suggests its use for cooking, and the remaining artefacts appear to be domestic in character. Pending excavation and dating results, it currently appears that the structure at Ballintemple shares a number of significant traits with wetland sites of the middle to late Bronze Age, including Cullyhanna Lough and Clonfinlough, dated to 1526 BC and 908 ? 9 BC respectively. A small number of very slightly concave metal tool-marks and the whetstones support the use of metal at Ballintemple. In addition, the two middle Bronze Age trackways to the south suggest a late prehistoric date. Nonetheless, the features shared with these settlements may be This page, left: Survey plan of habitation site. Above: Detail of house structure. Facing page, left: Anthropomorphic 'figure' in situ.

Circumspection is required in projecting a Bronze Age date to the northern site distribution as milling began in the southern portion of the bog and was extended northward ten years later. The exposed peats can be expected to be somewhat later here and an early medieval date cannot be discounted. If the site is prehistoric, it will be one of a small number of key wetland sites in Offaly, including Ballinderry 2 and Clonfinlough, which represent almost all of the prehistoric settlement evidence in the county. Anthropomorphic 'figure7 An equally exciting discovery from Ballykean was an anthropomorphic wooden 'figure' recovered from Kilbeg townland. The figure was found in isolation within the south-eastern site distribution. It consists of a curved roundwood, 2.31m in length, heavily damaged on one side. It is worked to a point at one end, beyond which is a short un worked portion retaining bark. The remainder of the object has been finely dressed, and eleven narrow notches with straight edges are cut across its width. At the opposite end the wood has been worked into a narrow 'neck', where it has broken. Originally attached to the neck was a bulbous 'head', which survives in two pieces. The wood has been identified as alder and is in very good condition, with no decay indicative of prolonged exposure (I. Stuijts, pers. comm.). This may indicate that the figure was deliberately deposited in a horizontal position soon after its creation, which is noteworthy as the worked point might lead one to speculate that the object was intended to sit upright. Over the last two years, six similarly enigmatic wooden objects have been recovered from Cloncreen Bog, c. 7km north-east of Ballykean. Four were discovered by the IAWU in 2002, with two further examples identified by ADS Ltd last summer (see Archaeolog}' Ireland No. 65). These are roundwoods 0.43-2.2m in length with whole or partial surface dressing and various incised V-shaped notches. Four in particular have notches and terminals reminiscent of the Kilbeg figure and are also arguably anthropomorphic in form. Most lay within or beneath structures, and this is paralleled at Corlea, Co. Longford, and at Wittemoor in Germany, where figures were discovered in association with trackways. The Kilbeg artefact appears to be an isolated find, but as it has incurred severe damage it is possible that material originally associated with it has since been destroyed. Given that the artefact was situated between the two middle Bronze Age trackways, it is highly likely that it too is Bronze Age in date. A similar date was returned for material associated with one of the Cloncreen examples. Anthropomorphic wooden figures from various periods are known throughout Europe, with a particular concentration in northern Germany and Denmark. Two explicitly anthropomorphic Irish examples are known from Lagore and Ralaghan, dating from the early and late Bronze Age respectively, but do not directly parallel the stylised Kilbeg figure. The Corlea figure dates from the Iron Age, and although considerably simpler than the Kilbeg example it too has a 'neck' and bulbous 'head'. Many Continental figures exhibit carved 'necks' and 'heads', but notches are less frequent. The best parallel is a 'goddess figure' (1.05m long) from Rebild in Denmark, dated to the Roman Iron Age, which has five straight-edged notches towards its base. The notches and form of the Rebild 'head', rather than the Irish examples, most closely compare with the Kilbeg figure. The discovery of this figure raises many questions relating to its social significance. While part of a pan-European tradition, its occurrence in relatively close proximity to the Cloncreen artefacts poses tantalising regional questions. That bogs often functioned as theatres of ritual is a common proposition in archaeological writing, and Ballykean Bog sits comfortably within this tradition. The argument that this bog accommodated more than economic activity is strengthened by the discovery of four bronze Y-shaped objects in its north-western corner in 2000. Such objects are Iron Age in date and are generally believed to have formed part of a horse harness. These were deposited together in an area that was recorded as the source of a spring by the Bog Commissioners in the early nineteenth century. This find might plausibly be interpreted as a ritual deposition, and the occurrence of the Kilbeg figure may yet prove to be a forerunner of such practices. Conclusion The discoveries outlined above go beyond the standard bog assemblages and offer insight into the true breadth and complexity of human activity in peatlands and beyond. The multifaceted nature of the use of peatland environments during the prehistoric period is now well established, and the ability of peatland archaeology to inform debate on the wider cultural landscape is increasing with each season.
