<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON AND THE CONJECTURA CABBALISTICA' By R. J. Zwi Werblowsky Since Professor Saurat published his truly astounding discovery of Zoharic doctrines in Paradise Lost," his conclusions have been accepted, albeit with reserve, by most scholars.3 Dissent is voiced mainly on points of detail, and the focus of the battle is the doctrine of tsimtsum or retraction in the by now notorious passage, Paradise Lost, vii, 168 f. Thus Mr. Lewis4 agrees that "one of Professor Saurat's great contributions has been to discover the doctrine in the Zohar which was almost certainly in Milton's mind when he wrote these verses. ... I do not think such an idea likely to have struck two writers independently, and I allow to Professor Saurat that Milton has been influenced by the Zohar when he speaks of God 'retiring Himself'." Mr. Lewis' only quarrel with Professor Saurat is on the question whether this doctrine, either in its Miltonic or "Zoharic" form, is heretical or not. Professor Sewell, who denies any trace of the tsimtsum in Paradise Lost5 yet admits that Saurat "may well be right in supposing that Milton had read the Zohar and had used it for his own purposes."8 The significant fact about the criticisms of the kabbalistic theory is that they all come from Milton scholars and not from students of the Kabbalah. Their reserve springs from doubts whether the Miltonic passages in question really bear the interpretation forced upon them as a result of the kabbalistic "parallels," and not from any acquaintance with the kabbalistic texts themselves for which they only have the word of M. Saurat. It may, therefore, be useful to reopen the whole question from a kabbalistic point of view. Not so much, perhaps, with a view to putting right a rather minor point, but with the purpose of exposing a situation which is symptomatic for the way in which "kabbalistic" material is used in much modern scholarship. The ill-fated "Milton and the Zohar" theory may thus at least have the merit of serving as a warning example. A few introductory remarks on kabbalistic studies may be pertinent here, because the layman is easily misled into thinking that the difficulty lies only 1 Conjectura Cabbalistica here does not refer to Henry More's Threefold Cabala, the relation of which to Milton has been fully discussed by Miss M. H. Nicolson in an essay of the same title (Philological Quarterly, VI, 1927, pp. 1-18). The expression is meant here to refer loosely to all theories purporting to find influences of the Zohar or other kabbalistic sources in Paradise Lost. I prefer to speak here of "Milton and the Kabbalah" and not of "Milton and the Zohar" for the simple reason that, as I hope to show, no direct relation exists between Paradise Lost and the Zohar, whereas kabbalistic influences of a special kind on Milton can be demonstrated. 2 Milton Man and Thinker, 1944.

But in fact it lies with the gross ignorance of the so-called "experts" with regard to the history, language and meaning of the Kabbalah. Kabbalistic language and terminology are so peculiar that trained Hebraists do not necessarily understand them, and even a Jew who is brought up on Hebrew and Rabbinic studies needs special initiation to master such a text. Non-Jewish studies on the subject are too often devoid of any value, as only few authors, like A. E. Waite,1 could redeem their ignorance in philo- logical and historical matters by a genuine and intuitive insight into the mystical motives and doctrines. More frequently, much that goes by the name of Kabbalah is a hopeless mixture of sheer humbug, occultism, rosi- crucianism, exotic theosophy and general infatuation with "secret lore." Jewish kabbalists, for the most part, kept aloof from the world of western scholarship. Their utter lack of interest and contacts thus left ample scope for dilettantism of the worst sort.2 This deplorable situation has changed since G. Scholem's pioneer work put kabbalistic studies on a solid scientific basis. Though most of his writings presuppose first-hand acquaintance with the sources and are written in Hebrew, his great work Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism3 has revolutionized the whole situation by placing in the hands of the non-hebraist and layman a reliable and authoritative account of the subject. A major part of the Zohar too is at last accessible in a comparatively reliable translation.4 To begin with, it is necessary to draw a clear distinction between Jewish and Christian Kabbalah. The former represents the more mystical or theosophic side of Judaism, and, in a narrower and more precise sense, that phase of it which developed or emerged in the thirteenth century.5 "Christian Kabbalah" is the fragmentary and often misunderstood knowledge of the Kabbalah acquired by Christian scholars, and their use of it for building their own systems. It developed as a typical Renaissance and post-Renaissance phenomenon, and its beginnings were closely connected with the Neoplatonic and syncretistic tendencies of the Medicean Academy at Florence.6 The first 1 The Holy Kabbalah, 1930, incorporating his earlier The Secret Doctrine of Israel, 1913. 2 Cf.

J. ZWI WERBLOWSKY generations of Christian kabbalists, often instructed by Jewish teachers, did really possess some sound though fragmentary knowledge of the subject, as witnessed, for example, by Reuchlin's progress between the publication of his De Verbo Mirifico (1494) and De Arte Cabbalistica (1516). Knorr von Rosenroth too (Kabbala Denudata, I677-I684) shows first-hand acquaintance with his sources. Most other authors, however, were content to copy from Pico, Reuchlin, Riccius and others. From the seventeenth century onward ignor- ance increased steadily until the term "kabbalistic scholarship" was hardly more than a euphemism for unbridled theosophical speculation. The know- ledge of sources amounted to the Latin of Knorr's Kabbala Denudata. With this record of "Kabbalah" outside Judaism, the fact that the very first occurrence of that term in Christian writings has nothing to do with Kabbalah proper and is, moreover, centuries later than traditionally believed, almost assumes symbolic significance.' As a historical survey of the development of Christian Kabbalah is out- side our present scope, we cannot but hint at its interaction with the temper and mental climate of the age in which it arose. However rapidly Kabbalah may have disappeared from the main stream of European thought, there is no doubt that it provided powerful stimuli. The syncretistic dispositions to which it answered and the Neoplatonic speculations which it fertilized gained such momentum that its specific Jewish contents and significances soon receded into the background. The word Kabbalah became completely divorced from its original context as is illustrated by the aforementioned pseudo-Lullian treatise, or by the bland assertion of Henry More,2 that the Platonists had "more of that Cabbala than the Jews themselves have at this day." In fact, More is quite convinced "to have light upon the old true Cabbala" by his own speculations.3 This statement is commendable for its reserve when compared, for example, with W. Wynn Westcott's claim4 to have taught kabbalistic doctrines in rosicrucian and hermetic societies which had never been pub- lished and are not to be found in any Hebrew book! Two main trends are to be discerned in Christian Kabbalah. The speci- fically "Christian" one in its narrowest sense is mainly concerned with adducing proof from kabbalistic texts for the Trinity and other Christological dogmas. This tradition was founded by Pico and Reuchlin, and though it was based on genuine kabbalistic learning, it had little in common with the fundamental interests of Kabbalah proper.5 These Renaissance kabbalists and their followers were mainly concerned with applying the more mechanical kabbalistic techniques of scriptural interpretation (gematriah, notarikon, themurah etc.) to establish the truths of Christianity as their hidden meaning. Similarly, they tried to use the "sephirotic tree" as an illustration of Trinitarian and Christological doctrines. As Henry More put it, "Christ is nothing but Moses 1 The treatise De Auditu kabbalistico, tradi- tionally ascribed to Raymundus Lullus (1232- I316) is really a I6th-century writing; cf. Scholem's article in the Leo Baeck Jubilee volume. 2 Conjectura Cabbalistica, 1653, "The De- fence of the Philosophick Cabbala," p. 142.

Kabbal. 3 Op. cit., Preface. 4 An Introduction to the Study of the Kabbalah, 1926, p. 8. 5 See infra.</page><page sequence="4">MILTON AND THE CONJECTURA CABBALISTICA 93 unveiled," and for the kabbalists Moses meant not only the Pentateuch but the whole of esoteric tradition. In a way the most wrong-headed manifesta- tion of this Kabbalah is also the most illuminating and instructive. In De Verbo Mirifico Reuchlin proves that the "wondrous name," i.e. the penta- grammaton IHSUH fulfils and completes that which was only partially revealed in the kabbalistic letter-mysticism of the tri- and tetra-gram- maton.1 The other trend is more philosophical. In fact, its main concern is natural philosophy and not theosophy. It is this trend which is of importance in seventeenth-century England. Henry More and his contemporaries deeply felt the spiritual threat of the widening gulf between traditional religion and the "new philosophy," i.e., science, and especially the new cosmology.2 They tried to offer an alternative to the Bacon-Descartes line by elaborating a system based on a more unified outlook as it was also championed by, for example, Robert Boyle. More was so convinced of the possibilities of such a synthesis, that at first he even hailed Descartes for supplying the one side of the medal, fully confident that he himself was able to use Platonic speculation as the other side and thus supply the unified, catholic vision. He bewailed the dissociation in outlook, "the unhappy disjunction of the Physical part of the Cabbala from the Metaphysical in Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus" and set himself to re-uniting them again. If the natural philosophers had erred on the one side, theologians had erred on the other by paying too little con- sideration to natural science. The philosophy of Descartes was therefore a welcome "restauration of the physicall part of the Mosaick philosophy." The division of intellectual labour, as envisaged by More, was to be such that Plato should provide the soul, Descartes the body of the same philosophy.3 This resurrection of the principles of the "Most Ancient Philosophy" was not due to a mere desire to go back to the past, but was part of a broad attempt to make Christian religion consistent with the new science of the century, i.e., x A few titles chosen at random will illus- trate this trend in kabbalistic literature: (i) Elchanan Paulus: Mysterium Novum.

It was, in fact, the problem of the "extension" of the soul that led to More's later repudiation of Descartes. More felt that in order to be real at all, the soul ought to have extension of some sort, though he always remained less radical and consistent a Neoplatonist than his friend Lady Conway who frankly maintained that soul and body differed only in modo but not in essentia (The Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy, I692).

Jh ZWI WERBLOWSKY Cartesianism.1 The Kabbalah was felt to be a bridge to this aim, and though More's reaction at his first reading of "Cabalisticall papyrs"2 was as if he had "lickt a peece of rough iron" with his tongue, after a second perusal he no longer doubted "but there is pretious gold in this Cabbalisticall rubbish, which the discerning eye will easily discover." Since both reason and Scripture are divinely true, both must be interpreted on more than one level, and either may be used to illuminate the other. To refuse to go beyond the outer, literal sense of Scripture to the profounder level of "Mosaicall Philosophy" is almost the same heresy as the denial of the inner, spiritual meaning of the Sacra- ments.3 The same perfectly integrated and unified outlook is exhibited with an engaging naivete by Robert Fludd.4 Here peace reigns between the wolf and the lamb and both the religious and the "philosophick" contents of the Scrip- tures are in every way consonant with modern science. Thus the conflict is not between religion and science, but between the "mosaicall &amp; essentiall" versus a spurious Greek philosophy. "The excellent philosopher Hermes" obviously knew his Moses and the mysteries, and all "ethnick philosophers," in so far as they are not wrong, are mere plagiarists of the mosaic science. Thus Ecclesiastes i. 7 gives us the correct theory on the subject of rivers ;5 and God will call the philosophers to account, for disseminating false doctrines not only with regard to such religious fundamentals as the Creation, but also with regard to the generation of meteors.6 Fludd knew, like More, that "there is a various Intertexture of Theosophical and Philosophical Truths"' and that Scripture gave us the truth "concerning God and the nature of things."8 It was precisely because of the new developments of science and the consequent need for a new integration of outlook, that More considered it "a special act of Providence that this hidden Cabbala came so seasonably to the knowledge of the Gentiles."9 It must be stressed that this specific preoccupation is characteristic of seventeenth-century Christian, or rather English Kabbalah, and is of far lesser prominence in the classical documents of Jewish kabbalism.10 Of the "truth concerning God and the nature of things" it was mainly the former that interested the kabbalists. No doubt Kabbalah contained the seeds that could develop-the right interest given-into a genuine attempt at a natural philosophy, and the Jewish kabbalists never tired of repeating their favourite phrase "that all inferior things are images of the superiors; and such as the inferiors are, such also are the superiors." This dictum obviously found favour 1 Miss Nicolson in The Conway Letters, 1930, p. 454; cf. also her article quoted p. 9go, n. , p. 5 f. 2 Probably drafts of Knorr's Kabbala Denu- data with which the younger van Helmont had acquainted him; cf.

But the seventeenth-century philosophers were serious about it in a way in which the Jewish kabbalists were not. To the latter, kabbalism meant the speculative contemplation of the sephiroth, i.e. of the symbolic manifestation of the mysterious and intensely dramatic dynamism of inner-divine life. Their concern was therefore theosophy and not philo- sophy, let alone natural philosophy. Affirmations concerning the analogies between microcosm and macrocosm, etc., were hardly more than conventional cliches. True, they were meant honestly enough, but they could never com- mand the same fascinated attention and intense, rapt and untiring speculation as the sephirotic life. It is often overlooked in this connexion that the Zoharic doctrine of sephiroth and emanations does not pretend to account for the universe in a Neoplatonic fashion. The sephirotic emanations describe the unfolding of the divine personality as a unitarian though highly differentiated complex or pleroma. This process of unfolding or emanation reaches its final stage in the tenth sephirah "Malkhuth." The relation of this sephirotic (i.e. divine) sphere, viz. that of its lowest component Malkhuth to the "lower worlds" is a moot question concerning which different strata of the Zohar seem to hold different opinions. The universe may be the result of further emanations; it may be a creatio ex nihilo, or both, in so far as everything happening in the nether world is paralleled by and mirrors the hidden movements of the inner, divine life. Theogony and cosmogony are then two different perspectives on the same reality.' But the very fact that the problem is one for further investi- gation by Zohar specialists is proof abundant that every facile generalization about the universe being an emanation from the divine essence on the Neo- platonic pattern is sheer nonsense. The point where Kabbalah and the mani- festations of natural causality met in Judaism was most frequently magic. But this is already the very periphery of Kabbalah where it fades into folklore and superstition. For the seventeenth-century English kabbalist, however, Kab- balah meant a spiritual philosophy of nature. As such it was, of course, closely connected with Alchemy and thereby also with magic.2 A good illustration of the above is the kabbalistic treatment of the first chapter of Genesis. The author of the Zohar would certainly not deny that the chapter also describes in some mystical way the creation of our temporal and material universe; but, in point of fact, this aspect of the subject simply did not interest him. Instead, he interprets it as a mystical allegory of the emanation of the sephiroth out of the abyss of "nothingness" of divine existence, the Ungrund of the deus absconditus.3 The seventeenth-century Platonist, on the other hand, might borrow that interpretation and refer it to the Trinity by equating the "Beginning" with the Son, Wisdom, Word or Reason of God.4 But all this Theogony is accepted because of its immediate relevance to cosmogony and to the philosophy of nature. Whereas to the Jewish kabbalist all Kabbalah tended to become maassey merkabah "works of the chariot" (i.e. the mystery of 1 Cf.

ZWI WERBLOWSKY sephirotic life), to the Platonist it meant maassey beredithl ("works of the begin- ning," i.e. cosmogony).1 In conclusion to this part, attention should be drawn to the fact that Jewish mysticism has not only a long history of evolution and change, but actually a record of revolutionary and new departures. The various periods of kabbalism are thus separated by veritable caesuras. Such a caesura is the thirteenth-century kabbalism which evolved in Provence and Spain and culminated in the Zohar. Another major caesura was the activity of Isaac Luria (1534-1572)2 who practically revolutionized kabbalism by enriching it with a number of amazing and original neo-gnostic myths. No doubt Luria believed that he interpreted the authentic meaning of the Zohar and other earlier kabbalistic documents, in the same way as the author of the Zohar probably believed that he correctly interpreted earlier texts or as the Early Fathers believed that they correctly interpreted the Scriptures. But there is no trace of the specific Lurianic doctrines in the Zohar, as little as the charac- teristic Zoharic ideas are in the Talmud. This did not prevent Lurianism from conquering Judaism within a very short time, and henceforward all Kabbalah was read with Lurianic eyes. This holds true both ofJewish mystics for whom the Lurianic exposition was the only orthodox one and almost invested with divine authority, as well as for non-Jewish kabbalists, since all their knowledge was (and still mainly is) derived from Knorr who had imbibed Lurianism from his Jewish teachers. Thus one only has to compare Reuchlin or Riccius, where we seek in vain for anything but the pure milk of older Spanish kabbalism, with Knorr and those who came in his wake, in order to see the difference. Henry More apparently heard of Luria only at a later stage of his studies when he began to inquire of a learned Jew about him. Writing to Lady Conway3 he reports that "... as for that Isaac Luria whose commentary in MSS. Peganius4 sayes he has to helpe him to understand the Zoar, the Jew told me that they hold that Isaac Luria to be the most knowing man of their cabbala of the Jewes nation." II The influence of Kabbalism on the intellectual climate of the seventeenth century is beyond any doubt.5 "Cabbalism as a form of thought permeates much seventeenth-century literature; it is as impossible to separate it sharply from other ideas of a particular author as it is to define exactly the particular brand of Platonism he held. By the seventeenth century, cabbalism had be- 1 The traditional distinction of these two branches of esoteric teaching was current also among Christian kabbalists since Pico. Henry More, e.g., admits in a scholion ("An Appen- dix to the Defence etc." in A Collection of Several Philosophical Writings of Dr. Henry More, 7I12, p. 121) that the Pythagorean Denarius "non ad Bereshith tantum, sed ad Mercavae Mysteria pertinere intelligitur," though, for the rest, he too correlates kabbalistic ter- minology with natural philosophy. 2 Cf.

When applied to Milton, this means that he too, like other seventeenth- century authors, accepted important doctrines from kabbalism as he did from Neoplatonism, though one still may doubt whether the particular passages on which Professor Saurat rests his case justify the sweeping breadth of his assertions. "The important influence of the cabbala is seldom found in the actual verbal analogies," though many such analogies can be found in seventeenth-century writers.2 M. Saurat's thesis is well known. He considers Neoplatonism to be too easy an answer to the question of Milton's sources, whereas the kabbalistic hypothesis incidentally also accounts for the surprising similarities between Blake and Milton who "were both kabbalists and . .. this fact explains their common stock of ideas."3 He concludes that Milton had used the Zohar, as there is no other plausible hypothesis covering the range of correspondences.4 There is thus, in addition to the individual correspondences, the cumulative weight of the whole system. None the less, Professor Saurat admits that only the doctrine of tsimtsum or retraction is purely kabbalistic5 and it is on it that he mainly rests his case. So far every single item in this "range of correspon- dences" has been queried. That Milton knew the kabbalistic tsimtsum is admitted by some authors," whereas others dispute it not on kabbalistic grounds but because the lines in Paradise Lost bear out another meaning.7 Considering the fusion of kabbalistic and other strands of thought in the general welter of Neoplatonic speculation, it may seem impossible to dis- entangle the various elements; yet, the attempt may prove worthwhile. The analysis is further complicated by the fact that whenever ideas fill the intel- lectual atmosphere of an age and are freely copied by one author from an- other, it becomes extremely hazardous to lay down "sources" with any precision. It would be foolish to discuss the influence of Augustine or Thomas Aquinas on a Catholic author who, for aught we know, may only have read his catechism and an average theological manual. Why, for example, assume first-hand acquaintance with the Zohar at a time when everybody copied Pico, Reuchlin, Galatin and Riccius in a way which to-day would result in charges of plagiarism and infringement of copyright? Recent research into the general accessibility and conventional nature of hexaemeral and similar material has made it clear that "Milton scholarship has been needlessly confused with source studies which virtually cancel each other .... Milton and the other writers in the genre got their material where they could get it most conveniently. This was not the ultimate sources."s This is as true of kabbalistic as of 1 M. H.

Our suspicion as to direct influence on Milton of Zoharic passages must be heightened by the fact that most of Saurat's evidence comes from de Pauly's translation of the Zohar, a work which is one of the most astounding combinations of sheer ignorance and brazen forgery.' What then is the range of correspondences proving Milton to have been a kabbalist? There is: (I) the doctrine of creation through retraction;2 (2) creation through the agency of a demiurge: the Son.3 Both doctrines suppose the existence of a ubiquitous and transcendent God or En Soph.4 (3) The notion of sexual life in God in connexion with the r61le of Wisdom ; (4) the pantheistic notion of matter as divine substance and, consequently, (5) the vanishing of the difference between Soul and Body, i.e. Materialism; (6) the idea that there is Evil in God; the description (7) of Chaos as nature's womb and grave,6 (8) and of the details of Eve's temptation of Adam;7 (9) the incident of Satan's incest with Sin which is patterned on the divine incest; 8 (i o) insistence on Free Will ; (i ) Milton's positive appreciation of the body and its sexual functions and (12) connected with the latter, his views on the relations between man and woman. Other minor points are10 the ideas that (a) original sin takes place in each of us and not once and for all in Adam, (b) in God's intention our bodies were to become spirits without having to undergo death, (c) there is much in the Fall that is good, (d) there exist mysteries which it is fatal to unveil, (e) God reveals himself to men according to their powers and not such as He is, (f) Holy Scripture has many meanings, (g) external events, though real in themselves, are yet mainly symbols for spiritual events. Concerning the latter points little need be said, as some of them are not in the Zohar and others are old Christian commonplaces, though the Kabbalah may have contributed in a general way to their new formulation and spread. Thus (a) is not Zoharic doctrine, though the individual "interiorization" of the Fall and other myths is typical of many mystical systems; (b) is known in non-kabbalistical Christian tradition;1" (c) is not Zoharic teaching but part of the Felix Culpa tradition which obviously recommended itself to the Renais- sance-mind which would hardly admit that "knowledge" could be evil. More's admission that there was "some use" in the Fall,12 is of this Renaissance nine editions between 1516 and I612. Riccius was published I510, 1515 and 1541 before being reprinted in Pistorius. Kircher's chapters on Cabala Hebraeorum (in his Oedipus Aegyptiacus, tom. ii, pars i, Rome, 1653) are mainly a concoction from Reuchlin and Galatinus; cf. Scholem, Bibl. Kabb. no 662. 1 In fact, most of the Zoharic passages quoted by Saurat from de Pauly either do not exist altogether or are gross mistranslations. One marvels less at M. Saurat who could do no better than rely on de Pauly, than at "Dr Lieber of the Hautes Etudes" who has "veri- fied in the original" the quotations used by M. Saurat. (Saurat, op. cit., p. 207, n. i.)

It is symptomatic in this respect that Henry More called his exposition of Genesis "the threefold Cabbala." (g) is a tradition going back to Philo of Alexandria. To what extent it is legitimate to speak of a kabbalistic pantheism or doctrine of matter as divine substance has already been hinted at and will be developed further when we come to discuss the tsimtsum. But pantheistic tendencies are even more characteristic of other traditions than of kabbalism. Chaos as Nature's grave has nothing whatsoever to do with the Zoharic myth of the "kings that died" (Gen. xxxvi. 31) which is, in its turn, based on a Midrashic legend concerning God "building worlds and destroying them"2 before establishing the present universe. The original Midrash is far more relevant to Milton's idea than is its mystical metamorphosis in the Zohar.3 As for Eve's considerations in tempting Adam, the passage Paradise Lost, ix, 826-33 really bears some resemblance to the Zohar4 but the motif derives neither from the Zohar nor from Eleazar of Worms nor from the Kabbalah altogether. It is an older Midrash which got into Tosippon. That Yosippon is a possible or even probable source of Milton has been shown by Fletcher.5 Free Will, to M. Saurat evidence of Zoharic influence, shows, according to Taylor,6 dependence on Du Bartas. It is undoubtedly true that kabbalism contains the germs of a positive attitude to the world, the body and the senses. Yet, one feels that the kab- balists7 are as often as not merely paying lip-service to this affirmation to which they are committed partly by their pantheistic tendencies, partly by their conviction that everything below mirrors and symbolizes a higher, divine reality. Almost all historical manifestations of Neoplatonism are caught between the horns of this same dilemma: their ontological monism (the world as a chain of emanations and thence divine) and their axiological dualism which equates the radical contrast between good and evil with that between Spirit and Matter or Soul and Body. In kabbalistic literature this dilemma is very much softened but not completely solved, and Lurianic kabbalism, for example, is definitely ascetic. One could, perhaps, say that a view which regarded matter, the flesh and nature as essentially good, could be stimulated 1 See Lovejoy, "Milton and the Paradox of the Fortunate Fall," Essays in the History of Ideas, 1948. 2 Similar, though not exactly identical views were also held by Clement of Alexan- dria and by Origen (de Princip. iii. 5- 3). 3 Cf.

J. ZWI WERBLOWSKY or encouraged by the Kabbalah.1 Yet we find the apostle of Christian Kabbalah, the great Reuchlin, unequivocally stating a different opinion: "Thus we consider as lurid and sordid and low with dirtiness those things which are said to be in the lower world, and we admire as pure and notable and adorned with unbelievable beauty and we praise highly those things which are said to be in the upper world."2 It is similarly true that the insistence on the incompleteness of man without woman is notable in the Zohar, though not in the Zohar only. The appreciation of human love as a spiritual phenomenon taking its positive place in the hierarchy of loves and culminating in the divine, is a Neoplatonic Renaissance commonplace, as witness the instantaneous success ofJudah Abrabanel's alias Leone Ebreo's Dialoghi d'Amore (1535). The incompleteness of man without woman is basically an Old Testament doctrine which was further developed by the Rabbis3 and was finally invested with a highly mystical meaning by the kabbalists.4 Sexual union became symbolic of the hieros gamos of the male and female principles or sephiroth in the divine personality, and thus there arose a metaphysics of the sexual act. However, this doctrine has nothing whatsoever to do with the extravagant glorification of woman occasionally to be found in Christian Kabbalah, for example, in the writings of Agrippa of Nettesheim where it is proved by means of alphabetical techniques that the correspondence of the name Eve to the Tetragrammaton is much closer than that of the name Adam.5 On the other hand, there is a very marked anti- feminine tendency in Jewish kabbalism.6 Generally speaking, the sexual mysticism of the Kabbalah is unlike Christian mysticism in that the mystic does not strive after union with the divine, but after a concentration of intention on God. The effort to contem- plate and/or help bringing about the unification of opposites in God, entails for the mystic a systematic imitatio dei. Such an imitation is the "marriage" to one's other half, representing the maximum realization of the Self which is, 1 Cf. M. H. Nicolson, "Milton and Hobbes," Studies in Philology, XXIII, I926, pp. 412-3: "In his interest in cabbalistic ethics-an interest common to practically all the I7th-century idealists-he [Milton] is again one with the opponents of Hobbes ... so that to Milton, as to the English platonists, the natural was good: Nature, matter, instincts, are of God and hence cannot be evil"; and id. "The Spirit World of Milton and More," Studies in Philology, XXII, 1925, p. 437: "Neither More nor Milton felt that body hindered spirit.... Both were men to whom 'temperance' in the true sense was a cardinal principle, yet neither was in any degree an ascetic. More declares himself a 'lover of the body,' provided the body be kept worthy of love." 2 De Arte Cabbalistica, Basle, I517, f. ii b. Cf. also gohar i. i6a, ii. 22oa, iii. I7oa. As a matter of fact, the varying evaluations of the body tended to formulate themselves in connexion with the doctrine of the resurrec- tion of the body. Thus Cudworth reaffirms the traditional golden mean by claiming as man's ultimate destiny a "spiritual and heavenly body." He emphatically rejects the more extreme formulations of Plotinus or the view that man's destined state is quite body- less "as some high-flown persons have con- ceited. Christianity is in agreement on this point with the 'Pythagoric cabala.' " (Op. cit., iv. p. I f., 11. f.) 3 Cf. Babylonian Talmud, rebamoth 62b-63a; Gen. Rabbah xxii; Talkut Shim'oni, Gen. 23. 4 Cf.

Fludd, faithful to the principle that such as the inferiors are, such are the superiors also, explains that Chaos was God's feminine companion in the same way as Eve had come from Adam; "such is the opinion both of heathen philosophers and mystical kabbalists." The primordial Adam had two qualities, masculine and feminine; and woman, viz. the faculty of soul for which she stands, though she "seem inferior, yet is far from contemptible"3 provided she is kept in her proper place.4 All we can therefore say is that the more positive evaluation of woman may have been reinforced by kabbalistic influence, but only because there already was a disposition in that sense. Yet it is important to bear in mind the peculiar emphasis of the male-female symbolism in the Jewish Kabbala h, because it also explains the genesis of the incest symbolism. Once we admit the symbol of a divine hieros gamos, we either have to posit two primeval principles which can unite, or else the union will have to be incestuous. In fact, most ancient myths begin with a Great Mother figure, and consequently the mythological incest is of the Mother-Son type. For the patriarchal world of the old Israelites as also for later Jewish mythology and the Kabbalah, this is obviously impossible. This is not the place to discuss the psychological significance of these facts, but the analogy between the sephiroth-symbolism and the creation-myth of Genesis in striking. Adam's wife, Eve, is, in a way, also his daughter; "woman because she was taken out of man"5 and similarly the feminine sephiroth are emanations from the higher, male ones.6 There is no doubt but this kabbalistic imagery has stimulated Christian speculation, but this does not mean that there is any real analogy between the two. On the contrary, the conflation of the sephiroth with Trinitarian, Sapience and Logos symbols, rendered a true understanding of the Zohar impossible. En Soph, not so much the primary cause or Urgrund of things, but rather, to use Jacob Boehme's word, their Ungrund,7 emanates the sephiroth. This may seem little more than the hackneyed attempt to reconcile the ideas of trans- cendence and immanence of God, and thus it was also understood by many Christian kabbalists.8 But to the Zohar it means the unfolding of the hidden life of God and also the process whereby man is enabled to perceive it; it alone renders contact with the deus absconditus possible as the sephiroth-system is the object of the contemplation of the divine.9 The emanation is an inner- divine process by which the god-personality develops into a more differentiated 1 Cf. MTJM, p. 123. In the last resort this sexual mysticism is the objectified animus- anima integration. Not unio mystica with God is desired but a personal and archetypal uni- fication conceived as analogous with events in God. Prof. Saurat rightly says (p. 241) that because life below is an image of life within God, therefore man has need of woman. Psychologically this means that the kabbalistic sephiroth-symbolism is nothing but a projection of the Self. 2 Op. cit., p. 8. 3 Ibid., p. 40. 4 Cf.

Here, it is true, is an opening for cosmology; but the Kabbalah has never really exploited it.1 The first sephirah "Kether" still belongs, to all intents and purposes, to the sphere of the En-Soph absconditus; one cannot even say that it is.2 Only the next emanation, the second sephirah called Hokhmah or "wisdom of God" can bear positive predicates of existence. It is called "Father," and the next emanation Binah or the "intelligence of God" is called "Mother." Their perpetual union, so strikingly different from the vicissitudes in the relations of the central sephirah " Tif'ereth" with the Shekhinah (another name for the tenth sephirah which is conceived as female), produces and vivifies the seven lower sephiroth. It is obvious that this scheme cannot be squared with the Trinitarian one where the first sephirah, the inaccessible and hidden God, has to be equated with the first person of the Trinity, the Father. But Kether cannot, on kab- balistic premises, have any relations whatsoever, let alone enjoy sexual "recreations," whereas use of sapiential or Logos imagery would plainly imply such relationships between Kether (the Father of the Trinity) and Hokhmah (the Father in the Zohar but the Son or Logos of the Trinity). The latter relation- ship is perfectly legitimate as kabbalistic Christian mythology and is, in fact, based, in addition to the celebrated passage Proverbs viii. 22 ff., on John i. I8: "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him." Kabbalism may have stimulated renewed imaginative interest in these symbols, but they were already well- established in the Renaissance tradition, as witness that "better teacher than Aquinas," Spenser, in the Hymne of Heavenly Love, 11. 134-5 and, more par- ticularly, his Hymne of Heavenly Beauty, 11. 183 f.: There in his bosome Sapience doth sit The sovreaine dearling of the Deity Clad like a Queene in royall robes, most fit For so great powre and peerlesse maiesty. Whereas in the former passage it is Christ who reigns "in the bosome of eternall blisse" together with the Father, the second passage describes Wisdom in feminine language throughout. All this has obviously little to do with the Zohar where the second sephirah is the "Father."3 Most writings on this subject are therefore Kabbalah-inspired but not kabbalistic in the strict sense. More- over it should be realized that much "kabbalistic" speculation on the Trinity is in reality nourished not by the Kabbalah proper but by Platonism.4 It is surely significant that for Cudworth, for example, the "Jewish Cabalah" on the subject is represented by - Philo. The others who, unlike Cudworth, make use of Zoharic terms, are hopelessly confused, and none more so than Fludd. There is no reason to doubt that Milton knew this kind of literature, but 1 Ibid., p. 209. 2 Ibid., p. 25; cf. also the quotations from Reuchlin and Fludd infra p. I Io f. 3This traditional mistake of Christian Kabbalah is also repeated by Thomas Vaughan, Lumen de Lumine. The editor, A. E. Waite, rightly points out the confusion; cf.

The introduction of Urania is obviously inconclusive. As Kelley has pointed out,1 the Treatise makes no mention of sexual recreations, not even in its exegesis of Prov. viii. 22-3;2 the Tetrachordon passage3 which Saurat considers so "daring"4 actually refers to the relation of the Church and Christ and, moreover, does not warrant the attribution of a forced erotic meaning to the verb "play."5 The Treatise clearly states that not the Son but a poetical personification of Wisdom is meant,6 though the two cannot always strictly be separated. As has been said before, in order to correspond to the Trinitarian scheme, the sephirah "Kether" ought to enjoy these divine recreations; as it is, Hokhmah does, and this Hokhmah, the "Wisdom" and "Father" of the Zohar, is called the "sister" of Urania in Paradise Lost vii. 10. Saurat's references to de Pauly7 reveal hopelessly faulty translations. The analogy of the divine incest (of which, as we have shown, no trace exists in Milton) with that of Satan is more apparent than real. There is not the slightest hint of such incest anywhere in the Zohar, although the latter abounds in references to the sexual relations of the two male and female chief principles of evil. But again we cannot exclude the possibility that it was the sexual imagery in kabbalistic literature which may have put Milton on the way to his paraphrase of James i. 15. Our previous discussion of the interrelations of the higher sephiroth brings us to the problem of Creation and En Soph. Leaving aside the aforementioned consideration that the whole sephirotic world is that of the divine pleroma and that, for the Zohar, the question of the created world would arise mainly in relation to the tenth sephirah, it is fairly clear that the very idea of a Mediator or Son or intervening sephirah comes close to that of a Demiurge. If it were not, there would never have been a gnostic crisis in the Church. In so far as the Son is by definition the mediating function between the hidden Father and the World, there is no reason why this mediation should be restricted to the redemptive act only and should not be extended also to His creative activity. This theological commonplace was also firmly entrenched in poetry as witness again Spenser's Hymne of Heavenly Love 11. 127 f. and, particularly, 11. I9o f.: Him first to love, great right and reason is Who first to us our life and being gave; And after when we fared had amisse Us wretches from the second death did save; And last the food of life, which now we have Even himselfe in his deare sacrament To feede our hungry soules unto us lent. En Soph, being hidden, unrevealed, inaccessible, is the mystical "Nothing" or ayin out of whose fullness proceeds that which, humanly speaking, bridges the gulf to existence and the nether worlds, and to which therefore the term "being" can first be applied. We shall reserve the relevant quotations for the 1 Op. cit., p. 128 f. 2 Columbia ed. xv. 13. 7-9. 3 Ibid., iv. 86.

J. ZWI WERBLOWSKY discussion of the tsimtsum. But not only En Soph, also the first sephirah "Kether" (identified in parts of the Zohar with En Sophl) is called "nothingness" because, in the words of Reuchlin,2 nos tam tenui erga res divinas ingenii paupertate mulctati, de iis quae non apparent haud secus atque de iis quae non sunt, judicamus. To the extent that this kabbalistic speculation becomes, with Christian writers, kabbalistic allegory for "natural philosophy," these stages of the process of emanation become stages of cosmogony. Thus for Fludd, "nothing" means the Dark Abysse, chaos, shadow of death, i.e. formless potentiality in God. Though to God "darknesse is unto him as light," yet unto us it is a nihil,3 and "according to the Cabbalisticall Doctors opinion, the eternall Sapience, which is the radicall beginning or unity of all things . .. was in regard of our weak capacities esteemed Ain, that is to say nihil or nothing . . . and yet out of this nihil was revealed unto us infinity."4 The cosmological application is that "forasmuch as nothing is in God, but what is essential reality, or a something in being but of him, by him and in him are all things (Rom. xi. I2) wherefore as well as the dark matrix or womb of the waters, as the watry infant or humid nature which sprung out of the belly of the gloomy abysse or Chaos; were really in God before they appeared to sight . . . waters were the maternall principle being created or inacted by the spirit of the Lord or Elohim Ruach."5 Now this spiritus agens was, for Fludd as for other Christian kabbalists, none other than Christ. For "coming to the purpose," Fludd explains that the "Apostle, speaking of the eternall Christ, saith ... Christ is the vertue of God, and the wisdom of God (I Cor. i. 24) ... the spirituall Christ, who is the wisdom, vertue and word of God . . . how by his apparition out of darkness, that is by the mutation or change of the first principle . . . from the dark Aleph to light Aleph6 the waters which were contained in the profound bowells of the abysse were revealed."' To establish the creation by Christ, Fludds presses literally the verse (i Cor. viii. 6) "one God, the Father of whom are all things (e, a6 7r adv-), and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things" (8t o auC ,&amp;V:). Both the idea and the proof-text are commonplaces. Henry More9 says the same and refers to Ambrose, Basil and Origen. He could also have referred to Jerome and others. Milton defines creation as "that act whereby God the Father produced every thing that exists by his Word and Spirit, that is by his will, For the manifestation of the glory of his power and good- ness."'1 This definition accounts for most of the passage Paradise Lost vii. 168 f., as the phrase "by his word" means "as is evident from other [scriptural] passages, by the Son who appears hence to derive his title of Word."'"1 In view of the many New Testament passages expressly associating Christ and the Word with Creation, there is nothing startling in the assertion of 1 The exact nature of the relationship be- tween the two is a matter for special investi- gation, as it seems to be differently conceived in different strata of the Zohar. 2 De Arte Cabbalistica, f. lxii a-b. 3 Fludd, op. cit., pp. 44-7- 4 Ibid., p. 48.

On the contrary, the difficulty is how to explain these New Testament passages away, since opera trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa. In fact, the orthodox doctrine, both catholic and reformed, is that neither the Father nor the Son but the Triune Godhead created.2 Christ's share in the Creation is therefore a theological commonplace; its overemphasis is probably heretical but it is marked in the seventeenth century and possibly strengthened by its conflation with kab- balistic symbolism. Thus Fludd enlarges3 on the identity of Christ with "the Cabalist's great Angell," Mitatron, "the catholick intellectuall Agent, from the which all peculier forms do descend . .. this was that catholick, angelicall Spirit which God sent out as a Spirituall Messenger from himself, and out of himself, in the form of an emanation... and the emanation was this Word of God by whom all things were made, and vivified, forasmuch as in it was life: I mean that Christ which filleth all things, who is all in all as the Apostle saith." In other words, Christ is the anima mundi.4 The heretical possibilities of this notion and of the Neoplatonic Kabbalah in general are obvious. Henry More had every reason to feel disturbed by the way in which George Keith linked kabbalistic doctrines with the idea of "the soul of Christ every way out of his body through the whole Creation." This semi-pantheistic Christ (as well as the "Christ in us") is, according to More, "a hopelesse and groundlesse conceit" and endangers faith in "Christ without us."5 These notions are not peculiar to Fludd alone and there is thus no reason to connect Milton's account of creation through the Son either with Fludd or directly with the Kabbalah. I have tended, in the foregoing, to concentrate rather on Fludd because M. Saurat devotes much space to a discussion of his system and to its influence on Milton.6 Saurat rates Fludd's kabbalistic knowledge high, although he admits his astounding ignorance in matters of detail, the best-known example of which is his mistaking Zoar for the name of a Rabbi.' Fludd is supposed to know the doctrine of the unknowable God, sexual cosmogony and, above all, the tsimtsum. connexion it is interesting to note that Thomas Vaughan, in expatiating on the Son as the mediating principle, makes the words "from which etc." refer to the Son, whereas "by which etc." is taken to refer to the Holy Ghost (Anthroposophia Theomagica, Works ed. Waite, p. 28). In Lumen de Lumine (ibid., p. 297) he states: "that all things are con- ceived ideally or-as we commonly express it-created by the Second Person is confirmed by the word of God" and quotes John i. I o-I I. 1 De nat. et gratia 34, 39. 2 Cf. St. Thomas, Summa Theol. i. I4, 6: "creare communi est toti Trinitati"; and H.

Cudworth, after discussing the pantheists of antiquity, severely takes to task "some fanatics of latter time (n. Rob.

Equally wrong, though less gross, were "the more sublimated pagans" who assumed a divine anima mundi (ibid., iii. 5 ff.). It is curious to note that Mitatron is identified in I3th-century Kab- balah with the ioth sephirah "Shekhinah," as this latter term is applied by Cudworth to Christ, "the pure soul and body of the Messiah ... a living temple ... of the Deity"; cf. also id.

ZWI WERBLOWSKY What exactly is the tsimtsum? It is a kabbalistic myth developed by Isaac Luria (I534-72). Since Luria left no writings, his teaching has to be sought in the writings of his disciples and followers which circulated widely in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The canonical version of Luria's teach- ing is considered to be that contained in the writings of his official "heir" R. Chayim Vital Calabrese (1543-1620). But as the latter's writings were published only late, Lurianic kabbalism made its first impact through the writings of the other disciples.' According to all the versions, the doctrine of the tsimtsum is a highly mystical one, though its initial starting-point is a gross and naive naturalism.2 With God's infinity being all and filling all, there was no space for creation. God therefore withdrew "Himself from Him- self," not concentrating at a point but retreating away from His centre to His circumference, as it were. He now no longer fills all, but leaves, in the middle of Himself, a vacuum in which creation can take place. It should be noted that God does not contract or concentrate, but rather retires sideways to the periphery.3 This retraction or tsimtsum is a dynamic act, the first step in the work of creation. This is the simplest formulation of the Lurianic doctrine which I shall now illustrate by three quotations. The first is taken from the "canonical" writings of Vital, the second from a typical and representative average work of post-Lurianic Kabbalah, and the third from Knorr's Kabbala Denudata. (i) "Know that before the Emanator emanated these emanations which are now emanated, created, formed and made4. . .. the En Soph filled all space . . . and since the En Soph filled the space of the worlds which he created later, there was thus no vacuum. It was therefore necessary that the En Soph contract His existence and His light, and leave a vacant space into which to emanate the worlds. However, this tsimtsum-movement did not take place at any of His sides but exclusively in the middle, in His very centre, and He contracted Himself sideways equally to all sides ... so that a vacuum remained in the middle."5 Another passage in Vital is even more explicit, though the formulation of the crucial point is rather unfortunate: "Know that before the emanations were emanated and the created things were created, the highest and equal light equally filled the whole of reality so that there was no vacant space in the nature of vacant air or vacuum. All was filled equally by this light of En Soph and there was nothing in the nature of beginning and end but all was one Light, absolutely equal in all respects, and this was called the light of En Soph. And when He conceived the desire to create the worlds and to emanate the emanations in order to reveal the fullness of his actions and names and attributes-which is the reason for the creation of the worlds-. ... then En Soph contracted him- 1 Cf.

And after this retraction, when an empty space and a vacuous air had been established in the middle of the light, then the space existed in which all beings emanated, created, formed and made, could exist. Then He produced from the light of En Soph one straight line . . . which descends into this vacuum . . . and in the space of this vacuum he emanated, created, formed and made all the worlds."2 (2) "Before the worlds were created and before He emanated the emanations, He was in the place of all the worlds that were to be created later, and they were all filled with the light of En Soph-be He blessed- and there was no vacuous place or part or point in which there was not the light of En Soph, so that it was impossible to create anything in it .... Wherefore He had, as it were, to withdraw Himself from Himself, and right into the midst of Himself make room, as it were, in His own being S. .. in which to create through His emanations the worlds of emanation, creation, formation and action ... so that an empty space was left in His Self, as it were. Not, however, absolutely empty, because where Holiness dwells, an impress of the light of Holiness always remains ... and it was this impress of the light of Holiness which made this vacuum subsist; this is the light of the reshimu."3 (3) "Contractio. Cum Deus infinitus vellet emittere quae emanere debebant, contraxit seipsum in medio lucis suae centrali; ita, ut intensis- sima illa lux ad circumferentiam quandam atque ad latera in se recederet. . .. .Et haec est contractio prima. . . . Omnis autem Zimzum seu con- tractio habet naturam din judicii rigorosi."4 In his Theses Cabbalisticae,5 Knorr sums up the stages of this process: i. Deus creaturus mundos Contraxit praesentiam suam ii. Unde spatium quod dicitur AMr primus iii. In hoc remanserunt Vestigia Lucis divinae iv. Quae etiam dicuntur Aura prima etc. The last two quotations introduce us to the Lurianic doctrine of the reshimu, the traces of light remaining in the now vacuous space after En Soph had withdrawn His presence, i.e. His light-essence. This doctrine plays a large part in Professor Saurat's system, although there is nothing in either Milton or in his quotations from de Pauly to warrant its introduction. M. Saurat's mystical intuition is all the more striking as, in spite of the obvious inadequacy of the sources which he adduces, he occasionally really hits on kabbalistical ideas. Milton, he claims, went to the Zohar6 where he learned 1 Here the wording is so clumsy and mis- leading as to explain how the error of con- centration at one point could have arisen. It is, however, beyond peradventure, that the meaning is: "a retraction-movement set in at the centre," moving outwards. 2 Vital, Ets Hayim, Korzec, 1784, f. 5a. SShefa' Tal, Hanau, 1612, f. 47b f.

ZWI WERBLOWSKY that "according to His eternal plans, God withdraws His will from certain parts of Himself and delivers them up, so to speak, to obscure latent impulsions that remain in them. Through this 'retraction' matter ... [and] individual beings are created .... Had therefore God not withdrawn from beings, there would have been in the universe nothing but God."' "There existed in the Infinite a sort of latent life which God had liberated, given over to its own forces and which developed and expressed itself" both for good and evil. "God has intensified His own existence, raising to glory the good parts of Himself, casting outside of Himself the evil parts of Himself too, because "Evil into the mind of God or man, may come and go" (Paradise Lost vii. I117-8). Terrible words, applied to God. .... Milton's idea of God's aims: to drive away the evil latent in the Infinite, to exalt the good latent also .... The Kabbalists give dark hints of an evil side to their unfathomable God. ... ."2 "Evil exists as a possibility in God Himself. This allows us to understand that when God 'retires', abandons certain parts of Himself to their latent impulses, evil is expressed owing to free will."3 Now of all this there is no trace in Milton or in the Zohar. Moreover, the tsimtsum means anything but the liberation of obscure latent impulses in the cosmos. The above quotations should have made that clear. But the idea that God rids himself of his potential evil is partly explicit, partly implicit in Lurianic kabbalism. Elsewhere Saurat comes closer still to the kabbalistic doctrine: "Blake places the Fall at the very origin of things. ... We have here a reason given us of creation which is perhaps not so un-Miltonic as it appears.4 God has created the world to cast off an evil part of Himself. Milton has at least the elements of this conception."5 Obviously Milton has no such elements, and the passage in question is neither "daring" nor "terrible," as God here most probably means angel." But what M. Saurat has projected on Milton is, in fact, the esoteric content of Luria's doctrine of tsimtsum, evil and the kelippoth, as has been conclusively shown by Tishby's careful analysis.7 The Lurianic myth of God is a cathartic myth. Interesting as all this may be, it is clearly of no relevance for an objective understanding of either Milton or seventeenth-century Christian kabbalism. The doctrine of retraction, once launched by Luria's disciples, soon led to a significant division of opinion. There were those who insisted on taking the myth literally, whereas others, disturbed by its anthropomorphic features, tried to give it a more abstract, allegorized explanation. This new array of forces coincided with the pantheistic, viz. more theistic, factions among kab- balists. Obviously those who took the tsimtsum in a literal sense,8 could main- tain the transcendence of God with respect to His creation more consistently than those who held that God could not really have withdrawn His essence from any part of space, and that the tsimtsum must, therefore, be interpreted 1 Op. cit., pp. 102-3. 2 Ibid., p. I 1o. 3 Ibid., p. 124. 4 This, however, does not square with the aims of creation as set forth in Milton, pp. 109- I0. 5 Blake and Milton, 1935, pp. I41-3. 6 Cf. T. H.

Emanuel Hai Rikki.</page><page sequence="20">MILTON AND THE CONJECTURA CABBALISTICA log in a more abstract way.' It is thus clearly a mistake to say that the doctrine of tsimtsum leads to pantheism. Quite on the contrary, it is a mystical doctrine with a definitely theistic, transcendental and anti-pantheistic tendency and as such contrasts strongly with the Zohar. The pantheistic note can only be introduced by mitigating the literal meaning of the doctrine with the notion of the reshimu. Lurianic kabbalism is far less pantheistic than the Zohar itself, which clearly does not yet know of the tsimtsum. In saying this, I am, of course, aware of the tendency of kabbalists (as, in fact, of all orthodox theologians) to find their own tenets in earlier, authoritative texts. It is therefore not surprising that many of them believed later doctrinal develop- ments to be adumbrated or at least implicitly contained in the Zohar. Thus the great Hassidic leader and mystic R. Shneur Zalman of Ladi (I747-1812) found a reference to the tsimtsum in a Zoharic phrase. Moses Cordovero (1523-70) 2 quotes an utterance by Joseph Caro (1488- 1575) which is discussed at length by the author of Shefa' Tal,3 purporting to hint at the tsimtsum, with which, of course, it has nothing to do. As a rule, however, even orthodox kabbalists agreed that the mysteries revealed by Luria were unknown to former generations of kabbalists, including Cordovero.4 It was thus definitely wrong of Winter-Wiinsche,5 followed by E. Bischoff,6 to state that "Moses Kordovero hat die Lehre von der Selbstbeschrainkung Gottes zu Gunsten der Welt, ausgebildet." Frank7 even claims that the tsimtsum is found in the Zohar (Zohar i. 2a). All these views no longer require serious consideration.8 The tsimtsum is a thoroughly Lurianic doctrine,9 which, of course, does not by itself preclude Milton's knowledge of it. In the seventeenth century Lurianic teaching penetrated Christian kabbalism 0 which it finally dominated through Knorr. But what about the gohar passage quoted by Saurat, of which Paradise Lost vii. 168 f. is alleged to be a paraphrase? Here again the answer is simple. The passage quoted from de Pauly" cannot have been Milton's source. For no matter whether Milton did or did not know the gohar, he certainly could not have known de Pauly, and the passage is de Pauly and not Zohar. Nothing remotely like it occurs in the Tikkune Zohar xix or anywhere else.12 The passage is one of de Pauly's many forgeries, and one need not even be much of a kabbalistic scholar to recognize it as such at a mere glance. Quite apart from the general impossibility of attributing such ideas to the Tikkune 2ohar, the quotation gives itself away by obvious terminological misfits. Thus the 1 The spokesman of this trend was R. Joseph Ergas; cf. MTJM, p. 262. 2 Pardess Rimonim, Sseder haAtsiluth iii. 3 See p. Io7, n. 3- 4 Cf.

The obvious conclusion is that de Pauly knew what to think of the kabbalistic scholarship of his contemporaries and what he could permit himself with impunity.</page><page sequence="21">1IO R. J. ZWI WERBLOWSKY use of the phrase "the Holy one, blessed be He" for God, is quite unthinkable in this context in any authentic kabbalistic document. In the Zohar this name is correlated to the central sephirah "Tif'ereth," whereas the God who retracts himself is always described as En Soph, or "Creator" (borj), or "First Emana- tor" (ma'atsil rishon). If one is really interested in launching theories about influences and sources, one might consider making out a case for the influence of Milton on de Pauly. III Exploding the fallacy of the Zoharic Milton is, of course, the easier part of our task and one which, for the student of the Kabbalah, is hardly worth the trouble. But the more interesting half is the quest for the real sources, if any, of the ideas contained in Paradise Lost vii. 168 f. However, the answer to this too is simple. Milton is influenced not by the Lurianic tsimtsum, still less by the Zohar, but by Christian post-Renaissance Kabbalah in its pre-Lurianic phase, and, more particularly, by those aspects of it which interested seven- teenth-century English Platonism. Here "retraction" simply means that before creating, God was inactive, withdrawn into himself, self-contained, whereas in the act of creation he "comes out of his shell" as it were: "putting forth his goodness." Thus Reuchlin (1455-1522), who died before Luria was born, writes :1 Nihil est principium nisi sapientia; cui equidem recte mihi videar respon- dere quod infinitudo ipsa trium summarum cabbalisticae arboris numera- tionum, quas vos tres in divinis personas apellare consuevistis quae est absolutissima essentia, quae cum sit in abysso tenebrarum retracta &amp; im- manens, ociosaque, vel, ut aiunt, ad nihil respiciens idcirco dicitur ayin, id est, Nihil, sive non ens, ac non finis ... quia nos tam tenui erga res divinas ingenii paupertate mulctati, de iis quae non apparent haud secus atque de iis quae non sunt, judicamus. At ubi se ita ostenderit ut sit aliquid &amp; revera subsistat, tum Aleph tenebrosum in Aleph lucidum convertitur. Similarly Reuchlin describes En Soph as infinitudo, quae est summa quaedam res secundum se incomprehen- sibilis &amp; ineffabilis, in remotissimo suae divinitatis retrocessu &amp; in fontani luminis inaccessibili abysso se retrahens &amp; contegens, ut sic nihil intelligatur ex ea procedere, quasi absolutissima Deitas per ocium omnimoda sui in se ipsa clausione immanens nuda sine ueste ac absque ullo circumstantarum amictu, nec sui profusa, nec splendoris sui dilatata bonitate indiscrimi- natim ens &amp; non ens, &amp; omnia quae rationi nostrae videntur inter se contraria &amp; contradictoria. . .. Istud autem omnem nostrum intellectum transcendit, qui nequit contradictoria in suo principio combinare via rationis... 2 1 De Arte Cabb., f. lxii a-b; italics are mine. 2Ibid., xxi a-b. This is a very beautiful account of En Soph as the mystical conjunctio oppositorum; cf. for this passage, Scholem, Reshith hakabbalah (Hebr.), 1948, p. 146.</page><page sequence="22">MILTON AND THE CONJECTURA CABBALISTICA III Already in Reuchlin's earlier work' the spokesman of the Kabbalah, Baruch, explains that the first of the many divine names is the one which shows the essence of God which is separation from things, being shut up within himself ("separationem a rebus &amp; omnimodam in seipso clausionem"). This idea of separation as the essence of God, Baruch claims to have derived from nobilis ille nostra aetate Philosophus who is, of course, none other than Pico.2 Fludd takes up this theme with his customary profuseness, and as Professor Saurat has pointed out the resemblances between Fludd and Milton, it is strange that the significance of this point should have escaped his notice. God is essentially the same, whether "he willeth or nilleth," as Nihil and as Creator, "whether the divine infinity doth shine forth3 from its centre towards its circumference, or centrally contracteth his acting beams within itself, yet it is all one and the same in its self."4 Vacuity, Inanity, Nothingness and Dark- ness thus describe the state when "God did not as yet shine forth unto the world"5 whereas Creation is nothing but the Spirit producing plenitude. "All plenitude is from the divine Act. . . . Forasmuch as the utter absence of the eternall emanation is intolerable to the creature . . . it followeth that unless God had filled all things in this world with his spirit, vacuity .. . would have possessed the world."6 Here it becomes quite clear that retraction is not a dynamic act by which God changes the previous state of self-contained repose in which he was and filled everything, in order to create a vacuum. On the contrary, retraction is described here as the passive state of universal vacuity, due to the fact that the Deus otiosus is shut up within himself. This state is then changed by the dynamic act of creation in which God proceeds to fill all things. This is the exact reverse of the Lurianic tsimtsum. For Fludd the two principles of passivity and activity, rest and shining forth, vacuity and emanation actually determine the cosmic rhythm which expresses itself as contraction and dilation, heat and cold, life and death, flood and ebb, etc. This notion of a cosmic rhythm or universal systole and diastole seems to be archetypal, as it is found all over the world, for example, in the form of the belief that death does not occur during flood-tide and that the dying give up their spirit when ebb sets in.7 Here Fludd could have exploited the more active and dynamic retraction-concept of Lurianism (had he known about it), particularly as Luria knows not only one tsimtsum but a series of retractions accompanying, or rather preceding, every stage of creation.s But, as another passage makes abundantly clear, Fludd had not the faintest idea of what is now understood by tsimtsum. He emphasizes that the "potentiall or dark principle" and the "actuall emanation" have brought forth cold and heat respectively. Darkness (and, corresponding to it in physics: cold) is the expression of "divine Nolunty or latent Divinity, and consequently of God's 1 De Verbo Mirifico ii, xiv (in Pistorius, Artis Cabalisticae Scriptores, 1587, p. 926). 2 Heptaplus, iii.

Cf. also Knorr's ref. (p. 107) to contractio prima. 8</page><page sequence="23">112 R. J. ZWI WERBLOWSKY privative property." It is thus the "mother of privation, death, vacuity, inanity, deformation and so forth. For the property of the dark nothing ... is naturally to rest and not to act or operate; and the reason is that all its appetite is to be conversant in, and about the centre, beyond which there is no motion or action, and not to dilate itself towards the circumference, as the Spirit of light, of God in Volunty, or patent nature, is accustomed to do." Cold therefore, unless activated or roused by heat "seemeth to wait upon its drousie mother, Darkness and privation, whose children are fixation and rest." And as if he were at pains to prevent any confusion with the tsimtsum, Fludd states un- equivocally in what sense he wishes retraction to be understood when he speaks of cold as "an essentiall act, proceeding from, and attending on the divine puissance,' which in this property doth contract its beams from the circum- ference unto its self... that is to say, It would not shine forth but retained its activity centrally in itself and so did seem to rest in itself.... In this contracted, or rather separated or private estate therefore of the divine unity, it operateth according unto this its negative property or condition by this essentiall agent Cold."2 Cold, proceeding from God's "hidden or latent property," is thus the agent of "inspissation, contraction, constriction, fixation, immobility, ponderosity, rest, obteneration or darkness, of mortification, stupefaction and such like," whereas the "contrary divine property," that of the "spirit's patent, manifest and positive nature" is emanating, moving, dilating, etc.3 A similar idea is also expressed by Cudworth:4 "God's Power displaied in the world is nothing but his goodness strongly reaching all things from height to depth: and irresistibly imparting itself to everything according to those severall degrees in which it is capable of it," or,5 "the reason why God made the world, was from his own overflowing and communicative goodness." It has thus become clear that, in non-Lurianic Christian kabbalism, "retract" has the purely passive meaning of "being retired, rest, refrain from movement, be self-contained or contain oneself" as opposed to "move, act, reach forth," etc. This usage of "retract" is attested for the period. The N.E.D.6 quotes the meanings "to restrain; to hold back or prevent from some course"; illustrations range from 1548 (Hall) to I670. There is also a reference to the use of the word by Henry More (1668) in the sense of "to restrict or limit to something." There is no similar evidence for "retire," but there is little doubt that this is the meaning it has for Milton in Paradise Lost vii. 170 f. The meaning of the whole passage squares completely with the pre- or non- Lurianic notion of retraction as the hidden God's state of latency, and of creation as his moving outwards, viz. sending forth his creative emanation. Professor Saurat is certainly right in his pointing of the passage.' But this pointing, which is generally accepted,8 hardly proves his case. The lines can 1 I.e. not power, but potentiality. 2 Op. cit., p. 53. 3 Ibid. 4 Quoted by Sewell, Review ofEnglish Studies, XV, I939, P. 77. 6 Cudworth, op. cit., IV, p. I87. 6 Vol. 8.

After all, 'necessitie and Chance,' i.e. Fate, are nothing but manifestations of my own will.2 If, therefore, I am inactive at times, this is because occasionally and for reasons of my own, I prefer not to 'go out of myself' and act, but rather remain retired into myself. Now it is my will that you, my Son, go forth as executor of my will and perform the work of creation."3 The passage, in fact, simply means what everybody took it to mean until the unfortunate intrusion of Rabbinics into Miltonic studies. It cannot be proved with certainty that Milton had in mind either Reuchlin or Fludd. It is probable, but not in the least necessary. The role played by the concept of retraction in Milton's poem shows again (if such evidence was still needed) what has been known for long, that we may not always be able to indicate the precise sources of Milton's ideas, but that we know the intellectual region from which they come and the climate in which they are at home. Milton was clearly "alive to the speculative issues of his time,"4 but the specific Lurianic doctrine of tsimtsum was certainly not one of them. ADDENDUM It has been shown in the foregoing that much of the confusion about "retraction" was due to the dual significance of the Latin retractio, retrahens, etc. It should be added that no such ambiguity attaches either to the Hebr. tsimtsum or to any other relevant kabbalistic term. Tsimtsum is an unequi- vocal technical term of Lurianic kabbalism, whereas the hidden, retreated or retracted God (the Ungrund of the Spanish kabbalists) is described as mith'alem (= retrahens) or tha'alumah (=retrocessus). Confusion arose when the same Latin word was used to render both kabbalistic concepts. The expression 'or hamith'alem "hidden light" occurs frequently in thirteenth-century kabba- listic writings. Professor G. Scholem informs me that the absolute Deity or En Soph is called sether hatha'alumah "mystery of hiddenness" in the Book of Faith and Heresy by R. Azriel of Gerona. I further understand from Professor Scholem that he has incontrovertible evidence that Reuchlin knew this work of R. Azriel. 1 This is a commonplace too. To Henry More the wide and endless stretch of chaos lay "ever equal with the Deity"; see Mc- Colley, loc. cit., p. 223. 2 Cf. St. Thomas, Summa Theol., i. I 16. 2: "Fatum est in causis creatis inquantum or- dinatae sunt a Deo ad aliquos effectus pro- ducendos." "... causaliter Dei potestas vel voluntas dici potest fatum." 3 Cf. also Taylor, op. cit., p. 42, and his quotation from Du Bartas. 4 Rajan, Paradise Lost and the Seventeenth Century Reader, 1947, P.
