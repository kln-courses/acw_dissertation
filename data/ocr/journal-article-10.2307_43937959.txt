<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK / Spring 1997 85 Just Beasts? Plutarch and Modern Science On the Sense of Fair Play in Animals Stephen T. Newmyer Duquesne University Many issues debated by philosophers of the contempo- rary animal rights movement and by scientists who special- ize in the study of animal behavior are anticipated in ancient writers. The question, for example, of whether animals, because of some intrinsic qualities which they possess, are entitled to justice from humans was the subject of fierce debate among the Greeks, and it stands at the forefront of the modern controversy on the moral status of animals (Newmyer, 1992, 44-54). Inquiry into the possible moral standing of animals was a matter of more than idle speculation to the ancients, for if it could be proven that animals do merit justice at the hands of humans, the assumptions that underlie many aspects of the lifestyle of humans would be called into question. Perhaps it would be, after all, morally wrong to put animals to any use that would benefit human beings. No ancient thinkers seem to have found the prospect of renouncing the use of animals so unpalatable as did the Stoics. According to the Neoplatonist philosopher Por- phyry, the Stoics believed that according moral status to animals would compel humans to refrain even from using them for farm labor, lest such a use be dishonorable. This would, in the view of the Stoics, hinder human advance- ment and force humans to live like brutes ( Abst . 1.4). To avoid this unpleasant eventuality, the Stoics espoused a concept of the animal soul which denied it the ability to develop a capacity for reason (logos). Because animals can never reason, they remain, unlike humans, incapable of understanding moral duty. In consequence, humans can never have obligations toward animals, for only those who share values can respect each other's interests. Cicero wrote approvingly of this Stoic doctrine (Fin. 3.67), "But just as they hold that man is united with man by the bonds of right, so they consider that no right exists between man and beast. For Chrysippus well said, that all other things were created for the sake of men and gods, but that these exist for their own mutual fellowship and society, so that men can make use of beasts for their own purposes without injustice" (Rackham 287). The Stoic emphasis on the importance of the capacity for respecting the interests of others in determining human behavior toward animals lives on today in the ethical doctrine termed "Contractarianism," upon which some philosophers who deny rights to animals base their case. In his influential work A Theory of Justice, published in 1971, ethicist John Rawls argued that animals, because they cannot enter into contracts with humans (that is, as the Stoics would say, because they cannot respect human interests), do not have rights (Rawls 512). No ancient writer argued more forcefully against the Stoic denial of reason to animals than did Plutarch, who devoted three treatises of his Moralia to questions relating to the nature and moral status of animals. Plutarch touched upon the question of justice toward animals in De esu carnium (On the Eating of Flesh), a defense of vegetarian- ism (Newmyer, 1995b, 41-43), and in Bruta ammalia ratione uti (Whether Beasts Are Rational ), an amusing parody of Odyssey X cast in the form of a dialogue between Odysseus and the philosophic pig Gryllus ("Grunt- er"), one of Circe's victims who declines the hero's offer to convince the witch to reconvert him into human form and who advances the position that animals are morally superior to humans. Plutarch developed his case for animal rationality at greatest length in the treatise De sollertia animalium (De soll, an.: On the Cleverness of Animals), a dialogue between Plutarch's father Autobulus and his friend Soclarus prompted by a previous encomium on hunting delivered by an unnamed speaker (Martin 99-101). In this treatise, Plutarch, through his interlocutors, exam- ines the question of whether land animals or sea animals are more intelligent, after opening the dialogue with some general observations on the rationality of animals (959B- 965E). Early in this treatise (961D), Plutarch allows Autobulus to assert that the Stoics are themselves inconsis- tent in their position on animal rationality, for they punish their dogs and horses with the intention of producing in them a sense of repentance (metanoia), which would be pointless if such beasts could not reflect rationally on the purpose of chastisement. Animals, he argues, must have some reasoning power to know when to pursue a potential source of food and when to avoid such a pursuit as dangerous (960D). Nor would hunters find the chase so stimulating if they did not feel that they were pitting their wits against those of intelligent and crafty adversaries (965E-F). For Plutarch, it is evidences of such purposeful actions, preparations for the necessities of life, and recollections of positive and negative experiences (prothe - seis kai paraskeuai kai mnemai , 966B) that argue for the presence of reason in animals. Much of Plutarch's argumentation in the three animal- related treatises mentioned above is directed specifically toward a refutation of Stoic opinions on animals. A careful reading of the arguments that constitute the Stoic case against the possession of reason by animals, a tenet which forms the cornerstone of the Stoic case against them, reveals a surprising assumption on the part of the Stoics that underlies their position. In asserting that humans can owe nothing to creatures which are unable to share their values and interests, they imply that humans can owe</page><page sequence="2">86 THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK / Spring 1997 justice only to those who can understand what justice is. As the Contractarians, the modern descendants of Sto- icism, would put the case, humans cannot enter into a contract of justice with a creature that cannot be just in return. Among the many aspects of the ancient debate on the issue of justice toward animals, the question of whether animals exercise justice themselves is only infrequently encountered (Sorabji 119-20). Aristotle, whose pronounce- ments on animals occasionally led him into self-contradic- tions (Sorabji 56-57), did address the question of a sense of justice in animals. While the Peripatetic philosopher was willing to acknowledge that animals possess some forms of intelligence and demonstrate such apparent moral qualities as cleverness, deceptiveness, chastity, and prudence (Hist. An. 488b24-28; 608all-15), he stopped short of allowing them a sense of justice as well on the grounds that justice is a product of reason and animals cannot reason (De An. 428a24). Moreover, Aristotle had stated elsewhere (/W. 1. 2.1253al4-18) that only humans have a sense of good and evil, and of justice and injustice, because only humans can speak and impart their understanding of those concepts to others. Plutarch understood, quite correctly, that the Stoic argument against the idea that animals fall under the purview of human justice depended in part on the assump- tion that animals, because they cannot reason, have themselves no conception of justice and therefore cannot practice it in their lives. He states the position of the Stoics (De soll. an. 964B), "Those who know nothing of right action (&lt; dikaiopragein ) toward us can receive no wrong from us either" (Cherniss and Helmbold 349). While Plutarch was not unique in antiquity in arguing that animals merit justice from humans, he seems to stand alone among extant sources in defending his position, in part, by arguing, against the Stoics, that humans owe justice to animals because animals do understand and abide by a sense of justice. Even scholars sympathetic to Plutarch have long derided many of his claims of animal excellences as mere pilfering from earlier Greek commonplace books on animals, and have dismissed many of his assertions as unsubstantiated and fanciful, the sort of charges often levelled against the observations of Greek naturalists (Dickerman 123-30; d'Agostino 35). Many educated laymen today would certainly side with skeptical Plutarch- ists in regarding the notion that animals understand the concept of justice as farfetched. Yet in the past two decades, some ethologists, those biologists who specialize in the study of the characteristic behavioral patterns of animals, have become increasingly willing to countenance the belief that at least some species of animals may indeed possess an elementary sense of justice. As Dutch ethologist Frans deWaal states the case, "Although human reciprocity and justice are undoubtedly far more developed than anything seen in other animals, there is more common ground than most students of law and ethics are aware of" (deWaal 161). In some instances, the types of animals upon whose behavior Plutarch based his case are the same as those in whom modern ethologists like deWaal have detected a sense of what they term "reciprocal justice," that is, the desire to repay acts of kindness or cruelty. The concept of justice in animals that is developed in Plutarch's treatises closely mirrors this modern concept of "reciprocal justice," and Plutarch nowhere claims to detect in animals any manifestations of the sophisticated concepts of justice that appear in the philosophies of Aristotle or the Stoics. Plutarch's case for a sense of justice in animals rested on both a logical argument for its existence and on analysis of examples of animal behaviors that appeared to him to suggest that animals repay acts of kindness toward them and react with indignation at unprovoked acts of cruelty toward them. As was often the case with Plutarch's attempts to discredit Stoic theories, he built his own case by following to their conclusion- and thereby controvert- ing-ideas which he encountered in Stoic doctrine, as he had done in pointing out the absurdity of punishing animals if they cannot reflect on the purpose of punishment. The Stoic theory of the origin of justice is set forth at length in Cicero (Fin. 5.65). They held, he tells us, that virtue is born out of the emotion of parental love for offspring, and this partnership of interests and human affection (communi- catio utilitatum et ipsa cantas generis humani) eventually comes to encompass the whole of the human race. In a related discussion earlier in the same treatise (Fin. 3.62), Cicero had observed that the Stoics acknowledge the bond of parental affection even in animals. Yet while this bond of affection unites humans to humans, it serves at the same time in Stoic doctrine to exclude animals from human concern since they share no natural fellowship with humans (Sandbach 32-34). Plutarch sought in De soll. an. 962 A-F to point out the shortcomings of this argument, declaring (962A), "While they postulate that love of one's offspring is the very foundation of our social life and administration of justice, and observe that animals possess such love in a very marked degree, yet they assert and hold that animals have no part in justice" (Cherniss and Helmbold 337). The mistake of the Stoics, he charges (962C), is to confuse the imperfection of a virtue with its absence. Just as they are wrong to deny some reason to animals because they do not partake of perfect reason, so they are wrong to deny that animals understand justice because they do not understand the perfection of justice, if indeed an understanding of justice arises from love of offspring, and even they are willing to admit that animals love their offspring tenderly (962C-D). Plutarch supported this line of argument with a series of examples of animal behavior that suggested to him that not only do animals practice justice but they actively seek it from humans. In a particularly moving example in his treatise on vegetarianism (De esu carnium 994D), Plutarch envisions an animal about to be slaughtered pleading with his slayer to spare him if he intends to eat him not out of necessity but only to provide a more elaborate meal. Yet humans ignore these entreaties, assuming that the animal's utterances are inarticulate squeals and cries, and not the requests for justice (dikaiologias) that they, in fact, are. Plutarch considered a sense of justice to be highly</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK / Spring 1997 87 developed in elephants. He reports (De soll. an. 968E) that an elephant living in Rome which had been repeatedly tormented by boys who stuck him with their styluses, picked up one of the boys and threatened to toss him. But when bystanders cried out, the elephant put the boy down unharmed, "... thinking it sufficient punishment (arkou- san diken) for one so young to have been frightened" (Cherniss and Helmbold 375). No animal's behavior so fascinated ancient writers as did that of dolphins, a beast whom Plutarch calls "philan- thropic" (philanthropoñ , De soll. an. 984C), and all students of classical literature are familiar with Herodotus' charming tale of how the singer Arion of Methymna was rescued by a dolphin when thrown overboard by greedy sailors (Hdt. 1.23-24). Plutarch retold this tale at length ( Conv . sept. sap. 160F), substituting a school of dolphins for Herodotus' single animal, in order to make a case for a sense of justice in dolphins. Each dolphin, in Plutarch's version, took a turn in bearing Arion to land, relieving his fellows of their heavy burden as though such a service were obligatory and incumbent upon them all ( leitourgema . . . prosekon pasin). Plutarch's most touching example of an apparent sense of justice in dolphins concerns a young boy who played and swam regularly with a dolphin who allowed himself to be ridden. Once, during a storm, the boy fell off the dolphin and was drowned. The dolphin bore the body to land and lay beside it until he had died too, "thinking it right ( dikaiosas )," Plutarch observes (De soll. an. 984F), "to share a death for which it imagined that it shared the responsibility" (Cherniss and Helmbold 475). It must be admitted that Plutarch was no naturalist, and that the examples of animal behavior found in his works are traceable already in Aristotle (Hist. An.) and Pliny ( HN ), and would reappear after Plutarch in Aelian (NA) and Porphyry (Abst.) (Dickerman 123-30; Dierauer 279- 93), but what renders Plutarch's use of the material so interesting is his insistence upon the idea that such behav- iors argue for a sense of justice in animals, a belief either denied or ignored by Greek naturalists and philosophers (Sorabji 119-21), not to mention by most modern scien- tists. Since the 1970s, however, that situation has been slowly changing in some scientific circles. In their book When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals, published in 1995, Jeffrey Masson and Susan McCarthy, clearly alluding to the sort of anecdotal material of Greek zoological compendia from which Plutarch's examples are ultimately derived, observe, "The stories of crow parlia- ments that hold trials and pass judgment on their members are fantasy, but less organized manifestations of what may be a sense of justice exist in many stories of righteously indignant chimps, for example" (Masson and McCarthy 214). In one such case, psychologist Herbert Terrace, in the 1970s, reported that the chimpanzee Nim Chimsky- whose name is an amusing play on Noam Chomsky, the linguist who questioned the linguistic capabilities of chimpanzees- learned to expect praise for good deeds and punishment for bad behavior. He would sulk if not praised by one trainer for acts that other trainers praised, or if punished for actions that other trainers accepted. Terrace considered this an example of Nim's developing sense of justice (Terrace 114). Ethologist Frans deWaal, in his work Good Natured : The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals , published in 1996, cites numerous examples of an apparent sense of justice in chimpanzees that he has collected from his years as a research scientist at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta. In one such instance of apparent reciprocal justice, the chimpanzee Puist helped her friend Luit to chase off a rival named Nikkie. Nikkie cornered Puist and behaved in a hostile manner toward her, but when Puist reached her hand out to Luit to ask for help, Luit ignored her. As soon as Nikkie left the scene, Puist turned to Luit and began shouting at him, and eventually chased him away and beat him. DeWaal comments on this incident, "If Puist's fury was in fact the result of Luit's failure to help her after she had helped him, the incident suggests that reciprocity in chimpanzees may be governed by obligations and expectations similar to those in humans" (deWaal 97). Marine ethologists have corroborated the ancient belief that animals of the order Cetacea, which includes whales and dolphins, are among the most intelligent of animals, and a number of such scientists have observed behaviors in dolphins and whales that argue for a sense of justice. Pioneering ethologist Donald R. Griffin, a specialist in animal cognition, reports on the "aiding behavior" of dolphins who will raise up to the water's surface those dolphins who appear to be weak or ill so that the distressed animals may breathe. In a manner that recalls Plutarch's tale of the philanthropic dolphins who aided Arion, Griffin observes, "The instances of dolphins aiding human swimmers presumably result from similar behavior" (Griffin 214). Biologist Karen Pry or recounts an incident that bears a striking resemblance to Plutarch's tale of the tormented elephant. A killer whale named Ola had been secretly teased by one of his trainers. During a training session, Ola pulled the trainer to the bottom of the tank while the man was dressed in diving gear and not in danger of drowning. He held the trainer under water for five minutes and would not respond to commands or offers of food. After Ola released his trainer, the man admitted to having teased the whale, who repaid him, in Pryor's view, with a frightening lesson in reciprocal justice (Masson and McCarthy 174). Skeptics might argue that, despite the fact that the data gathered by ethologists represent thousands of hours of close observation under controlled field or lab conditions by highly trained specialists, the modern case for a sense of justice in animals rests, as it did for Plutarch, on evidence that is tentative, highly anecdotal, controversial, and open to the charge of anthropomorphism. Indeed, ethologists are willing to acknowledge that their conclu- sions are still open to such criticisms. As deWaal observes (209), "Even if animals other than ourselves act in ways tantamount to moral behavior, their behavior does not</page><page sequence="4">88 THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK / Spring 1997 necessarily rest on deliberations of the kind we engage in. " Only when the intentionality of animal behavior can be conclusively proven can a sense of justice or of other moral qualities in animals be taken as fact: that is, scien- tists must demonstrate that animals intend to be just, or generous, or kind. This consideration did not occur to Plutarch or to other ancient writers who sought to derive moral lessons for humans from animal behavior, and it lay beyond the capability of ancient science to prove such intentionality. DeWaal does maintain, however, that to classify an instance of sharing of food or of embracing an injured companion as instinct in animals but moral decency in humans, is probably misleading and unfair (deWaal 210). Ethologists point out that it is now scientifically demonstrable that such moral concepts as honesty, guilt, and the weighing of moral dilemmas can be traced to certain areas in the human brain. Since the human brain is a product of evolution, and the central nervous system of human beings is quite similar to that of other mammals, perhaps a moral sense antedates humanity after all (deWaal 218). Plutarch's case may seem naive when placed beside the findings of modern biology, but he has at least antici- pated a line of argument that is sure to be vigorously pursued by scientists, ethicists, and activists concerned with the question of man's obligations toward non-human animals.
