By Arlene Marturano Last and activity grade ing. school Through year, geography participated students that the links planting - fourth- garden- science at in gar- my an grade students at my school participated in an activity that links science and geography - garden- ing. Through planting gar- dens similar to those of four regional native American tribes, the children created a concrete example of native culture, a "snapshot in time." How did the project turn out? It was won- derful, a truly memorable learning experience for students and teachers. The Plot Begins We teachers began our research on several fronts. We contacted archae- ologists in the state who had recon- structed ancient gardens, and we vis- ited a museum that had replicated a Catawba garden. We also attended a native foods festival to see how gar- den yield and wild foods were pre- pared. We read avidly everything avail- able on the regional tribes, including books, journals, and seed catalogs. When we felt secure enough in our background knowledge to put our ideas into action, we assigned each of the four fourth-grade classes to re- search, design, plant, maintain, and harvest a garden typical of one of four native American tribes - the Iroquois of the Northeast, the Sioux of the Mid- west, the Hopi of the Southwest, and the Cherokee of the Southeast. The children did library research to learn more about these gardens, especially what crops were grown, how the gar- dens were plotted, and where native seeds could be found today. Through reading archaeological and historical records, the children discovered that evidence gathered from plant and seed remains, garden- ing tools, food production artifacts, and analysis of human bones provides clues to the crops grown. Historical accounts from early settlers, explor- ers, and naturalists are intriguing re- sources for students since they often describe native farming practices and foods. For example, a man named Wil- liam Bartram, who wrote of his trav- els throughout the Southeast in the 1700s, reported that the native Ameri- cans made the hickory nut into a cream and added it to hominy and corn cakes (Van Dorn, 1924, p. 57). Interviews of native peoples made by anthropologists yield detailed ac- counts of gardening practices. Three of the most readable and delightful accounts for children were tran- scribed by Gilbert L. Wilson: Goodbird the Indian: His Story; Waheenee: An Indian Girl's Story; and Buffalo Bird Woman's Garden. Such interviews can also suggest a format for students to follow if they have the opportunity to talk with contemporary native Americans. One of my students, whose heritage is Choctaw, told us that she had planted a Choctaw garden of sun- flowers, corn, beans, squash, and wa- termelon at home while studying her family genealogy. By contacting the archaeology de- partment at our state university, we found an archaeologist, Gail Wagner, to help us with our project. She had already done one native American gar- den reconstruction and she became an enthusiastic advisor to us, opening our eyes to the wild plants on the school grounds - peppergrass, goose- 26 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN FEBRUARY 1995</page><page sequence="2">The children enjoy working in the sunshine with seeds, soil, and science. oc O % ba ? o ifí 8 foot, sumac, and barley - that were food sources for native Americans. Seeds of Science Since we wanted the garden to present an authentic portrait of the past, we decided to plant native, or heirloom, seeds, which we found through seed catalogs and seed-saver exchanges. Seed-saver exchanges are sources of heirloom varieties collected by home gardeners who are dedicated to con- serving the crop heritage of our coun- try. After a harvest, exchange mem- bers return a portion of the resulting seeds to the exchange. Students can participate as seed guardians while growing heirloom gardens. (See box for more information.) Seed catalogs are treasures of his- torical and scientific information. Searching for seeds can become a mysterious and competitive quest for students. As seed explorers, our stu- dents charted the catalogs for native American varieties, finding Hopi blue flint corn and tepary beans, dipper and bottle gourds, scarlet runner beans, Cherokee blue and white dent corn, and purple tepee beans.

Because deliveries can take up to eight weeks, you should place your order at least three months before planting time. Once the seeds arrived, students examined them with hand lenses, not- ing the variety of seed shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. Our archaeolo- gist advisor obtained electron micro- photographs for us, which we showed students through the slide projector. A Sunflower Fence The space available for our garden plots was behind and adjacent to the fourth-grade portable classrooms. When planning this type of project, it is best to do a soil test six months ahead.

The tall and graceful older sister, corn, supports her younger sister, the bean, who twines around her. Squash, the youngest sister, spreads at the feet of the others and protects them from harm. As our plantings of corn, beans, and squash grew, we encouraged the students to interpret the ancient myth in contemporary scientific terms. First, we pointed out that the practice of planting more than one crop together is referred to as interplanting and is still done today. The advantages of this method include conserving soil moisture (squash, for example, acts as a mulch, preventing soil erosion and evaporation from the soil surface) and reducing damage from pests that target only one specific crop. Also, as crops use nutrients from the soil, interplanted companions resupply nutrients needed by each other. For example, the bacteria within the bean plant's root nodules fix nitrogen gas in the atmosphere into a form that the other plants can use. Moreover, these three crops supplied a variety of dietary nutrients that sustained generations of natives. Beans and corn eaten together, for example, are complementary protein sources, because each is low in different essential amino acids. Nevertheless, the ancient myth of the "three sisters" has a decidedly unscientific, anthropomorphic flavor. Through further discussion and obser- vation, the students began to realize that the plants were not protecting each other with sisterly devotion, rather they were competing for light and water and for mineral nutrients in the soil without regard to their neighbors' fate. (If the beans are vigorous enough, they will climb up the corn stalks and shade them so much that no ears of corn will develop.) It is important that students conclude on their own that it is incorrect and misleading for us to think of plants as having emotions. Rather, it is phototropism and hydrotro- pism that explain the plants' movements. truckloads of organic compost that we obtained from the county com- post (not sludge) site. Along with the compost, lime and a 5-10-10 starter fertilizer were tilled into the soil prior to planting. We discussed with stu- dents the fact that the sandy soil avail- able to us would not have been a site chosen by native Americans for a gar- den. Rather, they would have pre- ferred riverbanks rich in humus. Al- though we were adding chemical fertilizer to begin the garden, we hoped that eventually our plot would become fertile through composting and interplanting. Seeking advice and assistance on soil preparation from the county ex- tension agent and/or master garden- ers will help to ensure proper proce- dures and schedules for planting in a given region of the country. Students can compare the native American planting legends to contemporary rec- ommendations. For example, the Iroquois planted corn when the leaves of the dogwood tree were as big as a squirrel's ear (Eames-Sheavly, 1993, p. 18); today, horticulturists recom- mend that corn be sown in a warm soil, approximately 15-18°C. Influenced by Buffalo Bird Woman's narrative on garden design, the children decided that each of the four rectangular plots would measure 6 m long by 3 m wide and have a sunflower fence (we found similar plot designs in the literature on the Iroquois [Eames-Sheavly, 1993, pp. 18-19]). For the fence, we sowed three sunflower seeds per hole and spaced the holes about 30 cm apart. Native American tribes valued the sunflower stalk for its fibers and used the seed to make oil and to eat. Within the sunflower fence, the children made hills 30 cm high and 45 cm in diameter, spaced about 1 m apart. Then, because the literature continually named corn and beans as staple native American crops, the stu- dents planted five to seven corn seeds on each hilltop and four to five bean seeds on each surrounding slope. The one-meter spaces between hills were planted in pumpkins, squashes, gourds, and other crops unique to a tribe; the Hopi plot, for example, also contained amaranth, chia, and water- melon (see box, page 29). Once the garden was planted, maintenance began. A calendar that included reminders about watering, weeding, fertilizing, and scouting for problems was mounted in the class- room. It scheduled pairs of students to handle the tasks on a rotating, weekly basis. The calendar also noted the dates predicted by the seed pack- ets for germination (which we later compared to actual germination dates). For the summer break, we re- 28 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN FEBRUARY 1995</page><page sequence="4">What Does Your Garden Grow? The following list shows the varieties we planted for each type of garden.

The school custo- dial staff, anxious to share in the har- vest and extremely helpful through- out the project, assisted with the garden tasks as well. Harvest Bounty We planted the seeds in April and by late June beans, gourds, and pump- kins were appearing. Over the sum- mer, teachers, parents, and students visited the gardens on both an im- promptu and scheduled basis to wa- ter, weed, fertilize, scout for signs of disease, and observe the developing harvest. The following autumn, the same students, now in fifth grade, gathered the yield and welcomed the new fourth-grade students to the gar- dening experience by sharing seeds, recipes, and success stories. We ex- perimented with historic native American recipes like Iroquois succotash, Hopi tepary beans, Sioux sunflower seed balls, and Cherokee corn cakes. Searching for such reci- pes can be just as exciting as prepar- ing and sampling these delicious dishes. For example, Buffalo Bird Woman gives a detailed description of how to make a breakfast mush, mapi nakapa, from hard white flint corn (Wilson, 1987, p. 60). For a class treat, we adapted this succotash recipe from Heritage Gar- FEBRUARY 1995 dening - Vegetables by Jane Taylor (see Resources). Ingredients 4 strips bacon 4 chopped onions 2 L lima beans 1 L water 2 L frozen corn 120 mL margarine Directions Place the bacon, beans, and onions in water and bring to a boil. Simmer 20 minutes. Add corn and margarine and simmer another 10 minutes. This serves 24 students. Reenacting harvest rituals can be enjoyable for students, who especially relish making and eating the "mess." Tasting the harvest enhances memory and retention of native contributions to our lives. The children can also do such crafts as cornhusk dolls, gourd bowls and ladles, and seed necklaces. By practicing specific seed-saving techniques, we can maintain our seed reserves for years to come; in fact, we will even have a surplus of seeds avail- able for trading, selling, and return- ing to seed exchanges. To preserve seeds, students will need to air-dry them (try setting the seeds on a screen) for seven to 10 days. Then the seeds should be placed in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. Add 30 mL silica gel or powdered milk to the in- side of the jar to absorb excess mois- ture. Label each container as to con- tents and date placed in storage.
