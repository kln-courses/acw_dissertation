<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEOPLE, BERDACHES, AND LEFT-HANDED BEARS: HUMAN VARIATION IN NATIVE AMERICA Jay Miller American Indian Studies, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 The Native cultures of North America recognize a bewilderingly large range of people, only some of whom are human. Focusing on four widely scattered tribes (Nootka, Keres, Kootenay, Winne- bago) with examples from several others (Blackfeet, Pomo, Ojibwa, Tsimshian, Lenape Delaware), this paper examines the mediating role played by berdaches, bears, and others in these cultures. Consideration is also given to variations in the psychological, categorical, and symbolic aspects of gender and of the culture/nature continuum. AN INTRIGUING FEATURE of Native American conversation is the frequent refer- ence to "people" of various sorts, who are not usually human in European terms. Underlying these references, it seems to me, is a common view of the universe as anthropomorphic-if not in form then in emotions and personality-in keeping with what Mary Douglas (1970:98, 104) has called a pre-Copernican, or anthropocentric universe. Over and over again, elders make reference to animal people, plant people, water people, spirit people, rock people, and many others, while at the same time recog- nizing the unique position of human people at the center of the overall plan of the cosmos. All of these cosmologies are based upon a pervasive belief in humanoid beings, suggesting that Amerind tribes use a flexible definition of what constitutes humanity in order to justify such a great range of people. As a preliminary attempt to grasp this definition, this paper will look at a few interrelated examples within particular tribes, which bear on the generalities involved. Miller (1979) discussed several universal categories that are important for effi- ciently articulating the structural configuration (abbreviated as strucon) of a culture. In rank order from the most confined to the most extensive, these categories in- volve handedness, gender, and biota. In light of these categories, we will consider complex interactions involving the symbolic importance of left priority, the ber- dache-transsexual, and bears, especially grizzlies. While information on these topics from each of the tribes is not always complete, such data do exist for the Nootka (West Coast People) of Vancouver Island, the Keres Pueblos of New Mexico, the Kootenay of British Columbia, and the Winnebago of Wisconsin. Because it has some bearing on the overall argument, we will also consider Delaware data relative to these categories, so as to suggest why the berdache role, so common elsewhere in Native America, was singularly lacking in the Northeast, among the Iroquois and the Coastal Algonkians. From all of the available evidence, it appears that the Nootka, Keres, Kootenay, Winnebago, and Delaware use gender as the organizing, most pervasive tenet of their cultures. Complementarity of the sexes is, therefore, the dominant metaphor for expressing the tension that unifies and diversifies these cultures. Within the context of mythology, such a tension serving as the keystone of a culture has been variously called a paideuma by Leo Frobenius (Miller 1979) and an armature by Claude Ldvi- Strauss (1969). In practice, however, it is more like an echo reverberating throughout a culture, at all levels and times. 274</page><page sequence="2">PEOPLE, BERDACHES, AND BEARS 275 These reverberations have different forms in different cultures, depending upon the way in which the components of the gender echo are defined in the format. Basically, the format has three components, serially defined in terms of a notion of concentric degrees of confinement, or limitation. The echo itself consists of a dominant pair, one member of which is defined as exclusive (inside, closed, and positioned) within the other member, which is inclusive (outside, open). For ex- ample, in almost all human cultures, gender is defined such that Woman is the demarcated, exclusive category within the inclusive category of Man. Further integrating these pairs is the notion of mediation, in which mediators are defined as inclosive, partaking of the attributes of each member of a pair as well as of qualities from a third dimension unique to mediators, making them inclosive of the entire system. Such inclosiveness is a constant in all cultures, although the hierarchical position of individual mediators will vary from culture to culture. For those with a Man/Woman tension, the most universal mediator is that of Mind (consciousness, thought, memory), variously represented as a high god, water, fire, or other sacred centers permeating the cosmos (Miller 1980a, 1980b). Mind itself shares with other mediators the quality of being a permeating nexus of channels, or webbing, for the reverberations of the cultural echo throughout the organization. While the universal equation seems to be Man (Mind) Woman as inclusive (in- closive) exclusive, certain cultures have deliberately manipulated this analogy to establish their own distinctive configuration. Hence, while the Delaware follow this norm (as the Nootka and Winnebago also seem to), the Keres and Kootenay have reversed it so that Man is exclusive and Woman inclusive (Miller 1972). In fact enough comparative data already exist to propose that the pan-human norm is an equation of the inclusive with the dominant, the right side, Man, animals, and winter; or of the exclusive with the subordinate, the left side, Woman, plants, and summer. While exceptions do occur, they often appear to be intended to reinforce the tribal identity by emphasizing intercultural differences (Miller 1974). Other examples of this process appearing below are the left priority found in revitalization or nativistic movements such as the Delaware Big House Cult or the Great Lakes Midewiwin instituted by the mythic Bear. As right/left, Man/Woman, and animal/ plant are obvious and rich polarities for coding the world and for relating to neighbors through similarity and reversals, so are some other natural phenomena appropriate for serving as mediators. In addition to the ones listed above, the following analysis will show that berdaches and bears also function as important mediators. Throughout Native America, the bear is viewed as the great healer, patron of herbalists and shamans, because its large size, many human characteristics, and frequent grubbing for roots and plants encourages such links with medicines and supernatural power. Further, being omnivorous, bears are often in competition with humans for the same foods, and thus have been much in human awareness. It seems probable, therefore, that bears came to be regarded as left-handed, as a means of distinguishing them specifically from humans. As has been frequently noted, bears are often regarded as pseudohuman or humanoid, much as apes are by many cul- tures; unlike apes, known to most Americans only from zoo cages, Native Americans correctly viewed bears as dangerous and unpredictable, sometimes equating them with the worst aspects of Nature. There is, moreover, the possibility that bears are</page><page sequence="3">276 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH regarded as left-handed because their harvesting of plant foods links them with women. For example, out of great respect for the power of bears, most tribes never use the species name directly, but instead insist on the use of circumlocutions that often include a version of terms like "auntie" or "female affine" for addressing bears when they are encountered. The justification for this seems to relate to a widespread belief in a special affinal relationship between hunter and prey in the Americas. Tales abound in references to courtship and marriage between humans and other "people" who are often sources of food, with the right to kill and eat these species derived from a mythic charter setting up reciprocities as a result of the original marriage. Of note in this regard are the widely distributed stories about Star, Bear, Frog, Maize, Salmon, and other spouses. These marriages can be consummated and produce viable off- spring because under the robe of each species the males and females are really humanoid. While this is implied for all species, it is most obvious in the case of the large mammals, especially bears. In this way, bears have come to symbolize relations with the entire animal kingdom, making bears particularly suitable for spouses in myths chartering economic and ritual relations of reciprocity. While this seems to be the context of generalized bear beliefs in America, specific tribes have developed their own versions within the framework of their own culture. In addition, bear beliefs can be compared with those associated with the berdache, since both of them seem to relate to the overall definition of humanness. Because they are regarded as intermediate between Man and Woman in some sense, berdaches also serve to mediate many aspects of culture. It is actually only the formal, insti- tutionalized berdache role that has bearing here, not the effeminate characteristics, relating more to personality than to social structure (Broch 1977). The four cultures about to be considered represent four different languages and culture areas, suggesting that these relations are much more widespread in America than available evidence would indicate. The Nootka, now usually called West Coast People, comprised about a dozen political divisions along the western shore of Vancouver Island. With the Kwakiutl (Kwakwala), they make up the Wakashan stock and belong to the central province of the Northwest Coast, or North Pacific culture area. The Keres inhabit seven pueblos in central New Mexico, belong to the South- west, or Oasis area, and speak a language classified as an isolate, although their participation in the Oshara archaeological continuum suggests an ultimate ancestry in the Hokan stock. The Kootenay also speak a language classed as an isolate, and are scattered in several bands along the river and lake of the same name, on either side of the British Columbia and Idaho-Montana border. While placed in the Plateau, or Intermontane culture area, the Upper (Eastern) Kootenay, along the river, were strongly influenced by the Plains area, while the Lower (Western) Kootenay, along the lake, were more of the Plateau type. Much Kootenay research remains unpub- lished, so the citations found below are all the more remarkable. Among the most recent revisions to our understanding is the work of Lawrence Morgan (1980), indicating that Kootenay and Proto-Salishan are collaterals of an earlier parent language. The Winnebago have largely remained in their homeland around Green Bay, Wisconsin, speak a Macro-Siouan language, and have been placed in the Great Lakes province of the East culture area. Yet for all these differences, each of these</page><page sequence="4">PEOPLE, BERDACHES, AND BEARS 277 four cultures shares beliefs about left-handed bears and berdache, within a general context of gender symbolism. THE NOOTKA Like that of other Northwest Coast societies, Nootka social structure empha- sizes rank and class within the ambilateral descent system common to the central province. In practice it happened that rank was a prerogative of the noble class, in contrast to commoners, the other freeborn class; both freeborn classes were distinct from that of slaves. Gender echoed through this society in terms of complementarity in economics, the inheritance of rank and privileges, marriage arrangements, and seating at feasts, potlatches, and shamanic dancing (Drucker 1951:28ff, 36ff, 267). Fixed seating at public events was the prime expression of rank and class, so it is significant that at one potlatch chiefs sat at one end of the house, with men on the right and women on the left (Drucker 1951:263). More importantly, during the initiation of new members into the Shamans' Dance, "the most important cere- monial of the Nootkan tribes" and key privilege of high rank (Drucker 1951:439), seating ignored distinctions of rank and used only that of gender. Based on the elaborate rituals and patterns of female seclusion and the prohibition of women from ocean travel, Woman is the exclusive gender; the lack of any comparable re- strictions suggest that Man is the inclusive one. According to Drucker (1951:331), both male and female transvestites were known among the Nootka, but they were few in number, generally characterized by a preference for the work of the opposite sex. Such women were famous warrior leaders who had been given supernatural sanction successfully to undertake such a career, while the men performed female tasks like berdaches elsewhere. As most tribes recognize only male berdaches, these females in male roles indicate the full complementarity of the sexes found elsewhere among the Nootka. The Nootkans gave priority to the right, as indicated by the fact that eating with the left hand was considered a deliberate insult to everyone present. The only physi- cal punishment Drucker (1951:130) noted was striking a child's left hand with a warm stick, to encourage him or her to be right-handed. While in quest of a guardian spirit, children were told they could receive shamanistic power from a right hand sticking from the ground and shaking a rattle, but to flee from a similar disembodied left hand, since it would confer only death (Drucker 1951:153, 185). Nonetheless, bears were considered to be left-handed by the Nootka. In his study of social dialects among the Nootka, Sapir (1915:7) noted that in stories and jokes bears speak using left-handed speech forms. Northern Nootka bear hunters ate with the left hand so as to identify more closely with their quarry. Bears were killed to supply meat and grease, while the skin was used to make shirts for ritual bathers to warm themselves in after a chilly ordeal. Once killed, the bear was brought home from the trap and tied into an upright posture at the rear of the house, with four white mats holding dried salmon in front of it. A chief or other important person sprinkled eagle down on its head, such as was done for any ranking guest, and issued formal greetings. Later the bear was taken to another part of the house and butchered, while chiefs ate the dried salmon from the mats, since it was said to be a gift to them from the bear. Drucker (1951:</page><page sequence="5">278 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH 180) was impressed by this ritual attention, but perplexed because bears were of such minor economic importance. The point of this ritual, however, is not economic but ideological; to borrow arguments from a characterization of totemism, bears are much better to think with than to eat (Levi-Strauss 1962), because of all the animal people they are the most similar to humans. In a collection of tales written by a contemporary Nootka author and artist, we learn that "During the berry season Momma Bear would pick berries with her left hand. It is said that all bears are left handed. They do everything with their left hands" (Clutesi 1967:65). According to another story, a famous bear trapper named Liaik once came upon a person with very white skin fasting, praying, scurbbing, and plunging at a remote pond in order to gain the power to defeat the two traps owned by Liaik. The trapper learned from his hidden observations and began to use the same procedures, vastly increasing his own hunting success because he had learned the techniques used by bears (Drucker 1951:166). The point of the story is that bears without their skin robes are just like humans-able to speak, share the same ritual, and recognize a moral world. When women and others are frightened by bears in the berry patches, they shout to warn them away, calling bears by a title translated as "noble lady, wife of a chief, queen," regardless of the actual sex of the bear. The same title is also used for whales, which were courageously hunted by Nootkan nobles in the recent past. The implication is that by evoking these affinal relationships, eaters and eaten are reminded of their existing mutual respect and reciprocity. While the Nootka are fully aware that bear people have the same two genders as humans, their overall might and ambiguity made bears natural mediators between humans and other kinds of people, as will be more fully explored in the conclusion. THE KERES In the Southwest, the Keres Pueblos make much of the doctoring abilities of bears in keeping with the more widespread belief, but as with all other Pueblo cul- tures, they have formalized this belief into a number of institutionalized priesthoods working for the benefit of the whole community. Individual power is considered to be selfish and is distrusted; only power channeled through a priesthood is ever acceptable. The remarkable aspect of this systemization, however, is that while each priesthood taps a particular power source, all of the priests as a group are known as bears, and accordingly use the left hand while curing. At the pueblo of Sia (White 1962), which in this regard is typical of all seven towns, Bear is the patron of all the curing priesthoods, the guardian of the west, sponsor of the Bear matriclan, a masked deity among the Katsina, and expressly left-handed. An individual who kills a bear must channel his success for the public good by joining a minor priesthood that constitutes a vestige of the warrior, or enemy-slayer cult. In this last regard, the killing of a bear is specifically equated with the killing of a human. When a Keres medicine man, or priest, performs a cure, he wears a bear-claw necklace and bear-paw skins on the left or both hands (Lange 1968:195). This use of the left is not limited to doctoring, however, since the Keres are one of the few cultures in the world who have a left priority (Miller 1972) as the general rule. In the theocracy governing each town, a leader is succeeded by his left-hand man, who</page><page sequence="6">PEOPLE, BERDACHES, AND BEARS 279 had previously served as assistant. The second assistant is the right-hand man, and he then moves up to become the heir and left-hand man. The most senior initiate then becomes the right-hand man. In all, then, men are associated with left, priest- hoods, animals, and death, because they are killers; women are associated with right, matriclans, plants, and birth. Moreover, Man is exclusive and Woman inclusive in the Keresan scheme of things, reversing the nearly universal pattern of gender and concentric attributes. Male berdaches occur among the Keres, talking, dressing, and acting like women. White (1943:325) provides a particularly detailed account of the way in which a boy was pressured and manipulated into becoming a berdache, indicating that the role represents a structural need in society. His data derive from an 1851 examina- tion of an Acoma berdache by a surgeon, William Hammond. Female berdaches are not reported, although Curtis (1926:134) did learn of two women who became ill in 1910 and insisted on initiation into the Giant priesthood. After community up- roar and sadness, they were initiated into this lesser priesthood on the stipulation that they act and dress like men during cures. From this account, it appears that the women did not become berdaches, intermediate between the sexes, but rather became men by a cultural fiction. This is much the same way in which the priest in charge of each town is said to become a woman after installation, even though he maintains a married, family life outside the office. Similarly, in northern California, where most shamans were biologically women, they were known by a term meaning "real men," indicating that their long period of disciplined training had turned them culturally into men (Thomas Buckley, personal communication). These examples indicate the wide cultural range permissible to gender roles, including not only other physiological species, but also individuals with a physiological make-up more appro- priate to one category, who through determination and training assume the other form. They transpose themselves between the genders, but do not blur these distinc- tions as does the berdache. From this perspective, the berdache can be seen even more clearly as occupying a separate status, belonging to neither gender but standing somewhere between them. If individuals can choose or be made to switch their gender identity for reasons of personality, ritual, and ideology, the berdache must be regarded as having had a similar option to assume a third position mediating between the other two. This implies that there is not so much a continuum of human variation in Native America, as there is a set of cultural categories with which individuals can affiliate at will or via supernatural sanctions. The Keres provide a telling case for the argument, since they have a left priority for humans and bears, male berdaches, and a highly structured society based on the tension between male cults and matriclans. After being killed, bears are welcomed into the household and community with the same regard as slain deer and other large mammals, much as honored guests are also greeted and feted. The affinal connection between humans and bear people seems to apply among the Keres as elsewhere, and bears and doctors are both considered nurturant and, thereby, Womanly in the Keres context. The reasoning behind the left priority is based on the observation that the left hand is closer to the heart, the locus of both thought and emotions. Among the</page><page sequence="7">280 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Keres, social classes are based on access to knowledge of an esoteric sort, so that a closer association with the left and the heart for men serves to indicate that they are more knowledgeable. This reversal of the right/left polarity is, furthermore, in keep- ing with several other reversals in the association of the sexes and seasons that help to distinguish the Keres from close Pueblo neighbors such as the Tewa (Miller 1974). Keres boys can become berdaches, but girls cannot, because the semantic cate- gories already assert that men are only Manly, while women have the qualities of both genders because Woman is inclusive. A woman attempting to become a categorical Man would be losing much of her self-esteem, while a man becoming a Womanlike berdache would be enhancing his own status to some extent, allowing for some personal opposition from friends or relatives who had their own plans for the individual. It is fitting that in the reported instance of women seeking male privileges they were attempting to become priests rather than ordinary men, although in conse- quence they had to become like other men who had gone through a more natural initiation into the priesthood. As will be considered in the conclusion, these con- centric attributes have much bearing on the handedness, genders, and biological solutions utilized in different cultures. THE KOOTENAY The Kootenay, like the Keres, use the concentric attributes of gender to link men with the inside and exclusive, women with the outside and inclusive. For example, when a man died the frame of the tipi was destroyed; for a woman, the floor and lodge coverings were destroyed. Unlike the Keres, however, the Kootenay associated men with right priority-the right side of the lodge was the honored section where men sat (Turney-High 1941:60). The left side was associated with women and con- sidered harmless. Bear hunters identified with their prey by using the left hand, because "the grizzly bear is regarded as left-handed" (Schaeffer 1966:50 n. 22). As myths make clear, animals are basically humans or humanoids wearing the cloak of their species. As Boas (1918:93) noted, "the coat of Grizzly Bear is a skin. He put it on and became a grizzly bear." Both grizzly and black bears were hunted for their grease, meat, and hides, while the grizzly was also sought after as a very powerful, if dan- gerous, guardian spirit. A special Grizzly Bear Rite was formerly held (before the tribe's conversion to Catholicism) in early March, when medicine bundles were unfolded and renewed while songs were sung on behalf of men and women bears. During the rite, everyone used the left hand. The culmination of the rite was an offering of pipestems buried in honor of the bears, who then judged the sincerity of the person making each gift and accordingly benefited, harmed, or killed the individual. From this we can judge that the supernatural power of bears was such that they could and did influence the life and death of humans. This is in keeping with their position as mediators between such vital categories as life/death, woman/man, human/supernatural, and so forth. Interestingly, the chartering myth for this rite involves a young boy who lived for two years with a bear mother and her cubs. After his return, he instituted the rite based on his observations of this bear woman. This association of bears with the</page><page sequence="8">PEOPLE, BERDACHES, AND BEARS 281 Womanly is also implied by the story of a man who angered the bears by saying that the grizzly was his wife and ordering her to come to him immediately. When she did so, the man was greatly frightened and asked forgiveness (Schaeffer 1966:6, 45-47). The Kootenay recognized with special terms both male and female berdaches, although the males were much more numerous. The females acted like Amazons in that they became important war and diplomatic leaders. In the most famous in- stance, a Kootenay woman assumed a full range of male roles in marriage, military, political, and religious areas. She was widely known during the early historic period in the Northwest, until she was killed by the Blackfeet in 1837 for covering the escape of some Flathead during diplomatic negotiations. Based on this and other cases provided by Schaeffer (1965), it appears that such women were physically large, tall, and robust to begin with and matched this size and strength with assertive personalities like those of the manly hearted women best known for the Blackfeet. Once again, the Kootenay provide evidence of the co-occurance of male ber- daches, left-handed bears, and the possibility for individuals to jump gender roles with sufficient provocation. The evidence of Man as the segregated and of Woman as the integrative categories, however, together with the mediation of the berdaches, make the Kootenay consistent with the same pattern among the Keres. A man gained additional dimensions by becoming a berdache, but a woman lost qualities by such a decision, whether personally or supernaturally sanctioned. THE WINNEBAGO The Winnebago played upon this difference in psychological desires and cate- gorical sanctions as revealed by their own ambiguous treatment of berdaches. This society was founded upon a thoroughgoing regard for the opposition between Sky and Earth, formalized in the two moietites of the same names. According to the ori- gin myth, Earthmaker created four worlds, with the sky representing the last man created and the earth the last woman (Radin 1970:329). From this, we can deduce that Man is open and inclusive, while Woman, like the earth, is closed and exclusive. Mediation is represented by Earthmaker himself, a wise and mindful being with the appearance of a man and the creative abilities of a woman. The patrimoieties consisted of twelve named sibs, with four named for birds belonging to the Sky moiety, but with four named for land mammals and another four named for water creatures, in the Earth moiety. Of these twelve, the Thunder- bird sib led those of the Sky, as the Bear led those of the Earth. When the Bear sib held a feast, the members ate with the left hand, out of respect for their eponym (Sapir 1915:7 n. 1; Radin 1970:180, 274). In other situations, the right hand had priority-this use of the left was a peculiarity of bears. Bear clansmen acted as tribal soldiers and police, in addition to holding a special curing dance, given them by bears. Moreover, bears were hunted for food, quested after as guardian spirits, and generally respected by all. Those blessed by a grizzly guardian formed a secret organization, like that of others gifted by a particular spirit (Radin 1970:63, 180, 299). As the Thunderbird sib represented the right, males, and the cosmos, so the Bear represented left, women, and the earth. Data on Winnebago berdaches are sparse because Christian missionaries have taught them to be embarrassed by the subject, at least in public. Nonetheless, Lurie</page><page sequence="9">282 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH (1953) learned that men who had received power from the moon, a female spirit, were obliged to become berdaches, performing tasks appropriate to women in addi- tion to acquiring a special ability for prophecy. These berdaches were respected and highly honored, sometimes marrying a husband. In addition to this supernatural sanction, however, war captives and dishonored Winnebago men were sometimes humiliated by making them assume a female role in lieu of being killed. Women berdaches as such seem to have been unknown. The indications for the Winnebago, therefore, are that while some unfortunate men were forced to assume the female role, the only true berdaches were those who had a supernatural sanction to compen- sate for the loss of their integrative position as men and for assuming the mediating role of the berdache. OTHER EXAMPLES While other data have been sought to expand this comparison to other tribes, only tantalizing hints have been found. While it seems likely that left-handed bears and berdaches were much more common in aboriginal times, there are only the following scattered data to lend support to this. Among Plains tribes, Schaeffer (1966:50 n.19) refers to a Blackfeet myth in which a man with bear power became a bear by having a companion scratch his left foot with a bear claw. Elsewhere, Schaeffer (1965:221) notes the presence of two male berdaches among the Southern Piegan division of the Blackfeet confederation, suggesting that the Blackfeet shared in the pattern found elsewhere with greater documentation. In California, which was formerly populated by several species of grizzly bears now memorialized on the state flag, the Pomo had a class of ruthless shamans called Bear Doctors, widely distributed in other societies of western Native America. Among the Pomo, they would don full bearskin costumes, using the left hand (Barrett 1917: 458ff). While female shamans are well known for the Pomo, there is only a vague reference to berdaches among them (Willoughby 1963:59, Table 6), making this example dubious. A particularly telling case that suggests that belief in left-handed bears was very widespread relates to the Midewiwin, or Shamanic Academy, reformulated about 1700 by the Ojibwa and diffused to other Great Lakes tribes. According to its origin myth, deities instructed Bear (or sometimes Otter, in other versions) to institute the cult among the Ojibwa by training a man named Cutfoot in the lore and ritual. While none of the sources specifies that Bear was left-handed, some of the birchbark mnemonic scrolls used in cult training and the memorizing of the details of myth, ritual, and song, indicate an importance to the left hand. Although many of the figures in the scrolls are armless, Dewdney (1975:95) shows a master scroll from Ontario and a copy of it from Minnesota with twenty-four deities (manito), each holding a pouch insignia in the left hand; Landes (1968:82) repro- duces a scroll with many armless figures and four others holding rattles in the left hand. This use of the left is clearly related to the general respect shown to bears in America. One Mide (Midewiwin) master went so far as to say "the Bear is the strongest animal, so it came to represent God. A bear can do anything" (Dewdney</page><page sequence="10">PEOPLE, BERDACHES, AND BEARS 283 1975:25). Once initiated, the members, or Mide priests, were believed to become actual deities and to take on the qualities of Bear. The more selfish and dangerous ones were sometimes accused of wandering at night, dressed in bearskins, to harm people or get revenge (Landes 1968:63). This association of bears with the left and the Mide does not, however, mean that they had priority. In one origin myth, the Underwater Panther created Man in his right hand and Woman in his left, giving females an inferior, if more flexible position. The implication, by no means substantiated by the data, is that the right hand was associated with chiefs, while the left one was emphasized by Mide shamans. The link between left and Midewiwin was quite strong even when diffused, since among the Omaha, where the Mide was called the Shell (Cowry) Society and the white swan was a patron, "the down near the left wing should be worn on the head. The left wing of the bird would be a symbol of its power" (Fletcher and La Flesche 1972:514). THE DELAWARE: A NEGATIVE EXAMPLE Lastly we turn to a consideration of data from the Delaware of the Northeast, where the berdache role appears to have been singularly absent. Repeated question- ing among modern Delaware has convinced me that there is no evidence for a formalized berdache role in this culture. The nearest equivalent is the term malxkwe, used to refer to a womanish, whiney man, but only in terms of personality charac- teristics, not social role. For the Delaware, Man was inclusive and Woman exclusive, with mediation supplied by a concept of mind-memory (Miller 1979). Priority shifted to the left, under much the same influences and reactions as those behind the Mide. Here the stimulus was a mid-1700 reformist movement called the Big House Cult, which codified traditional culture so that it could better withstand Christianity with its emphasis on the right hand of God. In addition, the Delaware had an elabor- ate Bear Rite and several other bear observances, which indicate that bears held important roles in the cosmology (Wallace 1949; Tantaquidgeon 1972; Speck 1937). Unfortunately, there is no evidence as to which paw might have been given priority in this belief system. From what data do exist, however, we can surmise that bears probably were considered left-handed, because the left hand was used in all rituals. Bears did serve as mediators, with their humanity, strength, herbal lore, and supernatural powers expressed in the Delaware practice of calling them "grandparent" or specifically addressing them as "grandfather" or "grandmother" if the sex were known. This kin term served to emphasize the attitude toward bears as old, wise, and respected. The lack of berdaches among the Delaware, and by extension the culturally very similar Iroquois, seems to derive from two features of the culture. First, the definitions of concentricity made it unlikely that men would assume a woman- like, berdache role and lose their wider attributes of inclusivity. Second, both Delaware and Iroquois women had extremely high social status as compared to women elsewhere in Native America, because their identification with the earth included extensive farming and reliable food surpluses. Unlike the Keres, where Woman is inclusive and the clans are matrilineal, with both male and female mem- bers, the Delaware exclusive Woman suggests that their clans were matrilineal,</page><page sequence="11">284 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH because blood (hmukw) as a Womanly substance was closely circumscribed and the subject of special concern during the transmission of cultural continuity. Delaware women played important roles in the less public negotiations and in matters of home and kinship, while men managed the public and external aspects of the society and had considerable freedom to travel long and far. In this context of greater personal fulfillment, the lack of a berdache role or of any supernatural justification for it seems to be particularly revealing of the psychodynamics behind the berdache posi- tion. Of the tribes cited above, only the Keres and Delaware practiced extensive farming, but among the Keres the men tilled the fields. The Nootka, Kootenay, and Winnebago had foraging economies with local specialities-whales for the Nootka, bison for the Kootenay, and wild rice for the Winnebago. These economies were clearly expressed in the degree of complimentarity between the sexes and the cate- gorical genders, but they by no means explain the gender definitions within these cultures. At best they are merely congruent with the conceptual logic and inter- tribal relations that provide the molding influences for a culture. CONCLUSION It remains for us to assess the overall significance of left-handed bears in the cultures of Native America. In his classic study of circumpolar bear ceremonialism, Hallowell (1926:67, 73 n. 292, 77) specifically discounted from consideration the bear rites of the Delaware, Kootenay, and Ute, as radically different from the hunting observances that were the focus of his comparisons. In doing so he missed the most important feature of bear ceremonialism. In trying to explain why slain bears were welcomed into a home and given special treatment, he went through three possible theories. The economic one held that the propitiation was proportional to the usefulness of bears, but this proved inappropriate when it became clear that bears were economically important in an area larger than that where the ritual was ob- served. The psychological theory held that bears were so humanoid that their killing would cause some regret, if not guilt, and call for some ritual of propitiation. Here again, however, bears occur in a wider area than that of the ritual, so this supposed regret was not universal. Even within the area of the ritual, regard for bears varied greatly, from slight regard to serious reverence. Lastly, the historic-geographical theory held that the observances began in the Paleolithic, as seen by caches of cave bear skulls in Neanderthal sites, and has been gradually diffusing since that time throughout the northern hemisphere, from Scandinavia through arctic America. This theory accounts well for the facts, but only because it is post hoc. Bear ceremonialism is part of a larger complex of hunting rituals emphasizing respect for animals so that their immortal souls will continue to be reborn and supply humans with protein. Often, the animal that is the focus of such rites is the staple in that habitat, either as the primary food and/or a dominant species. The First Salmon Ceremony of the Northwest, Deer Greeting of the Southwest, Bear Cere- monialism of the boreal forest, First Roots and Seeds of the Intermontane, and Acorn Rites of Native California are therefore all aspects of this same complex. Ignored by Hallowell, the Bear Rites of the Delaware and Kootenay are really an intensification of this respect for animals, but involve bears because of the cul-</page><page sequence="12">PEOPLE, BERDACHES, AND BEARS 285 tural role that bears play as mediators in many cultures. Bear spouses and child adoptions that are the subjects of myth are another aspect of such intensification. Bears are people in the same sense that other species are people. They are anthropomorphic under their species robes, exist in complementary genders, and conduct themselves in a moral fashion through language, etiquette, and ritual. Yet bears are also left-handed in the cultures considered above, and probably in many others. While the Keres, Delaware, and Midewiwin members do have left priority, data strongly suggest a universal right priority for humans, except in cases of delib- erate reversal, having to do with asserting a distinct identity, as among Big House adherents. This universal right priority has been linked to male dominance, so that left is associated with females (Needham 1973). From the available evidence, therefore, it seems that bears are left-handed be- cause they are in some sense like women, in addition to being strong and terrifying like men; they are mediators because they share in both of these attributes. To grasp the sense in which bears are women, we milst turn to the important article by Ortner (1974) where she follows Livi-Strauss in arguing for a cross-cultural recognition of the supreme importance of the opposition between culture and nature for all humans. In structuralist theory, culture is the predictable, humanly instituted, and exclusive; nature is unpredictable, awesome, beyond human, and inclusive. In other words, culture is part of nature because it is the biological adapta- tion of humans. The mediator between culture and nature is the concept of Mind, represented both by the physiological brain and by culturally appropriate thoughts. Allowing for variation among individual cultures, as a general rule Man and right are closer to the pole of culture, especially in its public aspects, while Woman and left are closer to that of nature, since females menstruate with the lunar cycle and are more closely associated with such natural acts as birth, eating, and child sociali- zation. Left-handed bears would also be closer to the nature pole, allowing for their equally male attributes of ferocity. To understand their role as mediators, we need to recall the observation of Cassirer (1944:82-83) that many cultures recognize in totemism and other beliefs about animals that there is a solidarity in the society of life, linking all living things together and centering them on the human model. It is in this sense, then, that all of these living species are recognized as various types of people, having ethical, tribal communities and genders like those of humans. Some of these species, however, provide particularly potent symbols for the in- terrelationships within the overall solidarity. Bears are but one example of such symbolic markers serving as halfway stations, or mediators, along the culture/nature continuum. The most widespread of these markers, based on mythology collections and my own Delaware, Salishan, and Tsimshian fieldwork, are dogs, mice, and bears. Dogs are nearer to culture, mediating between humans and other people as the only fully domesticated animal in North America. Mice are midway along the continuum, mediating between the inside and outside of the house and community, so that a mouse is often a polyglot in myths, translating for several groups involved in an activity. Bears are nearer to nature, mediating between the animal peoples. It is extremely interesting that the Tsimshian have maintained prayers to an earlier deity called gol ("unknown, empty, void") only in rituals following the killing of a bear. Otherwise, they have become thoroughgoing Christians and have</page><page sequence="13">286 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH rejected most of their older beliefs. Nature has sometimes been characterized as chaos, but this Tsimshian example suggests that there is only the void of space. The cosmos in such cases seems to be viewed as a bubble floating in the emptiness that is nature in its purest form. In this context then, the Tsimshian appear to have preserved the use of the bear in a mediating role as a safeguard against the void, with Christianity serving to maintain the internal structure of the known world. As with women, it may be the case that natural propensities in bears encourage this association with the left and mediation toward the pole of nature. Biologists have confirmed that polar bears really are left-paw dominant (May et al. 1980:25) and Fraser River Salish insist that when bears leave hibernation they hug the right side of the cave wall, leaving their left arm free for defense (Brent Galloway, personal communication). Yet these observations would only remain biological facts helpful to hunters were they not significant in a wider context, namely the span between nature and culture. As the most humanlike of the Animal People, bears are ap- propriate representatives for one extreme of mediation. They provide food and coverings to people, but are even better symbols for bridging the genders. As Tanner (1979) and Skinner (1914) make clear, after it was killed a bear was butchered and prepared so that the upper torso went to men and the lower body to women, all of which reinforces the argument that bears are inclosive mediators. Similarly, berdaches are regarded by many Amerind cultures as part of the acceptable variation in the society of life. As some individuals are able to switch gender and reverse tasks or identity, so others can seek a compromise position that places them between genders and enables them to tap supernatural reserves of power or energy by virtue of this mediating status. Except where whites have made the subject taboo or embarrassing, berdaches had high status because they functioned like other markers along the culture/nature sequence. Hunting tribes were also astute enough observers during butchering activities to notice that other Animal People had hermaphroditic members, and often equated these with the berdaches, providing a larger status, ambiguous or not, in the society of life. We began by inquiring into the curious references to "people" of many different species, of berdaches, and of left-handed bears. By now we have hopefully arrived at a recognition of all of these as within the culturally acceptable range of biological variation, differing in terms of their inclosive (mediating), inclusive, and exclusive concentric attributes, but, ultimately, all members in the fellowship of life. In terms of this larger context of mediation, bears and berdaches occupy positions at the extremes of the cuture/nature continuum, as can be expressed in this series: CULTURE berdache dog mouse bear NATURE These mediators provide a three-dimensional framework for the flatter relation- ships between the inclusive and the exclusive, usually represented by the metaphors of men-right/women-left in the overall scheme of cultural life.
