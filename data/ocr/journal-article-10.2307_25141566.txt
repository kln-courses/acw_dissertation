<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART IN TWO PARTS THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR JUNE, 1949 NUMBER SIX: PART TWO REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1948 WILLIAM M. MILLIKEN, Director The year I948 broke all records in attendance, the count of 600,744 people exceeding by 171,711 the total of those who passed through the turnstiles last year. Certainly the attend ance of 151,240 during the period of the "Masterpieces from the Berlin Museums" swelled the total materially, but of this figure a large proportion were regular visitors, so that even without these special crowds, the increase would have been nearly 00,00oo. Furthermore, the attendance showed a steady growth which continued through the entire year. It is a most gratifying proof of the place the Museum holds in the affections of the community as a center for recreation and education. The year has been saddened by the death of two members of the Advisory Council, Alwin C. Ernst and Mrs. S. Prentiss Baldwin, and by that of Henry W. Kent, adviser to the Trustees during the building of the Museum. Mrs. Baldwin remembered the Museum most generously in her will; Mr. Kent left instructions that certain objects cherished by him should come to Cleveland. Two individual Membership En dowments, the James D. and Cornelia A. Ireland Fund and the Severance A. and Marta A. Millikin Fund, were established, as well as three contributing Membership Endowments-the Whitney Warner Memorial, the Alfred M. Bonhard Memorial, and the Arthur D. and Marion W. Brooks Funds. There are now 53 Membership, and 18 Contributing, Endowment Funds. Another gift set up during the year was the Harold T. Clark Educational Extension Fund of $So,ooo.oo. The sum of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars was given by four donors towards the Building Fund, the total of which is now $479,699.35. The need for building is evident, and it is encourag ing that so much money has already been set aside for a future addition. Mr. Mather in his Letter of Transmission, however, stresses the immediate need for unrestricted endowment. With III</page><page sequence="2">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART funds today inadequate for current expenses, how much greater will the need be if a new building is constructed. The plenitude of funds for purchase only makes the Museum's responsibility for their safe-keeping and preservation increasingly greater. The publication program of the Museum has had remarkable results. Not only has it had a wide publicity value but the distribution to nearly 400 institutions in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, of the catalogues of the Masterpieces from the Berlin Museums, of The Art of Lithography, and of the Work by Vincent Van Gogh, has brought back a rich return of in valuable exchange material. The Museum's masterpieces are being sought increasingly for reproduction in standard books of reference. The Museum published the catalogue of the Masterpieces from the Berlin Museums for eight other muse ums besides itself in several editions. The astonishing number of 159,000 copies was printed and sold, certainly some kind of a record for an exhibition catalogue. The Junior Council was important for its work in interesting a widening circle of younger people. Its members have served as volunteers; with the Cleveland News they have sponsored the Christmas Community Candlelight Program, one of the unfor gettably beautiful occasions in Cleveland's holiday season. Miss Helen Cole, the Council's Chairman, has been helpful and cooperative in every possible way. The acquisitions for the Painting Department are among the most distinguished in its history. The beautiful "Portrait of a Lady in a Ruff" by Frans Hals ranks with the finest objects in the Museum's collection. It has had a fascinating history, for when in the Alphonse de Rothschild Collection in Vienna, it was taken by Hitler, later hidden in a salt-mine in Austria, given back to the family and sold by them, to enter finally the Cleveland Museum as a purchase from the J. H. Wade Fund. The Spanish primitive, "Coronation of the Virgin," attributed to Pedro Nicolau-de-Albentosa, although given by Hanna Fund in I947, was not shown or published until I948, so it should be included here. It is a tempera of the highest quality, in quite an exceptional state of preservation, and ranks only with the finest Spanish paintings of the early fifteenth century. A group of eight canvases of the French eighteenth century, given by the Louis Dudley Beaumont Foundation, greatly 112</page><page sequence="3">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR enriches the Museum, representing as it does the work of three of the leading painters of that century. There are five wall panels by Lancret, a portrait by Jean-Marc Nattier, and two most important and engaging paintings by Frangois Boucher. These paintings, originally in Commodore Beaumont's Villa Eilenroc on the French Riviera, were evacuated and managed miraculously to keep just one step ahead of the German Occu pation, being finally spirited away to a safe hiding place from the docks at Bordeaux. Added to the Watteau from Potsdam, given during Commodore Beaumont's lifetime, they form a rich ensemble which adds much to the splendid furniture, tapestries, and other works of art of this period in the Museum collection. A fine Puvis de Chavannes, "Autumn," was presented by William G. Mather. Three paintings, a J. C. Ibbetson, a Dutch scene, and a canvas by Bryson Burroughs, were bequeathed by Henry W. Kent. Mrs. B. P. Bole presented a pastel, "Ceres and Bacchus" by Bartholomeus Spranger, a sketch for the oil painting by the same artist in the Holden Collection. A water color by Rowland Suddaby was a gift from Mrs. Malcolm L. McBride. In the realm of American painting a fine John Marin and a James N. Rosenberg were acquired through the Hinman B. Hurlbut Fund. Miss Ettie Stettheimer gave the amusing "Sunday Afternoon in the Country" by Florine Stettheimer, her sister; and the "St. Clair Fire" by Carl F. Gaertner, considered by many to be the artist's finest painting, was given by H. Fred Gaertner in memory of his wife, Nellie Gaertner. Works by William Grauer, Roger Anliker, Dean Ellis, Wray Manning, Richard Gosminski, all Cleveland artists, were happily acquired through different sources. The Department of Prints and Drawings had a remarkable year. Of primary importance were four prints by the Master E.S., which would add stature to any Print Department. The two acquired from the John L. Severance Fund were formerly in the collection of Friedrich August II, King of Saxony. Only eight impressions of these subjects, "The Madonna Enthroned with Eight Angels" and "The Madonna and Child in a Garden" (The Little Hortus Conclusus), are known. The other two from the Grace Rainey Rogers Fund are equally remarkable, there being only five impressions known of "Samson Rending the II3</page><page sequence="4">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART Lion" and eight of "St. Michael." In addition to their rarity, the brilliance of the impressions makes them even more wel come. When the acquisitions from the Dudley P. Allen Fund are added to this group, the record is truly impressive. The latter include the rare "Shepherds in a Landscape" by Giulio and Domenico Campagnola, a magnificent impression; the Jean Duvet, "St. John on the Island of Patmos"; two engravings by the Master M.Z., one from the Waldburg Wolfegg Collection; "The Crucifixion" by Hans Brosamer; two woodcuts by Lucas Cranach and Albrecht Diirer, respectively; the etching, "Por trait of Dr. Gachet by Van Gogh"; and a group of prints by German Expressionists. Three drawings were secured for the John L. Severance Collection: a rare Albrecht Altdorfer; an Alessandro Magnasco; and one by the contemporary artist, Reginald Marsh. Two additional sketches by Boardman Robinson and Yasuo Kuniyoshi were Hinman B. Hurlbut accessions. The published sets of lithographs so characteristic of con temporary French art have not hitherto been represented, and through Hanna Fund the Museum was fortunate enough to acquire the Paris set by Pierre Bonnard and "Four Tales from the Arabian Nights" by Marc Chagall. The Print Club, always generous, presented fifty-seven items, which include the preparatory drawings and impressions for the last two Print Club publications, by Reginald Marsh and Stevan Dohanos, respectively. Further additions by The Print Club ranged from the woodcut by Lucas Cranach from the Friedrich August II Collection, an etching by Van de Velde, mezzotints by Earlom, a drypoint by Rodin, and a lithograph by Toulouse-Lautrec, to drawings by American artists such as Gifford Beal, George (Pop) Hart, John Sloan, and Mahonri Young. As usual, a group of Cleveland prints was secured from the May Show. Print Club members added many items. Chief among these were etchings from Mrs. Ralph King; lithographs for the Mr. and Mrs. Lewis B. Williams Collection; a diversified group of American, British, and Mexican prints from Mrs. Malcolm L. McBride; three items for the Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Prasse Collection; and gifts from Mr. and Mrs. William S. Kinney, Harold M. Hahn, and Mrs. Donald Gray. Other accessions 114</page><page sequence="5">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR came from William G. Mather, Charles D. Childs, Price A. Chamberlin, David Little, Emma G. Brassington. The Department of Decorative Arts concentrated its efforts this year in certain fields. Of primary importance were a gold clasp from the time of the Folkwandering and four Byzantine objects; all of them, shown in the "Exhibition of Gold" and coming from the dispersal of the great collection of Joseph Brummer, were acquired through the Grace Rainey Rogers Fund. Among the Byzantine objects, a silver cross with golden plaques of cloisonne enamel was especially important. A translucent gold and enamel hat jewel, French, sixteenth cen tury, was a John L. Severance Fund purchase. Three fine bronzes and a plaquette round out the exceptional group of small sculptures and plaques that have been added in recent years. Two of these sculptures, the "Pomona" and the Door Knocker by Riccio, were the gracious gift of Mr. and Mrs. Severance A. Millikin, and the others, a North Italian figure and the Ludwig Krug plaquette, were purchases from the John L. Severance Fund. A wood sculpture attributed to Simon Lainberger, German, fifteenth century, was added to the Mary Spedding Milliken Memorial Collection. A "Head of Balzac" by Auguste Rodin was presented by Mrs. Franklyn B. Sanders in memory of Franklyn Brownell Sanders. Another group secured by gift and purchase was the five remarkable pieces of German enameled glass of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, formerly in the Alphonse de Roths child Collection in Vienna, taken by the German Reich during the War, then returned, and recently sold by the family. Three were given by Mrs. Henry White Cannon; two were secured from the John L. Severance Fund. William G. Mather also added glass, by gift, but in the realm of stained glass; five panels supplement the Museum's collection in this field materially. In the section of ceramics, a series of gifts enriched the collec tion. Quite remarkable was the "Italian Comedy Figure: Pantalone," the gift of Rosenberg &amp; Stiebel, Inc. In another field, hitherto practically unrepresented, R. Thornton Wilson added a salt-glaze Staffordshire plate in memory of his wife, Florence Ellsworth Wilson. Mrs. S. Prentiss Baldwin's gift on her ninety-sixth birthday was a group of two cups and saucers, and six lusterware pitchers, also particularly welcome. A modern example marked Chelsea, by Charles Vyse, was given II5</page><page sequence="6">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART for the Mary Spedding Milliken Memorial Collection. Several pieces of Cleveland ceramics and enamel from the May Show were bought for the same memorial. The Rorimer-Brooks Anniversary Award, the George J. Huth Purchase Prize, and the Silver Jubilee Purchase Fund made possible other significant acquisitions of Cleveland work. A major group of objects was secured for the Pre-Columbian Collection. Miss Helen Humphreys, a most generous and con sistent donor to this section, presented six pieces for the memorial collection to her father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Humphreys. These objects originate for the most part in Mexico, but also include an opal dog from Cocle in the Isthmus of Panama as well as a beautiful necklace of humming birds, Colombian, the work of the Quimbaya Indians. To an early period in Mexico, the first Mayan Empire, date the earplugs fashioned most delicately from shell, and of comparable date is the recumbent anthropomorphic figure which came from the region around Vera Cruz. Later pieces in the centuries just before the Spanish Conquest are the Mixtec jade from Oaxaco and the beautiful Aztec piece from the Valley of Mexico. From another source, the John L. Severance Fund, come two wonder ful jades from Monte Alban, products of the first and second periods of that culture, and a seated jade figure, Olmec, of a similar date. The brilliant acquisitions in this field include Mrs. A. S. Ingalls's gift of a stone head in the mouth of a snake, of the Aztec Period. Mrs. R. Henry Norweb, a great friend of this department, loaned a gold Ecuadorian mask. A Paracas bowl, Peruvian, a gift of John Wise, brings the record of things in this sphere to an end. The greater numbers of the jades and stones at one time formed part of the distinguished collection of Joseph Brummer. In the Department of Far Eastern Art, the all-important acquisition, through the J. H. Wade Fund, was a group of twenty-five pieces of Chinese pottery from the private collec tion of Dikran G. Kelekian. They represent examples of the Han, T'ang, Sung, and Yuan Dynasties. A fine Ming painting came also from the same fund. The only other purchase, through the John L. Severance Fund, was a sculpture of the ninth century, from Java, an example from Prambanam, one of the two most important sites in that island. A most exceptional gift Ii6</page><page sequence="7">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR was the Tz'u-chou vase presented by William G. Mather, who also gave seven fine Japanese screens. Other gifts came from James Kitchen, Mrs. C. S. Hoover, and Mrs. Eleanor Wingate Todd. The Near Eastern Department recorded a bronze incense burner, Persian, Seljuk, and a bronze bird of similar provenance. They came respectively from the John L. Sever ance and Edward L. Whittemore Funds. It is very sad to record the resignation of Howard C. Hollis, on January I, I949. Mr. Hollis had been the Curator of these departments for nineteen years. Under his brilliant guidance and through his sureness of taste, collections of real importance and rare distinction were built up. He left with the keen regret of all who have worked with him, and the Museum will always be grateful for the creative part he has taken in its development. The Textile Department made numerous purchases during the year, which fell into well-defined groups. All the purchases, unless otherwise noted, were from the J. H. Wade Fund. Among them was a series of Chinese embroideries. Mrs. J. M. Irwin also presented a Mandarin coat. Other embroideries acquired were four rare Coptic pieces of the sixth and seventh centuries. A tapestry roundel of the same general origin was also included in the year's acquisitions. Other pieces were a rare Chinese textile of the fourteenth century and Spanish, Italian, and Persian silks of the thirteenth century. Very excep tional was the panel of silk velvet, Persian, sixteenth century, which at one time formed part of the decoration of a tent. The single most remarkable addition was an amazing thirteenth century embroidered altarpiece, German, which came from the same source as a similar piece in the Metropolitan Museum. Modern textiles featuring museum influences, and other signif icant examples of contemporary design included in exhibitions held in conjunction with local department stores, were acquired in part by purchase, and in part as generous gifts from the makers and from the Halle Bros. Co. Other donors to the department included Joseph F. Sindelar and Nasli Heera maneck. In the Classical Department no purchases were made, but a gold chain and pendant, Roman, second century A.D., incorpor ating elements of Hellenistic Greek origin, was given most graciously by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mallon. In the Egyptian I17</page><page sequence="8">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART Department, however, two major acquisitions greatly strength ened that section. One, a late Fifth Dynasty limestone statuette of Min-nefer, was a J. H. Wade Fund purchase; it came from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, who disposed of certain pieces "acquired by excavation in excess of what it can exhibit." Theother, a gift ofHanna Fund, is also in the round, the torso of a priest, Ptolemaic Period. It has been called by the leading experts in this country "the best royal work of the end of the dynastic period ... an outstanding example of the last gasp ... of Egyptian sculptural art." A series of quite exceptional exhibitions marked the year. The season, starting with the "Twelfth National Exhibition of Contemporary American Ceramics," flashed then into the brilliant "Pierre Bonnard Memorial Exhibition," jointly spon sored by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and The Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland's share in the project being graciously appropriated, and presented to the Museum, by Hanna Fund. A truly extraordinary exposition of a man's genius, this was the greatest showing of Bonnard's work ever held. The "Thirtieth Annual Exhibition of Work by Cleveland Artists and Craftsmen," the May Show, achieved the greatest total for sales in the three decades of its existence. In the fall, the "Masterpieces from the Berlin Museums" broke all records for attendance and interest. Again, Hanna Fund most generous ly underwrote the large expenses for this exhibition. Following this, three showings were held conjointly: "Wedgwood-A Living Tradition"; the great exhibition of "Work by Vincent Van Gogh"; and "The Art of Lithography, Sesquicentennial Exhibition," the largest and most comprehensive exhibition of its kind, composed of prints owned by one museum. The Van Gogh show was arranged in honor of "Les Paveurs," the great picture given by Hanna Fund in I947, and the exhibition itself was made possible through the same source. A most unique exhibition of "Modern Wallpaper," sponsored by Katzenbach and Warren, Inc., closed the year with great success. Smaller exhibitions of significance in the Print Gallery were the "Work of Reginald Marsh and Stevan Dohanos," and the photographs, "Social Life of the I88o's." The new gifts, the French eight eenth-century paintings from the Louis Dudley Beaumont Foundation, were featured at various times. 118</page><page sequence="9">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR The Department of Musical Arts proved by its record that it is one of the most popular of the Museum's activities. Many times the concerts given drew capacity audiences and the last concerts of the Andre Marchal series in January brought as well many listeners from out-of-town to pay a well-deserved tribute to the genius of this great French organist. The McMyler Memorial Fund continues to give basic and all-important sup port to the department. The smaller yield from that endowment has been insufficient for the complete program, so that only the creative help of the Musart Society and the generosity of its members has made the fuller plans possible. A special event of the year was the third Good Friday program of the "St. Matthew Passion" by Bach. Among the events scheduled were such distinguished programs as the first American performances of quartets by Ralph Vaughn Williams and William Walton, played by the Walden String Quartet; concerts by Joseph Knitzer and Arthur Loesser, covering the development of the sonata for violin and piano; a brilliant and exciting program by Oscar Shumsky, made possible by a special gift. The impressive and moving Christmas Carol Program was presented with the aid of the Wa-Li-Ro Boy Choir Association, under the direction of Paul Allen Beymer, and the Epworth-Euclid Church Choir, directed by Elwin Haskin. The Sunday afternoon organ con certs by the Curator do a remarkable job in acquainting an increasing public with the major works of organ music. The same program is repeated each Sunday throughout the month, a procedure which gives a rare opportunity to the many inter ested to familiarize themselves with organ masterpieces. As special lecturer at Case Institute of Technology, the Curator continued the popular classes in music appreciation. The Educational Department had a busy and most profitable year. The all-important special exhibitions of the year placed an extra load on the personnel, but they acquitted themselves of this burden in splendid fashion. Only the limited size of the regular staff prevented much larger statistics for the work with the elementary schools of Cleveland and the suburbs. The demand there is insatiable, and the Cleveland Public School staff has been unable to satisfy even a part of the calls made upon them-another teacher there is much needed, while the Museum staff is quite inadequate to take care of the requests II9</page><page sequence="10">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART from the suburbs. The part of the Museum's work with the schools in Cleveland is extraordinarily well and closely inte grated with their programs. This coordination of effort is due to the wisdom of the Superintendent of Schools, Mark C, Schinnerer, and is reflected throughout his staff. Alfred Howell, Directing Supervisor, Mrs. Grace Z. Langebrake and Bertha K. Budde, Assistant Supervisors, have given the three teachers assigned to the Museum, Ann V. Horton, Ronald Day, and Clarke H. Garnsey, the latter substituting for Dana E. Church, their steady support. It is a cooperating program which works because there has never been a question of its not working. It is a model that is the admiration of, and the dream sought by, many other cities. The Cleveland Heights Schools and the Shaker Heights Schools have the same close relation with the Museum. Many of their supervisors have worked long years with the Museum, and many of their teachers have been a part of the Museum staff. This condition brings essential familiarity and sympathy. The Museum becomes an understood and primary part of their program. Other suburban schools use the Museum's facilities fully, and a planned schedule of school buses has increased that service materially in the past year. The Catholic School System brings classes to the Museum through the energy and enthusi asm of individual teachers. The Museum would welcome a larger use of its facilities by these schools and the possible appointment of special teachers who could integrate their program more closely with the Museum materials. The Saturday morning classes bring to the Museum each week through eight months of the year a large group of children; these classes are for members' children, as well as for a group of specially talented children who are chosen through careful selection. In addition, there is a large number in a free class open to any child who cares to come. This free class continues also through the summer. The teaching staff has been faithful and loyal through many years, and the continuity of personnel, the flexibility and varied character of the approach, keep alive the creative freshness which is essential; it does not become a fixed and crystallized program. The class for specially talented children has been financed, in part, as in the past, by the S. D. and MayWise Charitable Trust oftheJewish Welfare Federation. 120</page><page sequence="11">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR The Summer Outdoor Classes have become a fixture, and one of the most sought-after services of the Museum. Financed by the income from the L. E. Holden Fund, they carry out the purpose of the donor, in interesting children in outdoor art. The classes in the Fine Arts Garden and Wade Park have an incomparable setting in which to work. So popular have they become, that it has been necessary to restrict them to a specified number. The Museum tries to maintain at all times its touch with related fields, and in the Moving Picture Section, an emphasis has been put on art films and on films which are important in the development of the technique of the medium. Modern and old films of exceptional quality are shown in special programs. The Museum is being used as a laboratory by the institutions of higher learning in Cleveland. That is as it should be. Western Reserve University, through its new program of appreciation, uses the Museum increasingly, and Case Institute of Technol ogy has added similar courses to its curriculum. The Curator of Education, as Professor of Art in the University, is a special means of liaison between the organizations, teaching four classes on a graduate level. Mrs. Margaret Marcus also gives courses, in Flora Stone Mather College. The Museum carries its extension collections to the schools, libraries, settlement houses, and colleges. There is close correla tion between exhibitions and special teaching on determined subjects, and there is an integration of all efforts, often imple mented with loans of slides and reproductions, features which make the work of this department a most productive and useful service. The Exhibition of the Month, highlighting some particular theme, has been most cleverly carried on by George Culler, and Mrs. Ruth Ruggles has brought a series of instructive and interesting small exhibitions to the Educational Corridor. Classes have also been held on the adult level. They are never thought of from the vocational standpoint, which is the duty of the Cleveland Institute of Art and similar organizations. They are planned, instead, on the basis of the development of appreciation. Club groups have in some cases carried through carefully chosen programs planned over a long-range pattern. Dr. Thomas Munro, as Editor of The Journal of Aesthetics 121</page><page sequence="12">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART and Art Criticism, has associated the Museum with an impor tant periodical which has an international circulation and provides a publication for scholars throughout the world in its chosen field. The Library suffers, as does so much of the Museum, from severely cramped space. It has been most efficiently adminis tered, however, within these limitations. It is a reference library and must keep pace with the special provinces in which the Museum's collections are developing. It now consists of 23,879 volumes. It must have basic publications, which are often rare and costly; therefore, the buying program must be most carefully and intelligently thought out, for the library administration is faced with the double problem of funds and of where to put the necessary books when they are acquired. In addition to the book collection for reference, there are the lending collections divided into three divisions: lantern slides, photographs in black and white, and color reproductions. The lantern slides are much sought after, as is indicated by the number lent, 204,868 from a collection numbering 53,04I pieces. A large number of color slides are among the new accessions. They overcrowd the available space, as do also the photograph lending and reference sections, so that it needs to be greatly expanded to take care of the material required to fill the constant calls. The Department of Publicity had a banner year. The clever ness and ingenuity used in the placing of data on the Museum and its collections in newspapers, magazines, and house organs have paid off in greatly increased attendance. Much goodwill has been created, and the Museum has been kept constantly before the eyes of the public in its many-faceted appeal. The radio programs have been constant, and they also keep the public aware of the many activities which are here for them to enjoy. The development of television also bids fair to be a most important adjunct to the means of popularizing the Museum's programs. The Photograph Department furnishes the post cards and reproductions sold at the Sales Desk. It makes both the record photographs of all materials in the Museum and the excellent lantern slides in black and white and color which are being constantly added to the lending collection. 122</page><page sequence="13">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR The Tea Room takes care of an increasing public. The excellence of its cuisine, the courtesy of its service, have made it a popular place. It serves the public as well as the Museum staff, and because of the Museum's position in the park, away from other restaurants, it fills a great need. This year has been a busy one in the Department of Building and Grounds. The installation of precipitrons in the ventilation system to eliminate dirt and the preliminary work on air con ditioning of the entire building have entailed an extra amount of work. All the walls of the south flight of galleries were re covered, and a major painting job in those and other galleries has put the Museum in excellent physical condition. The loyal work of a trained and efficient staff has made that possible. Recognition must be made of the staff who have so loyally made the Museum service possible. The retirement of Minnie H. Bredbeck, after thirty-three years of inspired service, is a loss to the Museum, but her standard has made a mark in the Museum which will long affect it. The deaths of John Toker and Edmund McCaffrey, guards, also saddened the year. The Museum is a homogeneous organization, and the faithful and cooperative service of its staff has made it a warm and friendly place, a real power in its community. 123</page><page sequence="14">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART REPORT OF THE TREASURER LETTER OF TRANSMISSION OF FINANCIAL REPORT May I3, 1949 The President and Board of Trustees, The Cleveland Museum of Art.
