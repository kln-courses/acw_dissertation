Paris: Editions Promodis, publie avec le concours du Centre National des Lettres, 1984. 338 pp. illus. Fr. 450.—. (isbn: 2-903181-35-7) Reviewed by Mary-Parke Johnson A recent contribution to the new scholarship in historical children's litera ture is Segolene Le Men's exhaustive analysis of illustrated French ABC books of the nineteenth century. Drawing on the matchless collection of ABC books in the Bibliotheque Nationale and others at the Musee National d'Histoire de l'Education and the Institut National de Recherche et de Documentation Pedagogique, the author has assembled a remarkably accurate picture of the character and con tent of these ubiquitous primers. If her judgments seem harsh—that the ABC books were a completely unoriginal literature, of a derivative and con ventional imagery—they only confirm suspicions that have been formed about English and American texts of the same period, suspicions which will linger until a comparable analysis is attempted for them. The discussion of French ABC books is organized into six chapters under three sections. The first two sections have to do with conditions and educa tional methods, and techniques of instruction; the third deals with the themes of common reading. In the first chapter, entitled "Production et diffusion," the author has distinguished seven types of ABC books. These are gathered into a useful table whose usefulness is vitiated by the publisher's decision to insert a leaf of illustrations between what should have been a double-page spread of tabular material thereby making comparison of the types awkward and time-consuming. Also covered in this chapter are such topics as the anonymity of authors and illustrators, which touches upon the evolution of texts as well as the source of inspiration for their illustration; the importance of the publisher; and diffusion through such means as colportage, booksellers licensed to sell children's books, advertisements in popular journals, and the dissemination of publishers' catalogues. From the production and diffusion of illustrated French ABC books, the author moves to a discussion of how and where they were read. Chapter 2, Mary-Parke Johnson (3 Montvale Road, Worcester, MA 01609) is a consultant in early children's literature and Director of Curatorial Consultants, an exhibition and research service for museums, libraries, and private collectors. pbsa 80:1 (1986), 129-131</page><page sequence="2">130 Bibliographical Society of America "La legon de la lecture," examines the milieux in which the reading lesson took place. Aspects of domestic education with its emphasis on maternal instruction are compared and contrasted with various forms of institutional learning including primary schools whose scholastic traditions date from the fifteenth century. The succeeding chapter, "Ordre et methode," is devoted to pedagogical theories used in domestic and school education and is frankly a bit punish ing in the degree to which they are analysed. It will probably be of most interest to semeiologists. And, too, the author's habit of quoting often and generously from original as well as supporting texts seems particularly intru sive here. However, the reader's attention is redeemed in full by the capti vating illustrations and insightful commentary in chapter 4, "La pedagogie par l'image." In nineteenth-century French ABC books the combination of text (the educative element) and image (the recreative element) found expression in three sorts of illustrated alphabets: those where text and picture form two distinct sequences allied solely by closeness with each other (contiguity), those where each letter has a word illustrated by a picture (semantic alli ance), and those where the letter is actually superimposed upon the picture it is meant to evoke. In this latter category are various forms of illustrated letter including the fantastic figured alphabets, derived in part from popular spectacles like those of the commedia dell'arte, which found their most elo quent expression in the famous anthropomorphic alphabet of Daumier. The remaining two chapters of the book, "Les arts et metiers" and "L'his toire naturelle," explore the themes of common reading. Undoubtedly, French ABC books of the nineteenth century served as conduits for ideas espoused in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by Locke, Rousseau, the Encyclo pedistes, and others which had become married in popular sentiment to the values of the new bourgeoisie. Rousseau's egalitarian principles in particu lar exerted a strong influence on the content of these books so that they be came, in effect, a form of propaganda for the work ethic. The ABC books which have for their theme the arts and trades reflect a decidedly conserva tive point of view wherein the dignity of labor is illustrated by the traditional professions of artisans (e.g., the baker, the vintner, the glassmaker). Inherent in this conservatism was mistrust of industrialization and a contempt for commerce, a contempt which also expressed an underlying anti-Semitism through the stereotypical depiction of money lenders. The author suggests that a great number of the ABC books of arts and trades were destined for future apprentices as a kind of introduction to the trade. While existing evidence is scarcely adequate to confirm this theory it would be a worthwhile notion to pursue through further research.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Those ABC books consecrated to the themes of natural history were for the most part freely adapted from the works of the eighteenth-century natu ralist Georges Buffon. Curiously, the author found only six texts in the course of her research which describe flowers and fruits; all others deal with the natural history of animals. The influence of the exotic, reflected both in the iconography and type of animal depicted, derived from heraldry and from unfamiliar animals such as the giraffe, introduced into France c. 1827. Other animals chosen for illustration were of the traditional variety found in menageries, specifically the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Despite the care with which the material for this book was researched, a number of careless errors mar the text. While it is acknowledged that an author bears responsibility for the accuracy of his work, clearly Madame Le Men was ill-served by her editors. In addition to numerous typographical errors throughout the text, there are instances (pp. 167 and 168) where illustrations are incorrectly keyed to their bibliographical references in the index. On p. 169, an ABC book is dated as the year VI in the text but bears the date II in the footnote. Finally, there are several creative spellings of the name of Newbery, the eighteenth-century English publisher of children's literature—none of them correct. The book is lavishly illustrated in black and white with the addition of four color plates, but many of the illustra tions, like those on pp. 148, 149, and 284 lack crisply defined edges. There is also a good deal of broken type throughout, and the copy received for review bore smudges from press ink on at least one-third of the pages. In short, Les abecedaires frangais illustres du XIXe siecle is a worthy study of an important genre of children's literature, albeit a poorly produced one.</page></plain_text>
