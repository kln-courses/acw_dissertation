[Sidney Dobell], Palladiuml (September 1850). There can be no interest attached to the writer of Wuthering Heights-a novel succeeding Jane Eyre and purporting to be written by Ellis Bell-unless it were for the sake of a more individual reprobation. For though there is a decided family likeness between the two, yet the aspect of the Jane and Rochester animals in their native state, as Catherine and Heathfield [sic], is too odiously and abominably pagan to be palatable even to the most vitiated class of English readers. [Elizabeth Rigby, Lady Eastlake], Quarterly Review (December 1848).1 CONTEMPORARY REVIEWERS RESPOND BOTH MORE AND LESS CONSCIOUSLY than modem critics to what lies between the lines of a novel. The two reviews excerpted above represent extremes, to be sure, of reaction to Wuthering Heights, reactions unmediated by subsequent general opinion or even accurate information about its authorship. The novel remains, to this day, one which students either love or hate and one which critics and scholars find endlessly fascinating. The fact that virtually every ism of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries has been proposed as a candidate for the novel's hidden agenda bears witness to its apparent the- oretical vigor. The above reviews indicate not only extremes of reaction to the novel but also a context more appropriate to its period as well as its I Excerpted in Wuthering Heights: A Casebook, ed.

Both Sidney Dobell and Lady Eastlake recognize that there is something fundamentally theological going on, the obvious difference being that the "baby god" is speaking pagan to Eastlake. She has understood all too well, perhaps even better than many modem critics, that something biological is also going on between the lines. Her vehemence is instructive, for it will be matched, a dozen years later, by the outrage effected by Charles Darwin's Origin of Species (1859). Darwin's notebooks of the late 1830s and 1840s, the period of the Brontes' intellectual maturity, demonstrate that the pieces of the evolu- tionary puzzle had fallen in place decades before the publication of the Origin2. These notebooks and the later autobiography indicate his reticence to proselytize for the "materialism" in which he so firmly believed, despite the fact that he was able to provide "material," biological bases for the moral and even religious instincts in man. As a scientist, he lacked the protection of Emily Bronte's fiercely maintained cover of pseudonymity, not to mention the possibility of narrative indirectness. But he was able to devise, in the years before notoriety, a persona of sorts: that of a harmless, though scru- pulously careful investigator of topsoils and fossils, gentians and flatworms. This somewhat eccentric country gentleman also circulated a number of ingenuous questions to several well-known breeders of domestic animals.3 While always alert to the dangerous unorthodoxy of the theory they are elaborating, Darwin's notebooks often suggest a decided giddiness in the triumph of his materialism over the patently ridiculous explanations provided by natural theology. Having weathered the initial vengeance, Dar- win became increasingly bold to go the distance of his early conclusions, publishing The Descent of Man in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals the following year. It is impossible to know where Emily Bronte might have gone with her own theories after Wuthering Heights or even to define the motives behind her determination to publish the novel, as provocative in its own way as Darwin's theory. It can never- theless be said that, for both of them, truth had been revealed in a nature relatively untampered with by mankind, and that error proceeded from a human refusal to recognize the fundamental connection between humans and animals. These premises brought both Darwin and Bronte to very similar conclusions about human vis-a-vis animal "nature," at much the same time 2 Paul H.

Both were, more or less deliberately, building a case against the prevailing state of British biology and theology, dominated as both were by William Paley's "Argument from Design," and, more or less concomitantly, against the social and psychological complacency that this natural theology had seemed to justify. This paper places Emily Bronte in what seems then her most appropriate context: the transition from the "design" of Paley's natural theology to Darwin's description of the "mech- anism" of natural selection. I argue that Bronte, like Darwin, utterly rejected the anthropocentrism and notions of progress that had served natural the- ologians as both first and final cause; that Bronte, like Darwin, based her conclusions on observation and knowledge of the manipulations of "selec- tion" on the part of animal breeders, as well as on close and relatively objective observation of animal behavior; that Bronte, more aggressively than Darwin, had come to conclusions about the literal descent of Victorian man from his essential animal nature; that Bronte's conclusions, like Dar- win's, grew out of a reverence for the pitiless economy of nature; that Bronte, unlike both Darwin and the natural theologians, was perfectly comfortable with a personal God who operated as ruthlessly as Darwin's "mechanism"; and that-to return this argument to the novel that plays out its proposi- tions-Wuthering Heights represents this "God" of hers, this "mechanism," in the character of Heathcliff. I Virtually all critics of Wuthering Heights have addressed themselves to the rhetoric of animality in the novel, finding in the trope a structural device, a feature of characterization, a clue to Bronte's Renaissance sources, an element of her philosophy of nature, and so on. Few have been as willing as Eastlake to grant animality more than metaphorical status. Those who have seem as unable as Eastlake to extricate themselves from that Great Chain of Being Darwin had aimed to subvert: "brutish," "inhuman," "fe- rocious" are terms we are all assumed to understand as pejoratives. J. Hillis Miller's definition of life at Wuthering Heights as "a return [to an animal state] reached only through the transgression of all human law" exemplifies this position among modern critics, the difference between his reading and Eastlake's lying mainly in his attribution of the moral outrage to the author herself.4 Darwin had been at great pains to reserve terms like "brutish," 4 J.

Bronte and Darwin both seem to have preferred the moral instincts-and even the company- of dogs.6 Evolution had been, as we say, "in the air" since the 1830s, but that atmosphere was created largely by geologists and paleontologists. Little suggests that Emily Bronte had been influenced by that literature: Cath- erine's love for Heathcliff is, after all, "like the eternal rocks beneath" (italics mine).7 Nor is evolution per se (the development of new species over eons) the question or issue for Bronte, whose own sense of natural selection operates over both a shorter (since "1500") and a longer ("eternal") temporal framework. She is concerned only with the moral, social, psychological, and theological implications of natural science. Darwin himself had attempted, in the same years, to distinguish the issues by sorting his speculations and observations into notebooks on "transmutation" and "metaphysics." We do know that both Charlotte and Emily Bronte were avid students of natural history, delighting in such animal lore as the "Dogiana" columns of Cham- bers's Edinburgh Journal.s Similarly anecdotal accounts of animal behavior also fed Darwin's notebooks and speculations. My own evidence suggests that Bronte knew, also, a great deal about the history and practice of sheep- breeding in Yorkshire and that these facts became as crucial to her under- standing of human nature as they had to Darwin's theory of natural selection. Studying Bronte's work in the context of contemporary natural science confirms what had formerly been only an intuitive response to Wuthering Heights: that the novel is a hypothetical experiment in the breeding of human beings, conducted to suggest how the breed has been corrupted from its "native state" by the very civilization that the Lady Eastlakes arbitrate. In a truly "Fresh Approach to Wuthering Heights," Q. D. Leavis first elucidated the line of sociological argument in the novel, a line more 5 Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Rel(tion to Sex (1871; rev. ed., New York: D.

These analyses of the novel's commentary on the social and economic deterioration of a nine- teenth-century rural community leave little more to be said. The importance of such commentary has been clear ever since C. P. Sanger revealed Bronte's knowledge of English property law.9 But all three of these critics readily admit that the social commentary is not what arouses contemplation on the first or even tenth reading of Wuthering Heights. The novel is about far more fundamental, eternal human problems and overwhelms us with its remorseless-if not easily definable-sense of the workings of things. Anyone at all familiar with Emily Bronte's poetry and personality knows that she had no interest whatsoever in "society"-in any sense of the word. She did not go particularly out of her way for people, aside from her own family and servants, and was distant and diffident even with her sisters' friends. "All that I, a stranger, have been able to learn about her," Elizabeth Gaskell remarks, "has not tended to give either me, or my readers, a pleasant impression."10 Though Bronte's poetry reveals a private struggle to reconcile herself to her disappointment in human folly and weakness," she seems never to have altered her social behavior toward those she considered un- justifiably privileged, pampered, weak. An indefatigable worker herself, she clearly respected the industriousness of the working classes. Later biogra- phers, therefore, came away with far better impressions by consulting family servants and local tradesmen, or their descendants. Wuthering Heights itself testifies to the close attention Bronte had paid the working people among whom she grew up, to her fondness for their "plain-speaking" and matter- of-fact vision of the ways of the world and of their supposed "betters." Bronte was schooled by them, and her sense of debt and admiration is, as Leavis suggests, a source for the sociological warp of the novel's fabric. But is it necessary to postulate, as Leavis does, two novels-a "so- ciological" and a "real" Wuthering Heights-going on in tandem? We clearly get two stories for the price of one, the first ending with the simultaneous death of the first heroine and birth of the second, but the distinctions between these two novels are those of decorum and genre rather than subject. The sociology of Wuthering Heights is, furthermore, consistent with its theories of biology, psychology, and theology-a common thread that 9 Q. D.

SUMMER 1984 481</page><page sequence="6">Barbara Munson Goff runs through both novels: Bronte is constructing an "argument from design" that accounts for her vision of both nature and human history, and she is of one mind about both. Dobell's " 'large utterance' of a baby god" far more aptly accounts for our sense of sureness and coherence in the novel's me- taphysics, despite surface confusions of character and time.12 Dictating the words of its numerous inadequate or partial narrators is a consciousness at least as sure of itself and presumptuous as that of Milton "justify[ing] the ways of God to man." Our awareness of this consciousness is literally "me- taphysical," speaking over and above the words that create the characters and events. We know what we know of the novel's truth in much the same way that the "truth" is revealed to a religious visionary, who sees through the apparent surfaces of things. One of the few things that we know about Emily Bronte, from her designatedly personal poems, is that she felt God speaking to her on the moors. That God speaks in the "Book of Nature" as well as in the Bible is the premise upon which natural theology had been based for centuries. It was most definitely the moral of Reverend Bronte's numerous sermons and publications on the Crow Hill Bog Burst of 1824, an event that Emily Bronte had witnessed when she was six.l3 Such sermons were in the brimstone for Romantics, fundamentalists, and Haworth Sunday Schoolers alike. Personal revelation was, however, another matter entirely, one at odds with Anglican orthodoxy. Behind the anonymity of "Ellis Bell," Emily Bronte became as determined as Darwin to present the whole picture of human nature and as driven as an Old Testament prophet to speak the truth, regardless of its effect on an audience for whose moral weaknesses she, like the prophets and her own Joseph, felt little pity. Emily Bronte was not merely shy and reclusive but downright ascetic and misanthropic. Wuthering Heights is animated by her contempt for humanity and its fallen ways. But it also offers salvation for those readers willing to accept the harshness of its vision, for it describes, in terms and forms familiar to its audience from gothic romance, the possibility of a union with the awesome and destructive powers of nature/God that transcends normal experience. Rather than trying to describe such experience directly, as Bronte does in her poetry, Wuthering Heights allows us only to glimpse 12 Dobell's review is, in fact, the one specifically cited by Charlotte Bronte in her "Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell" as having "discerned the real nature of Wuthering Heights." The "Biographical Notice" and "Editor's Preface to the New Edition of Wuthering Heights" of 1850 are reprinted in every moder edition of the novel. All subsequent references to Charlotte Bronte's remarks, unless otherwise noted, are taken from these prefaces and will be indicated in the text. 13 John Lock and W. T.

Nelly Dean, sharing the superstitions of the Yorkshire peasantry, is at least open to "supernatural" experience, though she reduces it to familiar ghosts, demons, and fairies. Bronte presents her own caveat to the reader by having Nelly, the best of her narrators, explain to Lockwood- the most short-sighted and also, I think, Bronte's personal archetype of the reader of novels and "artificial man of cities"-"You'll judge as well as I can, all these things, at least you'll think you will, and that's the same" (chap. 17). The reader's judgment of Wuthering Heights is ultimately a matter of coming to terms with Heathcliff. The more intellectually provocative mod- ern analyses of the novel have, I think, made a poorer showing in this respect than the more romantic, symbolic, or mystical readings that characterized appreciations of the novel in its first hundred years. The worst offender in this regard may be Q. D. Leavis herself, who rebukes those critics for not understanding that "[Heathcliff] is merely a convenience," a plotting device (Leavis, p. 96). The novel's chief interest, for narrators and readers alike, is psycho- logical, as is Leavis's otherwise superb analysis of the characters; she may thus be excused for her technical reduction of Heathcliff. He is not very complicated psychologically and does not "develop" at all. He exits from the novel, leaving its readers and characters in the same state as Mr. Earn- shaw was upon introducing him into the family circle thirty-two years before: "I was never so beaten with anything in my life; but you must e'en take it as a gift of God, though it's as dark almost as if it came from the devil" (chap. 4). I will not elaborate the subsequent identification of Heathcliff with the devil on the part of all the characters-or Charlotte Bronti's more grisly specification, a "Ghoul." More to my point is Nelly's alternative version of ways in which Heathcliff confounds categorization and human inter- course: "I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own species; it appeared that he would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity" (chap. 15). Heathcliff is, if possible, identified as an animal even more frequently than as a demon. Heathcliffs power transcends that of mere humans and, I believe, is the power that Bronte equates with nature, if not God Himself. Again, Eastlake's reading is accurate: Bronte was a pagan in the most wholesome and primal sense of the word, and, as the parson's daughter, was especially vulnerable to suggestions of "devilment." Like William Blake, Bronte used the strategy of simply reversing charges on such words as reason and energy, good and evil, heaven and hell (and also, like Darwin, animal and human). Her au- SUMMER 1984 483</page><page sequence="8">Barbara Munson Goff thoritative absence from the novel allows us, even forces us, to "think we will [have judged]" Heathcliff when, in fact, we have merely confirmed our own presumptions. Salvation has always been a risky theological proposition, but we have never been denied the freedom to go to hell in our own handbaskets. The most distressing reading of Heathcliff as evil, "in- deed ... unredeemed"- distressing because it would seem to validate dec- ades of misunderstanding-is Charlotte Bronte's. In her "Preface" to the 1850 edition of Wuthering Heights, she doubts "whether it is right or ad- visable to create beings like Heathcliff' and attempts to excuse her sister on grounds that she "did not know what she had done," not being "a lady or a gentleman accustomed to what is called 'the world.' " It is difficult to believe that such an intelligence as Charlotte's failed so completely to com- prehend her sister's, or that she really believes that Nelly Dean, good hearted though she may be, is the spiritual center of Wuthering Heights. Reviews such as Eastlake's, however, forced an awareness of the power of her sister's unorthodoxy on her. Having opened the can of worms in the first place, Charlotte must have felt especially obliged to defend her late sisters from snobbish reviewers and their charges of crudeness and blasphemy. It is possible to find, between the lines of Charlotte's introductory essays, yet another assault on a "vitiated class of English readers" (the one to which Lockwood, Eastlake, and most of us belong) to place beside the one mounted by Wuthering Heights itself, Charlotte being relatively adept at the art of sarcasm. Emily Bronte seems to have defied categorization, for even Charlotte is unable-or unwilling-to define her sister's creed for so sympathetic an audience as Charlotte's own editor, W. S. Williams, who had offered the three sisters the opportunity to come to London to see more of "what is called 'the world'": Ellis [Emily Bronte], I imagine, would soon turn aside from the spectacle [of London] in disgust. I do not think he admits it as his creed that 'the proper study of mankind is man-- at least not the artificial man of cities. In some points I consider Ellis somewhat of a theorist: now and then he broaches ideas which strike my sense as more daring and original than practical; his reason may be in advance of mine, but certainly it often travels a different road. I should say Ellis will not be seen in his full strength till he is seen as an essayist.T' The prospect of discourse of more "full strength" than Wuthering Heights begs credulity. I, nonetheless, find this passage Charlotte's truest assessment of her sister's achievement, accurate as well as insightful. Her estimate of her sister's true strength is echoed in the probably independent judgment 14 Charlotte Bronte to W. S. Williams, 15 February 1848, in Clement Shorter, The Brontes: Life and Letters, 2 vols. (1908; rpt. ed., New York: Haskell House, 1969), I, 396-397. VICTORIAN STUDIES 484</page><page sequence="9">BETWEEN NATURAL THEOLOGY AND NATURAL SELECTION of M. Heger, their schoolmaster in Brussels, who told Gaskell that "Emily had a head for logic, and a capability of argument, unusual in a man, and rare indeed in a woman.... Impairing the force of this gift, was her stubborn tenacity of will, which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her sense of right, was concerned" (Gaskell, p. 230). The rectitude of Emily Bronte's "creed"-whatever it was-is emphasized again in the praise of another of the few people who know her personally, Charlotte's friend, Ellen Nussey: "Emily's exteme reserve seemed impenetrable, yet she was intensely lovable; she invited confidence in her moral power."15 None of these testimonials to Bronte's character is able to divorce the toughness of her mind from her passionate intensity. The same may also be said of Wuthering Heights, an emotional experience matched in rawness only by the Lear it so clearly resembles. As with Lear, we are presented with "unaccommodated man," "the thing itself," the "poor, bare, forked animal[s]" mankind becomes when bereft of artificial dominion over animal nature. As with Lear, it is equally difficult to locate an authoritative voice in the work, internal evidence continuously refuting all suggested formulations. Yet we do not come to the conclusion, as we can with Lear, that Wuthering Heights is simply nihilistic. Even Samuel Johnson would have approved of the novel's ending, for the virtuous seem finally to prosper. But what then is its creed, its argument, its moral? I nominate an intuitive, religious version of the theory of natural selection, derived, as Darwin's was, from close observation of nature and a profound respect for its driving forces, the simultaneity of creation and destruction, the laws of conservation of matter and energy. Wuthering Heights shows these driving forces, embodied in Heathcliff, at work over three generations. Adaptation is, indeed, in evidence, but it is adaptation to an environment whose deterioration gathers momentum with the accommo- dations of civilization. Bronte differs from Darwin, however, in a significant respect: try as he might to avoid and deny it, Darwin could not help but suggest that evolution was progressive. Bronte's view is more traditionally orthodox, suggesting, literally, the descent of man, sin originating in our fall from animal nature. "Methodical selection," in man as in animals, has not improved the breed. II Emily, half-reclining on a slab or stone, played like a young child with the tadpoles in the water, making them swim about, and then fell to moralising on the strong and the weak, the brave and the cowardly, as she chased them with her hand.'1 Ellen Nussey is recalling one of Bronte's rare moments of volubility. Wuthering Heights similarly moralizes on the strong and the weak, and 15 Quoted by G,rin in Emily Bronte, p. 94, but not in Ellen Nussev's own "Reminiscences" as reprinted by The Bronte Society (see note 16). 16 Ellen Nussey, "Reminiscences of Charlotte Bronte," Bronte Society Transactions, II, Pt. 10 (1899), 76.

Nelly, Hareton, and Cathy Linton are also survivors, but, as I shall argue, they pave the way for vitiation of the breed by their voluntary domestication at Thrushcross Grange. The third generation is, therefore, absolutely necessary to Emily Bronte's moral be- cause it is in them that specific strengths and weaknesses of the human animal can be expressed and assessed. Were Wuthering Heights merely a romantic novel, it would have concluded where romantic novels, William Wyler's film version, and many readers' memories of it leave off: with Catherine and Heathcliff dying hap- pily ever after. The sequel might have begun with the posthumous birth of the lonely, lovely, soon-to-be-landless daughter. But that was not Bronte's strategy. Wuthering Heights is, instead, a kind of botanical experiment, the grafting of a bourgeois romance of marriage and property onto a gothic romance of love and death. It is the grafting that attracts those of us who read the novel theoretically, trying to discover what it is really about. Leavis asserts that "Wuthering Heights became a responsible piece of work, once Bronte began to see it as a way to alert her own (Early Victorian) generation [to the dangers of rapid social and ecological change]" (Leavis, p. 101). J. Hillis Miller defines the strategy of Wuthering Heights as that of "a detective story. First the reader encounters the corpse of a dead community. Then the novel explains, by a process of retrospective reconstruction, how things came to be as they are."'7 Miller's "retrospective reconstruction" is more aptly characteristic of Bronte's temperament than Leavis's "way to alert," for Leavis's position assumes that Bronte thinks it possible for humans to reverse the direction of change. For Bronte, as for the Old Testament prophets, it was already too late. Miller, arguing for Bronte's overwhelming sense of doom, thus comes closer to the sociological truth of the novel from an analysis of her religious background. The "soul" of the community had long since been sold; clerical weakness was simply the most obvious symptom, for the Brontes as for William Cowper and George Crabbe before them. I am, however, equally unsatisfied by Miller's version of Bronte's creed, despite agreeing that Bronte herself, in a certain mood, can be heard in Joseph's unsolicited commentary on the action at the Heights. Miller depicts Bronte as wan- dering between the doom of her aunt's Methodism and the optimistic sal- vation of her father's evangelical Anglicanism, both of which conspired to 7 Miller, "Emily Bronte," p. 178. Miller's more recent discussion, "Wuthering Heights: Repetition and the Uncanny," in Fiction and Repetition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982), pp. 42-72, develops his points about the narrative strategy of the novel, without indicating a signficantlv revised interpretation.

For Winifred Gerin, however, Bronte's experiences were themselves sufficient to over- whelm both doctrine and doubt. She locates Bronte's frustration in an obsession with her inability to summon the visions at will (Gerin, chaps. 10- 13, 18). Both of these versions of Bronte's theology are compelling and well supported. Bronte's view of the world was dim, even grim. But "moralising" on the tadpoles comes closer than traditional theologies to the epistemology that informs both Wuthering Heights and Darwin's theory of natural selec- tion. All of the characters, except Heathcliff, are varying mixtures of strength and weakness, cowardice and bravery. The traits they exhibit as children become exacerbated with age. Most of the characters, save Heathcliff, con- fess to a sense of being unable to help themselves when they behave badly, Catherine Earnshaw being the most extreme example.'8 Her daughter, Cathy Linton, is a signficant exception, for she always acts, even misbehaves, deliberately: the child con-artist develops into the only character sufficiently willful to stand up to Heathcliff.19 In short, Emily Bronte's "retrospective reconstruction of how things came to be as they are" speaks for a biological/ psychological destiny, the irreversibility of human nature, regardless of whether her position rests on notions of humankind's fall or an individual's psychological endowment. Wuthering Heights is an hypothetical experiment in the expression of such parental sins or temperamental traits over several generations. Modem readers of Emily Bronte are, in fact, fortunate to have at least a glimpse of Ellis Bell as a "theorist," albeit inchoate, in the surviving French devoirs performed for M. Heger on more or less assigned topics. Though it would be even worse than having our own freshman English papers produced as evidence of our mature thought-worse because of Bronte's linguistic handicap-the essays suggest the "full strength" of the voice to which Charlotte Bronte alludes and are, moreover, consistent with the theoretical nature of Wuthering Heights, composed three to five years later. Of particular psychological interest are "Portrait: King Harold before the Battle of Hastings" and two entirely imaginary letters, one to a mother and the other from a brother to a brother. A bit of relevant sociology can 18 For an important discussion of Catherine Earnshaw's inability to control her behavior, see Leavis, pp. 116 and following.

More pertinent to Bronte's own natural theology are "The Cat," "The Butterfly," and "Filial Love." Each of these essays argues that hu- manity's fall was not shared by the more pristine animals, with the single exception of cats, whose "hypocrisy, cruelty, and ingratitude" are matched only by humans'. "The Cat" opens with the assertion that the speaker loves them, in spite of their human nature, and concludes that cats "owe all their greed and bad qualities to the forefather of humankind, for assuredly, the cat was not wicked in Paradise."20 The essay on "The Butterfly" opens with a description of nature as "an enigma, it exists on a principle of destruction," yet closes with the assertion that God is, in fact, "the god of justice and mercy; then, assuredly, each pain that he inflicts on his creatures, be they human or animal, rational or irrational, ... is but a seed for that divine harvest which will be reaped when sin [has dispensed] its last drop of venom" (Gerin, p. 272). Bronte presents the same data as her contemporary, Alfred Lord Tennyson, showing numerous aspects of "Nature, red in tooth and claw," but without resorting to Tennyson's divorce of either "man" or God from animals or "Nature." Humanity's fall, for Bronte, is the result of a continuously reenacted failure to accept the larger simultaneity of creation and destruction, the larger rationality of apparent irrationality and individual suffering. The essays are, in short, her own renditions of "the argument from design," pushing, however, beyond natural theology to Darwin's re- buttal of anthropocentrism. No discussion of biology or religion in England during the first half of the nineteenth century can avoid the literature of natural theology. It is, therefore, surprising that, for all the discussions of the Brontes' love of "nature" and animals and for all the analyses of animal imagery in Wuthering Heights, there has been no serious examination of the novel in relation to natural theology.2' It is inconceivable that the Brontes could have escaped 20 The complete oeuvre is reproduced as an appendix in Gerin, including the marginal comments of the Hegers.

Charlotte Bronte lists "Bewick and Audubon and Goldsmith [the History of Animated Nature] and White's Natural History [of Selbourne]" in her recommended reading for Ellen Nussey.22 Emily copied drawings from Thomas Bewick's British Birds (1797), and all three sisters did naturalistic portraits of the family pets. Given their obvious interest in natural history, it is probably a persistent sentimentalism (and possibly sexism) regarding the Brontes' in- tellectual isolation that has prevented us from seeing them relatively ag- gressively pursuing scientific interests. Charlotte Bronte/ remarks on this very point in a letter to Ellen Nussey concerning the lectures given by her father and the curate William Weightman at the Keighley Mechanics In- stitute, at least one of which the girls were allowed to attend: "[B]oth are spoken of very highly in the newspaper, and it is mentioned as a matter of wonder that such displays of intellect should emanate from the village of Haworth, situated amongst the bogs and mountains, and, until very lately, supposed to be in a state of semi-barbarism. Such are the words of the newspaper."23 Such interest in the natural sciences would have certainly been en- couraged by Patrick Bronte. As a schoolmaster in Ireland he had instituted field trips and nature studies. He attended Cambridge in the very years of Archdeacon Paley's initial impact and vouchsafed to the local surgeon that he had kept up his scientific studies in the interim.24 His library included textbooks in anatomy, pharmacology, chemistry, and a sadly annotated copy of T. J. Graham's Domestic Medicine (Lock and Dixon, pp. 486, 373). He furthermore participated in the activities of Keighley Mechanics Institute and subscribed to its library. A weekly trek to exchange armloads of books was a task rotated through the family, and the children, much to the horror of some, were allowed to read anything. Two copies of Paley's Moral Phi- losophy and another "Paley" (in the "Beauties of Literature" series) are listed in the 1841 catalogue of the Keighley Mechanics Institute Library.25 Patrick Bronte's sermon on the Crow Hill Bog Burst, furthermore, one of the few of his that survive, opens with the scientific explanation of the phenomenon, as well as Biblical analogues, but proceeds specifically to contrast responses of scientists "who only looked at second causes and grovelled here below" with that of "one who saw by faith through nature to Nature's God" (Lock and Dixon, pp. 250-251).

Paley's Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attri- butes of the Deity, Collectedfrom the Appearances of Nature was a virtual encyclopedia of natural history, anatomy, meteorology, and astronomy, de- scribing phenomena and then explaining them in terms of final causes. The following passage is typical-and almost makes one lament the loss of te- leology for the prose of science: Neither ought it, under this head, to be forgotten how much the instinct costs the animal which feels it; how much a bird, for example, gives up, by sitting upon her nest; how repugnant it is to her organization, her habits, and her pleasures. An animal, formed for liberty, submits to confinement, in the very season when every thing invites her abroad: what is nmore; an animal delighting in motion, made for motion, all whose motions are so easy and so free, hardly a moment, at other times, at rest, is, for many hours of many days together, fixed to her nest, as close as if her limbs were tied down by pins and wires. For my part, I never see a bird in that situation, but I recognize an invisible hand, detaining the contented prisoner from her fields and groves, for a purpose, as the event proves, the most worthy of the sacrifice, the most important, the most beneficial. But the loss of liberty is not the whole of what the procreant bird suffers. Harvey tells us, that he has often found the female wasted to skin and bone by sitting upon the eggs.26 This passage from Paley, like so many others, bespeaks a sentiment, tone, and attitude often encountered in the poetry and prose of Emily Bronte, and is only slightly more vivid and anthropomorphic than Darwin's own descriptions of animal behavior.27 Take, for example, the following passage from Bronte's essay, "Filial Love": "Parents love their children, it is a principle of nature; the doe fears not the dogs when her little one is in danger, the bird would die on her nest: this instinct is a portion of the divine soul which we share with all animals that exist, and has not God placed in the heart of the infant a comparable feeling?" (Gerin, p. 269). Naturally. But Bronte goes on to find little evidence for this instinct in the contem- porary world. Certainly one would not have to have studied Paley to make these observations. But Paley has used, in the cited chapter, the sagacity of the butterfly in knowing where best to deposit the caterpillar larvae as his trump argument for instinct as meta-utilitarian, therefore divinely inspired. "Filial 2 William Paley, Natural Theology (1802; rpt. ed., Houston, Texas: St. Thomas Press, 1972), pp. 225-226. 27 For an interesting analogue to this passage from Paley in Darwin, see The Descent of Man: "At the proper season these birds seem all day long to be impressed with the desire to migrate; their habits change; they become restless, are noisy, and congregate in flocks. Whilst the mother bird is feeding, or brooding over her nestlings, the maternal instinct is stronger than the migratory; but the instinct which is more persistent gains the victory, and at last, at a moment when her young ones are not in sight, she takes flight and deserts them. When arrived at the end of her long journey, and the migratory instinct has ceased to act, what an agony of remorse the bird would feel, if, from being endowed with great mental activity, she could not prevent the image constantly passing through her mind, of her young ones perishing in the bleak north from cold and hunger."

These essays read, in short, very much like critical commentaries on passages in Paley, providing alternative readings of his own "evidences." Darwin adopted the same technique in his notebooks: copying out or referring to passages from the natural theologians, questioning the conclusions to which the authors had come and substituting his own "materialist" interpretation of the ob- servation in question. Even if Emily Bronte had never studied Paley, the literature of natural theology informed the prose she grew up on-Anglican sermons and the periodicals the Bronte children pored over. Another coincidence lurks in the fact that Paley's chief apologist and editor in the Brontes' own time was a professor at the Royal College of Surgeons by the name of Sir Charles Bell. Bell, a forerunner in the field of comparative anatomy, had come to popular attention as the author of the fourth Bridgewater Treatise: The Hand: Its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as Evincing Design.28 The Bridgewater Treaties, which were also to be found in the Keighley library, pushed natural theology to its absurd extreme: where Paley found assurance and comfort in his conviction that all the apparent evil and irrationality in nature could be explained from a God's-eye view, the authors of the Bridge- water Treatises were bound to assert that man himself is God's final cause, that, in the title of the second volume, "External Nature" had been "Adapt[ed] to Man." Bell strongly qualifies the idea that the world was madefor man by stressing the hand and the attendant technology which "convert the being who is weakest in natural defence to the ruler of animate and inanimate nature" (C. Bell, p. 18). Bell thus reiterates the often overlooked point that environments themselves are not stable, but continuously altered by humans, albeit with God's imprimatur, in order to achieve their own adaptation and survival. If one examines the work of the Bronte sisters from the perspective of contemporary thought on the plasticity of human nature, a classic debate along the typical lines of the "nature-nurture" controversy emerges. Bell 28 The Bridgewater Treatises were a series of books whose publication was supported by the estate of the Earl of Bridgewater. Bridgewater had directed that these books should be written by persons nominated by the President of the Royal Society, to demonstrate "the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation, illustrating such work by all reasonable arguments."

SUMMER 1984 491</page><page sequence="16">Barbara Muntson Goff himself so deftly aims for equilibrium between the forces of nature and nurture that I want to suggest him as a possible source for their choice of the pseudonym. The Brontes had access not only to the series of Bridgewater Treatises, but also to a "Phenomena of Nature (Bell's) 2 copies," and, in all likelihood, his edition of Paley, which by their time had become the standard-and required reading in the British universities.29 As an allusion it certainly signifies their work better than the middle name of the newly arrived curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls, despite the fact he would eventually become Charlotte's husband.30 Charlotte's novels can themselves be seen as hypothetical experi- ments in altering the environments of characters familiar to her, in order to bring them to more personally satisfying (for good or ill) ends than actual circumstances had permitted. Shirley is the most immediately relevant: what if a woman of Emily 's fortitude and will had been graced with money and power? The novel became, for Charlotte, a tribute to Emily, who sickened and died in the course of its composition: Shirley Keeldar's ferocity increases in direct proportion with Emily's own stoicism and recalcitrance. The novel captures virtually every memorable incident in Emily's life that has come down to us, including the obsession with animals and an almost pagan worship of nature. But to make these experiments work out as novels, Charlotte frequently resorted to "fudging" coincidences that beg belief and weaken her plots. Anne Bronte's novels are neither hypothetical nor ex- periments. Her avowed intention is "to tell the truth, for truth always conveys its own moral to those who are able to receive it."31 Indeed, she did little more than change the names in recounting episodes from her own and her brother's experiences and clearly implied the morals to be drawn from them. In the nature-nurture debate, Anne thus takes a middle position, believing both that humanity is fallen (though salvageable) and that, at least in her brother's case, unhappy circumstances and human cruelty provide occasion for further deterioration.32 29 Whone, p. 353. If the numbering system indicates the order of acquisition, Bell's "Phenomena of Nature" was one of their first. It mav also be the librarian's designation for The Hand. Other volumes in the series appear as "Bridgewater's [sic] Treatises on Animal and Vegetable Physiology" (p. 346) or under the author's name, with equally adventitious titles. 30 Though Gerin suggests Nicholls as the source of the name, she does not suggest that he may have been drawn into the secret: it would have been a good strategy for Charlotte Bronte to have done so, for mail addressed to a "Mr. Bell" might thus have fallen into the proper hands. Nicholls was, however, not much admired by the sisters at this point. At risk, furthermore, of attacking mv own suggestion twice, I must admit that my sense of Charlotte Bronte's wit persuades me that "Bell" was mlerelv a French pun, the Belles, and (worse vet) "Ellis" was "Hell's Belle." 31 Acton Bell, "Preface," The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848; rpt. ed., New York: Penguin, 1979). VICTORIAN STUDIES 492</page><page sequence="17">BETWEEN NATURAL THEOLOGY AND NATURAL SELECTION Anne and Emily's Gondal saga had more than satisfied, perhaps even exhausted, their need for private fantasies with romantic paper dolls (or wooden soldiers). Emily Bronte's hypothetical experiment in Wuthering Heights is neither a game of supposition nor a "moralising" from direct observation. Emily was more philosophical and far more despairing of the possibility of the perfectibility of human life than her sisters. In the hypo- thetical debate she takes the extreme side of "nature": people are what they are, no matter what they are, no matter what the circumstances, and what they are is fallen from nature itself. Wuthering Heights shows civilization, the process by which people "adapt external nature," as a reversal of the order of nature, making "the being weakest in natural defence" unnaturally strong and unnaturally brave. Edgar Linton, for example, can only bring himself to confront Heathcliff with the accommodation of "a brace of pistols" and a goon squad of peasants. Only the vicious taunting of his mate is sufficient stimulus to bring out the "animal" in him, and a power beyond his control forces him to go for Heathcliffs jugular (chap. 11). It is the moment when we most admire him; usually we are invited only to feel painfully sorry for him. Thrushcross Grange (a place where wealth, in this case the fruits of the labor of peasants, is collected, counted, and stored away) typifies this reversal of God's natural order. If Thrushcross Grange-it is difficult even to pronounce-is the heaven that so many of the characters tell us it is, then "heaven [does] not seem to be [Catherine's] home" (chap. 9)-nor Emily Bronte's. All sociological issues are, by this definition of Bronte's "creed," post-lapsarian, and her commentaries, however telling, merely symptomatic of a more profound vitiation of the species, human beings having become the "artificial [men] of cities." Artificial wealth has made it possible for the inhabitants of Thrushcross Grange, including the tenant Lockwood, to cut themselves off from the land, do no work for a living, and act out a town scenario in the midst of rugged moors, which they keep out of sight and mind by the gardens, fences, and hedges of Thrushcross Park. The Grange allows for the proliferation of moral runts, whose very survival is made possible by peasants and servants. They sicken, even die, at the slightest provocation. Had they been born at Wuthering Heights, Hareton Earnshaw would have hung them by the chairback. Emily Bronte's contempt for them 32 Valentine Cunningham locates a similar distinction in the three sisters' views of human nature bv examining the degree to which each seems to have been influenced by Methodism, in Everywhere Spoken Against: Dissent in the Victorian Novel (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), pp.113-126. His conclusions support the larger point: that it is virtually impossible to distinguish psychology, sociology, or biology from theology in this period. The issues and reactions raised by Edward O. Wilson's "sociobiology" demonstrate the degree to which these distinctions remain unclear, even among scientists, in our own time.

Wuthering Heights is indeed a "retro- spective reconstruction" of how humankind got into this sorry state, sug- gesting that the species has been weakened by poor breeding methods, hyperdomestication, and the hyper-"adaptation of external nature" to hu- manity's fallen nature. III [The Westmorland sheep were] sik as God set upon the land, so they never change any. J. Lawrence, General Treatise on Cattle (1809).33 Though we tend, in retrospect, to blame natural theology and its "argument from design" for crippling the progress of science-certainly constraining, for example, the acceptance of Darwinism in England-it nonetheless made possible the pursuit of scientific investigation within in- stitutions that maintained subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles and royal charters. Natural theology had, since the Renaissance, underpinned natural history, making it possible for priests of such diverse temperaments as Robert Herrick and Gilbert White to pursue their inclinations without com- promising their Holy Orders. Anglican natural theology screened the "pa- ganism" of an Emily Bronte and the "presumption" of the natural sciences from the obscurantist hell-fires of Calvinism. Gavin de Beer points out, furthermore, that Paley "had, in fact, [provided] a catalogue of adaptations that was shortly to come in very useful [for Darwin]."34 Darwin was very well aware of his own debt to Paley, pointing out in his Autobiography that the necessity to "get up Paley" for exams at Cambridge was "the only part of the academic course which, as I then felt, and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the education of my mind."35 Bronte's vision of the natural order of things, as I have suggested, was very close to Darwin's, based, as it may have been, on the same sources- both written and observed-and the same sense of wonder in the beauty, economy, justice, and apparent wisdom of "Nature," in Bronte's case, or "natural selection" in Darwin's. All of Bronte's works bespeak her belief in the "argument from design" and the identity of "Nature" with "God," but differ in her insistence on confronting the thorniest issues: cats with rats' 33 J.

The design of Bronte's universe is far more brutal than Paley's: these cases are not the exceptions, but the rule. And for both Darwin and Bronte, unnecessary cruelty was the distinct feature of human behavior. In nature, death and destruction on a massive scale are necessary for the proliferation of life and variety. Darwin and Bronte shared interest in another line of inquiry, namely the vast body of practical knowledge and lore concerning the breeding of domestic animals, which had been rapidly developing since the middle of the eighteenth century. Indeed, Darwin opens his Origin with an appeal to the prima facie evidence of species variation in the "methodical selection" conducted by breeders of animals.36 The success of Robert Bakewell's New Leicester sheep, a hybrid that produced high quality meat and wool, towards the end of the eighteenth century, and the general interest in "rural im- provement" and "scientific agriculture" gave rise to a number of experiments in what Darwin terms "unconscious, or methodical selection," most notably the attempt on the part of farmers in the West Riding to create an animal with long fine wool that was also hardy enough to survive the terrain. The local variety most admired for its fitness was the "heath sheep," or Linton, named after the market from which they were exported to the Highlands in the middle of the eighteenth century. George Culley's description of the Linton sheep reveals much about the mood of the times: The Heath Breed have large spiral horns, black faces [their distinctive feature], and black legs, a fierce wild-looking eye and a short, firm carcass ... covered with long, open, coarse, shagged wool; the fleeces.. sold in 1792 for 6d. per lb. They are an exceedingly active and hardy race, run with amazing agility, and seem the best adapted of all others to high, exposed heathy, mountainous districts ... what a pity they are not covered with a finer and more valuable fleece! There is no doubt but it might be improved. Indeed it is scarce possible to make it coarser.37 Another agriculturalist displaces the value of "improvement" even further from the animals themselves: "If it were possible to give these animals a less restless nature, and ample fleece of finer wool, without impairing the hardiness and other qualities which fit them so peculiarly for their bleak and barren situations, it would prove the greatest benefit that could be conferred on moorland property."38 The actual "improvement" of the Lin- :36 Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species by means of Nattral Selection (1859; rpt. ed., New York: Atheneum, 1967), chaps. 1, 4. 37 George Culley, Observations on Live Stock, containing Hints for Crossing and Improving The Best Breeds of the Most Usefil Kinds of Domestic Animals (3d ed., London: G.

Such also was the fate of the Lintons of Thrushcross Grange. Another variety of sheep is of more than passing interest to the reader of VWuthering Heights, the Penistone: In the West Riding, and on the borders of Lancashire, a breed of short-woolled sheep has existed from time immemorial. They are horned, with mottled or spotted faces and legs; some of them, however, are white-faced. They are called the Penistone sheep, from the town situated between Sheffield and Huddersfield, to which thev are usually driven for sale.... Towards the north it has been oftener crossed with the heath sheep, and then the legs and faces are black or grey, or spotted: but the fleece is not improved, becoming more coarse and open .. . The short-woolled sheep are diminishing in the West Riding, and the long wools are found wherever the pasture is good enough to support them.39 William Youatt thus describes, in 1837, what was well known to be one of the casualties of these breeding experiments, the loss of the "pure" Penistone variety by crosses with the Lintons, the "heath sheep" to which he refers. Only the Westmorland sheep, referred to at the head of this section, seem to have escaped the permanent deterioration of the Linton cross. Emily Bronte was probably not familiar with the literature of animal husbandry. None of these treatises, not even Arthur Young's classic (and popular) compendium, the Annals of Agriculture (1784-1809), is recorded as being in the Keighley library, despite the fact that such Mechanics In- stitutes were models for the American agricultural colleges. The Brontes' great-great grandfather, however, had been a cattle trader in Ireland, his foster-son Welsh Brunty ferrying the cattle to market in Liverpool.-4 To Patrick Bronte's credit, he was never ashamed of his humble origins, and some of that family lore and knowledge must have been passed on to his children. Charlotte Bronte has Shirley Keeldar taking great and active in- terest in the management and husbandry of her cattle. Local newspapers, furthermore, were full of agricultural information, and such "country mat- ters" would certainly have been known by the peasants and senrants whose conversation Emily Bronte attended to. No competing explanation for her nomenclature in Wuthering Heights is quite so compelling as this, even taking into account that the attributes of the two varieties of sheep reverse those of the characters: the ruggedness, fierce eyes, coarse wool, and black 39William Youatt, Sheep: Their Breeds, Management, and Diseases (London: Sinplan, Mlarshall anI Co., 1837), p. 303. 40 The saga of Welsh Brunts, a foundling from Liverpool wsho brought the Bruntv famil, to financial ruin because they opposed his marriage to his "foster-sister," beggars credulitv and is probably a piece of ex post facto embroidery or blamey on someone's palt, though not necessarily John Cannon's.

Penistone Crags, furthermore, indicates the "Nature" that Heathcliff represents, apart from the house with which he is associated. The Lintons are, however, hyper- domesticated, with the exception of Cathy, who loves the moors and is taken to Penistone Crags by Hareton. With reference to the sheep, furthermore, Emily would have been able to observe only the ex postfacto evidence, the worse aspects of the crossbred sheep that were grazing in the 1830s; she, or her sources, may have been confused about the pedigree of the traits. Emily did have available to her, however, the second Bridgewater Treatise, John Kidd's On the Adaptation of External Nature to the Physical Condition of Man.41 Kidd, the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, opens with a lengthy philosophical speculation on the "animal" nature of human beings, emphasizing their emotional and moral similarities. Later chapters deal with the differences between wild and domesticated varieties and with the anatomical effects of domestication. Though I think Emily Bronte would have stubbornly denied the Bridgewater premise, that humans have a God-given right and ability to subjugate nature, Kidd's treatise would have provided much information as well as grist for her particular theoretical mill. The evidence that Emily Bronte had animal breeding in mind is not only remarkable in itself but reverses, also, most interpretations of the status of "civilization" in the novel. That the novel is literally about domestication- the dialectics of the two houses-is obvious on a first reading. Our difficulty in deciding which of the two houses harbors more perversity is itself a reflection of the reader's own social priorities. Sociological critics like Leavis, Eagleton, and myself have little trouble deciding against Thrushcross Grange, but find ourselves in difficulty when it comes to arguing for Heathcliff and/ or Wuthering Heights: there seems so much blatant cruelty and destruc- tiveness on the premises. Considering that action, however, within the con- text of the realities of rural life-a context not available to most urbane reviewers and critics and, consequently, not brought to bear on the action- goes far toward explaining it as one of the hard facts of a harder way of life, 41 John Kidd, On the Adaptation of External Nature to the Physical Condition of Man, Principally with Reference to the supply of his wants and the exercise of his intellectualfaculties (Philadelphia: Carey, Lea and Blanchard, 1835). It is worth noting, for example, that Kidd cites the cat as the animal least affected by domestication, "less subjugated to man than horses or dogs" (chap. 9). In her essay, "The Cat," Bronte argues that the cat is the animal most like man himself and thus less submissive to mastery. SUMMER 1984 497</page><page sequence="22">Barbara Munson Goff the wisdom of which Bronte accepts.42 Comparing Bronte's vision of nature with Darwin's, finally, goes far toward elucidating the theories of both. Take, for example, the constant routine of culling. People for whom animals are an economic system-and Lockwood has to be told that the nursing pointer is "not kept for a pet" (chap. 1)-do not sentimentalize or anthropomorphize them. Hareton's hanging the litter of puppies is not necessarily the act of gratutious cruelty Isabella implies, especially if we recall the cruelty of our first glimpse of Edgar and herself, who "had nearly pulled [a little dog] in two between them" (chap. 6). Heathcliff clearly does recall the incident, for he pointedly attempts to finish off the job of murder when he elopes with Isabella (chap. 12). Heathcliff s callousness is exhibited by all those whose own bodies are commodities: thus Nelly's contempt for the urchin Heathcliff and Zillah's for the puny Linton Heathcliff. They, like Catherine and Heathcliff, have no use for pampered, "petted things" of any species (chap. 6). Then there is the trapping and shooting-another apparent business venture of Hareton's, to judge by the "heap of dead rabbits" in the corner on Lockwood's first visit. This is a skill Hareton has learned from Heathcliff, as we know from the incident of the lapwings (chap. 12). One of the dubious benefits of civilization is that most of us avoid direct confrontation with the slaughter on which our comfort depends. Those who do it for us, again, do not anthropomorphize the animals upon whose death their own survival more directly depends-erring perhaps too far in the opposite direction. In her essay, "The Butterfly," Emily Bronte, like Paley before her but unlike her contemporary Tennyson, comes to terms with the necessity of death and the obvious indifference of nature, and even God, to human sentiments. The "nest of little [lapwing] skeletons" is God's, winter's, or the mother's work, not Heathcliff's; Catherine's plea that he spare the mother (who wouldn't return anyway) is an act of supererogation, however indicative of her own, more tender feelings. If those who work with animals are less "humane" than those of us who indulge ourselves in them, they also feel a stronger sense of obligation to them, if only on grounds of enlightened self-interest. Emily Bronte took sole responsibility for the care and feeding of the household menagerie and fulfilled her obligations up through the last night of her life. An interchange on this point is instructive. Hareton, Heathcliff, and Cathy Linton argue about how to deal with Lockwood in the snowstorm. Hareton volunteers to 42 Q. D. Leavis is one of the few modem critics to emphasize the fact that Wuthering Heights is a working (however marginally) farm. Charlotte Bronte herself reiterates the point in her "Preface" to justify not only the "ruggedness" of the language but also the frank discussion of such matters as wet-nursing and alcoholism, not usually encountered in the genteel fiction of the times.

And who is to look after the horses, eh?" Cathy surprises Lockwood by "murmur[ing], 'A man's life is of more consequence than one evening's neglect of the horses' " (chap. 2). Emily Bronte did not feel her own life to be worthy of an evening's neglect of the dogs: though Hareton's attempt to answer the needs of the stranger, the sheep, and the horses is the most admirable response of all, I have no doubt that a Lockwood does not sit as high as a horse in Emily Bronte's own hierarchy of animals. "Breeding" in the common parlance of the nineteenth century refers, of course, to the proper nurturance of "civilized" behavior. I have already suggested the ways in which Bronte implies that such "civilized," "artificial" behavior has weakened the breed of animals at Thrushcross Grange. A far more venal definition of breeding characterizes the notions of "bad breed- ing" that so frequently prevented marriage-for-love in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, thus indicating another way in which "methodical selection" had vitiated the upper-middle classes: superficial, invented stand- ards, such as those applied to the sheep of Yorkshire, had not produced survivors. It is interesting to note, in this context, Nelly's use of the term: "[For Cathy to] sneer at [Hareton's] imperfect attempt [at reading ] was very bad breeding" (chap. 24). While Nelly seems to refer to "manners," she is in fact rebuking Cathy for a failure in human decency and a snob- bishness about the Heights that Nelly has deplored through two generations of Lintons already. Such behavior is, indeed, part of Cathy's psychological endowment-"bad breeding." Wuthering Heights selects for a different sort of animal, infinitely more rugged and surviving with little apparent variation for at least 300 years. Outsiders-except Heathcliff-do not hold up well there: the mis- tresses predecease its own offspring, the men and the peasants, who are virtually immortal. It takes years of willful dissipation for Hindley to kill himself off, and his father, like an animal or an American Indian, seems simply to know when life is draining out of him. Catherine has inherited both traits, her brother's self-destructiveness and her father's ability to die at will. Catherine and Hindley, fiurthermore, share a fatal attraction to "what is called 'the world.'" Hindley comes down from university, having "grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed quite differently"; he brings with him a "half-silly . . . rather thin but young, and fresh complex- ioned" wife, in the words of Nelly Dean (chap. 6). The ultimate cause of Hindley's self-destnlction, and the proximate cause of Edgar Linton's, is uxoriousness, an overdependence and overfondness that Catherine, in her better nature, calls being "like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour-fool's palaver that [Heathcliff and I] should be ashamed of" (chap. 3). SUMMER 1984 499</page><page sequence="24">Barbara Munson Goff Heathcliff is even more rugged than the native stock at the Heights, and Catherine has always recognized him as the neighborhood's prize stud. When he returns from "the world," though his "cheeks were sallow.... his manner was even dignified." When Heatheliff is thus groomed with wealth and power, Isabella Linton herself plumps (or more romantically, wastes) for him. Heathcliff 's pedigree is dubious and perhaps irrelevant, for the cities, as Emily Bronte well knows, are an environment in which more than one variety of "artificial man" survives. Thus the suggestion that Bronte is a proto-Social Darwinist misrepresents both. While Social Darwinism seemed to accommodate natural selection to natural theology and/or the idea of progress, it did so in order to justify the status quo of the ruling class: "fitness" most definitely included the ability to attain and maintain wealth. Wuthering Heights, however, suggests again and again that money instead selects for weakness, that it is the poor who are more "fit" for survival- or, at least, that those who do survive the harshness of their "artificially" brutal lives are virtually indestructible if feral. When Heathcliff disappears into "the world," he returns a success, by its standards, a rich man. Heatheliff thus possesses the ability to appropriate any and all forms of power: human kindness, animal ferocity, human abusiveness, the natural elements, money, land, and finally even death and the grave itself, as seen in his "Ghoul"-ish burial arrangements. Rather than Leavis's "plotting device," Heathcliff is a sort of first cause, a Prime Mover, a principle of creation and destruction in whose aura life is both conceived and terminated for the other characters in the novel. Heathcliff attains the status of a "mechanism" in Darwin's terminology, that which drives nature and thus human destiny, the natural selector. Only the equal ferocity of human willfulness-embodied here in Catherine-eludes him. Had Darwin himself been at less pains to eliminate irrelevant speculation on the attributes of Paley's watchmaker from the wonders of the watchworks, he might have identified this mechanism, as easily as Bronte herself seems to, with God. Darwin's notion of "natural selection" falls, with appropriate sci- entific detachment, squarely between the implicit optimism of Alexander Pope's "Whatever is, is right" and the resignation of Martin Heidegger's "The Dreadful has already happened." Natural selection can, however, be directed by the operations of chance and will, for the mechanism, in Dar- win's scheme, is itself conducted by "sexual selection," or the natural se- lection of traits that make one potential mate more attractive than another. The mechanism is tampered with in the "methodical selection" of breeders, and usually to the ruin of the breed. Hareton is the only offspring of sexual selection in the third generation, the product of the true love match between VICTORIAN STUDIES 500</page><page sequence="25">BETWEEN NATURAL THEOLOGY AND NATURAL SELECTION Hindley and Frances. Hindley and Frances are themselves temperamentally well matched, delighting equally in each other and in cruelty to their un- wanted charges, Catherine and Heathcliff. They are both tough--Nelly admires the stoicism with which Frances confronts her terminal illness- but Frances is, unfortunately, "a rush of a lass" (chap. 8), unable to adapt to the harshness of the Heights environment, and dies when childbirth wracks her already-consumptive frame. Cathy Linton and Linton Heathcliff are hybrids, breedings arranged "methodically,"' according to artificially established norms rather than by mutual, natural attraction. Linton Heathcliff is the worst throwback of them all, "blending" (in the pre-Mendelian parlance) both the ferocity of the poor (from his father) and the willfulness and selfishness of his mother, Isabella, the only character in the novel who has no commendable qualities in the eyes of anyone. Even Linton Heathcliff has one or two moments of strength and bravery, for all his physical and emotional weakness: he rebukes Cathy's self-centeredness and defends his foster-brother Hareton from her abuse. Linton also knows himself: "I cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret and repent it, and shall regret and repent it till I die!" (chap. 14). In this, he is even more admirable than Lockwood, who also knows his weak- nesses, but neither regrets, repents, nor changes. Lockwood's one moment of strength and decency, also in defense of Hareton, comes off poorly, more like a correction of Cathy's vocabulary: "'Mr. Hareton is desirous of in- creasing his amount of knowledge,' I said, coming to his rescue. 'He is not envious but erulous of your attainments' " (chap. 31). Catherine Linton is in a class by herself, the most adaptable of all characters: she is able to survive the ruggedness of the Heights but thrives in the civility of the Grange. Her mother's willful temperament, a quality not admired in either of them by anyone in the novel, is sufficient, at least, to hold Heathcliff at bay. Her father's overfondness expresses itself as, rather, a fierce loyalty to those she loves, but she can be equally fierce in her contempt. Methodical selection has produced one case of hybird vigor. Cathy is, furthermore, the character most worth saving, and most in need of it. And she is saved-by her forced confrontation with death. The ultimate mating would, of course, have been that of Catherine and Heathcliff. The attraction between them is asexual, though intensely physical. Indeed, Bronte invokes elementary physical forces-heat, mag- netism, electricity-to describe their contact. Could "the world" or even nature withstand the union of their energies? The conclusion of Wuthering Heights suggests that it could not, that they exist, together, only as ghosts at Penistone Crags. But there is the ghost-child-a product, perhaps, of supernatural selection-who identifies herself to Lockwood as "Catherine SUMMER 1984 501</page><page sequence="26">Barbara Munson Goff Linton," "a waif for twenty years."43 The ghost-child's desperation parallels that of her "half-brother" Linton, when he is locked out of the house by Joseph (chap. 24). Linton curses; the child pleads for Lockwood's mercy. Lockwood, who had himself been locked out in the storm only hours pre- vious, not only denies the child entrance but performs the most gratuitous violence in the novel. So much, Bronte makes clear from the very beginning, for the humanizing gentility of the upper classes. The relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff invokes, as I have suggested, physics more than biology. It exists on a higher energy level than "society" and is thus identified always with Penistone Crags, moorland unadaptable by man and uninhabitable, almost, by the animals whose nature man has altered in an attempt to transform supposed "waste lands" into profitable "property." Wuthering Heights itself can barely withstand the energy level of Heathcliff, for all its native ruggedness. Lockwood's en- counter with the ghost-child introduces a point about the relative strengths of the two different breeds, reiterated throughout the novel, which is sugges- tive of not only the Law of Conservation of Energy but Sigmund Freud's description of the mechanism of repression. Though the inhabitants of Thrushcross Grange are physically weak, they are not endowed with less energy than the hard-working, rough-talking Heights breed. They merely affect lassitude for the sake of gentility. When roused, their virulence exceeds that of the natives of the Heights. Isabella, in fact, thrives in the ambience of emotional and physical violence and pain there, "covet[ing]" Hindley's deadly weapons and "delight[ing]" in plotting her revenge on Heathcliff: "'ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn't miss the chance of sticking in a dart; his weakness was the only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong' " (chap. 17). Compare this with Heathcliff himself: "'I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething, and I grind with greater energy, in proportion to the increase of pain'" (chap. 14). There is a world of difference in Isabella's "tast[ing] delight" in revenge and the pain of Heathcliffs "moral teething." It is the fact that "worms" continue to writhe that arouses Heathcliff s urge to destroy them, just as the speaker of Bronte's "The Butterfly" "crush[es] out [the] entrails" of the flower-destroying caterpillar. Human injustice and cruelty evoke both pain and energy in him. It is here, in Heathcliffs determination to select for humane traits, that we find the sociological, moral, and theological center of the novel. 43 A child of Catherine Linton would be, legally, named Linton, regardless of paternity. If, as Sanger demonstrates, Bronte knew property and estate law, she certainly knew this point re: legitimacv. Heathcliffs "Cathy" was never both a child and a Linton. VICTORIAN STUDIES 502</page><page sequence="27">BETWEEN NATURAL THEOLOGY AND NATURAL SELECTION IV Teeth are contrived to eat, not to ache; their aching now and then, is incidental to the contrivance, perhaps inseparable from it: or even, if you will, let it be called a defect in the contrivance; but it is not the object of it. William Paley, Moral Philosophy.44 Perhaps Paley's own exemplum of teeth provided Bronte with a source for what is, for me, the most provocative moment in the novel: Heathcliffs declaration of the state of "moral teething." Regardless of whether Bronte refers consciously to Paley, her variation on his theme measures precisely the distance between natural theology and Darwin. Paley, for his part, seems to go out of his way not to cite the function of teeth most typically associated with "Nature, red in tooth and claw." Bronte herself, like Darwin, confronts the necessity of "murder" in nature head-on, as the precondition for finding the terms in which to accept its ultimate, natural "rightness," morality. The moral distinction of humans from animals, for both Bronte and Darwin, is one (to reverse Darwin's phrase) of kind and not degree: the development of a thriving agriculture precluded the ne- cessity for ruthless overkill to guarantee survival. Human brutality, "sav- ageness" in the midst of plenty, is an index, for Bronte, of how far we have fallen from the instincts of natural humaneness. God rebukes the speaker of Bronte's "The Butterfly" because she squashes the "ugly" caterpillar by presenting the simultaneous vision of the exquisite butterfly: death and destruction in nature are thus tempered by life and variety. Heathcliff is far more justified in his "yearn[ing] to crush out ... entrails," for he has, indeed, been personally abused and deprived by the human worms. Nor would Cathy or Hareton transform into anything more beautiful than cat- erpillars without Heathcliffs intervention. The notion of "moral teething" seems in need of a gloss, for the passage is cited repeatedly, especially by readers who do not reverence Heathcliff, as paradigmatic of his "sadism."45 This interpretation seems grossly to overlook the details of the text-Heathcliff only "yearn[s]" and one "grind[s]" one's own teeth-but an obvious fact about grinding and teething: 44William Paley, The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy (1785, 11th American ed.; rpt. ed., Houston: St. Thomas Press, 1977), pp. 60-61. The section from which this passage is taken was quoted by Palev hmself in Natural Theology (p. 347). Not one, but "2 copies" of the "Moral Philosophy" are listed in the Keighley catalogue. (See above, note 25.) Readers may share my horror that both of Paley's works have been reprinted by an Episcopal press in Houston as its contribution to the Creation Science movement: know-nothingism thus makes strange bedfellows of American nostalgia for High Church Anglicanism and fundamentalism. 45 Miller, for example, introduces his discussion of this passage with the statement, "No other figure in English literature takes so much pleasure in causing pain to others" (italics mine), "Emilv Bronte." p. 196. SUMMER 1984 503</page><page sequence="28">Barbara Munson Goff the processes hurt only the teether. Post-Darwinian, sadder-but-wiser en- lightenment, moreover-as distinct from Paley's insistent Panglossianism- demonstrates how and why aching teeth are indeed "inseparable from [the contrivance]." Mammals cannot grow to an adaptive adulthood without the process of teething, nor, to return to Bronte's analogy, can humans develop morally without an aching awareness of the weakness of oneself and others. Heathcliff's return to the scene of his pain is, if anything, more masochistic than sadistic. He came to Wuthering Heights already having learned how to survive Liverpool. He next had to learn how to survive Hindley's brand of meanness. But with Catherine, he learned also how to love and to trust-only to be betrayed by her. Bereft of his "human" soul in Catherine, he is left to contend only with the "worms." That these worms thrive-to endow the world with nothing but worms-generates Heath- cliff 's "greater energy" and spiritual pain. His state of "moral teething" thus corresponds with that of the Old and New Testament, or at least Miltonic God: Heathcliff is both ruthless in his wrath and broken-hearted by the fall of his "angel," the fall of Man from Himself, the human fall from nature- initiated, literally, by Catherine's fall at Thrushcross Grange. Once Heath- cliff has determined, like the successful Yorkshire sheep-breeder, to cull "the weak ewes and small lambs" from the Linton stock, he becomes both natural and methodical selector. The "greater energy" with which he "grind[s]" is not simply a principle of life and death, but also one of absolute and inexorable justice: Bronte herself seems to "taste the delight" of Heath- cliff s "paying wrong for wrong"-though she defines the injuries quite differently from Isabella. Bronte gives us a third generation and "second" novel to show us this principle in action, to "justify the ways of [her] God to man." The Creator is often apparently cruel. Heathcliffs treatment Qf these children evokes the always problematic fact of "the sins of the fathers," a point upon which modern genetics is even more emphatic than old-time religion. But exactly how cruel is Heathcliff? Hareton and Linton both love him. How terrible is it to have raised Hareton as a hard-working, proud, self-sufficient farmer? Once Heathcliff has acquired the Grange, who would inherit both it and Wuthering Heights? What good did violin lessons do Hindley and a "plaid silk frock" Catherine? Heathcliff is, rather, determined to keep Har- eton pristine, to suppress any expression of that fatal attraction for gentility that has destroyed Hareton's father and aunt. It is Cathy Linton who poses the moral quandary for the reader. She never comes around to "loving" Heathcliff-and I suppose we can under- stand that, for she is the one who is most seriously abused by him, financially, verbally, physically, and emotionally. Cathy alone is defiant and unafraid of VICTORIAN STUDIES 504</page><page sequence="29">BETWEEN NATURAL THEOLOGY AND NATURAL SELECTION him, her birthright from her mother, and is never chastened or swayed from her own willfulness. But Heathcliff seems to have a long-range plan for her also, beyond the enforced marriage to his moribund son. He teaches her the true value of life by rubbing her nose in death, forcing her to witness the prolonged agony of Linton's spiritual and physical weakness. It is, of course, Cathy's own innate sympathy with suffering (her mother's legacy) and her loyalty to the family (her father's) that give her the strength for her ordeal. That it is all part of Heathcliffs "design" is revealed by his first word to her when it is over: [Heathcliff] wvent up, held the light to Linton's face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards lie tlurned to her. "Now-Catherine," he said, "how do vou feel?" She was dllilb. "How do vou feel, Catherine?" he repeated. "He's safe, and I'm free," she answered, "I should feel swell-but," she continued w ith a blitterness she couldnlt conceal, "youl have left me so long to strugglle against death, alone, that I feel and see only death! I feel like death!" And she looked like it, too! I gave her a little xwine. (chap. 30). Nelly, in her inimitable style, undercuts the high seriousness of the whole scene. Cathy Linton has survived Heathcliff's ordeal and now knows death. She is also saved, as well as "free." Nelly, whom Charlotte Bronte has characterized in the "Preface" as "a specimen of true benevolence," in one gesture both belies her mixed feelings for Cathy and administers a com- munion. Cathy Linton is about to begin to become humane, able now to begin to love Hareton and to be worthy of his love for her. She is now also "free" to marry him-and equally free to corrupt his strength with her own relative frailty. One of the reasons for Wuthering Heights' narrative and dramatic success is, as I have been suggesting, Emily Bronte's identification with the strengths and weaknesses of all of the characters she creates, with the exception of Heathcliff, who is an ideal, a projection of her understanding of God. Bronte herself struggled, more successfully than Catherine, to "[be] Heathcliff," that Designer/Nature/God who is "always, always in my mind," whose soul is identical with her own. Her sister Charlotte seems to have understood this, for the description of Emily's terminal illness in the "Bi- ographical Notice" of the 1850 edition alludes unmistakably to Heathcliff s greater energy": Yet, while physically she perished, mentally, she grew stronger than we had vet known her ... indeed, I have not seen her parallel in anything. Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood alone. The awful point was, that, while flll of ruth for others, on herself she had no pity; the spirit was inexorable to the flesh; from the trembling hand, the unnerved limbs, the faded eyes, the same service was enacted as they had rendered in health. SUMMER 1984 505</page><page sequence="30">Barbara Munson Goff Wuthering Heights is about the colossal stupidity, arrogance, even impiety of anthropocentrism. So, also, is Darwin's Origin of Species: Darwin describes the denial of species variation in the face of the obvious evidence of our own "methodical selection" as our "ignor[ance of] all general argu- ments, and refus[al] to sum up in [our] minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations" (chap. 1, p. 29). Darwin's suggestion that "methodical selection" itself indicates not only arrogance, what we call today "playing God," but also ignorance is even more evident in his original term for the breeding of animals, "unconscious selection." The following passage (also from Origin) illustrates Darwin's own vision of humankind's reduction of nature to an "abnormal" state of artifice, unfit for survival-a view that closely matches Bronte's in its contempt for the civilized admi- ration of "external[s]" and for the human arrogance, ignorance, "uncon- scious[ness]" of the subtler design of nature: On the views here given of the all-important part which selection by man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. (chap. 1, pp. 38-39). Darwin is only more hopeful than Bronte that Nature/Justice/Heathcliff- "selection"-will always have the last word. A final point from Charles Bell may also go far toward explaining the method of Bronte's madness, or at least, in the words of her sister's "Preface," the "advisab[ility of creating] characters like Heathcliff." Bell, in the fourth Bridgewater Treatise, is deploring the fact that we seem more aware of God in the apparent evil of the Design than in its obvious per- fection: "Debased in some measure by a habit of inattention, and lost to all sense of the benevolence of the Creator, [one] is roused to reflection only by overwhelming calamities, which appear to him magnified and dis- proportional; and hence arises a conception of the Author of his being more in terror than in love" (C. Bell, pp. 13-14). Bronte creates a character whose "terror" may arouse the debased and "vitiated" reader of novels to a con- ception of his love, given, as she tells us in "The Butterfly" and as Bell asserts here, that mankind seems actually to prefer to fix on destruction and ugliness rather than on creation and beauty. In one final attempt to read between the lines of Charlotte Bronte's misleading "Preface," I suggest that even she realizes that "Heathcliff, in- deed, stands unredeemed," because Heathcliff alone needs no redemption. VICTORIAN STUDIES 506</page><page sequence="31">BETWEEN NATURAL THEOLOGY AND NATURAL SELECTION "Moral teething," growing up, understanding how weak, how cowardly, how cruel the human "worms" can be, is redemption in itself, and it hurts. Bronte's "Love"-for God, for humans, and for animals-is humanity's only redeeming social value, the sense of "an existence of yours beyond you," in the words of Catherine Earnshaw (chap. 9). Love hurts too. The blessing and the curse of love, in Emily Bronte's scheme, is that it is beyond one's own control, one's powers of manipulation, one's own will. Love is fatal to solipsism, and it is no wonder Lockwood is "a fixed unbeliever" in it (chap. 7). The novel ends with Hareton about to bite the apple, about to leave the self-sufficiency of the Heights for the debilitating dependency of the Grange, out of love for Cathy. The ending seems to be a happy one. Even Heathcliff had described the Grange as a paradise at first sight: " 'We saw- ah! it was beautiful-a splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson- covered chairs and tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shim- mering with little soft tapers... [Catherine and I] should have thought ourselves in heaven!'" (chap. 6). By the end of the novel, all of us know better, except Hareton, who is as ignorant of it as he is of the ways of "the world." Nelly knows better too, but, as Hindley's "foster-sister," she has perhaps acquired the fatal attraction for gentility and is only slightly less culpable because she is a servant. Thrushcross Grange is, for her, a step up the social Chain of Being. Nelly welcomes the move as an escape from the hard, unlettered ruggedness of the Heights, as wet-nursing Hareton had formerly provided "relief from [her] rake" (chap. 8). Lockwood is, as I have suggested, not only stupidly anthropocentric, but egocentric, solipsistic, and spiritually, if not physically, the most recessive character in the novel, lacking even Linton Heathcliffs ability to love-or insatiable need for it. In Miller's words, the man who "has been a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year's standing witness[es] a love that has lasted beyond the grave" (Miller, p. 169). Like the narrator of Paley's Natural Theology, Lockwood "cross[es] a heath" and stumbles upon phenomena in need of explanation.46 Undaunted by the wrongheadedness of all his hy- potheses, Lockwood proceeds to the end, unredeemed by his experience of Heathcliff and unable to rise above a worldliness that leaves Catherine and Heathcliff in their graves, "sleepers in that quiet earth," reports to the contrary notwithstanding. There is a consolation, however: his refusal to love eliminates his traits for the future. 46 The famous opening proposition of Paley's Natural Theology, p. 1. SUMMER 1984 507</page><page sequence="32">Barbara Munson Goff The true ending of XWuthering Heights pushes beyond Lockwood's vision, beyond the "second" novel, into the future. It is as poignant and unresolved as that of Paradise Lost. Hareton, like Milton's Adam, has just fallen as a result of love. Despite the fact that Hareton and Cathy walk the moors by night, the genes for gentility have won the day. We are left to wonder how many generations it will take for a little Edgar and Isabella Earnshaw to be discovered "nearly pull[ing] a little dog in two between them." Nelly, to be sure, and Hareton, as it seems, are perfectly delighted to have "the world" on Cathy Linton's terms, to move with her back to Thrushcross Grange, which is where, I suppose, a farmer with an acquired taste for primroses in his porridge belongs. We are left only with the satisfaction that Wuthering Heights remains relatively untouched by Cathy's corruption. She had attempted a plantation scheme, replacing Joseph's currant bushes with flowers. Heathcliff, as one of his final acts in this world, puts an end to her efforts and declares that the fruit-bearing bushes be restored, Joseph thus "regain[ing]" for his be- loved currants, their "blissfll seat." That Emily Bronte is, again, of one mind with Heathcliff may be inferred from this final observation from Ellen Nussey, who laments the transformation of the Haworth Parsonage into a tourist attraction: where it had formerly, she tells us, "possessed only a few stunted thorns and shrubs, and a few currant bushes which Emily and Anne treasured as their own bit of fruit garden [it] is now a perfect Arcadia of floral culture" (Nussey, p. 83). Joseph and Zillah, the last of the true-bred peasants, repossess Wuthering Heights in the original terms of Nature's lease.When they die, however, the species will have become extinct, unable to adapt to the hyperadapted local environment. Such had, in fact, become the reality for this endangered species by Emily Bronte's own time, forty years later. The Heights stands as its fossil, and Wuthering Heights, her requiem for a lost natural and humane life and her assault on that "vitiated class of English readers" who drove the sheep away and refuse to believe that ghosts and God still walk the "waste" land.
